If you live anywhere near Avonmouth, you may be familiar with an event that takes place at the start of each month.
Well, we say an event – it's more of an alert. And it's always at exactly the same time, the 3rd of the month, at 3pm.
But with some of these areas – particularly Portishead – attracting lots of newcomers over the past decade, hearing an 'air raid' siren in the middle of the afternoon has created a bit of confusion.
In 2017, Portishead resident Giacomo Squintani helpfully decided to post on Facebook to clear up the mystery.
Well, sort of.
He wrote: "Note for anyone who's moved to Portishead in the last month.
"Don't panic when you hear loud sirens at 3pm tomorrow (Tuesday, January 3).
"As long as you take the right precautions beforehand, you'll be fine.
"See, every month, at 3pm on the third day, an alien spaceship lands in an unused building somewhere in Avonmouth Docks, its evil crew proceeding to violently kidnap people within a few miles' radius before disappearing back to their faraway galaxy.

"Obviously we don't know exact numbers, as nobody's ever returned. That notwithstanding, an educated guesstimate is that the bloodthirsty demons are not satisfied until they've captured around 250 everyday people like you and me. Like your parents, like your children. However, we are confident that they only snatch people carelessly wandering outdoors...
"...so, as long as tomorrow -and on every third day of every month- you lock yourselves in, you should be just about fine. And don't look out of your windows. Never. Look out. Of your windows. At 3pm. On the third day. Never. Ever. Ever.
"(Not in Portishead, anyway.)"
The post generated a lot of laughs – but one poster responded: "Seriously you jest, but I cr****d myself when I moved here 18 months ago......I wasn't warned! Been in a new job a few weeks and thought I was hearing things in the office!"

The sound is actually the Severnside Siren and it is designed to warn people of possible incidents involving dangerous substances around Avonmouth.
It is maintained by an independent charitable organisation, the Severnside Sirens Trust, and can be heard in areas such as Portishead, Avonmouth, Shirehampton, Pilning and Severn Beach.
But providing you hear it on the 3 of the month, it's just a test (or a very big co-incidence).
The test siren includes a 3 minute "Alert" tone, 1 minute silence, and a 1 minute "All-Clear" tone.
In an actual emergency, the Police will trigger the Severnside Sirens from Police Headquarters in Portishead.
The sound of the siren will be a rising continuous note followed by a series of pulsing notes and will be sounded repeatedly while the hazard persists; and the media will be kept informed and broadcasts will be made regularly.
Official advice is to:
1. Go indoors and stay there. Do not collect children from school as they will be properly cared for.
2. Close windows and doors.
3. Listen to your local radio. Follow any instructions you are given.
4. Put out or damp down any fires & boilers. Shut down any ventilation devices.
5. Do not leave the area unless you urgently need help or you are advised to do so.
6. Do not use telephones unless you urgently need help.This will keep phone lines free for emergency use.
7. Stay indoors until you are advised otherwise or the all clear is sounded by the Severnside Sirens.
Johannesburg: 15-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal is thrilled to learn that he would return to the number one spot in the ATP Rankings for the first time in three years.
Swiss maestro Roger Federer on Monday withdrew from this week`s ATP Cincinnati Masters tournament, thus paving way for Nadal to climb to the number one spot for the first time since July 2014.
Federer, who lost to Alexander Zverev in the finals of Montreal Masters, said that a back injury will force him to miss the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament.
"For me to be in that position is something very special," Sport24 quoted Nadal as saying.
"I have the passion and love for the game. That`s why I`m able to be back in that position again," he added.
Nadal will overtake Britain`s top-ranked Andy Murray, who withdrew from Montreal and Cincinnati with a hip injury. The 31-year-old has won four tournaments this year, including historic 10th titles at Roland Garros, Monte-Carlo and Barcelona. He has also reached three other finals, including the Australian Open and Miami.
The Spaniard has struggled with knee injuries since first becoming world number one in August 2008 after a Cincinnati semi-final run.
He admitted doubting he could ever regain the top spot after so many years.
"If you don`t have doubts, it`s because you are very arrogant and I`m not very arrogant," Nadal said.
"There`s a young generation up and coming. It`s very tough to come back and be number one," he added.
Federer, however, could yet move into the world number one spot at the US Open which begins August 28 in New York.

New figures have revealed the number of people in employment in Bristol and the surrounding region has risen at its fastest rate in 18 months.
Firms in the South West enjoyed a month of solid growth in July with employment rising at a healthy rate, according to the latest Lloyds Bank UK Regional PMI survey.
The bank says the increase in job creation underlined an overall improvement in the region's economic performance, with firms in the area seeing growth in new business orders and output levels.
The South West PMI rose to 54.0 in July, up from 52.6 in June. A reading greater than 50.0 signifies growth in business activity, whereas below 50 indicates a decline.
Data for July also showed another rise in input costs – including raw materials, salaries, rent and other overheads - partly due to the weak pound and rising pay. This caused firms to pass on some of their cost burden to customers by upping selling prices for goods and services.
The Lloyds Bank PMI, or purchasing managers' index, is based on responses from manufacturers and service providers about the volume of goods and services produced during July compared with a month earlier.
David Beaumont, regional director for SME banking in the South West at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: “The South West economy regained momentum at the start of the second half of the year. Businesses were able to create new regional jobs at the fastest rate since January 2016 thanks to increased demand for their goods and services.
“Adding to the positive picture, local firms are now expecting to complete more new work in the year ahead. This will likely give the region's economy a further boost in the months to come; though elevated inflationary costs remain a problem for most.”
A compelling mix of NAS and router, though you do pay more for those advanced features, and needs more third-party apps.
In 2017, expecting our digital devices to 'do more' is pretty much par for the course. The rise of smartphones has meant that it's now easy for device-makers to throw an inexpensive ARM processor – like what's at the heart of our smartphones – in just about anything, leading to the rise of 'smart' gadgets across the entire tech space, and often beyond. Of course, 'smart' doesn't always equal 'better' – features have to actually be useful to make them worth paying for, and when it comes to 'smart routers' previous attempts have been a bit hit and miss. A few different networking vendors have tried the 'router with apps' approach, but most have hit the exact same roadblock: a lack of useful apps.
Synology's the latest company to take a stab at the 'smart router' concept, but while the Taiwanese device-maker has a long and well-respected history with network-attached storage (NAS) boxes, it's actually fairly new to the router game – the RT2600ac is only its second offering, following up on the RT1900ac that was released back in late 2015.
The rear of the RT2600ac offers a rather standard array of ports and buttons.
There's a fairly good reason for that: despite no lack of effort, it's tough for outsiders to break into the router game – it's a space that, for the last decade, has largely been dominated by big players like Netgear, Linksys, D-Link and TP-Link.
Synology has been fighting a bit of an uphill battle then, but its prowess in the NAS arena has bought it a lot of good will. With the latter products, it's managed to foster an enthusiastic community of NAS fans and developers, meaning there are a lot of third-party applications that enhance and extend what its NAS devices can do. And that's something Synology has been hoping it'll be able to transfer over to its routers.
The caveat is that you do pay a bit more than average to get those more advanced features, with the RT2600ac selling for $330/£260/AU$390 – that's about 30-40 percent more than similarly-specced routers from other vendors; see ASUS's RT-AC87U as an example.
Hardware features & specifications
So, how does this second 'smart' router differ from its forebear? Externally, it shares the same general 'function-over-form' vibe as the 1900ac — it's textured black body isn't particularly sleek or sexy but, on the plus side, it at least doesn't call too much attention to itself. Its hind feet are longer than average, so the back does sit high and means the whole thing tilts at a sharp angle.
From the outside, the most immediately-noticeable change from its forebear is the RT2600ac's addition of an extra Wi-Fi antenna, making for a total of four (all of which are removable) to match the internal 1,733Mbps (on 5GHz) and 800Mbps (on 2.4GHz) '4x4' 802.11ac radio setup.
Round the back there's the same quota of four Gigabit Ethernet ports alongside a Gigabit internet (aka WAN) port – there's no built-in ADSL, VDSL or cable modem, so you'll need to BYO in that area.
The RT2600ac's four antennas are all removable.
There's also a pair of USB ports – one 2.0 on the back and one 3.0 on the side — which are ostensibly for plugging in storage devices, although you can also attach a printer or 3G/4G USB dongle to give yourself a fallback connectivity option in the case your main broadband line fails. And for photography fans, there's additionally an SD card reader on the front edge of the router – potentially handy for backing up photos and video to any USB-connected drives.
Synology's built a shedload of physical buttons on the RT2600ac, too – as well as the relatively common WPS and power buttons, there's also a Wi-Fi on/off switch and an eject button for safe removal of USB drives or SD cards.
A USB 3.0 port lives on the left side of the device, around the corner from the front-mounted SD card reader. There's an eject button for safely removing storage devices from both.
However, this unit's most significant changes over its predecessor are its the internal hardware upgrades — like the RAM increase from 256MB to 512MB and the trading-up from a dual-core 1GHz processor to a faster 1.7GHz model (specifically the ARM Qualcomm IPQ8065). The 802.11ac Wi-Fi chops have likewise been bumped up from AC1900-class to AC2600 – as we mentioned above, that means you get theoretical speeds of 1,733Mbps on 5GHz and 800Mbps on 2.4GHz (that's compared to the RT1900ac's 1300Mbps and 600Mbps, respectively).
Now, while that's not quite cutting-edge in terms of Wi-Fi specifications – AC2600 devices have been available for a couple of years now, and we've since seen the arrival of theoretically-faster multi-radio AC3200 and AC5300 routers – for home and small office needs, that spec should be ample for the next few years. And it includes all the useful 802.11ac Wi-Fi features like MU-MIMO and beam-forming, which can both help to increase transfer speeds and more-evenly share available wireless bandwidth when multiple devices are connected.
Rounding out those internal specs is 4GB of internal flash storage for running the OS and installing any desired extra apps or services.

Jose Mourinho has regained that familiar glint in his eye and his touchline swagger.
Manchester United are on the march once more, six straight leagues wins - and seven overall - after Monday's 2-0 victory at West Ham pushing them to the brink of the top four.
Mourinho's substitutions won the game, referee Mike Dean did his best to spoil it with a ridiculous red card and yet one of the most telling moments came at the final whistle.
The Special One marched onto the pitch, flung his arms around David De Gea and thanked his keeper for two brilliant, match-winning saves.
De Gea was the only player to get a hug from Mourinho.
United were not at their best, De Gea bailed them out and yet they still have an unstoppable momentum which has carried them menacingly from mid-table up to sixth.

West Ham can count themselves desperately unlucky, because Sofiane Feghouli was harshly sent off after just 15 minutes for a challenge on Reds defender Phil Jones.
It was a decision which ultimately spoiled the game and must raise further question marks about Dean and whether he is good enough to referee at Premier League level.
He has now sent off five players in 15 games, more than any other Premier League referee and you can only sympathise with West Ham as it was a bad decision.
Feghouli did lunge in on Jones but Dean will surely regret giving a red card when he sees the incident again.
It was careless, but never a sending-off — and Jones' corresponding challenge was every bit as bad.
In fact, a Cheikhou Kouyate foul on Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the second half was far worse and did not even bring a yellow card.

TV replays also showed that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 78th minute clincher was offside, but by then there was almost an air of resignation about Dean's ineptitude.
Video technology cannot come soon enough.
Man United did look jaded, suffering from playing two games in 48 hours having beaten Middlesbrough on Saturday and even though West Ham - who have had the same schedule - went down to ten men very early it did not look a mismatch.
The visitors should have gone ahead after 36 minutes but the Hammers survived one of the most incredible goalmouth scrambles you will ever see.
Ibrahimovic's low cross found Mkhitaryan.
He pinged the ball across goal to Antonio Valencia, whose shot forced a remarkable save from West Ham keeper Darren Randolph.
The ball came back out to Jesse Lingard, who smashed the follow-up against a post from point-blank range.

It was an incredible miss — and an amazing let-off as goal-line technology showed Valencia's shot did not fully cross the line.
De Gea made a sensational save to deny Manuel Lanzini's curling shot a minute before half-time and then Michail Antonio also wasted a great headed chance.
Mourinho threw Juan Mata on at half-time, then introduced Marcus Rashford after 58 minutes and the youngster's pace and freshness put West Ham on the back foot.
But the game's biggest turning point came after 61 minutes.
Lanzini threaded a ball to Antonio and the West Ham midfielder raced clean through, but De Gea made a brilliant block.
Two minutes later, Rashford tricked his way down the left, his turn fooled Harvard Nordveit and Pedro Obiang and he cut the ball back for Mata to fire home from 15 yards.
Mourinho's brilliant double substitution had paid rich dividends and, down the years, it has been those moments which have made him such a successful manager.
Maybe the old magic is back.

West Ham had a let-off after 77 minutes when Randolph spilled Rashford's shot against his own post, but their fortune ran out a minute later when the home side failed to clear, and Ander Herrera slid the ball through.
TV replays showed three players - including Ibrahimovic - were offside. But the Swede did not need asking twice, slamming a shot into the far corner for his 12th goal in 12 games.
No-one now should write off Manchester United from having a big say in the title run-in.
A desperate manhunt has been launched to find a terrorist who reportedly shouted 'Allahu Akbar' before shooting dead 39 people in an Instanbul nightclub packed with New Year's Eve partygoers.
Islamic State have claimed responsibility for the attack that saw a further 69 people injured as the killer stormed the Reina nightclub in Istanbul armed with an AK-47 and began blasting people at will.
Turkish police have released the first picture of the prime suspect in the Istanbul nightclub attack, as the gunman remains on the run.
As many as 16 of those that died in the attack are thought to be foreign nationals but none are believed to be British.
The horror began after New Year's Eve early this morning when the gunman arrived outside the club in a yellow taxi.
He then shot dead a policeman stationed outside before storming in and opening fire with an assault rifle.
Chilling CCTV showed the killer dressed in a woolly hat shooting at random outside the club before he stormed inside.
Tampa police divers are searching for a man who was seen in the waters of McKay Bay.
Witnesses said they saw the man about 7:30 p.m. in the water south of the 2600 block of Corrine Street, then go under the water but not resurface.
Divers with the Tampa Police Department and the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office are actively searching for the man.

Moscow: North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile which it believes can reach the west coast of the United States, a Russian lawmaker just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.
Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament`s international affairs committee, and two other Russian lawmakers visited Pyongyang on Oct. 2-6, Russia's RIA news agency reported.
"They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile. They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States," RIA quoted Morozov as saying.
"As far as we understand, they intend to launch one more long-range missile in the near future. And in general, their mood is rather belligerent."
Morozov`s comments drove up the price of U.S. Treasury bonds, as investors worried about the prospect of new North Korean missile tests moved into assets the market views as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.
Reuters was not able to independently verify Morozov`s account, and he did not specify which North Korean officials had given him the information about the planned test.
His delegation had "high-level" meetings in Pyongyang, RIA news agency said, citing the Russian embassy in the North Korean capital.
Tensions over North Korea's nuclear programme have been running high in the past several weeks since Pyongyang staged a series of missile tests, and conducted a text explosion on Sept. 3 of what it said was a hydrogen bomb.
There has also been an exchange of tough rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington.
US President Donald Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea if it threatens the United States. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un responded by calling Trump deranged and saying he would pay dearly for his threat.
"BELLICOSE RHETORIC"
Morozov is a member of the LDPR, a right-wing populist party. It casts itself as an opposition party, but hews close to the Kremlin line on matters of international affairs.
Describing meetings with North Korean officials, Morozov said they "displayed serious determination and bellicose rhetoric," RIA reported.
"The situation, of course, demands the swiftest intervention of all interested states, particularly those represented in the region, in order to prevent wide-scale military action," the agency quoted him as saying.
Russia has closer relations with Pyongyang than many other world powers, linked in part to Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and the current leader's grand-father, having lived for a time in the Soviet Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has joined other world powers in condemning North Korea`s weapons programme, but has taken a softer line than Western governments.
Putin has said that Pyongyang will not be cowed into giving up its weapons programme. He has accused Washington of trying to effect regime change in North Korea, and predicted that would unleash chaos.
U.S. Treasury prices surged on the report of a possible new missile test, pulling yields lower, as investors cut risk out of their portfolios and sought the safety of Treasuries. Treasury prices move inversely to their yields.
Benchmark 10 year U.S. Treasury yields fell from the session high 2.40 percent mark to 2.35 percent around midday (1600 GMT) in New York.
"It has just been risk-off buying into the long (Columbus Day) weekend ... You look at the charts, it has really been a one-way trade of lower yields," said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.
'The Florida Project' Presents A Thrillingly Alive Portrait Of Childhood
Director Sean Baker's new film centers on a six-year-old girl living in a dumpy motel complex outside of Orlando. Critic Justin Chang says The Florida Project "packs an emotional wallop."
DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. The writer-director Sean Baker took the 2015 Sundance Film Festival by storm with "Tangerine," a gritty comic portrait of two transgender prostitutes in Los Angeles. Two years later, he's back with a look at another marginalized community in "The Florida Project," which arrives in theaters today after playing the Cannes, Toronto and New York Film Festivals. Film critic Justin Chang has this review.
JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: "The Florida Project" is one of the most thrillingly alive portraits of childhood I've ever seen. It's a neo-realist sugar rush of a movie, like a 21st century American update of "Los Olvidados" or "Bicycle Thieves" reimagined in rainbow sherbet colors and sprinkled with Pop Rocks. The writer-director Sean Baker and his co-writer, Chris Bergoch, shape the stuff of one girl's turbulent upbringing into a raw, exuberant comedy that darkens almost imperceptibly into tragedy. It packs an emotional wallop like nothing else I've seen this year. For two hours, the movie suspends us in the day-to-day rhythms of life at the Magic Castle, a dumpy three-story motel complex in Kissimmee, Fla., just south of Orlando.
With its bright purple walls and discount fairy tale trappings, the Magic Castle was clearly modeled on Disney World, though any tourists who wind up here generally do so by accident. It's a place where drifters and stragglers rent out cramped rooms for 38 bucks a night and where local missionaries pass out baked goods and brawls erupt in the parking lot. Most of all, it's a place where kids run free, making all sorts of mischief that their guardians are too busy or too neglectful to notice.
The most neglected of these little rascals is Moonee, a wildly energetic 6-year-old hellion played by a startling discovery named Brooklynn Kimberly Prince. Moonee is a force of nature, as imputent as she is irresistible. The poverty of her circumstances has also blessed her with an extraordinary imagination. The Magic Castle may be a bargain basement fantasy land, but through Moonee's eyes, it somehow comes alive as a kingdom of genuine enchantment.
"The Florida Project" is a remarkable evocation of children at play. The camera follows Moonee and her friends as they scramble up and down the stairs and in and out of rooms, getting underfoot and causing trouble. In one early scene, we see Moonee touring the neighborhood with her buddy, Scooty, played by Christopher Rivera, and a new girl named Jancey, played by Valeria Cotto, whom she introduces to one of their favorite hustles.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE FLORIDA PROJECT")
BROOKLYNN PRINCE: (As Moonee) And this is where we get free ice cream.
VALERIA COTTO: (As Jancey) Really?
PRINCE: (As Moonee) Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER RIVERA: (As Scooty) Yeah. Follow me.
PRINCE: (As Moonee) Could we have some money? Do we have enough? Excuse me. Excuse me, Miss. Could you give us some change, please? We need to buy ice cream.
RIVERA: (As Scooty) 'Cause we don't have any money. We just have five cents.
PRINCE: (As Moonee) Yeah, we just have five cents.
RIVERA: (As Scooty) And the doctor said we have asthma and we got to keep ice cream right away.
PRINCE: (As Moonee) Yeah, my doctor too.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) Guys.
PRINCE: (As Moonee) We're not lying.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) It's fine.
PRINCE: (As Moonee) Thank you very much.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) Here you go.
PRINCE: (As Moonee) Let's go. Come on.
CHANG: Moonee inherited her gift for wheedling money out of strangers from her mother, Halley, a 22-year-old played by another terrific newcomer named Bria Vinaite. Halley barely makes the rent each week, but when she and Moonee aren't playing and hanging out together, they too have a money making-scheme of sorts. They buy knockoff perfume bottles wholesale and then sell them to guests at nicer hotels nearby while a friend who works at the Waffle House down the road sneaks them free food out the back door.
Halley's green-streaked hair and heavy tattoos may invite your snap judgments, but what makes her such an unfit mother isn't her appearance but her attitude. She's as much of a child as Moonee is, and Vinaite plays her with jaw-jutting defiance and a rage that can flare up in an instant. Reflexively mean and spiteful, Halley is one of those lost souls who have long since decided that there's no point in being nice or gracious when the deck is so completely stacked against you.
That may explain why she saves most of her contempt for the person who keeps trying to help her, the motel's perpetually put-upon manager, Bobby. He's played by Willem Dafoe, one of the few recognizable faces in the cast. And he gives the kind of performance that makes you fall in love with an actor anew. Whether he's making repairs around the building, attending to a sudden power failure or protecting the unsupervised kids from a stranger on the premises, Bobby is as hardworking and long suffering as they come. But he can't hide his love for his tenants, even the ones like Halley and Moonee who make his life hell. Why else would he keep bailing them out?
Baker scored an indie breakthrough in 2015 with the superb Los Angeles-set comedy "Tangerine" in which he worked with two transgender actresses to create a compelling hybrid of truth and fiction. That movie's claim to fame was that it was shot on a high-definition iPhone camera. With "The Florida Project," which was photographed almost entirely on gorgeous 35 millimeter film by Alexis Zabe, Baker has taken his brand of lower-depth surrealism to new heights of formal sophistication without sacrificing a moment's authenticity.
For all its dreamlike interludes, its lushest day-glo colors and purple-gold sunsets, "The Florida Project" is ruthless in its lack of sentimentality. The story plays out with a bone-deep understanding of what poverty does to people, how few options it leaves them with. The beauty of the movie is that it sustains its unresolvable tension between realism and fantasy to the very end - or does it? I'll leave it to you to experience the jaw-dropping finale of "The Florida Project" for yourself. It's a magical moment, even as it reminds you that not everyone lives happily ever after.
DAVIES: Justin Chang is a film critic at The Los Angeles Times. On Monday's show, historian Anne Applebaum talks about the 1933 famine in Ukraine orchestrated by Joseph Stalin, a classic example of genocide. Applebaum is the author of the book "Red Famine: Stalin's War On Ukraine." She'll also talk about current Russian interference in elections. She helps run an election monitoring project at the London School of Economics. Hope you can join us.

Being able to purchase Bitcoin is the initial step to trading in it. Just like trading a stock, Bitcoin exchanges charge transaction fees, which range from 0 to 1%. In order to trade Bitcoin on an exchange, the user needs to have an account, and go through a series of steps to be verified. Remember that Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies are a completely digital currency, and there are no physical Bitcoins.
However, before plunging in with both feet, users should be aware of what to look for in choosing a Bitcoin exchange for their cryptocurrency transactions. This is analogous to the issues and potential pitfalls in making a choice of where to do your banking, or open an online brokerage account. Furthermore, bear in mind that unlike banks and stock trading, Bitcoin trading is largely unregulated by most countries, although this is changing as its popularity increases.
A good place to start is to look at the virtual coins which are supported by an exchange. With over 4,000 cryptocurrencies, and additional ones being added all the time, it is key to figure out which currencies you want to trade in, and then match the exchange that deals in those. For example, Ethereum mining has recently become more popular, but not all Bitcoin exchanges support this alternative cryptocurrency.
Language barriers
Next look at the country that is hosting the Bitcoin exchange. Some are in less regulated countries, and there may be additional problems if something goes awry. This can include time differences, international long distance costs, and language barriers. In general, it's preferable to find an exchange that speaks your language.
Additionally, pay close attention to the fees levied. While all these exchanges charge transaction fees – after all, they are businesses looking to make a profit – as the user, it is obviously best to find one with the lowest costs in order to maximize your own profits.
Also look for a secure trading platform, and a Bitcoin exchange which has robust security measures. After all, you wouldn't use a bank that didn't have a vault, and stored its money on the counter…
Desirable security features include two-factor authentication, SMS or email alerts, encrypted emails, and wallet monitoring. A smartphone app can also be very useful in terms of accessing and monitoring funds – but equally, poorly implemented software can represent a security risk.
Finally, look for an exchange which is doing a good volume of trading – in other words, one with a high number of trading pairs, and high liquidity.
Now that we know the features to look for in the best Bitcoin exchanges, let's move on to pick out our particular favorites.
The biggest exchange out there
Streamlined interface
Wide currency support
Insurance protection available
This is a US-based exchange which was founded in 2012, and it supports over 32 countries. Coinbase exchanges Bitcoin and the alternative cryptocurrencies of Ethereum and Litecoin, and it's the largest of the exchanges, claiming $20 billion (£15 billion) in currency exchanged. In 2014 Coinbase created GDAX, the Global Digital Asset Exchange which was developed for professionals with high volumes of trading.
The firm offers a mobile wallet, offline storage, and insurance protection for currency stored on its servers. Coinbase supports several fiat currencies: British Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Singapore Dollars.
The Coinbase exchange has a 1% flat fee for each purchase, while cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are done without any fees. A streamlined user interface which is ideal for novice traders – and fast trades – makes Coinbase a popular exchange with traders.
Regulated exchange from the Winklevoss twins
Low fees
Accepts ACH transfers
Interface isn't very novice-friendly
Gemini Exchange is another US-based outfit founded by the Winklevoss twins – the pair who sued Mark Zuckerberg over social networking, and were awarded $65 million (£48 million), which they put to use as venture capitalists. This exchange is based in New York, and is available in 45 US states, as well as the UK, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.
Gemini's only supported fiat currency is US dollars, and it only trades Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gemini does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees, and levies a low flat rate of 0.25% for trades, to both the buyer and the seller.
Another advantage of Gemini is that it's a New York state limited liability trust company, and is regulated by New York's Department of Financial Services. Close proximity to the Wall Street financial markets allows the company to easily provide a bridge from more traditional investments to newer cryptocurrency markets, for both individual and institutional investors.
Gemini is also notable in that it accepts ACH transfers for fast access to money for trades. A potential downside is that the interface is not particularly novice-friendly.
From the team that created MinerGate
Supports lots of cryptocurrencies
Competitive in terms of fees
Relative newcomer on the scene
Changelly is a cryptocurrency exchange with support for many more virtual currencies than most, including Monero, Dash, Bytecoin, and DigitalNote among others. If you are mining a less popular currency, chances are that Changelly can exchange it for you.
This exchange comes from the popular mining platform MinerGate which provides a merged mining pool across Windows, Mac, Linux and Android operating systems. While Changelly focuses on exchanges between different cryptocurrencies, users can also purchase cryptocurrency with US Dollars or Euros.
Note that this exchange has a shorter track record, as it only entered the market in 2016. Exchange fees are 0.5% on transactions.
An exchange that supports literally hundreds of cryptocurrencies
Supports a huge number of virtual currencies
Low trading fee
Sprawling and rather unwieldy website
Cryptopia was founded in 2014, aiming to be a comprehensive exchange that focuses on the user experience, with integration of additional services including a marketplace and wallet. It is based in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cryptopia is notable in that the first level of verification happens very quickly, and only requires an email address for initial verification.
While Cryptopia does not support fiat money trading, it does support a ridiculously large number of cryptocurrencies: over 400 to date, with more being added all the time. The trading fee is also a low 0.20% per transaction, which compares favorably with many competitors. The website is quite large and sprawling, meaning that new users might find their first experiences with the site a little daunting.

A millionaire Ukip donor has provoked anger by complaining he is "sick to death" of hearing about the Hillsborough disaster.
Arron Banks branded the 1989 stadium crush an "accident" that people are "milking" as he stormed into the row over false claims about it on Ukip leader Paul Nuttall's website.
The "accident" claim is false. Last year, after nearly three decades of campaigning, an inquest jury ruled the 96 victims died by unlawful killing not an accident.
Responses on Twitter included “dude! Wtf?”, “don't you dare” and “come on mate - thousands lost loved ones”.
Another Twitter user said: "It was a completely preventable disaster caused by gross neglience that resulted in 96 people unlawfully killed. Actually.”
The row began when Mirror columnist Brian Reade tweeted about the false claim that Ukip leader Paul Nuttall lost "close personal friends" in the disaster.
The claim was made in two separate quotes in his name, on his website - but a press officer says she was responsible.
Mr Banks told the columnist on Twitter: "I'm sick to death of hearing about it. It was a disaster and that's it, not some sort of cultural happening."
Mr Reade replied: "Sorry you're sick to death hearing about 96 deaths. And 'some sort of cultural happening' eh? There's UKIP in all its ugliness."
But Mr Banks pressed on, saying: "No milking a tragedy forever is sick."
Mr Reade replied: "Unlawful Killing verdicts after 27 years state cover-up equates to milking it eh? Oh dear. Sad sad little man."
To which Mr Banks added: "It was an awful accident at a football ground, that's it... Cover up or otherwise."

Conservative pundit Tim Montgomerie accused Mr Banks of "attacking those who suffered at Hillsborough".
Twitter user Jane Brownlee added: "That's the spirit. When in a hole, keep digging."
But Mr Banks stood by his remarks, saying: "If a policeman making a mistake is unlawful killing so be it, he made the wrong decision but it's still an accident."
WATERFORD, Ohio — Revenge is a dish best served at the buzzer.
The Southern boys basketball team — which dropped a 60-56 decision to Waterford on Dec. 22 in Racine — earned a measure of payback on Friday in the Harry Cooper Annex, as the Tornadoes hit a two-pointer as time expired to seal a 52-50 Tri-Valley Conference Hocking Division victory.
Southern (11-5, 9-3 TVC Hocking) trailed by six points, at 16-10, after the opening quarter, but surged for 21 points in the second period and went into the half with a 31-27 advantage.
The Wildcats (9-5, 9-3) got two points back in the third quarter, outscoring SHS by a 12-to-10 clip to make the SHS lead 41-39 with eight minutes to play.
Southern's lead was back to four points, at 50-46, with 1:17 to play, but Waterford tied the game at 50 with 11 seconds left. The Purple and Gold answered with a two-pointer at the buzzer, giving the guests a 52-50 victory for their fifth straight win.
The Tornadoes shot 20-of-51 (39.2 percent) from the floor, while the Wildcats shot 18-of-43 (41.9 percent). At the foul line Southern was 9-of-16 (56.3 percent) and Waterford was 10-of-19 (52.6 percent).
WHS outrebounded its guest by a 32-19 clip, while claiming a 13-to-10 assists advantage. Southern committed 11 turnovers, seven fewer than Waterford, while picking up a 7-to-5 edge in steals.
The Purple and Gold were led by senior Dylan Smith with 16 points on six field goals and a 4-of-6 mark from the charity stripe. SHS juniors Weston Thorla and Brayden Cunningham scored 12 points apiece, with Thorla making all three of Southern's triples.
Trey McNickle recorded eight points and five assists for the victors, while Austin Baker and Coltin Parker had two points apiece, with Baker grabbing a team-best seven rebounds. Smith also led the Tornado defense with a quartet of steals.
Travis Pottmeyer paced the Wildcats with 16 points and nine rebounds, followed by Bryce Hilverding with 10 points and four assists. Austin Pyatt and Noah Huffman both scored eight points in the setback, while Peyten Stephens and Russell Young marked four apiece. Pyatt led the WHS defense with two steals.
Southern and Waterford are now tied for second in the league standings, a game behind Trimble in the loss column.
After hosting Point Pleasant in non-league action on Saturday, the Tornadoes will get back to work in the TVC Hocking at home on Friday against Eastern.

"We've had a lot of kids watch this and ask their parents and ask at Q-and-A's, 'Is this real' or 'Did this happen 100 years ago?' And we have to say 'No, this is happening now.' I think it's really helpful when families go see it, for families to actually have this conversation with their kids."
Ellis wrote her children's novel based on the testimony of Afghan women she spoke with in refugee camps in Pakistan. She also wrote the initial draft of the screenplay for the film, while Canadian filmmaker Anita Doron wrote the final script.
"It's a film that shows the effects of war on ordinary people and we don't see that nearly enough, and I think it will help inform our decisions about whether or not we allow our governments to go to war," Ellis said from her home in Simcoe, Ont.
"Do we really want to keep doing this to other people, people who we would probably be friends with if we got to meet them in ordinary time? So I think the film is going to contribute to those kinds of discussions and that's wonderful, because the people who are seeing it now, the young people who are seeing it now, are maybe going to have that stuff imprinted in them — and when they become decision-makers, they might hesitate a little bit before killing people in other countries."
Irish animator Nora Twomey directed and acclaimed Canadian composers Jeff Danna and Mychael Danna did the score for the film, which is open in several cities in Canada and the U.S.
Rosen and his Aircraft Pictures partner Anthony Leo have been working on the project since 2009.
The other co-producing countries are Ireland and Luxembourg. Some of the post-production was done in Toronto.
Rosen said Jolie has been a big supporter of the film, helping with casting, giving guidance to Twomey and staging screenings in Los Angeles. Jolie, who has worked with Afghan refugees and schools, also attended the film's premieres in Los Angeles and Toronto.
Chaudry said she looks up to Jolie and counts her daughter, Zahara, as her "best friend."
"The Breadwinner" is nominated against "The Boss Baby," "Ferdinand," "Coco" and "Loving Vincent."
"We never made the film to be political or religious in any way. It comes from a universal story about family," said Rosen, who plans to attend the Golden Globes show.
"It's about a girl who just wants to get her father back and the strength of that girl, so we feel we don't want to shun anyone from watching it.... Laura Bush actually watched it with some of her staff in Texas and we think that's a positive statement — to say that this is a film that can be seen in red states, blue states. This is a film that every kid 10 and up can watch with their family so they can have that discussion."

A history of Cabbagetown outrage
A history of Cabbagetown outrage
The late Rob Ford liked to say that every crane dotting the city skyline represents 1,000 jobs. You might also say that every crane represents at least 100 residents ticked off at whatever new thing is rising in their neighbourhood. And while complaining about the next condo development is a citywide pastime, nobody does municipal indignation quite like Cabbagetown residents.
The most recent complaint comes from Toronto Star reader Randy Brown, who emailed the paper to complain about some “ugly signs” the city put up around Riverdale Park West as part of a pilot project. Cabbagetown locals have found lots of other targets for their ire. Here's a quick rundown of the past few years in supposed threats to the neighbourhood's “character.”
The Cabbagetown Restaurant
Residents complained that the Cabbagetown Restaurant on Parliament Street had become a haven for drug use and drunkenness, prompting a hearing before Ontario's Alcohol and Gaming Commission in 2007. The AGCO heard “ample proof that drug dealers and drug pushers” hung out at the restaurant. The operator of a nearby No Frills said he'd watched as a shoplifter walked to the restaurant's patio “where he was protected by patrons.” The case illustrated deep tensions within the neighbourhood, between people who depend on sub-$10 lunches and those who are perhaps more concerned with fixing up their million-dollar heritage homes. Victor Jiang, the restaurant's manager, attracted the support of lawyer Peter Rosenthal and the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty, but the business was ultimately stripped of its liquor license. There's now a Wing Machine at its old address.
The Beer Store
Last year, Cabbagetownsfolk objected to a proposed new condo tower at 227 Gerrard Street East using a well-worn argument: “It's too tall.” Developer RoseWater's plans for the site include a possible Beer Store—which, as Maclean's reported last month, some residents don't love. That's interesting, considering what's currently at the site: a Beer Store. Locals have said they don't want the new location to accept empties, which apparently leads to lines forming outside the current Beer Store before it opens. The project is before the Ontario Municipal Board. Steve Thompson of RoseWater tells us he believes the company has addressed the locals' concerns. The building proposal has been shortened by one storey to seven, he said. As for the Beer Store, he's not certain it will actually be a part of the final development.
The splash pad
In 2015, as the city built a new splash pad at the end of Wellesley Street, neighbours were in an uproar. Resident Steve Poulin said the new water feature would turn the park “into a hyperactive Disneyland,” and that the city's design seemed reminiscent of a “Las Vegas waterworks.” But most offensive to the locals was a blue umbrella, an apparent affront to the neighbourhood's heritage character. The city agreed to change the umbrella to green, but some neighbours were still worried. One resident was concerned the city might choose lime green, which she said was “not a heritage colour.”
The daycare
Earlier this year, Cabbagetown residents flooded a committee room at City Hall to speak out about a threat to their neighbourhood. Was it drug dealing? Gun violence? No, this was something much worse: a daycare. The would-be entrepreneurs who planned on opening a childcare facility in a long-vacant home clearly hadn't reckoned with the incandescent rage of neighbours with mortgages and a lot of free time. “It's an outrage,” resident Ken Mathieson told the Star. Pastel signage in the neighbourhood would be “truly distressing,” another said in a letter to the committee of adjustment. The proposal was rejected after members of the committee decided the proposed daycare would worsen neighbourhood traffic.
The bike-share station
In 2017, some residents calling themselves the Cabbagetown Heritage Conservation District Committee wrote a letter to then-councillor Pam McConnell to complain about the placement of a Bike Share station near the northwest edge of Riverdale Park West. The station was close to three heritage sites, they wrote, and in their view it was incompatible with the local “character, rhythm and overall setting.” The committee wanted the Bike Share station moved to the southwest corner of Carlton and Sumach Streets. A rep for bike sharing company Shift Transit says that the station was eventually relocated to the intersection's northeast corner, where we found it close to some new-looking bike rings.
Came home to this neighbourly note. Clutter is my son's hockey sticks & nets and 4 tiki lights #passiveaggressive. pic.twitter.com/vbHtQdZPRN — Roger Petersen (@rogerfpetersen) April 8, 2015
The CityNews anchor
It was a story you could only find on CityNews—because the passive-aggressive note was delivered to one of their journalists. After City anchor Roger Petersen moved into a Cabbagetown home, he received an anonymous handwritten note offering some suggestions on his place. Petersen might stash his basketball net in the laneway, the letter-writer suggested, and some offending Christmas lights—a mere “four Tiki lights,” Petersen noted—should be dropped off at Goodwill. Petersen also survived a raccoon attack. All he needs now is a flooded basement to complete the Toronto homeowner trifecta.

According to Previews, a classic British black & white wildlife comic called Marney the Fox is available again, now in a hardcover collection. We got this from Blimey, the Blog of British Comics: “Just to cover the basics; Marney the Fox appeared in Buster weekly from the issue dated 22nd June 1974 to 11th September 1976. This fictional story of a wandering fox cub was written by Scott Goodall and illustrated by John Stokes. The artwork was absolutely superb and many consider it to be amongst Stokes' best work. (The artist himself regards it as some of his best too.) One thing that made Marney the Fox exceptional is that, unlike most other Buster adventure strips, it played up the emotional content.” The new collection is available now from Rebellion/2000AD.

Mumbai: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit in Maharashtra is prepared for mid-term polls, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has said. Fadnavis made the remarks in reference to reports speculating mid-term polls in the state against the backdrop of farmers' stir for loan waiver in view of the agrarian crisis.
The Fadnavis government had agreed to the long-standing demand of farmers and announced a loan waiver for them last Sunday. “Some people said (when the agitation was on) that they will bring the government down, they will withdraw support. I said we are ready for mid-term polls. “If someone wants to impel us to go for mid-term polls, I am confident we will be able to form government again,” Fadnavis told reporters here without naming any party.
Buoyed by the BJP's success in Maharashtra local bodies' polls, held recently, Fadnavis exuded confidence that people of the state were with the saffron party notwithstanding various agitations in the state.
“That success was unprecedented. No other party achieved such success. The Congress-NCP couldn't attend the success even during their hay days. So, people believe in the government,” he said. Talking to a Marathi news channel recently, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut had suggested that his party, a BJP ally in the state government, would withdraw support if the loan waiver was not announced.

In 'The New Face Of America,' Journalist Alex Wagner Saw Herself
Enlarge this image toggle caption Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images
In 1993, Alex Wagner saw a familiar face on the cover of Time magazine: It was a computer-generated picture of a multiethnic woman who reminded her of ... herself.
Wagner's father is white and from the Midwest; her mother is from what was then Burma. And after reading the Time story on "The New Face of America," Wagner, then a teenager, decided to embrace her identity as a "futureface."
"I liken it to sort of thinking you were a pigeon and then finding out you were a toucan," says Wagner, now a journalist. "It was like this thing that no one else had, this 'futureface.' But as I got older, I felt the weightlessness of that. And I wanted to know what grounded me."
Wagner was filled with questions about where she belonged, which family stories were myths and which stories were left untold. Her new book, Futureface, is her attempt to find answers about her ancestry.
"In the initial stages, I sort of started talking to family members, and they would tell me these stories," Wagner says. "And inevitably — we all find this — there were snags in those stories, little kind of asides that didn't make sense. And I pulled them, and that's really what the book is about."

On her mother's and grandmother's memories of home
Burma — and let me be clear, it's also known as Myanmar — and the reason a lot of Burmese and Burmese exiles call it Burma: It's a form of political resistance to the ruling military junta.
The stories of Burma were always redolent with the scent of frangipani blossoms, and, you know, these incredibly gauzy memories about life in the aftermath of British colonialism, which weren't ... political stories. But they were stories about this just incredibly romantic way of life. My grandmother would talk about having bananas at teatime and carrying palm fronds when the monsoon rains came, and I accepted all of those stories because they were like poetry. But they weren't grounded in any particular reality, and they didn't answer the fundamental question, which was, "If life in Burma was so good, why did we leave?"
On fact-checking her family's history
As I did the research talking to people in my family — namely my grandmother, who had the greatest wealth of stories — I also started cross-referencing some of the things she was telling me about with historical documents, which is not what we often do in the realm of family histories. And then, of course, I traveled to Burma. I went to the Burmese archives, which was a comedic endeavor if ever there was one. There was nothing, really — not much of an archive.
But what I did discover is that some of these sort of petty bigotries that were made manifest in family stories tied back to a very violent and virulent strain of Burmese nationalism that I had never even considered. ... In many ways, the Burmese upper class like my grandmother turned a blind eye to Indian massacres that happened in Burma ... at the time my family lived there.

On her father's side of the family and the "White Immigrant Origin Story"
The White Immigrant Origin Story is effectively the American origin story, which is that, "We immigrants from Western Europe left the Old World, we started anew, and because of our hard work and divine providence, we made it in America." ...
For the most part, the White Immigrant Origin Story either glosses over huge parts of reality and history — or is just a lie. And in the case of my grandfather, what we knew about him was built on falsehoods. And as I went back to Luxembourg and did intense genealogical detective work to find out who this person was, I realized that he bore no resemblance to the person we thought he was. And that was important because the heroism that is a fundamental part of the White Immigrant Origin Story, I think, can be exclusionary. And what I'm trying to do in this book, I think, is to find a more inclusive narrative when we talk about America.
On finding her own community
I think we do a lot of work in this day and age focusing on the future and on the past. And we hope that somehow, we'll find something in both places. But what I realized through all of this digging through, the place where you can really find yourself is, of course, right here, and that we don't invest enough in the present. When we think of community, we think of some sort of nebulous, faraway group of people rather than the men and the women who touch our daily lives. And I realized that my people basically had been with me all along. ...
And I think as simple as that is, it's changed my worldview. It's changed the way I think of every single day. I began this book really feeling lonely and really plumbing the depths of my existential despair, but I came out of it feeling like I was part of a fabric that was pretty tightly woven.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that India's growth story will get speed only when there is all round development of Northeast and its people.
Speaking at the Advantage Assam-Global Investors Summit in Guwahati Modi said, “Assam is ranked first among the North Eastern States in the Ease of Doing Business report. With present leadership of the state government, Assam is going to further improve its current position to emerge as one of the most sought after states for investment”.
The state has identified a number of focus sectors, including agriculture and food processing, organic cultivation and bamboo, handloom, textile and handicrafts, inland water transport, port township and river front development and logistics.
“We are restructuring the ‘National Bamboo mission' with the amount of Rs 1300 crore. This will benefit people of North East, especially the farmers of this region,” Modi added.
The 'Advantage Assam: Global Investors Summit 2018', inaugurated by the PM, aims at highlighting Assam's geostrategic advantages and core competencies in different sectors along with the policy initiatives taken by the state government.
Modi said the tagline of the meet - `Advantage Assam: India`s expressway to ASEAN` - is very appropriate and not just a statement but it is a "comprehensive vision".
Apart from the prime minister, several Union ministers including Nitin Gadkari, Suresh Prabhu, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Smriti Irani, Dharmendra Pradhan, Jitendra Singh, Kiren Rijiju and Industrialists like Mukesh Ambani and Ratan Tata are also to attending the summit.
On an early winter evening in 1978, I and Lynn Gossett, one of the first friends I made at Ohio University, trudged through the weather to Memorial Auditorium to hear a speaker invited by the university to discuss matters of then-current importance.
Both of us little realized as we entered the building that we would meet the man of the hour the same night, and while said meeting was more of a casual hobnob of little consequence in anyone's life, I never forgot it. And that was because this individual was so much a part of U.S. history and its more shadowy efforts on the world stage.
The man was William Egan Colby, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who was still hot copy because his 1976 departure from the job, coming after a year of Congressional probes that pierced the culture of secrecy surrounding the agency, was still shrouded in controversy. In Athens almost two years to the day after he was replaced as CIA chief by George H.W. Bush, Colby would no doubt discuss his experiences in espionage that began as an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) operative in World War II.
I was interested in that stuff at the time, although to be truthful I didn't know a great deal about it all, including the more recent events that had led to Colby's dismissal in the final year of the Ford administration. But I did know that even under a new president and director, the CIA was still a topic of interest. As I recall, Colby's speech to the university crowd was respectful and thought-provoking about the role of intelligence in shaping policy. If he was at all bitter over his treatment after serving his country for three decades, you wouldn't know it, because he was the kind of patriot who preferred discussing the failings of the system in a calm and rational manner, which in the coming years he became known for doing.
It occurred to me there may be a reception for Colby in the upper level of Memorial Auditorium following his talk, so Lynn and I hustled upstairs and hovered in the hallway near an open door to a room where OU faculty, administrators and friends would greet the speaker. We were actually quite alone when from the other end of the hallway came Colby, unaccompanied and perhaps a bit unsure of where he was supposed to be. He had retrieved his overcoat, and for all the world resembled a bespectacled attorney (which was his profession at the time) or teacher with a pleasant demeanor who approached the only souls around, a pair of non-threatening college students, offering a humorous remark about being either too early or too late.
With the ice broken, we shook hands and asked Colby if he was planning a book about his experiences. He replied in the affirmative (“Honorable Men: My Life in the CIA” appeared a few months later) and chatted a bit more with us when a university staffer came to collect him for the reception.
It took a little while to sink in with us that we'd been speaking with a man who held so much responsibility during the Cold War that had been tempered some by the detente that Henry Kissinger, who emerged as one of Colby's White House opponents during his CIA directorship, engineered during the '70s.
What struck us was Colby's openness as a person and participant in some of the major events of the time. This transparency ultimately led to his downfall at the CIA as he advocated reformation of the agency's cloak-and-dagger image and willingness to speak with Congress about its failings. Yet he also seemed unaffected by it all and certainly not cowed by recent experiences, even serene in his belief he was right. I soon wrote an account of Colby's visit for a one-off student-produced political journal, but its mastermind wasn't impressed by my viewpoint and reduced the piece to a headline and paragraph before it saw print.
Fast forward several months to summer break back in New York State. With a night off from my seasonal job, I hung out at home with an old high school friend, Peter Masella. As we went into the living room, we found my father, as was his habit, watching Merv Griffin's syndicated talk/variety show on local television (it led into the 10 p.m. news, always Dad's real objective when it came to TV). I glanced at the screen and there was Colby, responding to the host's questions and plugging his book. I alerted Peter to the fact, and his response, marinaded in that twisted sense of humor we both enjoyed, was thus: “Just think, Kevin. That's the man, who only a few years ago, could have ordered your death!”
We chuckled at the absurdity of our government wanting to eliminate me, a know-nothing gentleman and scholar working the graveyard shift at Howard Johnson's, but it underscored the public perception of the CIA's misdeeds that came to light during the rocky 2-1/2 years Colby served as its director.
While I remembered our meeting, I didn't think much about Colby again until late April 1996, when reports surfaced that, at 76, he'd gone missing while canoeing alone near Rock Point, Md., in a tributary of the Potomac River. His body was found a week later, with his passing ruled accidental. Almost immediately, conspiracy theorists had him pegged as a victim of foul play connected to his lengthy past with the CIA, which included a 12-years stint in South Vietnam. It was, however, revealed he suffered from heart disease, a suggested cause of death which satisfied all but the diehards.
In 2011, Colby's son Carl released the documentary “The Man Nobody Knew,” a feature-length study of his father and his times in which Carl, trying to resolve some obvious resentment toward the man over family issues, suggested that he committed suicide, guilt-ridden over his career with the CIA and what it brought to reality. I can't speak to that belief, since a son should know his father and what he was like. But I do believe William Colby, convinced he was right in his position, never wavered from that stance. Or was particularly doubtful about his actions.
People will disagree with me, I'm sure. But that determination was also a hallmark of the generation of which he was a part that fought for a better world, one to be enjoyed by the likes of you and me.

A garage boss who sold Class A drug s to afford a boob job for his beautician wife has been ordered to pay back over £100,000.
Ashley Wilkin, 29, claimed he started peddling crack and cocaine after running up a £40,000 debt with a loan shark.
A court heard the mechanic borrowed £25,000 to fund his lavish wedding to wife Bailey, but did not tell her about the loan “because she would hit the roof.”
Wilkin, of Erdington,Birmingham, also splashed out £10,000 on a boob job and tummy tuck for his wife, purchased a Mercedes and a Harrods store card.
He pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply and was jailed for three years and nine months at Birmingham Crown Court in April.
Wilkin has been now been ordered to pay back a total of £109,000 following a Proceeds of Crime hearing at the same court.
Today West Midlands Police said they had seized £2million of ill-gotten gains in less than a year.
Detective Sergeant Paddy Gillece, from Force CID economic crime unit, said: “Just because a criminal has been sentenced, it does not mean it's the end of our investigation.
“We will always seek to prevent criminals benefitting from ill-gotten gains and look to claw back their ‘dirty money' through the courts.
“By taking away the profits we can break the cycle of criminal behaviour and those who don't pay back the money can face extra time behind bars.
“The money we have recovered already should serve as a stark reminder that crime doesn't pay.”
Wilkin had said he was threatened with a gun when he was unable to keep up with loan shark payments and turned to drug dealing as a last resort.
But his story was rejected by a judge who found the dad-of-two became a street dealer in order to fund a lavish lifestyle.
Wilkin, co-owner of Kingsbury Auto Repairs in Birmingham, had also been funding his lifestyle unbeknownst to his family who believed his cash came from his business.
But his secret trade was unravelled when he was pulled over for a minor traffic offence on June 4.
Police searched his vehicle believing his window tints to be illegal and spotting three mobile phones in his car.
They uncovered 28.2g of cocaine and 2.3g of crack concealed in a ‘man bag' as well as over £2,000 in cash.
When his home at Erdington, Birmingham was searched a compressed blog of cocaine weighing 153g was found along with a 3.59g of the drug.
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (WATE) – Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin will not call plays for Alabama in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.
Instead, Kiffin will head to Florida Atlantic University early to assume coaching duties. Head coach Nick Saban said Steve Sarkisian will assume Kiffin's duties immediately.
“We appreciate all that Lane has done for our football program over the last three years,” said Saban. “We sat down following the Washington game and talked about the time demands of managing both jobs and we recognized that it is best for our players and for Lane, that we allow him to turn his full attention to his new head coaching role at FAU.”
“This wasn't an easy decision and we appreciate the way Lane handled this in terms of doing what is best for our team. At the end of the day, both of us wanted to put our players in the best position to be successful. Obviously, we are in a unique situation here where we have our next offensive coordinator already on staff. We have full confidence that Sark will step in right away and make this a smooth transition.”
Kiffin was hired as the head coach at Florida Atlantic on December 12, but chose to stay on with Alabama through the playoff.
“After going through these last couple of weeks, trying to serve the best interests of two universities as an offensive coordinator and a head coach, it became apparent that both programs would be better served by me giving all my time and efforts to being the head coach at FAU. After meeting with Coach Saban during preparations last night and this morning, we mutually decided that it was in everyone's best interests for the players and the program for Coach Sarkisian to take over all responsibilities as offensive coordinator for the championship game. This was a very difficult decision, but it's a decision made in the best interests of the program. I look forward to helping Alabama win another championship, and would like to thank Coach Saban, the staff, and all the players and fans for the past three years at UA for an unforgettable time and championship run. Roll Tide!” -Lane Kiffin
After one season, Kiffin left Tennessee during the 2010 recruiting season to accept the head coaching job at the University of South California. He was dismissed from the University of South California in 2013 after four seasons with the team. In 2014, Kiffin accepted the offensive coordinator position for Alabama after Michigan hired Doug Nussmeier.
Spotify Redesigns Its Free Tier, With Hopes Of Grabbing Even More Users
Enlarge this image toggle caption Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Spotify Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Spotify
This morning in New York City, the streaming giant Spotify — which began publicly trading earlier this month and has a current valuation of $28 billion — held a press conference to announce changes to the free version of its mobile app for both iOS and Android. The company hopes that these new features, which will be rolled out in the weeks ahead, will create a sizable increase in its user numbers globally.
The company says that these changes to music fans' experience on its mobile, ad-supported app — which include 15 personalized "music discovery" playlists in which listeners can hear full songs on-demand as well as an optional "data saver" function, which reduces the amount of mobile data the app uses by up to 75 percent — will entice even more users to its free tier. Spotify's in-house playlists, such as Rap Caviar and Viva Latino, are important drivers of exposure (and by extension, revenue) for record labels and artists.
Some 90 million people currently use the free tier worldwide, while 71 million pay for its subscription service. As NPR has previously reported, 90 percent of the company's revenues come from subscriptions, not free listening.
Spotify argues that a large uptick in free-tier users could result in big gains for content creators and rights holders — mostly in terms of potential exposure to new fans. Even so, referring to the recorded music industry's glory days of peak sales, Gustav Söderström, Spotify's chief research and development officer, promised, "This will make the 1990s look like a practice run."
Overall, streaming is continuing to grow quickly: according to the 2017 International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) report, which was issued today, streaming revenue grew 41 percent last year, while download revenues declined by 20.5 percent and physical revenues went down 5 percent.
During Spotify's investor-day presentation last month, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek stated that his company was working on launching its platform in some of the world's most populous markets, including India, China and across Africa. The reduced data load that Spotify promised today has the potential to make its streaming services far more friendly to users in those countries.
With these moves, Spotify is continuing to employ the classic tech-company strategy of scale-before-profit in the hopes of holding onto its first place in the music streaming marketplace, while Apple Music has amassed its 38 million subscribers to its service in just less than three years.
During a Q&A session with journalists that followed the presentation, Spotify executives were asked whether or not, with these changes to its mobile offerings and its emphasis on its free, ad-supported tier worldwide, the company would readdress or increase its payments to artists and labels. The answer was no.
Spotify is positioning its free service as a competitor to terrestrial radio worldwide, not to mention more direct competitors such as Apple Music, and that Spotify pays more to artists and rights holders than terrestrial commercial radio does. Söderström noted that radio was once the main vehicle for artist promotion, and that music fans then turned to record stores to buy music. Spotify's global head of creator services, Troy Carter (who formerly managed Lady Gaga and continues to manage Meghan Trainor, Kamasi Washington and Charlie Puth through his company Atom Factory), said that unlike the one-time profit that comes with selling a physical disc or vinyl album, streaming provides an ongoing source of revenue for artists. But, he acknowledged that with its much lower payout rates, streaming is a "paradigm shift" for artists. "We're focusing on scale," Carter added. "The bigger we get, the more we pay out."
ODDBALL, the penguin saving dog that became the subject of a heart-warming movie, has passed away at the ripe old age of 105 in human years.
The Maremma dog died last week after 15 years on the planet.
Shane Jacobsen, who starred as Allan 'Swampy' Marsh, in Oddball, joined others in marking the dog's passing.
"The film Oddball was a great Australian story, but the applause truly belongs to that wonderful dog Oddball," Mr Jacobson said.
"The animal kingdom has lost one of its gentle bodyguards. RIP Oddball."
Mr Jacobson bought his own Maremma after filming Oddball.
The story of Oddball put Warrnambool on the international map after tugging at heartstrings of moviegoers.
A number of Qantas passengers on international flights to Australia changed their travel plans to visit Warrnambool and the home of the pioneering Maremma, The Standard reported.
The town experienced 43 media visits in the year leading up to the movie.
Richard Keddie, the producer of Oddball, expressed his sadness at the passing of the inspirational dog.
"It's incredibly sad," Mr Keddie said.
"She and Swampy are heroes. Oddball is such an inspiration for what's possible.
"Oddball sort of changed the world a little bit."
Mr Keddie said he supported the idea of a statue to be erected in Oddball's honour.
Warrnambool mayor Kylie Gaston told The Standard a statue of Oddball opposite Middle Island would be a fitting tribute to the late canine.
"I'm aware there are quite a few people who think it would be a good idea to have some sort of sculpture, perhaps across from the island and perhaps this is the impetus for that," Councillor Gaston said.

Pregnant Ferne McCann has been soaking up some late Summer sun during a break in Majorca.
The 27-year-old reality star is blooming beautifully as she prepares to welcome her first ever child.
Stripping down to a shimmering green bikini, the TOWIE star looked peaceful as she relaxed in her hotel.
Ferne took a seat on a sun lounger as she lapped up some heat.

She posed around the poolside, looking content and confident - with her baby bump on full display.
And stepping to the edge of the pool, the star slipped her legs into the water to cool off.
Ferne announced her pregnancy back in April.
The star is set to have an Autumn baby as she previously told OK! magazine: "I'm due mid to late November."

She is also convinced she knows the gender of her child, despite vowing not to have the sex revealed before she gives birth.
“I'm not finding out… [but] I'm adamant I'm having a boy. I read up online about all the symptoms,” she told OK! earlier this year.
The star has also vowed to be a single parent after the father of her baby, Arthur Collins , was arrested on suspicion of an acid attack in April.
One reason that has weighed on sentiment in recent months has been the pressure on marketing margins. Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint
Investors don't seem to see the value in state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) acquiring a sizeable stake in gas transportation company GAIL (India) Ltd. On Monday, OMC shares fell by 3-4% on a day when the broad market slipped by 0.8%. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC).
News reports indicate that BPCL and IOC may acquire the government's equity holding in GAIL, by buying around a 26% stake each. That could see an outflow of around Rs19,500 crore for each OMC at current prices.
While the move is said to be part of the government's decision to create integrated energy companies, it's not clear how this will do that.
Both businesses are very different. OMCs run refineries and retail fuel, while GAIL transports gas through its pipelines and maintains transport infrastructure. What the move will certainly do is help the government add to its disinvestment kitty from the sale proceeds.
Some worry about the lack of synergies in such a deal and the extent to which it will stretch the balance sheets of BPCL and IOC. At the end of fiscal year 2017, IOC's and BPCL's total consolidated borrowings stood at Rs58,800 crore and Rs31,473 crore, translating into a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.57 and 0.96, respectively.
“HPCL too succumbed under the pressure, as people take a view on OMCs as a pack,” said an analyst, requesting anonymity.
To be sure, stocks of these companies have underperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past three months. OMCs trade at eight-nine times their respective estimated earnings for the next fiscal year (FY19), based on Bloomberg data. That may seem undemanding but it is not reason enough for investors to become excited.
One reason that has weighed on sentiment in recent months has been the pressure on marketing margins. The measure had dropped to a low of about Re1 a litre during the December quarter, thanks to a lack of increases in domestic retail prices even as global crude oil prices rose much faster during the period. Sure, marketing margins have shown a remarkable recovery since then. Still, as we step into the next fiscal year, a major worry is how marketing margins will shape up considering the impending state elections.
There is, however, a glimmer of hope. According to Antique Stock Broking Ltd, crude oil prices may remain sideways, given rising US shale oil production and weaker global demand growth expectations. That means OMCs will not need a significant price revision to maintain marketing margins at the current level of about Rs3.5 a litre, pointed out Antique Stock Broking. They can then comfortably tide over the election season when price increases are less likely. Investors would do well to watch how this actually plays out.
Meanwhile, from a near-term perspective, expectations from the March quarter earnings are upbeat, helped by improvement in marketing margins. Refining margins too have been better lately, which should reflect positively on the numbers. What's more, some analysts expect OMCs to make inventory gains as well. But if news about the GAIL stake purchase proves to be true, it can upset investor calculations.

Roundtable Discussion: The Nunes Memo
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to continue our discussion of the Nunes memo in the Barbershop. That's where we gather a diverse group to talk over the news of the week. So joining us for a shapeup today are Bridget Johnson. She's Washington bureau chief and managing editor of Homeland Security Today for PJ Media. That's a conservative online publication. She's here with me in our Washington, D.C., studios once again. Good to have you back, Bridget.
BRIDGET JOHNSON: Good to be back.
MARTIN: From San Diego, We're joined by Ruben Navarrette. He's a syndicated columnist for The Washington Post Writers Group and an education reform fellow at the George W. Bush Institute. He's with us via Skype. Hi, Ruben, good to have you back.
RUBEN NAVARRETTE: Michel, great to be back with you.
MARTIN: And last but certainly not least, Paul Butler, law professor at Georgetown University and a former federal prosecutor. He's with us from our bureau in New York. Hi, Paul. Good to see you as well.
PAUL BUTLER: Hey, Michel, what's up? Go Eagles. Woof, woof, woof.
MARTIN: OK. Well, we will get to that, I hope. Now, we already spent the first part of the program talking about this Nunes memo, but just to recap for those who may not have been with us, this is a document written by staffers for California Congressman Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, Republican. It argues that the FBI used a flawed process to get a warrant to undertake surveillance of members of the Trump campaign, both before and after the 2016 election.
So there was - all this week, there was this buildup of, will they or won't they release it? The FBI director, who I may add was appointed by President Trump, asked the White House not to, but yesterday, it was. So now that we've had a day to digest it, I wanted to ask you. Bridget, I'll start with you. This is your beat. So did we learn anything? What's the importance of this?
JOHNSON: I mean, I kind of feel like what Comey tweeted about - that's it? You know, it was a lot of buildups. And the the memo itself had some little, you know, some fallacies in it too. You know, Comey, for example, did not call the entire dossier salacious. He was just referring to parts of it. The dossier did not mention other evidence on Carter Page. And if you're getting, you know, three FISA warrants, you've got some other evidence going on. And also, the intelligence community is also saying this is a supplemental dossier. And, you know, raw intelligence that came across in the Steele dossier also, that's not submitted directly to the FISA court. You know, they're going to go through it. They're going to, you know, clean it up and get what they need. And former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has already said some of it has been verified and some of the stuff in the dossier has not either been verified or discounted.
NAVARRETTE: So take it all together. Does this mean anything or does it not mean anything?
JOHNSON: I mean, it helps Republicans run interference a little bit on the Mueller investigation as far as, you know, shoring up the base. You know, there they were pretty you know on fire and, you know, defending President Trump, and he of course is running with it on Twitter. Of course not all GOPs are on board, as we saw with Senator John McCain saying stop working for Putin. But, you know, whatever kind of distracts Trump actually works for Robert Mueller on time. You know, if Trump gets going on the national anthem in the NFL for about a week, that's a week where he's not thinking about firing Bob Mueller and, you know, that investigation can go on unimpeded.
MARTIN: That's an interesting idea. So, Ruben, I'm interested in what you think about this because you're not, you know, here in the swamp, as it were, you know, with us. How does this strike you? Ruben? Did we lose him? All right. Then let me go to Paul. Let me go to Paul Butler and say...
NAVARRETTE: I'm still here.
MARTIN: Your still here, OK. So, you're thinking about it. OK, so tell me, what do you think?
BUTLER: Wake up.
NAVARRETTE: It's problematic. It's not really, you know, as definitive. It doesn't do as much as Donald Trump says. It does not end the Russia investigation. It does not vindicate him. But it's not quite the nothingburger the Democrats are trying to portray. I was troubled by, for instance, the fact that if you're an investigator and you talk to a reporter that you can then turn around in a circle and go back and include what the reporter may have put out in the story in a formal FISA request. I didn't realize you could do that. I thought that was cheating. There does seem to be some cutting of corners here that's troubling in terms of how the folks at Justice, and particularly Rod Rosenstein, got to where he wanted to go. I think he cut some corners that ultimately may be problematic for him.
MARTIN: Paul Butler, curious to know your thoughts as a former federal prosecutor. And I'm also interested in your thoughts because, you know, it wasn't so long ago that progressives were mainly the people who were criticizing the FBI and also Democrats who were angry at the role that they believed that the former FBI director, James Comey, played in damaging Hillary Clinton's electoral prospects by reopening or at least publicly saying that he was reopening an investigation into her email. So what are your thoughts on this?
BUTLER: So basically, we have a grand conspiracy to obstruct justice. And Congressman Nunes' role was to put this memo out, which is supposed to make Rod Rosenstein look bad. That gives Trump a pretext to fire Rosenstein and put his own stooge in place to oversee the investigation and maybe fire Mueller or limit his authority. The problem is Trump's partisans are so inept, they can't even obstruct justice right.
The memo actually reads like a primer about how many hurdles the FBI has to go through to get a warrant to spy on an American citizen. And that structure is in place, Michel, because the FBI has this long sordid history of spying on Americans, including civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, people in the Black Panther Party. But the bureau learned from that. When James Comey was the FBI director, he required rookies to go visit the Martin Luther King Memorial. So the FBI was doing much better on these issues but we know what happened to James Comey, right?
MARTIN: Well, so what do you think this means at the end of the day? I mean, what do you think the result of this - and I just can't help but - forgive me, I have to - this - I can't help myself. I have to read this headline from a satire column - a satire column, I do want to emphasize this - from the New Yorker called "The Borowitz Report." It says, former hippies put into horrible position of rooting for FBI.
BUTLER: I don't know if I'm a hippie but I'm, you know, in this situation, I think that the FBI actually did what folks are supposed to do which is to learn from history and do better. The American law enforcement community learned that when investigations are politically driven, it's not a good look. And I think folks learned that until Mr. Trump came along and he thinks that - like there's a Trump hotel in Trump Tower, there's a Trump FBI and a Trump Department of Justice. And that's just not the way it works.
MARTIN: Well, Bridget Johnson, I have to ask you about this because the Republican Party has typically seen itself and has campaigned as the party of law and order. And I cannot help but note that during the State of the Union, the president made a big point of, you know, acknowledging and thanking members of various agencies except for the FBI. So I'm curious about this. And I'm also curious about the people you talked to on the Hill, particularly, you know, your sources as it were. What did they think of all this?
JOHNSON: I mean, yeah, it's an awkward position as far as supporting law enforcement. You know, you think that, you know, Republicans are just trying to run interference for Trump. But, you know, we also don't know how deep the Russia estimation runs within the party that drove the Trump campaign. You know, after all, you know, Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, was at the RNC at a sidelines event. You know, there are a lot of questions hanging out there.
But I think that, you know, first of all, lawmakers just renewed FISA with nary a debate. So, you know, if they really wanted to get into this, they had an opportunity to do that. And also what's being lost here is that, you know, say someone goes - breaks into a gallery, steals a priceless painting and the sole witness who led police to the thief and the painting has a checkered personal past. It doesn't negate the fact that a crime happened that the person who stole the painting is guilty of doing it. So I think that this strategy that they're doing of trying to discredit people who are connected to sort of lateral investigations on this is - kind of, you know, not very good strategy of trying to say, well, it doesn't matter if you commit a crime.
MARTIN: Ruben, what do you think about that?
NAVARRETTE: So I don't think the Trump administration has to work too hard to discredit some of the folks at the FBI. They're doing a great job all by themselves. At the top of the list is Jim Comey, who I'd remind you either cost Hillary Clinton the election if you listen to Hillary Clinton or, had she won, he would have been fired anyway because he almost cost her the election in that case.
He tried to play politics with the election. And I think what was interesting was there were a lot of folks who, until he was fired by Trump and became a martyr, there were a lot of folks on the left who were incensed at Comey, hated Comey because of the stunt he pulled. How dare you announce the investigation is reopened so close to the election. You're costing her the election.
MARTIN: In fact, when he spoke at Howard University last year - he was asked to give a lecture - he was heartily booed by the students there for precisely that reason. So I guess just very briefly, Ruben, if you would, what effect do you think all of this is having, particularly given your perspective being, you know, where you are not in the day-to-day here? Is this having any effect? Do people you talk to - are they paying attention?
NAVARRETTE: Yeah. I think they're paying attention but to both dramas, both the Trump-Russia drama which he would like to go away - it's not. Going away - and also just how free and loose the folks at the FBI and DOJ have been with the FISA court. I think that's not going away either. So both stories continue on.
MARTIN: OK. You know I can't let you go without asking. OK, I have to ask. OK, Ruben, Eagles-Patriots?
NAVARRETTE: Yeah. Eagles all the way. Oh, God, I hope so.
MARTIN: OK. Paul, Eagles-Patriots?
BUTLER: Eagles. In the words of Fat Joe, nothing can stop us, we're all the way up.
MARTIN: I think something can stop them but I'm just asking. I'm just reporting here. Bridget, what do you say?
JOHNSON: The non-Tom Brady team is the one I'm voting for.
MARTIN: Oh, OK. See, that's what's up. Look. I promised a diverse panel, but I didn't check for diversity on the Super Bowl picks. Well, thank you all so much. That was Bridget Johnson, Ruben Navarrette, Paul Butler. Thank you all so much for speaking with us. And, you know, we'll check back next week and see if your hopes and dreams were realized. And there's always wings if they weren't. OK.
NAVARRETTE: Thanks a lot. Thanks.
JOHNSON: Thanks, Michel.
BUTLER: Woof, woof, woof.

The house that Larry built. Oracle is the creation of one of the IT industry's most colourful characters, Larry Ellison
Oracle is the world's second largest software provider after Microsoft, but how did a provider of relational database software manage to reach such an achievement?
Well Oracle began life like many of the IT giants today in the 1970s, or 1977 to be precise. It was co-founded by Larry Ellison alongside Bob Miner, Ed Oates and Bruce Scott.
Ellison remained in charge of Oracle for many decades, until quite recently (2014) when he stepped sideways to the chairman position, and appointed two CEOs to lead the firm.
Early Days
Oracle itself was initially known as Software Development Laboratories (SDL), before changing its name to Relational Software Inc in 1978, and then Oracle Systems Corp in 1982, and finally Oracle Corp in 1995.
This name change to Oracle was taken in the early 1980s to align the company more closely with its flagship product – the Oracle Database. It should be noted that ‘Project Oracle' was a database project the firm was working on for none other than the US CIA.
Nowadays, it has a lot more offerings in its extensively product portfolio.
Right from the creation of SDL, Ellison had been heavily inspired by the 1970 paper written by Edgar (Tedd) F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) and the Oracle database became commercially available for sale in 1979.
Oracle was among a number of companies offering relational database management systems, most of these have either disappeared or have been acquired by other firms. But Oracle succeeded where others did not, thanks to a number of factors.
Firstly, its early success was down to the fact that it used the C programming language to implement its products, which made the porting of its product suite to multiple operating systems (most of which support C) and platforms (mainframes, minicomputers, PCs etc) relatively straight forward.
Another way Oracle succeeded was the fact that it would often charge its customers an annual fee to use its products. This ensured the money kept flowing in. But Oracle also succeeded as well because it was highly aggressive as a company. It grew at breakneck speed and expanded widely into many countries around the world.
Indeed, perhaps most significantly Oracle didn't take any prisoners when it came to acquisitions. Oracle became something of a serial acquirer in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and today Oracle has more than 430,000 customers and is present in 175 countries.
For the record, Oracle now has more than 138,000 employees, and in 2017 its annual revenues was in excess of $37 billion.
Larry Ellison
Yet some would argue that one of the main reasons that Oracle became such a software powerhouse was down to one man, namely Larry Ellison.
Ellison is perhaps one of the IT industry's most colourful characters, despite the fact he started life in very modest circumstances. He is now hugely wealthy (ranked 17th in the world with a $60 billion fortune) and his parties are legendary.
He even purchased an airline in 2012 (Island Air) simply because it serviced an island he owned (Ellison owns 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai).
Ellison has appeared in the Marvel superhero movie Iron Man 2, and is hugely successfully in the yachting sphere with his Oracle Team USA.
Ellison is also an adrenaline junkie at heart, and has suffered numerous injuries as a result of his participation in extreme sports. He is also a keen pilot and owns two military jets, and there are rumours that he once flew a fighter jet under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, although that it almost impossible to confirm.
Ellison has been married and divorced four times, and when he married his fourth wife, romance novelist Melanie Craft, his good friend Steve Jobs served as wedding photographer.
Oracle Missteps
But that is not to say there haven't been downsides for Ellison and Oracle. Both Oracle and Ellison nearly went bankrupt in the early 1990s for example, and there have been plenty of controversies in the past.
Ellison again slipped up in the same decade when he famously touted the death of the personal computer and the rise of the thin client (called the Network Computer).
In 2010 Oracle and Ellison also bitterly upset the open source community with the purchase of Sun Microsystems (which owned Java). Oracle then went to file a bitter lawsuit with Google, after Oracle alleged that Android infringed its Java patents.
And Ellison has repeatedly clashed with a former software partner (SAP) and he has made repeated digs against IBM, Amazon and other rivals over the years. He also publicly slammed the board of HP after the departure of Mark Hurd as CEO.
Ellison promptly named Hurd as co-president of Oracle, and indeed Hurd is now one of two CEOs at the company
Software Giant
Despite these issues, the house that Larry built is hugely successfully and goes from strength to strength.
From its relational database origins, Oracle has expanded into the cloud, security, and boasts a portfolio that spans the ERP, CRM, analytics, middleware to name but a few.
As a result, Oracle looks well positioned to meet the challenges of the next decade.
Quiz: Think you know all about Larry Ellison and Oracle?
Here are three things we're verified Wednesday afternoon:
A KHOU 11 News viewer sent in a photo of a Walmart $1,000 gift card she received via email. She's a single mother and she wanted us find out if it was real.
We reached out to Walmart and a spokesman confirmed the coupon is a fake. Walmart never participates in these online coupon offers.
We also verified a viral photo of Whoopi Goldberg making the rounds again on social media. It's a violent image of President Trump hurting himself with the word's "Making America Great Again."
The picture has been circulating around on social media for almost a year. Even Goldberg addressed it on ABC's "The View" where she proved it was photoshopped and a fake.
Finally, we verified the news out about Ambien. The prescription drug has been trending on Twitter all day thanks to a tweet from Roseanne Barr. Barr wrote, "It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting."
That tweet was an explanation for another tweet about former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett where she compared her to an ape. Barr somehow linking her racist tweet to side effects of Ambien.
That claim we can verify is false. Ambien drug manufacturer Sanofi responding to Barr's tweet saying "While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."
To be fair Ambien has led to behavioral side effects in some patients.
Is there something you'd like us to verify, email us at verify@khou.com or reach out to us on Facebook and Twitter.

STORRS, Conn. (WTNH) — The dream didn't last long for the women of Quinnipiac.
UConn's size and speed was simply too much for the Bobcats on Monday night.
Quinnipiac's school record of 23-straight wins came to a screeching halt in round two of the NCAA women's basketball tournament.

The top-ranked UConn women pulled away from the start on their home court at Gampel Pavillion.
“They did hang in there,” stated UConn senior Olson Briceno. “…I definitely expected like 100 by half.”
“Yes, I give them respect,” said UConn freshman Annie Carnes. “But they didn't really have a chance, we are UConn women's basketball, come on!”
Despite, the loss, Quinnipiac certainly had a strong representation of proud fans at the game. Quinnipiac students turned out in force as hundreds wore bright-yellow and waved their streamers while they cheered. It was an uphill battle, and a losing battle in the end, but the fans are still proud of their team.
“I'm excited for them. I mean, they had such a good run, they should be happy that they made it to the NCAA tournament again, and they killed it tonight!” Exclaimed Quinnipiac senior Francesca Capasso. “Whether they think it or not, they should walk out of here with a smile on their face.”
“The UConn program is huge, but Quinnipiac, you know, go Bobcats!” Stated Hamden resident John Setzko. “…Both Connecticut schools, I love them both!”

A student nurse has captured a ' ghostly figure' sat in her armchair and she believes could be a previous tenant who died in the cottage.
Rebecca Keast had already heard strange noises one night last month when her dog Gilly suddenly woke up at 2am and began barking at the chair.
When the TV also started playing up, the 24-year-old was compelled to snap two photos to see what she would capture.
She was stunned to discover one photo showed the shape of a man sat in the seat while the other image didn't.
Her neighbours later confessed that they had to call in paranormal investigators because of all the ghostly goings-on.
(Image: Mercury Press)
Rebecca's end terrace cottage in Portsmouth, Hampshire, was previously joined with next door through a passageway and the previous tenant enjoyed access to both properties – however is said to have died there.
She believes the spooky figure is either the deceased tenant or the ghost of her dad Simon trying to protect her. He died aged 44 of a heart attack in 2012.
Rebecca said: "Ever since I've lived here, I've sensed a man watching me. I feel like he tries to contact me and I only hear and see things when I'm alone.
"I spoke to my neighbours and asked them about it. They said years ago someone came over to investigate their own house and found that there were two ladies and a man present.
(Image: Mercury Press)
"The man apparently 'wanders' and the area I see the orbs is where there used to be a walkway connecting both our houses. It's now a cupboard [and the corridor is] blocked off.
"I don't know how long ago the man died but it was as if he had wandered in and sat down to watch TV with us.
"Many other times I have seen orbs when sat down watching TV. They usually cross one corner of the room to the chair area."
Before she knew of the young man who passed away in her home, Rebecca could sense ghosts around the house and because of this, decided to snap what her pet Labrador was looking at.
(Image: Mercury Press)
Rebecca said: "The night I took the photograph, I heard loud rolling noises upstairs. We have carpeted floors but it sounded like a metal ball on a wooden floor.
"We were watching a war film and my dog was fast asleep on me. He got up suddenly and stared at the corner chair.
"I took a photo straight away and it revealed what appears to be a man sat down. It's freaky because on the live photo version, the TV said 'look at me' then the man appears on the chair."
After initially being startled by her discovery, Rebecca claims she feels more settled knowing the ghost isn't causing her any harm.
A psychic recently told her the ghost could be her dad and she admits it is comforting to think he's looking out for her.

Rebecca said: "My dad passed away six years ago and sometimes I do think it might be him. Maybe he wants to look after me as my health isn't great at the moment.
"But he never believed in ghosts and I know he wouldn't want to scare me.
"The man scared me at first but after a while I just thought, it isn't nasty. I wish I knew what he wanted.
"I'd love to know who the ghost is. My mum's friend thought it was a man who used to live here and died young, but a psychic thinks it's my father.
"It would bring me comfort if I knew it was my dad, but because I'm not certain it's him and it could be the other younger man, I'm more unsure about it."
Naples, December 11 - A sizeable piece of the roof of the Caserta royal palace fell late on Sunday morning, fortunately not injuring anyone. The incident occurred in the 'Sala delle Dame di Compagnia', where there were no visitors at the time since access to the balcony was restricted. The pieces fell in the middle of the room, near the queen's bathroom. "There was no structural" damage, museum director Mauro Felicori said. While awaiting more in-depth assessments scheduled for Monday, Felicori said that prior restoration efforts in that area had made use of outdated methods. "At the moment," he said, "one can assume that it was the result of restoration work done after the 1930 earthquake that did not hold up well and strengthening interventions carried out in 1985, when cement injections were still used. Over time, these were found to be incompatible at times with lime." "Unfortunately," he added, "these issues - which have nothing structural about them - are not visible from the outside and in previous months there were no signs of detachment when for the first time a survey was carried out on the state of conservation of the internal finishings of the halls in the historic apartment. Next week we will assign the restoration works." Felicori discussed what technical experts had said, noting that the layer of plaster that fell was from the entire surface area of the window frame and that it had not given prior signs of detachment and that there had not been any signs of water infiltration, cracks, or degradation of any sort. The fact that the plaster fell all together makes it seem that it was a layer that had been entirely redone and redecorated in the repairs after the 1930 earthquake. The section is close to the part of the building that suffered the worst damage from the 1980 earthquake, as well, while in 1985 chains were installed in the walls using long cuts and cement injections, which may have caused it as well. Surveyors noted that this part of the royal apartment "is a vulnerable section of the palace structure", evinced by the fact that "after every earthquake, even with an epicenter far away, cracks in the plaster reopened in the stairwell", he said. Software showing micromovements may shed further light on the matter.
GoDaddy said the Daily Stormer violated its terms of service by labelling a woman killed in an attack at the rally in Charlottesville ‘fat' and ‘childless'. Photo: Reuters
Charlottesville (US): A prominent white nationalist website that promoted a Virginia rally that ended in deadly violence on Saturday is losing its Internet domain host.
GoDaddy tweeted on late Sunday night that it has given the Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider because the site has violated GoDaddy's terms of service.
GoDaddy spokesman Dan Race tells the New York Daily News that the Daily Stormer violated its terms of service by labelling a woman killed in an attack at the event in Charlottesville “fat” and “childless.”
Heather Heyer was killed on Saturday when police say a man plowed his car into a group of demonstrators protesting the white nationalist rally.
Shortly after GoDaddy tweeted its decision, the site posted an article claiming it had been hacked and would be shut down.

Children's birthday parties can be expensive.
The venue, food, decorations and entertainment all add up, and that's before you even started buying presents for the birthday boy or girl.
So when one mum's daughter said she just wanted a sleepover at home with a few pals for her 11th birthday, she was over the moon.
She ended up only spending £50 on pizza, sweets, a film, birthday cake and nail varnish painting essentials, so she decided to spend a bit extra on the party bags.
(Image: iStockphoto)
Her daughter invited four friends, and she sent each home with a gift bag containing pens, a notebook with the girl's initials on, a little nail varnish set, a book, a pair of novelty socks, sweets and a piece of birthday cake.
She said: "The bags cost £12.50 each so about £50 in total but given the party was cheap in comparison to previous years, with soft play, hall hire, pass the parcel etc, and my daughter and I had fun making them up I wasn't bothered."
However when her daughter came home from school a few days later she was carrying one of bags and a note from her friend's mum.
The other mum was not happy with the contents of the bag, and told her daughter to return it with a note from her explaining why she didn't want it.
"The letter basically says the bag was too generous as a party bag and her daughter was returning it as she (the mum) couldn't let her accept it.
(Image: iStockphoto)
"My daughter is really embarrassed as her friend told her that her mum says I try too hard.
"I'm mortified but also livid- I don't do the school run so only know this mum to say hello to when dropping kids off at hobbies/parties/play dates etc - I definitely don't want to impress her or anyone else."
She doesn't know how to handle the situation so posted on the parenting website Mumsnet to see what other people thought.
And other parents are equally outraged about what happened.
One woman wrote: "That is so unbelievably rude of her. Omg. My jaw literally dropped."
(Image: E+)
Another added: "That is really sad. You put all that effort in. I think she was really rude. I'm not sure the best way to approach it. You've done nothing wrong except make an effort and been nice."
A mum suggested: "I'd send them back with a note saying "I'm sorry you thought this was over the top but it was a gift and it seems a shame and rather over the top to deprive your DC of the pleasure it might give her. We had such fun making them, too.""
However some parents said the party bag was definitely too generous.
One wrote: "I would feel absolutely mortified to receive a party bag that generous, presents were usually £5-£7, so to receive a party bag in return of twice that value would make me feel extremely uncomfortable. I would not have returned it - how ungracious, but would have probably avoided you for some time after. Your generous gesture may have made people uncomfortable with their value of gift choice."
Another said: "I would have found the bags overgenerous, if I'm completely honest."
The Everton revival continued today as the Toffees managed a 1-1 draw against high-flying Liverpool in the Merseyside Derby. Rooney scored on a penalty kick after his fine pass set up the play that won the penalty. More on that in a moment.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp showed disrespect for Everton by fielding less than his best lineup. It will be interesting to see how that decision goes down these fans of the Red Shite.
Even so, Klopp's side thoroughly dominated the match. Before its recent evival, Everton suffered some heavy defeats. Yet even in those matches, Everton wasn't as outclassed as we were today.
Nonetheless, resolute defending and a bit of luck kept the match close. Liverpool scored as half time approached and nearly scored a second just before the whistle.
The second half was more of the same domination. However, the Shite couldn't get that second goal, even after Klopp finally brought two-star attackers off the bench.
Then, just before the 80 minute mark, came the decisive moment. Rooney had played as, in effect, a second right fullback in the first half, but our new manager, “Big Sam” Allardyce, moved him to a more attacking position in the second.
Rooney continued to see little of the ball in decent positions, but when he got possession Everton looked mildly threatening. And the threat was a little more than mild when Rooney picked out young Dominic Calvert-Lewin with an incisive pass that sent him into the penalty box.
Liverpool's Dejan Lovren was on hand to deal with Calvert-Lewin, though. The Everton forward went shoulder to shoulder with his marker and then fell down under very little contact. A softer penalty Everton rarely gets, and against Liverpool. Indeed, Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United would have been lucky to get it.
Even so, Lovren erred by putting out his arm with Calvert-Lewin running sideways, rather than towards the goal. Sometimes you can create your own bad luck.
Up stepped Rooney and even a pessimist like me knew he would bury the kick. He did so with aplomb.
It was Rooney's first goal in a Merseyside Derby. A boyhood Evertonian, he left us for Manchester United in 2004 at the age of 18, and returned this summer.
Good thing for us that he did. There's only one Wayne Rooney.
UPDATE: I just read that the penalty was only the second in 80 years awarded to Everton at Anfield, Liverpool's home field. Thus, if the penalty shouldn't have been awarded (as I believe), we can consider it a belated make-up call.

Nassau police unearthed the remains of an MS-13 victim in a Roosevelt park Wednesday, authorities said, hours after an investigation into a machete murder last July led to the arrest of a Freeport man and the latest discovery.
The remains at the Roosevelt Preserve were said to be bone fragments, according to a law-enforcement official, and were found about 1 mile into the park in woods abutting Frederick Avenue.
“It is no doubt an MS-13 murder,” Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said outside the park during a news conference with County Executive Laura Curran and District Attorney Madeline Singas.
Ryder said police began digging Tuesday night at the preserve after getting information on the death of Angel Soler, 16, of Roosevelt, who left home on his mint green bicycle July 21 and was killed.
His body was found in October in the woods off West Greenwich Avenue in Roosevelt, not far from Wednesday's crime scene, and authorities suspect he was also killed by MS-13 members.
Josue Figueroa-Velasquez, 18, of Freeport, was arrested Tuesday and charged with second-degree murder in Soler's death, the same charge faced by his alleged accomplices, David Sosa-Guevara of Wyandanch and Victor Lopez of Roosevelt.
Figueroa-Velasquez, of North Main Street, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Wednesday. He was held without bail. He was represented by Legal Aid.
Singas, who would not divulge Figueroa-Velasquez's specific role in Soler's slaying, said he was on the verge of being deported when investigators came up with enough evidence to charge him with the crime.

Online records show a warrant was filed Tuesday for his arrest.
Court papers said Figueroa-Velasquez — while acting in concert with four others, three of whom had been previously arrested — struck Soler with “a sharp cutting instrument believed to be a machete” and killed him.
“He played an integral part in this murder,” Madeline Singas said.
According to complaint filed against him, a fourth suspect is being sought in the Soler's death.
Officials did not cite a motive and also did not provide details about the remains discovered Wednesday.
Ryder said the victim would have to be identified by DNA tests and the discovery of remains should not “cause any kind of panic” in the community.
“The biggest concern we want people to know is this is an older murder,” the police commissioner said.
Officials said they have been investigating the deaths with federal Homeland Security agents, who were also at the news conference.
Guevara was arrested in November, and he and Lopez were indicted in January, the Nassau County district attorney's office said. Soler's mother last year told Newsday that she brought her son to the United States from Honduras four years ago to flee gang violence there.
Instead, Suyapa Soler and sources familiar with the case believe the teenager was killed by the MS-13 gang.
One law enforcement source had said last year that Sosa-Guevara had identified himself as an MS-13 member during previous contact with authorities.
Police did not release other details about the arrest of Figueroa-Velasquez. Soler's death was part of a wave of killings blamed on MS-13 last year.
It led to authorities intensifying their desire to eradicate the gang and toughen up on immigration.

A cannabis user who was caught with the drug revealed how he has been smoking cannabis as an alternative medication for anxiety and depression.
Chesterfield magistrates' court heard on Thursday, October 5, how Joseph Mellor, 23, of Derby Road, Matlock Bath, was stopped by police due to an unrelated matter when officers had grown concerned about a group acting suspiciously.
Prosecuting solicitor Becky Allsop said: “Mellor was seen by police and stopped due to an unrelated matter because they believed a group had been acting suspiciously.
“He smelled of cannabis and he said he had been smoking a joint and he had a grinder in a rucksack and it had 0.1grammes of cannabis in it.”
Mellor admitted the item found was cannabis and it had been the remnants from an earlier joint.
He told police he has been smoking cannabis for about seven or eight years.
Mellor pleaded guilty to possessing the class B drug after the incident on April 5 and it was accepted that this was for personal use only.
Defence solicitor Bertie Mather said the street value of the amount of cannabis recovered was £1.
He added that Mellor has not been working due to anxiety and depression and the overwhelming effects of his medication had become so stupefying that he had been using cannabis instead.
Magistrates fined Mellor £80 and ordered him to pay a £30 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

They're the Scandinavian equivalents of our own Cambridges, but Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway may eclipse them in the style stakes.
As part of the royal tour of Sweden and Norway , the glamorous pair welcomed Kate and William into their home for lunch at Skaugum.
The royal residence is in stark contrast to the fusty gilt and chintz of Buckingham Palace.
That wasn't the only contrast either.
While Haakon and Mette-Marit looked glamorous and relaxed (though, to be fair, it is their own home), Kate awkwardly kept her coat on.
Planning on making a swift exit, Kate?
The Duchess of Cambridge was pictured with her plum-coloured Dolce & Gabbana coat still firmly on and fastened up over her bump.
(Image: Getty Images Europe)
While it's currently a VERY chilly - 6° in Asker, where the estate is situated, we're sure the Norwegian royals have cranked the heating on for their guests.
But there's actually a good reason why she did.
Along with the nail polish rule and the nude tights rule, when it comes to coats, the women of the Royal family are bound by protocol.
Simply, they're not allowed to take them off in public as it's "unladylike to undress in public" OK! reports.
True, she's sat inside a royal residence, but there were obviously cameras around.
(Image: PA)
While Kate wowed at a formal dinner with the Royal family in caped McQueen, some of her other style choices have raised some eyebrows.
Pregnant Kate has also been targeted by trolls who slated a blue velvet Erdem dress, which cost an eye-watering £2,690.
The designer creation has been compared to "a pair of curtains" and described as "frumpy" and "horrible" - though that didn't stop it from selling out.
The night before, another Erdem dress raised some eyebrows, with one social media user calling it the "ugliest dress I have ever seen."
(Image: REUTERS)
"Whoever chose that dress for Kate, failed completely..." sniped another critic.
Being seven months pregnant, Kate is probably more concerned about being comfy than cutting-edge.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due to fly back home to the UK today, having concluded their tour.
In Greece, Many Asylum Seekers Are Stranded In Overcrowded Camps
The European Union's inability to agree on how to manage migration has turned some of Greece's Aegean islands into squalid dumping grounds for asylum seekers.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
When a million asylum seekers arrived in the European Union in 2015, there was a backlash. Some countries built walls. Some refused to accept refugees. The next year, EU leaders struck a deal with the Turkish government that kept most of the migrants in Turkey. Now, that drastically cut the number of asylum seekers crossing the sea, but, as Joanna Kakissis reports, from the Greek island of Lesbos, the deal left those who did reach Greece stranded in overcrowded camps.
(SOUNDBITE OF TENT STAKE TAMPING)
JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: A new tent seems to go up every day on a hill of olive trees next to the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos. Entire families live in these tents made of salvaged wood and tarp.
(CROSSTALK)
KAKISSIS: Walking around here, there are no garbage bins. There are no toilets. So the ground is covered with garbage and human feces. This is where the kids play.
(LAUGHTER, CROSSTALK)
RASHA AL-AHMAD: (Speaking Arabic).
KAKISSIS: Rasha al-Ahmad shudders as she wipes dirt from her 1-year-old daughter's face.
AL-AHMAD: (Through interpreter) I wash my children every day with this sponge because there's no running water. But with all this filth, I can't get them clean. As for me, I haven't had a shower in two weeks.
(SOUNDBITE OF TENT STAKE TAMPING)
KAKISSIS: Al-Ahmad, who's 25 and from Syria, would rather live in a tent in the mud than the EU-financed refugee camp next door. This camp is designed to hold no more than 2,000 people, but more than 6,000 are inside.
AL-AHMAD: (Through interpreter) When I go inside to get our food, I wait in line for hours. And people are angry and sometimes drunk. They get violent. They fight. And it's so dirty.
KAKISSIS: Someone's cut a hole in the tall razor-wire fence around the camp, so I slip inside. I've been here before but have rarely seen it this bad. My eyes water at the stench of urine, feces, rotting food. Leila Hassan, a 20-year-old from Somalia, covers her mouth. She says she vomited the first time she tried to use one of the public toilets which overflow with human waste.
LEILA HASSAN: (Through interpreter) When I first saw this situation, I wanted to go back home because it's like a prison, and we are the criminals.
KAKISSIS: Eva Cosse of Human Rights Watch believes this is the message the EU is sending to asylum seekers.
EVA COSSE: Don't come here because if you do, this is what you're going to suffer - overcrowded, very dirty, very unsanitary camps, sleeping literally on the concrete, on the ground. And this is happening in the European Union. It's unimaginable.
KAKISSIS: The EU has allocated nearly a billion euros in migration aid to Greece and insists Greek authorities are responsible for managing the camps.
(CROSSTALK)
KAKISSIS: But Greek Migration Minister Ioannis Mouzalas blames the EU. During a recent visit to Moria, he told journalists that the EU is not relocating enough refugees out of Greece.
IOANNIS MOUZALAS: (Through interpreter) For instance, we have so many unaccompanied minor children in this camp. The rest of the EU won't take them. It's easy to point fingers. It's much harder to take steps that will actually solve problems.
KAKISSIS: But figuring out how to manage migration is one of the EU's biggest challenges. Hard-line leaders such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz say the EU must be as ruthless as Australia, which bans people arriving by boat from seeking asylum in Australia. Instead they're sent to camps on Papua New Guinea and the Pacific island nation of Nauru, sometimes for years.
Under the 2016 deal between the EU and the Turkish government, migrants crossing from Turkey are only supposed to stay a short time on Aegean islands - until Greece's independent asylum service processes their requests for protection. Those denied asylum are supposed to be deported. But the asylum service is short-staffed, and the process takes months. Amal Adwan, a 47-year-old Syrian teacher, has waited four months for her appeal.
AMAL ADWAN: We only wait - for what? You don't know for what. Maybe they reject my asylum. Maybe they return me to Turkey.
KAKISSIS: But only a fraction of the more than 47,000 asylum seekers who've arrived since mid-2016 have been returned to Turkey. The Greek government wants to expand camps on the islands but is opposed by locals even on refugee-friendly Lesbos.
(SOUNDBITE OF RUNNING WATER)
KAKISSIS: I walk with retiree Kleoniki Chronis along a creek just outside her lemon-scented village, Moria, the neighboring village for which the camp is named. She points to a Roman aqueduct and says Moria used to be known for its history, not as Europe's Guantanamo.
KLEONIKI CHRONIS: (Speaking Greek).
KAKISSIS: "What's happening here is unacceptable," she says, "unacceptable for the refugees, for us, for Greece and for Europe." For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis on Lesbos.

Republican Rep. Tom Cole On Bump Stock Restrictions
House Republicans said they will consider restrictions on bump stock gun accessories. Steve Inskeep talks with Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma about his position.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
In an exceedingly rare development, Republicans say they're open to at least a discussion with Democrats about gun control - or at least one gun control measure. Republicans still broadly oppose new gun regulations. But House Speaker Paul Ryan says he wants to look at rules for bump stocks, which allow a weapon to fire somewhat like a machine gun. Bump stocks were apparently used by the shooter in Las Vegas on Sunday night. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also signaled some openness.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: We know that members of both parties and multiple organizations are planning to take a look at bump stocks and related devices. We certainly welcome that. We'd like to be part of that conversation.
INSKEEP: Well, let's continue that conversation with Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, who's on the line from Washington, D.C.
Congressman, good morning once again.
TOM COLE: Hi, Steve. Good to be with you.
INSKEEP: What makes this an item that Republicans are willing to regulate?
COLE: I think it's very obviously a device, which most of us knew nothing about until the awful tragedy in Nevada, that takes a legal, you know, product - or legal weapon and makes it, effectively, an illegal weapon. Automatic weapons have been illegal in this country since the 1930s. So I think people understand that immediately. They obviously see the horror of what happened. And they're, I think, mostly prepared to act on it.
INSKEEP: I wonder if, though, you can say that this is enough. You're correct that there have been restrictions on automatic weapons since the 1930s. But if you can't get a bump stock, you can still get a machine gun. It's just hard. And even if you can't get a machine gun, you can get an AR-15, which is a military-style rifle. Is it really going to be enough to ban or do something about bump stocks?
COLE: Well, I don't know if it's enough. But it's certainly, I think, the right thing to do. And in terms of getting a machine gun - yes, you can get one. They're legal. There were legal till, like, '86. And under very rare - but they're hard to get. They're extremely rare. We have none of them that have been used in a crime since that point that they were made illegal. So I think that's different. And AR-15's, quite frankly, there are millions of them in circulation. They're a legitimate, you know, weapon. And they're something that most people that have, you know, either have for defense, sporting purposes or hunting. So you know, yes, they've been used in crimes. That's true of a lot of different entities. But this is, I think, fundamentally different. I literally - when I saw the clips and listened to the soundtrack of what happened in Nevada...
INSKEEP: Yeah.
COLE: ...I had just assumed immediately it was an automatic weapon from the firing. I was shocked when I found out you could actually modify, you know, a semiautomatic weapon that easily.
INSKEEP: Is there anything larger that leaders in your party would be willing to sign onto that would address the problem of mass shootings?
COLE: You know, it depends on what you - I would argue that the best way to address this is actually mental health. And both parties have actually done quite a bit in that regard. But if you're talking in terms of, you know, individual actions that have to do with banning particular types of weapons, probably not.
INSKEEP: Let me ask about one other thing, Congressman, that I feel obliged to ask about because it directly involves your state and Obamacare.
The Washington Post reports that the state of Iowa is one of the states seeking flexibility to improve its insurance markets under Obamacare and hopefully lower premiums. They wanted flexibility to fix their insurance markets. And according to The Washington Post, President Trump read about this and personally intervened to make sure that Iowa was told no. And it's not the only example of this. I'm looking at a letter from the secretary of Health and Human Services from your state, Oklahoma. And apparently, Oklahoma was seeking flexibility to lower insurance premiums for thousands of people by 30 percent under Obamacare. But they needed permission from the administration, which just plain missed a deadline, and so that's not going to happen.
So here's my question - in your view, Congressman, is the administration intervening to make people's insurance premiums higher just because it doesn't like Obamacare?
COLE: No, I don't think so. I think - let's put the blame where it belongs, which is on Obamacare. And you know, in my state, it's a very flawed system. It's - we're having a 69 percent rate increase. You know, we don't get coverage - because we're a non-Medicaid expansion state - that other states receive. So look, I think the law is fundamentally flawed. And so I think that that's where I would put the responsibility.
INSKEEP: Let's even accept that premise. Nevertheless, there are ways to fix it apparently. According to your state's secretary of Health and Human Services, Terry Cline, they'd worked out a way to lower premiums by 30 percent for 130,000 people, and the administration didn't get back to them. Doesn't that indicate that the president would rather people pay higher premiums and suffer until Obamacare is repealed...
COLE: No.
INSKEEP: ...Which is something he's publicly said he wants to do?
COLE: Well, I don't think that's the case where the president's concerned. I don't know what happened in this particular instance. I know Dr. Cline is actually a terrific official, honestly. But, you know, I think this is something that the law is fundamentally flawed. We need to change it legislatively, not count on the administration to do it bureaucratically.
INSKEEP: Should the administration make the bureaucratic fixes that apparently are available?
COLE: In my opinion, yes.
INSKEEP: Should that be done even for Oklahoma in this case where the administration...
COLE: Of course. It should be done for every state. But, you know, again, I think a lot of these things are much harder to do bureaucratically than they should be. And legislation is the appropriate answer.
INSKEEP: Congressman Tom Cole, it's always a pleasure talking with you. Thanks for...
COLE: Thank you.
INSKEEP: ...Taking our questions.
Tom Cole is a member of the Republican House leadership and a representative from Oklahoma.

Trump Guts Requirement That Employer Health Plans Pay For Birth Control
Enlarge this image toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP Charles Dharapak/AP
The Trump administration is rolling back the Obama-era requirement that employer-provided health insurance policies cover birth control methods at no cost to women.
According to senior officials with the Department of Health and Human Services, the goal of the new rule is to allow any company or nonprofit group to exclude the coverage for contraception if it has a religious or moral objection.
"This provides an exemption and it's a limited one," said Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office of Civil Rights. "We should have space for organizations to live out their religious identity and not face discrimination."
He said he expects most companies will continue to provide coverage for birth control and that the changes will only affect a tiny percentage of U.S. women. The new rules are being published Friday in the Federal Register and go into effect immediately.
But some health policy analysts say the new rule creates a huge opening that lets any employer claim an exemption, leaving their female workers to pay the full cost of any birth control out of pocket.
"It is a huge loophole for any employer that does not want to provide birth control coverage to their employees," says Dania Palanker, a professor at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reform.
The change fulfills a promise Trump made in May to the Catholic religious order The Little Sisters of the Poor in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. The nuns had sued the Obama administration over the birth control requirement.
The Affordable Care Act requires employer-provided health insurance policies to include coverage for preventive health care. After the law passed, HHS used its regulatory authority to specify what has to be included in those preventive services, and birth control, including "all Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity."
But the policy was controversial from the start.
Several companies and religious groups sued, saying the rule infringed on their religious freedom.
The Obama administration created an exemption for churches, and allowed other "religious employers" to opt out by notifying the government. When they did so, the administration would arrange with their insurance companies to provide the coverage directly, without the employers' involvement.
But the Little Sisters of the Poor weren't happy with that workaround and sued.
The group's case, and a second one involving private businesses including the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores, went to the Supreme Court.
The court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby in 2014, saying privately held companies could object on religious grounds. And then, last year, the court issued a split ruling in the Little Sisters case, saying the government shouldn't fine the nuns, but also ordering the two sides to work out an arrangement that accommodates their religious beliefs.
Before a deal was reached, Donald Trump became president.
At the Rose Garden ceremony in May, he told the Little Sisters of the Poor that he planned to change the rules. "You're long ordeal will soon be over," he promised.
Under the new rule, women who work for Hobby Lobby or the religious group may no longer have access to birth control coverage through the Obama-era workaround. A Hobby Lobby spokesman said the company would have no comment on Friday, and the Little Sisters of the Poor didn't respond to NPR's emails seeking comment.
Hobby Lobby's founder and CEO David Green told reporters in 2013, "Our family is now being forced to choose between following the laws of the land that we love or maintaining the religious beliefs that have made our business successful and have supported our family and thousands of our employees and their families."
HHS officials said they don't expect many companies to seek waivers. They said the group seeking waivers will likely be limited to those approximately 200 companies and nonprofits that have already sued.
But Palanker says the impact could be a lot bigger. There are a lot of large private companies, she says, whose owners may hold strong religious beliefs but did not want the publicity and expense of suing the federal government.
Hobby Lobby has 32,000 employees.
"A lot of women will retain birth control coverage," Palanker says, "but there will be a lot of women who will lose that coverage."
That means they'll find themselves paying out of pocket. A one-month's supply of birth control pills can cost anywhere from $4 to $55 or more, according to GoodRX.com.
Longer-acting contraception, like an IUD, can cost more than $1,000, says Sarah Lipton-Lubet, a vice-president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. She says the new rule is a tool for discrimination against women.
"Women shouldn't be denied access to basic health care based on their employers' religious beliefs," she says. "We all have the right to our religious beliefs. But the way that this rule treats religion is really an excuse to discriminate."
HHS officials say they also plan more stringent enforcement of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that prohibits federal subsidies from being used for insurance policies that cover abortion. The agency will issue guidelines for insurers today on how they have to charge women who want abortion coverage at least $12 a year more for such a policy, and they have to keep that money in a separate fund to be used only to pay for abortions.
The Trump administration's rule is likely to face its own legal challenges from groups that favor contraception.
Uber said it would temporarily stop all its autonomous vehicle testing while it investigates a fatal crash in Arizona
Uber confirmed it has temporarily suspended all its self-driving car tests after one of its vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona while in autonomous mode.
The fatality in Tempe, Arizona, which occurred overnight, is thought to be the first caused by an autonomous vehicle on public roads.
“Our hearts go out to the victim's family,” Uber said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.”
Tempe police said the vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the crash, with a human safety driver but no passengers.
Tests suspended
In a prepared statement, the city's police department said the fatality involved a female crossing the street outside of the crosswalk.
“She was transported to a local area hospital where she passed away from her injuries,” police stated. “Her next of kin has not been notified yet so her name is not being released at this time. Uber is assisting and this is still an active investigation.”
Uber confirmed it is suspending tests in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.
The company's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said the incident was “incredibly sad”.
“We're thinking of the victim's family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened,” he said in a Twitter message.
The US' National Transportation Safety Board said it is investigating the accident.

1 Charge Against Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens Dropped As He Resigns From Office

Updated at 3:26 p.m. ET
Prosecutors have dropped one felony charge against Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, who will be resigning on Friday amid scandals about alleged misbehavior on the campaign trail and in the bedroom.
The governor's resignation was the result of a deal with prosecutors, who agreed to drop the charge if Greitens stepped down, St. Louis Public Radio reports.
The charge of computer tampering that was dismissed Wednesday stems from accusations of campaign finance violations — Greitens allegedly took a list of donors to his charity and improperly used it for fundraising. Prosecutors say they have enough evidence to convict Greitens but that his conviction wouldn't be worth pursuing after his resignation.
Greitens is also accused of taking a nude photo of a lover without her permission and using it to attempt to blackmail her into silence; a special prosecutor is currently deciding whether to refile charges in that case.
The deal that resulted in Greitens' resignation does not have any bearing on the special prosecutor's decision, according to St. Louis Public Radio.
State lawmakers have conducted an investigation into that blackmail charge, which uncovered allegations of sexual and physical abuse and led them to consider impeachment.
The governor has continued to deny any misconduct. "I have not broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment," he said Tuesday as he announced his resignation.
Greitens has called the charges against him a "witch hunt."
On Wednesday, as she announced that she was dropping the computer tampering charge, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner pushed back strongly against that characterization.
She said Greitens brought the charges on himself "by his actions, his statements, his decisions, his ambition and his pursuit for power," The Associated Press reports.
Gardner says she has enough evidence to pursue charges in the campaign finance case but that it's "not the right thing to do for our city or our state."
"If Mr. Greitens were convicted of this charge, it would be unlikely that he would be sentenced to prison, given his first-time-offender status and the type and level of the charge he faced," Gardner said at a press conference.
Gardner's statement did not acknowledge the agreement between prosecutors and Greitens' defense team, St. Louis Public Radio notes.
"Defense attorneys for Greitens contacted her office last weekend to strike a deal," Rachel Lippman of St. Louis Public Radio reports. In addition to the resignation and the dropping of the computer tampering charge, the deal also "prevents Greitens' attorneys from suing Gardner or any of her employees in civil court," Lippman says.
It does not prevent any other criminal charges, however, including the possibility of charges for Greitens over the sexual blackmail scandal.
Gardner originally brought charges against Greitens over that alleged misconduct, too — specifically, a felony violation of privacy charge.
The case did not go smoothly. Gardner and her team were accused of misconduct, including failing to turn over evidence and hiring a private investigator who allegedly lied under oath. A judge scolded the prosecutors but allowed the case to continue.
Then Greitens' lawyers said they planned to call Gardner as a witness — to be cross-examined by her own subordinates. Gardner's office decided to drop charges rather than be placed in that situation.
But that's not the end of the story. In dropping charges, Gardner's office announced plans to switch to a special prosecutor, rather than abandon the case entirely.
It's not clear when the special prosecutor will decide whether to refile those charges.

Report also says nearly 50,000 residents in the city cannot speak EnglishBritish white people are soon to become the minority in Birmingham while nearly 50,000 residents in the city cannot speak English, according to a new report There are thought to be residents from nearly 200 countries living in Birmingham which has been described as 'super diverse' in the city council's new cohesion strategy.The draft policy, which is due to be tabled before the council's cabinet today (Tuesday, June 26), states thatThat was an increase of 12 per cent from the 2001 survey and if the rate continues by the time of the next census in 2021 more than half of the city's 1.2 million-plus population will be from an ethnic minority.This is already the case for under 18s with 60 per cent coming from a non-white British background in the last poll."Birmingham is soon to become a majority of minority city," the report states.One of the main issues is that areas where there is a 'high concentration' of ethnic minority groups, particularly black and Asian communities, have become more disadvantaged.But there are recognised positives to a multi-cultural society.The report states: "Ethnic diversity can bring many benefits such as transnational trading links and high levels of cultural resource."Birmingham has benefited from its diverse migrant communities who have settled in the city and successfully contributed to its economic vitality, becoming leaders in education, medicine, sports, arts and business and providing employment opportunities to local people."Our demographic landscape is increasingly becoming ethnically and socially 'super diverse', which means a greater understanding of the changes in cultural norms, identities and social shifts in how we live work and learn is needed."The strategy aims at tackling a number of other barriers in the way of community cohesion including economic growth, gender inequality, job security, deprived neighbourhoods, educational attainment, income inequality and an ageing population.Equalities chief Cllr Tristan Chatfield said: "Birmingham faces a number of difficult social issues that have an impact on cohesion; whilst these are not unique to our city, we cannot assume that national government policy will address them."These are complex challenges and they are also rapidly evolving."Collectively, Birmingham should lead by example in challenging anything that prevents our citizens from reaching their full potential, including discrimination, poverty, segregation or a lack of ambition."The cabinet is expected to approve the draft strategy goes out to public consultation.
Uber Say It Will Cooperate With Investigation After Pedestrian Killed In Arizona Uber says it is cooperating with an investigation into a fatal accident involving one of its self-driving vehicles over the weekend.

Sony's E3 conference this year marked almost eight months to the day since the release of its PlayStation VR headset and that meant the pressure was on for the console giant to prove its commitment to the still fledgling platform.
Though the headset has now reached 1 million units sold, not everyone is convinced that virtual reality has the strength to hang around and remain a solid platform. It was essential, then, that Sony prove naysayers wrong with a bunch of new PSVR games.
Fortunately, it lived up to the task. At this year's show, Sony revealed not one but five new PSVR games. Not only do the games look engaging, they're diverse enough to draw a much wider audience into PSVR, ranging from shooter to puzzling platformer.

New Delhi: Addressing the nation on India's 71st Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid special emphasis on India's ongoing crisis in Kashmir.
PM Modi said the Kashmir issue couldn't be resolved through bullets and violence, but by embracing the Kashmiris and working for their betterment.
“Na gaali se samasya sulajhne wali hai, na goli se, samasya suljhegi har Kashmiri ko gale lagane se (Kashmir problem cannot be resolved by either bullets or by abuses. It can be resolved by embracing all Kashmiris),” Modi said in his fourth Independence Day speech, PTI reported.
“We have to work for the progress of Jammu and Kashmir and Kashmir's problem can only be solved by embracing Kashmiris. We all stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our brothers and sisters in Jammu and Kashmir. They have suffered a lot due to terrorism,” PM Modi said in his speech at the Red Fort.
The Union home ministry had in June stated that the ongoing UDAAN scheme was aimed at providing jobs to the skilled youth in the state. With more than 13,000 youth having gained from the Central Skill Development initiative, the ministry of home affairs had also stated that it aims at providing employment to more than 80,000 youth in the Kashmir valley across different sectors such as aviation, information technology and apparels.
Mentioning that 63 major development projects were currently underway in the state under the Prime Minister's Development Package (PMDP 2015) with a budget of Rs80,068 crore, the Prime Minister added that the Centre was determined to pull Kashmir out of the twilight zone and amalgamate it with the mainstream.
“We are determined to develop the state, educate the youth, give them jobs, include them in the mainstream, increase business and jobs and give them reasons to rejoice,” Modi said.
The Centre as well as security forces have been facing stiff resistance from the youth in the Valley, following Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani's killing in July last year. With Kashmir turning into a tinderbox following Wani's death, security forces—backed by the Centre—have toughened their stand.
While the home ministry stated that 92 terrorists had been killed till July this year alone, security forces have come down heavily on stone pelting incidents.
According to the home ministry's data, 2016 witnessed 2,690 episodes of stone pelting in Kashmir. In May this year, Major Leetul Gogoi was rewarded by the Indian Army after he was captured on camera using a Kashmiri man as a “human shield” against stone pelters—an action which only widened the chasm between the people of the valley and the Centre.

The home ministry has been stressing on the fact that the youth were being egged on by separatist leaders to hurl stones at the security forces.
The PM, while discussing the future growth trajectory of the disaffected youth in the valley, said that the agenda of the separatists was counter-productive.
He also sounded a warning not just for terrorists but also for those abetting terrorism.

“Kashmir problem will neither be solved by bullets nor by abusing each other. There is no question of being soft on terrorists. In the fight against terrorism, India is not alone today and is being actively supported by several countries across the world,” he added.
He also lauded the armed forces for effectively combatting infiltration from across the Pakistan border as well as for stepping up to any challenges that had been thrown at them.
In the shadow of the church in Annitsford lies the cemetery of St John the Baptist, containing the grave of Lieutenant William Henry Segrave, a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, the forerunner of the RAF.
The Northumbria World War One Project has been researching Lt Segrave and has just published his records on its database.
The 31-year-old instructor pilot was not from these parts. He was born in South Africa into a landed Catholic family from County Wicklow, where his father was a retired army major.
In the 1911 census he was still in Ireland, visiting family friends in Cork, but William, like his father, seems to have had a penchant for adventure and we find him before the war as a rubber planter in the Malay Peninsula.
He joined the Malay States Volunteer Rifles in May 1912 and served until January 1915, when he came back to dear old Blighty.
Whether he had some flying experience in the Far East is unclear, but back in England he mastered the ‘old kites' and was soon teaching others to fly, including the squadron based at Cramlington airfield.
He was on a long haul flight from the south on February 12, 1917, bringing back a new 90hp biplane, a BE2c, when he crashed at the Blue Stoops, near Chesterfield, and died moments later.
Researchers have uncovered reports of his inquest, published in the Derbyshire Times on April 17, 1917.
It appears that he was flying quite low and seemed to be searching for a field. Pilots on long flights would often land in a farmer's field, usually on the scrounge for food. Whether this was the case with Lt Segrave, or that he had some kind of mechanical trouble, was never determined.
Witnesses reported that it was a clear day, with occasional gusts of wind, which may have been a factor.
Lt. Segrave's plane clipped a tree and somersaulted twice, before landing nose down with him underneath. He died of a fractured skull.
The Coroner remarked that “although the dangers of flying had very considerably diminished, they were still very great and that this was an example of how unexpected an accident may occur”.
Indeed, there were more pilot deaths during the war in accidents while training than in combat.
The body of Lt Segrave was taken to Chesterfield Station in an oak coffin, draped with the Union flag, and army volunteers from Chesterfield acted as a guard of honour as his body was put aboard the 1.20pm train to Newcastle.
He had been married less than a year to Lily Exell in Marylebone. She never remarried and died in 1971, aged 82.
William's brother Hugh, also a pilot, was shot down one month before from 7,000ft and emerged with only a few scratches, such are the vagaries of war.

Anti-Semitic graffiti has found its way back into Ballard Park.
Ridgefield police announced in a press release Wednesday, June 14, that there was an ongoing investigation into graffiti in the park.
The symbols were discovered around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
“Responding officers discovered anti- Semitic symbols and statements, as well as racist statements on the park stage,” Capt. Jeff Kreitz said.
“Officers also discovered spray paint on one of the stone walls in the park.”
Police said the graffiti has been cleaned up by the Ridgefield Parks and Recreation Department.
Anyone with information regarding this incident is encouraged to call police headquarters at 203-438-6531 or the anonymous tip line at 203-431-2345.
One of three dogs is loaded into a Broward County Animal control truck after an 8-month-old girl was bitten by a family dog and died from her injuries, May 30, 2018, in Miramar, Fla.

An 8-month-old baby girl died Wednesday in Miramar, Fla., after she was attacked by a family dog, local police said.
The infant was in the care of her grandmother at the time of the attack, Miramar Police Officer Yessenia Diaz told USA TODAY.
The family owns three pit bulls — a mother, one male sibling and one female sibling. The grandmother was walking the dogs when the male dog, which police said was 3 or 4-years-old, got away from her and attacked the baby who was bobbing in a bouncy chair in one of the bedrooms.
The family raised the male dog who attacked the child from a puppy. Broward County and Animal Care and Adoption officials removed all three dogs. Diaz said the dog that attacked would "most likely" be put down, but it would depend on the result of an evaluation by animal control experts.
Police withheld the identity of the victim and her family because the parents asked for time to inform other relatives, the Sun Sentinel reported.
Police were the first to arrive. When fire and rescue officials got to the scene, they declared the child dead, Diaz said.
Diaz said that a victims services unit was made available to provide counseling and support not only to the child's family but also to the first responders at the scene.
"Who isn't going to be affected by that, especially when they're looking at the crime scene?" Diaz asked.

Eight couples have descended on a tropical Mexican resort hoping to save their faltering relationships... little do they know they aren't in for a relaxing retreat but more of a testing nightmare.
For couple Jess and Matt Make or Break was a chance to see if their argumentative three-year relationship was worth the pain.
Matty admits his insecurities are getting in way of their relationship but can he change his ways and go the distance with Jess?
Here's what they had to say.

Describe your partner in three words…
Charming, chivalrous and funny.
How did you meet?
He hates me telling this story but I was actually doing Miss England at the time and he added me and I thought, ‘OK, I'll accept'. He had his top off in his picture and he looked like a bit of an idiot. I just wouldn't reply to any of his messages and it got to the point where he seemed like such a nice lad. He ended up being not as bad as I thought!
What are Matty's best points?
He always opens doors and he is so polite. Things like that that I think are missing in men nowadays.
What are Matty's bad points?
He can be a little bit indecisive sometimes and that is why I make most of the decisions in our relationship. I would like him to be a bit more assertive and be like, ‘This is what I want to do'. And his smoking! Matty definitely had a lot of cigarettes while he was there; he had like ten a day! I did not know he smoked that much!

Why did you want to go on the show?
Initially, we just thought we're going to get to go away to this gorgeous place, a five-star resort. It's not even going to be that bad, it's going to be fine. Then when we first got there and they just put it on us that you're going to be dating other people, it was definitely a shock for us. I never thought it would be to the extreme of sharing a room, sharing beds, I never thought it would be that. So it was a shock, but initially I was cool with it. Then they started getting deeper and telling us exactly what we were going to be doing!
Did you set any ground rules before arriving?
We had originally said if we have got to share we're not going to do it! We don't want to be in another bed with someone else, it's just weird.
What did you think when you saw where you'd be staying?
When we pulled up the weather was gorgeous, it was 35 degrees and there were these big gates. It was all very five star and posh and the views were insane. When we were given the uniforms we didn't think we were going to have to wear uniforms the whole time! But that colour grew on us, we like green now!
How did you get on with the other people?
Dinner times were fun and everyone used to laugh. It was so good that we were all similar people and we had all been in quite long terms relationships and we all got on. Most of the time were good - we talk about the negative times but there were really good times as well!
Did you think you'd last the distance on the show?
I always said to him, ‘Listen, if you really want to go we will go, but I just wasn't prepared to go on the first day'. All of our emotions were everywhere and it would have been wrong to go on the first day.

Describe your partner in three words…
Intelligent, beautiful and a lot of self-respect.
What are Jess's best points?
She is very driven, when she wants something she will go for it. She's motivational- she has helped me get where I am today. She is very good looking.
What are Jess's bad points?
She is very snappy. When she doesn't get her own way she will start like a Rottweiler biting my ankles. She can be quite bossy and controlling. She doesn't stop me from doing it but she will grind at me for two hours until I say, ‘I'm just not going to do it now.'
Why did you want to go on the show?
It was to learn about ourselves and I wanted to go on to help other people because I have been through a lot in the past. I have been through depression. And obviously to learn about me and Jess. We haven't been through certain situations, which were thrown at us over there, so I wanted to know how me and her would react. I didn't react too well!
Did you set any ground rules before arriving?
(Image: Publicity Picture)
Originally we said we're not going to share a room with anyone because that's just not us as people. Then when it happened I said, ‘Jess I'm going, I'm not doing this.'
What did you think when you saw where you'd be staying?
The place was absolutely amazing. There was a crocodile pond. I didn't see any but according to the locals it's a crocodile pond. You can't put into words how nice it was.
What was going through your mind when Paul told you what would be happening?
We went to the circle and got told we were going to be dating other people's partners. I was like; ‘You're taking the p*ss! I am not into this!' My head just fell off my shoulders, Jess kept hers on a little bit and then it turned into an argument. But I coped, I did it in the end. But once they announced that we were going to be swapping partners I was like no way.
Did you think you'd last the distance on the show?
Once that was announced, in my mind I was going. I was leaving. But then it was Jess who kept me staying. She said, ‘Give it a go, you've quit your job for this.' That was what made me give it a go and I didn't look back.
And what about Louise the sex therapist?
I thought some of them didn't interest me but there was one where I nearly broke down. Jess broke down. I was like wow. She said, ‘What is your worst fear?' and I said, ‘Losing Jess' and Jess said, ‘Trust' and they both linked together. I just quivered like a little girl!
U.K. Prime Minister Calls For Early Election, U.S. Special Election In Georgia
Steve Inskeep talks to the BBC's Jonny Dymond about Theresa May calling for an early general election in June. Domenico Montanaro of NPR's Politics team discusses the House election in Georgia.
With Hurricane season just a few days away, now is the time to make a plan. Especially figuring out how to contact your loved ones during a power outage.
Here are the best methods of communication during a storm, according to experts.
Traditional telephone service vs Broadband-enabled telephone service: This may not be the most popular option, but having a landline telephone can be a lifesaver when access to a cellphone or other electronic devices is limited or non-existent.
You'll want a corded phone because cordless home phones rely on electric power. If the power goes out, there is no way to charge it.
If you use a Broadband-enabled telephone service such as voice over internet protocol (VoIP), it won't work during an electric outage without a battery or other backup power source.
Make sure to test your battery often. Understand how long it should last, learn how to replace it, and consider having a spare that you can charge before a storm. If you do not have a battery or other backup power source, ask your provider where you can purchase one.
Charging digital devices before a storm: Keep your mobile devices, laptops or tablets charged.
Have a car charger or back up battery packs handy. If you have multiple devices, consider having a multi-port back up to charge them all at the same time. Try not to wait last minute to purchase these items as they tend to go fast.
Remember, many first responders and government officials use social media to keep you alert. Of course, the 10 news app will also send important information to your phone.
Be prepared for high call volume: During an emergency, many people are trying to use their phones at the same time. The increased calling volume may create network congestion, leading to “fast busy” signals on your wireless phone or a slow dial tone on your landline phone. If this happens, hang up, wait several seconds, and then try the call again. This allows your original call data to clear the network before you try again.
Texting instead of calling: It requires fewer network resources, text messages may go through more quickly than voice calls.
Have a family communications plan: Choose someone out of the area as a central contact, in case your family is separated. Most importantly, practice your emergency plan in advance.
HAM Radio: When things have gotten bad, experts suggest using a ham radio.
A five-watt handset can achieve 10+ miles of range on flat ground using a repeater and can also reach halfway across the country. You'll want to tell your family in advance what frequencies you can be reached on, and what times you will be listening.
Satellite phone (Satphones): These are on the pricier side, but experts say they can be beneficial in places where internet access is scarce.

One kind-hearted person's gesture towards a homeless woman recently turned into something altogether more ugly.
All thanks to a cruel note scrawled on a drinks cup.
A Dunkin' Donuts customer had chosen to buy a homeless woman a drink from a branch in Cincinnatti, Ohio.
The employee who prepared the drink decided to take "matters into her own hands" and add a heartless message.
It read: "Stop 'hangin' in front of the store if you have a full-time job. - Mgmt."
While the original post has been deleted, a photo of the cup with the inscription has been saved and shared.
Store owner Mike Benhase has since confirmed that the employee is no longer with the company.
"It goes against everything we stand for," Benhase told The Cincinnati Enquirer .
"We're just a small family business and we preach to our employees long and hard about the values of respect and dignity.

"I feel bad for that person," Benhase continued.
"I would very much like the chance to reach out to the person and apologise for what happened."
Dunkin' Donuts told Mirror Online:
"Dunkin' Donuts and our franchisees share the goal of creating a welcoming and hospitable environment for all guests.
"The franchisee who owns and operates this restaurant informs us that the employee that was involved in this situation is no longer with his organization."
Jared Goff wrapped up his rookie season on Sunday, completing a career-high 65% of his passes in a Rams loss to the Cardinals. The Rams amassed just 123 yards of total offense in a game that really meant nothing to anyone. Except this guy who had a Goffman costume made and then wore it in public to support Jared Goff. Unless this was ironic. Man, imagine having customized L.A. Rams Duffman-parody Jared Goff costume money.
Goff finished the season with 1089 passing yards, 5 touchdowns, 7 interceptions and zero wins. And while quarterback wins are the dumbest stat, zero in 7 starts is still pretty remarkable.
A Balance Sheet of 15 Years
The AKP (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi-Justice and Development Party) is celebrating 15 years in power in Turkey. The party came to power in November 2002, against the backdrop of the major 2001 crisis and amidst a legitimacy crisis of the then mainstream political parties stemming from the crisis-ridden 1990s. The AKP's policies brought about significant transformations in the state, economy and the society. Conventionally, the first two terms of the AKP government (2002-2011) were identified with democratization, reformism and progressive economic policies. The fact that the government's authoritarianism reached inconceivable levels post-2011 (especially during and after the Gezi protests of 2013), and the fact that Turkey is governed under the state of emergency since the failed coup attempt of July 2016 [Ed.: see Bullet No. 1286] which resembles an ‘exceptional state' form, have made conventional accounts to argue that Turkey is sliding toward ‘authoritarianism'. These accounts simply share the ‘good AKP goes bad' view, and ‘class' or ‘labour' is absent in their analyses.
In distinction, I sustain the argument that, ‘neoliberal authoritarianism' or ‘authoritarian neoliberalism' marked the post-1980 military coup which aimed to remove labour as an agency from the political sphere, and in fact the AKP's general economic and political stance reflected a continuity with this orientation. There is no doubt that there might be some type of ‘qualitative' shift in the form of authoritarianism post-2011 or post-coup attempt, however this is not a ‘deviation' from neoliberalism and should be contextualized within the capitalist social relations of production and restructuring of capital-labour relations.
In this light, this piece attempts to critically review these 15 years from a labour-centred perspective and shed light on developments in labour market and labour movement. The topics are as follows: economic policy-making, the legal context of labour relations, unionism, unemployment, and indebtedness.
1. Economic Policy-Making
Neoliberal economic policy-making is anti-democratic; and constantly attempts to remove democratic and working-class participation from policy-making processes. The intellectual origins of this orientation go back to the diagnosis of the crisis of capitalism in the 1970s by neoliberals that the excess of democracy had weakened the ‘liberal' resolve of the state and its authority (Bonefeld, 2017). Hence, under neoliberalism, state managers constantly attempted to insulate certain policies and institutional practices from popular dissent, which is an authoritarian tendency in itself (Bruff, 2014).
Economic and political developments in Turkey under neoliberalism reflect this tendency. However, the 2001 crisis, and the AKP's take over of the power in 2002 amounted to the strengthening of these tendencies. Certain institutions were depoliticized and de-democratized through extra-democratic technocratic institutions (i.e. Central Bank, Independent Regulatory Institutions), and attempts were made to present certain policies ‘out of influence' by introducing ‘binding rules' (i.e. IMF agreements, debt ceilings, primary surplus targets, EU conditionality). The state of emergency in the last 16 months has strengthened this stance, and with the introduction of new institutions such as the Turkey Wealth Fund and the further decreasing role of parliament, policy-making is almost completely isolated from democratic interference.
2. Legal Framework of Labour Relations
Following a protracted demand from capitalist circles, the AKP introduced a new Labour Law in 2003 (Law No. 4857). This law introduced and institutionalized new forms of flexible employment and increased the control and disciplinary power of employers in the workplace, as well as reducing the extent of ‘job security'. It paved the way for further precarity, insecurity and de-unionization in the labour market whose political economic consequences will be dealt with later in this piece. In 2012, the AKP introduced a new Trade Union and Collective Bargaining Law (Law. No. 6356). Despite being presented as a ‘progressive' step from the previous law by the government, it simply kept the post-1980 authoritarian union policy intact and did not bring about any progressive change to labour relations. Hence, the overall aim of the labour legislation in this era – reflecting the characteristic of authoritarian neoliberalism – was ‘individualizing labour laws and weakening collective bargaining processes and institutions' (Clua-Losada and Ribera-Almandoz, 2017).

Aside from these major legal developments, the AKP government has also used omnibus bills to restructure labour relations in order to make labour more flexible and competitive. More recently, following the coup attempt, statutory government decrees are used for restructuring of state-capital-labour relations, which makes the management of labour power even more anti-democratic.
3. Trade Union Policy and the Condition of Unionism
As mentioned above, the AKP government took over the authoritarian neoliberal orientation of the Turkish state post-1980, which aimed to ‘put an end to class-based politics' (Yalman, 2009). From the very beginning, the AKP's trade union policy was authoritarian, even during the so-called ‘democratization' era of 2002-2011. Hence, as de-unionization and weakening of collective bargaining power was a crucial aspect of this era; unionization levels decreased by 46% between 2001-2011, making Turkey the least unionized country in the OECD area, with union density in 2011 at just 5.4% (Çelik, 2015). The number of workers covered by collective agreements also decreased by 50% from 1990s to 2010s (Labour Ministry statistics), despite the number of workers at work having significantly increased. Currently, the union density is around 11% and membership rates appear to be on the rise. This, however, is due to the government's corporatist union strategy which promotes unionism in AKP-friendly unions.
Another aspect of authoritarian union policy is strike bans and police violence toward workers' protests. 13 strikes were ‘postponed' or, more correctly, banned by the AKP government since 2002. Five of them occurred during the state of emergency following the July 2016 coup attempt. President Erdoğan himself declared that the government is making use of the state of emergency to ban strikes, in a speech made to the businessmen. During its rule, the AKP government has not hesitated to use police power in order to disperse workers' resistances and occupations. Moreover, May Day celebrations in symbolic Taksim Square were banned between 2003-2008, and again after 2011.
4. Unemployment
Following the 2001 crisis, unemployment levels increased to double digits, and remained in double digits for the most of the AKP rule. Officially, unemployment currently stands at around 10-11% officially. Unions, however, argue that it is actually higher than the official rate. Also, youth unemployment is around 20%, which is alarming. The high unemployment rate is directly related to the AKP's economic policies. Following the 2001 crisis, inflation targeting and achieving anti-inflationary credibility became the most important objective of the Turkish state managers, and therefore there was no meaningful employment strategy in place. Hence, the high growth years were actually amounting to what is known as ‘jobless growth', depending on ‘hot money' flows and financialization and exacerbated by AKP's aggressive privatization policy. As the official unemployment rate increased to an alarming 16% in February 2009, the government took some measures. However, these were mostly aimed at making the labour market more flexible, as the government's National Employment Strategy (NES-2014-2023) suggests. Unemployment remains as a significant problem for the current labour market in Turkey.
5. Rising Indebtedness of Workers
Turkish political economy witnessed a new development during the AKP rule: the rising indebtedness of households and/or shifting of the debt from the state to the households. Two elements played a significant role in this development. First, following the 2001 crisis, austerity policies meant that the government debt and deficit decreased, and the banks could not finance government deficits anymore. They had to find new ways (Karaçimen, 2014). Second, the condition of labourers deteriorated significantly in this period. Real wages decreased in manufacturing, and the minimum wage did not show any meaningful increase. Unemployment and precariousness increased significantly. These all paved the way for rising indebtedness of workers. Indeed, the ratio of household debt to disposable income was insignificant in 2003 (7%), but increased to 55% in 2013. Moreover, this trend rather affected the low-income households most, as 42% of the borrowers of consumer loans were people earning less than TL 1,000 per month (Karaçimen, 2014).
The AKP had to take some measures in 2013 to limit credit expansion, and these measures controlled rising indebtedness to some extent. However, following the economic contraction after the 2016 coup attempt, the government again had to rely on credit expansion for economic growth and household debt began to increase again. Overall, during this period, rising indebtedness added a new dimension to capital-labour relations in Turkey, and functioned as a disciplining mechanism.
Concluding Remarks
The 15 year AKP rule cannot be fully examined without taking the question of labour into account. This short paper attempts to do that. I argued that the AKP era represented a direct continuity with the post-1980 authoritarian management of labour power. Conventional accounts which identify earlier periods of the AKP with democratization, reform, and progressive economic policies fail to assess the anti-democratic and authoritarian neoliberal management of the economy and labour relations. In this context, any democratic struggle against the current authoritarian/exceptional state form should prioritize the issue of class, specifically labour, in order to achieve democratic outcomes.

PORT DOVER -
Jillian Adams knew right away that her decision to join the Lighthouse Festival Theatre's annual community show was a good one.
A graduate of Lighthouse's junior company, Adams recently returned to the area, just in time to be part of the Tony award-winning play 'A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Forum'.
“I didn't know of this play before, but the first read-through I was laughing hysterically, it was really funny,” said Adams. “Derek (Ritschel, artistic director) has done an awesome job of bringing out really subtle humour in it and adding even more to the show.”
The show features 19 Haldimand and Norfolk-based actors on stage and a crew of 15 volunteers working behind the scenes. A dozen choreographed numbers are part of what's described in a media release as a “sexy musical following Pseudolus (Meredith Wood), a crafty slave who struggles to win the hand of a beautiful but slow-witted courtesan named Philia (Adams) for his young master, Hero (J.P. Antonacci), in exchange for freedom”.
Carmen Davis, who plays Protean No.1 said the script has a similar feel to when the group hit the stage in Young Frankenstein in 2015.
“You've got the singing, the dancing, a lot of action taking place and of course a lot of underlying humour,” Davis added.
“You're not going to regret spending the $22 for an evening of laughter. You can't help but smile when you watch the show.”
A portion of the cast, including Kristin Reid, Brian Reichheld and Davis, has been involved in the last two community shows and that's been evident to the newcomers since preparations began in January.
“I've just been really impressed with how efficient rehearsals have run and how everything is coming together. I didn't realize we had so much talent in the community,” said Adams.
“It was obvious a lot of them know each other well and they've been really good with welcoming me. I now feel part of the cast too, but there's definitely good chemistry amongst the repeat actors.”
Eight performances are scheduled between April 20-30 for a show that's one of the theatre's most anticipated events each year.
“The community show is one of my favourite parts of the year,” Ritschel said in a release.
“Each year it continues to be the most honest, joy-filled rehearsal hall one could possibly hope for.”
Ritschel has high praise for the cast for not only taking on the challenge of a musical but doing so in a relatively short time span.
“I think what they're doing is remarkably brave, to not just do a show but to sing and dance and act and do it all in under three months is nothing short of impressive to me,” Ritschel added. “Each actor gets to shine in their own way and express themselves artistically.”
Tickets to 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum' are $22 and are available at the LFT box office or online at lighthousetheatre.com.

He was one of Bristol's loudest, fiercest and most relentless campaigners and as mourners gathered for the funeral of Steve Norman, it was clear his legacy would live on.
It was a gathering of family, friends, fellow campaigners and people he'd supported or mentored over the years, with everyone swapping anecdotes in the chilly winter sunshine at South Bristol Crematorium of his exploits.
Even the official celebrant Dee Ryding said that, while she had never personally met the man known as the Avon Mouth, she had once stood behind him at a demonstration and wondered why he even needed his loudhailer.
It was a fitting tribute to the man whose gruff Bristolian burr had never been tamed by decades in the Merchant Navy. Among his fellow battlers-in-arms against council cuts and closures were several of the councillors, who had sometimes found themselves on the wrong end of his rapier wit and deafening megaphone.
And, along with the Bristol Post, there were also other reporters paying their respects to the man who had a knack for coming up with eye-catching stunts to protest whichever because he was fighting for at the time.
A remarkably selfless man, it was always someone else's battle he fought – people who struggled to get their voice heard. In the early years he was fighting for disabled people faced with closures of day centres, or the elderly whose nursing homes were being closed. In latter years, it was the homeless or the victims of Bristol's housing crisis who were his focus.
Each time people would come to him and ask him to shout for them, and he would. He never said no, and by doing things like choreographing the wheelchair-bound to block the bottom of Park Street, or occupying empty council houses to prevent them being sold off, he very often won.
His stunts were always attention-grabbing and often piercing in their satire. Last September, Bristol prepared for a huge protest march called by the mayor against the austerity he himself was being forced by the Government to impose.
On the eve of the demo, Steve pitched up at City Hall with loaves and fishes and told a bemused security guard he'd come to help Marvin with the catering for those attending the march.

At the march itself, he was the loudest of those on the sidelines, protesting at the 'official' protest itself.
Ironically enough, he hit national headlines after the Post revealed he was fighting a cause, for once, for himself. He and his neighbours were outraged when, last year, the council limited the time their communal laundry room could be used.
He took the council to court – and of course won – and ended up the subject of a feature-length Radio 4 documentary which was, poignantly, broadcast last week on what would have been his 60 birthday.
The funeral service revealed the uncompromising fighter for the downtrodden and voiceless, but also a caring man who offered support to others fighting in the metaphorical trenches too.
“Most of us knew the loud, gruff, outspoken, chain-smoking Steve, some of us got to see his kind caring side, to many he was a thorn, a rogue, someone to avoid, an absolute nightmare,” said fellow campaigner Kerry Bailes.

“Those people were often the elected. Steve had very little time for those elected that failed to represent the people that elected them.
“Never elected himself, Steve often did the work they were meant to. He fought for the poor, the working class, the homeless and the disabled, relentlessly, never giving up.
“He was a hero, someone to look up to, to aspire too, everything he did, he did for free, often wanting nothing in return other than friendship. I often wondered WHY, why he took people like me under his wing, why he fought for the underdog, the hopeless and the helpless when he had very little himself.
“Steve was never a proud or privileged man. He defied the elected, he defied life on many occasions. I, like many others, turned to Steve in my darkest hour, knowing he'd have a listening ear and an open-minded response, never judging or complaining.
“I feel proud and privileged to have known him.
“He was born working class, he lived a working class life, he died working class. He struggled, he fought, fought for what believed in, from the ground up, a lesson to us all that we can do it: we can change the way things are done, our voices do count, we're working class and we matter,” she added.
The service itself was one of mixed emotions – of celebrating the man and his achievements, mourning his loss at just 59 and, among those attending, a palpable sense that they would be spurred on in their own campaigns, inspired by the man who had supported so many of them.
And if Bristol was well-used to hearing Steve in life, they look certain to get used to seeing him or his name in death. Since his death, ‘RIP Steve Norman' has appeared regularly in locations right across the city.
To mark his funeral, a handy ‘cut-out-and-keep' stencil was produced – so expect to see his distinctively uncompromising face with the word ‘disobey' underneath coming to a wall near you soon.
And as the mourners dispersed, to his native Lawrence Weston and Shirehampton for the wake and around the rest of the city, three miles away, a little bit of Steve lived on.
Quietly, unnoticed by the staff inside the M-Shed museum, there's a new addition to the ‘Avonmouth' section of the exhibits telling the story of Bristol's diverse neighbourhoods.
David Copperfield Found Negligent, But Won't Pay For Injury During Magic Act
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Locher/AP John Locher/AP
No doubt, it is something famed illusionist David Copperfield hoped would just go away. However, unlike one of his magic acts, he couldn't just make it disappear with the wave of a hand.
On Tuesday, a jury in Las Vegas found Copperfield negligent, but not financially responsible for an injury suffered by British tourist Gavin Cox, who says he slipped and fell while acting as a "volunteer from the audience" during an illusion in Las Vegas in 2013.
It is a qualified victory for Copperfield, but it still comes at a steep price: his lawyers were unable to prevent the disclosure of secrets about the illusion in question, known as "Lucky #13."
The mechanics of the act seem remarkably pedestrian – as in, it involved a lot of walking (and running) around for those who volunteered to "disappear."
According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, "Cox was among 12 other volunteers who seemed to disappear from Copperfield's elevated stage, when in reality they were whisked off the platform by flashlight-wielding stagehands."
The Associated Press adds that "the randomly chosen participants [were ushered] past dark curtains, down passageways, around corners, outdoors, indoors and through an MGM Grand resort kitchen to re-enter the theater for the show's finale, according to testimony."
At some point during all of that, Cox says he was exhorted by stagehands to "Run! Run! Run!" through an outdoor alleyway coated with construction dust. That's when he slipped and fell.
"I was having a good time up until the time I was injured," he testified.
Cox, 57, a former chef from Kent, England, says he fell hard on his right side and didn't remember getting up to finish the illusion, according to AP. He says he suffered a brain injury and racked up more than $400,000 in medical bills.
He sued not only Copperfield, but MGM Grand hotel, two Copperfield business entities and a construction firm renovating the hotel (apparently, the source of the "construction dust").
Cox's attorney, Benedict Morelli, argued that the Lucky #13 trick was inherently dangerous. Lawyers for Copperfield and MGM workers countered "that Cox had exaggerated his injuries and deceived jurors about suffering from traumatic brain damage. Cox occasionally has walked in and out of court with the assistance of family. Defense attorneys played video of him outside of court, walking unassisted," according to the Review-Journal.
Despite being found negligent, jurors found no liability for Copperfield and the other defendants and that Cox was "100 percent responsible" for his injuries — meaning he cannot seek monetary damages, AP writes.
Copperfield's attorney Elaine Fresch said the result was "the right verdict," according to the Review-Journal, while MGM attorney Jerry Popovich said the verdict "appears to indicate what we had argued, which is this was an unfortunate accident."

WASHINGTON: When black rats invaded Lord Howe Island after the 1918 wreck of the steamship Makambo, they wiped out numerous native species on the small Australian isle in the Tasman Sea including a big, flightless insect that resembled a stick.
But the Lord Howe Island stick insect, once declared extinct, still, lives. Scientists said on Thursday DNA analysis of museum specimens of the bug and a similar-looking one from an inhospitable volcanic outcrop called Ball's Pyramid 14 miles (23 km) away confirmed they are the same species. The finding could help pave the way for its reintroduction in the coming years.
“The Lord Howe Island stick insect has become emblematic of the fragility of island ecosystems. Unlike most stories involving extinction, this one gives us a unique second chance,” said evolutionary biologist Alexander Mikheyev of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University in Japan.
The glossy-black insect that grows up to six inches (15 cm) in length is nicknamed the “land lobster.” Other stick insects are found around the world, so named because their appearance lets them blend in with trees and bushes to evade predators.
As adults, the wingless Lord Howe Island stick insects shelter in trees during daytime and come out at night to eat shrubbery. The bright-green babies are active during daytime.
By about 1930, they had vanished on Lord Howe Island, which was thought to be their only home. There were no land-dwelling mammals there when the rats arrived, and they also vanquished five bird species and 12 other insect species.
A rock-climbing ranger made a curious discovery in 2001 on Ball's Pyramid: a similar-looking insect. Since then, captive breeding programs have begun at the Melbourne Zoo and elsewhere.
Because of certain differences between the Ball's Pyramid insects and the Lord Howe Island insect museum specimens, there was some question about whether they were the same species.
“We found what everyone hoped to find, that despite some significant morphological differences, these are indeed the same species,” said Mikheyev, who led the research published in the journal Current Biology.
Officials are planning a program to eradicate the invasive rats on Lord Howe Island, which could allow the stick insects to return.
“I imagine that maybe a decade from now, people will travel to Lord Howe Island and take night walks, hoping to glimpse this insect,” Mikheyev said. “In maybe 20 years, they could become a ubiquitous sight.”
New Delhi: India`s annual consumer price inflation (CPI) picked up to 2.36 percent in July from 1.46 percent in June, as a decline in food prices slowed sharply, government data showed on Monday.
Revised inflation was 1.46 percent in June, the slowest pace, since India started releasing retail inflation data in January 2012 based on combined data for rural and urban consumers.
Core inflation rate was recorded at 3.9 percent month on month (MoM) in comparison to 3.8 percent month on month (MoM).
India's wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation increased to 1.88 percent in July, led by increases in food and mineral prices, compared to 0.90 percent rise a month ago.

× ‘Giraffe Cam' to be taken down after April suffers leg injury
HARPURSVILLE, N.Y. — Millions have been watching April the giraffe's livestream, but, on Monday, zoo officials said they will pull the video feed after April suffered an injury.
Animal Adventure Park posted on Facebook that, just days after giving birth to her calf, April twisted one of her legs, which zoo officials say is not uncommon with animals her size.
The park added that they've been bogged down with messages about April, which have been affecting their email servers and say it's the reason why they're taking down the “Giraffe Cam.”
As of Monday evening, the livestream was still running.
April has been the subject of international attention since the live feed was turned on in February. On Saturday, after months of anticipation, April gave birth to her fourth calf.
The Animal Adventure Park currently has a contest underway to name the male calf. It costs $1 to cast a vote, and the park says the money will go to three different causes: giraffe conservation, “Ava's Little Heroes” – an event named after the park owners' daughter who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy – and to further improvements at Animal Adventure Park.

“When you saw the two lining up, the hairs on your neck stood up!”
When Burnley's record signing Robbie Brady and his predecessor Jeff Hendrick, stood side by side for the Republic of Ireland in the European Championships, they realised a dream for their former coaches.
Robbie Brady and Jeff Hendrick as youngsters
St Kevin's Boys pair Billy McCornack and Kevin Wallace were at the Aviva Stadium in their home city of Dublin to watch their most prized graduates start alongside each other for the first time since moving on from their schoolboy roots.
The game was a Group D qualifier against Scotland, a fixture in which the duo saw out the 90 minutes in a 1-1 draw in the summer of 2015.
They had played together previously, for Dublin's representative squads, and they had progressed through their country's age groups from being teenagers.
They'd had 20 minutes together in the 7-0 thrashing of Gibraltar in 2014 when Brady replaced Clarets full back Stephen Ward, and they were given the nod by Martin O'Neill in the friendly against England.
But this was different. This was the moment where fantasy became a reality and it had all come together just a stone's throw away from where it had all began.
“It's unbelievable,” said Wallace. “It was so exciting seeing them lining up together against Scotland.
“To see them [involved in the Euros] was fantastic. When you saw the two lining up the hairs on your neck stood up. After all these years to see the two lads together playing for Ireland, it was just fantastic.”
It was just eight months ago when Brady, then at Norwich City, flicked a header past Italy keeper Salvatore Sirigu in a dramatic finale at Stade Pierre-Mauroy to send his nation through to the knockout stages of the Euros.
The versatile left-footer then netted from the spot in the following fixture against hosts France at Parc OL only to see Atletico Madrid striker, and eventual Golden Boot winner, Antoine Griezmann, turn the tie around.
“A few things stood out for me, obviously with Robbie standing up to take a penalty against France,” said McCornack. “Straight away we said he would score because from the age of eight they were taking penalties and we were teaching them. That's the truth, and he never missed a penalty. We were really confident about him.”
He added: “It was a great header [against Italy]. “Even to run from that position he was in and keep going. He doesn't give up until the end and he took the chance to get in-between the defenders. It was a great goal.”
Both McCornack and Wallace were in attendance to see Brady convert a trademark free kick on his home debut at Turf Moor as Sean Dyche's side drew 1-1 with Premier League leaders Chelsea.
“We've kept in touch more with Jeffrey,” added McCornack, the former boss of the schoolboy club. “With Robbie there's been bits and pieces, he invited me over to Manchester United when he was with them and with Jeffrey we went to Derby a lot.
“The two lads have been really good to us that way. They haven't forgotten their roots and where they are from.
“They've done lots for St Kevin's Boys, going back and doing training sessions and functions.”
Hendrick had been hand-picked from the local mini leagues at the age of eight, joining Brady who had represented the club since being five years old.
McCornack and Wallace knew that big things beckoned.
“I first saw Jeffrey in the local mini leagues, I approached his father Billy to see if he'd join St Kevin's Boys and he agreed to come to us,” said McCormac. “He would have been eight.
“Robert was seven. He came through the mini leagues system within St Kevin's Boys itself, he'd been there since he was five.”
Wallace added: “At the time we were struggling behind all schoolboy clubs, such as Home Farm.
“But Kevin's is probably the most successful schoolboy club in Dublin on the back of that team and the two lads doing so well.”
McCormac returned to the conversation: “With Jeffrey, when he came onto the pitch he stood tall, chest out. He was tall and blonde at the time and he stood out for that.
“The first time I saw him play he picked the ball at the back and ran the length of the pitch past everyone and smashed in a shot from 15 yards. I think every single person on the touchline was thinking ‘he's got something'.
“Robert was slightly different. He was trickier, good on the ball, great left foot. He had more individual skill. We saw the prospect was there.
“They were great and worked very hard. Their work ethic from being eight or nine was amazing.”
Wallace finished: “I think they're going to be the mainstay of Ireland for years to come, and hopefully for Burnley.”
With warmer weather in sight, Ridgefield is rapidly approaching the time of year where homeowners and businesses start making plans for outdoor landscaping projects, home improvements, and property repairs.
While it is recognized that owners wish to enhance their properties, it is also necessary that the property enhancements cause no harm to the environment.
Inland Wetlands Agent Beth Peyser and Zoning Enforcement Officer Richard Baldelli believe that by having the property owners and the town working together, property enhancements can be accomplished without having a negative environmental impact.
There are unique landscape attributes within the Town of Ridgefield that include a wide variety of inland wetlands, ponds, brooks, streams, rivers, and lakes. These natural resources are regulated and monitored by the Town of Ridgefield through the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations (IWWR). These IWWR regulations, in addition to regulating activities within the wetlands and watercourses, also contain “upland review areas” from wetlands, waterbodies, or watercourses. The upland review area is a regulated zone beyond the edge of the wetlands and watercourses. A property owner may conduct a landscaping project, home improvement or property repair within this “upland review area” only after an Inland Wetlands Application has been submitted and approved and a Wetlands Permit has been issued. Any earth disturbance within the upland review area, wetland, waterbody, or watercourse is a regulated activity.
Examples of regulated activities are: filling, grading, installation of walls, patios, parking area, etc.
Flood hazard area
In addition to wetlands and watercourses, there is a substantial amount of floodplain that is designated as Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
Pursuant to the delegation from the State of Connecticut and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Planning and Zoning Commission regulates these areas to aid in preventing damage from floods. The Town of Ridgefield Zoning Regulations have been amended and updated according to these Floodplain Management Regulations.
The Floodplain Management Regulations require a Site Plan Approval for Floodplain Development for any development activity performed within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). A Floodplain development is defined as: any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to: filling, grading, paving, excavation, construction, structures within a floodplain, etc.
Under almost no circumstances will a development activity that would result in an increase in flood level, or act as an impediment within the SFHA, be permitted.
In May 2016, the Planning and Zoning Commission adopted Drainage Requirements and Stormwater Management Regulations. These regulations may be applicable to a site improvement that includes the installation of any new impervious surfaces — patios, decks, pools, etc. The regulations may also be applied to excavation, filling or grading, including minor improvements to property.
Peyser and Baldelli are requesting that anyone, with any questions regarding a property enhancement activity, within or near a lakeside community, wetland, waterbody, or watercourse, or if resident have any questions regarding what is an inland wetland, waterbody, watercourse, or floodplain, contact them.
Peyser can be reached at [email protected] or by calling 203-431-2383. Richard Baldelli's can be reached at [email protected] or by calling 203-431-2768.

Southampton boss Claude Puel admitted Saints' New Year's day collapse was simply one game too far for his exhausted players.
Saints had looked on course for a gritty point at Everton in a tense game with few chances for both sides, but then fell apart when they conceded three goals in the last 17 minutes.
And the French coach insisted a Christmas programme that has seen them play three games in six days was simply too punishing for a side that has endured a heavy cup programme this season.
“We start the season with many games – European games – we've played every three days and sometimes every two days and always without recovery for my players,” he said.
“We had a list like Real Madrid and Barcelona, but not their squad. Just since Boxing Day we have played three games in five days and we tried to give a good answer, but its impossible. We did for 70 minutes, but we couldn't give a good answer in the end.”

Enner Valencia proved the difference between the two sides as he sprang from the bench to start the collapse with his first goal from Everton.
But Puel believes his team now have the chance to restore their confidence after this bruising defeat, with an FA Cup visit to Norwich then an EFL semi-final against Liverpool, and he added: “You can sense sometimes a loss of confidence because we are in a difficult situation, of course it is always difficult but it is a good experience for this young squad.
“It is important to protect them now, and help them recover. But they were courageous, and they will improve from this.”
The White House considers Gov. John Hickenlooper a potential challenger to President Donald Trump in 2020 and has hired consultants to “scour” his background, according to a report in the New York Post.
The story by Post reporter Aaron Short relies on anonymous sources “close to the administration,” and has the salacious whiff of a tabloid expose, but it also appears to have set off a Twitter spat on Sunday morning between Trump and brash billionaire Mark Cuban, one of the other three “outspoken Democrats” pegged along with Hickenlooper.
Chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, the former Brietbart News publisher credited with resurrecting Trump's campaign when he took over as CEO last summer, is supposed to have tasked consultants with investigating Hickenlooper, Cuban and two Democratic senators, Ohio's Sherrod Brown — think Columbo without the raincoat — and Connecticut's Chris Murphy, a young thorn in the Republican administration's side.
“The White House political department wants people to start looking into them,” a source close to the White House told the Post, adding, “Trump is obsessed with running for re-election.”
Some names were prominent by their absence from the list, Short wrote, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — “too old” — and both New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, because they've supposedly been “tainted by corruption.”
Among the four potential challengers, Hickenlooper and Brown were both said to have been on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's short list for vice president. (Hickenlooper, Brown, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Warren, Booker, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro reportedly went through a grueling vetting process and met with Clinton right before she announced Kaine was her pick.)
The Post's sources say Murphy and Brown are seen as “viable threats,” with the ability to kick-start fundraising and rapidly assemble an army of supporters.
Hickenlooper “is seen as a less-combative rising star,” the Post reports.
Short's account reserves the most ink for a discussion of Cuban, considered the White House's “biggest fear” because his appeal — like Trump's — can cross-party lines. “He's not the typical candidate,” a second source quoth, noting that the reality TV star and Dallas Mavericks owner could pony up some serious cash for a run.
The tabloid's portrayal of the Cuban threat, so to speak, might have irked Trump, who fired off an insulting tweet before dawn on Sunday.
“I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls. He's not smart enough to run for president!” Trump wrote.
Cuban replied to Trump's tweet with a succinct “LOL” about a half hour later. About an hour after that, he tweeted that he had no idea what had prompted Trump's attack: “I don't know. But isn't it better for all of us that he is tweeting rather than trying to govern?”
As for Hickenlooper's spot on the select White House target list, the governor didn't appear to be too concerned — he was traveling on official business in California and unavailable for comment, said a spokeswoman, and probably hadn't even seen the Post report.
But even a “less-combative” challenger has a background worth scouring, right?
Except that Hickenlooper hasn't ever hidden the fact he's exceedingly human — the word “quirky” was officially banished years ago from any Hickenlooper coverage because of its omnipresence — and that's a key element in his appeal.
Bannon's minions could save a lot of legwork by ordering a copy of the governor's candid — some would say bracingly refreshing — memoir, “The Opposite of Woe: My Life in Beer and Politics,” co-written with former speechwriter Maximillian Potter and published last spring. (Spoiler: the title refers to a favorite Hickenlooper joke, and the answer is “giddyup.”) A highlighter will come in handy as Hickenlooper recounts marital woes, his experiences smoking pot and the nude selfie he once took in a bathtub. And then there was the time he took his mother to see the X-rated movie “Deep Throat.”
Suffice it to say that the Trump team will be able to find plenty of oppo research about Hickenlooper — maybe even the Running of the Pigs and the fancy suits he tried on when he was running for mayor — but they might also find that it isn't any secret.

Constructs Products to hold Dominance through 2025
The global expanded perlite market can be studied on the basis of application and geography. The key application segments of the global expanded perlite market are construction products, filler, horticulture aggregates, filtration and process aids, and others. Construction products application segment holds dominance in terms of consumption amongst all. As a result, the demand from construction products attracts the leading revenue over other application segments. Firstly, the light weight and superior insulation properties of expanded perlite finds application for loose-fill insulation in masonry construction. Some other advantages of expanded perlite include enhancement of fire ratings, filling cavity of concrete block, and reducing noise transmissions.
Horticulture is also emerging to be a promising application segment of expanded perlite. Rising demand for greenhouse horticulture to serve the increasing demand for quality fruits and vegetables is fueling the demand for expanded perlite for the manufacture of green roof. Not only this, the excellent water retention properties of expanded perlite that helps to provide aeration and optimum moisture retention for plant growth has helped improve crop yield. This factor is also benefitting the expanded perlite market.

Trump Calls Out KKK, White Supremacists After Charlottesville: 'Racism Is Evil'
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images
Updated at 2:30 p.m. ET
Almost 48 hours after violence engulfed Charlottesville, Va., President Trump called out white nationalist groups by name. Trump's remarks on Monday followed criticism that his initial statement about the clash of protesters did not condemn racist groups specifically.
"Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans," the president said from the White House.
Trump began his remarks talking about his economic accomplishments and plans for trade negotiations before turning his attention to the events over the weekend in Virginia. After the Charlottesville City Council had voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from one of its parks, white nationalists groups — including white supremacists, the alt-right, the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis — descended on the city for a "Unite the Right" rally.
On Friday night, they marched on the normally sleepy college town, home to the University of Virginia, carrying torches. On Saturday conditions turned deadly as hundreds of the white nationalists, some carrying Confederate flags and shields and others in militia-like gear, clashed with counterprotesters in the city streets.
At one point a silver Dodge Challenger, allegedly driven by 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio, rammed into a street filled with counterprotesters. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed, and at least 19 others were injured. Fields was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and run.
President Trump expressed sympathy to Heyer's family, as well as to the families of Virginia State Troopers Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Berke M.M. Bates, who died when their helicopter that was patrolling Saturday's event crashed.
"These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation," Trump said. "In times such as these, America has always shown its true character, responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice."
Trump spoke after meeting with newly installed FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the White House. He said that the Department of Justice had opened a civil rights investigation into the car attack.
"To anyone who acted criminally at this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered," the president said.
Sessions told ABC News on Monday morning that the car crash that had killed Heyer "does meet the definition of domestic terrorism."
"You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is unequivocally an unacceptable, evil attack," he said.
The president's condemnations may be too little too late for those who criticized Trump's initial remarks — and Trump may have missed a critical moment to be the nation's healer-in-chief. On Saturday, Trump claimed that the clashes were a result of "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides." Top Republicans, among others, quickly criticized him for not calling out by name the white supremacists, alt-right, KKK and neo-Nazi groups who began the protests.
"Mr. President – we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism," Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who heads up the GOP Senate campaign committee, tweeted on Saturday.
The White House put out an unsigned statement on Sunday morning, saying that, "The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred and of course that includes white Supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together."
Vice President Pence had gone further than the president in his own comments, telling reporters Sunday night while traveling in Colombia, "We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms."
Trump has been blamed for being slow to criticize white supremacist groups in the past — even as he regularly attacks other targets on Twitter. During the 2016 campaign, Trump came under fire for not immediately disavowing the endorsement of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard.
Duke, who attended the march in Virginia, said on Saturday that participants' aim was "to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That's what we believed in. That's why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he's going to take our country back."
Duke later responded to one of the president's tweets condemning the violence by saying, "I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists."

DALLAS, Tx. - No, this isn't a fight breaking out at Comic Con.
"It`s more of a women`s empowerment type of event worked in with self defense against common attacks today on women," says Michelle Manu, instructor of SHE or the Super Hero Experience. It's one of the events hosted by the Chamberlain Studios of Self Defense this weekend.
"Training and Dojo etiquette for martial artists doesn`t prepare us for what`s about to come at us on the street, for instance, I was confronted with a hammer," explains Manu.
That`s not something you might see in every self defense class... neither are these costumes!
"This is not learning how to kick and punch, this is learning about how to asses a situation - do you even know what you`re going to do? If you see blood whether it`s your or the opponent will you freak out and freeze or will you keep going? These are things that we have to mentally prepare for."
And that`s not the only difference at this Hawaiian themed event.
"So part of the Hula move is kind of this." Then she puts the moves into action.
As for the message for these Sheroes...
"It`s important for me, for women to remember who they are. Somehow in society we`ve forgotten how very powerful we are."
She doesn't mean flying or laser beam powers.
"I`ve learned that I`m very powerful but I`m not blind to societal impacts of what we`re supposed to be as women and what`s expected of us, but I will not dim myself."
Nothing 'dim' about tossing an attacker to the ground!
SHARON, Mass. (AP) — Ahmad Alkhalaf has had a busy year.
He attended Democratic President Barack Obama's final State of the Union address as a special guest of a congressman. He learned to bike and rollerblade, took martial arts and gymnastics classes and spent his summer playing soccer and swimming in a lake at a day camp in the Boston suburbs.
And he received his first pair of prosthetic arms after his were blown off three years ago in a refugee camp bomb blast that also killed three of his siblings.
But as the 11-year-old Syrian boy looks to another year in his adopted home, he says his dream is to be reunited with his mother and four surviving siblings, who are living in Istanbul.

“I want my mom to come here,” he said on a recent Saturday as he kicked around a soccer ball in a park. “I feel like I'm losing her. It's been too long. I can't take it anymore.”
Ahmad's father, Dirgam Alkhalaf, said those hopes largely hinge on whether Republican President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his pledge to curtail the flow of Syrians and Muslims to the U.S.
Alkhalaf has applied for asylum and hopes to petition for the rest of the family if he and Ahmad are permitted to stay.
“I can only be hopeful he'll do the right thing,” Alkhalaf said of Trump through an interpreter. “No matter what people say, I'm optimistic.”
Trump transition team officials didn't return emails seeking comment on the family's case.
Alkhalaf said he can't return to Turkey after renouncing his temporary residency status there. Returning to Syria, where the Sunni Muslim family lived just outside the battle-scarred city of Aleppo, also isn't an option.
“There is nothing left in Syria for us. Our home is destroyed; the government is out to get us,” he said, referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, which he says conducted the 2013 bombing. “I've got nowhere to go if the U.S. doesn't want me.”
The father and son have been living among a rotating group of Muslim families since their arrival in June 2015 on a medical visa for Ahmad.
Alkhalaf works as a security guard at a mosque after receiving his work permit in July. He hopes to take his driver's license exam soon.
The emotional strain of separation has taken its toll on the family, Alkhalaf said.
His youngest son in Turkey has developed asthma-like problems, his wife is being treated for high blood pressure and Ahmad doesn't always sleep well, a problem that started with night terrors following the bomb blasts.
“Emotionally, I'm drained,” Alkhalaf said. “If we were all together, I think a lot of us would feel better. It's half the battle.”
Ahmad talks with his mother often and knows she's struggling to provide for his siblings. The family largely lives off the charity of the Muslim community in New England and what Alkhalaf can send from his wages.
Ahmad said he tries to perk his mother up by telling her about the new things he's experiencing.
“I try to make her happy, but it's hard,” Ahmad said.
He enrolled in the fourth grade this past fall at a school in the Boston suburbs. He is awaiting a more advanced pair of prosthetic arms. And he hopes to join a soccer team this spring.
Officials at Heights Elementary say Ahmad's stresses haven't appeared to affect his schooling. If anything, they say, they're impressed with how quickly he has embraced his new environment, where he is receiving physical and occupational therapy, one-on-one reading and math help and other support.
“He really wants to talk to people and understand things on many levels,” said Holly Geiger, Ahmad's teacher. “He's not shy, and I think that's helped.”
Supporters have purposely jam-packed Ahmad's schedule, said Nabil Jalal, a Sharon resident who is among those helping Ahmad and his father.
As Ahmad ran off to join an arts and craft session, Jalal worried what the new year might bring.
“You can't have one parent and not the other, no matter how good the life is here,” Jalal said. “There's a big missing part.”

Medical tourism is one of the most dynamically growing industries today. Considered to be the direct impact of globalisation of healthcare, medical tourism certainly exhibits strong growth potential globally. However, based on FMI's research, the market of medical tourism is expected to concentrate within most of the emerging economies of the world.
As developing nations are increasingly heading toward technological advancement and quality services in the medical and healthcare sector, the global medical tourism market is anticipated to witness robust growth over 2014-2020, predominantly in Asian countries.
The top treatments people travel abroad for, include cancer therapy, cardiovascular surgeries, orthopaedic treatments, dentistry, cosmetic surgeries, reproductive treatments, weight loss therapies, health screenings, and medical tests and scans. In severe cases, a sizeable patient population also seeks second opinion from specialist doctors out of their countries.
Request Sample Report @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-249
Key Drivers
High treatment costs and lengthy waiting times for medical procedures, being the two major factors in driving medical tourism, are also supported by easier and cheaper international travel. While the U.K.'s population prefers to travel abroad for bypassing long waits, patients from the U.S. travel outside for availing of treatments at cheaper costs.
Medical excellence along with international accreditation are the key factors fuelling a majority of international patient flow, eventually boosting international medical tourism. Currently, over 600 medical departments and hospitals all over the globe are accredited by the U.S. Joint Commission International (JCI). The number of accredited facilities is projected to increase almost by 20% each year. This is another important driver associated with the market growth.
Developing countries, with ever-evolving innovation and demonstrable achievements in medical research are estimated to accelerate the approaching medical tourist flow over the forecast period. Growing healthcare investments by various government and private sectors are also anticipated to further bolster the market growth.
Key Restraints
However, medical tourists are highly prone to a wide variety of health risks after they return. The conditions may include TB, paratyphoid, amoebic dysentery, deep vein thrombosis, and more; usually caused due to poor post-operative care and inadequate rest. This could affect the market to some extent.
Stringent documentation processes, issues related to visa approval, and limited insurance coverage are reportedly some of the most deterring factors for the global market.
Global Medical Tourism Market: Segmentation
FMI's research on the global medical tourism market offers a six-year forecast, segmenting the market on the basis of type of medical treatment and geography.
On the basis of the type of treatment, the market is segmented into cosmetic treatment, cardiovascular treatment, fertility treatment, dental treatment, orthopaedic treatment, and other general treatments.
On the basis of geography, the market is segmented into Asia pacific, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, and South America.
Request Report toc @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/toc/rep-gb-249
Regional Outlook
Some of the prominent medical tourism centres across the globe include Thailand, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Israel, Brazil, Turkey, the Philippines, Dubai, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Canada, and the U.S. According to Patients Beyond Borders, the global medical tourism market is currently growing at an impressive rate between 15% and 25%, and the flow of patients seeking cross-border treatment options will be the highest in Mexico. South and Southeast Asia are expected to dominate the global market in the near future.
Based on MTA's recently released Medical Tourism Index, there are 41 countries participating in the global medical tourism market. While India broadly secures #1, Israel ranks #1 in the quality of services and facilities.
India is renowned for specialist cardiac surgeries, while Singapore is a popular medical tourism destination owing to the expertise in complicated surgical procedures. Thailand has been a popular destination for medical tourism and millions of patients have travelled to Thailand since 2006. It is also the top cosmetic surgery centre globally.
Malaysia offers state-of-the-art medical infrastructure and treatments by highly skilled medical professionals, making it another sought after centre among medical tourists. With economically affordable treatment options and favourable government initiatives, Malaysia is anticipated to acquire one of the top market positions in the global medical tourism market, during the forecast period.
Key Players: Global Medical Tourism Market
Some of the top key players in the medical tourism industry include Asian Heart Institute (India), Apollo Hospitals (India), Prince Court Medical Centre (Malaysia), Gleneagles Hospital (Singapore), Min-Sheng General Hospital (Taiwan), Samitivej Sukhumvit Hospital (Bangkok), Raffles Medical Group (Singapore), Clemenceau Medical Centre (Lebanon), Bangkok Hospital (Thailand), Bumrungrad International Hospital (Thailand), Fortis Healthcare Ltd. (India), Wooridul Spine Hospital (Korea), KPJ Healthcare Berhad (Malaysia), Anadolu Medical Centre (Turkey), and Asklepios Klinik Barmbek (Germany).
While these players rank amongst they compete on the basis of exceptional service quality, optimum patient comfort, and relatively reasonable costs for various treatments. Several facilities are also undergoing mergers, acquisitions, affiliations, and joint ventures for delivering enhanced medical care, thereby strengthening their market positions. A few prominent examples of highly productive collaborations include the collaboration between Bumrungrad International Hospital (Bangkok) and IBM Watson for better cancer care, and the collaboration of Anadolu Medical Centre (Turkey) with Johns Hopkins Medicine (U.S.).
Nonprofit Working To Block Drug Imports Has Ties To Pharma Lobby
Enlarge this image toggle caption Bill Diodato/Getty Images Bill Diodato/Getty Images
A nonprofit organization that has orchestrated a wide-reaching campaign against foreign drug imports has deep ties to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, the powerful lobbying group that includes Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Bayer.
The nonprofit, called the Partnership for Safe Medicines, has recently emerged as a leading voice against Senate bills that would allow drugs to be imported from Canada.
Both the lobbying group and the nonprofit partnership have gone to great lengths to show that drugmakers are not driving what they describe as a grass-roots effort to fight imports, including an expensive advertising blitz and an event last week that featured high-profile former FBI officials and a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner.
However, a Kaiser Health News analysis of groups involved in the partnership shows more than one-third have received PhRMA funding or are local chapters of groups that have received PhRMA funding, according to PhRMA tax disclosures from 2013 to 2015.
Forty-seven of the organizations listed in the ads appear to be advocacy organizations that received no money from PhRMA in those years.
A PhRMA senior vice president, Scott LaGanga, previously led the Partnership for Safe Medicines for 10 years. At PhRMA, LaGanga was responsible for the lobbying group's alliances with patient advocacy groups, and he was simultaneously listed as the executive director of the Partnership for Safe Medicines on each of that group's annual tax filings since 2007, the earliest year for which they are available from ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer.
LaGanga wrote a 2011 article about the partnership's origins. Published in the Journal of Commercial Biotechnology, it described "public-private partnerships in addressing counterfeit medicines." His PhRMA job was not disclosed in the article.
From 2010 to 2014, the organization hosted a conference called the Partnership for Safe Medicines Interchange. In a video from a 2013 event, LaGanga thanks pharmaceutical companies, most of them PhRMA members, for sponsoring the event.
In February, LaGanga moved to a senior role at PhRMA and stepped down as executive director of the Partnership for Safe Medicines, just as the group's campaign to stop import legislation was revving up.
The partnership's new executive director, Shabbir Safdar, said LaGanga resigned from the group to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.
"That's why Scott's not executive director anymore," he said. PhRMA declined to make LaGanga available for an interview.
Considering Legislation
The Senate push to allow Americans to buy pharmaceuticals from Canada comes as more patients balk at filling prescriptions because of soaring drug prices. Prescription medicines purchased in the U.S. can run three times what they cost in Canada, data from the company PharmacyChecker.com show.
In 2016, about 19 million Americans purchased pharmaceuticals illegally from foreign sources through online pharmacies or while traveling, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Many survey respondents cited pricing disparities as the reason.
A bill cosponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would provide a mechanism for Canadian drug manufacturers to sell to U.S. consumers and pharmacies. Sanders introduced the bill in February. In January, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also introduced a bill to allow drug imports from Canada.
In the House, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) introduced a similar bill to Sanders', along with 23 other Democrats.
The U.S. drug industry has strongly opposed efforts to open the borders to drug imports, but the PhRMA lobbying group is not mentioned in the nonprofit partnership's recent advertising blitz against the proposed legislation. The nonprofit says its grass-roots effort is supported by 170 members, including professional organizations and trade groups.
The nonprofit describes PhRMA as a dues-paying member with no larger role in shaping the group's activities. Partnership spokeswoman Clare Krusing would not say how much each member contributes. PhRMA spokeswoman Allyson Funk declined to say whether PhRMA funds the partnership.
"PhRMA engages with stakeholders across the health care system to hear their perspectives and priorities," Funk said. "We work with many organizations with which we have both agreements and disagreements on public policy issues, and believe engagement and dialogue are critical."
Campaigning Against Drug Imports
The partnership recently launched its ad campaign, warning against the alleged dangers of legalizing Canadian drug imports. It includes television commercials, promoted search results on Google and a full-page print ad in The Washington Post and The Hill. The group's YouTube page shows recent commercials targeted to viewers in 13 states.
"We don't disclose specific ad figures, but the campaign is in the high six figures," Safdar said.
The commercials ask voters to urge their senators to "oppose dangerous drug importation legislation."
The newspaper ad reads, "Keep the nation's prescription drug supply safe. Urge the Senate to reject drug importation measures." Its headline declares that "170 healthcare advocacy groups oppose drug importation," noting a letter to Congress signed by its members. The ad lists 160 members who signed the letter, and PhRMA's name is not included.
"Having a big membership allows the coalition to present what looks like a unified show of grass-roots support ... but it does raise questions about which members of the coalition are really driving and funding the group's policy-making," said Matthew McCoy, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania who studies patient advocacy groups.
The list of groups includes at least 64 trade organizations representing the biomedical industry, professional associations representing pharmacists, a private research company and two insurance companies.
One group that signed the letter, the "Citrus Council, National Kidney Foundation of Florida Inc.," represents a single volunteer, according to an email from the group. A spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation of Florida said the volunteer's views contradict the position of the umbrella group, and said the foundation supports "any sort of drug importation that allows our patients to have access to drugs at the best price."
Two of the hepatitis patients' advocacy groups that were listed, the National Association of Hepatitis Task Forces and the California Hepatitis C Task Force, are run by the same person, Bill Remak. Remak said the groups receive small amounts of PhRMA funding.
"I don't enjoy having to take this extreme position of saying we shouldn't import at all, but until we have some oversight regime, some way of protecting consumers, it's a really tough call," he said.
"Current drug importation proposals do not appear to have equal safety and chain-of-custody accountability laid out adequately for patient safety concerns," said William Arnold, president of the Community Access National Network, which is also listed in the ad and is an advocacy and support group for people living with HIV/AIDS or hepatitis in Washington, D.C. His group did not accept money from PhRMA between 2013 to 2015, the Kaiser Health News analysis found.
Concerns About Safety And Price
Last week, the partnership hosted a panel at the National Press Club featuring former FBI director Louis Freeh and former FDA commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach. The discussion focused on the alleged health and legal dangers of online pharmacies.
"You can talk about lowering prices, but if a drug comes with a high probability of toxicity and death, that comes at a high cost to the patient," von Eschenbach said. "That's what's at issue with drug importation."
Each speaker argued that the bill co-sponsored by Sanders would be harmful to patients. Around the same time that bill was introduced, the partnership also sent emails to member organizations seeking help to stop such a measure.
Speakers at the partnership event claimed importation would lead to a flood of counterfeit medicines laced with arsenic, fentanyl and lead paint.
"These drugs are manufactured in jungles, in tin drums, in basements. ... Those are the sort of sanitary conditions we're talking about here," said George Karavetsos, a former director of the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations.
Both von Eschenbach and Karavetsos have ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Von Eschenbach left the FDA in 2009 to join Greenleaf Health, which counsels pharmaceutical clients, before starting his own consulting company, and Karavetsos counsels pharmaceutical clients at DLA Piper, a Washington, D.C., law firm.
In an interview, Josh Miller-Lewis, Sanders' deputy director of communications, refuted Karavetsos' arguments. He said Canadian drugmakers can apply for licenses, and all drugs would have to come from FDA-inspected plants.
Politico reported in October that PhRMA is bolstering its war chest by another $100 million per year, suggesting to many industry analysts that drugmakers are gearing up for a ferocious fight.
"I think it's safe to say pharmaceutical corporations are prepared to spend some fraction of their multibillion-dollar profits to fight drug importation and any other policy that might end the plague of overpriced medicine," said Rick Claypool, research director for Public Citizen, a watchdog group critical of the drug industry.

He held it together as he reminisced about the Busby Babes and how great they would have become had tragedy not cut them down in their prime.
But when he recalled the coffins of his Manchester United team-mates returning to Old Trafford, the glint in Wilf McGuinness 's eyes was replaced by an aching sadness as he fought back tears.
“Even now, it's very difficult,” said McGuinness, reflecting on the Munich air disaster of 1958, which claimed the lives of eight United players and 23 people in total.
McGuinness, 20 at the time, missed the trip because he was injured, having travelled abroad with Sir Matt Busby's United squad on all of their previous European Cup ties that season.
“I was very fortunate to be injured, because I'd been on every trip, and it will never, ever stay out of mind,” recalled McGuinness, ahead of Tuesday's 60th anniversary of the crash.

“It's the No.1 thing that's in my mind - those wonderful lads. The worst experience ever was the plane crash, when players died and some never played again.
“Thinking about how great they were will always stay in my mind. They were extra special and so young when they died.
“They would have been the best-ever United team and they would have won everything.
“The sad thing is there wasn't enough film or footage of them. The fans of today missed them.
“Those players who died were magnificent, some of the best players the club has ever had.
“It was a terrible, terrible time. It was like being in a fog when it happened.
“You think of the ones that went. You don't think of yourself escaping or not going on the trip.
“I'd been on every trip, as a reserve, really, because Eddie Colman and Duncan Edwards were the wing-halves, who were ahead of me.

“They were magnificent players. Eddie was a Salford lad, a great player and my best pal.
“But Duncan was the best player, strong, with legs like tree trunks. He could hit long balls and short balls – he had everything.”
United were back playing 10 days after the tragedy, a team made up largely of reserve and youth team players beating Sheffield Wednesday 3-0 in an FA Cup tie.
“Some clubs would have gone under,” said McGuinness. “But we had a great youth team and had to bring some of those young lads through early, and bring in some players on loan.”
The tragedy took a huge toll on those who survived it, including United great Sir Bobby Charlton, with the coping mechanism back then simply not to talk about what had happened.
There were no grief counsellors to help them through the trauma and McGuinness admitted the tragedy was off-limits when those players who had survived returned to the fold.

“Obviously we didn't talk about it with them,” said McGuinness, who attended every funeral of his team-mates who died in Munich. “It was mentioned, but only when it had to be
“There must have been many a tear shed, but not openly. They had to carry on. What else could they do?
“Bobby was always a quiet lad, but it knocked him for six. He was a long time ago, but I think about it and I wasn't even on the plane.
“So imagine what they were thinking, the ones who survived?”
Winning the European Cup in 1968, a decade later, provided some form of closure for United, finally laying their hands on the trophy the Busby Babes had set out to win before tragedy struck.
“That helped tremendously and we did think of the players we'd lost,” said McGuinness, by then a member of United's coaching staff after injury forced him to retire at just 22.
“We thought ‘this is for them', not for us. It was special. They made Manchester United, those lads who died that terrible day.”

Thanks to the sweltering heat wave, the Met Office have had to warn sufferers of uncomfortably high pollen levels.
It's not just been a case of hay fever symptoms causing discomfort. Worryingly, asthma helplines have seen a surge in calls.
With the hot weather set to continue, it could mean the end isn't quite in sight for hayfever sufferers who have to turn to antihistamines and other remedies to combat the effects.
One young woman plagued by the misery of hay fever recently turned to her boyfriend for sympathy and help.
And he cheekily proposed a rather X-rated cure.
20-year-old Lois White isn't your average hay fever sufferer. She's had an allergic reaction so strong she's effectively become housebound.
(Image: dropdeadlois/Twitter)
It's got so bad that she's been waking up in the morning with "eyes swollen" and her "throat closed" and has had to call in sick at work.
But at least her boyfriend is on her side.
He sent her a text in which he'd claimed to have "done some research" on home remedies,and informed her that anal sex "is the best thing" for hay fever.
In case you're wondering, this is not true or backed up by science.
(Image: dropdeadlois/Twitter)
Lois later shared the loving text message exchange on Twitter, explaining how she was "nearly done with him tbh."
We could be wrong, but we somehow don't think severe hay fever is one of nature's aphrodisiacs.

It remains one of the most enduring reality TV shows.
And, each year, thousands of self-promoting people compete to be part of Channel 5's Big Brother .
Together, the lure of low-level fame, humiliating tasks and £65,000 prize money draws applications from across the UK.
Last year, tanning addict Isabelle Warburton scooped the prize and made history in the process. She became the first woman to enter the house late and triumph in the final.
But how can you be part of it?
(Image: BACKGRID)
The first step is to stop procrastinating.
The application process for 2018 has already started and is now in full swing.To start, make a video and save it onto your computer or mobile device.
"You should try to get the essence of your personality across in your video and what it is about you that would make the perfect housemate," the official BB site says.
"There are no rules about what you should include but you've only got one chance to show us who you are and what you are about – so make it count. Please note there should be no copyrighted music."
Then, armed with two pictures of yourself, fill in this application form and submit them alongside the video.

But be warned: there are caveats. You must be 18 years of age by July 31 2018 and you must have the right to reside in the UK or the Republic of Ireland.
This is the initial stage completed.
If successful, you'll receive a phone call and be invited to meet with producers.
Not heard by May 2018? Then it's safe to assume you've not been shortlisted for the next series.
File photo of farmers protesting in Maharashtra. The protest was called by the steering committee of farmers' organizations to demand a blanket farm loan waiver. Photo: PTI
Mumbai: The “road blockade” called by a host of farmers' organizations in Maharashtra on Monday evoked a modest response in some parts of the state.
The protest was called by the steering committee of farmers' organizations to demand a blanket farm loan waiver, higher minimum support prices for all farm produce as per the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, and waiver of electricity charges for farmers.
However, the day also saw differences crop up between some organizations over the strategy of protest on 15 August.
Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana founder Raju Shetty, MP, said that his organization would not participate in the protest on 15 August as it was “the Independence Day, which must be celebrated with joy by all including farmers”.
The steering committee, especially the Bharatiya Kisan Sabha which is affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has called for a protest on 15 August and urged farmers not to allow district guardian ministers to hoist the national flag.
The Kisan Kranti Samiti of Puntamba village in Ahmednagar district, which had given the original call for a farmers' strike in June, also distanced itself from the protest saying all the current leaders of the steering committee were pushing farmers deeper in trouble for their politics.
“The leaders of the steering committee only give fiery speeches that instigate young farmers who resort to violence and who as a result face police cases. The leaders themselves stay away at a safe distance,” said Kisan Kranti member Sandip Gidde.
In Sangli and Solapur districts of western Maharashtra, farmers blocked roads at several points demanding a complete loan waiver. In Sangli, farmers staged protests at eight places and the police detained many protestors including former legislator Sharad Patil. Maadha, Malshiras, and Pandharpur tehsils of Solapur also saw protests.
In Nashik district, protestors blocked Nashik-Surat highway for a couple of hours at Dindori. Protesters also blocked the Nagpur Aurangabad highway in Buldhana district of Vidarbha.
In Buldhana, the protest was led by Raju Shetty. Shetty said the government needed to announce a complete farm loan waiver immediately and do away with the cumbersome procedures for applying for partial farm loan waiver and the crop insurance scheme.

DRAMA students from Year 11 at Byron High School will challenge audiences to think deeply with their new production of the play 100.
Playing next Wednesday, June 21 and Friday, June 23 at the school's performing arts centre, the premise of the play is to imagine eternity will not wait forever. The students, along with newly appointed drama teacher Simone Museth, have been working hard on the production over the past three months.
"Audiences will be challenged to think deeply about what is essential to us as human beings in our own lives," Ms Museth said.
"Imagine you must choose one single memory from your entire life and capture it with a magical camera - everything else will be erased from your life forever.
"Imagine that choosing this memory is your only way of passing through into eternity.
"You have to the count of 100 to decide."
The play, originally written by C Heinmann, NMonaghan and D Petterle and produced by "theimaginarybody" UK, first premiered at the 2002 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, winning a Fringe First award.
Critics praised the play, saying, "The beauty of this play is in its simple premise and the purity of its execution."
In the words of Christopher Heinmann, the setting for 100 is "a fluid interchange between a magical void space between life and death where the characters struggle to choose, and the worlds inside their memories".
Ms Museth said the school's innovative interpretation of the script echoed the styles of physical theatre and magical realism, as the talented cast and crew continually transform themselves and the scenes on stage, with minimal props or set items.
Performances begin at 7.30pm sharp on both nights, with tickets available from the school on 66858188, or limited numbers can be purchased at the door. Adult $10, student/concession $5 and family of four $25.
All they have is a photo from the 1970s, a nickname, and social media – but the veterans from one Vietnam War platoon are hoping that will be enough to track down the buddy they called “Louisiana.”
Posting from her husband's Vietnam reunion earlier this month, Susan Waldrop Garvin posted the photo of the man, taken in 1970 or 1971 when his friends estimate he was 18 to 20 years old, and what his buddies remembered about him: his dark curly hair, the necklace he wore along with his dog tags, the fact that he had so many nicknames they don't even know if they ever knew his real name—and that, due to his main nickname, they think he may have hailed from Louisiana.
“He was a grunt on the ground in Vietnam. ARMY infantry; D Company; 2/8th CAVALRY; Range platoons in Vietnam,” she wrote, pleading for anyone who might recognize him to come forward
The post also included a video (viewed more than 170, 000 times so far, Garvin says) of three of his buddies talking about how much they miss him and want to track him down.
Garvin's husband Jim, who took the photograph, says he takes it to every reunion he attends and everyone remembers Louisiana, but no one has been able to identify him. That post has been shared more than 130,000 times, and Garvin has made subsequent posts as news organizations have picked up the story.
“We just remember that the picture represents the beautiful grin that he had almost all the time,” Jim Garvin tells WBRZ. To WWL-TV, he adds that Louisiana was “a very jovial and lighthearted person and kind of lifted the spirits of the rest of the troops.” ”
He was just a very happy-go-lucky, very positive individual,” he tells NBC DFW. He adds that attending reunions can be “healing” for vets, and he hopes Louisiana can make it to one.

President Donald Trump has waded in on the furore over a racist tweet by TV star Roseanne Barr. Picture: Patrick Semansky/AP
Los Angeles - US President Donald Trump waded into the uproar over Roseanne Barr's racist tweet, complaining that an ABC TV executive who apologized for the comments had turned a deaf ear to criticism of him broadcast by the network.
Barr sparked widespread anger with a tweet comparing Valerie Jarrett, an adviser to President Barack Obama, to an ape. Barr wrote in a now-deleted message that if the Islamist political movement "muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj."
The tweet led Walt Disney Co's ABC network to cancel its hit revival of her "Roseanne" sitcom, whose popularity Trump has cited as evidence his supporters, who include Barr, want shows that speak to their concerns.
Jarrett said on Tuesday that Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger called her before ABC revealed the show's cancellation.
"Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?" Trump said on Twitter. Trump has been a persistent critic of the news media throughout his campaign and presidency.
Barr blamed her late-night message on the sleep aid Ambien.
"It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible," she wrote in a message that has since been deleted. "I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please."
Ambien's maker, Sanofi, responded Wednesday.
Read: ABC cans 'Roseanne' after TV star's racist tweet
"People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world," its U.S. arm said on Twitter. "While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."
Barr said she was tired of "being attacked and belittled more than other comedians who have said worse" and asked for people not to boycott ABC.
Barr, 65, then apologized "for making a bad joke" about Jarrett, who is black and was born in Iran to American parents.
"Don't feel sorry for me, guys!!," Barr said in a tweet late on Tuesday. "I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet."
Barr's Twitter profile drew supportive comments, with some users saying they believed she had been treated unfairly because of her politics.
Hollywood talent agency ICM on Tuesday dropped Barr as a client. Several networks and the streaming service Hulu said they would no longer rerun her show.
The original "Roseanne" ran from 1988 to 1997, featuring a blue-collar family, the Conners, with overweight parents struggling to get by. It was praised for its realistic portrayal of working-class life.
The current "Roseanne" was ABC's biggest hit of the 2017-2018 season, drawing an average 18.7 million viewers, second only to CBS's "The Big Bang Theory," according to Nielsen data through May 20.

Christian Pulisic is back y'all. The 19-year-old is back to being unbelievable again after a pedestrian showing in the U.S. national team's two September World Cup qualifiers. On Friday night in a must-win match against Panama, Pulisic spearheaded a U.S. attack that scored three first-half goals.
Check out all three goals below:
Pulisic set the tone early with a singular individual effort that ended in an eighth-minute goal:
Just 11 minutes later, Pulisic set the table for a teammate, as his inch-perfect cross found Jozy Altidore in the middle of the box. Altidore did what he does best and sent it into the back of the net:

After a wonderful run by Bobby Wood led to a penalty kick, Altidore stepped to the spot and got cheeky by putting away a Panenka in the 43rd minute:

At just 19 years old it's clear Pulisic is the key for the U.S. When he is at his best, the Americans create tons of chances and are active going forward. When hes off? It's really difficult for them to win.
Here's hoping he stays in-form.
Commuters exit the New York Port Authority in New York City on Monday after reports of an explosion. Photo: Reuters
New York: An explosion rocked New York's Port Authority, one of the city's busiest commuter hubs, on Monday morning and police said one suspect was injured and in custody but that no one else was hurt in the rush-hour incident.
Police confirmed one person was in custody but were not yet identifying the device used. Local news channel WABC cited police officials as saying a possible pipe bomb detonated in a passageway below ground at Port Authority and WPIX cited people in the know as saying a man with a “possible second device” has been detained in the subway tunnel.
The bus terminal was temporarily closed, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said in a Twitter statement.
“There was a stampede up the stairs to get out,” said Diego Fernandez, one of the commuters at Port Authority. “Everybody was scared and running and shouting.”
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and President Donald Trump have been briefed on the incident, according to local media and the White House.
News of the incident jarred financial markets as trading was getting underway for the week. Standard & Poor's 500 index emini futures pared gains, the dollar weakened against the yen and US Treasury securities prices gained on a modest flight-to-safety bid.
The incident occurred less than two months after an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people by speeding a rental truck down a New York City bike path, in an attack for which Islamic State claimed responsibility.
In September 2016, a man injured more than two dozen people when he set off a homemade bomb in New York's Chelsea district.

In the past couple of years, credit card outstanding has been increasing. It went up 35% in value during the April-October period in FY18. We ask experts about the increased focus on credit cards
Sumit Bali, senior executive VP and head-personal assets, Kotak Mahindra Bank
If you look at the overall lending market, there is hardly any demand from companies. A lot of repricing is happening, but there is no fresh demand coming in. It is the same story for home loans as well. These are two big segments going through a slowdown. On the large ticket loans, a lot of churn is happening. Borrowers with higher rates of interest are negotiating and getting lower rates or moving to other banks at a lower rate. Overall, that segment is not growing for the bank.
However, the unsecured piece has been growing. Over the last few years, we have seen systemic change in unsecured lending. Today, you have a lot of information from the (credit) bureaus. Fintech companies give you a lot of data about a customer. Even if you don't have a customer's credit history, you can still onboard her based on other data about her. Based on the transaction history from her savings account, though she is a new-to-credit customer, a bank is now comfortable to lend. Also, post-demonetization, acceptance of card has grown.
Another reason why personal loan is growing is that there is a segment now that is happy to consume now and pay later. Today if you want to go on a holiday or buy the latest gadgets, the new generation is happy to take a loan. As consumers, you should use credit card sensibly because ultimately it will reflect on your credit history.
Vijay Jasuja, chief executive officer, SBI Card
Overall, credit card spends have increased 42% year-on-year. Our credit card outstanding growth has been 80% year-on-year. There are multiple reasons for the growth in spends. Firstly, the e-commerce boom has increased the spends on the cards. Secondly, the confidence level of consumers to use cards has gone up post-demonetization. Earlier, there was a concept that unless you have a credit history you will not be eligible for a credit card. But now individuals have a higher income in their first year of job itself. But they don't have a credit history. Technically, they will be called new-to-credit customers. Another segment is the individuals in the tier 1 and 2 cities who see their peers using cards.
The question is, will the bubble burst if credit card spends go up significantly? In the credit card asset portfolio, the credit card outstanding amount is of people who are away from the due date. There are customers who get their high-value spends converted to EMIs, which has also increased the overall credit card outstanding amount. Then there are people who don't have sufficient liquidity to pay. They pay a minimum amount and revolve the facility with high interest. This is the segment (that is) risky. About 20-27% of our customers fall in the last segment and it is consistently the same. That means additional and new-to-credit portfolio are not bringing in additional risk.
Ranjit Punja, co-founder and CEO, Creditmantri.com
Largely, since the last downturn in the economy, lenders have become careful about who they lend to. They typically only lend to those who have demonstrated a good credit score. They have clamped down on bad credit customers. However, today, with a general upsurge in income, the whole advent of e-commerce, the ability to pay online and digitally savvy customers has led to utilisation of more income. Banks have started believing that newer fintech models are probably the way to go in terms of underwriting. At this point, it is a drop in the ocean. Banks are making the underwriting journey simpler. There is a lot of data available digitally.
Time will tell if that is a good way to look at lending. At this moment, the end users are enjoying the benefit. Typically, in the financial world, you see these ups and downs. You will see a bad credit cycle and then delinquencies. I am concerned with newer models that are not time tested.
As a consumer you shouldn't spend beyond your means. Credit card and unsecured loans tend to do that to you, especially for people who don't have the discipline to borrow and repay. Credit card is a simple way to overspend. And interest rates are very high. Being credit wise is critical for someone who has not used a credit card ever. Our advice is to start small, display discipline and make sure you service you debt.
Surya Bhatia, New Delhi-based financial planner
The push by the government has helped India convert to a cashless economy. Meanwhile, none of the banks want to miss out on the retail population. The people in the higher income bracket were already having a credit card. Digital banks like Patym Payments Bank will give this a further push. The bigger banks want to have the bigger pie, which includes the HNI segment and those in the higher income group. But the real money in terms of volume is the young population. Everyone wants to grab hold of that population. The young millennials are the people who want to spend, especially digitally.
There is also a bit of loyalty factor. For instance, I still hold the credit card that I got for the first time. In the last many years, I have bought two other cards and discarded them too. But my first credit card still continues. There is no specific reason why I hold on to it. Every bank wants to cash in on that population. The idea is to catch them young and to make them stick with you.
Consumers have also changed. They are now spoilt for choices. In the early days, they used to pay for credit cards. Now there is no concept of paying for cards. For instance, if you spend a certain amount, most of the card providers waive off the charges.
Logically, you should not have more than one card. And better still is stick to a debit card. Once you understand debit cards well enough, then may be opted for a credit card.

Alastair Cook has admitted to England's concerns over potential ball tampering during the Ashes.
Three Australian cricketers, Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, have been suspended for between nine months and a year for their part in a ball tampering incident in South Africa.
But Cook revealed that their was some head scratching in the England dressing room during the Perth Test when Australia managed to get the ball reversing despite wet conditions that would normally not help the practice.
Asked if they suspected anything untoward in the Ashes, Cook said: "Yeah, a little bit, we did think in Perth, when the outfield was wet after the rain, they managed to get the ball reversing although I didn't see anything.

“We were curious in that series at certain moments but then we couldn't get the ball up to 90mph and they consistently could, and there is a theory that the greater the pace the more it goes.”

Cook was an interested observer as the scandal unfolded and added: “I just think it was a real reminder, watching the whole thing, of what people want to watch in sport. They want to see whoever is playing, do it in a fair way. Win lose or draw.”

A brand new £4.2 million ‘free school' set up to train the sports stars of tomorrow is to close after being branded inadequate by Ofsted, just 16 months after its grand opening.
Tory School Standards Minister Nick Gibb toured Plymouth Studio School and cut the ribbon on the taxpayer-funded, state-of-the-art facility in December 2016.
But today the Department for Education today agreed “in principle” to shut the school down, at the request of the trust that runs it.
And the Mirror can reveal parents had already raised serious concerns about the school before Mr Gibb visited.
Mr Gibb, who visited the school with local Tory MP Johnny Mercer, is now the minister in charge of maintaining standards in education.
The decision to close the school will force dozens of children to move to another school part-way through their GCSE studies.

The school will be the 19th of its type to fold since they were introduced in 2010.
It follows a three-year “comedy of errors” with mishaps including staff leaving their jobs and students being locked in a classroom.
The Ofsted report, which has not yet been published, is understood to grade the school as inadequate, and identifies a string of teaching and safeguarding concerns.
The troubled school has had three headteachers since it first launched in temporary buildings in 2015.
It was officially opened in 2016, after building work was completed.

But concerns were raised within weeks of the new building opening, when a group of children is locked in a classroom for almost an hour after the door mechanisms failed.
Local councillors were concerned pupils could have been in danger in the event of a fire, because it does not have a sprinkler system.
One parent told the Plymouth Herald the school had been bedeviled by high staff turnover, including having three head teachers.
“It's been a comedy of errors,” she said. “My child had six different maths teachers in a term-and-a-half.
“In 2015 I complained things were not right. It's been calamitous from start to finish.
“I feel very bad for Year 10 students that are halfway through GCSEs.
“And the DfE needs to make it clear what they are going to do to help children affected by this failing school, if they have poor exam results as a result of being at this school.”
Another parent wrote to the school after her daughter had been left in tears because she had been left so far behind in her GCSE studies as a result of the school's failings.
And emails seen by the Mirror reveal concerns were raised to Ofsted, the board of Governors and local councillors for months before Mr Gibb attended the school's 'grand opening' in December 2016.
Studio schools are a type of ‘free school' which are taxpayer funded and designed to offer academic and vocational qualifications, but operate outside of direct local authority control.
Headteacher Mark Cahill said: “We are extremely sorry to be announcing this news, which we recognise will come as a disappointment to parents and pupils.
“Our primary concern now is the future wellbeing and best outcomes for our pupils.
“We are assured by the local authority that there are sufficient places in the city's secondary schools to accommodate all Studio School pupils, and my staff will be working closely with the local authority, the Regional Schools Commissioner and others to ensure a smooth transition for all of our pupils to their new schools.
“Our focus for the rest of the year will continue to be on providing the very best teaching, learning and assessment we can for our pupils.”
The Mirror approached the Department for Education for comment, but they had not responded at the time of publication.

Among the three funds, Tata Opportunities Fund II is likely to follow a strategy similar to the first fund, which invested a bulk of its capital in Tata group firms such as Ginger Hotels and Tata Sky. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint
Mumbai: Tata Capital Ltd, a financial services business of the Tata group that manages various private equity funds, has earmarked $115 million to be invested as its general partner commitment, as the firm looks to raise up to $1 billion across three private equity funds, said two people aware of the development.
The three new funds that Tata Capital is raising are Tata Opportunities Fund II, Tata Capital Growth Fund II and Tata Capital Healthcare Fund II. Tata Capital had raised $600 million, $240 million and $75 million, respectively, in their maiden versions.
“Tata Capital is on the road to raise three new funds, which could see them raise a total of close to $1 billion, if the fund-raisings are successful,” said one of the persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak with the media directly.
“For these three funds— Tata Opportunities Fund II, Tata Capital Growth Fund II and Tata Capital Healthcare Fund II—they are looking to raise $500-600 million, $300-350 million and around $120 million, respectively,” he added.
While fundraising for the Opportunities and Growth funds are in the initial stages, that for the Healthcare fund could be closed as early as the end of this calendar year, he added.
To support the fundraising activities of the three funds, Tata Capital has earmarked significant sums of capital to be invested as the general partner or co-investment commitments in each of them.
A general partner or fund manager is typically required to commit a certain percentage of the fund's capital from its own pocket in order to have ‘skin in the game'. This gives comfort to third-party investors in the fund, so-called limited partners, that the manager will invest capital responsibly as its own money is also at stake.
Tata Capital will invest $50 million each in both Opportunities and Growth funds, while the Healthcare fund is receiving a commitment of Rs100 crore, said the second person cited above, also requesting anonymity. “The $50 million investment in Tata Opportunities Fund will be in the form of co-investment,” he added.
An email sent to Tata Capital last week did not elicit any response from the company.
The Tata Opportunities Fund, through its maiden $600 million fund, invested the bulk of its capital in Tata group companies such as Ginger Hotels, Tata Sky, and Tata Projects Ltd. The second fund is expected to follow a largely similar strategy.
In August 2015, the Opportunities fund invested an undisclosed amount in taxi-hailing app Uber Technologies Inc. According to Reuters, the deal was worth $75-100 million. Other non-Tata group investments include auto-component maker Varroc Engineering Pvt. Ltd and TVS Logistics. The fund is headed by Padmanabh Sinha.
Tata Capital Growth Fund, which is headed by Akhil Awasthi, has invested in companies such as small finance bank licensee Janalakshmi Financial Services Ltd, insurance company Star Health and Allied Insurance Co. Ltd and affordable lender Home First Finance Co.
Apart from these funds, Tata Capital also manages a sector-agnostic venture capital fund, Tata Capital Innovations Fund. The fund invests in the range of $2-10 million in early-stage companies offering technology-based solutions for Indian as well as global markets.
Tata Capital's fundraising comes at a time when a large number of fund managers are out in the market to raise capital, on the back of India's increased attraction due to relatively stronger economic growth among emerging market peers and economic reforms such as the goods and services tax.
About two dozen private equity industry executives are on the road to raise up to $2 billion for their new funds, across private equity and venture capital, Mint reported in July last year.
The list includes former Carlyle Group managing director Mahesh Parasuraman and former India Value Fund Advisor partner Sunil Vasudevan's Amicus Capital; former KKR India director Heramb Hajarnavis's Sea Link Capital Partners; and Siddharth Parekh's Paragon Partners.
A 19-year-old learner from Siyathuthuka High School who was captured on camera assaulting a female student and had the video circulating on social media is expected to appear at the Ntuzuma Magistrate Court on Monday.
The learner was arrested by the Inanda police after his father handed him over following the Department of Education official's visit to the school to investigate the matter.
The female learner has since been moved to another school after the incidence.
In the clip that is alleged to have been captured last year in November, the 19-year-old can be seen assaulting and swearing at the learner on school premises.
The Department of Education condemned the incident and immediately launched an investigation to discover the school.
This was followed by the arrest of the pupil over the weekend.
“The department has condemned this violence in the strongest terms possible and such will not be tolerated within the school environment and should not be tolerated in our society at large and will ensure that the strongest action possible is taken against the offending learner,” said Department of Education in a statement.
According to reports, the father of the learner said that the boy assaulted the girl because she accused him of being too skinny as if he had HIV.

The new-look Beehive Centre store will see a number of changes take place in the coming weeks.
The Walmart-owned superstore is having a refresh of all areas in the shop, although there will major improvements to several departments.
It is due to be completed by Monday June 11- just in time for barbecue season.
The new-look supermarket will feature a complete refurb of the George department and fitting rooms.

Customers will also be able to enjoy a fresh new deli area, as well as brand new 'scan and go' checkouts.
Asda has gained internet fame after selling a number of popular household items, for competitive prices.
Among This is an inflatable paddling pool, costing £30, which last year turned out to be the ultimate summer must have.
The Intex Inflatable Family Lounge Pool comes in a blue and white colour and has two built-in drink holders. It also has a 900-litre water capacity and comes with its own drain plug and repair patch.
The customer reviews are glowing, with most of them giving it a five-star rating. A customer with the username Superdragonbex commented: “As awesome as it seems! Sit back and relax (cup holders and everything!).”
Speculation is still rife about what could replace neighbouring popular toy store Toys R US, after it closed its doors in March.
Some believe the shop could become occupied by rival budget supermarket Lidl after the chain announced in February that is is looking to procure four sites in Cambridge alone.

More than 2,000 London Marathon runners have pledged to do another 3.7 miles as a tribute to chef Matt Campbell, who died in hospital after collapsing at the event.
Matt, a talented and lauded private chef who appeared on MasterChef: The Professionals in 2017, sadly died after falling ill 22.5 miles into the marathon – the hottest to take place in the capital on record.
In his honour, Matt Dorber, 33, from Somerset, has set up a #FinishforMatt campaign.
The idea is to bring London Marathon runners together in remembrance and to help raise money for the Brathay Trust, Matt Campbell's chosen charity.

Matt Dorber posted the idea in a London Marathon support group, and thousands have pledged to take part.
"It was devastating to hear the news of Matt," he told the Mirror.
"It was so sad to see. When I saw the news, it was a realisation really – it could've happened to any one of us. It was a very hot day and it was tough.
"We just want to do something in Matt's memory. Obviously, nothing is going to bring him back, but if we can do those last 3.7 miles with him, in his name, it would be a nice thing.
"We all ran the marathon together. So we think we should finish for Matt – and if we can raise a little more money doing it, great."
(Image: Matt Dorber)
While an unofficial event, the aim is to inspire London Marathon participants to get together in local groups and run the last 3.7 miles wherever they are.
Matt hopes to get #FinishforMatt trending and to see everyone taking part donate to the Brathay Trust, which works to support vulnerable young people and help them get into work.
Helen Phillips, who helps run London Marathon Training and Support, said she's been moved by the idea.
She told Mirror Online: "It's just a small thing, but we just want to do something to honour Matt. It's desperately sad what happened.
"We hope lots of people get together to finish those 3.7 miles. It doesn't matter when and where – whatever works. It'd just be good to bring people together."
Matt Campbell, from the Lake District, was just 29. He was a keen marathon runner and was inspired by his father Martin, who died suddenly 18 months ago.
(Image: mattsoire/Instagram)
Matt wrote on his Just Giving page: "Martin worked tirelessly for Brathay Trust from 2008-2016 documenting the now famous 'Brathay 10 in 10' [a big fundraising endurance test].
"He always spoke to me so passionately about the event and the charity. I really came to appreciate what he was talking about in 2015 when I went along and helped him film one day.
"The amount of positivity and energy at the event was overwhelming. 'Ordinary people doing extraordinary things'.
"All for the cause to help Brathay with its mission to inspire children and young people to make positive changes that will last a lifetime. Put simply, Martin helped change many lives for the good."
Hundreds of people have paid tribute to Matt, including celebrity chefs and food critics.

MasterChef judge Marcus Wareing said: "It is with huge sadness that I received the news of Matt Campbell's untimely death earlier today.
"He was a talented, innovative and driven chef with a bright future ahead of him. My thoughts are with his friends and family at this tragic time."
Grace Dent, who coincidentally mentioned the chef in her latest food review, said Matt was "Brilliant, clever, funny," and "incredibly talented". She added: "This is unfathomable."
More than £100,000 has been raised so far.

Cauliflower wings are a staple in the vegan world. Not necessarily in the sense that vegans eat them every day, but in the sense that they're a testimony that “we vegans also eat indulgent, fried bar food.” Because let's be honest, we all have those select nights where we just want to pop into a hole-in-the-wall with our friends and order some crispy, handheld goodies. And it's usually on nights we're not feeling 100% coherent – but that's part of the fun!
Say we grow up a little, and we no longer go out with groups of friends, buy too many beers, and spend money that's in our savings, but the urge for crispy, cauliflower wings tossed in hot sauce doesn't go away? Well, in that case, these are for you.
I've got to be honest, I've long been afraid of deep frying in my own home, because it uses a lot of oil, controlling temperature can be tricky, and if things get out of hand, your food can end up greasy. It's just been a little too fussy for me to deal with. Albeit, after attempting to make roasted cauliflower wings several times with lackluster results, I decided to try my hand at deep frying.
Come to find out, it's not as tedious as I imagined! I discovered that oil can be reused afterwards (therefore it's not wasteful), temperature can be determined using an easy hack that doesn't require a thermometer (more on that in a minute), and if the oil is hot enough, the wings won't end up greasy! And they're perfectly battered, pleasantly crisp, and tender with a ‘lil resistance on the inside. It's a win-win all around.
Deep-Fry Life Hacks
To tell the temperature of your oil without using a thermometer , simply invert the back of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles start to form around the spoon within 10 seconds, your oil is ready to go. If no bubbles form or it takes 30 seconds, let your oil continue to heat up.

If no bubbles form or it takes 30 seconds, let your oil continue to heat up. Placing fried food directly on paper towels leads to greasier food as paper towels hold the oil right up against the food. To wick away excess oil without holding it against the food, place a cooling rack onto an upside down cookie sheet, with a layer of newspapers or paper towels between. This way, the food and excess oil are kept apart from one another.

This way, the food and excess oil are kept apart from one another. More Bubbles = Less Grease. If the temperature of oil isn't hot enough when food enters the pot, then there won't be enough pressure moving out of the food to keep it from being greasy. If the temperature is between 350-375° F, then there is sure to be enough pressure between the moisture in the food and the presence of the oil to keep grease out. This pressure is indicated by the presence of bubbles.

This pressure is indicated by the presence of bubbles. Over Cooking = Greasier Food. Once bubbles begin to slow down, you know your food is ready to be extracted. If you leave it in there past this point, there is no longer enough moisture pushing out of the food to keep grease out, thus the grease will move in, leaving you with greasy food. No bueno!
To comfort your soul, after making a whole head's worth of cauliflower wings – enough for 3-4 people – only 3-4 tablespoons of oil is actually absorbed. Of which, I'm willing to bet that 1 tablespoon ends up on paper towels, so only 2-3 tablespoons end up in the food. I repeat again: when done right, deep fried food is not greasy food.
Because they've got a kick, hand-held, and fried, these would also be a compliment to your Super Bowl menu this Sunday, if you're into that sort of thing. For me, I just like an excuse to have cauliflower wings.

Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower Wings (Plant-Paradox friendly) Tangy marinated cauliflower is dipped in cassava batter, and fried in coconut oil until lightly golden. Tossed in spicy buffalo sauce right before serving for a crispy handheld delight. Ingredients 1 large head of cauliflower, cut into large pieces (3-4 bites per piece)
1 c full-fat coconut milk
2 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tbsp dijon mustard
1/2 tsp salt
Few grinds of black pepper Batter 100 g (1/2 c + 2 tbsp) tapioca or arrowroot starch
128 g (1 c) cassava flour
13 oz (1 1/2 c + 2 tbsp) light coconut milk
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp onion powder
25-30 oz (2 jars) refined coconut oil, for frying Buffalo Sauce 56 g (1/4 c) Nutiva Buttery Coconut Oil ,
1-2 tbsp lectin-free hot sauce (link features a homemade recipe that ensures Plant Paradox friendliness)
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/2 tsp dijon mustard
1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce Directions In a large bowl, whisk together full-fat coconut milk, lemon juice, dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Then toss in cauliflower pieces to coat and cover bowl with plastic wrap. Allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes, stirring halfway through out. Once cauliflower is close to finished marinating, place all the coconut oil into a large dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot set over medium-high heat. Heat until bubbles form around an inserted wooden spoon or temperature reaches 350-375° F. Place tapioca or arrowroot starch into a medium bowl. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together cassava flour, light coconut milk, salt, oregano, and onion powder. Note: It should be thin enough to whisk without the whisk getting clumped up but thick enough that strands slowly fall off the whisk. If it's too thick add another tablespoon or two of coconut milk. If it's too thin, add another tablespoon or two of cassava flour. Set up draining rig by placing a cooling rack upside down on top of an inverted baking sheet, with a layer of paper towels or newspaper between to wick away oil. Have nearby oil for easy extraction. Prepare buffalo sauce by whisking together mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tbsp of hot sauce in a large mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in melted buttery coconut oil until homogenous. Taste and add more hot sauce if more heat is desired. Have a large bowl standing by the frying rig for tossing the wings in the sauce. To fry the wings, remove a piece of cauliflower and wipe off excess marinate. Place in tapioca starch & stir to coat, then shake off any excess. Dip into cassava batter, wipe off excess, then gently set into pot of oil, holding the tip of the cauliflower in the oil for 5 seconds so that the batter has a second to firm up. Fry only 5-6 pieces at a time. Cook until the batter is lightly brown, stirring halfway through; about 30 seconds per side. Evacuate to cooling rack and start next batch. After two batches are complete, transfer to the large, empty mixing bowl and add in 1 1/2 tablespoon of buffalo sauce. Toss to coat then serve to hungry friends & family while fresh – the quicker they're served, the crispier they'll be. Repeat steps 9-12 until all pieces are battered, fried, and coated in buffalo sauce. Reserve leftover cauliflower marinade to use as a dipping sauce for wings & celery. For preservation of oil, turn off the heat as soon as frying is done. Once it's cool, place a jar in the sink, fit a funnel on top of it, then slowly pour in the oil. Seal with a lid and use again for your next frying venture.

China has appeared to beat the US to the punch when it comes to arming a warship with an electromagnetic railgun .
The futuristic weapon can fling shells across the water at an astonishing 6,710mph.
Pictures leaked onto social media show the Chinese warship with what looks like a railgun strapped to the front. Experts believe this is the case because the weapon is much larger than the usual 37mm point defence cannon mounted on the front.
In the pictures, the Haiyang Shan warship is shown near the Wuchang Shipyard in eastern China. If the country has developed a working prototype, it would be the first nation to have done so.
(Image: Twitter)
(Image: Twitter)
The US and Russia are both developing their own railguns, which fires projectiles along electrically charged rails in order to increase their speed and range.
Magnetic fields created by high electrical currents accelerate a sliding metal conductor, or armature, between the two rails to launch the slug.
Using its extreme speed on impact, the kinetic energy warhead eliminates the hazards of high explosives being kept on the ship, and on land, reduces the chance of unexploded bombs which could potentially be detonated.
(Image: Twitter)
In these pictures, large containers can be seen on the vessel - believed to be containing battery packs that would power the gun.

Jo Konta was back on safer ground at Wimbledon on Tuesday as she won on grass and wittered on about cooking.
British No.1 Konta called her half-baked past year a “learning curve”, after going from reaching semi-finals here at SW19 to now battling to stay in the world's top 50.
She has lost TEN opening matches at events while changing coach again – and even blamed the media for mentioning her rubbish record on clay when she lost in the first round on the red dirt in Paris.
But back on the green grass of home, the former world No.4 made a Pavlova before beating a Russian in straight sets – even if she added the unwanted ingredient of needing six match points in a mess of a tiebreak.
Yet winning still tasted good.
(Image: Reuters)
“It was a great match for me to battle through and fight through until literally the very last point,” she said.
The highlight of Konta's clay-court season was getting asked by Novak Djokovic in Rome to cook gluten-free, dairy-free and taste-free food for him at Wimbledon.
“I will try,” she laughed.
“However, I'm really proud that I made a Pavlova for the first time a couple of days ago. It was the first time I ever made meringue.
“I actually cook a lot more than I bake. I marinated lamb two nights ago, made it last night. That was very good. I think I'm going to make a traybake this evening. You might see the big box coming in.”

Whatever helps Konta to relax, she needs to do more of it.
After going a set and a break up against world No.103 Natalia Vikhlyantseva, the world No.24 lost three consecutive games in the second set and needed to save two sets point before forcing a tiebreak.
The British No.1 then blew five match points – including one with a double fault – before finally finishing the job with a forehand volley.
“Nerves are going to be there,” she said. “Nerves are there for everybody. I am definitely not special in that sense.”
With Andy Murray absent, Konta has the best record of any British player in this year's Wimbledon singles – and the biggest expectations.
(Image: Daily Mirror)
She next faces Dominika Cibulkova — the world No.33 who missed out on a seeding because Serena Williams was promoted. But the world No.24 now wants to go further than last year.
“I'm here as a 2018 Johanna Konta ,” she said. “I am working very hard to be here the whole two weeks.”
As for her last 12 months, she reasoned: “I think everything happens for a reason, so I'm really happy where I am in my career.
“I'm really happy with the challenges that I have because I think they will also help me post-tennis in how I deal with adversity, how I deal with my own struggles.
“I think it's a massive learning curve which I'm really grateful for.”

TV's Chris Packham is ­encouraging dog owners to walk their pets more after it emerged nearly half of our ­animals are overweight.
Failing to take them on walks plus giving them human food has made 45 per cent of the nation's pooches overweight, a SlimFast poll found.
Springwatch presenter Chris, 56, who has a miniature poodle named Scratchy, said: “Someone told me how thin my dog looked but he's at his ideal weight.
“Our inability to recognise a pet's healthy weight is because we are a nation suffering from fat blindness.
(Image: Well Being Walkies)
“Most of us have lost sight of what a normal healthy weight is because overweight has become the norm.
“Under half of dog owners take their dogs for a daily walk. Not only is that a physical issue, it's a mental one as well.”
Scratchy is 14 and Chris walks him from his home in the New Forest, Hampshire, for 5km every morning and a further 3km in the afternoon.
He said: “His joints are becoming a bit stiff so I like to keep him moving.
“I want to keep him happy and healthy for as long as possible.”
Chris, who has Asperger's, says the benefits are vital for him too. “I find that hour in the mornings is imperative for my mental health.
“I'm breathing fresh air, engaging with nature and I'm with the companion I love most in my life. If it couldn't happen there wouldn't be a point of carrying on.”
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, which oversees the revival and liquidation of distressed firms, amended two of its regulations to require that every turnaround scheme should also specify how the interests of these stakeholders will be taken care of. Photo: AFP
New Delhi: Bankrupt businesses exploring turnaround options under pressure from lenders can no longer ignore the interests of their employees, vendors and customers, which in the case of real estate firms would include homebuyers, according to the latest rule changes announced on Friday.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, which oversees the revival and liquidation of distressed firms, amended two of its regulations to require that every turnaround scheme should also specify how the interests of these stakeholders will be taken care of.
“A resolution plan shall include a statement as to how it has dealt with the interests of all stakeholders, including financial creditors and operational creditors, of the corporate debtor,” said a statement by the ministry of corporate affairs .
The amendment incorporates the spirit of the Supreme Court's order last month asking the insolvency professional managing real estate firm Jaypee Infratech Ltd to prepare and submit an interim revival plan that takes into account the interests of homebuyers within 45 days.
The amendment is significant as a turnaround scheme could include significant steps such as management change, lenders converting their loans to equity or sale of assets, which could impact interests of stakeholders other than lenders.
“It is an excellent move and plugs a gaping hole in the corporate insolvency resolution process,” said Sumant Batra, managing partner of law firm Kesar Dass B. & Associates.
Experts said the amendments will also cover public shareholders in the case of a listed company. If lenders convert their loans to equity, the public shareholding in such companies will be diluted.
The requirement to make a disclosure regarding how these stakeholders' interests are dealt with is likely to put pressure on lenders, promoters and the resolution professional to ensure that the steps proposed are justified.
“By default, resolution plans would take care of financial and operating creditors but by making this amendment, the regulator wants that the turnaround scheme should also provide how it has treated other stakeholders such as customers, as in case of homebuyers or the investors of a listed company. This amendment is desirable as the interest of other stakeholders including the corporate debtor itself, is also important and should not be ignored outrightly,” said Manoj Kumar, partner at law firm Corporate Professionals.
The amended rules are Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons Regulations, 2016, and Fast Track Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons Regulations, 2017, said the statement. The amended regulations are yet to be published.

A hero dad who got separated from his 12-year-old daughter while fleeing the Grenfell Tower block inferno went back in to save her.
Marcio Gomes, 38, and his family were on the 21st floor but were told to 'stay put' by fire service operators after being woken by the blaze at 2.30am.
Frightened neighbours came to his door believing it was safer because his flat was on the other side of the building from the flames.
But it soon became apparent the blaze was engulfing the building and it was time to leave.
Mr Gomes led his pregnant wife Andreia, the eldest daughter Luana and her half sister Megan, 10, down the narrow stairwell.

It was filled with black smoke so thick they couldn't see each other, and at times they found themselves stumbling over the bodies of those who didn't make it
The family made it to the safety of the lower levels but then made a sickening realisation - Luana was gone.
Distraught Mr Gomes, a teaching inspector, charged back in and led fire crews to back up the stairwells to where Luana had collapsed halfway down.
He told The sun: "She had stopped.
"She couldn't move any more and had fallen unconscious."

The whole family has been treated in hospital for smoke inhalation.
Friends hailed Mr Gomes' instinctive bravery.
Pal Neil Payne launched a GoFundMe to help the family who believe they have lost all their possessions in the blaze.
He wrote: "Luckily our hero Marcio managed to get them all out although they are in hospital but stable.
"They have lost everything and I am setting this up so that we can all help in a small way to rebuild their lives."

Sadly many others did not escape the horror fire which engulfed the block of 120 flats in west London.
More than 200 firefighters have battled the blaze for 24 hours.
Twelve bodies have been recovered so far, but that number is expected to rise significantly.

In September 2017, Sweden hosted Exercise Aurora, its largest military exercise in nearly 25 years. The exercise involved nearly 30 per cent of the Swedish Armed Forces, as well as troop contributions from NATO Allied and partner countries - which joined on a bilateral basis. The goal of the exercise was to build a stronger defence and increase capability to face an attack. As well as taking place in Stockholm and Gothenburg regions, the exercise featured air, land and sea assets on the island of Gotland and in the Stockholm archipelago. Aurora also featured collaboration between the military and the civilian emergency services.
Footage includes various shots of exercise Aurora in locations across Sweden.

The captains of the WBBL finalists say the women's competition is ready to step from the shadows of men and run on its own.
The Sydney Sixers meet the Perth Scorchers in Sunday's final at Adelaide Oval in a fixture starting before midday as a prelude to the men's BBL finale.
Sixers skipper Ellyse Perry and her Scorchers counterpart Elyse Villani believe their tournament is ripe to become its own stand-alone competition.
"I definitely do," Villani told reporters on Saturday in Adelaide.
"Heading towards the (women's) T20 World Cup in 2020, that is a stand-alone competition.
"I think that is a move that I think Cricket Australia (CA) make soon.
"We're definitely ready for it and looking forward to the challenge of continuing to create our own brand."
Perry said having the WBBL as a stand-alone tournament was on the agenda of CA hierarchy.
"I know they have got plans to potentially make this competition a stand-alone competition," Perry told reporters.
"But at the same time, we want to make sure that this is built on really strong foundations; that there's a wonderful support and following of the game; that people are interested and want to turn up and watch it.
"And I think we have shown that a number of times this year - and the same with the (women's) Ashes series and the amount of people that came out to that.
"The more we keep growing, the more opportunities we have to showcase the game; the more and more it's going to turn into its own product."
Sunday's final is a rematch of last year's decider won by the Sixers.
But the Scorchers have downed the Sydneysiders this season in their two minor-round meetings.
"We have got a really good history with Perth now," Perry said.
"They play an outstanding brand of cricket. They have got some exceptional players in their squad ... they're a great challenge.
"The two sides match up pretty well and we have probably struggled against them this year.
"So it's a great test to come up against them in the final and have another crack."

Pat Phelan proved he simply cannot be beaten on tonight's Coronation Street when he turned the tables on Gary Windass.
The Corrie villain pointed a GUN at his terrified victims, then left fans fearing he will kidnap a newborn baby.
It seemed all was lost in tonight's explosive post-watershed episode when Gary managed to stop Jack Webster letting Pat free.
The serial killer's plan failed when Gary and Sarah Platt turn up to the store room just in time, then paid Kevin's son more money to keep quiet.
Not one to give up easily, Pat started goading his nemesis about Anna and claimed she was "gagging for it" when he raped her.

Incensed Gary lost his temper and whacked Pat over the head with a plank of wood.
But after being lifted back up, Pat managed to break free from his ties and smashed the chair on Gary's head.
Sarah screamed as the murderer stormed out of the store room and hid in the builder's yard.

Hesitant Sarah and Gary tried to work out where he was, but were horrified when he reemerged with a gun in his hand.
“It seems the local constabulary didn't find my hiding place after all. How about that," said Pat with a disconcerting grin on his face.
Gary wouldn't comply with his demands, so he pointed the weapon at Sarah to make him come around.
(Image: ITV)
The decision to tell Pat that Nicola had given birth to baby Zack proved foolish as he demanded to see his grandson,
He told Sarah to phone Nicola straight away so that he could meet his newborn heir.
Threatening to use the gun, Pat said: "Tell her to get over here immediately. And make sure she brings my grandson."
Is Phelan planning to kidnap the newborn baby?
Corrie viewers took to Twitter after watching the frightening scenes.
A third said: "NOOOO NOT THE BABY UGHHHHH PAT PHELAN I SWEAR TO GOD"
Another added: "He's so going to kidnap the baby and then there will be a big chase of finding and catching him"
A third said: "Poor Pat's gonna kill Baby Zack because Pat's jealous that Zack has more hair than him!"

Investors are shying away from Treasury bills earlier than they have in the past. Photo: Bloomberg
New York: In many ways, the thought that the United States of America would default is utterly preposterous.
The nation has never repudiated its debt. The full faith and credit of the federal government has been a cornerstone of US policy since the days of Alexander Hamilton. And no one really questions America's ability to pay.
But in the age of Trump, Wall Street isn't taking anything for granted.
While Republican leaders are confident their party can set aside its differences to resolve the latest debt-limit impasse before the clock runs out sometime between late September and mid-October, investors are shying away from Treasury bills earlier than they have in the past. Last month, they pushed up costs at a sale of three-month bills to the highest since 2008.
Of course, this song and dance over the debt ceiling has become a biennial ritual of sorts on Capitol Hill: A manufactured crisis created by hard-line Tea Party Republicans, which causes lots of hand-wringing but always gets worked out before anything really bad happens. Just this month, Mark Meadows, a leading House conservative, appeared to soften his demands and indicated he was optimistic about getting a deal done.
But with a president who's willing to say the US government “needs a good ‘shutdown,'” a growing number of investors in the world's most important market aren't taking any chances.
“Everybody just gets a little concerned that with the volatility of this administration, some different path could be taken,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for money markets at Federated Investors, which oversees $242 billion in money funds.
America's credibility
What's at stake goes beyond America's credibility in the global debt markets. Not only does the US government owe $7 billion in interest on 2 October, it's also on the hook for $48 billion for Medicare, pay for active-duty military members and benefit payments for civil service and military retirees.
Federated is one of several firms avoiding T-bills that mature shortly after 29 September, when treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin estimates the government will no longer have enough cash to pay its obligations. Because the US is constantly issuing short-term debt, any lingering worries could lead to steeper costs for taxpayers when it sells four-week bills on 5 September and 12 September.
In and of itself, passing a “clean” bill to raise the debt limit shouldn't be hard. But Congress, which returns from its summer recess on 5 September, won't have a lot of time. The House will have 12 working days, and the Senate 17, to raise the debt ceiling, based on a letter Mnuchin sent to speaker Paul Ryan.
The political dysfunction within the Republican Party, which controls both chambers, doesn't help. Differences between moderates and conservatives torpedoed the GOP's attempts to repeal Obamacare, something Republicans have vowed to do for years. And they still haven't tackled many of President Donald Trump's campaign promises like tax cuts or infrastructure spending.
It's not like this issue came out of nowhere: After the Treasury reinstated the debt ceiling in March, it has had to use “extraordinary measures” to help it keep paying its bills.
Costs of Brinkmanship
The costs of brinkmanship are real. The Government Accountability Office said that US borrowing costs increased by $1.3 billion in 2011 because of the debt limit impasse that year, which also led to an unprecedented downgrade from S&P Global Ratings. A separate report concluded that in 2013, investors avoided Treasury bills coming due during debt crisis that year.
Then there's the added wild card of Trump, whose unpredictable and, at times, volatile persona has fuelled investors' jitters.
Back in 2013, when wrangling over the debt limit coincided with a potential government shutdown, three-month bill rates held steady in July and August and didn't start to spike until about two weeks before the 17 October drop-dead date. This time, investors didn't wait. At the July auction of three-month bills (which come due right around the current October deadline), buyers drove up rates to 1.18%, the highest since the credit crisis.
While Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said last week the administration is unified in asking lawmakers to raise the debt limit without any conditions that might provoke a drawn-out fight in Congress, he and Mnuchin also have at various times this year given conflicting signals.
Mulvaney, a founding member of the Tea Party movement's hard-right House Freedom Caucus, has in the past suggested using the debt ceiling bill to try and force changes in the budgeting process.
Beltway optimism
Investors are nervous since they're “uncertain when Treasury runs out of cash,” said Justin Mandeville, a fund manager at Invesco, which oversees $812 billion. “This is a new administration and we're still trying to get our bearings in terms of Congress being able to come together and pass legislation.”
In spite of it all, many inside the Beltway are taking things in stride. Lawmakers suggest that somehow, everything will work out in the end, as it always does. There's plenty of support in the Republican establishment to work out a deal and avoid a debt crisis.
“This is a little bit like ‘The Perils of Pauline,'” Tom Cole, a Republican representative from Oklahoma, said on Bloomberg Radio, referring to the century-old silent movie melodrama. “It always looks like the train is going to run over Pauline, but sooner or later, Pauline magically slips out of it. And I think that's what will happen again in September.”
Nevertheless, getting all the GOP's rank-and-file members on board is hardly a sure thing. And then there are the Democrats, whose votes will be crucial in the Senate.
“I'm not sure where their heads are,” said Thomas Graff, head of fixed-income at Brown Advisory. “It's unclear how informed they are, outside of the Treasury, of what this really means.”
“It definitely makes me nervous.” Bloomberg
India's trade minister Suresh Prabhu says while the country is proud of its GDP growth rate, it cannot be ignored that India is home to more than 600 million poor people. Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint
Buenos Aires: India made a last-minute change in trade minister Suresh Prabhu's plenary session speech at the 11th ministerial conference (MC11) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday to respond to a comment made by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer.
In his plenary session address, Lighthizer seemed to criticize the special and differential treatment enjoyed by large developing countries like India. “We cannot sustain a situation in which new rules can only apply to the few, and that others will be given a pass in the name of self-proclaimed development status. There is something wrong, in our view, when five of the six richest countries in the world presently claim developing country status,” he added.
Lighthizer said WTO members should be troubled that so many members appear to believe that they would be better off with exemptions to the rules. “If in the opinion of a vast majority of members playing by current WTO rules makes it harder to achieve economic growth, then clearly serious reflection is needed,” he added.
Speaking soon after USTR, Prabhu retorted saying the discourse on development at the WTO is sought to be deflected by specious arguments based on aggregate GDP figures. “While in India we are proud of our GDP and growth rates of recent years, propelled by innovative economic policies of my government, we cannot ignore that India is home to more than 600 million poor people,” he said.
“Therefore, we are legitimate demandeurs for special and differential treatment for developing countries. It is also noteworthy that many developed countries of today have benefitted from long periods of derogation from GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) rules in the area of agriculture and textiles,” he added.

BP announced today that a leak from one of its North Slope production wells was stopped at 3:35 am Monday.
State regulators don't yet have an estimate for how much oil and gas was released from the well. The cause of the incident is still unknown.
The well was spewing both gas and crude oil when BP first noticed the leak on Friday morning. State and federal regulators reported the well stopped spraying oil on Saturday after a safety valve was activated.
The well continued venting natural gas until it was killed Monday morning by pumping salt water down the hole. BP is currently maintaining the water pressure until it can use a mechanical plug to secure the well. It's not yet known when that plug can be installed.
The initial response took place during challenging weather conditions, according to Suzanne Skadowski, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's public information officer for the incident.
“It has continued to be very cold, and there have been pretty significant winds. Twenty to 30 miles per hour, upwards of 40 and 50 miles an hour,” said Skadowski.
But Skadowski said the main challenge was the well itself. Two separate leaks had formed and the well had risen three to four feet out of the ground. This caused a pressure gauge to break off, which hindered efforts to kill the well.
BP employees were forced to leave the pad during the incident and no injuries were reported.
Regulators are investigating the leak's impact on the environment, but an initial overflight indicated the crude spray didn't reach the nearby tundra.
Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission Chair Cathy Foerster said her agency will observe the leak investigation, but there's not yet any evidence that BP did something wrong.
“We have no reason to believe that BP did anything that was regulatorily non-compliant. We have no reason to believe that human error was involved. We just don't know,” said Foerster.
Foerster said at the time of the incident, the well was producing about 300 barrels of oil and 30 million cubic feet of gas per day.
The well is located about five miles from the Deadhorse airport, and the nearest community, Nuiqsut, is approximately 50 miles west of the pad.
Update | 2:50 p.m. April 17.
This post has been updated to reflect the fact that the oil release was halted Saturday.

IT WAS A battling, but bitterly disappointing start to the Six Nations from Ireland as they were unable to register a point against a powerful French side in Toulouse.
Many of Ireland's tormentors from the August World Cup humbling in UCD were present for Les Bleus and they didn't take long to assert their dominance and eliminate any doubt that Ireland's winless run away to France was set to continue.
Imposing lock Safi N'Diaye was continually a destructive carrying force and laid the platform for a back-line with impressive attacking verve and Ireland's defence, led by former captains Niamh Briggs and Claire Molloy, was unable to prevent a sweeping sixth-minute attack from yielding a try for Cyrielle Banet who crossed in the corner for her first Test try.
In the 25th minute the deficit doubled, another excellent collective move from Les Bleus stretching Ireland's defence and making space for centre Jade Le Pesq to raid and touch down.

Fullback Jessy Trémoulière knocked over that conversion, but was unable to split the posts with her other two first-half conversion efforts. It mattered little though, as Trémoulière and out-half Pauline Bourdon constantly worried Ireland with evasive running and slick passing to keep Adam Griggs' side on the back foot.
It was 17-0 come half-time. A last-ditch, try-saving tackle from Kim Flood typified the efforts of Ireland on a tough away assignment. Ultimately, the gutsy tackle counted for little as France swiftly reloaded and slick hands put Trémoulière in.

The second half was all about chasing a bonus point for France, but to Ireland's credit, they did manage to make that task a scrappy one despite the worrying sight of second row Ciara Cooney being stretchered off before the hour.
The visitors' best moment of the second 40 was a tenacious kick and chase from debutant Megan Williams, which saw her regain possession 10 metres out from the try-line. The cavalry arrived and the recycles were promising, but a spill from Flood eased the pressure.

Williams was to the fore again minutes later at the other end, chasing down Cyrielle Bane. But the spark lit France's flair again and the bonus point came after a scything angle from Trémoulière was followed up by a superb back-handed offload from Audrey Forlani to put Le Pesq in for her second.
Ireland pushed on into the closing minutes, hoping to force their way onto the scoreboard and avoid the dreaded ‘nil'. But a handling error once again cut the attack short and so they left Toulouse without a point of any kind to show for their efforts.

MANILA -- A traditional Ivatan house-inspired toilet will be built in a provincial park in Basco, Batanes this year for the benefit of locals and tourists alike, the Department of Tourism (DOT) said Tuesday.
The project comes after the ceremonial signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the DOT, the Provincial Government of Batanes and the global non-profit organization World Toilet Association (WTA) to carry out a Public Toilet Flagship Program in tourist destinations in the Philippines.
The project will be sponsored by the Suwon Municipality Government of Korea and Korea Toilet Association.
DOT said the WTA has chosen the Philippines among its developing country members for its Public Toilet Construction Support Project this year alongside Cambodia, Lao, and Bangladesh.
WTA will provide P1,750,000 (USD 35,000) for the traditional Ivatan house-inspired toilet.
DOT-Cagayan Valley Director Virgilio Maguigad, Governor Marilou Cayco, and WTA Chief Manager Sungyeon Nikki Kim formalized the agreement after a series of site inspections of the picturesque Naidi Lighthouse and the provincial park last week.
According to the DOT, the proposed restroom design will reflect the traditional Ivatan architecture with cogon roof, nickel ceiling, and the trademark stone-finish both for functionality and aesthetic purposes.
Also proposed for the project is an independent water tank and solar panels with cubicles designed for senior citizens and differently-abled.
Construction will start in May and is expected to be completed by November. Meanwhile, the inaugural ceremony is scheduled in December.
Meanwhile, a total of P7 million has been allocated this year for building five public lavatories and renovation of two others within the province of Batanes, said Cayco.
This will be done in public spaces like the markets, eating establishments, community centers, tourism attractions, heritage and conservation sites.
The DOT has currently accredited 26 rest areas within the country with six in Cagayan Valley.
Accredited rest areas in gasoline stations require proper ingress and egress located along a major highway or road, adequate parking, restroom, visible signage, courteous staff, and sundries shop.
The agency also plans to roll out a nationwide awareness campaign to recognize outstanding public restrooms that comply with Asean Public Toilet Standards in time for the World Toilet Day late this year.
DOT Secretary Wanda Teo said that considering the holistic needs of tourists is part of the Filipino brand of hospitality.
"As visitors flock to our tourist destinations, the need for accessible and clean public restrooms arises," Teo said.
She said that though tourists visit places like Batanes to “relax, breathe some fresh air, and unwind,” not being able to find a clean toilet may affect their stay.
The tourism chief stressed that restrooms are necessary not just for responsible tourism but also for environmental protection.
“Toilets and rest areas can be considered as the basic unit of sanitation which is integral in waste management and environmental protection. In order to promote responsible tourism in the country, we need more of these facilities first,” she said. (PNA)

Geneva: Pakistan has been given “concrete evidence” about its cross-border “encouragement and support” for the protests in Kashmir, India told the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), accusing Islamabad of resorting to “short- sighted tactics” to divert attention.
Exercising its Right of Reply during a general debate at the 35th session of the UNHRC, India accused Pakistan of “misusing” the UN platform to pursue its political objectives.
“Pakistan's unsolicited and unwarranted comments pertaining to the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of the Union of India, are factually incorrect and bear no relationship to reality,” India said in a statement.
Asserting that Pakistan is using terror to destabilise Kashmir, it said, “The foremost challenge to stability in Kashmir is the scourge of terrorism, which receives sustenance from Pakistan and the territories under Pakistan's control.”
“Contrary to Pakistan's claims, and in gross violation of UN Security Council resolution 1267, the designated terrorist entities and organisations continue to carry out their activities freely as reported in the local Pakistani print, audio-visual and social media,” it said.
India said that “concrete evidence” about cross-border encouragement and support for the protests in Kashmir has been handed over to Pakistan.
“Instead of working with a sense of purpose to address this issue, Pakistan resorts to short-sighted tactics to divert attention, as we have once again seen today,” it said.
“Pakistan keeps referring to UN Security Council Resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir. However, it very conveniently forgets its own obligation under these resolutions to first vacate the illegal occupation of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir,” India said.
Pakistan had described the situation in Kashmir as “India's national shame” and said that this “hateful cycle can only be stopped through political dialogue”.
India also criticised Pakistan for “blatantly” disregarding its other commitments saying, “be it under the 1972 Simla Agreement, the 2004 joint declaration foreswearing terrorism as well as the understanding between our two Prime Ministers at Ufa in Russia”.
“The people of Jammu and Kashmir have chosen and reaffirmed their destiny repeatedly through India's well- established democratic processes. Pakistan, on the other hand, has witnessed continuous degradation and weakening of its institutions,” it said.
Asserting that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is administered by a “deep state” and has become an epicenter of terrorism, India said Pakistan's human rights record in PoK and Balochistan is deplorable.
“It has had no hesitation in using air power and artillery against its own people, not once but repeatedly over the years. It is high time for Pakistan to do some deep introspection. We would once again urge Pakistan to focus its energies on improving human rights situation and dismantling the terrorism infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK. This would go a long way in bringing peace and stability to the region and beyond,” India said.
President Trump Is Sending NASA Back To The Moon
Enlarge this image toggle caption NASA NASA
President Trump has formally told NASA to send U.S. astronauts back to the moon.
"The directive I'm signing today will refocus America's space program on human exploration and discovery," he said.
Standing at the president's side as he signed "Space Policy Directive 1" on Monday was Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt, one of the last two humans to ever walk on the moon, in a mission that took place 45 years ago this week.
Since that time, no human has ventured out beyond low-Earth orbit. NASA doesn't even have its own space vehicle, having retired the space shuttles in 2011. Americans currently ride up to the International Space Station in Russian capsules, though private space taxis are expected to start ferrying them up as soon as next year.
For now, the ultimate goal for human exploration in space remains Mars.
"This time, we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint, we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars and, perhaps someday, to many worlds beyond," Trump said.
Exactly how to get to Mars, however, is subject to debate within the space community.
Many see the moon as the best stepping stone, including Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., who is Trump's pick to head NASA.
The general moon-first approach being taken by the Trump administration was clearly articulated by Vice President Pence at a meeting of the National Space Council in October.
That's why John Logsdon, a space historian at The George Washington University, says Monday's announcement is not a surprise. "Now the question is whether the White House will propose and the Congress appropriate the funds needed to turn the words into reality," Logsdon says.
Indeed, actually getting the funding to achieve presidents' ambitious space goals is a perennial problem for NASA.
Returning astronauts to the moon had been the plan under President George W. Bush, who called for building a moon base and establishing an extended human presence there. But when a blue-ribbon committee reviewed human spaceflight in 2009, it said there was a mismatch between the scope of the program and the money available to support it: that exploring beyond low-Earth orbit wasn't going to be viable without billions of dollars more in funding.
What's more, many worried that NASA would get bogged down in the gray lunar dust and fail to move on toward the Red Planet.
That's part of why the Obama administration shifted the focus from the moon to a "flexible path" that would target new destinations, such as an asteroid, to get astronauts farther out into deep space.
But the asteroid mission proved more difficult than expected. Eventually, NASA proposed having a robot haul a boulder from an asteroid and put it in orbit around the moon, where astronauts would rendezvous with the space rock. The so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission didn't receive very enthusiastic reviews from the space community or Congress, and this year it got the ax.
NASA has recently been working on plans for something called the Deep Space Gateway, an outpost in orbit around the moon.
And at the behest of Congress, the space agency has been building a giant new rocket and a deep space capsule. The vehicle is supposed to have its first test flight in 2019, when it will send an uncrewed capsule up to orbit the moon before returning to Earth.
Officials in the Trump administration asked NASA to consider putting humans on that flight, but NASA ultimately decided against it after a review. The first mission with a crew on that NASA spacecraft isn't supposed to happen until 2022.
The company SpaceX is also constructing a large rocket and has announced that it intends to launch the first private mission to the moon in 2018. SpaceX says it has paying customers for a trip in an automated capsule that wouldn't land, but would loop around the moon and then return.
SpaceX also has contracts with NASA to bring astronauts up to the International Space Station and is scheduled to start doing that next year as well. The company has already been hauling cargo to and from the station for NASA.
Boeing also has a space transportation system in the works, and its first flight with NASA astronauts on board is planned for 2018.
If those companies' efforts pan out, their space taxis will be the first vehicles to carry up astronauts from U.S. soil since the retirement of the space shuttles.

Mike Zito - Make Blues Not War (Ruf Records). The co-founder of the excellent Royal Southern Brotherhood is now firmly established as a top notch solo performer, and Zito's new Ruf CD soared into the higher reaches of the Billboard Blues Chart on the day of its release. The Missouri-born singer and guitarist's sterling efforts are aided and abetted here by fellow bluesmen Walter Trout and Jason Ricci as he unveils what is arguably his finest offering to date, blessed with muscular gems such as Highway Mama and the harmonica-led Chicago blues of the robust title track.
The Ladies Sing the Blues - (Union Square). This inexpensive new two-CD anthology focusses attention on an interesting selection of archive recordings culled from the back catalogues of many of the leading lights of jazz and blues during the 30s, 40s and 50s. Classic offerings from the likes of Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald are given an airing alongside lesser known but equally compelling ditties such as Sippie Wallace's I'm A Mighty Tight Woman and the formidable Memphis Minnie's 1933 country blues opus, Too Late.
Robyn Stapleton - Songs of Robert Burns (Laverock Records). This wide-ranging celebration of the work of Scotland's national bard finds Robyn Stapleton in peerless form as she explores the themes of history, humanity, love and nature via some of Burns' most iconic musical creations. The use of a string quartet lends added charm to fine tracks such as Westlin' Winds and Parcel O'Rogues, contrasting nicely with the much more traditionally folksy flavour of Tae the Weavers and Comin' Through The Rye.
Lucie Horsch - Vivaldi (Decca Classics). The contents of this splendid new offering from 16-year-old recorder prodigy Lucie Horsch should come as a pleasant surprise to those culturally deprived listeners whose knowledge of the musical landscapes created by Antonio Vivaldi‘s extends only as far as the perenially popular Four Seasons and, sadly, no further. This prolific composer actually penned a vast body of work during the course of his lengthy career, and Lucie displays her natural affinity for the gifted Venetian's vivid Baroque repertoire as she tackles a beguiling assortment of concertos and transcriptions in close collaboration with the Amsterdam Vivaldi Players.

'False allegations'
They are often granted in the absence of the person being accused of abuse (the respondent) and without accusations of domestic abuse being proven
The making of an order then also enables the complainant to draw on thousands of pounds in legal aid which can also be used in any subsequent family law cases
The respondent would not be automatically entitled to legal aid, however, and often has to represent themselves
The level of evidence required is fairly low and can relate to claims about verbal abuse, unwanted text messages or emails
Thousands of parents falsely claim domestic abuse in order to access legal aid and stop estranged partners from seeing their children, a shared parenting charity claims.Families Need Fathers says parents are being encouraged by some solicitors to file for non-molestation orders - injunctions used in urgent abuse cases.New figures show a 30% rise in orders made after legal aid was axed in everything but abuse cases in family courts in 2012.Some 25,700 were made in England and Wales in 2017, and 6,699 in the first quarter of 2018.The changes to legal aid qualification in England and Wales were designed to reduce the number of cases in family courts, with separating couples being encouraged to attend mediation sessions instead, and to cut the legal aid bill.But charity caseworkers say they are seeing "thousands" of parents, mainly fathers, who have been made subject to these orders for things that they do not consider to be domestic abuse.These could be angry comments thrown in the midst of the break-up or dealing with child access arrangements or unpleasant text messages, they say.A spokesman for the charity said:Jerry Karlin, chairman of Families Need Fathers, said the result of the government's "well-intended but ill-conceived changes" to the family courts system was a 30% increase in non-molestation orders (NMOs) to 25,000 a year.There had also a 20% rise in private family court applications over the last two years, he added. "NMOs work like injunctions and are designed to protect domestic abuse victims from further harm in emergency situations.The charity stresses that they are useful in genuine cases of abuse, but is concerned that thethey are administered leaves them open to exploitation. For example:"We know from our work with survivors that non-molestation orders can be difficult to obtain and the court process itself can be distressing for victims."There has been a small increase in the number of non-molestation orders applied for and being granted since these orders first came into force in 2003."Given that the police are recording record numbers of domestic abuse-related incidents and offences, we would expect the number of non-molestation orders being applied for and granted to increase over this period as more victims have the courage to report to the police and seek protection through the justice system."
A new, stripped down version of Spotify is currently being tested that will be a lot kinder to your data plan. As the name suggests, it's a paired down version of the app and comes with some nifty features, including the ability to put a cap on the data you are using to listen to songs. The actual app weighs in at just 15MB, which is a whole 75MB lighter than the full-fat version of the app.
All this sounds great but there are a few caveats. The app is being tested in selected countries (including Brazil) and there's no word yet on if a full rollout will happen.
There are some features missing, too, including offline listening and high-quality playback. There's no Spotify Connect either, so no seamless connecting up to your house speakers either. And it's only available to Android users for now.
Key features missing
These features aren't exactly bloatware and, for many, are integral to how they use Spotify. The inability to pick songs to play (it's all shuffle, unfortunately) will also mean this is an app that's not designed for those with a premium account.
This isn't the only thing Spotify is testing. It announced in April that it would be making changes to its free tier and relaxing things such as shuffle play. So, users can choose to listen to tracks, as long as they appear on one of the 15 personalised playlists. The app is also said to come with a low data mode, so very similar to what this Lite version offers.

Turkish Voters Narrowly Approve Referendum To Expand Presidential Powers
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won a referendum, giving him more power, by a narrow margin on Sunday. The opposition is demanding a recount of some ballots.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
And now to Turkey, which voted yesterday to give more powers to its president. The victory was surprisingly narrow. International monitors are raising questions about the vote, and the opposition is demanding a recount of some ballots. NPR's Peter Kenyon has more on what a divided Turkey may face under the new system.
PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Supporters of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan say he's on track to become the most powerful Turkish leader since the Republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and they are overjoyed.
(SOUNDBITE OF CLANGING POTS AND PANS)
KENYON: But in neighborhoods that voted against these sweeping changes, the clanging of pots and pans serves as a nonverbal sign that many Turks remain deeply opposed to the change. Twenty-eight-year-old no voter Cansu Yazici says it's not just about Erdoğan. She would've voted against giving even her favorite president these additional powers. She says it's just too risky.
CANSU YAZICI: Giving all the powers to a single person is never good at - anywhere. You should also give the power to the people, actually, to decide about their future 'cause in Turkey, there are so many different people.
KENYON: Turks have seen strongman leaders before. Ataturk yanked a 20th century nation state out of the remnants of the Ottoman Empire and forcibly turned an entire population toward the west. Now analysts say Turkey is moving toward a similar period of one man dominating the political scene but from a very different perspective.
Mustafa Akyol, a Turkish author and visiting fellow at Wellesley College, says even though supporters of this referendum are calling it a victory for democracy, he believes the reduced checks on presidential power in the new system will undermine the nature of that democracy.
MUSTAFA AKYOL: So in that sense, it is making Turkey officially an illiberal democracy because in liberal democracies, separation of powers, checks and balances are really important values. And Turkey's obviously moving from that right now.
KENYON: When the new system kicks in, Erdoğan will assume the executive powers now held by the prime minister, and he will also gain more influence - direct and indirect - over the parliament and the judiciary. But yes voters say the people have spoken, and the opposition should drop its complaints about the vote and move on. Thirty-year-old Omer Faruk says no voters are overreacting.
OMER FARUK: My close friends - some of them - they're also saying no because of Erdoğan. How do I say it? They have been tired of Erdoğan. I understand them, but this is democracy.
KENYON: How to bridge this divide is the challenge now facing Erdoğan if he chooses to take it up. Analyst Mustafa Akyol says Erdoğan has tried to calm tensions after previous votes, but they've always bubbled up again eventually.
AKYOL: The country is very divided. And actually, a constitutional design approved only by 51 percent of society and fiercely opposed by the rest is actually an unhealthy state of affairs.
KENYON: If he keeps winning elections as he has for nearly 15 years now, Erdoğan could remain in power until at least 2029. But Akyol says the very closeness of this vote should cause some concern.
AKYOL: In 2019, he will have the next presidential elections. And the vote he got just yesterday shows that it is not given that he will win these.
KENYON: On the other hand, after more than a decade in power, Erdoğan still faces no political rival considered powerful enough to defeat him, and his supporters don't seem worried yet. Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Istanbul.

A hilarious and often infuriating spoof Twitter account which mocked easyJet customers and spoofed the company appears to have been suspended.
A search for the Twitter handle @EasyJetCustCare this evening turned up a page carrying the message "Account suspended. This account has been suspended. Learn more about why Twitter suspends accounts or return to your timeline."
EasyJet was not seeing the funny side of the spoof account which started answering people's complaints on Twitter with hilarious results.
Easyjet had been trying to keep on top of things, apologising to customers who have fallen victim to the fake customer-service and saying that the account has been reported.
The company don't seem to see the funny side, and when asked for a comment an easyJet spokesperson said simply: “easyJet provides help for customers, flight updates and news on Twitter @easyJet.
"Latest information on flights is also always available on the easyJet Flight Tracker, online at easyjet.com/flight-tracker or through the easyJet app.”
The story of short-lived spoof account @EasyJetJustCare
In the age of social media the internet is awash with outrage. Your bus is late? Tweet the bus company a public message of disgust. Flight delayed? Get on Twitter and slate the airline for their terrible service.
The recent air traffic control strike in France left tens of thousands of passengers delayed or stranded, and as a result the Twitter accounts of airlines were white-hot with a barrage out outraged tweets from passengers who had been left in the lurch.
Some of those most heavily bombarded by online rage were the budget airlines whose customer service operations can sometimes be a little less agile than their upmarket competitors.
The ocean of unanswered tweets from outraged easyJet customers proved an opportunity too good to pass up for one group of internet jokers.
These unknown internet comedians set up their own spoof easyjet customer care Twitter account and started answering people's complaints with hilarious results.
The spoof account looked legit at first glance, it was called EasyJet with the company logo as its picture and the handle @EasyJetCustCare.
But it's ‘answers' to customer queries are definitely not your run-of-the-mill customer service responses.
That isn't to say these customers don't have legitimate complaints, its just that ‘Tom' or ‘Dave' often seem to answer them before easyJet's official Twitter account.
Customer's responses to being trolled range from fury to amusement, some obviously don't welcome the added annoyance of internet trolls popping-up at an already-stressful time while others seems to see the funny side.
One customer enquiring angrily about a delayed departure was told: “Hi, just looked into this for you and the pilot parked the plane and can't remember where he left it.”
Another man tweets angrily to easyJet asking about food vouchers as he has been delayed, the spoof account answers saying they can send him some, which seems to placate him somewhat only to follow it up by telling him: “The vouchers are out of date so you can't get food but you could eat the vouchers? - Tom.”

Extraordinary video shows the view from on board a high-speed drone as it races another remote controlled aircraft.
The video begins with the drone appearing to chase another drone in a local park.
The viewing position on board the aircraft gives the viewer an amazing insight into the handling ability of the drone.
It is able to pivot and apparently turn on dime as it completes the course.
The course involves ducking through trees and missing fences.
(Image: YouTube/Ricky P)
The main course markers are green semi circle hoops pitched into the ground.
Like an Olympian kayaker ducking between their course markers, the drone ducks under the hoops to complete the course.

The video, believed to have been shot in the USA, was broadcast by YouTube user Ricky P .
"Back and fourth battles all day with Kyle "AMOK"," Ricky wrote.
He told one excited viewer a prospective racer just needs about $200 to $300 to build the drone.
All up, it cost about $1000 dollars for a set up like his.

The UK's first professional drone race was staged in London in June as a headline event during London Tech Week .
Race organisers The Drone Racing League (DRL) brought the elite race series to London, with their championship event hosted at the iconic Alexandra Palace.
Eight pilots competed to be crowned the "best in the world" during the winner-take-all season finale.

Macaulay Culkin has gone from “Home Alone” to mostly just wanting to be left alone.
The actor made a rare appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” Monday and discussed the pitfalls that come from being a baby-face best known for a holiday-themed classic.
“I definitely don't [go out],” Culkin said, referring to the holiday that made him famous. “It's my season. It's Macaulay season. I try to go out less and less around that time of year.”
As for the “Home Alone” movies themselves — which came out in 1990 and 1992 — the 37-year-old told DeGeneres he doesn't “really watch them all that often.”
“We did a 15-year anniversary DVD commentary, I realized I hadn't seen it in like 15 years,” he said. “Whereas [director] Chris Columbus watched it the night before like a responsible human being. It's like background radiation at Christmastime.”
But still, it's a relief to see the actor seemingly avoiding the child-star curse. He spent the interview looking happy, healthy, and — as everyone in the world notices daily — youthful. Culkin understands very well he still possesses the face of a preteen defending his home from burglars.
“How can a person look too much like himself? It's a curse and a blessing,” he joked. “I can get into any restaurant I want without a reservation, but while I'm there everyone's staring at me. And they're all going, ‘Aww!' ”
Understandable. Just, please, do not ask Macaulay Culkin to put his hands on his cheeks in the classic “Home Alone” pose. “It's just like, no,” he said. “I've been there, done that, you know?”
Virginia State Senate Passes Medicaid Expansion
The Virginia State Senate voted Wednesday to expand Medicaid to 400,000 low-income residents. This comes after months of fierce political debates between Republicans.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Despite longtime Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act, Virginia's state Senate voted today to expand Medicaid under the ACA. That means coverage for almost 400,000 low-income residents. Four Republicans crossed the aisle to support the move. Mallory Noe-Payne is a reporter for Radio IQ and Virginia Public Radio in Richmond. I spoke to her earlier and started by asking her what brought some Republicans on board.
MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, BYLINE: Well, their reasoning is largely financial. If Virginia expanded Medicaid, essentially the state would shift hundreds of millions of dollars from our state budget to the federal budget. There are a lot of things that the state provides that if we expanded Medicaid the federal government would be responsible for paying for. So that frees up state money for education spending, public safety. That has always been the case.
This year, there is one big thing that's changed that they both cite in their reasoning, and that's the Trump administration. Unlike the Obama administration, the Trump administration is supporting conservative reforms to Medicaid expansion, things like work requirements. And so that's able to be part of the compromise package here in Virginia.
CORNISH: So talk a little bit more about that. It sounds like Virginia Republicans aren't worried about the Medicaid expansion going away under the Trump administration. They're willing to work with these new restrictions.
NOE-PAYNE: So part of bringing Republicans to the table when this conversation started at the beginning of the year was implementing conservative reforms, things like work requirements - so making sure that people who are eligible for Medicaid are looking for work or maybe volunteering or seeking education, things that we see in other welfare benefits but haven't traditionally seen in Medicaid.
CORNISH: Is that a dramatic shift for Virginia?
NOE-PAYNE: Yeah, it's a big shift for Virginia. Republicans hadn't supported Medicaid expansion at all before. And the Republicans in the House of Delegates changed their tune this year for the first time.
CORNISH: Now, I understand former Senator Rick Santorum was there today telling Republicans to vote no on the expansion. What did he have to say, and do you think he'll have any sway with local Republicans in Virginia?
NOE-PAYNE: What he had to say was that it's possible the Affordable Care Act could still be repealed. That would be bad for Medicaid expansion. It means that those federal dollars would go away. So he was trying to convince Republicans that they weren't secure dollars.
CORNISH: And that would leave Virginia on the hook for 2 billion, correct?
NOE-PAYNE: For - yes, a lot of money. And that's been the concern in the past. That's been one of the reasons that Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid before. But something that's different this year is that a repeal and replace effort failed in Congress. And so Republicans feel a little bit more certain that because that effort failed, it's not going to come up again.
CORNISH: With this, Virginia becomes I think the 33rd state, you know, that would approve Medicaid expansion. Do Virginians see themselves as part of a broader movement?
NOE-PAYNE: I think so. I mean, this vote comes after November's elections, where we saw a lot of Democrats come out. They changed the makeup of our state legislature. And so, I mean, we had this blue-wave election, and now there's been real policy consequences. And so heading into these midterm elections, I think that people will turn to Virginia as an example of what happens when people come out and vote.
CORNISH: Mallory Noe-Payne is a reporter for Radio IQ and Virginia Public Radio in Richmond. Thank you for sharing your reporting with us.
NOE-PAYNE: You're welcome.

When Jack Clarke was 8 years old, doctors told his parents that he'd likely never walk or talk again.
On Sunday, he walked across the Drake Knapp Center stage to accept his diploma during the Valley High School graduation ceremony.
One of those cheering him on was Valley Principal Tim Miller. The principal and the student have been eating lunch together off and on for six years — since their time together at Stilwell Junior High.
"He is just such an amazing young guy and has a great love of life," Miller said last week. "He's got such a positive outlook on everything he does and transfers that joy to others."
Clarke's medical problems arose in elementary school after a shunt used to drain excess fluid from around his brain — he was born with a condition called hydrocephalus — became infected.
"Everything that could go wrong went wrong," said his mother, Melissa Clarke-Wharff.
Clarke had six strokes in two weeks and spent a month in a coma.
The second half of his third-grade year was spent at an inpatient medical facility. He doesn't remember much of that time, but he does remember the physical therapy he had to endure while attending fourth-grade classes part-time.
"It about emotionally about broke me," his mother said. "I got my motivation and strength from Jack. I saw he was working for this as well. I just didn't believe that he wasn't going to be able to walk."
He eventually had 38 leg surgeries to help him regain mobility.
When is been time for Clarke to move to junior high, his family met with Miller, who was principal of Stilwell at the time.
"I saw Tim's commitment to Jack. He said, 'This kid's got it, and we're going to bring it out of him,'" Clarke-Wharff said
That's when Miller and Clarke first began spending their lunch period together.
"Every lunch, he was there," Clarke said. "I didn't really know anybody else besides him. He would mingle with the students. I just found that so cool how he was able to do that."
Miller was transferred to Valley High during Clarke's eighth-grade year. But the friendship and lunches resumed two years later on Clarke's first day at Valley High.
The principal said he sits in the cafeteria each day to be accessible to students. He wasn't in the lunchroom just for Clarke, but Clarke was the bonus, he said.
"All the credit goes to Jack," Miller said. "He has a magnetism about him. Anything that people have done to help him, they've done because of the way he is."
That help — from family, friends, teachers and doctors — went a long way to getting Clarke to Sunday's graduation ceremony.
The Valley graduate is heading to Des Moines Area Community College in Ankeny next fall.
And he's already got some lunch dates planned this summer with Miller, who is retiring at the end of June.
"We'll see each other one way or another," the principal said. "We said we were going out together."

A foul-mouthed drunken man has been fined after he fell into the path of traffic and abused police officers.
Neil Theakstone, 54, of Marshall Street, Heanor, was found drunk and disorderly on Wellington Street, in Ripley, by police.
Prosecuting solicitor Becky Allsop told a Chesterfield magistrates' court hearing on Wednesday, October 5: “Officers were called out after a report of an intoxicated male urinating in the street.
“He was seen stumbling backwards and tripped over his own feet and fell into the road causing cars to take evasive action.”
Police helped Theakstone back onto his feet, according to Mrs Allsop, but he was repeatedly abusive so he had to be arrested.
Theakstone pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly in a public place after the incident on September 19.
He told the court that he has begun seeking help from the Addaction group to address his alcohol issues.
Theakstone added that he was homeless but the probation service has helped him to get accommodation.
Magistrates fined Theakstone £120 and he must also pay £85 costs and a £30 victim surcharge.
Most people familiar with "face-swapping" know it as an innocuous social media feature. An algorithm captures a person's face and pastes it onto someone else's. The result is rarely seamless and often funny.
But as it grows more sophisticated, that technology has taken a sinister turn: It's now become easier to superimpose the faces of celebrities onto those of actors in pornographic films, resulting in highly-realistic fake videos.
Deepfakes, as the digital form is called, takes its name from the Redditor "deepfakes," the first person known to create these fake porn videos. Celebrities Daisy Ridley, Gal Gadot and Taylor Swift are among deepfakes' early victims.
Samantha Cole, an editor at Motherboard, who first reported on the trend, tells NPR's Scott Simon that the videos are created using a machine-learning algorithm, which is trained by processing hundreds of photos of an individual's face.
"Someone takes a dataset of one person's face — and a lot of pictures of that person's face — and then a video that they want to put it on," Cole says. "And they run a machine-learning algorithm, train it on these two images, and after a few hours, gives you the result, which is, these very realistic, fake porn videos."
So, while well-photographed actors and actresses are easy targets, as the technology quickly becomes more advanced and accessible, not-so-famous faces are worried where they might show up online.
That's the talk of Reddit threads right now, Cole says, "Whether this can be done with people that they know or scraped from Facebook images or Instagram. It's definitely possible, if you have enough images of someone."
In fact, a new, user-friendly tool, FakeApp, democratizes the technology. FakeApp allows anyone to generate fake videos with their own datasets. Deepfakes enthusiasts have been inserting into movies the Internet's favorite face: Nicolas Cage.
Legally, though, this quickly-advancing technology has been outpacing the law. "It's all very hazy right now," Cole says. "Celebrities could sue for misappropriation of their images, like when you use a celebrity's face for an ad without their permission. But the average person has little recourse. Revenge porn laws don't include the right kind of language to cover this kind of situation."
Similar technologies have already stirred fears. Last year, journalist Nick Bilton considered the implications of adding two new manipulative mediums. He pointed to a video demonstrating technology researchers developed that allowed them to manipulate the facial expressions of world leaders, including Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.
If fabricated text-based stories can snowball into events like PizzaGate, he suggested, he left the door open for the consequences that could play out on an international stage when bad actors latch onto this technology.
"Celebrities and porn performers are two groups of people that have lots of images of themselves publicly so they're easy targets for this, but so are politicians," Motherboard's Samantha Cole says. "It's going to be difficult trying to suss out all of this in an era of fake news."

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Most people familiar with face-swapping know it as a harmless, fun feature on social media apps. An algorithm captures a person's face and places it on somebody else's head. The result is rarely seamless, and often it's pretty funny.
But face-swapping has recently been used to superimpose the faces of celebrities into pornographic films. This isn't just alarming for actors and actresses who appear to perform in movies they never made. Because the technology is more advanced and accessible, not-so-famous faces are worried where they might show up online. Is face-swapping a dark sign for online identities?
Samantha Cole is an editor at Motherboard and has been covering this. Thanks very much for being with us.
SAMANTHA COLE: Sure. Thanks for having me.
SIMON: You've seen one of these, right?
COLE: Yes. I've seen probably dozens, if not a hundred, of them by now.
SIMON: Well, you tracked down and interviewed a Reddit user who goes by the name of Deepfakes who, I guess, has created three adult films with celebrity faces, yes?
COLE: He's created probably a lot more than that, to be honest. He was the person who first posted one of these on Reddit, and his name has become the name for this form of video - these fake porn videos.
SIMON: How does it work?
COLE: So basically, it's generated using a machine-learning algorithm. So someone takes a dataset of a lot of people's - or one person's face and a lot of pictures of that person's face, and then a video that they want to put it on. And they run a machine-learning algorithm, train it on these two images. And after a few hours, it gives you the result, which is these very realistic fake porn videos.
SIMON: So hypothetically, could you take somebody's photos or videos off their social media feeds and put them into adult films?
COLE: So yes. Hypothetically, it's definitely possible if you have enough images of someone. It's not something that we've seen happen yet. But as quickly as this technology is moving, it's definitely possible.
SIMON: Is it legal? Or does anyone care?
COLE: (Laughter) I think both sides care quite a bit - the people making them and the people who are the targets of them. The legality is honestly in a very gray area. It's all very hazy right now. We're not really sure what to make of it. Celebrities could sue for misappropriation of their images, like when you use a celebrity's face for an ad without their permission - things like that. But the average person has little recourse, honestly. Revenge porn laws don't include the right kind of language to cover this situation because it's a mashup of two things.
SIMON: Yeah. Revenge porn is when someone takes a...
COLE: Right.
SIMON: ...Intimate film of someone, and they don't have their permission.
COLE: Exactly. Yeah. So this is not quite that. And that's creating a lot of problems legally and a lot of questions of how we're going to handle this.
SIMON: I have to tell you my biggest worry as a citizen is not porn but that somebody might put somebody's face - let's say - at a crime scene or in some other - you know, at a rally that you never attended or something like that.
COLE: That's definitely possible, and that's something that we're thinking about. It's splashy right now because it is porn. And celebrities and porn performers are two groups of people that have lots of images of themselves publicly out there, so they're easy targets for this. But so are politicians, you know, anyone who's on TV or on the Internet, showing their face quite a bit.
SIMON: And what about regular citizens who just have a lot of pictures and videos on social media sites? Could they be victimized, too?
COLE: I mean, it's theoretically definitely possible. You would need hundreds of pictures of someone. It's worth taking a look at your privacy settings and thinking about how you use the Internet and whether or not you're sharing your face in all these private forums.
But then again, that puts a lot of pressure on users to - for them to kind of self-regulate over platforms. And those are the ones that really need to be accountable for taking care of the people who are using these platforms and kind of regulating how people are using them and hoping that they're not for harm.
SIMON: I mean, if the solution is just don't put pictures or videos on social media platforms, that also kind of destroys the utility of social media platforms, doesn't it?
COLE: Sure. And that's definitely not - that's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying don't put pictures of yourself out there. That's an extreme solution to this. The better solution would be to have more stringent laws around revenge porn, ownership of our own images, more responsive platforms who act quickly and serve their users better.
Yeah. It's - right now, it's just easier to say think twice about your privacy settings because that's all we can do. That's all we have control of right now.
SIMON: Samantha Cole at Motherboard, thanks so much for being with us.
COLE: Thank you for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.
NEW YORK — Arizona coach Ariel Prieto and the Diamondbacks have been fined by Major League Baseball for his wearing an Apple Watch in the dugout during the NL wild-card win over Colorado.
MLB announced the discipline Friday, two days after the game.
The commissioner's office said in a statement that it interviewed Prieto and examined his watch and cellphone. It said it "found no evidence that Mr. Prieto used the Apple Watch or cellphone for any purpose in the dugout, nor any baseball-related communication on either device, during Wednesday's game."
Prieto and the team were fined because he violated a regulation, and MLB will donate the fine money to hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.

The X Factor has released a brand-new trailer ahead of it's 14th series later this year.
The clip sees Dermot O'Leary talking in rhyme about the history of the X Factor - as tons of old faces pop up, reminding viewers of memorable moments.
As Dermot speaks about the "young guy I met in the queue that time", a little Harry Styles is seen.
We're then shown shots of previous X Factor winners including James Arthur, Louisa Johnson and a baby-faced Little Mix.
Other notable faces in the advert are Olly Murs and One Direction.
As well as The X Factor success stories, the clips shows the more memorable contestants including Stevie Ritchie and Bratavio from last year's series.
Rylan Clark-Neal's infamous meltdown as Nicole Scherzinger tells him he's through to the live shows is also featured in the advert, as well as Sinitta's palm tree outfit from Simon Cowell's judges houses.
Dermot explains how this year's hopefuls will start their journey in a closed audition room in front of Simon, Nicole, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh.
They'll then have to sing in front of a live audience, before going to Boot Camp and then the Six Chair Challenge.
The X Factor advert comes just one day after the news Harry Styles is set to make a sensational return to the show where he first shot to superstardom.
(Image: ITV)
Music mogul Simon Cowell is said to be keen to get Harry performing on the live shows, according to The Sun.

Facing problems in your personal life is much like business.
April 24, 2018 6 min read
Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
I thought I was going to die.
It came down to a phone call from my doctor. He told me the procedure I went through showed the tumors they previously found were benign. Waiting for those results was one of the most intense scares of my life. I couldn't help but think of all the other crap I had to deal with before being struck with the possibility of facing death.
All of us know that you have to be a little crazy to be an entrepreneur. You push your mind and body to the max every single day. There is a huge amount of risk and an equal amount of stress that you deal with, day in and day out. Financially, mentally, emotionally and physically -- running a business can be taxing.
Plus, my passion is for helping people -- supporting my team along with mentoring other entrepreneurs. Now, what would happen if I had to set all of this aside to deal with an illness?

I had to take a step back, like I always do, and ask myself, "What is the lesson here?" I'm still alive, so there must be something I could take away from this experience and share with the world. And yes, this is super personal, but who cares? I was faced with the potential of being diagnosed with the most deadly disease of our generation. I saw that something was wrong with my body, and just like in business, when you think something is wrong, more than likely it is. With that said, there are a few lessons that this experience validated for me that I would like to share.
Trusting my gut became life or death.
If you read nothing past this line, you must take this in: We absolutely can live or die by our convictions. For years, my stomach did not feel OK, but everyone kept telling me, “You're fine.” Each time I would visit my doctor for a checkup, he would say, “Don't worry about it.” But something told me that this is urgent. That I need to fix this issue right away.
When someone has a highly regarded title or expertise in a particular industry, people will assume two things. One, that this individual has all the answers. Two, that their professional ranking trumps our own knowledge. Dealing with this health scare confirmed for me that neither of these assumptions are true. In fact, I think it's time to call bullshit.

My professional knowledge may not be extensive in health and medicine, but it's my body, and I knew something was wrong. No one could convince me differently, not even the experts. You can respect expertise but still trust your instincts.
Similarly, if you really love your business, you have to be its greatest advocate. You have to save it like you would fight to save your body. There can be no gray area in this space. So, what happens if the so-called experts do not see or understand your vision? You get tenacious about finding your own solutions.
Going by the book does not make you a winner.
I have never been one to do well with rules. I used to be a lot more reckless and just do shit and deal with the consequences later. I've matured since then, and I make sure to measure how consequences will affect myself and my team first. However, that young man who asks for forgiveness instead of permission is still within me. When I am determined to execute on my goals, persistence is my strength and what has saved me in business and now in life.
The recommended age reserved to screen for colon cancer is 50 years old. Many years younger than what is typical, I went to my doctor one last time and told him that I need to get a medical screening done. To some within my circle, including my doctor, I appeared to be a hypochondriac that spent too many hours Googling my symptoms on the web. Despite the naysayers and recommendations, I stuck to what I felt to be right for me.
If I'm going to solve problems, I solve them all.
I know you cannot handle every single problem at once, but the big problems you have to take care of. Especially when it is something future-oriented. Just like in business, I was tenacious about solving this problem.
Some of the smartest, most knowledgeable people ignore their health because they are too afraid to find out what is going on inside of them. This is ludicrous. They choose to let fear win, allowing themselves to be validated by false positives instead of getting proactive about uncovering what is wrong.

I cannot afford to ignore any problems. Cancer has riddled my family. Coincidently, both my father and stepfather have been diagnosed with bladder cancer. Thankfully, I made it through this OK. Staying on top of problems has helped position me to detect hazards early. Before they become a threat to my business or my life, I am searching for options to protect what I have built. If you wait for that terminal diagnosis, for your funds to be completely drained or to let go of the employee who is not the right fit, then it's already too late. Your ability to pivot and overcome just became seriously hampered.
No one knows your body or your business like you. People told me not to worry, and if I listened, this could have developed into a horrible situation later on in life that could not be solved with just a simple surgery. Purposely staying in the dark about anything benefits no one -- not your family, not your friends, not your team and especially not you.
Recently, a friend asked how I was doing after all of this. I am happy to now say, I feel great.
Vice President Pence Visits DMZ Amid Tensions With North Korea
Vice President Mike Pence is in South Korea. David Greene talks to Joel Wit, senior fellow at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, about North Korea.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Vice President Mike Pence is in South Korea, just across the border from a country that has rising tensions with the United States - and I mean just across the border. Pence went this morning to the demilitarized zone, where you can look into North Korea. He spoke afterwards in Seoul, keeping up the tough talk we've been hearing from President Trump. After North Korea carried out a failed missile test, Pence said the United States will not tolerate a nuclear threat from North Korea.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: We hope to achieve this objective through peaceful means, but all options are on the table. Just in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan. North Korea would do well not to test his resolve.
GREENE: I want to ask how serious all of this is. And our next guest knows North Korea well. He negotiated curbs on the country's nuclear program when he was in the State Department where he served under four different presidents. He has been studying North Korea since as a scholar and author. It's Joel Wit. Welcome to the program.
JOEL WIT: Good morning.
GREENE: So is the vice president threatening war here?
WIT: Well, I think what the vice president is doing is exactly what he said, which is showing resolve in the face of a growing North Korean nuclear threat. I don't think he's threatening war. But he's certainly ratcheting up the pressure on the North Koreans.
GREENE: You say growing threat. What exactly is the growing threat right now? How worrisome is this?
WIT: Well, it's very worrisome. And I should add that it's not new. It's been growing for a number of years now, to the point where now North Korea has a small nuclear weapons stockpile. It can put warheads on top of missiles that can at least reach targets in the region. And it's working on an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the United States. And it's working on a hydrogen bomb that, possibly, it could put on top of that.
GREENE: You said this has all been going on already. So why, in these last few weeks, have we suddenly gotten to what feels like a very tense moment? Has this been because President Trump has ratcheted up rhetoric? Is it because U.S. intelligence is suggesting that the threat has suddenly gotten worse? What's happening?
WIT: Well, it's probably a combination of all of the above. First, the threat has been growing for a while, but it's reaching a point where it's a direct threat to the United States. And by that, I mean if they can put a warhead on top of a missile that can reach the United States, that's obviously a direct threat. Secondly, President Trump has a very different approach to North Korea than President Obama, who practiced what was called strategic patience, essentially trying to put pressure on North Korea and hoping it would come back to the negotiating table. But President Trump is really ratcheting up the pressure while still keeping open the possibility of negotiations.
GREENE: You have been in meetings with North Korean officials, I mean, as a scholar, as recently as a few months ago. What windows into their thinking can you give us in how they might be responding to President Trump's approach?
WIT: Well, when I met the North Koreans a few months ago, it was just after President Trump was elected. So no one really knew what his policies would be. And the North Koreans were saying they would wait and see. They would bide their time, keep their powder dry to see what the new administration's approach would be.
As to their reaction to his new approach, I think we should not underestimate North Korea's resolve to resist pressure from the United States. From their perspective, they are a small country dealing with the world's only superpower. And to show any weakness is suicide. And that's what they believe. So they are going to react very toughly to what we're doing.
GREENE: A lot of Americans wondering whether to be nervous right now, how nervous to be. Are there signs we can look for in days, weeks, months ahead, that will tell us this is actually getting incredibly serious?
WIT: Well, there could be signs in the weeks and months ahead. One sign, which most Americans won't see, is North Korean preparations for war. I don't think we've seen any of that yet. Secondly, something we will see is that South Koreans may go to the supermarkets - empty the shelves - in preparation for war. And third, we may see a lot of foreigners in South Korea heading for the airports to get out of the country.
GREENE: OK. Well, obviously a story we'll be following very closely. Joel Wit is a senior fellow at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a former State Department official. Thanks for the time this morning.
WIT: Thank you.

The Success Of Society Run Amok: What Does 'The Purge' Say About Us?
Enlarge this image toggle caption Annette Brown/Universal Pictures Annette Brown/Universal Pictures
What if, one night a year, all crime, including murder, was legal? That's the premise of an incredibly successful horror movie franchise set in the not-so-distant dystopian future. The idea of The Purge is: Let people blow off steam, and crime rates will go down. The fourth Purge installment — The First Purge — opens July 4.
The Purge films have, on average, made almost 2,000 percent at the worldwide box office. What is it about these stories of society-run-amok that keeps audiences coming back?
"It's a cool idea," says Grady Hendrix, an expert on horror literature and film. And cool ideas in movies can be hard to come by, so "when you find one, you may as well make as many sequels as you can," he says.
The Purge movies are in the tradition of the urban menace movies that were big in the 1970s, Hendrix explains — think Death Wish or Taxi Driver. The idea, Hendrix says, is that "our cities are just these horrible death traps and the second you let your guard down you'll get murdered by weirdos."
At a moment when gentrification has changed the conversation about crime on city streets, the power of The Purge also derives from an older horror trope — the idea of blood sacrifice — played out in The Hunger Games series and Shirley Jackson's classic short story "The Lottery." The idea is that "for a society to be healthy, you just have to kill people sometimes," Hendrix says.
The politics of The Purge haven't exactly been subtle. In one, the heroine is a crusading senator who calls out the National Rifle Association and insurance companies for profiting from the Purge.
In a 2013 promotional interview about the first Purge film, writer James DeMonaco says he purposefully made the backstory shadowy. "We kind of say that America was starting to crumble — crime, poverty, stock market crash, many wars — so everything kind of went haywire. [A] new government regime came in and got us back on track by creating the Purge."
There are no safe spaces. Your house isn't safe, your store isn't safe, your family isn't safe. There is nowhere you can go to get away from, or be protected from, someone who wants to get at you.
The worst villains in the series tend to be wealthy elites who enjoy private manhunts and deem certain citizens — such as homeless people or political opponents — expendable in their "spring cleaning."
"Survival is the most important thing," Hendrix says, and that message resonates when so many people struggle just to make ends meet. In a climate where "safe safes" are frequently ridiculed, the Purge is literally about having no space that feels safe: "There are no safe spaces," Hendrix says. "Your house isn't safe, your store isn't safe, your family isn't safe. There is nowhere you can go to get away from, or be protected from, someone who wants to get at you."
Numerous polls have found that Americans are feeling more divided than ever — so a story about losing common humanity feels relevant. Regardless of politics, The Purge movies share a sense of a decay of the American dream, and if horror movies serve as catharsis — and The Purge films live up to their name.
May's announcement comes in the wake of the latest YouGov poll for the London Times newspaper showing her Conservatives have a huge lead with 44 percent, well ahead of Labour on 23 percent, the Liberal Democrats on 12 percent and UKIP on 10 percent.

She told reporters: "Britain is leaving the EU and there can be no turning back". She said she wanted a "strong and successful EU and a UK that is free to chart its way in the world."
Her decision — against her initial opinion — to call a snap election, June 8, goes against the Fixed Term Parliamentary Act, which stipulates that parliaments must run for five years. She will need a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons, which she is likely to get.
She said that following the In-Out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, which resulted in the UK leaving the EU — she wanted a strong mandate from parliament to give her more authority in negotiating with Brussels.
She has picked a good time for an election with the main opposition party — Labour — embroiled in major disputes — largely over its leader Jeremy Corbyn, who does not have the support of many of his own MPs.

Nearly 26,000 members of the British Labour party have resigned since the summer, according to leaked data, with thousands leaving following the decision by party leader Jeremy Corbyn to demand all his MPs back the Brexit bill, taking Britain out of the EU.
Corbyn had been heavily criticized for having been a long-time euroskeptic who led a lackluster campaign for Britain to remain in the EU — in the run-up to the referendum, June 23, 2016 — as it was official Labour Party policy to remain in the union.
However, Labour is split over the issue, with many pro-EU MPs representing constituencies where the majority voted to leave the EU. Meanwhile, many young Labour supporters — who voted to remain — have deserted the party because of Corbyn's poor performance in the run-up to the referendum.

Theresa May — who is known as the 'Ice Woman' because of her famously distant, seemingly cold nature — has now taken the moment to go back to the country and gain a mandate for her version of Brexit.
In doing so, she is calling the bluff on Labour, but also gaining a mandate — likely with an increased majority — to silence the opposition to Brexit from the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP), which has threatened to oppose her in the Brussels negotiations.
If — as expected — she wins a landslide election, she will be able to silence those who have threatened to water down her version of a 'Hard Brexit.' It would be very difficult for opposition parties to oppose her in the wake of the In-Our referendum — which voted out of the EU — as well as her increased majority in the Commons.
Theresa May has shown that she is tough and prepared to go back to the country and seek a mandate for her version of Brexit. It will also send a strong message to Brussels that she can talk tough and is no pushover when it comes to playing politics.

Most people don't wake up ready to start the day like Snow White singing to her helpful little birds. Most days you get caught up in the hustle and bustle and have to push through, and then, there are the bad days when you're just not feeling it.

The alarm goes off late. Your forehead is pounding, and your body feels like a semi-truck has hit it. Your computer crashes and destroys your assignment hours before the deadline. Your supervisor has taken micromanagement to the next level. You have to work through lunch, and it's not even the afternoon yet.
Everyone has one of those days. You may feel like it's your fault, but it's not. Most of the time, these stressful situations are outside of your control, but you can monitor, accept and reset your reactions. To get started, try these five tips for how to handle a bad work day.
1. Eliminate work-related stress
Want to know what the number one stressor is for Americans? Job stress. Today, 65 percent of Americans experience work-related stress, while one-third of people deal with chronic work-related stress.
To cut off the stress, ask yourself questions: What's important? What's not important? Start with the simplest tasks to get your confidence back and get into a groove of productivity. Then, create new deadlines that are realistic for you to accomplish, and if you're stretching yourself too thin, consider talking to management about reducing your workload.
2. Communicate with your boss
Your boss might carry the most pressure of all and sometimes, let that stress trickle down the work pipe to employees. Your boss' lousy day could be every day, or maybe your communication styles clash to the detriment of your work relationship. To improve your relationship with your supervisor, try to communicate through their communication style. Here are four types:
Analytical -- This communication style prefers real numbers and hard data. You should avoid vague language and be specific when talking to this person.

Intuitive -- This communication style focuses on the big picture and tends to avoid getting caught up in the details. They already know the answer and want to hear it. Cut to the chase. Give a more generalized overview of the situation and end on a solid conclusion.

Personal -- This communication style values connection and emotional languages over “cold” communication that's focused on data. They like going deep and finding the cause and are likely to enjoy getting to know their colleagues on a deeper level.

Train yourself to speak in your boss' communication style. Don't change your personality and style entirely because your style gives you unique strengths, but talking in another communication style is like perfecting a second language and comes in handy.
On terrible days, it's best to get out of your boss' way, no matter who's having the worst day. Stay cordial, punctual and keep verbal communication brief and professional. Email may be best if you have to update them.
3. Avoid co-worker politics
Co-worker drama and office politics also affect your productivity. When drama takes its toll, it may be time to contact your company's human resources team about your concerns and how it's affecting your ability to do your job.
Otherwise, do your best to stay out of it because you're not in high school anymore, even though your co-workers didn't get that memo. If they do try to drag you into their drama, don't let them. If you feel tempted, keep these tips in mind:
Don't vent while at work.
When you feel frustrated, wait to reply. Don't get passive-aggressive.
If you think they will be open to it, try to talk to your co-worker about how their negative behavior affects your job.
Cut gossip out at the root. Say, “Sorry, I can't help you with that.” Declare you're on a deadline and get back to it.
Keeping out of co-worker drama also lets you focus on doing your job, which makes you look good.
4. Take care of personal troubles
Work-life balance is all about being able to keep your professional and personal lives separate, right? Not exactly. Lousy news easily upsets the balance, and it's hard to stay focused when it feels like everything's been turned upside down.
Ask yourself if you can press on with your duties or if you need a day to reset. You don't have to spill all the beans to your boss or human resources team, but ask if you can shift some of your duties or take a half day because of the bad news you've received.

5. Rest when sick
In the colder season, illness strikes and gets passed around like a puppy. If you don't take care of yourself or take time off, your recovery time will be longer.
If you have to work, come with your healthcare kit and keep a distance from co-workers. Tell them you may be coming down with something. Communicating by phone or email is another helpful tactic. Don't assume that your boss won't let you take a half day or work from home -- always ask.
When you're feeling awful, just take a sick day. It's better for your health and everyone else's.
Remember, most circumstances that contribute to terrible days are outside of your control, and everyone has an off day. Let yourself accept it. Take a step back, breathe and focus on resetting. The next moment is a new one. You've got this.

Snow days mean one of two things for unprepared Brits – a sofa day in front of the television, or a scramble for the nearest sledge (or plastic plate) on a dash to the closest park.
But this Bristol duo were required to think outside of the box when left sledge-less on a snowy day in the centre of town.
The video shows the pair race down Brandon Hill near Park Street, one in a bright orange parachute-style anorak, with the other perched bravely on top.

Prepped for action, the video shows the two, with arms spread out, dash down the slushy hill airplane-style.
The park's snowy leftovers meant the couple whizzed down, attracting the park's amused passers-by.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been an enthusiastic leader on environmental issues. In areas ranging from renewable energy capacity building to capping coal-driven power plants and curbing emissions, he has set ambitious targets. Given that India is the third-largest polluter from carbon emissions, such ambition is important. But ensuring sustainable development will need recalibration of our current understanding of progress.
With growing population and rising incomes, the challenge of the second half of the century will likely be sustainability, not poverty. This is not to trivialize the importance of growth today. About a billion people still live in poverty and improving their lives is of paramount importance. But it is increasingly becoming clear that a focus on growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to the exclusion of all else can sacrifice the interests of future generations.
The problem with such a single-minded focus is that it fixates on aggregate demand, irrespective of whether it is due to greater consumption or investment. Usually, durable investments do increase with GDP, but that is not necessarily true for natural capital. In fact, GDP can increase dramatically by exploiting natural capital. Given the absence of asset valuation in GDP calculations, debt is irrelevant. The contract with future generations, thus, is that greater future wealth will finance this debt. The future growth that is assumed, however, depends on the sustainability of natural capital, which is threatened due to the myopic pursuit of GDP growth.
One could argue that it is not the stock of assets but the economic value of assets that needs to be maintained. Since a forest can be converted into a farm, that seems to be the efficient use of the resource. This logic is sound, unless overuse starts threatening the sustainability of the forest itself. The problem is that there is no accounting for where those thresholds are, and whether the current rate of resource-use is sustainable.
Secondly, the marginal approach—that asks, “What is the optimal size of a rainforest?”—is incompatible with how complex ecosystems work. A rainforest is more than the sum of acres of trees. It provides habitat for different animals which support the ecosystem with host-prey relationships. The balance is easily threatened, and an ecosystem can quickly go pear-shaped before we understand how.
Usually, the process of change is slow enough for evolution to take place. Species evolve in response to changing climate and competition. But the pace of environmental damage today is such that scientists think 50% of species are facing extinction. This should make even those who are sceptical about obligations to future generations think about sustainability. The consequences of environmental degradation will start affecting immediate generations after all, not only those far in the future. This poses a challenge where the preferences of future people have to be represented in current policy decisions. Thinking about what inheritance will be left to future generations requires an asset-based approach.
The national income accounts tell us nothing about the state of our assets, especially natural capital. If the question is, “are we better off than last year?”, we must measure whether the state of assets, net of borrowing, has gone up or not.
The ethical rule guiding policy actions can be borrowed from Dieter Helm's book Natural Capital: Valuing the Planet. He proposes an aggregate capital rule which requires that the aggregate level of natural capital should not decrease. The rule implies that any renewable natural capital that is destroyed should be compensated for with improvements in other renewable capital, and that rents from the exhaustion of non-renewable natural assets (such as oil and minerals) should lead to the creation of a natural capital fund.
The non-renewable capital stock is relatively easy to value. It is also less scarce than it is made out to be. The availability of non-renewables has increased, even as China's economy has grown at 10% for three decades. In the case of oil, for example, rising prices have incentivised the development of energy-efficient technologies, offshore drilling and fracking, making it likely that we might leave oil in the ground before moving to alternative fuels.
Renewables, on the other hand, are difficult to put a value on. They regenerate automatically, so their marginal cost is zero, and the benefits are free, and thus infinite. The risk, however, is that if they're exhausted, they are permanently gone. This concern is felt most palpably for the groundwater table in north Indian states where reckless farming of water-intensive crops has depleted groundwater reserves. But it is true as well for tropical rainforests, mangroves, corals, timber, soil and fish stocks. Thus, it is important to establish threshold limits for renewable natural capital, and maintain the stock well above the threshold.
Substitution between natural capital and man-made capital is an inevitable part of economic development. But an audit of natural assets, thresholds for ecosystems at the global, national and regional level, and the sharing of rents from non-renewable resources with future generations will incentivise us to figure out the least-polluting ways of economic development, and help agents internalize the costs where destruction is inevitable. This will be a radical improvement from the status quo, where sustainable development is a platitude that has little meaning in practice.

Could Probiotics Protect Kids From A Downside Of Antibiotics?

It's a typical hectic morning at Michele Comisky's house in Vienna, Va., when she gets a knock on her front door.
"Hi, how are you?" Comisky says as she greets Keisha Herbin Smith, a research assistant at Georgetown University. "Come on in."
Comisky, 39, leads Herbin Smith into her kitchen.
"Which one isn't feeling good?" asks Herbin Smith, glancing at Comisky's children. "That one," Comisky says, pointing to her 8-year-old son, Jackson.
Jackson has an ear infection. So he just started 10 days of antibiotics to kill the strain of bacteria that's giving him an earache. That's why Herbin Smith's here.
"What time did he take his antibiotic?" Herbin Smith asks.
He asks because the antibiotics won't just wipe out the bad bacteria. They could also disrupt the good bacteria in Jackson's body, which can lead to stomach problems, including severe diarrhea.
Herbin Smith had rushed to Comisky's house to deliver a special yogurt drink that scientists are testing in hopes of preventing those serious problems.
"We want him to take the first yogurt within 24 hours of taking his first antibiotic," she says.
The yogurt contains a probiotic — a living strain of bacteria that researchers think could help prevent diarrhea and other complications of the antibiotic.
Some previous research has hinted that probiotics could help, and some doctors already are recommending probiotics to parents of children taking antibiotics.
But researchers hope the new yogurt study will provide clearer evidence as to whether that's a good idea. It's the first large, carefully designed test of a probiotic to get reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, says Dr. Daniel Merenstein, who is leading the study. He's the director of research programs in the department of family medicine at Georgetown University.
"The problem with a lot of probiotic research is that they haven't always been the best of studies," Merenstein says. "Many are done by industry. Many were done in other countries. We're looking to see if it actually prevents diarrhea in kids."
Merenstein's study is part of an explosion of interest in research on the microbiome — the billions of friendly bacteria, yeast and other microorganisms that live in the human body. There's mounting evidence these microbes play important roles in human health.

In addition to helping prevent diarrhea in children taking antibiotics, there is some evidence that probiotics could help prevent complications from antibiotics in adults as well, and might help prevent gastrointestinal infections that sometimes occur when people travel to other countries. Other people have suggested probiotics might help treat vaginal infections in women, or possibly alleviate colic in infants or perhaps prevent eczema in some babies. Probiotics are also being looked at as a possibility to prevent a serious condition in newborn babies — necrotizing enterocolitis.
Some researchers even argue there's enough evidence to recommend that healthy adults take a probiotic regularly to help maintain their health.
"I think there's a generic benefit in ingesting high numbers of safe, live bacteria every day," says Colin Hill, a professor of microbiology at University College Cork in Ireland. "If I had my way, there would be a recommended daily allowance of bacteria."
But many scientists question whether there's enough evidence to support that suggestion or the many claims some companies are making about the alleged benefits probiotics. Some products are being promoted to help prevent obesity, heart disease and even alleviate mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.

"The marketing of every claim under the sun with every product under the sun is definitely questionable," says Linda Duffy, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. "There's not much in the way a magic bullet anywhere."
The net benefit of probiotic use with certain conditions "is looking very, very promising," she says. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions.
While probiotics are probably safe for most otherwise healthy people, Duffy and others note that the products could pose some risk for people with weakened immune systems, such as those infected with the AIDS virus or for people undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
Another caution is that probiotics are not regulated as closely as prescription and over-the-counter medications. So there's no guarantee that what's on the label is actually in the bottle — or that whatever organisms were originally in the bottle are still alive. There are also concerns about potentially dangerous contaminants in products that could pose a risk even to healthy people.
"Are there contaminants out there? Are there adulterated products? Are there marketed products without the appropriate claims? Absolutely," Duffy says. "Like anything, you have to be a wise consumer."
For his part, Merenstein hopes his study will provide strong new evidence that probiotics provide benefits for children taking antibiotics.
In the study, 300 children will drink specially made strawberry yogurt. Half will drink yogurt that contains a probiotic called bifidobacterium. The researchers will then compare the incidence of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems in the two groups of kids.
In addition, the researchers are gathering fecal samples from the children to try to determine exactly how probiotics might work.
"One of our goals is to show that taking a probiotic will get your microbiome back to what it was before you started the antibiotic — and/or protect you from the changes," Merenstein says.
So, back at Comisky's house, Jackson takes his first gulp of Merenstein's special yogurt.
"All right, here you go — you can drink it right out of here," Comisky says as she takes a bottle out of the refrigerator, opens the cap and hands it to her son.
"Is it good?" she asks.
"Yeah," says Jackson, as he gulps down the yogurt and declares: "Done!"
It will take years for Merenstein's team to gather and analyze the results of the study. So it will be a while before they can say for sure whether this particular probiotic treatment works or not.
The Miami-Dade Goodwill Ambassadors assisted Miami Beach Police Department officers from May 24 through Monday, Memorial Day. Their duties ranged from educating beach goers on the City of Miami Beach ordinance, crowd monitoring, assisting police officers with traffic duties, issuing identification wristbands to minors and adults with special needs, and more.

× St. Louis alderwoman robbed at gunpoint; suspects arrested
ST. LOUIS – The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office charged an East St. Louis man for allegedly robbing a St. Louis alderwoman and a friend over the weekend.
According to court documents, the robbery happened in the 2800 block of Michigan Avenue, located in the Tower Grove East neighborhood.
Alderwoman Christine Ingrassia was sitting on the front of the residence with a friend when they were approached by two young men in dark clothing. Both men were armed and demanded property from Ingrassia and her friend. The alderwoman gave her cellphone to the suspects. Her friend handed over $20.
Ingrassia contacted police, who were able to track the alderwoman's cellphone, which led them to arrest 22-year-old Dinish Watson and 20-year-old Candree Atkins. Police said Watson was armed at the time of his arrest and that he had Ingrassia's phone with him. Police also located a second firearm in the vehicle the two men were driving.
Watson and Atkins were both charged with counts of first-degree robbery and two counts of armed criminal action. They remain in custody on $150,000 cash-only bonds.
Alderwoman Ingrassia said she's incredibly grateful to police and how they responded. She remains committed to finding ways to support the youth in St. Louis and their families to prevent violent crimes like this from happening.

Bristol Rovers will be looking to go seven-unbeaten when they take on promotion-chasing Shrewsbury Town at home this weekend.
Darrell Clarke's side head into the match on the back of that hugely impressive 3-1 win at Doncaster Rovers last Saturday, a result that saw them move into the top-half of the table.
Shrewsbury Town ended their two-match winless run with a 1-0 victory at Portsmouth last time out.
Whilst Shrewsbury Town are just one point behind 2nd placed Blackburn with a game in hand, the Gas are eight points outside the play-offs despite having not lost since before Christmas.
An unbeaten six-match run has seen Rovers propel up the table into 11th, and a win on Saturday could see them sit as high as 9th.
What time is kick off and how can I keep up to date with the match?
The match kicks off at 3pm on Saturday February 3rd at the Memorial Stadium. If you're unable to get down to the Mem, you can keep up-to-date with all the match day build-up, action and reaction with our live blog here.
Tickets for the match will be available on the gate on the day on the terrace.
How is Rovers' recent form?
Excellent, since their defeat to Doncaster Rovers on December the 23, they have gone on a six-match unbeaten run. That spell includes three wins and three consecutive away draws as the Gas have stopped leaking goals and developed an ability to comeback from behind as the wins against Doncaster Rovers and Bradford City showed.
The comeback last weekend against Doncaster saw Clarke's side move up the table and increase their chances of pushing for a play-off spot.
And what about Shrewsbury?
As mentioned, Paul Hurst's side are third in the league and are just a single point behind Blackburn Rovers. Since their defeat to Tony Mowbray's side, they've picked up four points from their last six to keep pace with the top two.
Those points came in a 2-2 draw at home to Doncaster and 1-0 win down on the south-coast against Portsmouth last weekend. Despite Rovers having scored five more than the Shrews this season, they have only conceded 20 from their 28 league games and will be difficult to breakdown.
What is the team news?
Rovers are still likely to be without right-back Dan Leadbitter who injured his hamstring against Walsall on Boxing Day. While defender James Clarke, who hasn't played since the first match of the season, is still missing.
Defender Rollin Menayese has joined Swindon Town on loan until the end of the season and club captain Tom Lockyer, who signed a new deal during the window, remains a doubt.
However, a debut is expected for deadline day signing Tony Craig. The defender joins as a free agent following his release from Championship side Millwall.
Shrewsbury meanwhile are still without defender Junior Brown as he continues his recovery from a serious cruciate knee ligament injury, and Louis Dodds, who has left the club by mutual consent.
The shrews made three deadline day signings that could all feature at the Memorial Stadium on Saturday.
Abo Eisa joined the club from Wealdstone FC, Nathan Thomas arrived on-loan from Sheffield United and attacking midfielder Sam Jones joined the club from Grimsby Town. All could feature against Rovers.
What happened the last time the two sides met?
The reverse fixture saw Shrewsbury run out 4-0 winners against Rovers at New Meadow in October.
A stunning first-half display from the hosts saw them race into a 4-0 lead before half-time.
Goals from Alex Rodman, Carlton Morris, Jon Nolan and Junior Brown complied the misery for Rovers.
Despite a spirited second-half, the Gas returned to the west country empty handed.
There's no doubt Darrell Clarke and his side will want to exact revenge on the side that handed them their biggest defeat of the season so far.
What are the odds?
Bristol Rovers 32/21
Draw 27/11
Shrewsbury 21/10

Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has revealed dramatic details about a recent altercation which saw her 'brutally beaten' by a man as she was being given a lift home by a friend of a friend, following a night out in London.
The former Big Brother star spoke about the night out in Shoreditch, as she urged a mystery witness to come forward, who holds important details about the unidentified man who beat her.
Speaking to The Sun, the reality TV star said she's been left in "a lot of pain" after she was allegedly punched repeatedly by the thug, while he was being egged on by a friend to "hit her", after she jumped into the car when her taxi didn't turn up.
(Image: Rex Features)
She told the publication: “So a guy who I was with said he'd wait for me and make sure I was ok, but when the taxi didn't come and it was absolutely freezing, he said, ‘Let me see if my friend will drop you as he's going to north London.'
“When we went around the corner to ask, he said ‘OK', but didn't really want to, so I got into the back of this car that only had two doors – so I was stuck behind the guy that started hitting me.
(Image: REX)
“He moved his chair back and told me to move. So I moved, then he said, ‘Move you f***ing slag' so I told him to f*** off', then he turned around, undid his seatbelt and started battering me, it was horrific.”
The 38-year-old added that while one of the occupants of the all-male car tried to help - assumed to be her friend mentioned earlier - while another encouraged the beating.
Following the alleged attack she was forced out of the car, and felt safe only to exit the car once she heard police sirens - although they didn't stop.
(Image: Instagram)
Aisleyne hopes by speaking out about the attack she'll encourage a woman to come forward who witnessed the attack, and attempted to stop it after climbing into the back of the car with her.
The reality star said: “She was saying, ‘I've seen it, I've seen everything you did to her, I'm calling the police, I'm calling the police.'
“I gave her my phone number but my phone was off for quite a while and she hasn't called or text since it's been on."
She added on Instagram: "Help me find her please (the female witness).... The woman beater (a ‘man') must be held accountable."
Since telling her story, she's warned her attacker she's coming for him.
She said on Instagram: "To my attacker: You flipped the b*tch switch, so buckle up and enjoy the ride, a**hole! I'm coming for you."

Heavy flood water tearing through the Lismore CBD in April this year.
Heavy flood water tearing through the Lismore CBD in April this year. Marc Stapelberg
SIX months on from the devastating March flood, there has been a deafening silence from community leaders about moves to flood-proof Lismore.
And it will be at least another three months until it will return to the council's agenda.
This week's two-day Lismore Flood Ready project charrette conversations about mobilising recovery volunteers and innovative technologies highlighted the absence of mitigation measures.
The possibility of raising the levee and other infrastructure changes were left out of this week's community conversations at Lismore City Council.
Executive director sustainable development Brent McAlister said raising the levee was "outside of the scope" of the two-day workshop.
"We were very much focused on volunteer management, flood preparedness and things we can address immediately, not the flood levee issue," Mr McAlister said.
"It's not been a priority at this point in time and there is no timeframe per say."
However, Mr McAlister suggested it would be on the council's agenda after Christmas.
Now the workshop has concluded, Page MP Kevin Hogan said it was crucial to focus on flood mitigation.
While he noted on-going work at Rous County Council and Southern Cross University, Mr Hogan said it was crucial the community and all relevant agencies prioritised flood management.
"It's imperative that we continue to do this, on-going conversations with relevant local authorities because I want us to come up with a flood management plan, it's that simple," Mr Hogan said.
"We are getting to the point where we need to have a rough timetable and what is our outlook."
Mr Hogan canvassed the possibility of compiling a strategy by next year to take to the State and Federal governments to acquire funding.
"I would like to think within 12-18 months post the flood, in another 6-12 months, that we as a local community, we as Rous County Council, we as a university, we as a local government have discussed looked at different flood mitigation proposals and have come up with the one that we think works," he said.
"While I don't think we should be held to that timetable, I do think we need to move as quickly as we can because we can't discuss these things forever.
"The law of averages means we are going to flood eventually again one day so we need to come up with a flood mitigation plan and strategy as quickly as we can."
Lismore MP Thomas George said he didn't think flood mitigation would be discussed because measures such as raising the levee needed to have expert input, planning and direction.
He was confident those discussions would happen in the very near future.
Lismore Mayor Isaac Smith was contacted for comment but did not respond before deadline.

NORMAN, Okla. — Iowa State starting quarterback Jacob Park has taken a personal leave from the team and his return is unknown, the Register has learned.
Park is still on the team, Iowa State officials confirmed to the Register, but will not play Saturday — and potentially beyond — as he deals with unspecified medical issues.
“Jacob is a great young man dealing with some personal medical concerns,” Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said in a statement first obtained by the Register on Friday. “We are committed to helping him cope, supporting him on all levels and helping him prepare to get back on the playing field with his teammates as soon as possible.”
It's unknown at the moment who will take over for Park as the starting QB.
Campbell was not certain of a timeline for Park's return. In the release, he noted that he cannot discuss medical issues pertaining to his players.
“We are focused on helping Jacob in any way we can,” Campbell said. “I know how important the football team is to Jacob and how important Jacob is to the football team. But supporting one another in difficult times is where we need to be.”
Park, a redshirt junior, has thrown for 1,181 yards, nine touchdowns and five interceptions this season. He's coming off his worst performance of the season when he completed just 24 of 48 passes for 246 yards and three interceptions in a loss to Texas.

Park did not travel with the team for Iowa State's Big 12 Conference contest with No. 3 Oklahoma on Saturday. Campbell has previously refuted rumors that Park is suspended.
A former blue-chip recruit, Park began his college career at Georgia. He transferred to Trident Technical College in South Carolina — a school that doesn't even have a football program, keeping in shape by playing in a church football league with friends. Park later attended Northeast Oklahoma A&M, where he attended school and joined the football team, but never played.

The 2016 season began with Park on the bench as starter Joel Lanning's backup. The two eventually shared snaps before Park took over the starting spot at the end of the season.
Park entered this season as the clear-cut starter and the centerpiece of Campbell's rebuild at Iowa State. The Cyclones had so much faith in him that they moved Lanning to linebacker, leaving unknowns Zeb Noland and Kyle Kempt as his top back-ups.
Park, who became a father in the offseason, talked about how important it was for him to succeed and achieve his dream of playing in the NFL.
“Me having a kid, I have to make it to that step or my life won't be the way I want it to be,” Park said in an interview with the Register in March. “It's coming down to almost a do-or-die situation, and I can't fail.”
After a strong start to the season, Park struggled against the Longhorns last week and was emotional on the sidelines. Campbell stood by Park during his weekly press conference in Ames on Monday.
“I don't worry too much about Jacob Park,” Campbell said at the time. “He's got a nice little swagger about him. I think he'll be ready to rock and roll.”
By Friday, though, Park was away from the team.
Noland has played just one game and failed to complete the lone pass he's thrown. Kempt played in just one game this season at Akron.
Kempt has the most experience of the two. He began his career at Oregon State and transferred to Hutchinson Community College. Kempt played in two games last season, completing both of his 2 passes, for 15 yards.
Then there's Lanning, who is listed as a starter at middle linebacker but also got playing time on offense this season.

They say that deaths often come in twos on soaps - and that was certainly the case this week after murderer Emma Barton suffered a grisly fate.
Emmerdale viewers watched tonight as Emma plunged from the bridge and died after finding out that she had accidentally killed her own son Finn.
In harrowing scenes tonight, Emma found out the consequences of her actions via radio.
Earlier this year, actress Gillian Kearney had told Emmerdale boss Iain McLeod that she wanted to leave the soap. Upon hearing this and also finding out that actor Joe Gill also wished to leave, Iain concocted the tragic downfall of Emma which resulted in her death.

"I feel very lucky that I've managed to bow out in such style," Gillian said. "We had a great time last year and then we had a similar fiasco this year. The crew has been amazing to work with - everybody works so hard at Emmerdale and it's been great to be part of a team."
She admitted that her big standout memory was last year during the crash, stunt-filled extravaganza.
But her and Bill Ward (James Barton)'s scenes had a decidedly sinister, horror-type edge to it.

In particular, most fans will remember THAT famous scene which saw her wearing a white wedding dress as she kept husband James hostage.
As he sat tied to a chair, she was seen holding a slaughtered chicken in one hand with blood dripping down her dress.
"I really enjoyed last year, it was fabulous," she said. Speaking about when she had to hold the chicken, she said: "When I drove off to the set I didn't realise it was going to be a real chicken... but it had real feathers and it had just been killed by a farmer an hour before. That was a memory!"
When asked what her next ideal role now would be, she admitted that she'd like to play someone a little more stable.
"I'd like to play a character who's a bit more secure and not fragile," she admitted.

Turkish forces bombed Islamic State targets in Syria hours after an ISIS gunman murdered 39 people at an Istanbul nightclub .
Warplanes carried out air strikes near the Islamic State-controlled town of Al-Bab on New Year's Day, Turkey's military confirmed on Monday.
The Turkish chief of general staff's office said Turkish jets struck eight IS group targets while tanks and artillery fired upon 103 targets near Al Bab, killing 22 extremists while destroying many structures, according to Turkish-run Anadolu Agency.
The latest offensive came as Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on Reina nightclub that saw 69 people injured and 39 killed on January 1.

The killer reportedly 'screamed Allahu Akbar' as he stormed into the club with an AK-47 and began blasting people at will.
Islamic State said in a statement today the attack was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.
While Turkish authorities have refused to comment on whether the air strikes are linked to the attack, Turkey's deputy prime minister said it was clear that the country's military incursion into Syria had upset terror groups.

However, deputy PM Numan Kurtulmus said the offensive would continue until all threats to Turkey were removed.
Footage released by Turkish army today showed air strikes on Syrian towns of Al-Bab, Tadif and Bzagah.
The Turkish military operation, dubbed 'Euphrates Shield', was launched more than four months ago to drive Islamic State militants away from the border region and in recent weeks the forces have been besieging the town of Al-Bab.
Russian jets are also believed to have attacked ISIS targets in Dayr Kak, five miles to the southwest of Al-Bab.
Turkey sent tanks and special forces into Syria just over four months ago to push back Islamic State militants from its border and prevent Kurdish militia fighters from taking ground in their wake.
Security services had been on alert across Europe for new year celebrations following an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people .
Only days ago, an online message from a pro-Islamic State group called for attacks by "lone wolves" on "celebrations, gatherings and clubs".
As new images of the Istanbul nightclub suspect are released, Mr Kurtulmus told a news conference: “Information about the fingerprints and basic appearance of the terrorist have been found.

ISIS released a statement this morning, that said a 'heroic soldier' had attacked Reina nightclub on New Year's Day.
Police have released new CCTV stills of the suspected ‘Istanbul gunman, with initial reports suggesting he may be aged 25 and come from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.

The suspect is a member of the East Turkestan branch of ISIS , according to Turkish media reports.
Officers are also investigating the possibility that the attacker may be from Xinjiang in eastern China.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump's plan to combat opioid drug addiction nationwide calls for stiffer penalties for drug traffickers, including the death penalty where appropriate under current law. That from a top administration official.
It's a fate for drug dealers that Trump, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has been highlighting publicly in recent weeks.
Trump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain illicit opioids. Trump's domestic policy director, Andrew Bremberg, briefed reporters Sunday on the plan Trump is scheduled to unveil Monday in New Hampshire, a state hard-hit by the crisis.

Teddy Sheringham has some unusual advice for Leicester City, as they look to turn their disastrous season around - "go out, have a drink, get drunk... have a little fight".
The Manchester United and Tottenham legend made his comment while talking on Astro SuperSport's EPL Live coverage show, in Malaysia, which you can see above.
In the clip Sheringham discusses the fall of the Foxes, who sit one point off the relegation zone, a season after clinching the Premier League title.
And suggests the players need to get their problems out in the open if they want to resurrect their campaign and avoid dropping into the Championship.

"They need to have a get together [the players]," says Sheringham.
"Go and have a drink on a Tuesday or something, get drunk, have a few words amongst each other, a few fingers being pointed.
"Maybe have a little scuffle, have a little fight, upset each other, get it all out in the open.
"Tell each other that they're not doing enough on the pitch, every one of them, and sort it out, because at the moment I think they are a little bit of an embarrassment towards Leicester City."

The Foxes have lost their last five fixtures in the Premier League and are in real danger of going down this season.
Their last win in the league came at home to West Ham in December and they face Liverpool next after games with Millwall and Sevilla in the FA Cup and Champions League respectively.
The Tax bill that recently passed the House and the proposal to be voted on by the Senate has been sold to the American Public as, get this, the “Tax Reform and Jobs Act.” Just go online to find the celebratory photo of the House appropriations committee members, all Republicans, and you'll see the slogan affixed to the podium. It's a slick piece of advertising designed to disguise what this legislation is really all about – a massive corporate tax cut demanded by the Republican donor base – the billionaire class who have bluntly told the Republicans in Congress if they don't cut corporate taxes they (the billionaires) will no longer fund those Republican's races for elective office. As Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said recently, “It's all about the donors – essentially four or five billionaire families who are calling the shots!”
The whole effort by the Republican-led congress and White House is to get a “victory” – to demonstrate they can govern and get something done. However, it is noteworthy the House bill was crafted behind closed doors with no public hearings and with not a single Democratic vote. While we hear a lot of chatter from supporters of the tax plan about how “everyone” will have a tax cut, when you study the fine print, you see individuals at the low and middle income level get a minimum cut in taxes that is inconsequential; higher individuals get a bigger break – but these tax cuts will expire in 10 years while corporate tax reduction is permanent!
So what about “jobs” that will be created by all the money corporations will have since their tax rate will be reduced? That is pure myth. The U.S. has been losing jobs in the ever increasing global economy for years. Why? Corporations want to make their products paying the lowest wage possible and without expensive worker benefits. Is it realistic to think because a corporation has saved on its taxes it is going to build a plant in the U.S. and pay higher wages? Or, is it more realistic to think the money saved in taxes will go towards buying back shares and increased value to shareholders by paying higher dividends. If you think the former, I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn.
Also, if you think reducing taxes will stimulate the economy, with the benefits of lower taxes trickling down to the middle class, I have two things to say. There is no empirical evidence “trickle down” economics has ever worked. Take a look at what happened in Kansas when Republican Governor Sam Brownback slashed taxes – the state's economy went into a severe nose-dive and the legislature had to raise taxes to keep essential services going and override his veto of the tax increase. There are now four Republicans trying to replace him.
What is truly insidious about these tax proposals is what is being cut from revenue to pay for the corporate tax cuts – $1.5 trillion over ten years! For example, the proposal to eliminate or reduce the state and local tax deduction (SALT) will have an impact on housing across the country and raise taxes on the middle class by up to 26 percent, if they can no longer deduct those taxes. There are many tax credits that are poised to be eliminated such as tax exempt municipal bonds that cities and towns have successfully used to pay for infrastructure improvements – if the tax exempt status is eliminated, cities will have to pay more interest on borrowing which ultimately is paid for by local taxes; same thing for low income housing credit and new markets tax credit – both are vehicles to get private investment into low income housing. Eliminate the credit (incentive) and it will be much harder to encourage private sector involvement in building low income housing which significantly contributes to making lives better for deserving people that are not fortunate enough to be in the wealthy class, let alone middle class.
The National League of Cities, of which Pinecrest is a member and where I serve as vice-chairman of the Transportation or Infrastructure Committee, has come out against the House bill as being “anti-city and town because it actually raises taxes on American families, diminishes local decision making over local taxes by eliminating SALT deductions and strips cities of tools like bonds that enable local leaders to build strong, healthy and economically vibrant communities.” See NLC.org/tax reform.
On top of all of this, if passed and enacted into law, this “tax reform” bill will raise the national debt by $1.5 trillion over the next ten years – in other words, the government will lose that much revenue – therefore, the government will have to borrow that much more to maintain today's level of services or reduce services by slashing Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and the like. Our children will pay the price and our country will be weakened all because corporations and the wealthy Republican donor class want more wealth. It is truly a historic example of unfettered greed.

Rap's reigning elder statesman, Snoop Dogg, seems to have the golden touch. Everything he does is straight magic, including his weekend appearance at the Bottlerock Napa Valley Music Festival in Calirfornia.
During Snoop's appearance at the festival, the "Gin & Juice" rapper was part of a record breaking feat. After his performance, Big Snoop helped break the world record for largest cocktail, with an astoundingly massive glass of gin and juice!
In my @djkhaled voice another 1 A post shared by snoopdogg (@snoopdogg) on May 27, 2018 at 11:10am PDT
The 1994 hit continues to be a pop culture landmark nearly 25 years later. The only real surprise is why it took so long for someone to get Snoop on board with making a record-breaking drink.
After receiving a few customer complaints regarding overheating of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon range, Lenovo has begun a voluntary recall of its fifth iteration of the laptop.
An internal investigation conducted by the company has revealed that some of its ThinkPad X1 Carbon notebooks manufactured between December 2016 and October 2017 have an “unfastened screw” that could be damaging the battery, leading to overheating and “potentially posing a fire hazard”.
The affected models – 20HQ, 20HR, 20K3, and 20K4 – were sold worldwide and Lenovo is advising owners to switch off their notebooks and not use them until a free service inspection, to be conducted by the manufacturer, can be undertaken.

A small fortune has been paid to Z-list celebrities for turning on Christmas lights across Britain.
Bosses at hard-up councils spent at least £171,000 on so-called stars.
Four-figure sums were given to reality TV contestants, soap actors, former pop stars and kids' TV characters.
Blackburn with Darwen Council paid X Factor 2014 winner Ben Haenow £6,500, pop duo Phats and Small £2,500 and CBeebies presenter Mr Bloom £2,500 – hiring all three acts as part of its £50,000 Christmas programme.
Renfrewshire Council paid £12,000 to book rock band Ash plus £4,000 for other musicians.

Singer-songwriter Ryan Lawrie, sixth in 2016's The X-Factor, was hired by both East Ayrshire Council and Hyndburn Borough Council.
It is not known how much he earned, but East Ayrshire spent £4,850 on performers while Hyndburn, in Lancs, shelled out £7,995 on Lawrie and Sam Lavery, another X Factor star, plus BGT's Ella Shaw.

St Helens Council paid £5,000 to boy band 5ive while Oldham Council splashed out the same sum on Finnish singer Saara Aalto – second in last year's X Factor.
Coronation Street actor Antony Cotton, who plays Sean Tully, was handed £2,400 by Chorley Council in Lancs while North West Leicestershire Council paid a Steps Tribute act £1,100 for its switch-on.

The Daily Mirror sent Freedom of Information requests to around 470 local authorities asking about the cost of their celebration events.
Some councils refused to answer, including Stockport Metropolitan Borough, which hired S Club Party, Celebrity Big Brother 's Amelia Lily and X Factor contestant Lucy Spraggan.

Perth & Kinross Council, which secured the services of popular bands including Boyzlife and East 17, also failed to disclose the total cost of its celebration to taxpayers.
Many other councils switched on their Christmas lights for free, by asking the Mayor to push the button followed by performances from local bands.

John O'Connell, of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: “Turning on the lights in town centres can be a great way of bringing people together to celebrate.
“However, at a time when councils are cutting back on other services, they can't justify giving vast amounts of taxpayers money to Z-list celebrities.
“If we are ever going to live within our means then wasteful spending like this must be cut out.”
E-Learning and Fisheries may be up for the next round of cuts stemming from phase two of the Strategic Pathways Initiative, UA President Johnsen's plan to restructure the universities.
Despite recent votes from both UAA and UAF faculty senate expressing no confidence in Johnsen's actions and decisions, the president says the process is continuing as planned.
Along with e-Learning and the fisheries department, smaller community campuses and the Health programs such as nursing and allied health will be examined, as well as administrative areas such as human resources, university relations, student services and institutional research. While the administrative areas of focus are human resources, university relations, student services and institutional research.
New areas of focus are not the only changes to be implemented in this new phase. While university input was gathered during Phase one, it arrived in the form of crowded public forums which often resulted in little productivity, Johnsen said.
Phase two will include a series of smaller, focused meetings with the faculty and staff of the affected areas of focus to inform them of potential changes and narrow down options. These will replace many of public forums held during phase one.
“It's going to take a lot more time,” Johnsen said. “But I think it's an improvement in the ability for affected people to have voice.”
By meeting with affected faculty and staff, Johnsen hopes to ease some of the resentment expressed during Phase I about a lack of communication between faculty and administration. This comes just days after the UAF faculty senate joined UAA in voting no confidence in Johnsen's decisions and actions regarding Strategic Pathways.
“When I review these options with the Board of Regents, I will be able to provide input from the faculty and staff that are directly affected and directly involved,” Johnsen said.
As part of this second phase, new areas of focus will be examined for quality, cost effectiveness, fiscal sustainability, student access and community impact, according to Johnsen.
The Board of Regents will be briefed on the gathered input from faculty and senate during their scheduled meeting in Anchorage, Mar. 2-3.
Beginning in April, a second series of meetings will be held to inform faculty of narrowed down choices and options for moving forward prior to the regents final decision in June, Johnsen said.
Teams have already been created to begin mapping out potential areas of focus and decisions to be made in Phase three. While some work will be done over the summer, much of the third phase will likely happen during Fall semester 2017, after faculty and students return to campus, according to Johnsen.
“We are proceeding,” Johnsen said. “The Board of Regents strongly supports the Strategic Pathways process and we're moving forward with it.”

A schoolfriend of Holmes Chapel student Nell Jones, who tragically died in the Manchester Arena attack, is taking part in a 50 mile challenge to raise money for the charity set up in her memory.
Molly Butler, 17, is taking part in Race At Your Own Pace.
Her mum, Sarah, said: “Molly had set herself the challenge to do. She's got to run 50 miles over May. She didn't have to do it for charity because it was a personal challenge, but she wanted to do it to raise money in memory of Nell.”
Nell was just 14 when she died in the horrific bombing which claimed the lives of 22 people and injured many more.
Sarah said: “Molly had known Nell for years. They weren't in the same class, Molly is in the sixth form so a couple of years older than Nell, but they went to dance school together when they were little.”
Molly is clocking up the miles on a treadmill in the gym because she has asthma and suffers from hayfever.
She is hoping people will back her efforts and help raise money for the Remembering Nell Foundation by donating on her Justgiving Page.
On the page Molly says: “Nell was a pupil at my school at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, so this foundation is very close to home.
“The Remembering Nell Foundation is a small charity constitution developed by family and friends of Nell Jones. The purpose of this charity is to improve the lives and well being of young people in the north west by raising funds to support registered charities for example, mental health, homelessness, disability, poverty or social and economic circumstances.”

Incredible footage has been released by NASA which shows the red planet could in fact be blue.
Video captured by the Curiosity spans miles across Mars and in parts the clip appears to show the planet with a blueish tinge.
And a panoramic view from the surface has also been created from images taken by the rover since it landed on Mars in 2012.
The Mars Curiosity landed in Gale Crater and one of its on-board cameras captured 16 separate images at points along its journey at the top of the Vera Rubin Ridge.

These were then put together to form the breathtaking picture.
And thanks to some clever visual effects - the usually red planet gets a blue hue - making the scene more familiar to us humans.
NASA adjusted the colour balance in the images so that the rocks appear as they would during daylight on Earth.

The photos taken in October last year looks over the crater which is between 3.5 and 3.8 billion years old.
It also spans an area of 30 miles.
The photos were taken just before northern Mars' winter solstice which means there were clear skies to capture the stunning views.
And because of the thin atmosphere on the planet it means mountains that are more than 50 miles away can be seen in the shots.

In a written statement, curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada said: "Even though Curiosity has been steadily climbing for five years, this is the first time we could look back and see the whole mission laid out below us.
"From our perch on Vera Rubin Ridge, the vast plains of the crater floor stretch out to the spectacular mountain range that forms the northern rim of Gale Crater."
The space agency also released an annotated version of the panorama photo to point out places from the mission such as "Yellowknife Bay" - an ancient freshwater-lake environment.
They are now preparing to use the robot's drill to analyse powdered rock samples.

DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) - The two biggest figures at the Memorial, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, managed to carve out some private time at the back of the 10th tee amid a mass of people Wednesday at Muirfield Village.
Some of it was just catching up. The two most prolific winners of major championship had not seen each other since April at the Masters.
And the tournament host had some encouraging words.
Nicklaus complimented Woods on his swing, and then told him what Woods has felt for the last few months.
"He was saying that my swing is starting to look a little bit better," Woods said. "And I said, 'Yeah, I'm really not that far away,' and he totally agreed. He just kept urging me to be patient with it because he could see that I've made some pretty big strides this year, and not far away from putting it all together."
The Memorial presents such an opportunity.
Woods has won at the course Jack built a record five times. The most recent victory was in 2012, when he took command from behind the 16th green by turning a potential bogey into a chip-in birdie that Nicklaus still thinks is one of the best shots he ever saw.
The most recent appearance? That's different.
Woods last played the Memorial in 2015. In the last few months before a series of back surgeries, Woods shot 85 in the third round, the worst score of his career. Because an uneven number of players made the cut, Woods teed off Sunday morning as a single and shot 74.
"I tried, and unfortunately on this golf course, hitting it as bad as I did, it just wasn't good enough," Woods said.
As for playing as a single? Woods smiled.
"I didn't want to have anyone watch me play the way I was playing," he said.
Rory McIlroy was standing at the side of the room as Woods spoke, listening to a player with 90 victories worldwide talking about the time he signed his name to an 85 on his scorecard. McIlroy recalled his highest round at 83 in the South African Open in 2007, his seventh tournament as a pro.
McIlroy climbed the steps to the stage as Woods was leaving and said to him, "Aside from your 85, you have won here five times."
Those are the memories Woods hopes to draw from when the Memorial begins Thursday on a Muirfield Village course in its usual mint condition. The tournament is two weeks before the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, and it has the kind of field that makes it feel like a mini-major.
Only two players from the top 10 in the world are missing: Jon Rahm and U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka.
Justin Rose is coming off a victory at Colonial, his ninth consecutive year with a victory somewhere in the world. Justin Thomas is making his debut at No. 1 in the world, an achievement that doesn't come with a trophy but one that meant enough to him that he stayed up later than usual when he got home after The Players Championship to see the world ranking page with his name at the top. He took a screen shot.
"Seeing every golfer in the world behind my name is a pretty fun thing," Thomas said.
Dustin Johnson, who doesn't appear to be concerned with much in life, conceded he was eager to get back the No. 1 ranking he held for 15 months. This is his first tournament since he lost the No. 1 spot to Thomas.
Nicklaus was around the first and 10th tee boxes during the pro-am to greet them all, a list that includes Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler.
Woods has made strides since his return from a fourth back surgery, including a runner-up finish at the Valspar Championship in March, and an exciting charge at Bay Hill that ended with a tee shot out of bounds on the 16th hole.
Nicklaus suggested on Tuesday that Woods has to learn anew how to win because it has been five years since his last victory.
McIlroy understood what he meant, having gone 18 months between victories until he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational. McIlroy started this year with good chances at Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and then he broke through at Bay Hill.
"As long as you put yourself in contention more and more and keep knocking on the door, sooner or later you're going to step through," McIlroy said. "And then with that, experience will do great things for you going forward."
Woods hasn't been within five shots of the lead going into Sunday since Bay Hill. He never got going at the Masters or at Quail Hollow, and while he had a season-best 65 in the third round at The Players Championship, he still was 11 shots out of the lead. The idea this week is to get in range.
"The last few times that I've had a chance, I've felt very comfortable," he said. "Hopefully I can just shoot the low round when I need it."

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was said to be full of "uncontrollable grief" after hearing about a bus crash which killed 32 tourists and four locals in his country.
After expressing his "bitter sorrow" the dictator visited some of the crash survivors as they lay in their hospital beds, even holding hands with some.
His actions have been met with cynicism by some in the west, saying Kim is attempting to show the world a softer side and act more like a conventional leader.
The crash report was an unusual feature on the tightly-controlled news channel which normally only features positive stories about its leader.
(Image: AFP)
The accident occurred on Sunday, when a bus crashed off a bridge in North Hwanghae Province.
Four North Koreans were killed in the accident and two people, also believed to be Chinese tourists, were left critically injured.
According to the official Korea Central News Agency Kim said "the unexpected accident brought bitter sorrow to his heart and that he couldn't control his grief at the thought of the bereaved families who lost their blood relative".
Chinese tourists make up about 80 percent of all foreign visitors to North Korea, according to a South Korean think-tank, the Korea Maritime Institute.
It estimates that tourism generates annual revenue of about £29million for the isolated country.
Kim Jong-un is expected to meet South Korean president Moon Jae-in on Friday, ahead of a planned summit with US president Donald Trump in late May or early June.

Cannabinoid Drugs are natural occurring recreational drugs that are used to treat chronic pain, anorexia, and nausea & vomiting. The cannabinoid is used for a group of drugs that are structurally related to tetrahydrocannabinoids. It is synthetically manufactured by pharma companies to treat different type of indications, such as multiple sclerosis, migraine, arthritis, seizures, etc. Cannabinoid drugs are naturally isolated from cannabis and work on the endocannabinoid system of mammals. Other applications include their use as an anti-inflammatory agent as they modulate the cytokine cascade and psychoactive effect. Its psychoactive effect has been found to be moderately effective in treating traumatic brain injuries, neuropathic pain, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Clinically, three cannabinoid drugs are approved for treatment. The first cannabinoid drug is nabilone, which is a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist and is used for relieving nausea & vomiting. It is a synthetic analog of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Other drugs, such as dronabinol and Sativex, are used for treating AIDS-related anorexia and neuropathic pain in advanced cancer & multiple sclerosis patients, respectively. Anandamide, 2-Arachidonoylglycerol, Cannabigerol, Cannabichromene, Cannabinol, Cannabidiol, Tetrahydrocannabinol are clinically important cannabinoids used for medical treatment.

Cannabinoid Drugs Market: Drivers and Restraints
Rising demand for cannabinoid drugs for treating chronic pain in different indications is expected to fuel the growth of the market. Presently, a limited number of cannabinoid drugs are approved for human use and this will create new opportunities for manufacturers who are involved in the development of cannabinoid drugs. Along with these, commercial use of cannabinoid drugs is increasing constantly due to changing government regulations. For example, cannabinoid drugs usage has been legalized in ten states of the U.S. and the federation of Australian government has formulated a new Narcotic Drug Amendment Bill 2016 to permit cultivation of cannabis for medical usage and research. The rapid advancement of technologies has led to substantial progress in developing cannabinoid drugs. For example, many recent studies have spoken in favor of cannabinoid drugs usage for the treatment of Alzheimers and cancer. All these factors will act as potential drivers, thereby boosting the burgeoning growth of the cannabinoid drugs market.
Huge investments are being made for the development of cannabinoid drugs. However, this investment have only been able to fuel slow growth into the cannabinoid drugs market. Along with this, stringent regulations regarding the usage of cannabinoids will also restrain the cannabinoid drugs market.

Suspect In New York Subway Blast Had 'Low-Tech' Device
Police are calling an explosion in a crowded corridor between two New York City subway stations Monday morning an attempted terror attack. Officials say suspect Akayed Ullah detonated an improvised pipe bomb that was strapped to his body.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:
We are learning more about the man who's suspected of setting off an explosion in a crowded corridor between two New York City subway stations this morning. Police are calling it an attempted terror attack. They say a suspect named Akayed Ullah is in custody. NPR's Joel Rose reports from New York.
JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Surveillance video footage shows a crowded underground corridor near Times Square at rush hour. There's a sudden flash of white smoke, and when it clears a single figure is lying on the ground.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
BILL DE BLASIO: This was an attempted terrorist attack. Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve his ultimate goals.
ROSE: That's Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference this morning.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
DE BLASIO: As New Yorkers, our lives revolve around the subways. When we hear of an attack on the subway it's incredibly unsettling. Thank God the only injuries we know at this point were minor.
ROSE: Three bystanders were treated for ringing in the ears and headaches, according to the fire department, while the suspect sustained burns to his hands and abdomen. He's in custody at Bellevue Hospital. NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller says the suspect had a low-tech explosive device strapped to his body.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN MILLER: The device is based on a pipe bomb. It was affixed to his person with a combination of Velcro and zip ties. We're going to gather up those pieces and we'll have a better idea of what the device was put together with and what was inside it.
ROSE: Police identified the suspect as Akayed Ullah. He's 27 years old and lives in Brooklyn. Local and federal law enforcement officials fanned out across the borough, trying to learn more about him from family and neighbors. Immigration officials say he's a lawful permanent resident who came to the U.S. from Bangladesh in 2011 with his family. At the White House today, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the attack underscores the need for tougher immigration policies.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: We must protect our borders. We must ensure that individuals entering our country are not coming to do harm to our people. And we must move to a merit-based system of immigration.
ROSE: The Trump administration has pushed for an end to so-called chain migration based on family relationships. Sanders did not elaborate on her suggestion that Ullah was radicalized outside of the U.S. Police in New York haven't said much about what might have motivated the suspect. Mike O'Neil is a former commanding officer of the NYPD's counterterrorism division.
MICHAEL O'NEIL: To me, it looks like a homegrown - I hate using that term, but a - someone that was radicalized either locally or online by ISIS.
ROSE: O'Neil is now the CEO of MSA security in New York. Based on the surveillance camera footage, O'Neil says the bomb was not well-made.
O'NEIL: It was a low-order explosive. It probably wasn't prepared well. And it probably didn't detonate like he assumed it would detonate.
ROSE: O'Neil says the suspect did choose a prime target, just a few hundred feet from the Port Authority, one of the busiest bus terminals anywhere. If the bomb had worked as intended, O'Neil says, the damage would have been much, much worse. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York.

There's one big question looming when The Fosters returns for its fifth season later this summer: Will Callie (Maia Mitchell) be able to escape Diamond's (Hope Olaide Wilson) pimp before she has to do something she can never take back?
At the end of last season, Callie offered herself to go with Diamond so she wouldn't get beat up by her pimp. The idea was that Stef (Teri Polo) would track Callie's phone and find both girls before anything got too serious -- but Callie's phone ended up in a drug bag and went halfway to L.A. as Stef followed behind.

That means Callie was stranded in a seedy hotel with a pimp and no way to escape. TVGuide.com has obtained exclusive first look photos of Callie and Diamond in the season premiere. The good news is the girls look relatively unscathed -- and might be able to escape! Check out the images below.

FESTUS, Mo. – A 17-year-old Festus boy's life was cut short Saturday night when he was accidentally shot in front of his house on Iditarod Trail by a friend.
“These boys evidently found a gun in one of the local parks, played with it, pointed it at each other, then the gun accidentally went off,” said Chief Tim Lewis, Festus Police Department.
The bullet struck Zackary Depung in the upper back near his neck. He was flown to St. Louis and endured hours of surgery. He succumbed to his injuries early Sunday morning.
“Right now, it's an open investigation. We're going to try and get all the evidence we can,” Lewis said.
Chief Lewis wouldn't say which park the boys allegedly found the gun in because if one was really found there, he doesn't want to hurt the investigation.
“I'm sure the 17-year-old's fingerprints will be on gun. If they took the magazine in and out, the prints will be on there and we'll focus on what ammunition we have left and see where it takes us,” he said.
Depung's two sisters and girlfriend, who asked not to be on camera, described Zackary as a young man full of life and love. The three of them believe this was a tragic accident.
“The last thing I want to do is follow leads that don't lead anywhere. We're not doing this on speculation or social media, just the facts of the case,” Lewis said.
Depung left Festus High School in January 2017 to be homeschooled, but had lots of friends throughout the district.
Chief Lewis said it won't be difficult to trace the gun through the ATF, but problems can arise if the gun was stolen or lost.
Festus police said the case remains under investigation. Once the gun trace is complete, they will know more on how to go about wrapping up their investigation. But if the gun was found in the park, it raises more serious questions for police to deal with.

TripAdvisor can make or break a new business.
In the early stages of any new restaurant or visitor attraction's life, favourable reviews on the popular customer feedback website can help it prosper while a smattering of negative reviews can put other people off going, spelling trouble for its future.
And considering a few teething problems are usually expected as a business finds its feet, it's not uncommon to see a few disgruntled customers sharing their unsavoury views on the internet.
So when a new attraction receives nothing but five-star ratings from every single person who has chosen to review it, it's fairly remarkable.

And that's exactly what VR Star has managed to do.
The immersive, cutting edge virtual reality gaming centre which opened in Cabot Circus in December has been reviewed by 33 people so far, all of whom have rated it ‘Excellent' with no exception.
Complete with two realistic TRON bikes, two Gatling guns, two racing cars and much more, all fitted with high-end VR technology, it was billed to be every gamer's absolute paradise and that's exactly what it has proved to be so far.
Visitors in particular heap praise onto the centre's incredible graphics, helpful staff and unique experience, with several reviewers saying they booked another session immediately after their first as they loved it so much.
Bristol's VR Star is the company's flagship arena with the team behind it planning to open up more around the world over the coming months, and they'll no doubt be very encouraged by this glowing praise.
Not only that but they are already in the process of improving it, as if it wasn't good enough already, working on 360-degree real life movies and CGI interactive content which will give brave visitors the chance to feed dinosaurs, battle with zombies, fend off sharks and more.
Arek Antoniak, Operations Manager, VR Star, said: “We are thrilled to have received such fantastic feedback from VR Star customers.
“We opened the centre to bring families and friends together, and our amazing Immotion virtual reality platforms allow us to do this, engaging all senses so that groups can interact together in a truly immersive world.”
VR Star is located next to Starbucks in Cabot Circus and its opening times are Monday - Friday, 12pm - 10pm, Saturday 10am - 10pm and Sunday 11am - 8pm.

The matter was mentioned before a Supreme Court bench led by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, which listed it for hearing on 22 March. Photo: Mint
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear Reliance Communications Ltd's plea seeking a stay on orders of the Bombay high court and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) -Mumbai bench, barring the Anil Ambani-controlled company from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd without prior approval.
The matter was mentioned before a bench led by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, which listed the matter for hearing on 22 March.
Earlier this month, the Bombay high court rejected RCom's appeal against an order of an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission. The order prohibiting transfer of assets was passed in a proceeding initiated by Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson for recovery of Rs1,012 crore of arrears from RCom.
Separately, in a plea by HSBC Daisy Investments which had invested Rs1,100 crore in July 2007 in Reliance InfraTel, NCLT also directed RCom unit Reliance Infratel not to sell its towers and fibre assets to Reliance Jio till further order.
HSBC Daisy Investments along with some minority shareholders in Reliance InfraTel had approached NCLT alleging oppression of minority shareholders for not taking their consent for the asset sale.
In December 2017, as a part of its debt resolution plan, RCom had struck a Rs25,000 crore deal with Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets to avoid proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
RCom's debt at the end of October 2017 stood at Rs45,000 crore
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint's publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case.

Paul Clement is set to be named as Swansea manager, after Bayern Munich confirmed he has been given permission to speak to the Welsh club.
The Swans made Carlo Ancelotti's assistant their No.1 choice to replace Bob Bradley, after parting company with the American following the 4-1 loss to West Ham on Boxing Day.
Now Clement is set to put pen-to-paper on a deal at the Liberty Stadium until 2019, with the Swans hierarchy hoping to finalise his deal on Monday night, before handing him a £30million transfer budget to guide them to safety.
Owners Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan have signalled they are willing to invest in the team, with relegation staring them in the face.
(Photo: Dean Mouhtaropoulos)
Clement only moved to Bavaria in the summer, reuniting with Ancelotti at Bayern after the pair had previously worked together at Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid - where they won the 2014 Champions League.
However his desire to be a No.1 was always likely to come to the fore sooner rather than later, with the 44-year-old keen to set the record straight after a short spell at Derby in 2015-16.
The Rams parted company with Clement after just eight months - despite sitting fifth in the Championship table at the time, and only five points off the automatic promotion places.
(Photo: 2016 Getty Images)
The Swans currently sit 19th in the Premier League, after a 3-0 mauling by Bournemouth at the weekend, and have already shipped 44 goals in 19 games.
Swansea's Neil Taylor said last week that they would be behind Clement, should he be handed the task of keeping them in the Premier League.
"Paul Clement has got great credentials as a coach and he comes highly regarded by a few people that have played with him.
"Who will get the job, I don't know. If it is Clement then all the boys will take to him and work as hard as they can and hopefully they can help to turn it around."

A Bristol city centre tower block with cladding akin to that of Grenfell Tower will have it replaced amid fears of a similar tragedy.
It was revealed in August that 14-storey Eclipse Tower, above Harvey Nichols in Penn Street, had similar cladding to the west London tower block where at least 71 people died in a fire on June 14, 2017.
The privately-owned apartment block is covered in an aluminium composite material (ACM). It also has a polyethylene (PE) core – the same combination of materials used at Grenfell Tower.
The materials are believed to have played a major part in the rapid spread of the fire in the summer blaze, which started after a fridge-freezer malfunctioned on the fourth floor.
Upon the discovery at the Eclipse Tower, residents were sent a letter by the owners of the building, Bristol Alliance, asking them to make sure all electrical appliances were switched off at night.
Developer Hammerson has now revealed the cladding will be replaced “as early as summer 2018” following advice from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) – but residents face an anxious wait until then.
A spokesperson for Hammerson, on behalf of the landlords, said: “Following extensive testing of the Eclipse Tower cladding in line with DCLG's advice and guidance, residents have been notified of the landlords' decision to replace the cladding.
“The programme of works could commence as early as summer 2018, however this is subject to securing the necessary statutory consents and the relevant Building Control approvals.”

Bristol Alliance has previously said the building is considered “low risk”, although residents have also been asked to have their wiring regularly checked and avoid having barbecues on the balconies.
Patrols of the building have been carried out and dedicated fire-watch CCTV cameras were installed as additional fire risk measures.
The Hammerson spokesperson added: “Throughout this process, the safety of residents has been our number one priority.
“We have been working with the relevant authorities, including Avon Fire and Rescue Service, who have inspected the common parts of the building on a number of occasions and confirmed that fire safety provision is compliant under the Regulatory Reform “Fire Safety” Order.”
The luxury apartment block was the second building in Bristol to be found to have similar cladding to Grenfell Tower. Waverley House student halls in Queen Charlotte Street had part of its cladding removed in July because it failed government tests.

She has a big voice and a big personality. X Factor fans fell in love with Amelia Lily, who finished third on the show in 2011.
Following the appearance of Frankie Cocozza, her ex, on Celebrity Big Brother a few years ago, Amelia is now living in the 2017 edition of the house.
After X Factor, the 22-year-old's career seems to have taken off. She's recorded some hit singles, landed a major deal with Sony and performed in West End shows.
But who is Amelia? Here is everything you need to know about her...
(Image: Rex)
Who is Amelia Lily and where is she from?
Amelia Lily Oliver was born on 16 October 1994 in Middlesborough to Aranka Bradley and Barry Oliver. She was educated at the independent, fee-paying Teeside High School.
Amelia was a figure skater for six years during her childhood, but her real passion has always been music: She's been writing songs with her guitar since she was 13 and regularly posted videos of herself singing on YouTube during secondary school. One video in which she covers Adele's Someone Like You was viewed more than one million times.
Her love for singing, however, meant she was picked on. “I didn't have a lot of mates at school and was bullied a lot for wanting to sing," she told the Daily Star in 2013.
“When I got into the X Factor they all started contacting me out of the blue but I ignored it all. I'm very grateful to the few good friends and close family that I do have in my life.”
Amelia is dating Steve Rushton - who previously dated Miley Cyrus.
Steve dated singer Miley back in 2009 before her twerking days when she was 16 and (probs a bit more innocent), when he appeared on the Hannah Montana: The Movie.
Why is Amelia Lily famous?
Amelia first came to fame with her appearance on X Factor, where she finished third in 2011.
She progressed to the Live Show stage where she was at first unsuccessful. However, when former boyfriend Frankie Cocozza was ejected from the show following many broken rules Lily was reinstated as his replacement.

She progressed onto the next live show, made it to the final where she performed with her mentor Kelly Rowland and eventually lost out to Little Mix and Marcus Collins.

Following the show Lily was signed by Sony with a £500,000 record deal, and soon released You Bring Me Joy, which peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and number 21 in the Republic of Ireland.
In 2015, Amelia was in the West End production of Green Day musical, American Idiot playing Whatsername, the only lead female in the show.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Moscow has deployed a cruise missile in an apparent treaty violation, a senior military official told CNN Tuesday.
The move is just the latest in a string of Russian provocations in the early days of the Trump administration, which has called for warmer relations with the Kremlin.
The traditional US adversary has also positioned a spy ship off the coast of Delaware and carried out flights near a US Navy warship, concerning American officials. The administration has not officially drawn any links between the three events.
The ground-launched cruise missile seems to run counter to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the senior military official said. The New York Times first reported is deployment.
While declining to speak on intelligence matters, a spokesman for the US State Department did draw attention to Russian violations of the treaty.
"The Russian Federation remains in violation of its INF Treaty obligations not to possess, produce or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles," acting spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement issued Tuesday.
Russia is believed to have tested one such missile in 2014.
"We have made very clear our concerns about Russia's violation, the risks it poses to European and Asian security, and our strong interest in returning Russia to compliance with the treaty," Toner added.
Just last week, a US navy warship in the Black Sea had three encounters with Russian aircraft Friday that were deemed to be unsafe and unprofessional because of how close the Russian planes flew to the US, according to a senior defense official.
The USS Porter, a destroyer, was operating in the Black Sea when it was approached three times by Russian aircraft, including one IL-38 and two SU-24s. The Navy calculated the Russian planes may have flown as close as 1,000 yards laterally from the ship and 1,000 feet over the water, but did not cross the deck of the Porter.
Meanwhile, a US defense official told CNN that the Russian spy ship, the SSV-175 Viktor Leonov, is sailing in international waters off the coast of Delaware. The vessel is outfitted with a variety of high-tech spying equipment and is designed to intercept signals intelligence. Fox News first reported on the ship's location.
The official noted that this is not the first time the ship has been deployed off the coast of the US. Similar patrols were carried out by the Leonov in 2014 off the coast of Florida and in 2015, adding that such missions were much more common during the Cold War.
The Russian cruise missile would be capable of threatening NATO's European members. Secretary of Defense James Mattis is due to visit NATO's headquarters to meet with his counterparts Wednesday.
"The INF Treaty eliminated an entire category of weapons that threatened Europe, in particular the threat of short-warning attacks. The treaty remains a key component of our security, and any Russian non-compliance is a serious concern for the alliance," a NATO official told CNN.
"NATO allies have the capabilities in place to ensure that Russia will not gain any military advantage from disregarding the INF Treaty," the official added.
The Kremlin's moves come the day after Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after failing to fully disclose conversations he had with Russia's ambassador to the US concerning US sanctions while he was not yet in office.
Trump has in the past expressed interest in arms reduction talks with the Kremlin and indicated he would seek a new opening with Moscow.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer, however, said Tuesday that the administration's stance on Moscow, saying, "The president has been incredibly tough on Russia."
Spicer pointed to UN Ambassador Nikki Haley's recent remarks on the Russia's actions in east Ukraine and occupation of Crimea, adding that Trump "expects the Russian government to deescalate violence in Ukraine and return Crimea."
"At the same time he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with Russia unlike previous administrations," he added.
Asked about sanctions against Russia, newly minted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that sanctions were an important tool but would not specify any intensions towards Russia.
"Our current sanctions programs are in place, and I would say sanctions are an important tool that we will continue to look at for various different countries. But it's a very important program within the Treasury Department," Mnuchin said.
In contrast, Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, called for a strong response to the cruise missile.
"If the last administration showed us anything, it's that ignoring these kinds of provocations simply means they will proliferate," he said in a statement. "I've said before we need to set firm boundaries for Russia's behavior -- and enforce them to the hilt. I take this news as evidence that the US should build up its nuclear forces in Europe."

The ruffled off-the-shoulder frock is still among the hottest silhouettes of the summer, and Zendaya found a way to turn the warm-weather style into a red carpet–worthy win. The Spider-Man: Homecoming star stepped out for a photocall in Madrid, Spain, in a light blue Jonathan Simkhai dress that we'd love to wear to our next summer wedding.
The frock featured a cascading ruffled neckline that flowed down her side and was almost strapless, save for two skinny straps holding it up. The pretty periwinkle gown (shop a similar style here) also featured a tasteful cutout at her right rib and a thigh-high slit that showed off her toned legs. Zendaya paired the dress with blue sequined pumps from Rihanna's collaboration with Manolo Blahnik ($1,295; manoloblahnik.com), a wavy hairstyle, and hoop earrings. If you love her look, check out another similar, winning style here.
Her Spider-Man co-star, Tom Holland, went more casual for the event, rocking a blue blazer, white tee, low-rise jeans, and Nike sneakers.
As for the film, while Zendaya stars alongside Holland, she won't be playing his love interest, Mary Jane Watson. The actress will be playing a character named Michelle, who we know little about.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are spending those precious first few days with their new son.
It's an extremely special time for any new parents, and it's no different if you're royal and the baby happens to be fifth in line to the throne.
And just like all mums and dads Kate and Wills, who welcomed a baby boy weighing 8oz 7lb on Monday , are allowed to take some time off work.
Obviously work is a bit different from them, and they're not taking a break from eight hours sitting in the office, but work is still work.
(Image: Daily Mirror)
Back in 2013 when Prince George was born, Wills was working as a Sea King helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in Anglesey.
Like every other new father, he took the Government's Ordinary Paternity Leave scheme, which meant he was entitled to two weeks at home and £273.56.
He did the same in 2015 with Princess Charlotte, when he was working as an air ambulance helicopter pilot.
After her birth the family only spent a few days in London before heading back to their Norfolk home, where they remained the for the rest of his fortnight break.
(Image: AFP)
But things will be a bit different this time around, as Prince William quit his job last year to become a full time royal.
It won't technically be paternity leave, but Kensington Palace has said he will be spending time focusing on his family.
This is expected to be around two weeks, which is what most other new dads get.
(Image: Daily Mirror)
Kate started her maternity leave at the end of March, and her final event was a visit to London's Olympic Park in Stratford, east London.
We saw her again a few days later when the royal family went to church on Easter Sunday , but it wasn't an official event so doesn't count as work.
She was back to work very soon after her last two births.
She attended her first official event just six weeks after welcoming Princess Charlotte.
(Image: DAILY MIRROR)
The palace has said Kate will be "focusing on her family" for longer than her husband, and she's likely to be off for most of the summer and into the autumn.
But it's obviously quite a busy time for the royal family and there are lots of exciting events in the diary they can't miss so we expect to see her very soon.
We should see both Kate and Wills again in just a few weeks time for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding at Windsor Castle .
There will also be Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank in October to look forward to.

Business Secretary Greg Clark has waved through the sale of one Britain's oldest engineering firms to a controversial investment group.
Mr Clark dismissed claims of a "predatory" takeover as he confirmed the sale of GKN to Melrose Industries in the House of Commons.
The embattled engineering business, which employs 1,600 people at its aerospace division in Filton and 300 in Avonmouth, dates back to the 1900s and was instrumental in wartime manufacturing.
Labour had called for the sale of GKN to be blocked on national security grounds, as the company provides many Ministry of Defence contracts, but this was rejected.
Filton employees are "seriously concerned" about their jobs.
The aerospace sector provides more than 15,000 jobs in the South West, making the region the country's largest sector employer.
Dale Howarth, an employee at the site and a Unite union representative, said: “I'm worried about what impact it will have for all employees."
Mr Clark told MPs of the numerous assurances given by Melrose as part of the £8.1 billion takeover deal.
(Image: Jerome Ellerby)
He said: "The MoD has completed its detailed analysis and has agreed with Melrose a series of undertakings specifically to ensure that the Government is informed in advance of any plans to divest a business, a component of the business or assets which engage in activities that the Ministry of Defence considers to have national security implications."
Mr Clark said the Government had been given "suitable protections" from any subsequent sale of the business and had been given assurances over the continuation of contractual obligations "to protect intellectual property and classified information".
Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told ministers the assurances were "not sufficient to guarantee security of the long-term prospects" of the company or the workforce.
She said: "Melrose are reportedly short-termist in their outlook which undermines the long-term thinking required in defence projects.
"What we needed today from the secretary was not just a waving through of the deal, we needed action both in terms of obtaining concrete assurances from Melrose on the future of GKN and its workforce, but also clear plans to reform and widen our takeover regime to protect British businesses.
"I fear the short-term predators already smell their next victim and it's not just Melrose, it's Britain's industrial future."
Mr Clark hit back telling Ms Long-Bailey she had "prejudiced her position" by advancing the takeover should be blocked from the outset and had "given away the ability to have influence".
The Business Secretary added: "This is the responsible way to proceed and she would do the employees and stakeholders of GKN a service if she would engage more forensically in future."
Bristol's metro mayor Tim Bowles and the city's mayor Marvin Rees have urged the government to protect jobs.
A letter sent to Mr Clark in February, which was also signed by other members of the West of England Joint Committee, said: “GKN acts as an anchor for high productivity sectors in Bristol, supporting innovation and new business investment… The potential takeover could have serious consequences... There could be a loss of high-skilled well-paid jobs, which help support our regional economy."
Melrose won its takeover battle to buy GKN in March after securing the backing of the engineering giant's shareholders.
A total of 52.43 per cent investor votes were cast in favour of the deal, just above the 50 per cent plus one share threshold.
Its victory brought to a close a bitter battle that has raged since January, with unions and MPs warning of job cuts and asset stripping.
China's 'Toilet Revolution' Is Flush With Lavish Loos
Enlarge this image toggle caption AFP/Getty Images AFP/Getty Images
Filthy, stinky, scarce and hard to find. Toilet paper, soap, hot water and hand dryers are too much to ask. Consider yourself lucky if the person before you aimed correctly and remembered to flush. That's what many Chinese public bathrooms are like.
According to the authorities, some 4.3 billion domestic and overseas visitors are subjected to these embarrassing conditions at China's tourist spots each year. So in April 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a "toilet revolution" — an all-out war on unhygienic bathroom conditions at tourist attractions.
Three years later, China has spent 21 billion yuan ($3 billion) building or renovating 68,000 public bathrooms at tourist sites in major cities and in rural areas. Authorities are improving quantity, distribution and management, as well as making facilities more environmentally friendly and attempting to clean up users' behavior.
While most cities simply aspire to make bathrooms cleaner and more available, others went overboard on lavish loos.
Potty pioneer Linfen has been building strange and fancy restrooms since 2008. The coal-mining hub has 40 five-star public toilets (see more here), 12 four-star toilets and 60 standard bathrooms. Facilities resemble castles, libraries, homes, even human faces. (The star designations are assigned by China's National Tourism Bureau.)
The city, which the government named an "Excellent City in Toilet Revolution" in 2017, plans to add Wi-Fi, ATMs, newsstands and electric-vehicle charging stations to its public bathrooms.
The city of Chongqing built three luxury bathrooms in a park. Each sports central air conditioning, sound systems and high-end construction — marble walls, wood paneling, handsome tile floors.
Elsewhere in this southwestern city, weird-looking bathrooms made headlines. At one open-air facility, the urinals have doors for privacy — but they only conceal, shall we say, one's business end. Other al fresco locations offer no coverage, so users must employ umbrellas or other DIY means of preserving modesty.
Efforts to improve manners are going as over the top as the architecture. In Beijing and Nanjing, the solution to toilet paper theft and waste is facial recognition: specifically, devices that scan your face before dispensing about two feet of TP. Patrons who need more must wait nine minutes for a second scan.
While some netizens applaud the use of such technology, many think it's unnecessary and inconvenient. As one person posted on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, "Why is facial recognition everywhere? Do you need to know what I look like when I just simply want to go to the bathroom?" "I'll just bring toilet paper with me," another fumed.
Backlash is coming from the government as well. In December, Chinese authorities warned local governments to stop wasting money on extravagant toilet facilities and just stick to making them practical, clean and efficient. This month, they were also asked to appoint "toilet chiefs" to keep an eye on sanitation in public bathrooms.
There's still a huge gap between public bathrooms in major cities and those in remote villages. In the fancy malls of Shanghai, citizens can relax and play with their phones in nicely scented, lounge-like restrooms with jazz playing in the background, while folks in rural areas may still use public or private open-pit squats surrounded by low brick walls and take care of business right beside pig pens.
"Toilet problems are not trivial, but something significant in construction of urban and rural civilization," Xi opined in November. He now wants to extend the toilet revolution beyond tourist sites. In the next three years, China aims to build and upgrade 64,000 more public restrooms with the aim of improving quality of life.
So far, there have been no leaks about the details of this new round of privy progress.
Working for Chef, which stars Saif Ali Khan and released in theatres on Friday, was a different kind of challenge for food stylist and consultant Sandhya S. Kumar. Until then, she had worked in commercials, where she only had to worry about making the food look good—chicken roast would be glazed with a coating of shoe polish and soya sauce, and puris stuffed with tissue paper to make them look fluffy. In the film, however, she also had to make it taste good.
Take, for instance, the “rotzza”—a pizza made out of two rotis, with meat and mozzarella cheese stuffing. It's the dish Roshan Kalra (played by Khan), a Michelin-star chef, rustles up for his son Armaan on his return from New York. The food soothes Armaan and reduces his animosity towards Roshan, who has a strained relationship with his wife and son.
For the scene to work, it was important that the food worked. Cooking from a back-end makeshift kitchen, away from the scene of action, Kumar remembers making at least 50 rotzzas. Only one of them, which was browned just right and had the right kind of stringiness in the cheese, was used.
Other food items featured in Chef, a remake of Jon Favreau's Hollywood film of the same name, are Kerala fish curry, Goan rawa fried fish and chhole bhature.
“It helps if the food is delicious,” says Khan, referring to the act of eating on screen.
Khan (or Chef Ali Khan, joked Twitter, the day the trailer was launched) says that a lot of the cooking he has done in the film is for real. He trained under two chefs from the JW Marriott in Juhu, Mumbai. Ranjit Thomas, executive sous chef, says they instructed Khan on everything, from making fresh pasta to getting the chef lingo right.

From the sookhi roti that was out of the reach of the poor in Mehboob Khan's Roti (1942) to the cheese-burst rotzza served from a food truck in Chef, food in Indian films has come a long way. There have been glorious moments in old films, such as the grand feast which appears out of thin air for the wandering musician duo in Satyajit Ray's fantasy classic Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969). But they have been few and far between. We are seeing a lot more focus on food on the big screen today, and not only because of the rise of a subgenre of food films in the recent past. Contemporary films that don't necessarily centre on food take it as seriously as they do their costumes and sets, using it as rich details of everyday life. The showcasing of food on celluloid, as one of life's basic needs as well as sensuous pleasures, by film-makers of different styles and cultures, has resulted in new and varied cinematic experiences.

The most popular trope is that of food as a familial glue. It goes back to Bawarchi (1972), a remake of the Bengali film Golpo Holeo Sotti (1966). Some of the more recent ones involve the foreign-returned hero. In Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana (2012), the key to Omi (Kunal Kapoor) running away from a gang of criminals in London and turning a new leaf is in rediscovering the secret recipe of a chicken dish that can revive the fortunes of their fledgling family dhaba business in Punjab. With his grandfather, the only person who knows the recipe, turning senile, it could be lost forever (it's another thing that the secret ingredient turns out to be marijuana). In the Malayalam film Ustad Hotel (2012), Feyzee (Dulquer Salmaan), trained in hotel management in Switzerland, defies his conservative Dubai-based businessman father to return to his grandfather's modest restaurant in Kozhikode. There, by helping his grandfather cook the famous Kozhikode chicken biryani and sipping Sulaimani black tea on its beaches on moonlit nights, he finds himself. And in the Bengali film Maachher Jhol, which released in August, celebrity chef Dev D., who returns from Paris to attend to his ailing mother, struggles to make a simple fish curry, his mother's dying wish.
“Food is constantly attached to memories, and, usually, good memories,” says Pratim D. Gupta, director of Maachher Jhol. “You remember your dead grandmother for the payesh she used to make on your birthday and the classmate who is no longer a friend, for the tiffin he used to share with you during the lunch break.”

The essence of home
Using food to portray the idea of home is universal. In Big Night (1996), for instance, two Italian brothers cook and fight but stick to each other till the end, as they struggle to keep afloat their restaurant business serving authentic Italian fare in New York. The Oscar-winning Babette's Feast (1987) is the story of two sisters who try to keep their father's spirit alive by living a life of frugality in a 19th century religious community in Denmark. A grand sensual feast at the end, featuring exquisite dishes such as quails in puff pastry and turtle soup, brings home the point that fine cooking can lead to spiritual experiences. In the Japanese film Tampopo (1985), the title character, a widow and single mother, takes charge of her husband's noodle shop. She is a mediocre cook who learns the art of making soulful noodles from two truck drivers who take a liking to her. Chinese director Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) is the story of an elderly chef who has lost his appetite—for food, for life; he lives in Taipei with his three daughters, who will soon be leaving home to start their own lives.

Food, in fact, tends to play an important role in many Asian films even if they are not about food. For instance, in Wong Kar-Wai's In The Mood For Love (2000), the bland white noodles can be seen as a metaphor for the joyless lives of the protagonists—Mrs Chan's walk down the alley to buy noodles from the stall, filmed with sad elegance, has become one of the most stunning, and celebrated, sequences in cinema.
Food finds a similar purpose in Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox (2013), where it begins reflecting the relationship between two lonely people who have never met but fall in love after tiffin dabbas get mixed up. The rich, creamy and spicy vegetarian food Ila (Nimrat Kaur) packs for her husband in the initial stages is designed to impress. But as she starts cooking for Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan) and gets to know his tastes better, through written notes sent along with the lunch boxes, it gets decidedly simpler, homier. “Since the characters never see each other, the only tactile relationship they have is through food,” says Batra on the phone from the US. “It becomes an important way to awaken each other's senses.”

Nice and real
Good-looking food isn't necessarily appetizing. In Mythologies, his seminal 1957 book of essays on pop culture and semiotics, French philosopher Roland Barthes is disparaging of the “petit bourgeoisie” in the chapter “Ornamental Cookery”. “…Cooking”—he writes about the excessive ornamentation of food pictures in Elle magazine, “according to Elle is meant for the eye alone, since sight is a genteel sense…a cookery which is based on coatings and alibis, and is forever trying to extenuate and even disguise the primary nature of foodstuffs, the brutality of meat or the abruptness of sea-food.”
This year's Malayalam sleeper hit Angamaly Diaries, which stars pork and has cameos from rabbit and python meat and a variety of fish, might have been more to Barthes' taste. The meat-eating culture of Angamaly, a small town in Kerala, in which gangs of bearded, swaggering men clad in mundus and checked shirts wage war in toddy shops over a plate of rabbit meat, almost becomes a metaphor for man's primal instinct for hunting, as the director indicates. “We didn't want to glamorize the food at any point,” says the director Lijo Jose Pellissery, who grew up close to Angamaly. “We shot it in the way it looked, nice and real. The film was dealing with a place known for its pork culture and experimentations with food, and one of the best ways to establish it was by its food habits.”
Although a vastly different film from Angamaly, Aditya Vikram Sengupta's arthouse indie, Asha Jaoar Majhe, possesses a similar anti-food-porn aesthetic. A lyrical portrait of a Bengali working-class couple, it takes the viewer through the life cycle of a fish curry. From the last moments of the fish, before it is picked up by the vendor to be cut and sold, to it being eaten, and scraps being fed to the stray cat: It could well be the longest food sequence in Indian cinema. The cooking is shown later. The man (Ritwick Chakraborty) does the fish shopping, the wife (Basabdutta Chatterjee) cooks. Every day they meet for a few minutes in the early hours of the dawn.
The cooking sequence, especially when watched on the big screen, is a thing to marvel at: droplets of water in the saucepan sizzle and evaporate over the stove, the golden mustard oil is poured in, the fish is fried and the vegetables are put in. If food can lose two of its primary elements—taste and smell—in cinema, Sengupta's wordless black and white film evokes these by making optimum use of sound and image. “It has a lot of childhood memories,” says Sengupta. “There are certain smells that make you recall certain situations, and similarly, certain situations and environments, which in this case meant deciding up to what degree the kitchen wall should look oily (to) help you imagine a smell.” It helped that the fish curry, light and robust, the kind of comfort food you crave when sick, was cooked by his mother.

Global Fusion
Indian cinema's romance with food is a more recent phenomenon compared to American and European films. Today, we've come a long way to being a MasterChef-watching, Foodstagram-savvy culture, where it's difficult to get a seat in a Japanese restaurant on a Saturday evening. The average Indian is more interested, and informed, about food than ever before. “My chef and restaurant-owner friends say they've never been approached by so many people coming up to them to tell that a certain sauce needed to be reduced a bit,” says Chef director Raja Menon. In a scene in Maachher Jhol, the chef faces a similar situation. Gupta agrees, adding that one of the things that drove him to make the film is that “people today look at food more than they eat”.
That some of the protagonists of these films experiment with fusion food also mirrors our growing intimacy with global cuisine. While Roshan Kalra creates the rotzza, Maachher Jhol's Dev D. succeeds in revitalizing his mother's senses by inventing a new preparation: the Komola Katla fish curry made with orange juice, which combines his haute cuisine knowledge with his basic cooking skills.

New visual language
Madhuja Mukherjee, associate professor of film studies at Kolkata's Jadavpur University, says food has been providing powerful imagery since the paintings of the European Renaissance. “Most of these images, which would have a lot of meat and fruits on the table, would convey opulence, excess and greed,” she says. Although there isn't a similar precedent in Indian art, Indian cinema has used it for “images loaded with values”.
“While eating meat would take religious overtones, wasting food would be shown as something bad that the rich people do.” This, she argues, comes from the memory of famine and poverty and is reflected in the symbolic value of the roti in the films of Mehboob Khan and Raj Kapoor.
Contemporary Indian films, she theorizes along the same lines as Menon, cater to an audience used to watching travel and living shows, where the dominant imagery is that of “masala being put into the kadhai (wok) in slow motion”. “There is a lot of exotic value to it. It's a new kind of visual culture about the details of everyday life, which is also connected to contemporary media content,” she says.
And yet, despite its deconstruction as a sociocultural device, there seems to be an element of mystery, a visceral quality, in how we experience food in films. As with smoking or eroticism, cinema has a way of making the forbidden seductive. It's hard to forget the appeal of the Big Kahuna Burger and $5 milkshake in Pulp Fiction (1994). In his book, Food, Film And Culture: A Genre Study, James R. Keller, a former professor at the Mississippi University for Women, US, compares food in cinema “to the arousal of the libido through romantic and sexual imagery, accessing the full sensory experience of the actor and, subsequently and vicariously, of the audience.”
The heart of food on film, then, lies in how people on screen engage with it. Otherwise, food stylists such as Kumar could have done the same job in Chef they do in commercials, making puris stuffed with tissue paper instead of serving them hot, fresh and real.
CEBU Vice Gov. Agnes Magpale advised the barangays in the province to intensify their Barangay Intelligence Network (BIN) and centralize the verification of reports about threats to security.
This came after the Provincial Government received texts and reports about alleged arrivals of Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) members in different cities and municipalities in the province when everybody was celebrating Holy Week. The reports turned out to be false.
The BIN is an anti-crime network created to improve a place's peace and order situation.
Magpale said this set-up should be strengthened especially in coastal barangays so that security threats can be quickly verified by the barangays. This will also stop unverified reports from circulating online, Magpale said.
As regards the Holy Week celebration, Magpale said it was generally peaceful in the Province despite the false reports.
In Cebu City, Mayor Tomas Osmeña said he is waiting for the approval from Pagcor to release funds for the four members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP) who died during the Inabanga encounter with the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG).
Osmeña requested for the release of P500,000 to each of the slain officers' families.
He said this is part of the city's contribution to protect the people of Inabanga, Bohol.
“It's a big amount, but the condition is very hard because we have to die first,” said Osmeña. CNU Interns Mary Nhel Dajao, Mara Gabilan
Vandals have once again targeted cables outside homes in Clitheroe to the dismay of residents.
However, instead of just cutting the satellite and aerial cables at homes on Waterloo Road they have this time completely removed the cables.
Four residents have reported cables stolen from their homes overnight last night to police and anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the police by dialling 101.
Earlier this week, from Sunday night into Monday, the Sky and telephone lines belonging to around 10 homes on Waterloo Road were sabotaged. Meanwhile, other residents discovered the wiring had been cut, leaving them without broadband and unable to watch television.
After hearing about the first incident, kind-hearted engineers from Accrington Aerials Ltd came to the aid of the residents and repaired the damage for free.
They subsequently received praise from the Rev. Andy Froud, priest-in-charge of Clitheroe Parish Church, who said their actions "restores my faith in human nature".
Vicente Cuellar
Vicente Cuellar
El Paso, Texas - An El Paso Jury sentenced an El Paso County man to life in prison after convicting him for Capital Murder in a "love triangle" murder.
On Monday, July 2, 2018, Vicente Cuellar was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
On December 9, 2015, sheriff's deputies responded to the 15000 block of N. Loop in Clint, Texas, to investigate an unattended death. The victim was identified as David Miranda.
An investigation led detectives to link Miranda's death with the burned body of a woman discovered inside a vehicle two days earlier on the 3000 block of Carlsbad Road in Fabens. She was later identified as Maria Cuellar.
On August 30, 2016, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office Major Crimes Unit arrested Vicente Cuellar and Alan Fraire on a charge of Capital Murder. Fraire's is still awaiting trial.
The autopsies show Maria Cuellar died of a gunshot wound to her side, while Miranda died from several gunshot wounds to his head and torso, according to court records obtained by the ABC-7 I-Team.
Investigators learned Vicente and Maria Cuellar were married, but were in the process of getting a divorce due to marital problems, the records show. The torched car in which Maria Cuellar was found was registered to her husband.
Maria Cuellar worked for the Clint Independent School District. A district spokesman told ABC-7 Maria Cuellar worked in the transportation department. Witnesses told investigators Maria Cuellar was having an affair with Miranda, a coworker, the court documents state. Investigators also learned from the district that neither Maria Cuellar nor Miranda had shown up to work and had not called in.
Vicente Cuellar told investigators he had not seen his wife since about 1 p.m. Dec. 7 at their home. He said he went to a mechanic shop, returned home, then went to Fraire's home, adding that he was at Fraire's home between 5 and 7 p.m. before he was taken home. Fraire also told investigators he was with Vicente Cuellar and that he took Cuellar home before taking his family to dinner.

Detectives were able to obtain the phone records of Fraire and Cuellar, according to the court documents. The phone records show Vicente Cuellar was traveling between the alleged crime scenes between 6:30 and 6:50 the night of the shootings. Records also show Fraire was at or near where Miranda's body was found right about the time when 15 to 20 gunshots were reported.The complaint affidavits for both Vicente Cuellar and Fraire state that detectives advised them that they were "dishonest with our investigation."
Investigators also said they found two distinct sets of footprints at both crime scenes. According to the court documents, detectives determined that two people committed the murders, saying it would require two people to drive the first victim's car, set it on fire and leave in a second vehicle. Witnesses told investigators the saw a red pickup leaving the scene of the shooting. Vicente Cuellar drives a red pickup, records show.
Cuellar and Fraire were arrested after an eight-month investigation by the Sheriff's Office Major Crimes Unit linked the two cases, the sheriff's office said.
Celebrities are known to go all out when it comes to Christmas decor—just look at the Kardashians' over-the-top trees—but not everyone decides to go big when decking the halls. Case in point: Rachel Bilson, who went for an understated Christmas tree thanks in part to her three-year-old daughter Briar Rose.
Bilson shared an Instagram of her decorated tree, and it's pint size to say the least. "When you let your three year old pick out the tree..... ," the Hart of Dixie alum wrote alongside a photo of their Charlie Brown tree.
When you let your three year old pick out the tree.....🎄 A post shared by @rachelbilson on Dec 11, 2017 at 7:37am PST
RELATED: Take a Tour of Rachel Bilson's $3.25 Million Post-Breakup Pad
What it lacks in fullness and height, the mother-daughter duo made up for in decor. They spruced up the tree with colored lights and decked out the six branches with bows and ornaments. It may be small, but it's certainly filled with holiday cheer.
Way to go, guys! We're pretty sure that Charlie Brown and Snoopy would love that lil' tree.

According tot he Daily Mails Australia, Queensland health authorities said last year's flu season was the worst in the state's history.
At least 52,000 people fell ill with the disease, with 5,653 of them ending up in hospital.
In the UK, at least 271 people are reported to have died during last winter's flu outbreak, with experts suggesting that figure may be an underestimate.
An "extremely rare" signed copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf is to be sold at a Clitheroe auction house this morning.
The blue cloth-covered 1935 edition bears the Nazi dictator's signature on the front fly leaf.
It was presented to former BBC and Oxford Mail journalist Peter Cadogan during a visit to Munich in the late 1930s.
It will be sold at Silverwoods auction house on Lincoln Way and is expected to raise more than £1,000.
Auctioneer James Thompson said some people "wouldn't touch anything Nazi with a bargepole", but others believe the book should be preserved, despite Hitler's appalling reign.
"In a way, it's a way to touch a monster," he added.
Mein Kampf, which translates as My Struggle, was first published in 1925 and sets out Hitler's political ideology and plans for Germany.
The example being sold is thought to be especially rare because Hitler was known to resist signing documents of any kind.
Let's say you can see that there are some home improvement tasks ahead of you. The bathroom faucets may need replacing. The kitchen cabinets may need refacing. As any homeowner knows, the possibilities are endless. Once you recognize a need, the question becomes: "How do I go about it?" This article offers tips to answer that question.
Painting a room is perhaps the cheapest home improvement you can carry out. A fresh coat of paint in a different shade or texture can completely transform a room for minimal cost. If your walls are not in the best condition and you don't have time to re-plaster them before painting, consider hanging wallpaper instead, to avoid drawing attention to the damage.
Place candles throughout your house. Candles can create a wonderful effect in your home. The effect will be heightened if the candle is scented with a good fragrance. You can place candles in bedrooms, bathrooms, and dining areas. Bathrooms especially benefit from the use of scented candles. Scented candles will give your house a homey feel.
Put your used paint brushes and rollers in plastic and in the fridge! If you are going to continue using the same paint in the near future there is no reason to wash out your brushes and rollers. Just seal them in a plastic bag and put them in the refrigerator. They will be usable for weeks!
The outside of your home also makes an excellent spot for a home improvement project. Staining your driveway adds a beautiful touch to the front of your residence. Also, look to see if you need to fill any cracks or re-tar the driveway. Sometimes, the front of your home can be forgotten as you make improvements, but these projects can really add a lot to the aesthetic value of your property.
If you are looking to install skylights or already have them in your home, it can be a costly item during summertime. In the summer months, the sun is shining overhead emitting lots of heat. The heat will require you to run your air conditioner at a higher level. However, in recent years, there has been high quality glazes developed that aid your windows in blocking out excessive heat and keeping it in during winter months. Talk to your local window dealer about the benefits of purchasing glazed windows.
When remodeling your kitchen or bath it may be wise not to do it yourself. These projects are extensive, time consuming, and much more involved than other home improvement projects. Often times it will actually save you money to hire a handy man or other licensed professional rather than take on these potentially monumental endeavors yourself.
Make sure you're working with a legitimate company when doing home improvement. If you can't get a physical address for a company and can only reach them by phone, they probably aren't all that big of a company. Select companies that have great reputations.
Ask your family members and friends for help before you start your next project to improve your home. You may not be able to locate anyone to give you a hand if you have begun. You might not be able to get the project done when you wanted to as well.
Avoid hiring an architect for minor home improvements and small renovations. Check your local building codes; in most areas architects are unnecessary for jobs below a certain size. Working with a competent contractor on these small-scale projects makes an architect unnecessary. When an architect is unnecessary and not required by local ordinances, save yourself some money by working without one.
Always shut off the water if working near pipes. Home improvement projects in the kitchen or bathroom may not always involve pipes, but shutting off the water can prevent any mishaps from becoming catastrophes. Know where your main water shut-off valve is, and use it any time you are working in these areas.
If someone in your household has long hair or you bathe shedding pets often, use a hair trap in the shower to prevent annoying clogs in the drain. There are a variety of models to fit different drain styles, but they all work by preventing hair from entering the drain and getting stuck in the trap.
If your water pressure has dropped, this might be an easily-diagnosed problem. Begin by making inquiries with the neighbors to see if they are also affected. If they aren't, then the problem resides in your home. Check the level of pressure at all of the faucets in your home to learn if its a problem that is throughout the entire house. A single faucet with poor pressure may only need an aerator adjustment; a house-wide problem may require professional assistance.
Use up-lighting behind large pieces of furniture to light up a dark corner. It is a dramatic and beautiful way to make the room seem larger than what it is. It is quick, easy and inexpensive and will make the room look as if it is a much larger and brighter space than what it really is.
To prevent a leaky roof make sure you do routine inspections for possible problems. You should do this after and major weather disturbances such as a strong storm, heavy rain or wind, hail storms, or heavy snow. Once you have found any discrepancies make sure you act on them right away.
As mentioned, a homeowner with little experience in home improvements may have a difficult time with any project. These projects could come down to having a bit of good luck if you choose not to get the help of professionals. Implement the tips given in this article on your next home improvement project.
In Weekend Tweets, Trump Lashes Out At Russia Influence Probe
NOEL KING, HOST:
President Trump has some choice words for the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, words like witch hunt and fake dossier and no collusion. The president tweeted all of that this weekend. He criticized Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. And then on Saturday, Trump's personal attorney, John Dowd, called for the investigation to be shut down entirely. NPR's Tamara Keith is here with more. She's our White House correspondent, and she hosts the NPR Politics podcast. Hi, Tam.
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi.
KING: So this seems like a much more aggressive posture from the president and his legal team than what we've been seeing.
KEITH: Especially from the president. You know? Up until this point, he has not called out Robert Mueller by name in tweets or otherwise. And now he is calling out Mueller by name, affiliating his name with the all-caps WITCH HUNT, exclamation point, in tweets, saying the probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. Those are President Trump's words. Meanwhile, his lawyer, John Dowd, said he was speaking for himself, but he said that the investigation should just be ended on the merits. But then (laughter), but then...
KING: There's always a but then (laughter).
KEITH: Yeah. The White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, who is - he is the lawyer charged with dealing with this special counsel investigation from within the White House, he put out a statement saying that once again, yet again - and he's put out this statement before - the president is not considering or discussing the firing of the special counsel Robert Mueller.
KING: I mean, there has been a tremendous amount of turnover at the White House in recent weeks, and so this sparks some speculation - well, maybe Trump will try to get rid of Mueller. Do you think that there's any chance the president would try that? Or, is that a bridge too far?
KEITH: Well, that is not a question I can answer for myself. But, you know, Republican members of Congress were out on the Sunday shows. Some said there's no way he would do that. Others issued some pretty stern warnings, including Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, who said that if the president were to try to push Mueller out, it would be the beginning of the end of the presidency. However, it is important to point out that we haven't heard much from Republican leadership. So although there are warnings coming from people like Senator Lindsey Graham, who's sort of a usual suspect, we aren't yet hearing from the top leaders of the Republican Party.
KING: Do we know anything at this point about the status of this investigation? The president wants it to end quickly. So does his legal team. Is it likely to?
KEITH: We don't have any answers on that because it is sort of a black box. Robert Mueller isn't showing his cards. But what we can say is that he has already secured a number of significant indictments and has cooperating witnesses. So this is a serious investigation that is underway and moving with haste.
KING: Tamara Keith covers the White House for NPR. Thanks, Tam.
KEITH: You're welcome.

MORE than 100 municipal employees, police officers and volunteers collected 50 sacks of trash on the shores of Santa Fe, Bantayan Island after the Holy Week.
Cebu Port Authority's record showed 35,000 people arrived in Sta. Fe for Holy Week.
Minor problems were encountered by the tourists, like lack of rooms to stay in.
The municipality cleaned up the shoreline last Sunday, which has been the practice of the town after Holy Week.
Next year, Santa Fe plans to implement a zero waste policy.
An ordinance has been recently passed for this.
There was only a drizzle in Sta. Fe last Sunday, as opposed to the heavy rains and flooding in mainland Cebu.
Market Scenario:
Super capacitors batteries are higher capacity electrochemical capacitor with very high capacitance value.

Bristol Rugby made a remarkable second half comeback on Saturday to come within three points of victory against Bath on Saturday.
The Greene King IPA Championship side trailed by 27 points, 34-7, at the halfway point in their second pre-season game of the summer, but an impressive second half saw Bristol shut out Bath and score three tries to finish down 31-34 at the final whistle.
Despite naming a side missing most of their international players, Aviva Premiership side Bath came flying out of the blocks at Clifton RFC which doubles up as Bristol's training ground.
Bath opened the scoring through a penalty goal from Josh Lewis before booker Jack Walker powered over for a close range try, converted by Walker.
Shortly after England U20s captain, and a rising star in the English game, Zach Mercer crossed the line after a fine break from Tom Homer.
A third try soon followed when a quick tap penalty ended with Darren Allinson scoring a converted try.
Bristol finally got off the mark through a familiar figure as Tom Varndell showed his pace and power to finish in the corner after he was put away by teenager Charlie Powell.
However Bath struck what proved to be the killer blow in the final 10 minutes of the first half as wingers Jack Wilson and Matt Banahan both touched down for unconverted tries
However Bristol were not dead and buried just yet and within seven minutes of the second half they had crossed the whitewash twice.
First, Aaron Chapman stretched over after a flowing counter, before Jordan Williams touched down following a stunning fifty metre break, while Callum Sheedy added the conversion.
The fightback continued on the hour mark as Dan Thomas spotted a gap to cross through a pile of bodies, moving Bristol within ten points at 24-34.
In the final play of the game, debutant Luke Morahan capped an impressive team performance in the second forty, finishing off a slick move to go in under the posts on his debut.

In 2015, mobile wallets were the flavour of the month. A new wallet was being launched every week. However, we felt that prepaid instruments created walled gardens, and Indian consumers deserved open, interoperable payment networks. So, we were pitching our vision of building an interoperable P2P-payments app on top of IMPS to bankers in Mumbai. Not surprisingly, by January 2016, most banks had unceremoniously laughed us out of the building. But then out of nowhere, NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) announced a series of “UPI Hackathons” in February 2016. We attended the Bengaluru event where the CEO of NPCI announced that they would be launching an interoperable payments network with open developer APIs. This network, named UPI, was to be launched shortly. ICICI, Yes Bank, RBL and other banks confirmed that they would be launch partners for UPI. Despite our slight cynicism, we felt like this might be the real deal!
Overnight, we suspended all our IMPS-related experimentation, and pivoted all our efforts towards UPI. First, we started actively finding a sponsor bank for UPI. Few banks had started working on their UPI stack, and among them Yes Bank agreed to sponsor us first. The next few months were spent drinking lots of coffee and doing countless iterations on our v1 Mobile App launch.
In late August 2016, a few days after the UPI network went live, we launched the PhonePe Android app. The early days were super exciting, but HDFC, SBI, Kotak and several other large banks were still missing on the UPI network. We assumed it would take 18-24 months for them to join UPI.
Then serendipity happened again! Demonetisation was announced in November, 2016. Overnight, all major banks started joining UPI and PhonePe had been downloaded by more than 10 million people.

– The Knoxville Ice Bears scored twice in the third period to come from behind and beat the Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs, 3-2, Friday night at Berglund Center. Joe Sova and Riley Spraggs each scored for the Dawgs in the loss.
Roanoke got on the board first in the first period. Matt Beer kicked the puck to Steve Mele along the left wing boards. Mele then lofted a pass to Joe Sova, who blasted a one-timer past Troy Davenport to give the Dawgs a 1-0 lead.
Knoxville evened things up early in the second. From just inside the attacking zone, David Brancik fed the puck to Stefan Brucato on the right wing. He stepped in and fired a shot over the left shoulder of Matt Zenzola, tying the game at one.
Late in the second period with the teams skating four-on-four, Cam Bakker received a pass in the high slot. He darted the puck to Riley Spraggs in tight. Spraggs roofed a backhander over Davenport to give Roanoke a 2-1 lead going into the second intermission.
Knoxville again tied the game near the halfway point in the third on a Kristaps Nimanis slap shot from the point. The Ice Bears took the lead late in the third when Marcus Ortiz fed Dean Yakura off a rush. Yakura's wrist shot sailed past Zenzola, pushing the score to 3-2.
The Dawgs had chances late in the third period, notably after Knoxville committed a penalty with just 3:03 remaining on the clock. Roanoke was unable to put anything else past Davenport however as they came up short in a 3-2 loss.
Sova and Spraggs both scored while Bakker picked up his first point as a Rail Yard Dawg. Zenzola made 19 saves on 22 shots while Davenport stopped 26 of 28 to earn the win in net.
Roanoke moved to 11-19-3 with the loss while Knoxville improved to 20-11-2. The Rail Yard Dawgs and Ice Bears will complete their home-and-home weekend set on Saturday night in Knoxville. Puck drop at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum is scheduled for 7:35 PM.

A new provision approved by The Scottish Parliament today (Tuesday) will see Humanist Society Scotland officially recognised as the first non-religious organisation to be ‘prescribed' under the 1977 Marriage Act.
The move means that people who wish to conduct humanist ceremonies, known as celebrants, will no longer have to go through the Registrar General of Scotland. HSS will now be able to authorise its own celebrants.
The Humanist Society Scotland (HSS) was responsible for securing a change in 2005 to allow Scotland to become the first part of the UK to allow legal Humanist wedding ceremonies.
Since then the popularity of Humanist weddings has increased with more than 4,200 ceremonies taking place in 2015.
Lynsey Kidd, HSS Head of ceremonies and chaplaincy, said the society is delighted to be recognised for its representation of the Humanist community in Scotland.
She said: “Our HSS registered celebrants are trained to a high professional standard, and undertake regular development to ensure that they can deliver a first class service.
“This new status reflects the Scottish Government's confidence in Humanist Society Scotland to authorise their own Celebrants and provides our members choosing an HSS Registered Celebrant even more assurance that with us they are in safe hands.
“Such a significant change to the marriage landscape in Scotland means that Humanist Society Scotland is given recognition as Scotland's national Humanist Charity”
Gordon MacRae, HSS Chief Executive, also added: “Last year saw a tipping point for Humanism in Scotland, with the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey showing that non-religious people in Scotland are the majority, continued growth in demand for meaningful Humanist ceremonies, and real progress in our campaign for inclusive secular education.
Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie was asked if he is worried about teammate Eli Apple.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no,” he said.
And then he paused and thought about the question again.
“Sometimes.”
This would seem to be one of those times. Last year's first-round pick has missed four straight games because of a lack of practice reps and during Sunday's game against the Cowboys he was tweeting while the rest of his teammates were losing. Those actions, against NFL rules, resulted in a conversation with interim head coach Steve Spagnuolo.
“I was disappointed,” Spagnuolo said. “I told him I was disappointed. We'll decide exactly what we'll do with it, but it was disappointing. He apologized and we'll move on.”
That one of those in-game posts was a retweet of a highlight of Cowboys running back Rod Smith (a former Ohio State teammate of Apple's) scoring on an 81-yard catch-and-run and then celebrating, raised a few eyebrows.
“That's a tough one,” Rodgers-Cromartie said.
Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.
Spagnuolo said he was not aware of the content of the tweets.
The latest incident caps what has been a tumultuous month for Apple, who has not played in a game since the Nov. 12 contest in San Francisco in which his effort on some plays was brought into question and displayed during a harsh film session in front of the entire team. According to a report he threatened to leave the building over the treatment, but Apple has denied that.
He missed the games in Weeks 11 and 12 because he was excused from practices to attend to a family medical issue, had a hip injury spring up right before he was ruled inactive for Week 13, and said he was feeling “fine” before not playing on Sunday.
“I said: ‘Look, we need to get you going, everybody wants you here helping us out, but this wasn't the week to do it,' ” Spagnuolo said of telling Apple he wouldn't play against the Cowboys. “He didn't get enough reps during the week. He did get some on Friday, I just didn't think it was enough to have him ready to do the things we were going to do in the defensive game plan and he understood that. The goal there as we shook hands and hugged was let's get you up and running next week.”
All of which leads to what feels like a crossroads in Apple's brief tenure with the Giants. It's something Rodgers-Cromartie said he has seen a number of times, and even lived through.
“Being a young guy, it's kind of hard to deal with those things if you don't have somebody that you can lean on in the locker room,” Rodgers-Cromartie said. “That's why I always try to talk to him and just let him know I've been there where you've been, trust me. He's seen me go about my way and I try to tell him that from the standpoint of doing things the wrong way and I don't want to see him go down that path. So I always try to stay on him.”
Does it sink in?
“It's hard to tell,” he said. “I can say he comes in here with the right mindset as far as coming in every day. He puts his stuff on, he goes out there and practices and he does what is asked of him. So I think for the most part, he gets it.”
There's that other part, though. There's that “sometimes.”
Rodgers-Cromartie acknowledged that talented players often need a fresh start with a new team, but he's cautioned Apple about that.
“Coming from a guy that's been on multiple teams, you don't want to try to go to different teams, start over again, try to prove yourself again,” he said. “If you get drafted somewhere, you really want to stay there. They truly have your best interest. If you go somewhere else, you get lost in the shuffle and all kinds of stuff.”
Rodgers-Cromartie seemed to come through his maturity issues and last for a decade in the NFL, even if it has been with four different teams. Apple, he said, has the talent to do the same thing. Not everyone does.
Asked about the percentage of young players who rebound from off years to fulfill their potential, Rodgers-Cromartie said: “It ain't high, I can tell you that much, but it's possible. I think it all depends on that person and how much they're willing to take whatever is going to come at them and use it to better themselves. It always depends on that man.”
“He's struggling,” Spagnuolo said of Apple's personal matters. “Sometimes it takes a little while to recover from that. I'm not saying that that's an excuse, but he's got to step up, show his teammates, his coaches, that he's ready. I believe he wants to and is going to do that. We just need to see him do it.”

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang linked up with his new Arsenal team-mates on the training ground for the first time on Friday, ahead of the Gunners' weekend clash with Everton.
The Gabon international, who is a Arsenal signed for £56million on deadline day, trained by himself at London Colney on Thursday, in a bid to get match fit for Saturday's fixture.
Aubameyang could make his debut for the north London club against the Toffees, and link up with his former Dortmund team-mate Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
Ahead of the match, here are five questions that need to be answered.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
1. Will Aubameyang be playing on Saturday?
We'll start with the elephant in the room; will Arsenal's new £56million signing make his debut at the Emirates, and perhaps more importantly, will he hit the ground running?
The fact the Gabon striker hit the training ground all by himself on Thursday, before doing it all again with his team-mates on Friday, suggests he will definitely be playing for the Gunners on Saturday.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
But Wenger threw this into doubt in his press conference, when he announced that the player has been suffering with illness.
"Certainly Mkhitaryan will start," said Wenger on Friday. "That's a possibility, yes. Aubameyang, I have to assess how he is physically today and how well he feels.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
"He had sickness, a fever. He couldn't train a lot, he started yesterday. He was still not completely well so I have to assess and see with the medical department how well and how fit he can be."
Whether he will start - or come off the bench - on Saturday remains a mystery, but it seems that regardless of what fate has in store for the 28-year-old, he is desperate to play.
2. Will Mkhitaryan and Aubameyang rekindle a partnership?
Another big question that Arsenal will be hoping is the case; will Mkhitaryan and Aubameyang get on like they did all those years ago at Dortmund?
Things have changed since then, of course, but there is no denying that the duo struck up a partnership in Germany, that worked to the Bundesliga giants' favour on more than one occasion.
When asked the killer question on Friday, Wenger said: "I hope so, yes. They know each other well. We are an offensive team, hopefully they can recreate that understanding."
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
Back in the 2015-2016 season Aubameyang found the back of the net 39 times while Mkhitaryan, who usually played a little deeper, scored 23.
If the duo can get anywhere near these figures at Arsenal then Gunners fans are in for a few treats from here until the end of the season.
One potential issue is that both players - who you'd think will be regulars in the first team - are attack-minded, which could leave Arsenal short at the back.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
Speaking about this on Sky Sports, Gary Neville said: "Those four are so attacking I can't think of a defensive mind among them. I watched Mkhitaryan at United, he doesn't defend.
"Ozil, when he wants to he can, but he doesn't really want to put it in defensively. They're going to leave huge spaces.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
"The situation poses Wenger a problem he will have to try and resolve on the training pitch. That is the problem – how do you fit all four in the same team?
"I'm not quite sure that will happen. It doesn't look like a natural fit, so Arsene Wenger has got some big challenges on the training field to make those four into a unit that works."
3. What does the future hold for Lacazette?
The France international promised the world when Arsenal spent £52million on him in the summer, making him the most expensive purchase in their history.
But just a few months later and Wenger - who of course was forced to react to losing Alexis Sanchez - delved into the transfer market once again and spent even more on Aubameyang.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
The two players are similar in that they're out-and-out forwards with plenty of pace and - when in form - have the ability to score goals for fun.
So you'd think Wenger will be looking to play one over the other, which doesn't look good for the 26-year-old former Lyon forward.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
What's more Wenger refused to give the Frenchman any clarity over his future at the club in his Friday press conference, telling the media: "I don't reassure people. We are in a competitive world.
"We have also chosen a job where there is competition, you have to fight for your place."
4. What can we expect from Ozil?
For so long Mesut Ozil's future has been up in the air; will he sign a new contract at Arsenal, will he return to Spain, will he join Manchester United?
The German put all the speculation, rumour, and nonsense to bed this week when he penned a new £350,000-a-week contract at the Emirates - much to the delight of Gunners supporters.
The deal will see him remain an Arsenal player until 2021, and means that the Gunners will enjoy the playmaker in his prime years.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
So what now? Well, the German has previously been accused of 'being lazy' or 'going missing' in big games, which was used as apparent evidence that his mind was elsewhere and that he was going to leave.
This notion can no longer be thrown about, meaning fans will expect better and more consistent performances from the German.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
Not only this but because he's now being paid £350,000-a-week - making him the highest paid player at the club by some margin - the board will expect the same.
Wenger confirmed the pressure to perform is now definitely on Ozil's shoulder on Friday, saying: "Many predicted he wouldn't commit and not sign.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
"It is good news for us - if you can keep a player of that calibre is of course good news.
"He has committed his future to the club at a period where we are in a tricky period. [Now] we expect him to take responsibility to lead the club to success."
5. Will Cech bounce back against Everton?
The goalkeeper, who hasn't been in the best of form for a while now, had a game to forget in Arsenal's embarrassing 3-1 defeat to Swansea City last time out.
Against the Swans, Nacho Monreal threw the ball back to Shkodran Mustafi, who laid it back to a hurried Cech in the Arsenal goal.
The shot-stopper could only scuff his clearance though, and a grateful Jordan Ayew prodded the loose ball into the net.
(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)
To make matters worse, Arsenal have since been linked with a move for Atletico Madrid keeper Jan Oblak.
The Slovenian is widely regarded to be one of the best shot-stoppers in the world, and would command a hefty transfer fee.
(Image: REUTERS)
But the Gunners have proved this January that they're now willing to spend cash on transfer fees and pay large wages.
Cech needs to bounce back against Everton for the sake of his future at the club, or he might just find himself on the scrapheap come June.

New Delhi: The government on Monday strictly asked TV channels not to air advertisements selling and promoting condoms because these are "indecent especially for children" and can create "unhealthy practices" among them.
"It has been brought to the notice of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that some channels carry advertisements of condoms repeatedly which are alleged to be indecent especially for children," an advisory from the ministry said.
The advisory invoked Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, banning an "advertisement which endangers the safety of children or create in them any interest in unhealthy practices or shows them begging or in an undignified or indecent manner".
"In view of the above, all TV channels are hereby advised not to telecast the advertisements of condoms which are for a particular age group and could be indecent/inappropriate for viewing by children. Indecent, vulgar, suggestive, repulsive or offensive themes or treatment shall be avoided in all advertisements.
It said such advertisements may be telecast between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. to avoid exposure of such material to children.
"Any failure will attract action as per provisions of the rules," said the advisory.
The missive comes after the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) requested the ministry earlier this month to take a call on such ads and their telecast timing.
In September, a condom advertisement featuring Sunny Leone drew protests from a Surat-based group. The ad, which was displayed on hoardings across the city and carried a message in Gujarati "play but with love" was shared on social media by people. City-based group Hindu Yuva Vahini staged a protest at one of the locations where the hoarding was displayed.

LANSING (WWJ/AP) – A Michigan State University trustee and former NFL player has been charged with assault following a dispute over a referee's calls during a girls' basketball tournament.
The Lansing State Journal reported Friday that Mitch Lyons was coaching one of the teams when he allegedly pushed a referee after a December game. Lyons faces a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery.
His attorney says Lyons, who has been a university trustee since 2011, denies the allegations.
The referee told police that he had to make a couple calls that caused one team to lose, then issued two technical fouls following a verbal dispute that followed. The ref said coach confronted him after the game and twice pushed him in the chest with his hands.
Lyons played football from 1988 to 1992 at Michigan State before spending seven years in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Atlanta Falcons.
The charge comes amid other troubles for Lyons, as some have called for all MSU trustees to resign on accusations the university ignored or mishandled reports of abuse by then campus sport doctor Larry Nassar.
Lyons made headlines last week as the first board member calling for the ouster of MSU president Lou Anna Simon, who has since resigned.
A court hearing in Lyons' assault case is set for Feb. 12.

Tweed Byron Local Area Command Detective Superintendent Wayne Starling said the crash would have been a confronting sight for first responders and locals. Picture: Mike Batterham.
POLICE have criticised dozens of "sightseers" who brought their children to watch emergency crews try and save the lives of four people at a grisly crash scene.
A mother and daughter were killed - and two others left in a critical condition - in northern NSW on Sunday afternoon when their rental car left Clothiers Creek Road in a high-speed crash.
The family of four Asian tourists were coming back from a day trip to Byron Bay about 4.20pm. Police believe the grandmother, aged 64, and mother, 46, passed away at the scene while a father, 47, and son, 14, were rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries.
Tweed Byron Local Area Command Detective Superintendent Wayne Starling said he was shocked at the behaviour of locals who pulled over with their children to see what would have been a confronting sight for emergency crews.
"When the accident occurred, you had parents taking their children to look down at these people who were probably in a very sad state.

Care-free drivers are risking up to £114 million in rejected car insurance claims every single year thanks to seemingly innocent slip-ups such as forgetting to renew their road tax and even wearing the wrong footwear.
That's according to new research by Uswitch, which revealed that two thirds of drivers are putting their future payouts at risk by making simple - and frivolous - mistakes that could void their policy out entirely.
In a list of the most common misdemeanors made by motorists, the comparison website revealed wearing heels or flip flops as the easiest way to get your insurance written off.
A quarter of drivers sampled by Uswitch said they've worn this type of footwear whilst driving.

The report also found many motorists were unaware that items hanging from their windscreen or rear-view mirror that obstruct their view could invalidate their cover.

The survey of 1,593 consumers found the most forgetful drivers are dotted around Birmingham, where one in three people on the road routinely forget to lock their cars.

In Wales, 26% of drivers also frequently forget to renew their MOTs on time.
Simple errors, which also involve forgetting to strap in your pet, could mean that British drivers lose out on £114million each year in unpaid claims based on an average claim amount of £2,671, according to Association of British Insurers' research.

A quarter of drivers admitted they did not realise these small errors could result in car insurance providers not paying out, with an additional third of drivers admitting they simply forget that such behaviours might impact on an insurance claim.

The latest data from the ABI shows that over 43,000 car insurance claims are rejected a year.
Rod Jones, insurance expert at Uswitch.com, said: "We know the British public are increasingly time poor, so it's unsurprising that motorists can be forgetful when it comes to locking up their cars or renewing their car MOT and taxes on time.
"With claims now running into the thousands of pounds, people can't afford to make a careless mistake that could invalidate their cover and leave them out of pocket.
"It is therefore really important that drivers note down their key renewal dates, and avoid making the easy to forget mistakes to ensure they are covered by should they ever need to make a claim."

'Bathroom Bill' Fight Brewing In Texas
Enlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP
Texas could soon follow in the footsteps of Indiana and North Carolina and pass its own "bathroom bill" in the upcoming legislative session. Lt. Governor Dan Patrick has made passage of such a bill, which could require transgender Texans to use the restroom which corresponds to their gender on their birth certificate, a priority.
The proposal threatens to split the Texas Republican Party, which controls all three branches of government in Austin. Proponents include the Texas lieutenant governor and the Senate he leads, while the Texas House of Representatives is more sympathetic to the state's business community that includes the politically powerful chamber of commerce and the Texas Association of Business which strongly oppose any bathroom bill.
North Carolina's bathroom bill nullified legislation passed by the city of Charlotte that expanded protections to LGBT North Carolinians. The state's bathroom bill also prohibited transgender people from using public restrooms that align with their gender identity. It provoked a widespread backlash from businesses, entertainers, sports organizations and the movie industry.
The NBA pulled its All-Star game out of North Carolina, the NCAA moved March Madness regional games out of the state, and PayPal and Deutsche Bank suspended planned expansions there. Forbes estimated that North Carolina lost more than $600 million in the six months after North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed the legislation into a law. McCrory was subsequently defeated in his bid for re-election in November by Democrat Roy Cooper who made the bathroom bill a cornerstone of his successful campaign.
None of these economic and political ramifications have deterred Texas Lt. Governor Patrick however. In fact, when the North Carolina legislature failed an attempt to reverse itself and pass legislation which would have nullified its bathroom bill just before Christmas, Patrick sent a note applauding the collapse of the effort.
"Legislation to protect women's privacy and business is essential to assure that sexual predators ... will not be able to freely enter women's restrooms, locker rooms or showers ...," Patrick's note said.
However many of the Texas GOP's most lucrative donors have indicated they're going to go to the mat to stop bathroom legislation from passing in Texas. The Texas Association of Business held a press conference last month to announce results of a study commissioned by the TAB and conducted by researchers at St. Edwards University in Austin, which estimated a Lone Star bathroom bill could cost the state upwards of $8 billion in economic impact and 100,000 jobs.
"The message from the Texas business community is loud and clear," Chris Wallace, president of the TAB said in front of the Texas Capitol. "Protecting Texas from billions of dollars in losses is simple: Don't pass unnecessary laws that discriminate against Texans and our visitors."
While Texas's lieutenant governor is hot for a bathroom bill, his counterpart in the Texas House, Speaker Joe Strauss is not, saying, "This isn't the most urgent concern of mine."
Strauss is expected to be the business community's political backstop and if he so wishes, he's got the clout in the House to ensure that any bathroom legislation languishes and dies in committee. Not only would that please many influential donors, it would spare Republican House members from having to make a politically tricky vote.
And where is Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on the subject? He's currently sitting atop the fence. Abbott says a wait and see approach is the prudent course until an actual bill is produced and the details (and political and economic ramifications) can be carefully scrutinized.
× CEOs outraged after Charlottesville – and two quit Trump council
President Trump's initial failure to condemn white supremacy on Saturday was too much for Kenneth Frazier.
Early Monday morning, the head of the pharma giant Merck — and one of America's most prominent black CEOs — abruptly quit Trump's manufacturing council.
Frazier's message was clear: “America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.”
Trump quickly responded by bashing Frazier. He tweeted that the Merck CEO “will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!”
Hours later, Trump denounced the KKK, neo-Nazis and White supremacists as “repugnant.”
Throughout the day, other CEOs on the manufacturing council condemned racism after the weekend's white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. But by Monday night, only one other had joined Frazier in leaving.
Under Armour's Kevin Plank had earlier tweeted a strong rejection of racism. Then, just after 8 p.m. ET, his company released a statement saying that he would step down.
“Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics,” Plank said.
CNNMoney asked the approximately two dozen executives whether they would stay on the council. Several executives denounced hate and bigotry, others declined to comment, and some did not respond at all.
Related: CEOs condemn racism after Charlottesville
But at least seven companies or executives said that they would remain with the council, which was formed in January to advise Trump on manufacturing growth — a key focus of the president's campaign.
General Electric said the company has “no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism.” But it added that chairman Jeff Immelt would stay on the council because it was important for GE to “participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S.”
Representatives for at least five other companies — Dow Chemical, Whirlpool, Campbell Soup, International Paper and Nucor — echoed similar sentiments.
They all released statements that condemned racism or welcomed tolerance. But they also said they'd stay on the council so they could advise the government on ways to strengthen manufacturing.
Dell said there was “no change” in how it is “engaging with the Trump administration” on policy issues that affect the company.
Another CEO, Intel's Brian Krzanich, railed against hate speech and white supremacy in a tweet. But he did not say anything about his role on the council.
Frazier and Plank are not the first CEOs to drop out of a Trump advisory role. At first, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk defended his roles on Trump's manufacturing and economic advisory councils.
While Musk publicly and repeatedly rebuked several Trump policies, including the travel ban, he said he believed having a seat at the table was “doing good.” The clean energy advocate spoke publicly about wanting to advise Trump on climate issues, even though the president downplayed the problem.
Related: From racism to climate change, CEOs keep turning on Trump
Musk eventually gave up. After Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement in June, he left both councils.
“Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk tweeted at the time. He had earlier said that he had “done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils.”
Disney's Bob Iger, another member of the economic advisory council, also quit after the Paris decision.
And at least one more departure from the manufacturing group may be in the works.
The AFL-CIO, which has two members on the council, said Monday that it denounces “bigoted domestic terrorists” and called on Trump to follow. Its president, Richard Trumka, made similar comments online Sunday.
By Monday afternoon the AFL-CIO said it was “assessing” its role in the manufacturing group — which it said “has yet to hold any real meeting.”
“While the AFL-CIO will remain a powerful voice for the freedoms of working people, there are real questions about the effectiveness of this council to deliver real policy that lifts working families,” the organization said.
In other words: Maybe this just isn't worth it.

The 5 Best Financing Options for Veterans
Because U.S. military veterans have all the traits needed to become a great entrepreneur, but they don't always have access to the necessary funds to start their business.
President Donald Trump's setbacks on campaign promises like repealing the Affordable Care Act and his shifting positions on other stances look like they're catching up with him — bigly.
A new poll from Gallup released early yesterday finds that a majority of Americans no longer view Trump as keeping his promises, with poll numbers on that question falling from 62 percent in February to 45 percent in early April, a stunning 17 percentage-point tumble.
The drop was seen across every demographic group: women, men, millennials, baby boomers and people with political leanings of all kinds. While numbers sank the furthest among respondents who identified as a Democrat or liberal, independents who said they thought Trump kept his promises fell from 59 percent to 43 percent; even among Republicans, the numbers fell, from 92 percent to 81 percent.
The poll, taken between April 5 and April 9, showed that Trump's ratings fell on all six presidential leadership characteristics that Gallup measures.
The percentage who think he is a “strong and decisive leader” also took a big hit, falling from 59 percent to 52 percent. So did the number of people who think he can “bring about changes this country needs,” which fell seven percentage points, too, to 46 percent. Just 36 percent see him as “honest and trustworthy,” compared with 42 percent in February.

On two other measures, whether Trump “cares about the needs of people like you” and “can manage the government effectively,” the president's numbers also fell, though Gallup noted those declines were not statistically significant.
The ratings dive was most stark when it came to women who think Trump keeps his promises — just 40 percent now say he does, compared with 65 percent in February, a striking 25 percentage-point plunge.
In a write-up of the results, Gallup explained that the numbers came following Trump's defeat over repealing the Affordable Care Act, as supporters have become unhappy he hasn't done more on taxes and immigration while detractors are upset he hasn't protected middle- and working-class Americans.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) - A federal jury has convicted a Virginia woman on fraud and tax charges after prosecutors said she charged over a half-million dollar on her boss's credit cards.
Sherea Darnell is a former manager at a Williamsburg eye care center. Prosecutors say she used the doctor's credit cards to charge some $514,000 in personal transactions, including her son's preschool tuition.
The jury heard from prosecutors that she also took over $90,000 in cash advances from the credit cards, using it to hire maid services and buy clothing and airline tickets. Authorities say that after her resignation from the eye center, Darnell continued to use her boss's cards until the doctor finally discovered the fraud.
Darnell faces a maximum penalty of 30 years. Sentencing is set for October.

Labour are planning their own Glastonbury-style music festival to celebrate Jeremy Corbyn 's upsurge in support.
Party figures are planning a day-long event to take place in North London in June.
It comes after the Labour leader was given a rapturous reception at last year's Glastonbury, where he gave a speech from the Pyramid Stage.
Earlier last year, he was given a roaring welcome at a Libertines gig in Hyde Park, where the huge crowd spontaneously broke into a noisy chorus of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn.”

Labour are reportedly hoping 10,000 supporters will turn up to the festival, which will feature left-leaning music acts and political speakers.
Names for the event currently under discussion include “The People's Party” and “Labour Live.”
A Labour spokesperson said: “We are exploring options for ways to continue to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour's message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few.”
(Image: Daily Mirror)
Not everyone in the party is thrilled at the prospect of a Corbyn-themed music festival.
One Labour insider said: “Well I've said I'm not f*****g staffing it.
“Can you imagine being asked if Jeremy was pilled up or smoking blunts with Stormzy? It's a disaster.”
Music and politics are not always happy bedfellows.
The Leave.EU campaign planned an all day event in Birmingham ahead of the EU Referendum , entitled BPop Live.
The event was eventually cancelled when a string of proposed headliners, including (three members of) boyband 5ive and East 17, pulled out rather than share a stage with then-Ukip leader Nigel Farage.
The final nail in the coffin for the ill-fated festival was when the Electoral Commission warned that if it were to go ahead it would most likely break campaign spending limits.
At the time of cancellation, the remaining acts who had agreed to perform at the event included three quarters of Buck's Fizz and Gordon Hendricks, Stoke-on-Trent's premier Elvis impersonator.
Amazon Wants To Deliver Packages Inside Your Car
Enlarge this image toggle caption Amazon Amazon
From the company that brought you the option of letting a courier inside your home comes a new service: package delivery inside your car.
Amazon is expanding its in-home delivery service called Key to include deliveries to trunks and back seats of cars. The service is available only to Amazon Prime members in 37 cities who have a 2015 or newer Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac or Volvo with an active OnStar or Volvo On Call account.
Essentially, these are already connected cars that can be remotely unlocked — in this case for package delivery, which Amazon promises within a four-hour window. The shopper has to confirm that they've parked within range of the delivery location — in a publicly accessible area — and can track the progress through the Amazon Key app.
Amazon has devoted much effort to figuring out how to stop its packages from being stolen from porches and public spaces, which is costing the company a pretty penny. With in-car service, Amazon can use shoppers' cars as secure mail drop boxes.
This is also the extension of Amazon's ongoing effort to come up with new ways to lure customers into its universe with convenience and speed. Early on, it was free two-day shipping for people who pay a monthly or yearly Prime subscription. Then came Internet-connected buttons that auto-order a specific item and shopping via voice commands to a smart home device. Now, it's remotely controlled, app-connected locks on houses and cars to let couriers inside.
In February, Amazon bought Ring, a smart-doorbell maker that can stream audio and video a phone, which followed the launch of the company's own Internet-connected home security camera called Cloud Cam. Amazon has pitched the camera and its Amazon Key app for use not just for in-home deliveries, but also keyless entry for a growing number of home-service providers that can be hired through Amazon, such as dog walkers and house cleaners.
Most of the special services appeal to Prime subscribers, a membership service that typically costs $99 a year in the U.S. — one that Amazon is aggressively growing. Last week, for the first time, CEO Jeff Bezos disclosed that the number of Prime subscribers topped 100 million.
General Motors' OnStar and Volvo On Call are also subscription services, which tend to come with some free-of-charge periods but can run up to $350 a year.

OnePlus 6 has already been put through stringent tests. It has been torn down, burnt, bent, and scratched. But the water resistance of the phone is yet to be tested. OnePlus has never mentioned the IP-rating of the device, probably to save the cost of the certification.
Now, YouTuber JerryRigEverything in a new video exposes the water resistivity of the OnePlus 6. So what's the actual water resistance capability of the OnePlus 6? Watch the video to find out.
As for the specifications, the OnePlus 6 is fitted with a 6.28-inch FHD+ Full Optic display with a resolution of 2280 x 1080 pixels. The smartphone makes use of a Snapdragon 845 SoC paired with 6GB/8GB RAM and 64GB/128GB/256GB storage space, which cannot be expanded further.
There is a dual-camera setup at its rear with a 16MP primary sensor and a 20MP secondary sensor. There are camera features such as OIS and EIS as well. The selfie camera is a 16MP sensor and is housed inside the notch on top of the display.
The device was launched with Android 8.1 Oreo topped with OxygenOS. It has received a slew of updates in the past few days taking it to Android P Beta and bringing in many other features and improvements. The OnePlus 6 Marvel Avengers Limited Edition model will go on sale for the first time at 12 PM today on Amazon India. This special edition model comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage space. It carries a price tag of Rs. 44,999.
The company also added the Always-On Display feature to the device but removed it with the latest update. Though lack of an Always-on Display feature might not be a dealbreaker, it's still intriguing why the company put it in the first place.
According to a thread on Reddit, a OnePlus customer support representative stated that the reason company removed the feature was "due to a battery-saving concern." While there's no doubt that the feature would drain the battery, it's unclear why would OnePlus remove the choice altogether. A simple battery drain warning with the on/off toggle would have done the trick for the company. The users could choose whether to use the feature or not.
DUBLIN — The Lady Knights gave it all they had for a half, but fatigue and foul trouble began to wear them down as visiting St. Pauls used a big third quarter to run off with a 59-26 Three Rivers Conference win on Friday.
West Bladen falls to 5-15 overall, 3-12 in the conference.
The Lady Knights got a three-pointer from Seniah Johnson to help open a 9-7 edge after the first quarter of play, and that lead went to 13-7 when West Bladen opened the second stanza with a quick four points.
But the Lady Bulldogs went on a 6-0 spurt to knot the game at 13-13 before West Bladen opened leads of 16-13 and 18-15. St. Pauls, however, finished the half on a 6-0 run and took a 21-18 advantage into halftime.
That momentum continued for the visitors, as the Lady Bulldogs exploded for a 23-5 burst through the third quarter and opened a 44-23 lead going into the fourth frame.
St. Pauls completed a 38-8 run through the second half with a 15-3 advantage in the final eight minutes of play to seal the 33-point win.
“Just not enough bodies to find any groove we once had,” West Bladen coach Brian McCleney said.
Johnson led the lady Knights with five points, all in the first quarter, while Patience Parker had four points and three steals; Chasitty Lacey had four points and five rebounds; Nyasia Ellison grabbed five boards; and Conner Brisson had four rebounds.
West Bladen will go on the road Tuesday to Tabor City for a conference game with South Columbus at 6 p.m.
Juan Bucio, a Chicago Fire Department diver, died while searching for a missing boater in the Chicago River.
An investigation continued Wednesday into how Juan Bucio, a veteran Chicago Fire Department diver, died during a rescue attempt on the Chicago River on Memorial Day Bucio, 46, died while searching for boater Alberto Lopez, 28, who still has not been found after falling into the Chicago River's South Branch.A closer look at video, shot by an ABC7 photographer moments before Bucio disappeared under the water, shows him and his partner in trouble as a fire department boat comes by.A source said that something may have been wrong with Bucio - a 15-year CFD veteran -- before he went under.As crews on the boat called out to Bucio and his partner, the video shows Bucio go under the front of the boat while his partner puts his hands on the side to prevent himself from following.Then there is a frantic search. Later, rescue crews pulled Bucio's body out of the river.A source said the video shows Bucio too low in the water, signaling a possible sign of trouble.The Chicago Fire Department is now waiting for preliminary results from the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office which would tell them if Bucio sustained an injury that could have caused him to lose consciousness or if he may have suffered from a medical problem before he went under the boat, a source said.The incident happened after both divers had been in the water for a while looking for the missing boater."They were searching for a person or persons in the water. An order was given to switch out divers to bring the second team in, give them a break. At that time they were coming towards the boat, his partner turned around and he was missing, that quick," said Jose Santiago, the CFD fire commissioner, at a Tuesday news conference.As part of an investigation, Bucio's equipment is being analyzed, his air pressure tank is being checked and everyone who had contact with him before and during the incident is being interviewed, according to a source."Talking to the diver, he was face-to-face with him, he was looking at him, turned around, went back to talk to him, and he was gone," Santiago also said in that Tuesday news conference.Tuesday night, the Ferris wheel at Navy Pier was lit up in honor of Bucio. In the Garfield Ridge neighborhood where he lived, red ribbons were wrapped around utility poles in his memory.Colleagues remembered Bucio, a former lifeguard for the Chicago Park District, as an excellent swimmer, diver, athlete and team player who pushed others to be their bestBucio is a father of two who was one of ten children, two of whom currently serve the city. His brother is a Chicago firefighter and his sister is a Chicago police officer.The search for Lopez, the missing boater, is now a recovery mission.Lopez and two other friends had taken a boat for a ride downtown. As they were returning home in the river's South Branch, a larger boat went past and created a wake which caused their boat to jump, knocking Lopez off the boat, said one Lopez's friends on the boat.Lopez, who was engaged to be married, came to Chicago in November to work construction.His fiancee and three boys, ages 7, 4, and 9 months, are in Aguascalientes, Mexico.Once his body is found, they will send him to Mexico for burial.

Labour has demanded the Tory government 'come clean' about dinners attended by super-rich donors and senior ministers.
The Conservative party last published details of meetings with the exclusive ‘Leader's Group' of high-value donors in December 2016, despite promising to disclose them every quarter.
Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jon Trickett has written to Tory chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin, urging the party to “come clean” and publish full details of the meetings immediately.
The exclusive group of wealthy party backers is responsible for more than half of the £6.2 million donations to the party since the 2016 General Election.
And they have given the party £65 million between them since they came to power.
Only donors with the deepest pockets had access to the elite group, open to those who donate at least £50,000 to the Conservative Party.
(Image: Getty Images)
According to the Party's website The Leader's Group “is the premier supporter Group of the Conservative Party. Members are invited to join Theresa May and other senior figures from the Conservative Party at dinners, post-PMQ lunches, drinks receptions, election result events and important campaign launches.”
Following the ‘cash for access' scandal in 2012, then-Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to publish quarterly details of “any meals attended by major donors, whether they take place at Downing Street, Chequers or any official residence.”
The last publication of such events was in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Mr Trickett said: “Access to power should not be about how big your wallet is. A functioning democracy is not one that allows the super-rich to buy influence in the governing Party without any transparency.
“By failing to provide details of these meetings, Theresa May is breaking her own Party's promise to be more transparent about the influence their super-rich donors have within their Party.”
Theresa May has previously called on political parties to wean themselves off their reliance on high value donors.

In a House of Commons speech in 2007, she said: “It has long been the position of the Conservative party that in order to restore public trust we must remove the dependency of the political parties on all large donors, regardless of whether they are individuals, businesses or trade unions.”
And in her conference speech in October last year, she promised: “The Government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the rich and powerful, but by the interests of ordinary, working class people.”
A Conservative Party spokesperson said: "All donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law."

A key extension on the Metrobus route to join up the new bus network with Bristol Parkway station has been left off the map – because the buses can't reach the station itself.
Bristol Live revealed the buses could not physically access the Metrobus stops which were constructed at the back of Parkway station on Hunts Ground Road, and that the council, Network Rail, GWR and Metrobus were trying to sort out the mess.
Now, the new map for the three Metrobus routes which should all be up and running by the end of 2018 despite ongoing delays, has been produced – and the little spur off to Bristol Parkway is not on the map at all.
That is because work isn't even expected to start on sorting out the widening of the road to ‘update the station access' until the end of 2018, so it won't be ready for when the M3 Metrobus route which connects Emersons Green to the city centre.
And nor will it be ready for when the longest Metrobus route, the M1, connects Cribbs Causeway to Hengrove in South Bristol, with a planned stop on the way at Bristol Parkway.
This week, a spokesperson for Metrobus explained that the problems first revealed by Bristol Live in early December still had not been sorted.
“Parkway Station is constrained site,” she said.
“MetroBus will be a new user of the site, alongside existing bus services, taxis and minicabs, private cars, cyclists and pedestrians.
“Currently, the Parkway site can only accommodate buses arriving and departing through the front entrance.
“GWR and Network Rail are developing plans to update the station access and the bus terminal to allow MetroBus vehicles to use both the front and rear access to the station.
“This work is expected to start in late 2018,” she added.
The M3 Emersons Green to the city centre route is the only Metrobus route to have a confirmed start date – it will begin at the end of May.
The M2 route from Long Ashton park and ride to Temple Meads and the city centre was due to begin in spring, but Bristol Live revealed earlier this month that problems with the guided busway section of the route around Ashton Vale and Ashton Gate were causing delays and although Metrobus said it ‘expected' the M2 route to open by the end of 2018, they would not confirm this would happen.
The M1 route, which includes a spur to Bristol Parkway, is due to open at some point in 2018, and that is still on track to happen – apart from the Parkway spur.
At Greenwich Theatre we have spent the last decade striving to make our venue as accessible as a local cinema. For a long time, theatre has been seen by many as the pastime of the privileged or as the expensive birthday treat that comes around once a year but at Greenwich we fight against that view with every programming choice, every pricing decision, even with the decisions that we make about the signs around the building.
Often the reason for those limiting perceptions of what theatre is all about come either from the prohibitive prices charged by some theatres, or by an expectation that a trip to the theatre will be somehow “difficult”.
Whether that sense of difficulty comes from a cultural preconception shared by families and communities, or from the experience or lack of experience that potential audiences had when they were young, cinema, music or a night in front of the TV can just seem like safer options for entertainment.
Recently the BBC launched a new TV spin-off to Front Row, their flagship radio arts programme.
That was an exciting moment for us, an opportunity to see theatre and television more closely aligned, a chance to reach wider audiences with interesting features and analysis about what goes on at the theatre.
Ultimately, it offered a chance for the BBC to share the enthusiasm and knowledge of carefully selected presenters, spreading the true excitement that can come from a trip to the theatre.
However, the new presenters (Giles Coren, Nikki Bedi and Amol Rajan) gave an interview to the Radio Times that sparked consternation throughout the industry. Among other comments, Bedi said she preferred cinema to theatre and didn't like sitting through plays without intervals.
Rajan rarely gets to an arts event because of his young baby, and Coren said he found theatre stressful because he worries that the actors will forget their lines.
I am not naïve about the nature of the relationship that exists between the media and the theatre.
It is not the role of the BBC to advertise the theatre for us, but it seems unlikely that the corporation would ever hire someone to front Match Of The Day who didn't really like football and worried that the players might fall over, or a new host for Masterchef who only ate beans on toast because of the challenges of catering for a large family.
Arts criticism has to come from those with some kind of knowledge of the industry, and a desire to share their enthusiasm for the arts.
Reading that interview would put any non-theatregoer off attending a play at their local theatre without any engagement in what the experience on offer might actually be like, and the worry is that the same dismissive view will translate to the show itself.
One of the most important projects that we participate in at Greenwich Theatre is the Shakespeare Schools Festival.
Every year, pupils from up to 20 primary and secondary schools spend time in their classroom working on staging Shakespeare's plays before transferring their performances to Greenwich Theatre.
Many of the participants have never been to a theatre before and the transformation in their understanding of what theatre is and can be is amazing.
Maybe Coren, Rajan and Bedi should join one of the primary school classes this year, and rather than dismissing something of which they have little experience and apparently even less interest, they could discover the wonder that theatre can offer to everyone.

Dr Tijion Esho has managed to rack up thousands of followers on Instagram, thanks to his viral beautification videos.
With previous celebrity clients like Charlotte Crosby - and others including Jess Wright and Jess Impiazzi all visiting the cosmetic doctor for different reasons, it's no wonder Dr Esho apparently gets over 150 requests for lip consultations each WEEK.

Obamacare Is First Item On Congress' Chopping Block

Congress is back in session on Tuesday, and leaders of both houses say their first order of business will be to repeal Obamacare.
If they do that, it will be a slap in the face to President Barack Obama just three weeks before he leaves the White House. The Affordable Care is the outgoing president's signature achievement, marked by an elaborate signing ceremony in March 2010 at the White House, with lofty speeches from the vice president and Obama himself.
"Today, after almost a century of trying, today after over a year of debate, today, after all the votes have been tallied, health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America," Obama said that day, to long applause from the assembled crowd.
And Joe Biden famously leaned over to remind the president that it was "a big ***ing deal."
But Republicans have been vowing to repeal the law since the day it passed, and they'll soon have a sympathetic president in the White House to sign whatever bill they send him.
"We will repeal the disaster known as Obamacare and create new health care, all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family," President-elect Donald Trump vowed last month in Orlando.
That new health care plan hasn't been fleshed out yet by Trump or his allies in Congress. So they say they'll vote to get rid of Obamacare, but delay its demise until they come up with a replacement that will cover the millions of people who have insurance thanks to the law.
But insurance companies and health care analysts are worried.
"I don't see how you talk to any [insurance] carrier and give them any desire to hang around to see what they replace it with," says Dr. Kavita Patel, an internist at Johns Hopkins University Hospital and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Why would you stick around for that?"
Patel worked in the White House and helped create the Affordable Care Act. But she's not alone in her concern.
Last month the health insurance trade group America's Health Insurance Plans sent a letter to lawmakers asking them to keep in place many of the financial incentives that are central to the law — including subsidies for patients to help them buy insurance and cover copayments, and a provision that eliminates some taxes on insurers.
The American Academy of Actuaries also warned in its own letter that a repeal of the ACA without replacing it would be dangerous to the long-term health of the insurance market.
Still, Republicans appear determined to move ahead with the vote as soon as this week.
Some history:
Democrats rammed the Affordable Care Act through Congress in 2010 with no Republican support.
It was a huge, complicated law and, like most legislation, it was flawed. Over the subsequent six years, Republicans, who were angry at the way the Affordable Care Act was passed, refused to cooperate in any actions that would be seen as helping it succeed. Instead, they promised in speeches and television interviews to repeal it entirely. In fact, the House has voted more than 60 times over the years to do just that.

"There's no getting around the fact that lots of Republicans campaigned hard against the ACA and a lot of them won, including the person at the top of the ticket," says James Capretta, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
But even with control of both chambers of Congress and with Trump in the White House, Republicans can't simply repeal Obamacare. They would need the help of at least a handful of Democrats to overcome a filibuster.
Democrats can't, however, filibuster budget bills. So Republican leaders have decided to defund Obamacare, eliminating the tax penalties for those who don't buy insurance and the subsidies to help people pay their premiums. Essentially, that guts the law's main elements.
The problem for Republicans is that today, an estimated 20 million people get their insurance through Obamacare. About 10 million buy policies through the exchanges set up by state and federal governments, and most of those patients get subsidies to help pay the premiums.
And millions more are covered because the law allows states to expand the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.
So people who had pre-existing conditions that shut them out of the insurance market before the ACA passed, or people who had reached insurer-imposed lifetime benefit limits, generally like the law.
But, then there are people like Will Denecke, who is mad because his insurance costs have gone up since Obamacare passed. Before the law was enacted, he spent about $340 a month on health insurance.
"Incredibly, we got a notice from my health care company, Moda, which has been having financial problems, that my premium was going up to $930," he said last October.
He's a self-employed urban planning consultant in Portland, Ore., and, unlike most people in Obamacare, he makes too much money to qualify for government subsidies.
"I've had health insurance my whole life, but it's just offensive in principle to think of spending $1,000 a month on health care insurance when there is a good chance I won't need it," he said.
He was considering just letting his coverage lapse.
And, on the other side, you've got people like Leigh Kvetko of Dallas. She takes 10 medications every day because she's had two organ transplant procedures, and the drugs are part of her daily regimen to survive. After Obamacare passed, she was able quit her job at a big company and start a business with her husband, because she could finally get individual insurance.
"This particular plan, the fact that they cannot discriminate against me because of how I was born, was a lifesaver, literally," she says.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told the Washington Times last month that consumers needn't worry. "We can assure the American public that the plan they're in right now, the Obamacare plans, will not end on Jan. 20, that we're going to be prepared and ready with new options tailored for them," he said.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Just a few years ago, millennials surpassed Generation Xers to become the largest cohort in the United States workforce, according to PEW research. As a result, more and more young people are assuming positions of management.
Being managed by someone younger can feel uncomfortable.
I have to admit, I get into the habit of comparing myself to other people. Those who are younger than us who have advanced further professionally can make us feel inadequate or resentful.
At one of the startups where I worked, one co-founder was a decade younger than me. At first I felt awkward with the heavy slate of marketing, sales and social media duties she assigned me. It wasn't too long, though, before we settled into a groove and formed a strong working relationship.
Creating a bond with a younger manager can have significant positive effects on your own career. Here's how you should manage it.
Identify skills that helped your boss advance and develop them in yourself.
Even innovative businesses will adhere to rules of thumb. One rule of thumb many business leaders believe, rightly or wrongly, is that experience is valuable in and of itself. If your manager is younger than you, it means she probably had to overcome stereotypes and false assessments to get there.
Rather than assume your manager is a young punk who had a managerial role handed to her, work on identifying the skills that helped your boss to succeed. By developing the same skills within yourself, you'll be more likely to enter a managerial role as well.
To get started, consider asking your manager point blank to identify the skills that she thinks were most useful in propelling her career forward. Once identified, make it clear that it's a goal to develop those same skills within yourself. A good manager will take this conversation as a sign that you are a driven professional.
Alternatively, you could have a conversation with the person who decided to promote your manager in the first place. As long as you position your question to ensure that it sounds like it's coming from a good place, the senior manager should have no problem sharing this information with you.

Think of your relationship as a partnership.
Your manager is not your parent or your babysitter. If it feels as though your manager is overbearing, have a conversation with her about it. Otherwise, you should treat the relationship you have with your manager as a partnership.
Chances are you are both being evaluated on the same or similar metrics. If you fail, your manager fails, and if your manager fails, you fail. By changing your perspective on this important professional relationship, you may find working with a manager who is younger than you to be more comfortable.
Most managers simply want to ensure that whatever they're working on is completed in the best way possible. They'll be happy to work with employees who are collaborative, open to new ideas and motivated to get the job done.
In return, a manager who is satisfied with your work can make it more likely that you will also find yourself in a management role someday. If nothing else, you can consider leaving your current company and listing your current manager as a reference if you are able to develop a strong relationship.

Trade experience for new ideas.
Both you and your manager have important knowledge that can be made more valuable when put together. You probably have accumulated wisdom from on the job experience, and your manager might have a fresh perspective or innovative new ideas.
Together wisdom and innovation can form a valuable pair that propels both you and your manager to success.
Make sure you make it clear that you are open to new perspectives and new ideas, and offer your experience when appropriate to guide your manager to making smarter choices.

Encourage open feedback in both directions.
Feedback is a critical component of professional growth. So much so that companies like Goldman Sachs are overhauling their feedback processes to boost employee performance. As a younger manager, she may feel anxious or conflicted about providing you with honest feedback. Instead, “manage up” and invite your manager to provide you with honest feedback.
In doing so, you will also set expectations that your manager should invite candidate feedback from you as well. By creating open dialogue between you and your manager, you'll accelerate your professional learning curve and avoid passive aggressive moments.

Though your manager may be younger than you, she earned the privilege of managing a team for a reason. As an ambitious professional, it's your job to understand why your manager earned that role and to begin cultivating the same skills within yourself.
Instead of feeling resentful, partner with your manager to share feedback and wisdom as you both work to achieve success.
By committing yourself to professional self-improvement, you may soon find yourself managing your own team of people who are older than you.

Virat and Anushka tied the knot in a traditional Hindu ceremony in a private ceremony in Italy's Tuscany. Only relatives and very close friends were in attendance.
Speculation about getting married was rife ever since the news surfaced that Virat asked the BCCI for a break in December. Last week, Anushka was spotted at the Mumbai airport along with her family.
The gorgeous film star was seen getting off her car at the airport and was immediately surrounded by reporters who wanted to quiz her about the trip. Anushka chose to remain tight-lipped and walked straight into the airport without answering questions. Her brother Karnesh, father Ajay Kumar Sharma and mother Ashima too made their way through the crowd that had gathered outside the airport.
Now that rumours and speculation have been put to rest, it is reported that the couple will spend New Year's Eve in South Africa where Virat will join his teammates for a three-Test series starting January 5. Before that, they will host a couple of reception parties, in Delhi on December 21 and Mumbai on December 26.
Flynn's Departure Signals Upheaval Inside National Security Council
The resignation of White House national security adviser Michael Flynn could have implications for the National Security Council. Flynn resigned Monday night after reports he misled the vice president-elect about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
Twenty-five days - that's how long Michael Flynn lasted as national security adviser. New details are emerging today about his ouster. He now admits that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. At issue is whether he promised that the U.S. would ease sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:
White House Spokesman Sean Spicer said today President Trump asked for Flynn's resignation and got it.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
SEAN SPICER: We got to a point not based on a legal issue but based on a trust issue where the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.
MCEVERS: Flynn's departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the National Security Council. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports on the upheaval inside the NSC and what's not getting done with all of Washington distracted.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Here's one way of looking at Flynn's departure. Maybe not much will change.
PHILIP GORDON: To be honest, even before Flynn's resignation, was scene at the NSC was fairly chaotic.
KELLY: That's Philip Gordon, a veteran of both the Obama and Clinton National Security Councils. He points to reports of dysfunction. Still, he says the national security adviser plays an essential role in briefing the president every day. Gordon says when the job is not filled or not filled well, you get trouble.
GORDON: If you just think about the inbox of the president today on Iran and Ukraine and the South China Sea and North Korean tests and Egypt and Yemen and Afghanistan and NAFTA and Islamic State strategy and safe zones in Syria, I mean you could go - the volume that goes across the national security adviser's desk is extraordinary. And every one of those issues is extraordinarily complicated and fraught with risk.
KELLY: Want an urgent example of what could go wrong without a steady national security adviser at the helm? Phil Gordon says look at tomorrow. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House. Sure, Gordon says Trump has other advisers to help him prep, but Trump will not benefit from the detailed and careful process that Gordon says is the signature of the NSC.
GORDON: And I can guarantee you that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be more prepared for the meeting than President Trump. You know, that leads to U.S. foreign policy mistakes.
KELLY: We should note there is an acting national security adviser in place. That's retired General Keith Kellogg. And Fran Townsend, veteran of George W. Bush's National Security Council, says it's nonsense to think that Flynn's absence will automatically lead the whole enterprise to go off the rails.
FRAN TOWNSEND: The business of the country continues to get done. It doesn't stop because one person walks out the door.
KELLY: Townsend served as President Bush's homeland security adviser. She says the timing of Flynn's resignation is unfortunate - just three weeks in. But she argues the palace intrigue won't have a serious impact.
TOWNSEND: This is Washington's favorite parlor game, right? I think we on the outside spend a lot more time on this sort of nonsense than you do when you have the nation's business that you're responsible for. I mean I just don't think the people - the substantive people in the White House have the luxury of the parlor game. They just don't.
KELLY: Townsend predicts calmer waters ahead for the Trump White House. Adam Schiff does not. He's the California congressman who's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff believes the Russia trail does not end with Michael Flynn, that it leads deeper and higher in the White House. Schiff says he's troubled in particular by this question.
ADAM SCHIFF: Was Flynn acting at the president's behest? Was he acting with the president's knowledge?
KELLY: Because if that were true...
SCHIFF: Then you have the president of the United States, the prospect of the president of the United States lying to the public about contacts with one of the principal threats to the country, that being Russia. That's about as serious as it gets in the national security realm.
KELLY: Trump Spokesman Sean Spicer categorically denied this charge today, saying the president did not direct Flynn to talk about sanctions. That's a month and a day after Spicer categorically denied that Michael Flynn ever discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador. Mary Louise Kelly, NPR News, Washington.

Texas Governor Lays Out School Safety Plan, After 10 Died In Santa Fe Shooting
Citing a need to make "our schools and our state a safer place," Texas Gov. Greg Abbott unveiled a slate of policy and legislative changes on Wednesday that range from boosting security at schools to doing more to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
Abbott spoke about "school hardening strategies" such as reducing entries and exits at schools — and "active shooter alarm systems" that can be easily distinguished from a fire alarm. That approach, he said, would help students and staff respond appropriately — and avoid sending students into hallways where they might be targeted by an active shooter.
The governor also said state law should be changed to force courts to report a mental health adjudication that someone is "mentally unfit to have a gun" more quickly. The law should tighten that deadline to 48 hours rather than the current 30 days, Abbott said.
Abbott's plan calls for adding more school marshals — teachers who are licensed to carry firearms and go through training — as well as increasing the number of marshals per campus.
Noting that social media often contains clues of shooters' intentions before they act, Abbott said he wants to expand a program that has been tested in West Texas, which "uses mental health screenings to identify students at risk of committing violence," Abbott said. Called the Telemedicine Wellness, Intervention, Triage, and Referral (or TWITR) Project, the approach has been led by Texas Tech University.

Another initiative seeks to enhance the presence of local police at schools, something Abbott said could be accomplished by adding schools to their regular patrols and "allowing officers to use campus facilities for routine breaks, or for them to have a room located at that school, where than can fill out their reports."
Abbott said he also wants to change Texas law to promote responsible gun ownership – and to give officials more authority to seize guns.
The governor said he will ask the state legislature to consider a law "that would allow law enforcement, a family member, a school employee or a district attorney to file a petition in court seeking the removal of firearms from a person proven to be dangerous to himself or to others."
Another proposal calls for requiring gun owners to report when their weapons are lost or stolen.
Abbott said the new ideas are part of the Governor's School and Firearm Safety Plan – a list of 40 recommendations for making communities safer. He detailed his new school-safety plan in an event held at the Dallas Independent School District's administration building Wednesday morning.
When asked if any elements of his proposal would be mandatory, Abbott said, "A lot of these are things the state will be doing," citing work on social media assessment programs. He added that "there is no resistance" from schools over adding safety measures.
As for paying for the changes, he said his plan includes more than $100 million in grants, matching funds, and other money.
Abbott spoke one day after he visited Santa Fe High School on its first day of classes since the May 18 shooting that killed 10 people.
"We want action to prevent another shooting" like Santa Fe, Abbott said.
To improve the ability to alert schools and officials to potential risks, Abbott said the state will expand crime stopper programs and make it easier for students to report possible threats — something he said could be helped by a new app called iWatchTX, which the governor said will be activated next month.
Leading up to today's announcement, Abbott hosted three days of roundtable talks in Austin, meeting with survivors, friends and loved ones from recent shootings. He said he had met with more than 100 victims and their relatives, and that he had been "proud and inspired" by the students at Santa Fe.
A key demand he heard at the meetings, Abbott said, was "for greater law enforcement presence at schools."
Since Abbott was sworn in as governor in 2015, Texas has suffered two horrible shootings — this month at Santa Fe High and, last November, at the Sutherland Springs Baptist Church, where 26 people were killed in the small town east of San Antonio.
And in 2016, a gunman shot and killed five police officers during a protest against police shootings of black men.
When he visited Santa Fe High after the shooting, Abbott said,"It's impossible to describe the magnitude of the evil of someone who would attack innocent children in a school, a place of learning where parents should be able to send their children without fear for their child's safety."
As leaders often do after such an event, the governor asked for "prayers and support" for loved ones affected by the shooting. He also said, "We need to do more than just pray for the victims and their families. It's in Texas that we take action, to step up and make sure this tragedy is never repeated."

Later, Katie sits up and poses naked for the camera in full view of passers by - who merely just wanted a nice day out at the beach.
The former glamour model clearly doesn't mind about the attention however, as she's seen waving and shouting while making a poor attempt at hiding her boobs with one hand.
It's not all fun and games for Katie in tonight's episode of My Crazy Life however.
She also comes face to face with DJ Tom Zanetti - who she was accused of having an affair with when they worked on a song together earlier this year.

Tom decided to drop the track they had been working on after he was linked to her.
And as she confronts him, Tom threatens to show some potentially damaging evidence about their relationship to her husband Kieran Hayler.
During the argument, Katie fumes: “We meet again since Miami.
"Obviously I know now the track's not going to go ahead.
"Yet again my dreams were shattered, 'cause everything I do gets shattered.”

With three matches in the space of eight days heralding the start of the new season for Bristol Rovers, the spotlight has rather fallen away from transfers.
But as Rovers slipped to a galling 4-1 defeat to Peterborough on Saturday, a lot of talk after the match was asking who Rovers could bring in to strengthen the squad before the transfer window slams shut on August 31.
With over two weeks to go until clubs have to conclude their wheeling and dealing, there is still plenty of time for Rovers to get a few more deals over the line.
(Image: Robbie Stephenson/JMP)
As far back as April, Darrell Clarke made it clear he wanted to overhaul his squad this summer, announcing his plans to bring in 10 or 11 new players at the club before the window closes.
With six signings made by the time the team returned from their warm weather training in Portugal, Clarke appeared happy with his work in the transfer market up to that point.
He told the Post following the Forest Green Rovers friendly on July 22 exactly what type of players he was targeting for the remaining four signings - a left footed centre back, a defensive midfielder, a left winger and a striker.
The double signing of Dom Telford and Ryan Sweeney the day before the new season - both on loan from Stoke City - ticked off the requirement for a centre-back and striker, leaving just the two midfield positions outstanding.
With new signing Liam Sercombe and old hands Chris Lines, Ollie Clarke and Stuart Sinclair all jostling for central midfield roles, the need for a defensive midfielder is perhaps hard to understand.
But watching Rovers on Saturday against the Posh, the need was more apparent. Although the main reason Rovers were so soundly beaten came down to consistent basic errors, a lack of a midfield shield for the back four was also to blame.
Sercombe looks a great signing and clearly has an eye for goal, his effort against Cambridge will live long in the memory, while he tested Posh keeper Jonathan Bond from long distance on Saturday too. But although he offers plenty going forward, Rovers are still in need of a deep lying ball playing central midfielder. Someone who can break up the play and give simple balls to get Rovers moving back up the pitch.
It may sound a simple job but there aren't many who can play the role with real panache and that perhaps explains why Clarke has not yet filled the position with a new recruit.
As for the left winger role, Rovers are clearly lacking some width in their current squad. It is undoubtedly a talented squad Clarke has assembled this season, the best he's had since joining the club, but it does lack the sort of players who hug the touchline and can whip balls into the box.
So far this season, Clarke has used Sinclair wide on the left, with Byron Moore coming on from the bench. Both players have many talents, but neither are natural wingers. Bringing in a winger would give Rovers far more options going forward than just the long diagonal balls they seemed insistent on using against Peterborough.
Aside from the two positions outlined above, Rovers look set to have a pretty quiet end to the transfer window as Clarke tied up his most important pieces of business - signing two goalkeeepers, getting Sweeney back and bringing in a striker - before a ball was kicked in the league.
But if Rovers put in more performances similar to the Peterborough defeat, Clarke may be tempted to try and bring in a few more signings before the hard slog of the new season takes hold in the autumn.

Parents have branded a school "medieval" after it told them to send their children in SICK - after being criticised for poor attendance.
Kids at The Bishop of Hereford's Bluecoat School may find themselves coughing and spluttering at their desks, if mums and dads follow the controversial request.
A letter sent to parents says "if they are able to get out of bed, then we would rather they were in school"
It comes after the school was criticised in its last Ofsted inspection which revealed it had a high absence record.

Figures show it had an attendance rate of 94.7 per cent - compared with the national average of 96 per cent.
The school also has a persistent absence rate - pupils missing at least 19 days a year - of 13.8 per cent, compared to a national average of 13.1.
In a bid to improve its attendance figures, the school wrote to parents urging them to send their children into class if they could "get out of bed".
The letter written to parent this week, said: "Attendance of our students was an area of concern at our Ofsted inspection last year.
"If your child is absent from the school for more than two days, then we would urge you to seek medical attention.
"However, if you are able to get out of bed, then we would rather they were in school.
"If you have concerns, please discuss this with your child's learning mentor as there may be an option to work in the learning hub, which is a quieter environment."
(Image: Hereford Times / SWNS.com)
The school, which caters for 1,099 children aged 11-16, was told it 'requires improvement' by Ofsted last February.
Parents expressed anger at the letter, saying the school was putting children's health at risk by forcing them to attend class.
One dad, who did not want to be named, said: "When I received the letter saying my son should go to school ill I was horrified.
"They were basically saying they'd teach ill kids in some kind of sick class. How on earth are kids going to learn if they've got a bug?
"Surely they're more likely to stay ill for longer that be forced to sit in a classroom with a bunch of other sick kids.
"What were they going to do, give kids sick buckets under their desks? It's medieval."
Another mum, whose two daughters attend the school, added: "The school is so desperate not to get another bad Ofsted report they are prepared to endanger the health of pupils.
"It's disgusting. I bet none of the teachers would come into school if they were ill. A cold is sometimes enough to see a teacher to stay off.
"They need to tackle other problems in the school like bullying."
Following the backlash, the school has apologised to parents.
(Image: Hereford Times / SWNS.com)
A school spokesperson said: "Following last year's Ofsted inspection, we are working in partnership with parents and carers to ensure excellent attendance.
"We have seen an increase of 0.4 per cent attendance compared to the first term of 2016/17, which shows that parents/carers and students are also supporting this aim.
"However, Bishop's school has recently experienced unprecedented outbreaks of flu and sickness which has had a significant impact on the attendance of both students and staff.
"We recently sent a letter to all parents and carers praising students for their excellent attendance in the autumn term, and to reinforce our attendance expectations.
"We will always trust in parent/carer discretion when deciding whether a child is fit to return to school, and we apologise that our letter did not communicate this effectively.
"If parents and carers are in doubt as to whether their child is ready to return to school following flu or diarrhoea and vomiting, we advise them to discuss with our staff in confidence."

When you were small, did you ever mix cocoa powder into your instant custard? Chocolate custard was a sensual affair.
It might have seen revelatory at the time, but really, it was obvious – chocolate usually improves things. Especially hot things poured onto fluffy spongecake.
All this custard pondering... it makes you think: why haven't we done this to crumpets? What have we been doing? Where have we been?
Why have we waited until now to make chocolate crumpets?
(Photo: Instagram / knead_baking)
Thank goodness for Knead Baking in London. There, chocolate crumpets are a reality. The bakery has been doing them sometime, actually, but people are actually beginning to notice now.
We've got BBC Good Food to thank to spotting the elegant – and nutritious – breakfast items. Apparently they're best topped with maple butter, or peanut butter, or, yes, maybe some chocolate peanut butter. Who knows. We're living outside breakfast boundaries these days.
Chocolate crumpets suddenly become a thing due to Valentine's Day. The term just doesn't just mean topping savoury crumpets with Nutella any more.
(Photo: Instagram / knead_baking)
Although some people have announced reservations over the sweet crumpets, most people appear to appreciate the proposition of a 70 per cent chocolate tea time snack with a gooey centre. The chocolate orange ones sound good.
Some say the treats are a bit like "light brownies".
Knead Bakery's invention is sold from the shop in London, and Selfridge's Food Hall. So yes, they're a bit London right now, but we imagine they'll be made available elsewhere soon. Let's hope so.
COLUMBUS, Ga — Two people are recovering in the hospital after police confirm they were injured during a shooting at the Elizabeth Canty Apartments Monday night.

The conditions and identities of the victims have also not been released.
WRBL has put in a call to the Columbus Police Department for an update in this case.
This is a developing story. Stay with WRBL News 3 for updates.

The Food and Drug Administration began keeping records on antibiotic use in livestock animals in 2009. For the first time since then, the agency says antibiotic usage dropped.
Sales of medically important antibacterials for livestock and poultry fell by ten percent in 2016. The decline actually took place ahead of new antibiotic usage requirements that became law in January. As of 2017, farmers have to have veterinary oversight to give antibiotics to livestock animals. The drugs can no longer be sold for growth promotion. Tetracyclines made up 70 percent of all medically-important antibiotics sold last year, but their usage dropped by 15 percent from the previous year. Opponents of on-farm antibiotic use look at this as a win.
The Natural Resources Defense Council points out that the decline follows a series of commitments from the food industry to cut back on antibiotic use. A senior attorney for the NRDC says the progress is heavily influenced by the changes already made in the chicken industry, but also says the beef and pork industries are lagging behind.
India is not one of the four manufacturing sites for the Jeep Compass but also the export base for all right-hand drive models.
New Delhi: Mark T. Allen, director of Jeep's famed design studio, had not even in his wildest dreams thought about launching Jeep in India.
That was perhaps because Indians weren't known to do a lot of off-roading, something the iconic Jeep is known for.
So, five years ago, when he and his team of designers were tasked with designing the Jeep Compass, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) for emerging markets, they had no clue that India would end up not just as one of the four manufacturing sites for the Compass, but as the export base for all right-hand drive models.
“We did not know anything about it. Just five years ago, every Jeep that we made was made in the US,” Allen said in an interview.
Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ltd and an out-and-out automobiles man, may have had something to do with it, according to Allen.
“There is a real warm relationship between Mr Ratan Tata and our chairman (Fiat Chrysler chairman Sergio Marchionne). That's probably how it happened. That's probably the genesis of how we ended up by doing this car in India.”
The Jeep Compass is being manufactured at Ranjangaon near Pune, at a facility jointly owned by Tata Motors Ltd and Fiat India.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV owns brands including Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Jeep.
Allen's colleague and managing director of Fiat Chrysler's India operations, Kevin Flynn, has a more mundane explanation to the firm's India manufacturing move.
“The idea of building a Jeep in India was something that the company had already embarked on before I came to India two and a half years ago, and undoubtedly the influence of Mike Manley and his role as global head of Jeep and RAM Trucks...his engagement with India was immense,” Flynn said.
Credited with the success of the Jeep brand, which is growing faster than other group brands such as Fiat or Alfa Romeo globally, Mike Manley is widely seen as the successor to Marchionne. India, touted to become the world's third largest passenger vehicle market in a decade, is a crucial frontier for Manley before he assumes a larger role at the group.
“So, he could see the potential. And as part of the global goal, India could play a strategic role, he believed,” Flynn said.
The move to set up an export hub in India and that too for Jeep models (some such as Renegade are expected in 2018) signals Fiat's renewed interest in the Indian market, where it has met with little success despite a long association. After having sold its popular models such as the Uno and Fiat 1100—or Fiat Padmini—through a licensing agreement with Premier Automobile Ltd, Fiat set up its Indian subsidiary in 1997. In 2006, it signed an agreement with Tata Motors Ltd to jointly manufacture and sell cars in India. However, in 2012, it decided to call off the alliance and embarked on a solo journey.
The immediate requirement is not to make an Indian car for export but to make a global car in India for export and the local market, Flynn said.
“We will be exporting to very developed markets with very discerning clientele... How do we ensure global integrity so that wherever this car goes, it is the same car, which will deliver us a world-class car on the Indian roads, and we have never lost sight of those objectives,” Flynn said.
The process to achieve those objectives started four years ago. Back in May 2013, Mint reported that senior officials of the Fiat Group met component vendors to explore the possibility of setting up a manufacturing base in the country. The vendors were told that the Turin-based Fiat was looking to reinforce its manufacturing facilities for its Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands.
Such deliberations are required. High-end cars require expensive and top notch technologies such as hot-stamping and laser welding. All of that is now being done in India, Flynn claimed.
But, what about Fiat's inglorious past in the country—a perception of good automobiles backed by a poor sales and an even worse service network?
“There is this perception you can't get past. I have to address it,” Flynn said, claiming that he could provide 96% of the parts that go into a Fiat off the shelf. And that he could send a car to any part of the country in 72 hours.
To strengthen its service network, Fiat will also soon launch Mopar, an official seller of parts for Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat vehicles.
Flynn expects Jeep to do well in India, and points to the country's long-standing affection for the Willy's Jeep. “If Willy's Jeep was your telephone, your next Jeep is a smartphone yet with same consistencies, capabilities and other attributes.”
And it may cost a bit more too. The Compass is expected to be priced between Rs17 lakh and Rs25 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).
Kilauea's Fast-Moving Lava Threatens Another Community, Volcanic Haze Reaches Guam
U.S. Geological Survey YouTube
It has been 27 days since the massive eruption of Kilauea sent lava gushing from cracks, spreading destruction through communities in the southeastern corner of Hawaii's Big Island. And now volcanic haze drifting across 4,000 miles threatens some residents of Guam, according to officials.
The National Weather Service reported volcanic haze produced by the activity of the rumbling volcano has been carried along by strong winds over the Mariana Islands.
"Residents with respiratory health problems should stay indoors and avoid being outdoors when haze is seen," Guam's homeland security office said in a statement. "Mariners and pilots should be aware of lower visibilities caused by this haze."
Although the haze does not contain sulfur dioxide or other toxic chemicals, a NWS official told NPR the particles in the air can still be harmful to people with sensitive respiratory systems. The official added the haze is expected to dissipate by the end of Thursday morning but will likely return as Kilauea continues to erupt.

On the island, conditions have worsened. Each day brings some sort of geologic phenomenon, including laze, blue flames, vog, ash clouds, ballistic blocks, splatter bombs, sky-high lava fountains, ash plumes, and more than 2000 earthquakes.
On Wednesday U.S. Geological Survey officials warned fast-moving lava threatened to tear through more homes in the already ravaged communities of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens. They estimated violent eruptions of molten rock spewing out of a nearby fissure — Fissure 8 — were burning through anything in its path at a rate of 600 yards per hour.
Additionally, a lava fountain rising out of the crack in the Earth was spraying more than 200 feet into the air, and multiple secondary fountains reached 60 feet.
The USGS reported the fiery springs have caused sharp, thin strands of volcanic glass fibers called "Pele's hair" to fall from the sky throughout the Leilani Estates and Pahoa region. The dangerous fibers — named after Hawaiian fire and volcano goddess Pele — are produced when lava splatter droplets cools rapidly in the air and can cause skin and eye irritation similar to volcanic ash.
Officials are urging people to steer clear of tiny and abrasive particles of glass.
Meanwhile, Hawaii County Civil Defense scrambled to get residents out of Kapoho, a neighborhood north of Leilani Estates, before they became trapped by advancing lava.
"You are at risk of being isolated due to possible lava inundation of Beach Road near Four Corners," the USGS warned Wednesday.
Volcanic gas emissions, consisting of sulfuric dioxide also remained "very high" and the weather exacerbated the poor air quality. Wind conditions in the coming days means "vog" — volcanic gas mixed with ash — is expected to spread over the island, according to the USGS.
Hawaii Public Radio reported about 22 fissures have torn open the ground and at least 40 homes have been wrecked since May 3. More than 2,000 acres of land have been smothered by lava and about 200 people are staying in emergency shelters.
The most recent map of lava flows can be found here.
The agency has been updating the public, disseminating vital safety information and responding to questions over Twitter since early May but on Tuesday, officials took some time to respond to an odd query: Jay Furr wanted to know, "Is it safe to roast marshmallows over volcanic vents? Assuming you had a long enough stick, that is? Or would the resulting marshmallows be poisonous?"
"Erm...we're going to have to say no, that's not safe. (Please don't try!)," replied the USGS before delivering a little science. "If the vent is emitting a lot of SO2 or H2S, they would taste BAD. And if you add sulfuric acid (in vog, for example) to sugar, you get a pretty spectacular reaction."
The good sports at the USGS chose not to specify exactly what happens when sulfuric acid and sugar are mixed, but many others on the Internet have and you can see them here.

Nyasa Big Bullets coach Rogers Yasin and his assistant Elijah Kananji will be offered one-year deals, the club's chief executive officer Fleetwood Haiya confirmed yesterday.
This comes after the People's Team announced, last week, that they would retain their coaching panel.
Said Haiya: “It has been agreed that the duration should be one year and as stated earlier on, they will be offered performance-based contracts with specific targets.
“The targets include winning the TNM Super League championship and some cups.”
Yasin yesterday said they have been informed verbally about the one-year deals as well as the targets.
“But we are yet to see the contracts and, therefore, I can only comment after going through it,” he said.
Last season Bullets finished as runners-up in the Super League. They also won the Carlsberg Cup. n

It's July 4th will be independent weather-wise in one way, but very similar to what we've seen the last five days in another.
First, the good news. It will be a partly sunny day with just a chance of thunderstorms. The most likely time frame for any storms is from 1 p.m. until 4 p.m. Wednesday when there's a 30 percent chance.
The evening should be storm-free, meaning fireworks celebrations and outdoor activities are not in any serious danger.
Now, the not so good news.
Yes, the heat wave will be technically over as the actual high temperature is expected to be around 85 degrees. (A heat wave is defined as three straight days with a high temperature of 90 degrees or above.)
But high humidity will make it feel like it's about 10 degrees hotter than the actual temperature with a heat index in the mid-90s. (See image above.)
The heat index is the combination of the actual temperature and humidity.
The highest heat indices will occur in the afternoon and early evening.
A Heat Advisory is in effect until 9 p.m. Wednesday.
Thursday will be similar to July 4th with partly sunny skies and a high in the mid-80s. There's a chance for evening thunderstorms.
Showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain and possible flash flooding are likely Friday morning as a cold front arrives. The high temperature will be in the low-80s.
The passage of the cold front will result in pleasant and more comfortable days on the weekend.
Saturday will be sunny with a high in the mid-70s. Sunday will be sunny with a high around 80.

Two Presidential houses collided today when US leader Donald Trump and his First Lady met their French counterparts.
The President welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte to the White House.
Their meeting in Washington was watched by the world, including body language expert Judi James.
Here's what she had to say about the hand shakes, kisses and embraces...
When Trump and Macron first met there was a classic body language struggle that ended with Macron winning the power-shake and stare-off against the larger, older alpha male.

Since then Macron has displayed several ingratiation techniques, leading to an odd 'father and son' vibe between the two men.
The closeness might not be shared by the two wives, although Trump seems especially keen here to define a very strong entente cordial with Brigitte.
Pic 1. This is Trump in full quasi-paternal mode using his physical bulk and size to overwhelm Macron, hunching over him with his arm around the French leader. Trump's eye gaze misses Macron though who seems to be still intent on stealing power-points here, gazing affectionately while power-patting the older man.

2. This man-hug and kiss involves an awkward horizontal embrace from Trump plus an unsettling blend of intense frowning and over-puckered lips .

3. While all four characters stand to attention on their chalk marks, Trump and Macron use intense postural mirroring on one side while Melania hides her face beneath a huge brimmed hat on the other.

4. This is a very affectionately paternal-looking cheek kiss from Trump with his narrowed eyes and over-pucker suggesting he's lost in the moment and the splayed hand on Macron's back implying closeness.

5. It's shades of the Lion King in this moment as Trump and Macron seem to display their father/son vibe with this odd hand hold. Trump stands solid here but with his right arm bent to hold Macrons hand. The French leader still aims for controlling role though by placing his hand on top in the clasp and seeming to want to lead Trump away.

6. Melania seems to remain in control in this potential embrace and kiss ritual, holding Macrons hand low to create space and doing the old Ab-fab trick of raising and stretching your head to performance air-kiss. Trump has employed a firm-looking double hand grip on Brigitte though as he plants his cheek-kiss.

7. Macron stands in gooseberry mode here as the Trumps and Brigitte enjoy a communal hug. Macrons fig-leaf hand barrier suggests he might be feeling left out here.

8. ( balcony shots) This celebratory act of holding hands and raises them seems to define both what looks like a dynasty plus intense levels of unity an rapport. The men are tactile (although Macrondoes seem to be raising his fingers in an odd 'Bulls horns'shape; the women wear co-ordinating colours and the overall power 'family' imagery might rival anything we've seen on the balcony at Buckingham Palace.

Macron's visit is the first time Trump has hosted a state visit since he took power in January last year.
While the French leader has tried to develop a close relationship with Trump since he took office last May, he has so far seen few tangible results on issues from Iran to climate politics.
Three Major Deals Point To A Maturing, And Global, Music Startup Landscape
Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg via Getty Images
Three deals of acquisitions and investments that were rumored over the past week, and that are all now confirmed, have something in common — none of them involve companies owned by major record labels. All involve technology companies or insurrectionists to entrenched industry leaders. One noted below, Tencent, holds such power in its home country that all three major labels agreed to let it broker their deals in that country. Another, Spotify, has for better and worse come to define the modern era of music listening, helping establish new habits for music fans that have led to a strong new revenue stream for the classic music business (but not yet for Spotify itself).
All point to a music industry both in repair and reconfiguration.
SONGS And Kobalt
SONGS, a successful and scrappy independent music publishing company founded in 2004 by a former hardcore guitarist and Columbia business grad, has been acquired by another outsider-led firm, Kobalt Capital, the acquisition division of Kobalt Music Group. The price tag for SONGS wasn't disclosed, but is reported to be around $160 million.
Matt Pincus, the founder and CEO of SONGS, approached the music publishing business — the administration and exploitation of song compositions and the songwriters behind them, not recorded pieces of music — with a grassroots approach, preferring initially to signing promising artists to extensive contracts over acquiring song catalogs of known quality and revenue. The firm attracted little attention for its first several years from the established music business — no articles in the trade publication Billboard, and only a wedding notice in The New York Times. Several high-profile deals struck in the midst of heavy competition — foremost those involving Lorde, The Weeknd and Diplo, all brokered by founding A&R member and now-departing president Ron Perry, who will soon lead Columbia Records — put the company on the map around 2013.
"That the result of our work is a catalog we created writer by writer and song by song, representing a decade of popular music in all formats — including many of tomorrow's evergreens — is a testament to our approach," Pincus says, in a release on the news. Not long after, it began working with the estate of George Gershwin. (It still maintains its ground-up approach, recently signing the maligned SoundCloud rapper XXXTentacion to a global deal.)
The buyer of SONGS, Kobalt, is another (relatively) new music company emblematic of fundamental shifts and new approaches within an industry long dominated by an entrenched executive class. Its Swedish founder, Willard Ahdritz, founded the company in 2000 intending to take a strict, technological approach to the song business. The company eventually debuted a tool which allows artists, regardless of their stature, to track listening of their work worldwide — to show who is playing which song, where, in real time across 900,000 possible sources of income. It was the first to offer such granular tracking information to anyone willing to pay. (Record labels, other music publishers and label services companies all have similar tools available to their rosters, but those tools' availability and granularity vary.) Along the way to establishing his company, which has seen revenues increase while still operating at a loss, Ahdritz was often antagonistic towards his established competitors.
"It's important to remember that the [major labels] were structured to control distribution and marketing in the old world ruled by radio," he told Billboard two years ago. "Things have changed, and I expect the industry structure will change as well. It has to adapt in order to survive." As Moby, a client of the company, told The New York Times: "Kobalt is more like a tech company than a music company. As a result, no one ever told them to steal from their artists."
Apple Buys Identifier App Shazam
"I'm gonna Shazam it," is something you now hear often, usually right before someone you know starts holding a smartphone aloft, microphone skyward. Shazam's name has long held the coveted also-a-verb status, which it has earned by developing one of the most robust song-identifying technologies in the world. The company was founded in 2002 as a phone call-in service.
Now, in a deal confirmed today, Apple will own that experience. "We are thrilled that Shazam and its talented team will be joining Apple," the company wrote in a statement provided to NPR. "Apple Music and Shazam are a natural fit, sharing a passion for music discovery and delivering great music experiences to our users. We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today's agreement."
The sale, first reported by TechCrunch, is estimated to carry a price tag of $400 million, far less than the $1 billion it was estimated to be worth two years ago. After a shift to advertising, it claimed to have generated a profit for the first time.
Apple will likely use the company's technology to augment Apple Music, its music streaming service and the primary competitor to market leader Spotify. Even back when it was Beats Music, the platform was highly reliant on human curation, employing 100 people to create playlists for it. "Right now, there are only mathematical solutions," Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine told a tech conference in 2013.
Spotify And Tencent
Meanwhile Spotify and Tencent, a leading Chinese media company which also brokers the major labels' fortunes in that country, announced a mutual investment late last week. While details weren't given, the deal was reportedly for 10 percent for each when the news was broken by The Wall Street Journal the week prior.
The partnership is unprecedented in the music streaming space, where more often than not — as was the case with Pandora's acquisition of Rdio — companies purchase each other wholesale. In the case of Spotify and Tencent, the latter could easily afford to purchase Spotify outright. This structure instead would ostensibly allow each to benefit from the other's specialties. Spotify is a market leader outside of China, while Tencent largely holds the keys to enter the country's digital music business.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Just six days into his presidency, Donald Trump was informed his national security adviser had misled his vice president about contacts with Russia. Trump kept his No. 2 in the dark and waited nearly three weeks before ousting the aide, Michael Flynn, citing a slow but steady erosion of trust, White House officials said.
Flynn was interviewed by the FBI about his telephone conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., a sign his ties to Russia had caught the attention of law enforcement officials.
But in the White House's retelling of Flynn's stunning downfall, his error was not that he discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian before the inauguration — a potential violation of a rarely enforced law — but the fact that he denied it for weeks, apparently misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other senior Trump aides about the nature of the conversations. White House officials said they conducted a thorough review of Flynn's interactions, including transcripts of calls secretly recorded by U.S. intelligence officials, but found nothing illegal.
Pence, who had vouched for Flynn in a televised interview, is said to have been angry and deeply frustrated.

“The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable incidents is what led the president to ask General Flynn for his resignation,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday, one day after the president asked Flynn to leave.
Flynn, in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation, said Monday “there were no lines crossed” in his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
The explanation of the episode left many questions unanswered, including why Trump didn't alert Pence to the matter and why Trump allowed Flynn to keep accessing classified information and taking part in the president's discussions with world leaders up until the day he was fired.
White House officials also struggled to explain why Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway had declared the president retained “full confidence” in Flynn just hours before the adviser had to submit his letter of resignation.
Later Tuesday, The New York Times reported that U.S. agencies had intercepted phone calls last year between Russian intelligence officials and members of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team. Current and former U.S. officials who spoke to the Times anonymously said they found no evidence that the Trump campaign was working with the Russians on hacking or other efforts to influence the election.
The White House shakeup, less than one month into Trump's tenure, marked another jarring setback for a new administration already dealing with tensions among top aides and a legal fight over the president's travel ban order. Flynn's firing also heightened questions about the president's friendly posture toward Russia. Democrats called for investigations into Flynn's contacts, and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Congress needed to know whether he had been acting with direction from the president or others.
Trump initially thought Flynn could survive the controversy, according to a person with direct knowledge of the president's views, but a pair of explosive stories in The Washington Post in recent days made the situation untenable. As early as last week, he and aides began making contingency plans for Flynn's dismissal, a senior administration official said. While the president was said to be upset with Flynn, he also expressed anger with other aides for “losing control” of the story and making his young administration look bad.
Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said Pence became aware that he had received “incomplete information” from Flynn only after the first Washington Post report Thursday night. Pence learned about the Justice Department warnings to the White House around the same time.
The officials and others with knowledge of the situation were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity.
Ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration, Pence and other officials insisted publicly that Flynn had not discussed sanctions in his talks with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On Jan. 26, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House counsel Don McGahn to raise concerns about discrepancies between the public accounting and what intelligence officials knew to be true about the contacts based on routine recordings of communications with foreign officials who are in the U.S.
The Justice Department warned the White House that the inconsistencies would leave the president's top national security aide vulnerable to blackmail from Russia, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. The president was informed of the warnings the same day, Spicer said.
Flynn was interviewed by the FBI around the same time, according to a U.S. official who was briefed on the investigation.
It was not immediately known what questions the FBI asked of Flynn or what he told law enforcement officials.
McGahn, along with chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon, also questioned Flynn multiple times in the ensuing weeks, a White House official said. Top aides also reviewed transcripts of Flynn's contacts with the ambassador, according to a person with knowledge of the review process.
At the same time, the official said Trump aides began taking steps to put some distance between the president and Flynn. CIA Director Mike Pompeo and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a top Flynn aide, started taking part in Trump's daily security briefings.
Top Trump advisers quietly met with Vice Admiral Robert Harward last week and spoke with the former Navy SEAL again Monday, the White House official said. Harward is seen as the top contender for the job, though former CIA Director David Petraeus and Kellogg, who has temporarily stepped into the role, are also under consideration.
Spicer said other “questionable incidents” had contributed to Flynn's firing. According to one person with knowledge of the matter, those incidents included Flynn seeking a security clearance for his son during the transition.
At the time, it was Pence who was again put in the position of defending Flynn on television, saying he had not sought a clearance for the retired general's son.
A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition. Spicer said Flynn was not discussing sanctions at the president's behest.
Before he resigned Monday night, Flynn told the investigative news nonprofit affiliated with the website The Daily Caller that he and Kislyak spoke only generally about the Russian diplomats expelled by President Barack Obama as part of the previous administration's response to Moscow's interference in the U.S. presidential election.
“It wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,” Flynn said. “It was basically: ‘Look, I know this happened. We'll review everything.' I never said anything such as, ‘We're going to review sanctions,' or anything like that.”

An adorable family puppy has been heartlessly stolen from a plasterer's van in broad daylight, leaving the owners' three young sons devastated.
The six-month-old French bulldog named Honey was taken from the van while it was parked in the car park of the Premier Inn in Westerleigh Road, Emersons Green, on the morning on Tuesday, January 30.
Honey's owner, father-of-three Melvyn Burns from Stockwood, had left the pup in the van for half an hour while he surveyed some work that needed doing on a nearby building site.
Two other vans parked alongside the Citroen Berlingo were also broken into and the 30-year-old says the dog-nappers also took two drills and a petrol grinder.

The puppy's abduction comes less than a year after the Burns family lost two other dogs due to health problems.
Their 12-year-old staffie Duke lost died of cancer in June 2017 before their previous French bulldog – five-year-old Shivers – had a sudden spinal problem and had to be put down just 10 days later.
Mr Burns says his three sons, aged four, eight and nine, were all attached to Honey and their teachers said they had been sad and withdrawn at school since she was taken.
“We've only had her for four months,” said Melvyn. “I just want her back for my family, me, my kids and my wife.
(Image: (C) James Beck 2018)
“We just want her back and for nothing bad to happen to her.”
Honey is a brown French bulldog, with green eyes and a white underside.
Mr Burns' Facebook appeal to help track down the stolen dog has been shared more than 1,500 times – but as yet to no avail.
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said: “We can confirm we are investigating a van break-in on Tuesday, January 30 between 9.30am and 10.30am in Emersons Green.
“A six-month-old French Bulldog was taken from a Citroen Berlingo van, which was parked in the Premier Inn car park in Westerleigh Road.”
Anyone who was in the area who has information is asked to contact the police quoting reference 5218 022 089.

There are more than 11 million renters in England alone - paying billions to people they've never met in deposits each time they move.
But what happens if - despite your best efforts - they decide you can't have it back at the end of the tenancy?
According to housing laws, most private landlords are required to place all deposits held in a registered tenancy scheme and also give you written proof of this.
But despite these rules, thousands of people each year find themselves turning to charities such as Citizens Advice and Shelter in search of help, after losing their deposit for what they claim was no fault of their own.
To give an example: in 2016, four in 10 students had some or all of their deposits kept by landlords to the tune of £32 million, according to StudentTenant.com.
Across the UK, around 29% of renters lose their deposits every year, a poll by Hillarys found - at an average of £825 each. Collectively, that's over £1 billion.
In most cases, landlords will cite professional cleaning, damage to fittings, excessive wear and tear and unpaid bills as reasons for holding back deposits - but sometimes you may not necessarily be in the wrong.
If you're about to step into the world of renting, or you are already a tenant, there are procedures you can follow to boost your chances of getting a full deposit back. Here's our guide in full.
1. Check the inventory small print - take pictures
(Image: Getty)
Just one in five tenants sign photo inventories before moving in, meaning in many cases there's rarely any real evidence of whether the damage existed before they signed the contract, or not.
Mark Scott, legal director at law firm Blake Morgan, explains: "Since 2007 a landlord granting an assured shorthold tenancy must protect a tenants deposit in one of the approved tenancy deposit schemes.
"This has helped considerably, but disputes still arise regarding the release of a deposit at the end of a tenancy and usually regarding cleaning costs or a dispute over fair wear and tear to the rented property."
Mark adds that tenants should go through every detail of the inventory before moving in, taking into account what furniture and fittings exist, and the condition of the items.
"Before and after photographs are a good idea. Both parties should try and be present when the tenancy finishes and the agent carries out the checkout process," he adds.
Danielle Cullen, managing director at StudentTenant.com, says: "Without having proof of the condition of the property before moving in, people are risking losing deposits when they move out as it's their word against the landlord.
"Both parties must protect themselves and the property and inventories are the single most important thing. They both need to agree and sign a full inventory so, if for any reason there are any problems, there's physical evidence to back up claims.
"If there isn't an inventory available, tenants should request an inventory check or take photos the day they get the keys and send them to the agents. At least then they have some visual proof of the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy."
2. Raise any concerns as soon as possible
If you experience an issue with your home during your tenancy, don't wait until the end of your agreement to flag it - as you could find yourself paying for it.
Any damage to fixtures, fittings or items that came with the property, that aren't your fault, such as appliance malfunctions, should be reported and a record kept.
Take photos (with a time stamp) where necessary. Email your landlord, and keep a copy of that email.
If you're renting through an agent, ask them to raise the concerns with the landlord too, and keep some form of evidence of the conversation, just in case you later need to refer to it.
When it comes to minor issues such as the kettle on the inventory running its course, you'll also find notifying your landlord can actually help the situation - as they'll then be able to replace it.
3. Is your deposit protected?
It's important to know who does and doesn't need to use a deposit scheme. If your tenancy agreement is an AST (Assured Shorthold Tenancy) then your landlord legally has to use a deposit scheme.
That applies to the vast majority of tenancies in the UK. But, if you rent as a lodger and live with the owner of the property, they aren't required to.
SpareRoom director Matt Hutchinson explains: "Your landlord must, by law, tell you which scheme they're using, how to claim your deposit back, what you need to do if there's a dispute and what the landlord is entitled to make deductions for.
"They have 30 days to do so. If they don't, they can be ordered to pay you up to three times the deposit."
In England and Wales your deposit can be registered with Deposit Protection Service, MyDeposits and Tenancy Deposit Scheme. There are separate TDP schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
poll loading Do you know if your deposit is protected? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No
As a rule, your landlord must use a TDP scheme, even if your deposit is paid by someone else, such as a rent deposit scheme or your parents.
In the event of a dispute at the end of your tenancy, you can get in touch with your scheme's alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service which is a complaints body that helps to settle disagreements.
They will gather information from you and the landlord before deciding on the deposit amount which should be returned. Both you and your landlord must accept the decision made by the ADR service.
If your landlord hasn't used a TDP scheme when they should have done, you can take them to court to claim compensation instead. It's best to wait until your tenancy has ended to do this, so you don't put yourself at risk of being evicted.
7. You may be entitled to THREE times your deposit
The law is very strict with regards to landlords who don't comply with their legal obligations regarding tenancy deposits.
If a landlord refuses or fails to put the money in the scheme within 30-days, they could be subject to a financial penalty.
"The main implications of a landlord failing to register the deposit and/or provide certain information relating to the deposit are a) a financial penalty and b) a bar to serving a section 21 notice to end the tenancy unless the deposit is returned to the tenant," explains Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law.
To put it into perspective, the financial penalty can be anything from one to three times the amount of the deposit.
4. Money CAN'T be deducted for general wear and tear

As with anything, it pays to know your rights. One of the key things to note is that your landlord cannot deduct money from your deposit for general wear and tear.
Citizens Advice housing expert Martin Coates explains: "When you leave a rented property, money should only be deducted from a deposit if the property has been damaged, something has been broken or if you have fallen behind on rent. Money can't be taken off for general wear and tear.
"A landlord cannot request money if something is simply worn out."
This includes minor signs of use such as worn carpets, minor scrapes and scuffs on the walls and faded curtains.
"If your landlord tries to charge you for this, you can contact your tenancy deposit protection (TDP) scheme who will put you in touch with their alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service," Coates adds.
5. Flat hunting? Don't just hand over money

If you're currently house of flat hunting, experts say you should go with your gut when it comes to handing over any initial money.
"If something feels odd, or the room seems too perfect and it leaves you saying ‘what's the catch?' chances are that's the case," explains SpareRoom's Hutchinson.
"You should definitely avoid handing over money for any property you haven't had a chance to visit, even if the landlord gives you seemingly legitimate reasons for why you can't see it.
poll loading How long do you plan to stay in your rented home? 0+ VOTES SO FAR 6 months or less A year or less much than a year
"The first red flag should be if anything seems too good to be true. You should also be wary if you're ever asked to pay money up front before seeing the property.
"If you have any doubts about a property you see advertised, give the website a call or email them to ask them to look at it for you," he adds
If you've viewed the property but still have doubts, you can ask to speak with the previous tenants about any issues they had with the property - your letting agent should be well equipped to advise you on this too.
6. Fix any damages before you move out
(Image: Getty)
As a tenant, you should be aware that you have a general legal obligation to return the property as you found it, although some allowances may be made for reasonable wear and tear.
Any damage beyond this, such as broken appliances that don't belong to you, could jeopardise any returns of a full deposit, so it's worth fixing it before you move out (you may find this works out cheaper too, especially if it's a house share).
"In the event that the landlord/agent notice problems with which the tenant agrees, the tenant is able to offer to rectify the issue before the landlord incurs costs which he may look to hold the tenant liable for," explains DAS Law's Rogers.
"The tenant may be able to resolve the issue themselves or at a cheaper cost than what the landlord may incur.
"This method may assist the tenant in maximising the chances of receiving their full deposit back," she adds.
8. Hold on to ALL documents
(Image: Getty)
It's really important to keep track of any documents, information and correspondence around your tenancy during your lease and until your deposit is returned.
Here's a full list of what StudentTenant suggest you should keep hold of until the day your deposit is returned:
Tenancy Agreement Check-in inventory - make sure you have copies signed by both parties too. Check-in/Check-out photos Keep records of any correspondence with your landlord/agent - if you made phone calls, make notes of the date/time and what was discussed. StudentTenant suggest following up any phone calls with an email too.
9. Play nice!
(Image: AFP)
Ultimately, one of the safest ways to make sure your deposit is returned is by looking after the property.
David Cox, chief executive of the UK's professional body for letting agents, ARLA Propertymark, explains: "Rented properties must be returned in the condition they were given in the beginning.
"Should the property be returned in another state, deductions can be made in order to help put the property back in order. There are a number of appropriate reasons as to why a landlord or letting agents may withhold a deposit."
To prevent this from happening, Cox says tenants should ensure that there are no outstanding bills or rent when they move out and damages are all fixed.
During your tenancy, looking after the garden (or keeping it in the state you received it) will also help, as will general maintenance, such as opening windows to ensure ventilation - this could otherwise lead to costly damp repairs.

JAKARTA - To ensure security for the 2018 Asian Games, which will see thousands of international athletes and officials descend upon the Indonesian capital, Jakarta Police chief Inspector-General Idham Azis has instructed officers to shoot criminals on sight to fend of street crime, particularly motorcycle thieves and muggers.
"If the muggers fight back (when police officers try to arrest them), chief Idham has instructed us to take firm action by shooting them. (We will have) zero tolerance," Jakarta Police spokesman Senior Commander Argo Yuwono said on Tuesday (July 3).
Argo recalled a recent mugging attempt that took place in the Kota Tua area in West Jakarta, when one of the perpetrators, identified as R, was shot dead by officers.
According to the police, the victim, Public Housing and Works Ministry official Syarif Burhanudin, was riding his bicycle when R reportedly grabbed his fanny pack. Syarif tried to hold on to his bag and fell to the ground.
The police later tracked down R and his partner, but both allegedly fought back during their arrest. R was fatally shot and his accomplice was arrested.
Following that incident, investigators discovered that the two had been part of a network of muggers called Tenda Oranye (Orange Tent) based in Teluk Gong, North Jakarta.
"We've identified the leader of the mugging group," Argo said.
Another robbery that took place on Sunday evening in Cempaka Putih, Central Jakarta, ended in the death of the victim.
The woman, identified as W, was on the back of a motorcycle taxi and reportedly held on to her bag as it was being pulled by a man on a motorbike. She then fell, fatally hitting her head on the road.
Through a statement released on Tuesday, Cempaka Putih Police said they had confiscated several objects as evidence in the case, namely a black bag, a mobile phone, two small wallets containing Rp 1.1 million (S$104) in cash, an umbrella and a comb.
Jakarta Deputy Governor Sandiaga Uno said the recent spate of mugging attempts across the city should be taken seriously.
"These crimes might be triggered by poverty. This is a social phenomenon that can be solved by giving poor families access to ways that can improve their economic situations," he said.
On June 17, several other mugging attempts occurred along Jl. Jendral Sudirman in Central Jakarta. Some of the victims mentioned similar characteristics when describing the perpetrator: a man in all black, wearing a full-face helmet and riding a Honda CBR motorcycle.
A passenger of an app-based motorcycle taxi named Dio said his driver was robbed on June 18.
"There's a motorcycle gang near Sampoerna Strategic Square [on Jl. Jendral Sudirman]. I was shocked and everything happened so fast that I didn't get the chance to pay attention to the mugger's licence plate number," Dio said.
A passerby named Paulina Heras said her phone had been stolen the night before Dio's incident. The robbery occurred as she was walking alone in the nearby Tosari area.
"I filed a report to the Jakarta Police to find out that four other robberies took place that night. Two more incidents happened the following morning," Paulina said.

Local businessman Prentice Panton said he is close to inking a deal with Jamaica's Health Ministry to supply that country with cannabis oil medication.
Mr. Panton said Jamaican hospital Hope Institute has expressed interest in his supplying the medication which is manufactured by Lions Garden.
The local businessman said he sent 10 fluid ounces as a sample to the hospital and said he is awaiting word from the hospital's Head Doctor for approval.
She is currently on vacation but Mr. Panton said he expects plans to be finalised on the doctor's return.
“One of the Head doctors will lead doctors on the issue when she comes back. If she wants more we're gonna give them like a gallon and they're gonna look at ways of signing a contract with them hopefully where we will be able to supply the entire Health Ministry,” Mr. Panton explained.
Mr. Panton said his company in Jamaica is also ready to supply the cannabis oil medication in Cayman.

× Rapper Meek Mill granted bail
Meek Mill will soon leave prison.
After spending nearly five months in jail following a controversial November ruling, the Philadelphia rapper, who received a sentence of two to four years in prison for violating probation, was granted bail on Tuesday by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
“I'd like to thank God, my family, my friends, my attorneys, my team at Roc Nation including JAY-Z, Desiree Perez, my good friend Michael Rubin, my fans, The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time,” the rapper, whose full name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, said in a statement obtained by CNN. “While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive. To the Philadelphia District Attorney's office, I'm grateful for your commitment to justice — not only for my case, but for others that have been wrongfully jailed due to police misconduct.”
Mill received a two-to-four year prison sentence in November for violating probation on a 2008 gun and drug case. (He was arrested after being involved in a fight and arrested again for popping wheelies on a dirt bike.) Judge Genece Brinkley cited a failed drug test and the rapper's noncompliance with a court order restricting his travel in her sentencing order.
Earlier this month, the Philadelphia district attorney's office recommended a new trial for Mill. But after a judge denied Mill bail, his plea was moved to the state's Supreme Court.
The case has sparked outrage from criminal justice reform activists. Mill received widespread support from notable artists and athletes, including Colin Kapernick, rappers T.I. and Rick Ross, New England Patirots owner Robert Kraft, comedian Kevin Hart and Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin.
Rubin told CNN he hopes to pick up Mill from prison on Tuesday evening.

House Split On Immigration Might Be Good Politics For Some Moderate Republicans
Enlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli/AP Rich Pedroncelli/AP
House Republican leaders are struggling to contain a growing split within their party over immigration policy. But for some vulnerable moderates breaking from some of the GOP's hardest-line proposals could be the key to avoiding defeat in November.
Californian Steve Knight is one of nearly two dozen House Republicans who have signed on to a petition to force the House to vote on immigration proposals as early as next month. The plan is to allow the House to vote on at least four bills, including a pathway to citizenship that many conservatives hate.
That plan frustrates House leaders who worry a messy fight on immigration will divide the party and boost Democrats' chances of winning control of the House in November. But Knight said Monday in an interview at a Memorial Day event in his home district that he is confident that it's better for him if they at least try to pass some immigration legislation.
"This is doing probably one of the hardest things in America that we've ever tried to do," Knight said. "I underhand that but I think we have the votes to get something done."
Knight said the best path forward is a bill to combine some measures for increased border security with legal protections for the roughly 800,000 people who stand to lose protections under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. He said he's heard from voters in his district and he's confident that is what they want.
"People have said that consistently," Knight said. "If I just don't listen then I'm not listening to the people in my district."
That position puts him at odds with many in his party, including House conservatives and President Trump.
Trump continues to lean into the same hard-line position on immigration that was his signature in 2016 — he wants a wall along the border with Mexico and broad crackdowns on illegal immigration. He told a crowd in Tennessee Tuesday night that Republicans need to be tough if they want to win.
"And you can say what you want, but I think border security and security in general is a great issue for the Republican Party," Trump said. "I think it's a great issue. Not a bad issue."
But Democrats and many moderates disagree. They say a majority of Americans oppose a wall, and point to polls like a recent ABC News/Washington Post survey that showed 86 percent of voters support the DACA program.
The issue is even more personal in California, a state that is home to nearly 30 percent of all DACA recipients.
That's part of why Knight is willing to risk angering party leaders. He represents one of the 23 districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but voted for a Republican for Congress. Democrats believe Republicans are unpopular across the country and particularly here, in part because of issues like immigration.
But Democrats here haven't figured out the right way to campaign against a Republican like Knight. With less than a week to go before their June 5 primary, the two top Democrats are at odds over whether they should court progressives or stick to more moderate policies that could help them win votes from a wider range of voters. In California's system, all candidates — regardless of party — compete in the primary and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election in the fall.
Bryan Caforio is the most progressive of the Democrats running here and he says Knight's rogue move signing the immigration petition won't be enough to set him apart.
"It's a huge issue and frankly Steve Knight isn't doing anything on it," Caforio said while knocking on doors in the high desert city of Palmdale. "Signing a discharge petition, that probably won't go through when four bills will be put up anyway, some of which are horrible, is nothing but trying to confuse people into thinking he cares."
His opponent Katie Hill takes a more moderate approach. She's in line with party leaders in Washington who want to trade some border security money for DACA protections. She argues its the right way to win votes in this moderate suburban district.
"We are going to have to make sure that we've got the best possible chance of defeating him in the fall," Hill said in an interview at a canvassing kickoff last weekend in Simi Valley.
The two Democrats are at odds over more than just immigration in a race that has grown increasingly tense in recent weeks. Hill insists that her moderate approach is the only way Democrats stand a chance of beating Knight in November.
Recent analysis from The Cook Political Report ranked the seat as a toss-up that could trend more favorably for Democrats if she wins in the primary.
But, Knight says he isn't worried about facing one of them in November.
"This district has never flipped," Knight said.
The California Republican is confident that his position on immigration is right for his district. He said he knows immigration is a tough issue for Republicans but he says its not for him.
Plus, he says, voters have a lot more on their minds than just immigration.
"We got into Congress to work on military, veterans and small business," Knight said. "That's what we've done. They know that. The veterans know that. We've kept our word."
Bert Brionies, a Democrat here, agrees. He says he respects that Knight took his own route on immigration. Plus, he likes Knight's work on local issues.
Briones knows Democrats need to defeat Republicans like Knight to win control of the House. But, he trusts his congressman and he's planning to vote for him in November.
"I'm more in favor of Knight. He's been in office longer," he said. "I'd like to stay with the Democrats but if I see that someone has ideas that would favor my way of thinking then yea, I'd sway towards that."
Knight's split on immigration may infuriate Republican leaders but it could be the key to helping the GOP keep their House majority.

TruePublica Editor: I spoke to some influential Brexiteers just before the decision was made by the electorate to Brexit. The reasoning by one was not that he thought the EU was bad for Britain but that everybody in the EU thought the EU was bad and when the EU27 started to break down, Britain would be in the premier league once again – on its own to benefit from the fallout.
This may still prove right as the EU is now facing some terrible decisions and dilemma's as a result of defying an angry electorate across the bloc, especially as 2019 will be holding the EU's MEP elections. Italy, is just one more of quite a few member states who have spawned anti-EU political parties getting into power. More on that another time.
Since the divisive referendum decision was given by a Conservative party bent on saving itself from implosion, more than thinking of Britain's economic welfare, there's been talk of a second EU referendum. Well, now we have confirmation that a real effort is underway.
The campaign for a second Brexit referendum will start next week according to none other than – George Soros, who has pumped £700 million into the ‘Best for Britain' campaign. Best for Britain is registered with The Electoral Commission.
The campaign starts with demanding that MPs recognise its right to see another vote on EU membership:
“Regardless of how people voted in 2016, it's become clear that there is growing public demand for a new chance to decide our country's path as new facts come to light.”
Speaking at an event held by the European Council for Foreign Relations think tank in Paris on Tuesday, Soros described Brexit as an example of “territorial disintegration” and blamed it for impairing the workings of the EU, according to the Times that is.
“Most of the damage is felt right now when the European Union is in an existential crisis, but its attention is diverted to negotiating a separation agreement with Britain. That's a lose-lose proposition, but it could be converted into a win-win situation,” Soros said.
Got that. The European Union is in an “EXISTENTIAL CRISIS.” The billionaire investor has described the EU as being in disintegration mode.
Soros confirms that Brexit will, and I quote cause a “hard-to-fill hole in the European budget.”
“The EU needs to transform itself into an association that countries like Britain would want to join, in order to strengthen the political case,” Soros also said.
Soros has, in no uncertain terms confirmed that without a major political transformation, a massive financial hole is about to appear in the EU's budget, that the bloc is in disintegration mode and the worst crisis it has ever faced, an existential one, is just months away.
Finally, Soros said:
“The economic case for (Britain) remaining a member of the EU is strong, but it will take time for it to sink in.”
About £700 million he thinks will be needed for that to sink in.
From the man who blatantly attacked Britain's currency through the raid against the Bank of England in September 1992, that taxpayers had to be replaced from the treasury and walked off with the equivalent of one thousand million pounds for personal gain – Isn't all that a bit contradictory George?
His campaign is not about Britain's welfare, it's about the EU's welfare – clearly.
It's all very confusing now. Many people I have spoken to have changed their minds in both camps but make no mistake, Soros will be joined by others, £700 million is just the start. By this time next year, could Britain be back in Europe's biggest club?
In the meantime, as has just been pointed out to me since posting this article, a campaign started a month back to achieve the same – it's called The People's Vote and it's being organised by a coalition of about 9 pro-EU groups (see: this). They all work closely together and as one group they will NOT work with ‘Best for Britain' because it is funded by Soros. That doesn't mean that ‘Best for Britain' supporters won't be welcome to march with the on June 23rd, but they cannot claim it is ‘their' march.
The People's Vote campaign has two aims; first, that the people must have a vote on the ‘final' deal (whatever May's mess of a government comes up with) and, second, one of the options must be to remain with the EU. The plan is to press for the vote first because that will bring those who voted to leave on board (a lot of them aren't happy with what's going on) and then insist on the remain option being included.

'The Epitome Of New York Cool': Letterman Biographer On Late Night Icon
David Letterman, one of the most famous people in America, is an enigma. Jason Zinoman's new book, Letterman: The Last Giant of Late Night, looks at the late night talk show host's long career and the impact it still has on broadcasting today.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:
David Letterman hosted late night TV for more than three decades with his own brand of quirky funny, like stupid human tricks, throwing a watermelon off a roof and those daily top 10 lists, such as the top 10 things that sound cooler when a rapper says them.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN")
DAVID LETTERMAN: And the number one thing that sounds cool when said by Snoop Dogg.
SNOOP DOGG: I'm just a simple old hockey mom from Alaska, you betcha (ph).
(LAUGHTER)
LETTERMAN: There you go.
MCEVERS: It was weird and it was funny. But still, Letterman had this cool detachment that kept people guessing about who he really was and how he became the person he was. Jason Zinoman set to find all that out in his new book, "Letterman: The Last Giant Of Late Night." Zinoman is a comedy critic for The New York Times. He interviewed a bunch of Letterman's friends, family, coworkers and, yes, Letterman himself. And Zinoman says yeah, Letterman could be cranky and aloof. But at the same time, he was relatable to almost everyone.
JASON ZINOMAN: Letterman seemed to me as, like, the epitome of New York cool.
MCEVERS: Right.
ZINOMAN: Which is bizarre when you think about the fact he comes from Indiana. And I think that's one of the - you know, the interesting accomplishments that he had as a broadcaster, is he could appeal to both sides.
MCEVERS: In the book, you describe his career as having these three great artistic periods. What were they?
ZINOMAN: Well, the first period is - began on the morning show in 1980 and goes to 1984. In a lot of ways that was partly defined by Merrill Markoe, who was his, you know, girlfriend and artistic collaborator. And this was a much more kind of writerly show. The writers really had a huge impact on it. And they did a lot of innovative, clever conceptual work around a host who at that time seemed more like a traditional broadcaster. His second period is when he starts to get famous and the show kind of becomes bigger and more visually ambitious. That's when you have, like, the monkey cam and you have...
MCEVERS: Right.
ZINOMAN: ...The Velcro wall and more spectacle. And then in the last period his writers become less important and he is more open in terms of storytelling. He turns his own life into comedy and his own kind of prickly personality into comedy more often. So you move from the first version of a kind of conventional-looking host surrounded by this crazy show to the third period when you have this fascinatingly eccentric host surrounded by what's a more traditional talk show.
MCEVERS: You know, how important of an influence was Merrill Markoe on David Letterman? I mean, would you write a Letterman book today if it weren't for Merrill Markoe?
ZINOMAN: No. I mean, I think one of the arguments of this book is that Merrill Markoe is the unsung hero of Letterman's career. This is not a new thing. You know, people have pointed out that she has been - she was important to him and even the first head writer. But I hope the book kind of puts some meat on the bones of this argument. We think about talk shows as all about the host. And the truth is that these are much more collaborative affairs than people realize.
MCEVERS: Tell me about it (laughter).
ZINOMAN: Yeah, you know. Exactly. You know. I mean, it's - I mean, you get all the credit and you get all the blame, right? The - but she created the remotes that...
MCEVERS: The remotes. You mean the story - like, field stories.
ZINOMAN: Exactly.
MCEVERS: Yeah.
ZINOMAN: This idea of going into the - onto the street and talking to normal people and cutting it into a comedy piece that was not scripted was a relative - it wasn't unprecedented, but was a relatively new idea. You know, stupid pet tricks she came up with, viewer mail she came up with. Merrill Markoe was a comedy genius in her own right.
MCEVERS: It's interesting that he was normally so aloof on stage. You write that he actually - he had this smirk on his face like there was a joke that only he knew but, you know, didn't have to tell anyone else. And that was kind of his move. But then there were these vulnerable moments. At one point he was famously being blackmailed by someone who threatened to reveal that he was having an affair with a member of his staff. He actually talked about it on the show. Let's hear just a clip of that.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN")
LETTERMAN: Now, my response to that is yes, I have.
(LAUGHTER)
LETTERMAN: I have had sex with women who work on this show.
(APPLAUSE)
LETTERMAN: And would it be embarrassing if it were made public? Perhaps it would. Perhaps it would, especially for the women.
(LAUGHTER)
MCEVERS: He made a joke out of that. But he also had this, you know, really serious moment right after 9/11. He also introduced the doctors that performed his - you know, his quintuple bypass. From what you found out, how did he decide to let his guard down like this?
ZINOMAN: I think in both of those cases events forced his hand. The affair - he had to address it somehow. And, I mean, think about the amount of times you've seen politicians do news conferences having to confess affairs and how badly it's gone.
MCEVERS: (Laughter).
ZINOMAN: Nobody has ever done that better than David Letterman.
MCEVERS: (Laughter) Right.
ZINOMAN: I mean, that was - they should study that at, you know, whatever, the Kennedy School or something...
MCEVERS: Right, make it into a joke (laughter).
ZINOMAN: I mean, you heard that clip you just played. They're applauding and laughing...
MCEVERS: Yeah, right.
ZINOMAN: ...After the confession. And I think there's something tremendously moving about a guy who is normally not very emotional, who normally is a little repressed allowing himself to be vulnerable like that.
MCEVERS: There was - there was darkness, too, right? I mean, this is not a guy who is super happy-go-lucky. I mean, there was a reason that that persona came across on the air of someone, you know, with kind of this ironic smirk at times and at other times kind of cranky, right? I mean, did you - did people who worked with him, you know, confirm that narrative?
ZINOMAN: Yeah. I mean, that was a consistent refrain. I mean, I would often ask, you know, what was the happiest you ever saw David Letterman to people he knew, and then there was usually a long pause. You know, the - and...
MCEVERS: (Laughter) Wow.
ZINOMAN: But, I mean, I think the - you know, the context of this is before David Letterman, late night talk shows had the mood and spirit of, like, local TV banter - a lot of pufferies, a lot of forced smiles, a lot of promoting your movies. And Letterman came along and he showed some antagonism toward show business. He showed his mood. If he thought you were, you know, full of hot air he let you know it. And I think he spoke for a lot of people in the audience who were like, finally, someone is...
MCEVERS: Yeah.
ZINOMAN: Someone on TV is saying the way we all feel. I mean, I think that the darkness is integral to understanding his greatness.
MCEVERS: How do you think David Letterman will be remembered?
ZINOMAN: I think he'll be remembered as somebody who revolutionized the television talk show, who created a template and a vocabulary for irreverent, innovative work in that form. And I think he'll be remembered as a - you know, the rare comedian with gravitas, a figure who could speak after 9/11 and a figure who when he left his show people cried. This was a person who had an incredible intimate relationship with, you know, this country.
MCEVERS: Jason Zinoman, author of "Letterman: The Last Giant Of Late Night." Thank you very much.
ZINOMAN: Thank you. This was great.

Sometimes, hitting a major birthday can be a milestone, a turning point in one's life.
We've all heard of the old "life begins at 40" adage" and there are many people who dread turning 30, fearing that they are leaving their wilder days behind them and having to finally do sensible and serious things like buying homes, babies and marriage.
Scots singer Amy Macdonald, who is hitting the highways and byways of Britain for her latest tour, has just notched up that 30th milestone.
So was it a reason to celebrate or comiserate?
"Turning 30 wasn't a big deal for me at all," she said. "In fact, It sort of brought an end to my first ten years in the business very neatly.
"It is ten years since my first album and just after my birthday, I found out that my sales have reached twelve million worldwide - so my memories of turning 30 are extremely happy!"
Her fourth album Under Stars was released earlier this year.
Amy is hoping for more of that happiness when she arrives in our region on November 5. She'll be appearing at Scunthorpe's Baths Hall in support of her fourth and latest album Under Stars - a quite appropriate title seeing as outside the venue, the skies will be filled with the bright lights of Bonfire Night.
She's understandably pleased with the album which was released to great critical acclaim earlier this year.
"I'm looking forward to getting out there and playing live again," she said.
"The new tour is an acoustic tour - I've done so many shows over the years where I've done a little acoustic set and it has always gone down so well I wanted to expand on that."
"Playing songs acoustically means interpreting and playing them in a whole different way, so the process of rehearsing and getting ready can often be a lot more complex than an ordinary tour.
"For me, acoustic shows have a magical feeling. Smaller, intimate venues and a chance to play songs that mean something to me and the people listening to them. I'm really looking forward to it."
Since first bursting onto the music scene back in 2007 with songs such as Mr Rock 'n' Roll and This Is The Life, the Bishopbriggs-born star has enjoyed worldwide success and met with the approval of critics across the globe.
She's rubbed shoulders with Ellen DeGeneres in the US, played a string of festivals, appeared on TV countless times and enjoyed number ones internationally.
And she's also worked alongside Kinks legend Ray Davies, is engaged to Scottish Premier League footballer Richard Foster and has collected a clutch of awards.
Not bad for a wee Scots lassie who heard Travis performing their song Turn at T In The Park in 2000 and decided that she'd like to play it herself and so ended up teaching herself to play her dad's guitar at the age of 12.
But the trappings of fame don't come without some drawbacks.
The fiercely proud Glasgow girl and a fan of Rangers, is no longer able to attend games at her beloved football club - especially Old Firm derbies against the club's deadly city rivals Celtic.
She said: "I tend to stay away from the Old Firm games, they tend to be a little bit crazy. It is difficult to go to places like that, because people can recognise you and it can become a bit uncomfortable."
The schedule of touring and soundchecking also means she doesn't get much beyond the venue she's playing at - which can be another frustration.
"Sometimes you are at the venue from 8am but not actually on stage until 9pm so there's a lot of waiting around. But you are needed for setting up and the soundcheck so It's difficult to go anywhere. I grab a coffee and go for a quick wander around and that's about it!"
But she wouldn't have it any other way.
She's looking forward to getting out there once again and presenting her new album as well as the rich collection of guitar folk-tinged classics from her impressive back catalogue.
"People seem really excited and we're really looking forward to it.
"It should be a really great atmosphere We'll be playing some of my best-loved songs - it will be a mix of all four of my albums, so there will be something for everyone."
Of her latest album Under Stars, she said: "It's been about 2 and a half years in the making which is the longest I've ever taken with an album. At the time I wanted things to happen quicker but now that it's finished I'm glad we've taken the time; it feels like it's had the TLC that it deserves.”
Amy added: “I feel so proud of the songs and am so pleased with the record. There are so many incredible moments and I really feel this record features some of my best work. I'm excited to finally share it with my fans and I believe there is so much that will also appeal to new fans."

KELHEIM, Germany — Viscose specialty fiber manufacturer Kelheim Fibres presents a mixture of new and well-established — and further enhanced — products at index17 in Geneva.
Flushability remains one of the most important topics. With their flat short cut fiber, Viloft®, Kelheim Fibres offers the first viscose fibre for rapidly disintegrating wet wipes. Nevertheless, the Bavarians do not rely on the performance of the fiber and their experience of more than 10 years in this area alone — quite the opposite in fact: together with the local wastewater authorities and renowned pump manufacturer WILO, comprehensive tests on products containing Viloft® were conducted in 2016.
“We wanted to go one step beyond the requirements of the flushabilty guidelines and we see what actually happens in practice – that is to say down in the sewage system. In contrast to traditional (spunlace) wipes, which led to clogging and blocked pumps, wipes made of Viloft® have passed the test with flying colors. Furthermore, our close cooperation with the wastewater authorities has made clear to us how much damage to the sewage systems is really caused by incorrectly disposed wet wipes. The increased maintenance costs amount to almost 200 Mio € per year in Germany alone — and, at the end of the day, these costs are paid by the consumer”, says Matthew North, Commercial Director at Kelheim Fibres.
In addition to their rapid disintegration, which eases the load on the pumps, wet wipes made of Viloft® and wood pulp are compostable: they consist of 100-percent cellulose and are fully biodegradable.
Hygienic fibers remain another important topic for the world-leading manufacturer of viscose fibers for the tampon industry. Their patented, extra absorbent specialty fiber Galaxy®, the highest hygiene standards as well as a deep understanding for their customers' needs to enable long-lasting peer-to-peer partnerships. The ”External Business Partner Excellence Award 2016“,recently received from P&G, is proof of this.
Nevertheless, the innovative fiber experts step up to new challenges, too: Kelheim Fibres' in-house R&D has developed a new fibre named Electra, which can be used in a wide range of applications for the dissipation of static charges. Currently, Kelheim is testing the possible use of this fiber in connection with sensitive electronic components.
Kelheim Fibres displays these products and more functionalized specialty fibers at booth no. 2415 at Index17 in Geneva.

Police have launched a search for a missing father and his two young children after they vanished on the way to nursery.
Robert Roche, 36, has not been since leaving the family home with his three-year-old son Joey and 18-month-old daughter Betsy on Monday morning.
Detectives are "very concerned" for the welfare of Robert and his children who have not been seen since Monday morning at 9am.
Family members raised the alarm and called police when Robert failed to return home from the day nursery in Holland Road, Hove, Sussex at 5.30pm.

Robert is described as white, 5'10", stocky, with dark hair, and was pushing daughter Betsy in a distinctive black 'buggaboo monkey stroller" buggy with a pink hood. There is also a step and a ‘saddle' by the handle bar.
Detective Inspector Mick Jones said; "We are searching the local area. and are keen to hear from anyone who has spotted Robert and his children.
"If you see them or know where they might be, please let us know right away on 101 or 999, quoting serial 1053 of 14/08.
“We also ask Robert to get in touch with us so that we can arrange to meet and confirm that he and the children are ok.
“We are not treating the disappearance as suspicious at this stage but it has not happened before and we are naturally very concerned for Robert and especially for his children.”
Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley pulled no punches when assessing his side's disappointing draw at home to bottom side Coventry, saying it would be kind to rate his players “two out of 10” for some aspects of their play.
“We know we didn't play well,” said the Dons boss. “I can't hide from that fact. We missed Tom [Elliott, suspended] and we tried to go with pace with Lyle [Taylor], Dom [Poleon] and Barchy [Andy Barcham]. But they defended deep – they're big and we struggled to get hold of the ball.
“Second half, we tried to play with a bit more width but again they did a good job and we didn't have enough flair, creativity and knowhow to open them up and create chances.
“We never got our fans going at all tonight, we wanted to give them something to cheer about but we were poor.
“Football can be simple when things are going well and there's a lot of confidence and trust or it can look like it did today. It can look like the hardest game in the world and that's what we made it look like.”
But former Crazy Gang member Ardley called on the never-say-die spirit that has run through the club's history and pointed out one positive from two poor displays, after another late draw against Charlton on Saturday.
“We've played awful today,” said the Wimbledon boss. “I can't disguise it as anything else, and we played pretty poor for a large part of Saturday but we haven't been beaten.
“So there's something, where we have the spirit that this club loves and demands, and we'll just keep going and we can take something from it. We're trying to build and we're trying to at least put those points on the board and ensure we are a League One club next season.”

CARSON, Calif. — Ryan Hollingshead had a goal and an assist, helping FC Dallas beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 3-2 on Wednesday night.
Dallas (6-1-5) is unbeaten in its last six games against Los Angeles (5-7-1).
FC Dallas scored two goals seven minutes apart in the first half. Mauro Díaz sent a pass along the top of the 18-yard box and Ryan Hollingshead curled it inside the post in the 33rd minute. It was Díaz's seventh assist of the year. In the 40th minute, Hollingshead passed it across goal to find Cristian Colman at the far post for a bouncing header.
Carlos Gruezo added a breakaway goal in the 66th for a 3-0 lead.
At Mullaly Bikepark in the South Bronx, cheers compete with the clicking of wheels and the thump of tires. Wearing T-shirts and hoodies, bikers pedal fast, then take off from ramps, soaring into the air. Whether they nail the landing or wipe out, the crowd continues to cheer.
"Being here, it's like hearing joy," says photographer Elias Williams, who has been documenting the park near his home for the past few years. "This place is so much more than the tricks."
Williams photographed the bar stands, backflips and grinds, but the images really celebrate 30 years of BMX culture and camaraderie. Created by enterprising kids who started racing their bikes on dirt tracks like the motocross stars in the 1970s, BMX didn't need rules or referees. Williams says the dedication of the bikers inspired him to keep coming back. Their mantra is "DIY PMA": Do It Yourself Positive Mental Attitude.
In 1988, Victor Ortiz and fellow members of a scrappy BMX crew called the Rad Dogs turned an abandoned ice skating rink into Mullaly, New York City's first bike park. A few years later, biking buddies Lou Perez and Robert Ramos of another crew, Underground Never Dies, organized a group of volunteers to support the park.
"Things were kind of falling apart," says Ramos, who now works for the Parks Department. "We were the next generation coming to fix it so we could have a place to ride."
They doubled the amount of ramps right away, worked on bikes and maintained the space. When money gets tight, they've always found a way to find more.
Everyone pitches in, helping Mullaly become the "mecca of East Coast DIY-style BMX." A diverse fraternity of different races and ages ranging from 5 to 50 years old loves the park, coming to do more than just ride. The older guys often see themselves as mentors.
"I'm one of the OGs, so I have a responsibility to carry myself well," says Tyrone "Skillz" Means, who has been riding there since 1992. "When you're coming out of the 'hood, you need something."
Williams made portraits of the riders not only posing proudly with their bikes but also playing catch, chess and even music together. They pull out electric guitars and plug their phones into a green boombox. Metallica is a favorite.
"With Mullaly, the brotherhood here, the vibe is just so strong," Means says. "Even when people come here from different countries, states or boroughs, the first thing they say is the vibe is just so dope here."
Williams thinks of it more like a community center than a park. It's rare for BMX riders to find a park in New York that welcomes them.
"They're not the characters you see in videos jumping on cars, getting in all sorts of trouble on the streets," says Williams, who often works on projects focusing on underrepresented communities in his own backyard like the St. Albans neighborhood of Queens, where he grew up, after the foreclosure crisis devastated much of the black and middle-class community there.
"I don't see the need in traveling far to contribute to conversations I find important," he says.
Mullaly Bikepark is a home, and seeing it reveals what the men there are really about, what BMX is really about.

ERs have become a dumping ground
Re: Why hospital ERs are so overcrowded; it's not patients' fault, Dec. 4.
In the late 1990s, political decisions were taken to downsize the number of Ontario hospitals and establish a new structure designed to make the supersized hospitals more effective and efficient. The theory was to make the hospitals operate like businesses under a CEO who would be accountable and have authority to make major decisions. Twenty years later, we have a “one size fits all” policy wherein crowded ERs, frustrated clients, harassed workers and lengthy waiting times are common.
Dr. Alan Drummond expresses the many problems that have resulted in this mess. Let us consider only one: “inappropriate overuse by patients presenting with non-urgent problems.” This begs the question of the meaning of the word “emergency.” What are the boundaries between urgent and non-urgent? Has the decline in the supply of family doctors and community clinics forced patients to use the ER as a multipurpose clinic?
ERs have become a dumping ground. Is there no responsible authority to address this outstanding problem? Let the debate begin.
Marie Ellen Reid, Ottawa
Hospitals have become frightening places
Dr. Alan Drummond's opinion piece comes across as sad and frightening. All this talk of our hospital Emergency departments having insufficient beds, overcrowding, over the top hospital occupancy rates, no ward beds (or alternative accommodation) for our elderly, and caring physicians and nursing staff being run into the ground.
I wonder how many of us totally believe Dr. Drummond when he says the problem is not misused by patients but rather, that our overarching health care system is in trouble.
Well, perhaps you should sign up to be a volunteer in an ER. You'll soon see first-hand exactly how brutally accurate Dr. Drummond is. You'll experience how very desperately sad some of the daily situations in an ER are and how extraordinarily frightening the reality of our medical system is.
My husband and I are getting older. I'm very concerned. You should be too.

Let's clean up the recyclables
The garbage and recycling collection is disgraceful due to the policies of this city. Box containers simply do not work. Every week there is either plastic crap blowing down the streets, or paper and cardboard soaring on the wind – on to front gardens and into the hedges and trees in the parks. Admittedly it all gets covered in snow; but come the spring, the city looks like a garbage dump.
Why don't we do what Smiths Fall does and place all the recyclables into clear plastic bags? The contents are easy to see, and it saves the garbage operator two journeys to the curb, thus being more efficient and cost-effective. And there will no longer be streams of plastic and paper detritus decorating our streets.

This autumn, tech heavyweights Apple and Google both revealed high-cost, high-performance smartphones within a few weeks of each other.
If you're planning to upgrade your phone and need to know which is the best one to go for, chances are these two devices will come out near the top of your list.
Both will take a sizeable chunk out of your bank balance and offer you top-level performance and features in return - not to mention looking pretty impressive in the hand.
(Image: AFP)
But deciding which one to go for means lining them up against each other and seeing how they compare in several key areas.
Read on to find out which one is actually worth your cash.
Design
Apple changed up the design of the iPhone drastically for the X and proclaimed it the blueprint for smartphones for the next ten years.
It's certainly a looker. The device is almost all screen, and Apple has dropped the home button and dramatically reduced the bezels around the edge of the body.
There's a "notch" left at the top of the screen containing the speaker and front-facing camera that's dividing opinion, but otherwise the iPhone X is a pretty seamless piece of industrial design. The back is glass, similar to the iPhone 8 , meaning it supports wireless charging and the dual-lens camera has been bolted onto the back, albeit in a vertical alignment rather than a horizontal one.
The X measures 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7mm and weighs in at 174g, making it thin and light enough not to be noticeable in your pocket.
Google has followed a similar design plan with the Pixel 2 XL by making it all about the screen.
The company has dropped the bezels - although not quite as much as Apple - and given the 6-inch OLED screen a 2,880 x 1,440 resolution. That goes up against the Phone X's "Super Retina" display, which has a resolution of 2,436 x 1,125 (458ppi).
Google's more detailed display is due to the phone functioning as a VR headset when you combine it with the Daydream View headset.
Both phones are not only waterproof and dustproof but also ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. If you want to use headphones you're going to need wireless headphones like Apple's AirPods or Google's Pixel Buds, or use the adaptors included with both.
When it comes down to it, we feel Apple has the edge on the design front over Google in this case.
Camera
If there's one thing that smartphone companies like to quibble over, it's the strength of their cameras.
Google laid down the gauntlet at its recent Pixel event by proclaiming that DxOMark gave the Pixel 2 XL the highest mark of any smartphone camera ever. Which is impressive, but probably carries little weight for most users weighing up the devices in a store.
This year Google is changing the camera setup slightly and switching to a dual-pixel sensor, whereby each pixel is actually made up of two smaller ones. To compensate, the lens aperture has been expanded to let in even more light.
(Image: Droidlife)
More importantly, the company is offering unlimited cloud storage for all your pictures - which gives it a real tangible advantage over the iPhone X. If you take a lot of pictures, the Pixel 2 XL may be the phone for you.
Apple's iPhone X, by comparison, has dual cameras on the rear, giving users a 2X optical zoom and the ability to capture a depth-of-field effect known as bokeh.
Bokeh is an effect often used by fashion photographers to make the subject appear to pop out of the picture, and involves blurring the background of the photo while keeping the subject in focus.
The dual cameras feature two 12-megapixel sensors, autofocus, optical image stabilisation and LED dual tone flash.
In terms of tricks, both cameras have a few at their disposal. The iPhone X's "TrueDepth" selfie camera is made up of a dot projector, infrared camera and flood illuminator, allowing it to accurately map and recognise a face.
These depth-sensing technologies work together to securely unlock the iPhone X, enable Apple Pay, gain access to secure apps and many more new features.
Meanwhile, Google Lens is a smart piece of software that uses the camera to recognise things like writing, products and even landscapes. So you snap the picture and can immediately look up the subject using the company's artificial intelligence smarts.
If you're looking for practicality - storage, information and the like - you're best off going for the Pixel 2 XL. But if you want stylish effects then you may be swayed by the iPhone.
Power and battery life
The iPhone X runs on Apple's own six-core A11 "Bionic" chip, which the company claims is the most powerful ever in a smartphone.
It has 3GB RAM and a choice of 64 or 256GB of internal storage - with no option to expand that via a microSD card. The non-removable battery offers up to 21 hours of talk time and up to 60 hours of music play.
Google, by comparison, has packed the Pixel 2 XL with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor and 4GB of RAM. There's a choice of 64GB or 128GB of storage space and likewise no option to add to that with a microSD card.
There's a 3,520 mAh non-removable battery inside the Pixel 2 XL that Google states will last "all day". What's more, 15 minutes connected to the charger is enough to get you seven hours of power.
Software
Part of the appeal of both these phones is that in each case the company is responsible for both the hardware and the software. Meaning both devices should be running as efficiently as possible.
The iPhone X runs Apple's latest operating system iOS 11 while the Pixel is rocking the latest version of Android, known as Oreo.
Both iOS 11 and Android Oreo introduce new multitasking features, allowing two apps to run side by side on the screen - so you can watch a video on YouTube while replying to an email, for example.
The Android Oreo update focuses on making applications run more smoothly on the phone, with features like background limits, to prevent individual apps chewing through the phone's resources.
Meanwhile iOS 11 introduces new interactive and multimedia experiences, like looping live videos and augmented reality apps.
The software is arguably the main thing setting these two phones apart, so it's worth trying out both iOS 11 and Android Oreo before making a decision.
Special features
Google is selling the Pixel XL 2 heavily on the strength of its camera and the artificial intelligence smarts of the Google Assistant. You can squeeze the sides of the phone to launch the Assistant which uses all of Google's search knowledge to help organise your life.
The iPhone X, by contrast, is offering the TrueDepth camera which enables users to unlock their phone using a facial recognition system called Face ID.
(Image: Daily Mirror)
The TrueDepth technology also enables users to create Animojis - 3D, live rendered emojis, which track your facial expressions and create animated characters to use in Messages.
Price
If you're looking to save money, neither of these phones are going to do you any favours.
The 64GB iPhone X costs £999 while the 256GB version is £1,149.
The Pixel 2 XL is slightly cheaper at £799 for the 64GB model and £899 for the 128GB.
Choose your poison.
Verdict
More than anything, the decision comes down to which operating system you're more comfortable with. It's unlikely that either the iPhone X nor the Google Pixel 2 XL are strong enough propositions to woo users from rival camps to swap over.
If it's price and practicality, we'd opt for the Pixel as its promise of unlimited photo storage and the benefit of the Google Assistant put it ahead of Apple.
Apple gets props for aesthetic and the design of the screen - but realistically we need a bit more for £1,149 than a bezel-less screen, wireless charging and face-tracking emojis.
Bill Belichick is a normal guy, like the rest of us. It's just that he wins Super Bowls while we watch from home. But we're all equals when the fast food bug strikes.
Some brave soul deftly filmed the coach's otherwise unremarkable trip through a Chick-fil-A drive-thru recently and the footage is delightful. Belichick dons a priceless expression: slightly exasperated, indifferent, and annoyed — all at the same time.
We're assuming he's none-too-happy about this showing up on MyFace, InstaFace, and other sites he's so up on. Oh well, he's on to Next Meal.

Katie Price's bizarre antics at a nightclub on Saturday have been slammed as "very shocking" and "cringeworthy" by revellers who thought she was less entertaining than the Chuckle Brothers.
As Mirror Online exclusively revealed this week, Katie showed up late and "in a state" to Cube nightclub in Bangor, Wales, where she was being paid to entertain clubbers and do some meet-and-greets.
But the former glamour model's erratic behaviour sparked concern from witnesses who watched as she made people kiss during an awkward game on stage and jokingly told the crowd she was pregnant.
(Image: Twitter)
(Image: Twitter)
One clubber said she was "the worst act" they'd ever seen and was outperformed by the Chuckle Brothers, who had appeared at Cube a few days before the Pricey.
"She was a complete state and a huge embarrassment," they told Mirror Online.
"She couldn't take a simple picture and she was clearly annoying the security staff. The Chuckle Brothers were ten billions times better than that wretched mess."
Another reveller revealed how Katie was shot down by nightclub staff after telling the crowd they could have half-price drinks.

"She was very random and seemed unsure about what it was she was supposed to do," the second source said.
"She'd asked the bouncer on stage with her, who she needed to talk to about lowering the prices of drinks, after shouting out, 'Who wants half price drinks, 50 per cent off all night', until a Cube worker shock his head and said no.
"It was a very awkward encounter that left the crowd feeling an overwhelming sense of embarrassment for her and confusion."

The clubber went on: "Me and my friends wanted to go upstairs as it was just awful to watch, but then my friend was chosen to go up on stage as he was gay, to participate in the kissing tasks.
"It was not only cringeworthy to watch but also very perplexing. She was hyper and exhibiting such erratic behaviour that the crowd was laughing at her, not with her.
"I don't know what I feel more let down by, Katie's appearance or me for having wasted £3 to see her car crash of a performance. The whole night was a massive mess and Katie was the biggest failure of any 'celebrity' I have seen at Cube.

"Considering Bangor is a University town and attracts a young demographic, it is a huge shame to have seen her in that state setting a bad example," they added.
Mirror Online has contacted reps for Katie but received no response.

Cash-strapped Greece was last night believed to be contemplating ditching the Euro and switching to the US dollar - in a move which would humiliate Brussels.
Ted Malloch - Donald Trump's pick for EU ambassador - has revealed how senior Greek economists are looking into taking on the American banknotes if the country turns its back on the European currency.
Due to Greece's crippling financial crisis, officials are said to be desperately hunting an alternative to the Eurozone.
Prof Malloch revealed the controversial move would ‘freak out' Angela Merkel.
His comments come just four days after one of the EU's most powerful finance chiefs warned Greece will be forced out of the Eurozone if it fails to address its ailing finances.

He was quizzed on Greek TV, about his claim that a “Grexit” by Greece would be the best option for residents, because the current situation was ‘simply unsustainable'.
He said: "I know some Greek economists who have even gone to leading think tanks in the US to discuss this topic and the question of dollarisation.
(Photo: Getty)
"Such a topic of course freaks out the Germans because they really don't want to hear such ideas," he added.
Greece's economy fell in the fourth quarter of 2016 as the debt-laden country faces stalemate in negotiations with its creditors.
Athens faces debt repayments of 7.0 billion euros this summer that it cannot afford without defusing the feud that is holding up new loans from Greece's 86 billion euro bailout.
'LA Times' Journalist Was Granted Rare Access To Pyongyang Celebration
David Greene talk to Jonathan Kaiman of the Los Angeles Times, who was invited by the North Korean government to cover the 105th birthday celebration of the country's founder.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Tense moments this morning for Jonathan Kaiman of the LA Times and other Western journalists. They had been invited to North Korea to watch a parade honoring the country's founder. We reached Jonathan on Skype just as he was trying to get out of the country.
JONATHAN KAIMAN: I'm with a large group of journalists, tourists and diplomats. We arrived at the Pyongyang International Airport at about 7 o'clock this morning for an 8:30 a.m. flight back to Beijing. And we have been here ever since. It's been about eight hours now. There are a few dozen of us hanging out by the gate. We have no word about what's happening. The departures board just went dark. We just don't know whether this is political. We know that China has been putting pressure on North Korea to dial down its rhetoric after a series of missile tests. We know that American Vice President Pence is in South Korea right now.
GREENE: Yeah. And Pence in...
KAIMAN: But...
GREENE: ...Seoul earlier made these comments about North Korea not testing America's resolve. I mean, could that have something to do with you - them not letting you out yet?
KAIMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. Tensions are very high right now, and there's a very good chance that this has something to do with the political situation. That being said, this is North Korea. It's a poor country, and there's a good chance that Air Koryo's mechanical situation isn't up to par - there was a computer failure or a radar failure, and the only guy who can fix it hasn't been in touch. So we just don't know.
GREENE: This is an extraordinary moment for you to be there and trying to come home as Vice President Mike Pence is, you know, is sending a pretty tough message from right across the border in the demilitarized zone, suggesting that North Korea should not test America's resolve here.
KAIMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. And the U.S. has been sending extraordinarily tough messages for the past week or two. And we've seen signs here that it has rattled the North Korean leadership. I've heard from several government minders, who have been assigned to us here in Pyongyang, that the Syria strike in particular has been very unnerving for the North Korean leadership.
They fear a preemptive strike on North Korea, and they've ratcheted up their rhetoric about how they are willing to respond. So it has been a very tense time. That being said, North Korea has been involved in tense standoffs with South Korea and the U.S. intermittently for the past several decades. So...
GREENE: This is an important point, though. I mean, it sounds like you are describing a government that is almost on a war footing and is taking these warnings from the United States very seriously.
KAIMAN: It certainly seems that way. North Korea has threatened to attack the U.S. in the case of a preemptive strike, and that is very clear. The only real channel through which we're getting any sense of how the North Korean government is thinking about this is that Trump is the wild card. They don't know what he'll do.
GREENE: What was this parade like, Jonathan?
KAIMAN: I think it was probably more - far more intense in person than any image or any video would really let on. We were standing right next to the columns of tanks and the goose-stepping soldiers. And you could smell the diesel coming from these tanks. Every time these soldiers boots hit the ground, you would feel the ground reverberate. It was a very intense experience.
The military parade, also, was followed by a more civilian parade. Large crowds of Pyongyang residents were gathered around these floats with their eyes gazed up at the rostrum where Kim Jong-un, their supreme leader, was standing, tears running down their faces, shouting long live.
GREENE: You are suggesting - I mean, there is true loyal devotion among many North Koreans for this man.
KAIMAN: Absolutely. And, you know, the thing about being here that makes it so frustrating - it's impossible to drive a wedge between what's real and what's fabricated or what's forced and what's genuine. I mean, of course they live under tremendous fear that if they step out of line, the consequences are just unspeakable. I mean, these labor camps up in the north of the country have been very well-documented.
And it's not only dissent that could get you sent to one of these camps - it's even disillusionment. It's these - what we would consider the smallest offenses. So there absolutely is an element of fear. But if you realize that these people also grew up under a system which has presented the leader of the country as a godlike figure and they're presented with images of this figure from when they're small children. And that registers.
GREENE: Then we have this failed missile launch. I mean, did North Korean officials who you've dealt with, your minders, acknowledge that as, you know, as a disappointment?
KAIMAN: No. I think the dwelling on the failure of the missile launch is a bit of a red herring. One, they didn't even know that the missile failed. Even when missile launches are successful, North Korean state media won't run news about them for a day after the launch. When they fail, state media doesn't report them at all. So among the North Koreans I've spoken with, almost all of them have, one, not known that a missile launch occurred and, two, refused to believe that it did fail. And when I pressed them on it, they said that even if it did fail, that failure is essentially just a stepping stone to success.
GREENE: I know you cover this story from your post in China. Do you remember a moment of tension this high?
KAIMAN: No. I think there were moments in 2010 when there was an artillery volley between North and South across the border. Tensions were very high. In 2015, when there was another round of tensions and Kim Jong-un put his military on wartime footing, tensions were high. But that was usually a North-South thing, and the U.S. was sort of in the background.
This time, I think because of Trump's unpredictability, because of Kim Jong-Un's unpredictability - he's fairly new to the role. He's only been the top leader for a few years - and because of all of these other variables with China, with this new leadership coming in the South - they have elections coming up very shortly - there are so many unpredictable factors. And I've never seen anything like this.
GREENE: And you - just so we know, I mean, you and a number of other journalists are just hanging out there now. I mean, can you find something...
KAIMAN: Yeah.
GREENE: ...To read?
KAIMAN: Well, the bookstore doesn't sell much beyond, you know, "The Collective Works Of Kim Jong Il" and "The Collective Works Of Kim Il Sung." So both those get old quick. But we have food. There are snacks. The Pyongyang International Airport is fairly modern. I think China helped them build it a couple years ago. There's coffee. We just opened a bottle of champagne to pass the time. So morale is still high even if anxiety is mounting.
GREENE: Jonathan Kaiman, Beijing bureau chief for the LA Times. He and a group of journalists is being held at the airport in North Korea. They weren't sure why. We can safely report now their flight has now departed. Jonathan is on his way home to China.

X Factor runner-up Olly Murs is reportedly signing up to be a coach on The Voice.
It's said that he'll replace Gavin Rossdale on the panel, joining Sir Tom Jones, Jennifer Hudson and Will.i.am on the ITV talent show.
But apparently, the move has left his former mentor and X Factor boss Simon Cowell a little angry.
Olly, 33, rose to fame after coming in second place on the show in 2009, later returning to host alongside Caroline Flack in 2015.
Now a TV insider has told The Sun : "It's a huge coup for The Voice to have Olly on board.

"He's got talent show experience, comedic charm and a huge fanbase. His personality will shine through as a coach.
"It won't be like when he presented X Factor when he had to remain impartial."
But the source added that Simon "isn't happy" about Olly swapping allegiances, especially since he left the X Factor to apparently concentrate on his music.
Mirror Online has contacted Olly's representatives and ITV for comment.

We've also reached out to Simon's reps.
Gavin was axed from The Voice earlier this year.
The Bush frontman , 51, joined the judging panel after the BBC series moved to ITV.
But, after just one series, the rock star, who is the father of model Daisy Lowe , has been dropped by the show's bosses.

MAYNARDVILLE — The principal of a Union County middle school where a student's video about bullying went viral over the weekend said Monday that he wasn't aware of repeated bullying of the student, Keaton Jones, and that the incident described in the video had been resolved.
In the video, Jones, a sixth-grader at Horace Maynard Middle School, describes having milk poured on him and ham put down his clothes at lunch.

Keaton Jones video went viral Friday
The video was posted on Facebook on Friday by Jones' mother, Kimberly Jones, and over the weekend garnered the attention of celebrities, athletes and the public, all of whom were quick to condemn bullying with the hashtag #StandWithKeaton.

"It's not as rampant as the video would have you believe," said Principal Greg Clay. "I can't tell you what was done, but I can tell you action was taken with the children."
Clay said he wasn't aware of Jones being repeatedly bullied and that the incident described in the video had been resolved weeks ago.
Kimberly Jones said in her Facebook post that she picked her son up from school early Friday because he was afraid to go to lunch.

She did not respond to a Facebook message seeking comment Monday morning.
The school is planning on holding an assembly today to address bullying with students, Clay said. He said the media would not be allowed to attend.

Anti-bullying talk planned
An anti-bullying talk has also been planned for January "even before this came out," Clay said.
He said Horace Maynard Middle School is no different than many other schools where bullying can also be a problem.
"We're having a good school year," Clay said. "I'm sorry it's like this. We all sympathize with Keaton and we're doing everything we can to make sure it never happens again. Everybody saw the video and it was horrible. We don't want anyone to feel like that. Keaton's a good kid. We'll take care of him."
Other parents respond
Other parents in the school district said Monday that bullying is a problem from time to time, but they didn't think it was any more of an issue in Union County than elsewhere.
LeAnn Ray, whose son is in seventh grade at Horace Maynard, said he faced a bullying problem last year. She reported it to the school resource officer, who "handled it pretty well" and after that "the kid left him alone," said Ray, 43.
Becky Vandergriff, whose daughter is also a seventh-grader at the school, said she hasn't experienced bullying but that she was upset about what happened to Jones.
"She's fortunate she's never had that happen," said Vandergriff. "She doesn't think it's right. I tell my children to treat everybody with respect. I don't care what the situation is and if you see someone bullying another child, take up for that kid."

Two decades have passed since six fictional unemployed men from Sheffield put on a striptease to earn some badly needed cash in The Full Monty.
Overnight the feel-good movie became a box office sensation, making £197million worldwide.
The smash hit, featuring stars such as Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy, became one of the most heartfelt UK films in history. Down the years it has inspired big names – ­including Prince Charles – to recreate its magic moments, some pictured here.
Tonight a whole new set of famous faces are taking on the stripping challenge in ITV's The Real Full Monty.
The tribute, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, follows seven stars as they learn the routine under the eye of Ashley Banjo from Diversity.
They are Harry Judd from McFly, Towie's Elliott Wright, ballet dancer Wayne Sleep, Olympic swimmer Mark Foster, Emmerdale's Matthew Wolfenden, TV host Dom Littlewood and Danny John Jules of Red Dwarf.
And as these new pictures prove, the lads were not shy about going the whole hog in front of a live audience.
The show aims to raise awareness of male cancers. Wayne, 68, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year.
He said: “If I hadn't gone for a medical I wouldn't have known of it and wouldn't be here today.”

12 bare facts about the original movie
(Photo: ITV)
The famous final striptease was filmed at Sheffield's Shiregreen Working Men's Club in front of 400 extras. None was told the boys would do the “full monty” for real – to make sure their screams of excitement sounded real.
The cast agreed to take everything off as long as it was only one take. To give them courage, director Peter Cattaneo allowed alcohol on set.
To make sure they remembered their moves, the choreographer lay in front of the stage but off camera to shout out instructions.
The film had two working titles: Eggs, Beans and Chippendales and No Man's Land. In Germany it was All or Nothing and in China a slip-up in translation had it as Six Naked Pigs.
Paul Barber – Denzil in Only Fools and Horses – plays Barrington Mitchell and if producers had their way, Rodney Trotter would have played Robert Carlyle's role. But Nicholas Lyndhurst said: “It would have been too cold at that time of year to take your clothes off.”
It was made for just $3.5million but raked in $257.9million worldwide. It was the 10th ­
biggest-grossing movie that year and is No24 in the top-grossing British films of all time. Not bad considering the list includes Skyfall, Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Robert Carlyle admitted he hated making the film, branding it “a load of pish” and was convinced it would bomb at the box office.
It won an Oscar for Best Score but Hot Chocolate's You Sexy Thing was the standout hit. The film put the song back in the top 10.
Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy said many US studio execs didn't understand the term “full monty” and could not understand why there was no one called Monty in the film. Some American cinemas gave viewers a leaflet explaining some of the British slang.
The opening sequence features a real 1972 Sheffield promotional film, City on the Move. The studio bought it from the makers for £400.
Casting directors visited the local Silverdale School to find the boy to play Robert Carlyle's son. William Snape, now 32, wasn't bothered about auditioning – until he realised he would get six weeks off. “My hand shot up,” he said.
To celebrate its Yorkshire heritage, the film was given its world premiere in Sheffield.
The Real Full Monty is on ITV tonight at 8.30pm.
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Pentagon spokesman says the two U.S. soldiers killed Sunday in Iraq were casualties of a U.S. artillery “mishap.”
The spokesman, Army Col. Rob Manning, said an Army artillery unit was firing on an Islamic State mortar position “when a mishap occurred.” He said there is no indication that IS played a role in the deaths. In addition to the two soldiers killed, five others suffered injuries that Manning said were not life-threatening.
The spokesman said he could provide no other details because the incident is under investigation. The names of those killed have not been publicly released.
When the deaths were announced Sunday, the U.S. military said the incident did not involve enemy fire, but provided no other details.

Familiar sounds fill a familiar scene: a ready-for-TV gourmet chef's kitchen. But unexpected is the cook- blanching broccoli, searing ribeyes and wielding a knife.He's 13-year-old Jake Dizon from Glenview, and one of Food Network's newest contestants.Tuesday night, Jake will be featured in a new episode of "Chopped Junior," where kid-chefs face off in a three round elimination cook-off."You start out in the first round, you're given a mystery box with four mandatory ingredients. You have to use those in your cooking. And then the challenge is to work with all of the crazy ingredients they throw at you," Jake explained.Before Jake donned an apron, he went through an application process including a Skype interview and two phone interviews. Long. But, for him, also worthwhile."It was an extremely fun experience, super exciting. And I would probably say so far the best experience of my life."This passion didn't sprout up overnight and has blended with Jake's other interests."I think a lot of it has to do with... he loves science and he loves weird flavor combinations and he approaches cooking much like science and much like a science experiment," said his dad, Mike Dizon.Jake's parents say he's the best cook in the house-not surprising when you hear Jake's twist on a usually simple classic:"I think the first time he made mac and cheese from scratch it was a Gouda truffle mac and cheese. And it was really good," laughs his mom, Niki Dizon.And three years after Jake advanced beyond cracking eggs for her, he has a signature dish."Seared steak, rice pilaf, mushroom cream sauce, roasted vegetables and blanched broccoli.""We make a good team because he loves to cook and we love to eat," his dad said matter-of-factly.His little brother Liam's a fan too."It's really good."Jake has the lingo down. His food? Mouthwatering. And he can even plate the dish.Now we'll just have to see if the Chopped Junior judges feel the same way.The show airs Tuesday night at 7 p.m. central time.

BENTON, IL (KPLR) - There's a big winner in a small town. The winning ticket for Monday's $11,250,000 Illinois lottery jackpot was sold at a Circle K in Benton, IL.
“It's a total shock,” said one resident. “I'm glad somebody finally won from Benton.”
As of Tuesday night, there was no word from lottery officials about a winner stepping forward. Many of the residents we talked with said a winning ticket could do a lot of good in the Franklin County community.
“Here in this little community for someone to get that ticket would just be absolutely awesome,” said State Rep. Dave Severin, (R) Benton.
He said the state has lost so many jobs he hopes the winner doesn't forget where they bought their ticket.
“People in southern Illinois are very awesome people, very caring and giving. This community takes care of each other,” said Severin.
One resident hoped the winner would donate money to the food pantries in Benton and the school district.

Thousands of people were reduced to tears in London on Saturday after Bristol mum Nicola Romero described how her daughter Becky would still be alive were it not for cuts to the NHS.
Mrs Romero's emotional speech captivated thousands of people attending a mass rally to support the health service, which saw campaigners from all over the country come together.
Among speeches by the politicians and health campaigners, Nicola Romero spoke passionately for almost five minutes, telling tens of thousands the story of her daughter Becky, who took her own life at home in Bedminster Down in July last year.
The 15-year-old's death was recorded officially by Avon Coroner Maria Voisin in December as an accident, which was contributed to by neglect – that neglect being the ‘gross failure to provide basic medical attention' by the NHS's Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS).
The coroner heard that when Becky had to be admitted to a mental health unit, there were no beds in Bristol and she ended up 80 miles away in Bournemouth. After she was sent home, she spent 13 days at home without being assessed by a medically qualified mental health professional, before her death.
The coroner's formal verdict – that a lack of NHS resources amounted to neglect and was a contributory factor in Becky's death – has sent shockwaves through the NHS, and has sparked Nicola Romero and her friend Kaz Higgins to launch Becky's Campaign, which is calling for better resources for young people's mental health care.
She told the rally, which was called ‘Emergency Demonstration – NHS in Crisis', that if the NHS was ‘funded adequately', her daughter would still be alive.
“I would like to give my sincere thanks to the CAMHS staff that tried to help Becky,” she said.
“I felt their frustration as they tried help to Becky. They're under so much pressure with full workloads and huge waiting lists.
“There simply aren't enough beds available in in-patient units and there's not enough staff to cope with community care, leaving our vulnerable children desperate without the care and support they deserve.
“Meanwhile, NHS staff are at breaking point, suffering with stress and fear, because they cannot provide, with non-existent resources, to children like Becky. And they'll come to harm, or could die as a result,” she added.
“We need to get early intervention working in schools.
“This will take away a huge workload from CAMHS and prevent deterioration in children while they wait many, many months for assessment.
“CAMHS budget needs to be ring-fenced so that CCGs spend the money they are given for CAMHS on CAMHS and not use it to compensate for cuts in other areas.
“This means that proper funding is needed for the whole NHS,” she said.
Mrs Romero said she was so badly affected by the death of her daughter that she too contemplated taking her own life.
“We all use NHS services at various times in our lives. These services are vital as I myself found out after Becky's death,” she said.
“I fell to pieces and I couldn't stand the pain. I didn't want to be here, I just wanted to be with Becky.
“Without the CAMHS help and support, I wouldn't be here alive today. Our NHS desperately needs more funding now.

“What kind of future will our children have, if they can't get the care and support they need and deserve?
“If the NHS was funded adequately, my daughter would still be alive. How much more blood can the hands of the Government hold?” she asked.
Three coachloads of campaigners and NHS staff on their days off travelled from Bristol to the rally in London, at the end of a week of campaigning here in Bristol.
It began with a successful battle to persuade bosses of the North Bristol NHS Trust to abandon the idea of setting up a private company to employ staff, and included the painting of a ‘Three Billboards' mural in Stokes Croft.
The campaigners had the backing of three of Bristol's MPs – Kerry McCarthy, Thangam Debbonaire and Darren Jones – who put their names to an open letter to the Bristol Post which claimed that ‘only mass protest' would be able to save the NHS from privatisation.
The campaigners were also boosted by a video message of support from Bristol mayor Marvin Rees.

Crystal Palace will have Damien Delaney available for Tuesday's visit of Swansea after he missed Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal through suspension.
Manager Sam Allardyce could recall the defender should he make changes to his team ahead of their second match in three days, with James McArthur and Joe Ledley also in contention.
Against Arsenal, Allardyce substituted Yohan Cabaye, Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke in preparation for Tuesday's fixture, so each are expected to retain their places.
Swansea is without suspended defender Jordi Amat for the Premier League relegation battle at Crystal Palace.
With prospective new manager Paul Clement expected to take a watching brief at Selhurst Park, caretaker Alan Curtis will consider changes after a fourth straight league defeat against Bournemouth.
Wayne Routledge will be checked after missing out on Saturday with a mouth abscess, while striker Fernando Llorente is doubtful after picking up a knock against Bournemouth.
Crystal Palace squad: Hennessey, Speroni, Ward, Dann, Tomkins, Delaney, Kelly, Fryers, Lee, Ledley, Phillips, Winter, Husin, McArthur, Townsend, Boateng, Zaha, Cabaye, Mutch, Puncheon, Benteke, Campbell, Flamini.
Swansea squad : Fabianski, Naughton, Van der Hoorn, Mawson, Taylor, Britton, Cork, Barrow, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Llorente, Nordfeldt, Rangel, Kingsley, Fernandez, Fulton, Fer, Dyer, Borja, McBurnie.
The United States has conducted “lawful” strikes against the Syrian government forces and pro-government forces as part of the US-led coalition's military campaign against Daesh terrorist group, US President Donald Trump said.
WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — US President Donald Trump wrote in a letter to the US Congress on Monday that since the last periodic update report, United States Armed Forces participating in the anti-Daesh campaign in Syria have undertaken "a limited number of strikes against Syrian government and pro-Syrian government forces".
"These strikes were lawful measures to counter immediate threats to the United States and partner forces engaged in that campaign,” Trump wrote.
Comprised of more than 70 members, the US-led coalition has conducted airstrikes, ground-based and rocket-propelled artillery fire against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. The strikes in Iraq are conducted in support of the Iraqi government, but those in Syria are not authorized by the UN Security Council and the Syrian government.

According to the latest figures of the Operation Inherent Resolve, at least 801 civilians have been unintentionally killed by the coalition's strikes in Syria and Iraq as of November.
During an unannounced visit to the Hmeimim airbase earlier on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria to their permanent bases after over two years of an anti-terrorist aerial campaign. According to US Defense Department spokesperson Eric Pahon, the withdrawal did not affect US priorities in the country.
Russia began a military campaign in Syria in late September 2015 at the request of Assad to fight Daesh terror group. For the past two years, the Russian army has performed hundreds of airstrikes.
During the Syrian campaign, Russian troops have cleared out more than 90 percent of Daesh-held territories, including the ancient city of Palmyra.

Bristol's food scene has gone from strength to strength in recent years with a host of brilliant new openings.
Cargo in particular has proved a huge hit, gifting us with some of the city's best restaurants from fancy eateries to budget bites.
It's also been starting to pick up praise on a national scale with esteemed foodies heaping healthy doses of praise onto it in their publications.
Recently a food writer for The Telegraph chose the mini village of shipping containers as her favourite place to eat out in the UK, and now one of the most renowned food critics in the country has made his fond feelings known about the whole city's restaurant scene.
The Observer's Jay Rayner is known for his fierce demeanour, which has earned him the nickname ‘Acid Rayner', and is never afraid of controversy.
He's a multi-award winning writer with a seriously discerning taste but Bristol has clearly done something to impress him.
In a YouTube interview with Guild of Fine Food, he picks Bristol as the city with a restaurant scene which stands out the most in the UK, aside from London.

He goes on to say: “The one city that stands out, outside of London, which has really thrown forward interesting things is Bristol.
“The independent restaurants in Bristol are always thrilling and I have a continually growing list of places I need to go back and look at.
“I think it's part of the independent culture that's embedded in Bristol itself, not just the food but the whole city.
“They're willing to support those independent, small-scale restaurants with maybe only 20 or 30 seats and they're using them every night of the week, not just on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night. That's the way to make a thriving restaurant sector.”
× Man claims age discrimination after Starbucks bans him for asking 16-year-old barista on a date
SPOKANE, Wash. – A 37-year-old man says he was banned from a Starbucks in Washington state after asking a 16-year-old barista out to dinner, KREM reports.
The man, who was not identified by KREM since he has not been charged with a crime, said he was at Starbucks in Spokane last week and wrote a note asking out a barista.
“I was flirted with by a barista. For some reason she thought I was funny. Said I was funny. So I gave her a note to see if she'd be interested in dinner,” the man wrote in a Facebook post.
He said that when he went back the next day, a police officer told him he was banned from the Starbucks.
Spokane police said businesses are allowed to refuse service to people for as long as they see fit. But the man says he's facing discrimination due to his age.
“I know the female Starbucks barista was of legal age to date,” the man said. “I broke no laws. I merely took a chance with my heart. I'm tired of hearing the word ‘creep' as any black person or gay person is tired of hearing certain words. I have a whole webpage dedicated to age gap love.”
He asked his friends on Facebook to call Starbucks and complain — but the request was met with opposition.
Many people took to the Spokane Starbucks' Facebook page to praise the store for barring the man from the location.
“I have never been so proud to be a Starbucks customer!” one user wrote. “As a teen I had to deal with similar issues working in a restaurant as a hostess. It is an uncomfortable position no girl want to be put in. Thank you so much for supporting your employees.”
A Starbucks spokesperson said, “We have no tolerance for any such inappropriate behavior or harassment, and we will continue to support our store partners and local authorities investigating the situation.”
The Fall Kickoff Tailgate event has been moved due to inclement weather.
The tailgate will be held in the Red Room at The Dow Event Center on Oct. 7 at 5 p.m.
The Dow Event Center invites those who plan to go to the Saginaw Spirit game to come to the tailgating event free of charge.

Netflix users have been warned to be on alert after a new phishing scam has been reported.
The email - claiming to be sent by Netflix - threatens to shut down the users' account if they don't confirm the details of their billing information.
Streaming site viewers risk giving fraudsters all their credit card details if they fall victim to the email scam.
The scam started in America - with local police sharing screenshots to warn local citizens - but UK users are also believed to be at risk.
(Image: Facebook)
(Image: Facebook)
"If you encounter this email, or any email you believe to be fraudulent, close it out without opening the links," Grand Rapids Police said in a Facebook post.
"If you would like to check the status of any account that you have online, we recommend that you go directly to the website and login as you normally would."
On Netflix's website , it says: “If you suspect you have received a fraudulent email or text message that appears to be from Netflix, follow these tips to keep your information safe and secure, and follow the steps below to report the message.
“Never enter your login or financial details after following a link in an email or text message.
“Never click on any links or open any attachments in an email or text message you received unexpectedly, regardless of the source.
“If you suspect an email or text message is not from Netflix, do not reply to it.”
It's not the only scam of its kind, earlier this month an extremely ‘sophisticated' phishing scam is making the rounds, using fake Netflix branding to fool customers into thinking it's from the firm.
The email, which was first spotted by MailGuard.com , shows ‘Netflix' as the sender, and states that payment has been declined.
It says: “We attempted to authorise the Amex card you have on file but were unable to do so.”
(Image: MailGuard)
It then urges users to update their payment details by clicking an ‘update payment' button.
If users click on the button, it takes them through to a very convincing page, where they are asked to enter their credit card details.

One of Hollywood's biggest names is shown here in character for the first time as Judy Garland for a new film biopic.
The Oscar-winning actress begins principal photography in London this week on Judy, based on the true story of Hollywood star Garland's final concerts in London.
But you would hardly know who it is without being told, so different does she look.
Renee Zellweger, 48, looks a world away from her usual self, with her blonde hair changed to a dark shade of brown and teased into a 1960s style in the picture, in which she appears to sing into a microphone.
The Cold Mountain actress will star alongside Harry Potter actor Sir Michael Gambon in the feature film, which is being directed by double Olivier Award-winner Rupert Goold.
War And Peace actress Jessie Buckley and American Horror Story actor Finn Wittrock will also appear.

Judy is set in 1968 and tells the story of Garland arriving in London to perform in a sell-out run at The Talk of the Town nightclub, 30 years after her rise to fame in The Wizard Of Oz.
The film shows the charismatic yet fragile star's battle with management while dealing with the struggle of spending her whole life in the spotlight and her yearning to be at home with her children.

It also focuses on her romance with musician Mickey Deans, who Garland married several months before her death in June 1969 aged 47.
Judy, a joint venture between Pathe, BBC Films and Ingenious Media, will include some of Garland's best-loved tunes, including her signature song Over The Rainbow.
The video will start in 8 Cancels

Prior to The Fate of the Furious hitting theaters, The Rock and Vin Diesel got involved in a massive feud, and things got a bit out of hand. The cast took sides, shots were continuously fired on social media, and both Diesel and Johnson were even reportedly kept apart during the press tour to avoid any confrontations.
The situation eventually calmed down between the two, and the stars went back to being the family that the FF franchise has always touted as its core. For a few months, it looked like the drama had stopped and the franchise was on course to continue smoothly, but boy, was that not the case.
Buckle up, people, because the drama has come back full force. There are two installments left in the Fast & Furious saga, and the films were scheduled to hit theaters on April 19, 2019 and 2021, respectively. However plans changed when Universal recently announced that #Fast9 was pushed back to April 10, 2020.
The reason behind the move was a mystery, but The Hollywood Reporter speculated over whether or now Dwayne Johnson would return to the franchise. It was a confusing statement considering The Rock's heavy involvement throughout the past few years, but fans were kept in the dark about what had happened, until someone spoke out.
Tyrese Gibson Is Not Happy With The Rock, At All
Tyrese Gibson is more than a little miffed over the delay, and he's blaming #TheRock for the decision. Back in September, the actor called out Johnson publicly, telling him to not delay Fast 9 in favor of his planned spinoff with #JasonStatham. Now, in the wake of the new release date's announcement, Gibson took to his personal Instagram to share the news.
As we should come to expect by now, his post wasn't the average promotional message to keep audiences hyped for the film. Instead, the actor went on a tirade against The Rock, blaming him and his producing partner, Hiram Garcia, for F9's significant delay:
In the caption, Gibson also took the opportunity to make fun of Johnson's critically bashed Baywatch reboot. Adding fuel to the fire, he made it clear that his message was staying up for the world to see and look back on, even if people encouraged him otherwise.
Yikes. The trouble didn't end there, though. A few hours later, Gibson took to Instagram once again, condemning Johnson for breaking up the Fast and Furious family by going for a spinoff as opposed to sticking with the rest of the cast in the main franchise:
Fans haven't been too keen on the actor's outbursts, as plenty of people are already attacking him. It's difficult to speculate on what's happening behind the scenes right now with the little information at our disposal. With that said, it is quite puzzling to see Gibson lash out at The Rock this way, because it seemed like they had a one of the more solid relationships during all of the turmoil.

When the Vin Diesel/Dwayne Johnson feud started, for example, Gibson took to Instagram in a now deleted post to clarify that Johnson wasn't referring to him when he criticized his male costars. To prove it, he posted a video of The Rock singing to his daughter, and pretty much gushed about him:
"Why are you guys so impressionable? A man wouldn't be singing from his heart and soul to another mans little angel if he had a problem with her dad. Does any of us know why bro decided to jump out there with his post? No... Would one assume that IF he's going to jump out there and generalize and say 'Male Co-Stars' he would be more clear and call out names??? Of course he should of. Let me calm you guys all the way down... I don't know WHO he has a problem [with] and I don't have any details of WHAT those problems are –– as a matter of fact if I DID know I would tell you s––t!!!"
Furthermore, while congratulating his cast members for their hard work on #FateOfTheFurious, The Rock talked about Gibson specifically, cracking a good-natured joke about him:
We can speculate as much as want, but aside from these rants it's hard to tell what's happening behind closed doors. All we do know for certain is that this situation is one wild ride for fans, who will come out in droves for the next installment no matter when it hits theaters.
Neither Johnson nor any of his other costars have commented on Gibson's message, but we'll keep you updated if that changes.
What do you think about Tyrese Gibson's comments about the Fast 9 delay? What do you think is happening with the film? Let me know in the comments!

In school (and in life), everyone learns things that aren't really controversial -- we all just kind of accept them as is, content in our knowledge of how the world works. But sometimes (a lot of times, really), the things we all accept as true aren't as simple as they seem, or are just plain wrong. You probably believe a lot of the following things, but unfortunately they're just not true.
President Trump gestures during his rally at Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tenn., on May 29, 2018.
Larry McCormack, The Tennessean
At a campaign rally in Nashville, President Trump repeated a bushelful of false and misleading claims, and added a few new ones:
Trump said the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act was "so unconstitutional." The Supreme Court upheld the mandate. In June 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the penalty can be considered a tax that is within the power of Congress to impose.
The president also said the Senate's failure to pass a bill that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act 'cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving." Congressional budget experts say it would have saved a net total of $321 billion over 10 years.
The president also repeated numerous false, misleading and exaggerated claims on wages, trade, immigration and world opinion of the U.S.
Affordable Care Act
The president held a "Make America Great Again" rally in Nashville on May 29. He touched on numerous topics, touting in particular passage of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” In addition to overhauling the nation's tax code, the new tax law will repeal the tax imposed on certain people who do not purchase a qualified health insurance plan.
The tax, known as the "individual mandate," took effect in 2014 and, under the new law, will be repealed in 2019.
Trump criticized the mandate as unpopular and unfair. But he then added “unconstitutional,” which isn't true.
Trump, May 29: Plus in the tax cuts what did we get? The individual mandate is out the window. That was the most unpopular part of Obamacare. So unconstitutional.
In fact, the Supreme Court ruled the individual mandate was constitutional. In a 5-4 opinion on June 28, 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the “penalty” — as it was described in the Affordable Care Act — is actually a “tax” collected by the IRS, and it is within congressional powers to impose new taxes.
Trump can have the opinion that it should have been ruled unconstitutional, but it was not.
The Republicans included the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill, because they were unable to pass the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, a Republican bill that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act.
Trump lamented the failure to pass the health care bill, which failed 49-51 after Sen. John McCain voted against it in the early morning hours of July 28, 2017, by signaling a thumbs-down. If McCain had voted for the bill, Vice President Mike Pence could have broken the 50-50 tie, and the bill would have passed.
Trump, May 29: It was done, and then, early in the morning, somebody turned the hand in the wrong direction. That cost our country a lot. That was a very, very terrible thing that happened that night. That was a very terrible thing. That cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving that nobody would have known.
Trump is not telling the whole story when he says the bill could have saved the country “$1 trillion in entitlement saving.” In addition to reducing health care spending, mostly on Medicaid, the Senate health care bill would have repealed or modified tax provisions in the ACA that provide increased revenues to the federal treasury.
On balance, the Senate bill would have reduced deficits by a net $321 billion over 10 years, 2017 to 2026, when accounting for the lost tax revenues, according to a joint analysis of the bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. (The analysis was based on the version posted to the Senate budget committee website as of June 26, 2017.)
CBO and JCT, June 26, 2017: CBO and JCT estimate that, over the 2017-2026 period, enacting this legislation would reduce direct spending by $1,022 billion and reduce revenues by $701 billion, for a net reduction of $321 billion in the deficit over that period.
The biggest savings would have come from Medicaid spending. CBO and JCT estimated that Medicaid spending would have declined in 2026 by 26 percent in comparison with current law — a reduction of $772 billion over the 10-year period. As a result, about 15 million fewer people would have been enrolled in Medicaid by 2026, compared with what enrollment would have been under current law, the analysis said.
The savings, however, would have been offset by the repeal and modification of certain taxes. The Senate version analyzed by congressional budget experts would have, among other things, repealed a surtax on net investment income and annual fees imposed on health insurers. The repeal of the investment income surtax, for example, would have reduced revenues by $172 billion, budget analysts said.
Repeating Himself
The president also repeated several claims that we have already debunked — sometimes more than once.
The claim: “And wages, for the first time in many, many years, are finally going up.”
The facts: It is not “the first time” that wages are going up. The upward trend in wages started under President Barack Obama and has continued under Trump. The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 1.1 percent during Trump's first 15 months, after going up 4.0 percent during Obama's eight years. Those figures include managers and supervisors. The real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers have gone up 1.4 percent so far under Trump, after rising 3.7 percent during Obama's years.
The claim: “I say it, and I say it all the time, we are so respected again. I can't even tell you — really, the degree to which people respect our country again. It's amazing. It's amazing.”
The facts: As we wrote, the Pew Global Attitudes Project last year found that citizens in 35 out of 37 countries have less confidence in Trump than they did in Obama — significantly so, in some cases. The decline in confidence in the U.S. president has been “especially pronounced among some of America's closest allies in Europe and Asia, as well as neighboring Mexico and Canada,” Pew found. A more recent Gallup World Poll survey, released in January, found similar results. “Median approval of U.S. leadership across 134 countries and areas stands at a new low of 30%,” Gallup found.
The claim: “So they go and they take this man, right? And he got here and he's got 22 people that came in — his mother, his father, his grandmother, his uncle, his brother, his sister. He got — 22 people come in for this one guy. That's called chain migration — 22 people.”
The facts: Trump is talking about Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, an Uzbekistan-born immigrant charged with killing eight people in New York City on Oct. 31. But, as we have written, there is no evidence that Saipov brought 22 people with him to the United States. In fact, as a green card holder, Saipov could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married and had children in the United States — so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by Trump.
The claim: “Think of it, a lottery. You pick people. Now, let me ask you. So these countries that are sending people in — do you think they are sending us their finest?”
The facts: Trump is again distorting the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Countries aren't “sending us” anybody. Individuals submit applications, and those eligible must meet certain requirements and pass a security background check. Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, told us: “Among other things, the consular officer must make sure the individual is not ‘inadmissible.' This means that the person has not committed a crime, doesn't have a serious health problem, isn't a terrorist, hasn't committed fraud, and hasn't overstayed in the U.S. before.”
The claim: “We lose with Mexico over $100 billion a year with this crazy NAFTA deal.”
The facts: Census Bureau data show that the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico was $69 billion in 2017, up from $63 billion in 2016 and $58 billion in 2015.
The claim: “We passed the largest tax cuts and reform in American history. Larger than Ronald Reagan, many years ago.”
The facts: The tax bill that Trump signed into law in December is not the largest tax cut in history. It is estimated to reduce tax revenues by $1.46 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. It needed to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years to beat the 1981 tax cut under President Reagan, which was 2.9 percent of GDP, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The claim: “So, instead of spending $1 billion and not having it for 20 years, we spent four-hundred-thousand bucks and it opened up in a few months. Is that good? Is that a good story?”
The facts: In discussing moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Trump conflates the alleged estimated cost ($1 billion) of building a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem with the actual cost (less than $400,000) of renovating existing space for the interim embassy that opened in May. The interim embassy will be temporary; the State Department still intends to build a permanent facility.

The City of Johannesburg's Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba together with community leaders and various stakeholders launched a monthly clean-up volunteer campaign.
The cleanup campaign which is set to encourage the reduction of crime and litter within Johannesburg, Mashaba said no investors will show interest in the dirty city.
“There's no way that you can drive economic growth in a filthy city, we must get the basics right,” he said.
Mashaba said the Aresebetsebeng initiative hopes to inspire a sense of community and accountability around cleaning.
“The campaign seeks to unite Joburg residents to work together with government and skilled stakeholders in ensuring that the City of Johannesburg becomes clean,” said Mashaba.
The City reported that it had initiated increased services within Pikitup.
“The largest component of this campaign will focus on cleaning the City, to position it as a job-creating investment and a City which its residents can be proud to call home.”
The campaign will also strive to encourage residents to take better care of the environment by promoting a culture of reducing, reusing and recycling waste in ensuring that Johannesburg becomes one of the cleanest Cities in Africa.

I never know. Growth or just random change. I love some of the old songs and “Dreaming” is the reason we still exist. It's definitely the biggest song and it was the first one we did. The songs just change as life changes and moods change. I don't love to say “growth” because it's just life somewhere else at a different time. All of the atoms that collided in that day just made that song. The state of music is changing so rapidly. Back when we first released “Dreaming,” it came out on a blog and hit this hype machine. We had a label behind it. It just worked somehow. I don't know how that happened or how things become huge out of nowhere. We released a song “Run with the Bulls” between the album and this new EP and we released it on our own. We were just kind of curious of how much clout we would have if we released something new after two years on our own. It's hard, it's not easy. Our fans like it, but it's really hard to make a splash with all the noise going on in music. This EP, we got together with a label called Kobalt, they're super awesome. We were a little more methodical with putting it out and trying to get it into people's headphones. Now, the Spotify playlist is a thing. You've got to keep up with the times, it's not easy.

The chairman of a top London hospital trust has dramatically quit, in protest at the Government's “unrealistic” expectations for NHS funding.
Lord Kerslake said a fundamental review of the health service is needed to address a growing financial crisis.
The former head of the civil service, who resigned as chairman of King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London on Sunday, said the health service could not continue "staggering along" under the current funding levels.
He said a "proper review", potentially on a cross-party basis, was required to address the future of the NHS - and how to pay for it.
NHS Improvement branded the trust's financial performance "unacceptable" but Lord Kerslake insisted that savings had been made.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was "not enough understanding of the scale of the challenge that both King's and the NHS is currently facing".

Lord Kerslake said: "We face some here and now issues. I am deeply concerned about the position generally, actually, in London where most of the hospitals are struggling.
"But there is also a big issue about social care as well which got no additional funding in the Budget.
"And I think, deep down, what we need is a proper review, a cross-party review, I don't mind what it's called, that looks at what kind of NHS do we want, how much is it going to cost and then how are we going to pay for it.
"Unless we do that we are just going to carry on staggering along, kicking the can down the road and not really addressing the fundamental issue."
The crossbench peer, who has carried out some work for Labour, insisted that his decision to speak out was motivated by a "deep passion for the NHS" and was "nothing to do with party politics".
(Image: SWNS.com)
A spokeswoman for NHS Improvement said the financial performance at King's was "the worst in the NHS and continues to deteriorate".
"We are considering a range of actions, including entry to our financial special measures regime, which means King's will be subject to greater scrutiny and extra support from NHS Improvement.
"We respect Lord Kerslake's decision to step down and will replace him with a highly experienced new chair to take charge of the trust's position."
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: "This is embarrassing for the Government and is evidence from a heavily respected figure on the frontline that the Budget utterly failed to deliver for the NHS and that seven years of underfunding is impacting on patients in unacceptable ways."
A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "We know that King's NHS Foundation Trust faces huge financial challenges and we will support them to tackle these issues and continue to deliver high quality care for patients under a new chairman.
"We would like to thank Lord Kerslake for his service."
Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, described Lord Kerslake's decision as significant "not least because he has been at the heart of government".
He said that the Government has "enormously difficult decisions to make" and added: "But what is unarguable is that demand is growing beyond our capacity to meet it - and ironically the current constraints are slowing down our capacity to reform the way care is delivered.
"As a society we have to decide whether or not we are prepared to take a hard look at what will be needed, embrace reform and provide the resources needed to deliver it."

New Delhi: Senior IAS officer Pradeep Singh Kharola on Monday took charge as the chairman and managing director (CMD) of Air India. Kharola assumed charge from Rajiv Bansal.
A 1985-batch Karnataka cadre officer, Kharola would be steering the national carrier at a time when the government has started the process for its strategic disinvestment. He was the managing director of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd since February 2015.
Among others, Kharola has worked in various posts in Karnataka, including as the chairman of Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation Ltd. He has also served as principal secretary to the Karnataka chief minister.
As part of efforts to revive the fortunes of Air India—which is staying afloat on taxpayers' money—the government has decided on selling stake in the airline. The carrier, which has a debt burden of more than Rs50,000 crore, managed to eke out operational profit for the first time in a decade in 2015-16.
The drama. The loyalty. The speculation about who stays and who goes. The Trump administration has it all. And so did Donald Trump's run on The Apprentice.
The personality that made the show a hit is also what propelled Trump to the presidency. But as with his administration, Trump also stirred controversy on the set. A former producer tells the NPR podcast Embedded that at times Trump used "really unfathomably despicable words" while the cameras were rolling — remarks that have never been made public.
Of course, people weren't watching then for insight into how the show's star would eventually approach the presidency or what effect it would have on his public political image. But in retrospect, there are a handful of lessons that say something about the man now in the Oval Office.
1. Questionable language
In October 2016, just before the election, an Access Hollywood tape emerged of Trump using crude language about women, saying, "[W]hen you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." When that story broke, former Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt tweeted that there were "far worse" tapes from Trump's time on that show.
Pruitt says he does not have the tapes and has signed a nondisclosure agreement, but he tells NPR that the comments he was referring to were racist in nature and included remarks about African-Americans and Jews. Pruitt says Trump's language was not a reflection of the culture of the crew — that at times there would be an "audible gasp" from those who heard the comments.
A White House spokesperson called Pruitt's story "the same recycled and false attacks from over a year ago."
There have been multiple accusations of Trump publicly using inappropriate or offensive language. He started his campaign by referring to immigrants as "rapists." This summer after the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va., Trump was widely criticized for not immediately denouncing white supremacists and instead spreading blame to people who were counterprotesting the neo-Nazis and KKK members. Those comments follow a history of ambiguity on white nationalism, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has reported.
2. A businessman with baggage
The first time Trump appears in the pilot episode of The Apprentice, he's seated in the back of a black limousine, introducing himself directly to the camera.
"My name's Donald Trump," he begins, "and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York." He lists off his holdings: buildings, casinos, golf courses, model agencies and much more.
Then he briefly hints at his past financial challenges.
"But it wasn't always so easy. About 13 years ago I was seriously in trouble," he says, in reference to four bankruptcies involving his properties in Atlantic City and New York in 1991 and 1992.
"I was billions of dollars in debt," he continues. "But I fought back and I won, big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills. And I worked it all out. Now my company's bigger than it ever was — stronger than it ever was."
In all 14 episodes of The Apprentice's debut season, these 20 seconds are the only substantive acknowledgement of the rocky financial history some of Trump's businesses had faced. From then on, the show consistently paints Trump as a triumphant underdog, with his troubles squarely behind him.
"Donald Trump is an icon," contestant Kwame Jackson told the producers in the season finale. "He's someone who, when people said, 'You couldn't do it,' always got it done." That's a sentiment also echoed by Trump supporters during the campaign.
Multiple episodes were set at Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which he described on the show as "the No. 1 hotel in Atlantic City." Flattering shots of the exterior and interior portray the resort as thriving.
In fact, the Taj Mahal, along with other Trump casinos, would file for bankruptcy in late 2004, just months after The Apprentice debuted.
Still, Trump's business savvy was part of his pitch during the campaign, and many who voted for him looked forward to having an outsider perspective on the inside. Despite his bankruptcies, Trump largely maintained his image of success.
3. Ever the salesman
Every episode of the show centered around a task — a business-related contest between two teams. Who can make the most money selling lemonade on Wall Street? Managing the Times Square Planet Hollywood for a day? Fixing up and renting out an old apartment? The winning team, besides steering clear of a scolding from Trump inside his dimly lit boardroom, would receive a reward.
Sometimes these rewards were simply a chance to visit classic New York landmarks: a private tour of Yankee stadium or a boat trip around the Hudson Bay. But more often than not, the rewards also showcased and elevated Trump's wealth and business acumen.
There was the walk-through of the extravagant penthouse in Trump Tower where Trump and his then-girlfriend Melania, now wife and first lady, lived; the picnic at Trump's estate in Bedford, N.Y. ("where the richest people live," Trump narrates); the driving range at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. ("the best golf course in New York state"); the overnight stay at Trump's Taj Mahal casino ("you're staying in the most beautiful suite you've ever seen"); the jaunt to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort ("the No. 1 club anywhere as far as I'm concerned").
In Episode 9, one contestant's savvy business move earns him a reward of 10 minutes with Donald Trump. "You know, a lot of people would like that opportunity," Trump tells a visibly appreciative Nick Warnock.
Trump's financial ties have followed him to Washington, with watchdogs arguing for further separation from his businesses. Trump and his lawyers argue they have done enough by setting up a trust, rather than fully divesting as past presidents have done.
Even amid criticism of being too close to his businesses while in office, Trump has spent many weekends at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., and his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. His hotel in Washington, D.C., has raised concern about whether world leaders would spend money there to curry favor with the president. And Trump hasn't shied away from talking about his properties. Even during controversial remarks about Charlottesville, Trump took to the opportunity to mention his winery in the area.
4. Loyalty is paramount
It didn't take the president's unearthed conversations with former FBI Director James Comey to remind the public of how highly President Trump values loyalty. But the clues were also there in 2004, particularly during the firing of one contestant named Tammy Lee.
In the seventh episode, as Trump dissects the losing team's failure as they sit before him, Lee breaks with the rest of her team to bluntly blame the team leader for having done a poor job of negotiating. Trump questions the rest of the team about Lee's dissension, asking, "Was she honest or disloyal?"
The team and Trump agree Lee had not shown enough loyalty.
"Your disloyalty has been just terrible. ... I mean it is so obnoxious in this particular case," Trump tells Lee as the music swells, signaling he would soon deliver his signature sentence: "Tammy ... you're fired."
Comey has testified that the president asked for his "loyalty" and for him to end the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump denies ever asking for a loyalty pledge, but it has been clear that Trump does expect loyalty from his team — even if he does not always reciprocate.
5. Trump can stoke a fight, even between others
From the start, Trump was one of the executive producers of The Apprentice (even into his presidency). And, like any good reality television producer, he appeared to have a gift for identifying and, in some cases, amplifying squabbles between contestants.
Take a tense scene in the boardroom in Episode 6. Trump is interrogating the losing team, leading to the typical chain of recriminations. Controversial contestant Omarosa Manigault (now an aide to the president) begins by complimenting her teammate, Heidi Bressler, before also adding that when she first met Bressler, she didn't think she had much class.
"Do you think Omarosa has class?" Trump asks Bressler, looking for a response to her teammate's backhanded compliment. He adds, "If somebody said that about me, I wouldn't like her. I don't care what they do."
Trump then turns to another contestant, Jessie Connor: "Do you like Omarosa, the way she just talks to you? I mean do you like her?" Connor refuses to take the bait, instead trying to keep the peace by saying she does in fact like her teammate.
But Trump isn't finished sussing out the conflict.
"How can you like her, the way she's talking to you? You know she's got a very sharp edge," he says about Manigault. And on it goes.
The president has had his share of direct Twitter wars since taking office, but he also has a history of publicly stoking feuds between others.
During the campaign, Trump created divides to his advantage. He tried to create a chasm between Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas on one side and Marco Rubio of Florida and now-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. In October 2016, he reminded supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., how Hillary Clinton had wronged them, saying, "To the Bernie Sanders people, you got sold out." In September, following a wave of kneeling protests by professional sports players, the president sought to remind the public of what he perceived to be a newly forming divide between the NFL's athletes and its fans.
6. On ratings and popularity
Trump has never struggled with being known, which made the first season of The Apprentice a huge success. Instead, his challenge has been to be seen as "favorable."
The show's first season in 2004 was a game-changer for a network in trouble. NBC, which was just about to lose its blockbuster hit Friends, saw over 20 million viewers settle in each week to watch Trump preside over the fates of 16 young entrepreneurs vying for a job with his company, The Trump Organization.
Attracting 28 million viewers, the April 2004 season finale was the most popular show on television that week. According to opinion polls conducted by Gallup, when Trump flirted with a presidential run under the Reform Party ticket in 1999, the percentage of respondents who saw him as "favorable" declined precipitously: from 41 to 33 percent in less than a month. But in 2005, one year after The Apprentice debuted, Trump clocked in at 50 percent.
Trump had never before — and he would never again so far — eclipse the 50 percent mark in Gallup's polls. As of Oct. 5, nearly nine months into his presidency, Trump is at 39 percent. However, what has been a historically low approval rating for a first-term president recently stabilized.

Bristol City missed the chance to go equal second in the Championship on Friday evening as Bolton Wanderers edged a close affair at the Macron Stadium.
After the game head coach Lee Johnson bemoaned the two possible penalty decisions that could have gone the Robins' way, but was more damning about his side's conviction.
The former Barnsley and Oldham did pay credit to the opposition, too, however.
“I thought they deserved to win. I think, dare I say it, they wanted it more. I didn't think we started well – I thought we were a bit flicky, a bit posey, and didn't do the basics better then them,” he said.
“I think that led to Bolton being encouraged that they were well in the game. Ameobi was very good and caused us problems all night.
“I'm very disappointed. I can take being beat but I was disappointed with the manner of the defeat. And the way that we lacked heart tonight,” he explained in the post-match press conference.
The Bristol Post asked if – an example of this – Joe Bryan could have done more to stop Sammy Ameobi breaking from his own half to rifle in the match-winning goal.
“Absolutely. I think that's an understatement.”
And on the penalty decisions?
“I thought the first one was a definite. The second one [Flint] was a foul but you're never going to get that,” he said.
“But listen, it wasn't about the standard of the refereeing tonight because we can't legislate for that.
“What we can legislate for is our performance. And we haven't done enough to go and beat a resolute Bolton side,” he explained.
City will need to bounce back against Sunderland at Ashton Gate next weekend as the Robins continue their campaign for promotion.

A holiday rep suffered horrific burns in an acid attack after she was allegedly lured to a date on ­Tinder by her ex-boyfriend.
Ellie Chessell then received a ­threatening message as she lay in agony in her hospital bed.
The 29-year-old had the acid thrown over her two months after she split from Claudio Gouveia who she had lived with on the Portuguese island of Madeira.
TUI rep Ellie was attacked by a stranger as she was on her way to meet a man she met on Tinder called “Diogo” in the Algarve. She suffered 50% burns to her body.
(Image: Getty)
She later told police: “I thought at first the liquid was urine because it felt warm but I quickly realised it was acid because the heat became burning and I realised I had been caught in a trap set by my ex-boyfriend.”
But as she recovered, she received a message that read: “I'm looking forward to our next encounter. Like you said you stuck with me forever.”
Ellie had walked out on her boyfriend of two years and fled to the Algarve after he ­allegedly smashed her head against a wall during a row about money and his jealousy.
(Image: SOLARPIX.COM)
According to prosecution papers, police in the UK and Portugal were warned she was in danger at least a month before the attack last May. But little appears to have been done.
Ellie received the threat: “I will find you… you are going to die.”
Gouveia, 34, is also accused of sending a message to her parents in Newport, Isle of Wight, telling them: “I'm going to burn her face.”
The threats were so serious ­Hampshire police sent officers in the Algarve an alert that said: “He needs to be located to safeguard the victim.”
(Image: Daily Mirror)
Ellie also got messages begging her to go back to him. In one he wrote: “Why can't we start over in the Isle of Wight. A fresh start. Do you think that's better than start everything with someone else?”
But when Ellie did not reply, the message took a sinister turn.
One, dated April 3, read: “I'm going to find you and take your head off. You are a slut and you are going to die.”
(Image: SOLARPIX.COM)
Prosecutors claim he sent messages for two hours, adding: “You are going to make me do something silly. I'm going to take you with me if you don't reply.”
The court files claim Gouveia and alleged hitman Edmundo Helder Rodrigues Fonseca travelled from Madeira to the Algarve four days before the attack for a “recce”.
They also allege the Tinder profile set up in the name of “Diogo” vanished as Ellie was attacked.
Gouveia was arrested in Madeira on May 29 and has been in custody ever since.
Fonseca, 44, was tracked down to Uganda where he is in jail on heroin charges. It is believed prosecutors are awaiting for his extradition before putting the pair on trial.
Ellie is back in the UK having follow-up treatment for her burns and the post-traumatic stress she suffered.
In the court papers she says: “I had a career with TUI that I enjoyed and fully expected to continue in this role.
“This has now been put on hold pending my complete recovery.”
Owner Of Danish Submarine Held On Murder Charges
Police in Denmark are investigating the disappearance of a Swedish journalist, who had been on an amateur-built submarine before it sank. The sub's owner has been charged in the journalist's death.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
A mystery has been unfolding in Copenhagen over the weekend. And it has all the elements of a Hollywood thriller - an inventor and his homemade submarine, a young journalist and, allegedly, a murder. Sidsel Overgaard joins us now from Denmark to talk about what's been going on. Sidsel, who are the people at the center of this mystery?
SIDSEL OVERGAARD, BYLINE: So the people that you just alluded to there are Peter Madsen and Kim Wall. We'll start with Peter Madsen. He's a 46-year-old self-described inventor-entrepreneur. And he's known here in Denmark as Rocket Madsen. And you might guess from that name that he's something of a character. He's best known for trying to design and send amateur-built rockets into space. You can think of him maybe as a wannabe Elon Musk or Richard Branson on a much smaller scale. But he has that anything-is-possible attitude that anyone trying to get into space would have to have and a certain willingness to take risk.
MARTIN: Yeah.
OVERGAARD: In addition to his work with rockets, though, he's also built three submarines. And the latest of those is what's at the scene - is the scene for this story. It's called the UC3 Nautilus. It's about 60 feet long. It's one of the biggest homemade submarines in the world. It was finished in 2008. But after an accident in 2010, it's been dry docked for six years while he and his team of mostly volunteers have been working to fix it. But it was finally put back in the water this spring...
MARTIN: OK.
OVERGAARD: ...Which brings us to Kim Wall, who's a 30-year-old Swedish journalist who was reportedly writing an article about Madsen and Nautilus, which is why she set sail with him on Thursday. We don't know what the angle of her story was beyond that.
MARTIN: OK. So they set off on Thursday. And then what happened?
OVERGAARD: Well, they set sail from Copenhagen Harbor and were last seen together by a boater about an hour and a half later. Then in the middle of the night, Wall's boyfriend called authorities to say that he hadn't been able to get in touch with her. That launched this whole search-and-rescue operation. But there was no sign of the submarine until the next morning, when it was spotted south of where it had set sail. Madsen made contact and said he'd had technical problems but was going to try to sail the submarine to harbor.
But then half an hour later, it suddenly sank - as in 30 seconds, and it was underwater. And he was rescued in a private boat. But there was no sign of Wall. The search for that submarine was already a big story because of Rocket Madsen. But the disappearance of Wall is what's made this front-page news in Denmark and Sweden for a few days now. Initially, Madsen claimed to have dropped her off back in Copenhagen the night before. Police are now saying his story has changed, but they aren't revealing any details about how it's changed.
MARTIN: But he has been charged with killing her?
OVERGAARD: Yes. And the police announced the charge already on Friday evening just hours after the sub sank. In court on Saturday, Madsen said he was not guilty. That hearing was held behind closed doors, which is a big part of the reason that this case remains so mysterious. On Sunday morning, the police said they'd recovered the submarine, and there was no body inside. But they had reason to believe that Nautilus had been intentionally sunk.
MARTIN: Wow. OK. So if this does turn out to be a homicide, any idea of motive?
OVERGAARD: Well, we don't know. But, of course, with a case this riveting, there's plenty of public speculation. I've seen a couple of tweets where people suggest this is some kind of big PR stunt. Other people think he's actually been accused much too quickly and that it may not be justified. Mostly, there's just a lot of people wondering what happened on the submarine. You know, she was a journalist. Did she have dirt on him? And what was so sensitive that that hearing on Saturday had to happen behind closed doors. It's said that some of the information could've been offensive to the victim's family, but we don't know what that could be.
MARTIN: All right. Reporter Sidsel Overgaard reporting from Denmark - thanks so much, Sidsel.
OVERGAARD: Thank you.

The Central Atlanta Progress/Atlanta Downtown Improvement District's efforts to create the Downtown Atlanta Master Plan are in full swing and its second Open House is set for June 14 at the Rialto Center from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The Downtown Atlanta Master Plan is the primary vision-setting and policy-directing strategy to lead the ongoing evolution of downtown Atlanta for the next 15 years. In addition to establishing priorities for the center city's future land use, transportation network, park and open spaces and major development projects, the Plan is expected to guide real estate and infrastructure investments and planning and economic development activities.
Building upon the input received at the first Open House in March, the upcoming drop-in event will feature interactive stations where attendees can explore and provide input on proposed draft strategies for the future of downtown. As well, participants will be able to see how community input gathered via prior events, an online survey, and other outreach efforts have translated into policy strategies and design concepts that have the potential to become components of the finalized Master Plan.
The Plan replaces the Imagine Downtown 2.0 initiative and will become the new Livable Centers Initiative, or LCI, community plan, recognized by the Atlanta Regional Commission. It is being executed by a team of planners, engineers and designers in three components that will result in one comprehensive and overarching vision document to be adopted by the City of Atlanta later this year.
Topics to be covered during the Open House include:
A Vision for Downtown – Review the first draft of our vision statement. Did we get it right? Is this a vision that you want to see become reality?
Streets – Each street is different and serves different needs. How should specific Downtown streets be designed?
Development – Downtown needs more people to support more retail and services. How should Downtown evolve as a collection of neighborhoods? How should residential development take form in Downtown?
Open Space – Downtown has unique environmental needs. How can we best bring the forest back into the City? Help us prioritize locations and envision public open spaces.
Art / Culture / Preservation / Activation – Downtown is Atlanta's most historic area, rich with arts and culture. How can we tell the stories of Downtown's past and evolving present within the public realm?
Key Sites – Downtown has some very important sites. You get to be the planner – what should happen at places like Five Points? The Civic Center? Or just a small vacant lot?
Central Atlanta Progress, Inc., is a Downtown business association with approximately 240 members. Its mission is to champion a vibrant community with strong leadership and sustainable infrastructure that is safe, livable, diverse, economically viable, accessible, clean, hospitable and entertaining. The Atlanta Downtown Improvement District is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, charitable corporation created by CAP to make Downtown safer, cleaner and more hospitable.

Leicester City's underwhelming season continued on Monday as they were held to a 0-0 draw at Middlesbrough that did little for either side's hopes of avoiding Premier League relegation.
With Jamie Vardy completing his three-game suspension and Riyad Mahrez again disappointing, Leicester lacked a cutting edge and it was Boro who came closest to taking all three points at the Riverside Stadium.
The result inched both sides a point further clear of the bottom three, but the threat of relegation will continue to stalk them when they return to league action after next weekend's FA Cup third-round fixtures.
Champions Leicester have now gone 12 away games without victory in the Premier League, stretching back to the 2-0 win at Sunderland last April that nudged them closer to their fairytale title win.
With both teams having played on New Year's Eve — Leicester edging West Ham United 1-0, Boro cruelly beaten 2-1 at Manchester United — they each made five changes to their starting XIs.
Leicester, for whom Islam Slimani was absent with a fever, made the more lively start.
Shinji Okazaki could not make anything of Leonardo Ulloa's knock-down from Mahrez's free-kick, while Christian Fuchs drilled wide from the edge of the box.
But as the game wore on, Boro began to take control, with Adama Traore to the fore.
The former Barcelona winger had a penalty shout turned down in the 18th minute when he appeared to be impeded by Robert Huth right on the edge of the Leicester box.
Moments later the 20-year-old sped to the byline on the right and cut the ball back for Marten de Roon, who shot over.
Antonio Barragan returned from suspension for Boro, but he limped off clutching his hamstring in the 34th minute, with George Friend coming on.
Another Boro full-back caught the eye shortly before half-time, Fabio da Silva sliding in brilliantly to prevent Mahrez taking aim from Okazaki's through ball.
Left-back Friend emerged as an improbable most likely source of a goal in the second half.
He warmed Kasper Schmeichel's palms from 25 yards and then cut in from the right, only to skew his shot wide.
He also curled an inviting cross into the box from the left, but Adam Forshaw could not make telling contact.
All Leicester mustered in response was an Ulloa header that Brad Guzan saved comfortably.
Visiting manager Claudio Ranieri took decisive action by sending on Ahmed Musa in place of Mahrez, who produced another low-key display in his last game before departing for the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria.
But it was Boro who continued to push, Gaston Ramirez squandering a golden chance to snatch victory when he lashed wide following a tame clearance by Wes Morgan.

BEL-NOR, MO (KPLR) – The image of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un with a questionable caption hanging on a professor's office door had some University of Missouri St. Louis students upset.
A student who snapped a picture of the display and emailed it to Fox 2 earlier this week did not want to be identified.
The caption is printed on the North Korean leader's image as 'l no longer the craziest leader!'
The student said the image posted on the professor's door goes beyond than just being able to exercise their first amendment right.
The student said the professor teaches science courses and not politics.
"It's offensive because it's somebody else's culture because the message is political in nature," the student said. "It's not about freedom of speech, it's about the right time and the right place."
But some other students speaking with Fox 2 said that anyone should be able to exercise their first amendment right, even if it's on a college campus.
"As long as it does not offend anybody," said business student, Annia Mbaloe, "but if somebody finds it offensive, I don't know, will it harm someone?"
Meanwhile, the student who contacted Fox 2 said they fear that if anyone knew they were speaking out about their concern regarding the photo, the academic consequences could be severe.
"I can't say anything to anyone because of the outcry from other students or maybe other professors and professors that are determining my grade," the student said.
That's why the student says, UMSL is not the kind of institution they want to continue their education with.
"I've been out cast to the point where I am no longer going to be a student after this semester, I am leaving," the student said, "I don't expect anything to be done to be honest, I just think taxpayers have the right to know where their tax money is going."
Fox 2 reached out to the university for a comment in regards to the student's concern.
Robert Samples, the Associate Vice Chancellor for Communications said that the university was not aware of the alleged incident until our inquiry.
In an email statement Samples said:
"The University of Missouri–St. Louis is committed to maintaining a climate where all students, faculty, staff and visitors can explore their interests, refine their talents and flourish.
Members of the UMSL community are encouraged to engage in civil and constructive discourse, reasoned thought and sustained dialogue in an environment that respects diversity and inclusion.
We ask that people contact the campus Title IX coordinator, Office of Human Resources, Office of the Provost or Office of Student Affairs should they encounter an issue which they believe violates state, federal or university policy. The matter will be investigated."
A30-year-old aviation professional had been married for less than a year when she discovered that her 34-year-old husband, a marketing executive, was addicted to alcohol. There were days when he would find it hard to leave the bed, sometimes soiling the sheets, alternating between violent and remorseful behaviour. The aviation professional sought counselling and eventually got her husband enrolled in a de-addiction programme.
According to Prevalence Of Drug Abuse In India Through A National Household Survey, a study published in 2015 in the International Journal Of Current Science, substance abuse (which includes alcohol, tobacco, drugs and dependence on any addictive substance) was acknowledged as one of the foremost public health problems in India, responsible for many deaths that could have been prevented.
In Substance Use And Addiction Research In India, published in the Indian Journal Of Psychiatry in January 2010, tobacco abuse was identified as highest among males in the age group of 41-50. Alcohol was the second most widely abused substance, followed by cannabis and opioids.
These days, of course, addictive behaviour can extend beyond these well-known vices. In addition to gambling, the use of inhalants and porn addiction, the internet too can be a threat, with recent reports of internet de-addiction centres cropping up in Delhi and Bengaluru.
“Alcohol, cannabis still form the bulk of our cases,” says Rohann Bokdawala, consultant neuro-psychiatrist at the Masina Hospital in Mumbai. “However, nowadays, dependence on newer designer drugs like MDMA, MCAT is common. Basically, consumption of anything in excess which disrupts daily routine and causes social and occupational impairment is addictive behaviour.”
Understanding Addiction
“It is critical to understand what fuels addiction,” says M. Suresh Kumar, director and consultant psychiatrist at Psymed Hospital and senior consultant psychiatrist, department of neurosciences, Voluntary Health Services, Chennai. “Addiction is a brain disorder and not a personality flaw. However, besides the addict, addictive behaviour causes great pain to family members.” In the Indian context, the problem increases manifold since addictions tend to be stigmatized, with addicts being seen as morally flawed and lacking in willpower. “Many ‘rehabilitation' centres in India are dehumanizing, merely locking up patients instead of treating the root cause of addiction in a scientific way,” says Dr Kumar.
The root cause, experts say, is the irresistible urge to indulge in behaviour or abuse a substance that triggers the release of dopamine, the neurochemical that is associated with intense pleasure and reward, in our brains. “Once this pattern of behaviour (trigger and reward) is established, it is hard to stop. More abuse creates critical changes in neural pathways,” says R. Dheep, a consultant psychiatrist at Apollo Specialty Hospitals, Madurai, de-addiction specialist and founder of the Madurai-based TOPKIDS counselling and personality development centre.
Such behaviour, in fact, could well be genetic. “It is 10-40% genetic in nature and the rest depends on environment and circumstances,” says Dr Bokdawala. “Addicts know fully well the damage they are doing to themselves, and yet procuring the substance becomes the main focal point of their existence. Over a period of time, they develop a tolerance to the substances they abuse.” Higher quantities of the substance are then required to attain the same level of euphoria.
Treatment options
For years, abstinence (whether it worked or not) was considered the only treatment for addictive behaviour. But treatments are now evolving.
Chemical detoxification
Chemical detoxification involves the use of prescribed medication to keep substance abuse at bay. In the 1920s, chronic alcoholics were first given Disulfiram, a medication that produced extreme sensitivity to ethanol, the key intoxicating agent found in all liquor. “This worked because it produced, almost immediately, the extreme effects of a hangover whenever the patient consumed alcohol after taking the medication,” says Dr Dheep.
The drug would induce severe headaches, nausea and purging, dizziness, even lead to loss of consciousness if the patient drank after taking it. So alcoholics were often given cards that would identify them as Disulfiram users to hospital staff. “Initially, when Disulfiram was used, it was in doses that were much higher than what we see today,” says Dr Dheep.
“It was employed as a deterrent against drinking but the risk of collapse made doctors cautious about prescribing it. Eventually it was tapered down, but today, there are far more sophisticated neurological drugs that act on the brain. These minimize cravings that fuel all addictive behaviour. However, because Disulfiram is an inexpensive therapy, it is still in use in many government hospitals across the country,” he says.
Medication should, however, be seen at best as a short-term solution, given the side effects involved. For a lasting cure, psychiatrists are now turning their attention to habits that foster the addiction in the first place.
Identifying key triggers, changing habits
Habits play a key role in addictive behaviour. Sometimes, then, all it takes to end addiction is a change in long-term habits, some of which a person may not even be aware of. “For instance, if you're an alcoholic and you pass a liquor shop on your route to work or go to parties that are overflowing with cocktails, there will be a moment when you won't be able to resist temptation. We analyse a patient's personal habits, so we can see how we can help eliminate these triggers that would be feeding their addiction,” says Dr Dheep.
An analysis of habits works best for alcohol and tobacco addictions, which are triggered by repetitive/cyclical behavioural patterns.
Substitution therapy
Opioids are drugs that act on the nervous system to relieve pain. “When treating a person addicted to opioids, psychological distress is a common issue, and it needs to be addressed,” says Dr Kumar. “In many cases, they use (and abuse) these drugs to manage chronic pain and relapse is very commonly seen in this group. In fact, 95% of the patients will relapse even after prolonged treatment and this can cause great trauma for families.
“In cases like this, abstinence is not recommended, as we would for alcohol or tobacco. We replace illicit drugs with certain prescription medication that has the same effects but which, over time, can be tapered and are not as addictive,” he adds. This treatment is called substitution therapy.
Family counselling and rehabilitation
“A very important aspect in dealing with de-addiction is to involve the family as much as possible and teach them how to handle the patient,” says Dr Bokdawala. The burden on the caregiver, when dealing with any kind of addiction can be immense, especially since relapse is so common.
“Evidence over the past five decades shows that nearly 80% of patients worldwide relapse in the first year. This may sound very disheartening but the numbers are improving.” Dr Bokdawala.
“If you have a family history of addiction, it helps to take precautions,” says Dr Kumar. This is because most addictive behaviour starts young, before the age of 18. “Exposing the brain to substance abuse at a very young age destroys the protective myelin sheath in the nerves and makes one vulnerable to neurological disorders.”
A holistic approach is needed, say experts. “Finding better, positive ways to manage stress right from a young age is critical,” says Dr Dheep. “Encourage children to spend more time engaged in activity outdoors—a bicycle ride, swimming, trekking. Teach them to embrace the simple joys of living to seek relief instead.”

Ride Hailing In Rural America: Like Uber With A Neighborly Feel
Enlarge this image toggle caption M.L. Schultze/WKSU M.L. Schultze/WKSU
It's easy enough for people who live in cities to hail a ride, either from a taxi or a service like Uber or Lyft. There's plenty of demand, and plenty of drivers. A startup is trying to bring a similar service to rural America, but it has required some creative thinking.
The town of Van Wert sits on the western edge of Ohio. It's a stretch of flat farm country punctuated with grain silos and a stone castle that's listed as the nation's first county public library.
It doesn't seem like the first place a ride-hailing service would likely come. But Erica Petrie says maybe that's a mistake.
Petrie is the mobility manager of the seven-county Area Agency on Aging. Her job is to find transportation options in Van Wert, which has no buses, one cab and a lot of needs.
"The quick turnaround needs: 'Can someone help me get to the doctor?' We see short-term needs: 'Normally I'm able to drive, but my car's in the shop,' " she says.
So Petrie helped recruit Liberty Mobility Now to Van Wert. The startup began in Nebraska about two years ago and has expanded to Texas and Ohio. It's also on its way to Colorado.
Founder Valerie Lefler grew up on a dairy farm and worked on rural transportation issues at the University of Nebraska. She created Liberty as a business, but she talks about it as a mission — one requiring drivers to do more than leave customers at the door.
"We really look for folks who are altruistic, that would want to do this anyway because that's what they would do for their best friend or their own mother," Lefler says.
One of those people is Shelia Mendoza, whose mission in life, she says, is to be a grandma.
Mendoza has worked for a dry cleaner and at a Wal-Mart. She's sold insurance, made RV cabinets and briefly ran Shelia's Cornucopia Cove. And when Liberty came to Van Wert two months ago, she was one of about a dozen drivers recruited and trained.
The grandmother of 17 and self-described talker was a natural. That's because while part of Liberty's model is built on an app designed to work in rural geographies, much more of it is built on relationships.
For example, Mendoza developed a relationship with her first customer who'd lost his license but found a job: the midnight shift at a meat processing plant. A county agency was willing to cover transportation costs for a few weeks until he could get his license back.
"I always had him there five to 10 minutes early," Mendoza says. "We would stop and get coffee sometimes ... before he would go to work. Once in a while he paid for mine."
Since he regained his license, things have slowed down for Mendoza.
"I was happy he got his car, I was happy he got his license. He's a better person for that because I know he hated getting hauled around by an old lady," she says and laughs.
She's hoping business will pick up, and her hopes rest with a lower-tech option Liberty is launching: a call center for those who don't or can't use an app.
"I've heard a lot of people say, 'Well, I don't want anything like that on my phone; I don't have room,' " she says.
Scott Bogren of the Community Transportation Association of America, which specializes in smaller and rural transportation issues, says the call center shows that Liberty understands its target community.
"The adult children of these seniors who can book rides for mom — they're going to use an online service," he says. "And combine that with the ability for mom to call in and talk to somebody that she can get to know — there's the sweet spot."
Because of chronic transportation needs, Liberty is partnering with United Ways, hospitals, health departments and other social service agencies.
Rides cost $1.25 to book and $1 per mile. The fees are a small fraction of what the cabby charges, but Liberty says it will also make referrals if the taxi's a better fit.
Petrie says all of that captures the spirit of the area.
"I like that the drivers are from the communities," she says. "People are I think more polite, more neighborly. That's just what is going to fit here."
Liberty Mobility is hoping to find similar fits all across America.

Four of the eight third-placed Champions League finishers will be seeded for the last-32 draw which takes place on Monday and these seeds will face either a Europa League group runner-up or unseeded Champions League dropout.
As a Europa League group stage winner, Arsenal know they will not face one of these seeded sides, so will avoid Atletico Madrid, CSKA Moscow, RB Leipzig and Sporting Lisbon.
However, they could face Borussia Dortmund, Celtic, Napoli or Spartak Moscow, who join from the Europa League's big brother.

An ordinance banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone younger than 21 has been stalled from taking effect in Topeka.
The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Shawnee County District Court Judge Franklin Theis is weighing legal arguments after a hearing Thursday. The law increasing the minimum age to buy tobacco products was slated to take effect last month but a business, Vape Bar and Puffs ‘n' Stuff, sued, asking for a temporary injunction.
Attorney R.E. “Tuck” Duncan says state lawmakers should be the ultimate authority on such laws. At least 17 cities or counties in Kansas have so-called “Tobacco 21” ordinances. Several state legislatures also have passed laws.
Theis ordered attorneys on both sides to file additional briefs by next week, but didn't indicate when he would rule.
In the run-up to the Buenos Aires ministerial meeting, World Trade Organization director general Roberto Azevedo had assured members that there will be no green room meetings of select countries and everything will be decided in open-ended sessions. Photo: Reuters
The more things change at a ministerial meeting the more they to remain same and Buenos Aires is no exception to this rule. Closed-door green room meetings among select countries are being brought back all over again, according to a trade minister who asked not to be identified.
In the run-up to the Buenos Aires ministerial meeting, World Trade Organization director general Roberto Azevedo had assured members that there will be no green room meetings of select countries and everything will be decided in open-ended sessions. Azevedo's promise to do away with the green room meetings—in which heads of delegation seek consensus informally under the chairmanship of the Director-General—stemmed from growing opposition to such meetings from a large majority of African countries who said they were excluded from the green room process, said an African trade minister.
But, the first green room meeting of six countries—the US, European Union, China, India, Brazil, and Australia—was set to take place on agriculture on Monday, convened by the facilitator for agriculture outcomes Amina Mohamed, the Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for foreign affairs.
The meeting, according to a trade minister who asked not to be named, was being convened because of Brazil's demand for linking an outcome on domestic support with the permanent solution for public stockholding programs for food security.
Brazil wants a ‘payment' for the permanent solution for public stockholding programs under the controversial slogan of parity between three agricultural issues—the permanent solution for public stockholding programs for food security, an outcome on overall trade-distorting support, and cotton—according to a South American trade official.
The EU and Australia are supporting Brazil's demand, the South American trade official said. “Out of six members, three—Brazil, Australia and the EU—support the linkage between domestic support and the permanent solution,” the source added.
While the US is expected to remain silent during the meeting, China and India are expected to reject any attempt to link domestic support and the permanent solution for public stockholding programs for food security, according to people will be participating in the green room meeting.
China and India have called for the elimination of the aggregate measurement of support (AMS), the most trade-distorting domestic support in industrialized countries, as a prerequisite for starting work on the domestic support. The EU, Brazil and Australia had rejected the China-India demand.
In a separate development, a large majority of developing countries are expected to reject a proposal for nominating a facilitator for Investment Facilitation which is being pushed hard by Argentina, China, and 30 other countries. The proponents for investment facilitation are seeking “structured discussions” to develop a multilateral framework on investment facilitation.
Argentina, which has been coordinating the informal group on investment facilitation and development, yesterday issued a report explaining the background for the demand to have structured discussions for identifying and developing elements of a framework for facilitating foreign direct investments.
The informal group which includes China, Korea, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan and Qatar wants the structured discussions to focus on the following themes: (a) improving regulatory transparency and predictability, (b) streamlining and speeding up administrative procedures, (c) enhancing international cooperation and addressing the needs of developing members and (d) other investment facilitation-related issues.
The sponsors maintained that “the right of members to regulate in order to meet their policy objectives shall be an integral part of the framework.” They maintained that “the framework shall also be designed to be flexible, adaptable, and responsive to the evolving investment facilitation priorities of Members.”
But India and a large majority of developing countries are going to reject the proposal for appointing a facilitator for investment facilitation, an Indian official said. India repeatedly opposed any discussion on investment facilitation at the WTO saying it is not an issue of the WTO's mandate and that it cannot be discussed without first completing work on the unresolved Doha Development Agenda issues, according to people familiar with India's stand.
Asus has revealed a new motherboard specifically designed for cryptocurrency miners who need lots of GPU power, with the mobo being capable of supporting no less than 20 graphics cards.
The H370 Mining Master motherboard (with an LGA 1151 CPU socket) follows up on the previous B250 Mining Expert board, and makes a number of refinements aside from the sheer amount of graphics cards you can plug into the thing (although admittedly, it's only one more card than its predecessor, as the B250 supported 19 GPUs).
It replaces the B250's PCIe x1 slots with vertical PCIe-over-USB ports that allow for USB riser cables to be plugged directly into the ATX motherboard. In other words, this connection is a sturdier method than using a PCIe card (as was required with the B250). And by using fewer parts, there's less chance of issues occurring, so you should see better overall reliability in your mining PC.
Furthermore, Asus has introduced a suite of diagnostic utilities to help keep the mining rig running smoothly. Features incorporated include GPU State Detection, which scans the system at boot to look for any potential problems with connected graphics cards.
Debug disco
Asus also notes that the on-board diagnostics are complemented by individual debug LEDs that light up when issues are encountered, showing at a glance which components are having trouble.
Finally, the H370 also benefits from a ‘mining mode' which comprises of various UEFI tweaks to ensure that some mining-related settings are optimally adjusted out of the box, saving the user the trouble of having to manually do this themselves.
Asus didn't reveal any information concerning the price or availability of the new motherboard, but hopefully we'll hear some details along those lines soon. The previous B250 currently retails at around £160 or $140 online.
Canara Bank Limited CEO Rakesh Sharma said the bank's gross NPA ratio stood at 10.38%, down sequentially from 10.51% as on September 2017. Photo: Mint
Bengaluru: Canara Bank Limited net profit plunged 61% to Rs126 crore in its third quarter financial results ended 31 December, 2017, due to higher provisions for Non Performing Assets (NPAs).
The net profit stood at Rs126 crore for the quarter ended 31 December compared with Rs322 crore a year ago, the bank said.
“The net profit has declined to 61%, mainly because of ageing provision on the treasury. Hence we had to make Rs74 crore provision on treasury bonds which affected decline in profits,” Canara Bank Limited managing director and CEO Rakesh Sharma told reporters.
“However, it is only a provision. Let us see how the yields move in the next quarter. Accordingly, we will take a view to make adjustments,” he told PTI after announcing the results in Bengaluru.
Sharma said the gross NPA ratio stood at 10.38%, down sequentially from 10.51% as on September 2017, while net NPA stood at 6.78%, down sequentially from 7.02% as at September 2017.
The net interest margin improved to 2.64% domestically and 2.39% globally, he added. The cost of deposits came down by a healthy 72 bps to 5.59% from 6.31%, Sharma said.
He also said net interest income growth of 52.4% and 11.29% growth in non-interest income, excluding trading profits significantly shielded them from unexpected quarter-end surge in bond yields and resultant market-to-market provisions.
The banks strenuous efforts for recovery has resulted in improved recovery under stressed assets,especially written off assets, thereby improving the bank's non-interest income, he said.

Two men who allegedly murdered Raymond Mhlaba council's speaker Thozama Njobe are to appear at the Fort Beaufort Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The 47-year-old Njobe was killed in a hail of bullets in Fort Beaufort in July while she and her colleague Mandla Makeleni were driving from a gathering in New Town.
A second suspect was arrested last Monday while was being treated for stab wounds at Cecilia Makhiwane Hospital.
It is reported that Njobe received death threats before she was gunned down.
Her death has left the Fort Beaufort community and ANC shocked.
It is believed that her death might be related to her fight against corruption within the Raymond Mhlaba Municipality.
The two suspects were arrested in Mdantsane near East London and they will appear in court today for their bail application.

England's summer trial by spin began in earnest as India's IPL kings dished out a hiding at an Old Trafford full of support.
And they didn't even need Virat Kohli to do the damage with the bat as KL Rahul grabbed 101 not out in the win by eight wickets with ten balls to spare – a hiding in T20 terms.
Worryingly it was spinner Kuldeep Yadav who started the rot with a sensational return of 5-24 from his four overs as England's phobia against spin reared its head yet again.
“They played well and it wasn't our day today,” said skipper Eoin Morgan.
“It was a game of fine margins and we need to be better.”

On a dry sun baked pitch that was taking turn, England's batsmen would have had a better chance of picking their noses with their gloves on than which way the ball was turning.
The left-arm wrist spinner left England's batsmen utterly clueless as he bamboozled them one by one, making two of the very best, Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root look like novices.
They both faced one ball and they were both stumped by MS Dhoni's fast hands, even if Root could have got back.
“He's a very good bowler,” added Morgan. “And is going to be a very big threat for us in this series and we need to be better about the way we go about our business.

“We'll assess how we play him and we need to play him better in the next game, but when the wicket is that good you need to take attacking options.”
If it wasn't for Jos Buttler and his purple patch of form that brought him 69 from 46 balls, this game would have been an even greater embarrassment for the home side, and it is fair to say that he likes his 'home' ground.
The Lancashire man rarely gets to play here for his county and hasn't done since the start of September last year, but in his two games here for England this summer he has made 179 runs and shown the rest of the top order how to bat.
Buttler's first scoring shot was a scoop over the keeper's head for four and he continued in that same swashbuckling style until he was out.

He added 50 in double quick time with Jason Roy, but once their partnership was broken he was forced to watch from the other end as his teammates spectacularly failed to deal with India's spin threat.
And to think that Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will not get to flex their spinning fingers until the Test series.
Where England's batsmen spluttered, the Indians purred as they took Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali apart as if it were the easiest thing in the world to do.
ALLEN (WBAP/KLIF News) – A home in Allen caught fire this morning after it was struck by lightning brought on by Monday morning's storms.
Parker Fire Chief Mike Sheff said it was said it was a one-alarm fire at the house on Glenn Meadows Drive and it resulted in a total loss.
“When crews first arrived, we had fire showing through the roof. We confirmed that everyone was out of the house at which point we went on what we called on the defensive. It was too dangerous to put out the fire inside the house,” he said.
Chief Sheff said fires like these are not unheard of. He said homes in Northern Collin County have been struck by lightning in the past and suggested that homeowners take preventative measures.
“They may want to consider lightning rods. Whether or not it would have changed the situation here I don't know,” said Sheff.
He said larger homes like the one that was destroyed today have a tendency to catch fire when lightning strikes due to large, open attic spaces.
It took the help from five local fire departments to help put out the blaze.

(WTNH) — A senior at Wake Hill who is from Durham is setting out to help the chronically ill in this country.
Jake Teitelbaum has founded the Resilience Project. Socks are designed with the help of the patients. They put their own spin on them. They are fun and colorful.
Those socks are then sold. The patients get half of the net proceeds to help offset their medical bills.
This idea came to Teitelbaum as he was undergoing treatment for Refractory Hodgkins Lymphoma in 2015. He was given hospital socks to wear that reminded him how sick he was as he recovered from his stem cell transplant. His road to recovery was tough.
“There's one day in particular I felt completely wiped and i'm in the bathroom and I find my eyes in the mirror. My eyes are really heavy, my cheeks are way too prominent and I'm the most pathetic version of myself I've ever seen. I looked down and I'm still wearing the most absurd pair of socks I own. In that moment and as foreign as I felt in my own body, those socks helped remind me who I was, who I wanted to be,” Teitelbaum said.
“I remember going in for my transplant and getting those socks for the fifth time in six months or so and they stood out to me because they represented what was to come. Those socks were the indicator of the chemotherapy, that chemotherapy that would tear my body apart. The socks represented the isolation. They were the epitome of that experience so when I went in, I made a point, this tiny rebellion, but it was wearing my own socks, he said.
“Each design represents some aspect of their life.”
“For Lily, she's a huge Owls fan and from day one when she was diagnosed, she had a stuffed animal with her, a stuffed owl. For her, it became the symbol of resilience,” he said.
Teitelbaum has been in remission since October of 2016 and will graduate next month. Then he says it will be full speed ahead on his Resilience Project to build his company as big as he can to help others.

For the first time out, the Rangers' new-look power play was pretty impressive. In fact, Mika Zibanejad scored twice with the man-advantage in the first period Thursday night.
But their defense was exposed numerous times by the quick transition offense of the Colorado Avalanche, who beat the Rangers in the season opener at Madison Square Garden, 4-2, as Semyon Varlamov, with 37 saves, outplayed Henrik Lundqvist in the nets.
Kevin Shattenkirk had an assist in his Rangers debut but was a minus-3 along with defense partner Ryan McDonagh.
Coach Alain Vigneault knew the Rangers would be a little unsettled, mentioning on Wednesday that it would take “10 to 20 games” to sort out roles and the roster. That timeline may have to be shortened.
Colorado was the worst team in the NHL last season and was beaten twice by the Rangers by a combined score of 10-4. It doesn't get any easier for the Rangers, who will visit Toronto on Saturday. The swift and talented Maple Leafs scored seven goals on Wednesday.
Despite showing a lot of energy, the Rangers fell behind in the first period. Matt Duchene, the subject of trade rumors, knocked a rebound past Lundqvist at 5:29. The Avalanche followed that on the power play at 10:53 when Mikko Rantanen beat Lundqvist high to the glove side off a cross-ice pass from Nathan MacKinnon through Jimmy Vesey.

Lundqvist, who is 20 pounds lighter than the heaviest he has been in his career, made his 12th consecutive start in an opener.
The Rangers fell behind 3-2 on a late second-period goal by Tyson Barrie, who was being chased by Pavel Buchnevich and beat Lundqvist. The chasing was a familiar sight through two periods as the Rangers continually had forwards trapped in the offensive zone.
Shattenkirk, who assisted on a power-play goal in the first period, said he was stung by the loss but thought “we did a great job of sustaining pressure, but when we turned the puck over, the problem we had was when our guy tried to force a play. Sometimes we [the defense] have to stay back and be more patient.”
Said Lundqvist: “Their speed and transition game, that's where they really hurt us, in the odd-man rushes. In the third, we definitely had our chances to tie.”
Zibanejad, who admits to having confidence problems when he battles a scoring slump, was the best Ranger on the ice. He finished with eight shots, and a couple of Grade-A chances were denied by Varlamov. Zibanejad also won 16 of 24 faceoffs.
When Derek Stepan was traded to Arizona on the eve of the NHL Draft in June, the immediate question was whether Zibanejad, the 24-year-old who had his first Rangers season undermined by a broken leg, could handle being a No. 1 pivot. So far, so good.
On Thursday, Zibanejad, who missed some time in the preseason with a flu bug, looked healthy and determined, scoring twice in 2:30 late in the first, one on a wrister from in front and the other a sizzling one-timer from the left circle.
Lundqvist was pulled for an extra skater with 1:30 to play, and although the Rangers worked on the six-on-five format during recent practices, it didn't click. Gabriel Landeskog scored into the empty net with three seconds left to seal it.
“We were working pucks back and making the most of our chances,'' Zibanejad said. “I think we created some good momentum from it. We just have to take it a step further and score one when we really need it.”
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — After deciding not to play for the French national team this summer, Hornets guard Nic Batum has apparently lost the support of some countrymen.
Batum said Friday that some fans in his native France are celebrating his recent injury and taunting him on social media.
Batum had played for the French team each year since he was a teenager, but passed on the experience this summer to instead prepare for Charlotte's season. Now, he'll miss at least six to eight weeks with a torn ligament in his left elbow.
"I know (some) people in France are happy about it; that's the sad part," Batum said. "Really, for real. I got on stuff and people are happy like I deserve it. ... Trust me, I get those reactions on social media."

Frances Bean Cobain says she feared she would die as she revealed she was a passenger on board the Air France jet which blew an engine in a terrifying mid-air ordeal .
The daughter of Nirvana rocker Kurt Cobain said she believed she would never see her mum, singer Courtney Love, or family and friends again as plane's engine disintegrated in the sky.
Horrifying video footage shows part of the plane's engine flapping in the air as it flew over the Atlantic Ocean with 520 passengers on board on Saturday, September 30.
The Airbus A380 aircraft, which was travelling from Paris to Los Angeles, was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada after the pilot declared a mayday.

Frances, 25, broke her silence six days after the horror, posting a picture of the jet's badly damaged engine on the tarmac.
In a lengthy caption, she explained how the near-miss was "the moment that would alter everything I thought I knew" and had made her reevaluate her life.
She revealed she wasn't actually meant to be on the flight but had changed her booking to get home to LA earlier.
(Image: Instagram/space_witch666)
She wrote: "I've avoided talking about this because telling strangers struck me as a fruitless endeavor.
"But enough time has gone by to where I've sat with what this experience should mean on the grand scale of living my day-to-day life.
"I have woken up everyday for the past week just grateful to wake up.
"When I felt the plane tilt, saw the wing directly in front of me catch fire, and basically came to grips with my own mortality I made a deal with myself.

"I promised myself that if I made it through, that I would no longer try to escape the moments of my life. I would no longer indulge in societal cliches & I would let the people I love know how much I love them everyday.
"Thinking I would never see my mom or my boyfriend or my grams or my pets or my friends again, sparked a renaissance of the soul / mind / body / spirit.
"So I've entered the phase of my life where every moment is truly precious. All the mundane "crippling" anxieties I once let dictate how I functioned have dissipated.
"I was jolted awake and awake is where I need to stay in order to live authentically. As cheeseball as that sounds. It resonates at true. To me. As you were - FBC."

Fellow passengers described how everything seemed normal until they heard a "loud thud and a lot of vibration" before the pilot declared an emergency.
Ground crews were left to "pick up pieces of the plane from the runway", one traveller added.
Flight records show the Airbus A380 aircraft, travelling under flight number AF66, was diverted to Canada's Goose Bay airport on its journey from Paris to LA.

Earlier this week, audio of the mayday call was released , in which one point a pilot is heard telling controllers on the ground: "Fuel remaining is 70 tonnes, Air France 066 super mayday."
The conversation between the crew and staff on the ground reveal how the A380 plane was guided in to land as a result of the emergency.
A voice on the ground is heard stating as the plane touched down: "I'm not able to tell what engine had trouble."

Air France confirmed there was "serious damage" to one of the plane's four engines before before it landed safely.
One traveller said on Twitter the engine had "blown over the Atlantic Ocean", leading to the emergency landing in Canada.
Another, named Daniel McNeely, said: "I'm on board. One of our engines is slightly blown apart. Just glad to be on the ground."

He later added, alongside a photo of the engine: "I think the engine has seen better days."
Peter Cowan also shared an image of the engine and wrote: "This is the reason ground crews had to pick up pieces of the plane off the runway after landing."
Goose Bay airport is a small site not normally equipped to handle such large aircraft, according to passengers.

Air France said in a statement: "Air France confirms that the crew of flight AF66 decided to divert to Goose Bay airport following serious damage on one of its four engines.
"The plane landed safely at 3.42pm and the regularly trained pilots and cabin crew handled this serious incident perfectly.
"The passengers are currently being assisted by teams dispatched to the location.
"Air France is currently working to re-route the passengers to Los Angeles via one of its connecting platforms in North America."
When it comes to shopping abroad, China's Millennials favor Dior, Prada and Gucci, according to a new survey on WeChat by the China i2i Group in Shanghai.
Aside from their buying power and influential style, these single shoppers between the ages of 18 and 39 are also the fastest-growing segment of outbound Chinese travelers. Combined they make up as much as 50 percent of total Chinese international shoppers.
Their top three favorite brands bought overseas were followed by Coach, Hermès, Chanel, Burberry, Boss and Tiffany. Interestingly, Louis Vuitton, which had in past years been ranked number one, is now 10th. That is an indication of how many Chinese Millennials “crave different brands compared to what their parents preferred,” according to Alexander Glos, China i2i chief executive officer.
Referring to two major trends in global Chinese travel shopping, he said, “The rise of the Millennial, or as I call them in China — ‘Singletons,' because they are choosing to enjoy life and are delaying marriage. Second, the willingness to explore with new brands, be unique and not be a follower.”
The bottom half of the list was comprised of Saint Laurent, Cartier, Omega, Leica, Rimowa and WMF, respectively, with the survey base of 11,500 Chinese travel shoppers.
The China i2i WeChat system uses traditional print publications distributed to Chinese travelers at the point of their travel visa application as the source to find what the company describes as “real” travelers. More than 99 percent of these readers will travel and each magazine has its own WeChat platform that readers are invited to join. This creates a 1.2 million travel shopper ecosystem that brands and retailers can tap to connect with customers on a daily basis, like a CRM system, the company said.
Based on the survey, these travelers accounted for more than $3.4 billion in annual shopping while traveling around the world, with 690,000 guests staying in four- or five-star hotels and 875,000 using rental cars. Ninety percent of the respondents said they shop when traveling abroad. Twenty-nine percent of respondents said they spend $1,469 a trip and 23 percent said they spend $2,939.
Ninety-four percent said they use their WeChat internationally while shopping and traveling. WeChat, China's largest social media platform with more than 900 million daily users, is routinely used between 45 and 65 times each day.
Looking ahead to where they hope to travel in the next year, Chinese Millennials put France, Italy, Germany and the U.K. at the top of the list. Switzerland as their fifth most-popular country to travel to. As for which U.S. cities, the Singletons plan to get to in the next 12 months, they listed New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.

GARY Corcoran and his entourage arrived at the Fortitude Gym in Newstead for their final workout before Wednesday night's world title fight only to be beaten to the punch.
Jeff Horn's conqueror was already having his photo taken.
While Corcoran's lifelong dream will come true if he manages to beat the world welterweight champ at the Convention Centre, Brisbane boxer Todd Kidd beat Horn not once, but twice, and has a unique place in world boxing history.
EXCLUSIVE: WHY CORCORAN CAN BY HORN'S WORST NIGHTMARE
In fact, Horn credits the 2008 Olympian with teaching him much about what it means to be a fighter.
While Kidd was not giving Corcoran any tips on how to beat Horn, the slick welterweight scored back-to-back wins over Horn in 2009, using sizzling speed and deft movement.
“I had competed at the Olympics in Beijing the year before I fought Jeff and at the time he was still rising through the ranks,'' said Kidd, 32, who now works as a personal trainer at the Fortitude Gym.
“At the time Jeff was a really good young amateur prospect eager to learn and he has certainly learnt a lot in the years since. What he's done in boxing is incredible.''
Camera Icon Former Olympic boxer Todd Kidd boasts a rare winning record against world champion Jeff Horn. Picture: Darren England Picture: News Limited
Horn describes Kidd as “one of the most brilliant Australian amateur fighters of recent times.''
His 158 amateur bouts included wins over an Olympic gold medallist and world amateur champion as well as Commonwealth Games and Olympic appearances.
When he was just 15, Kidd competed in Russia with Kostya Tszyu as his mentor.
“As I prepared to face him in our first fight in 2009, I was wary,'' Horn recalled.
“My girlfriend Jo (now wife) and I watched a video of Todd and I thought his jab and speed were sensational.
“Jo was nervous for me and asked, ‘Are you really sure you want to do this? He looks so fast. He's really, really good'.
“He was too. As the bout started and Todd's left hand came at me like a bullet, all I could think was, ‘Holy moly, how fast is this guy?'. Fighting him was a whole new experience.
“I made the fight competitive, but Todd's quickness and ring-smarts were too much and he outpointed me. He repeated the victory at the Golden Gloves tournament at Caboolture the following month.
“Todd was a great fighter and he is a terrific bloke, too, one of the nicest guys you could meet. In the years since I have done a lot of sparring with him. He turned professional but unfortunately his skin cuts like tissue paper and he could not scale the same heights that he had in the amateurs.''

Jeremy McConnell is so desperate to retain his fame that he's stooped to paying a Page 3 model to pretend to be his girlfriend, Mirror Online can exclusively reveal.
A source close to the shamed Irish model explains how Charlotte Huntley, 20 - pictured with Jez this week on a supposedly loved-up date to an ice-cream parlour - was PAID by Jez to act like his new love.
"He knows his name is slowly erasing from people's minds so a friend of a friend asked Charlotte if she wanted some publicity and she jumped at the chance," said the insider. "They both believe any publicity is good publicity."

"His friends are concerned at the lengths he's going to get attention - the first dates, dog walks in the park, rolling sushi... who knows what's next?
"It was only last week he set up pictures of him out walking with a different girl as his screensaver.
"He is desperate to get his name back out there, even dropping his pants in public.
"He's done the deal now with Charlotte, got them both publicity and now he's back in Dublin where he plans to spend his time working out how to make money moving forward as his debts are mounting since coming out of prison," the pal added.
Jeremy's rep denied the claims and insisted Jeremy had not paid Charlotte to hang out with him.
The 27-year-old criminal, who first came to public attention on 2016's Celebrity Big Brother , has certainly been splashing the cash in the six months since he was convicted of violently assaulting Stephanie while she was cradling their then eight-week-old son Caben.

He flew to Turkey for a beard and hair transplant, and in doing so managed to violate the terms of his community service, which got him hauled back to court and jailed.
Jeremy was then released just before New Year's Eve and celebrated the start of 2018 as a free man.
He then treated himself to a string of fresh tattoos, including his prison number that was in use for just 34 days to 'remind himself' of what he'd been through.
Since then he's splashed out on new teeth, a fake lordship and a full head tattoo of a skull and a heart-shaped lock that meant his brand-new hair had to be shaved off.
The inking cost him thousands of pounds - while Stephanie has claimed Jez hasn't spent a single penny on son Caben since his birth last January.
Students mobilize in light of offensive flyers; admin sends campus-wide email
Perla Luna
Managing Editor
February 1, 2018
Bubbling frustration over anti-immigration posters found on Jan. 21 has spurred campus groups into action.
The Undocumented Students and Allies Association (USAA) is at the forefront of the mobilization, hoping to use this an opportunity to show the administration why the goals they've been working toward since their inception in 2016 are necessary.
“Our goal has always been to get a resource center where undocumented and mixed status students can feel safe and get the resources they need to be successful,” said senior Marlene Cerritos, co-chair of USAA. “Whether that is obtaining resources for healing or legal help, or coping mechanisms for when something like this happens.”
USAA also advocates hiring a paid staff member to address immigration issues and educate the larger Santa Clara community so that the responsibility doesn't fall on students.
This is a tendency the Blue Ribbon Commission for Diversity and Inclusion found, noting that “SCU community members also acknowledge that a disproportionate burden is placed on students of color to foster more inclusive environments.” The report cites the Rainbow Resource Center as an example of students running operations in roles typically staffed by full-time professionals at comparable universities.
Initially, students were frustrated with the lack of administrative response on the matter. Then Vice Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Dennis Jacobs released a statement to the campus on Jan. 25, also released to outside media, calling for civic discourse.
According to Jacobs, he learned about the incident on Monday and was later “dismayed” when he saw a copy of the poster because it “co-opted a phrase (“#NoMeansNo”) commonly associated with the critical fight to end sexual assault, and used it to provoke a visceral anti-immigrant sentiment.”
“I chose to write to the campus community, because I saw how discourse across the political divide at SCU was quickly degrading into accusations and attacks that resembled the lobbing of hand grenades,” Jacobs said. “As we see in national politics, the all-too-common impulse has been to demonize or tune out those who do not subscribe to one's own point of view, rather than to listen with respect to the opinions and concerns of the ‘other.' As tense as the current political climate is, Santa Clara University has a responsibility, now more than ever, to model civil discourse and equip our students with the ability to navigate diversity of thought.”
On Jan. 30, nine days after the posters were found, university President Michael Engh, S.J. also released a statement. He too emphasized the importance of civil discourse and condemned the posters for not providing “a means for dialogue among those with different opinions.”
“It makes a statement, but does not promote discourse or allow for the expression of differences of viewpoints and beliefs,” Engh said. “It does not encourage constructive dialogue, but hides in the shadows and it insults by demeaning those whom it rejects. Such a poster is unworthy of this campus where we seek to bring students together.”
The email seemed to send mixed messages to some students.
“The university will always encourage civil discourse because it benefits their image,” Cerritos said. “But they are always leaving it up to the students to address these issues and always encourage students to reach to the other side when we are the ones who are constantly being attacked by posters, signs or comments.”
In the email, Engh also revealed he will meet or has met with leaders from the Multicultural Center (MCC), USAA and College Republicans to better understand their concerns and experiences at Santa Clara.
“A place for civil discourse and the free exchange of ideas is necessary here at Santa Clara, especially because this is a place of learning,” sophomore Sydney Altobell said, president of SCU College Republicans. “Fr. Engh is wrong when he says the posters do not encourage constructive dialogue because, ironically, they have sparked the start of a constructive conversation about our campus climate.”
Some feel the administrative response has come too late and without tangible action.
“I just believe this cycle is exhausting for marginalized students—and it's not our job to defend ourselves and educate the rest of the Santa Clara community,” Cerritos said. “I'm glad Fr. Engh is going to listen to students but it makes me wonder if he has been listening to us all along. This isn't the first time this has happened and it won't be the last.”
The Office of Student Life is currently undergoing an investigation of the incident since the flyers were in violation of the university's postings policy.
The policy states that all posted materials must be approved first and must not be in violation of sections five or 10 of the Student Conduct Code. Section five prohibits “disorderly, lewd, indecent, or obscene conduct” and section 10 prohibits “hazing, harassing, threatening, bullying, degrading language or actions.”
It is unclear whether the posters fall into the category of a bias incident, an ambiguity in the written rules ASG is actively working to clarify. Since it is a student conduct issue, both the identity of anyone involved and the consequences are confidential.
But, for many, finding out who originally posted the flyers has never been the point.
“We as students understand we're not going to be able to get those specific details and I don't think folks are really concerned with that,” said MCC Director Zerreen Kazi. “It's more like how can we support the students that are affected, regardless of who specifically did it because it is part of a larger system. It's not just this one incident that has caused damage.”

Sexual Harassment Allegations Against Harvey Weinstein Go Back 3 Decades NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Kim Masters, host at KCRW and editor at large at The Hollywood Reporter, about the allegations against Weinstein that The New York Times reported.
It's a lofty promise: free, universal, all-day pre-K for every 4-year-old child in Chicago.Mayor Rahm Emanuel made that commitment Wednesday as he unveiled his plan at Truman College, one of five City Colleges that offer full-day pre-school programs for young children."It's like three years, they're in school already. They already know their routines, they know how to be independent, go to the bathroom on their own, wash their hands. They know how to clean up after themselves, they're all ready for kindergarten," said Cristine Martinez, a pre-K teacher at Truman College.The new entitlement is expected to cost $175 million. Emanuel said a change in the school funding formula approved by the General Assembly last year will cover most of the costs, as long as those monies continue to be approved. At present, preschool in Chicago is free for the poorest families, while others pay on a sliding scale, up to $14,000 dollars a year. But because space is limited and admission is mostly based on need, many middle-income parents are shut out entirely."The first group of kids that will get all-day, full-day pre-K, 4-years-old, are children of parents who work, make $45,000 or less, and that will be the first installment," Emanuel said.A student at Truman College, Isabel Lopez is able to enroll her 3-year-old son Vincent in the full-day program. It's meant he's learning important skills, while she's able to finish her degree."It's meant the world to me right now. I'm finishing my internship and my bachelor's and I'm going into nursing school. If I didn't have this program here, there is no way I would be able to pursue my career," Lopez said.CPS will use existing funds to cover the initial rollout this fall. After that if the district gets the extra money it wants to from the state, then the plan is for every 4-year-old in Chicago to have access to full time pre-K by 2021.

Martinez has reportedly hailed his survival as a miracle.
It was, he said, a second chance at life.

"It felt like a sledgehammer hit me over the head," he said.
He was transferred to Valley Baptist Medical Center, Harlingen, where doctors removed the bullet fragment which had penetrated his skull and lodged itself into the top layer of his brain, CNN reports .
Martinez told the broadcaster the bullet was from a .223 caliber round.

"Had it gone any further, I don't think we would be having this conversation," he told CNN.
Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra told the broadcaster it appeared it was a "stray bullet".
There was no evidence to suggest the lawmaker was targeted.

Meghan Markle has reportedly ordered her sick father not to get behind the wheel of a car as he recovers from heart surgery.
Thomas Markle was forced to miss the royal wedding in London after having an operation, and instead watched the ceremony on TV in a £23-a-night Airbnb.
And his daughter and her new husband Prince Harry have apparently laid the law down with the retired Hollywood lighting director, ordering him to take it easy.
"He's spoken to Prince Harry on many occasions and he has spoken to Harry and Meghan since the wedding. They're worried about him and have told him not to drive as he recovers from his heart operation," Lori Davis, 38 - who lives in the same gated community as Thomas - told The Sun .

Speaking with Thomas' permission, the mother-of-one revealed that Harry did call to ask his permission to marry Meghan before popping the question last November.
And she insists that despite being 'shy', Thomas had always planned to walk his youngest daughter down the aisle just like Princess Diana's father did for her.
However, his heart issues coupled with the paparazzi pictures he was caught staging 'put paid to any hope he had of going," claims Lori, who took him fruit and jelly to eat before the televised service.

"Tom watched the ceremony by himself. He thought the wedding was beautiful but I am sure forever he will regret not being there... he thought she looked amazing... he'll always be disappointed he couldn't be there," she added.
Interestingly, Lori also claimed it was Meghan's idea to have Prince Charles walk her down the aisle after her dad pulled out at the final hour.
At the time, Meghan and Harry took the unusual step of making a public plea for Thomas to be left alone as they tried to come up with a plan B.
"This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding," a statement from Kensington Palace read.
"She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation."
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether federal immigration law gives the government the power to indefinitely detain any noncitizen it is considering deporting if the person previously committed certain crimes.
The Supreme Court agreed Monday to consider the issue. Immigration law says that if noncitizens commit a crime for which they can be deported, the government should take them into custody for potential removal when they're released from prison or jail. A person detained immediately can be held indefinitely. The government argues the same is true if the person is released and then later detained for possible removal.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that noncitizens not promptly detained must be given the opportunity to be released on bond.

Romelu Lukaku isn't having the best time of things right now.
The Belgian forward has scored just two times in his last 14 appearances for Manchester United, and he drew a blank again against Manchester City at the weekend as Jose Mourinho's men slipped to a damaging 2-1 defeat to the champions-elect in a bad-tempered match, after which he's been accused of throwing a bottle at City coach Mikel Arteta .
The £75m summer addition from Everton started his United career like a house on fire, but now 16 Premier Leagues matches into the campaign he's sitting on eight league goals for his new club.
Which, this season at least, is the same amount as... Wayne Rooney.

Premier League goals this season Romelu Lukaku 8 Wayne Rooney 8
Yep, the former United forward's penalty for Everton in the 1-1 Merseyside derby draw on Sunday was his sixth goal in his last seven Premier League games, drawing him level with the former Blues forward in the top scorers' list - along with Alexandre Lacazette and Gabriel Jesus.
Needless to say, there has been plenty of reaction to this on Twitter:
What's more, Rooney's eight strikes have come at a rate of 134 minutes per goal, and in a team that were struggling this season, while Lukaku's have come at 180 minutes per goal in a side near the top.
Will they still be neck-and-neck come the end of the season?

College students favor free expression and First Amendment rights on campus, but with certain limitations, according to a study conducted in 2017.
In this study released on March 11 by the Knight Foundation and its partners, thousands of four-year university students from 240 campuses were asked their feelings regarding free speech and protecting the First Amendment.
According to the Knight Foundation, students generally prefer a campus where a wide range of views are expressed. Seventy percent prefer an open learning environment, allowing speech offensive toward certain groups of individuals. However, two-thirds of students said hate speech should not be protected by the First Amendment.
“But there is a big difference between offensive language and insulting, crude, crass language,” said Hyrum Lewis, a History, Geography and Political Science instructor on campus. “So, while we may want to uphold classroom rules to keep speech civil (avoiding curse words and ad hominem attacks, for instance), we would never want to prevent certain arguments from being made (in civil terms) no matter how ‘offensive' they might be to someone somewhere.”
Lewis said there is a difference between making an argument for or against an affirmative action and calling someone derogatory terms.
An overwhelming majority of 87 percent felt providing safe spaces for students who feel threatened by speech would be a good solution. In addition, 83 percent felt establishing free speech zones on a campus where students can openly discuss and debate would prevent others from being hurt by the words of others.
“You can't go through life being afraid of being offended,” said Hunter Thompson, a freshman studying construction management. “These free speech zones aren't really free speech zones at all. It is a liberal gathering point in which they can gather in large and beat down the one that goes against their beliefs.”
Thompson said it is not free speech when individuals shut down the ideas of others. He felt individuals should be able to express themselves and share their ideas without a fear of being stopped by the opposing side, no matter what their political beliefs are.
Results from the study also show 64 percent of students feel their freedom of speech is secure in the United States, a nine percent decrease from 2016.
Samantha Frost, a junior at Western Washington University, said, “I feel that not only am I able to, but I'm encouraged to by the University to use my first amendment right to share my political beliefs,”
Frost is a part of Young Democrats of WWU, which regularly holds events on campus to protest and debate controversial political views.
“For a democracy to thrive, citizens must be able to express their views on important issues to inform their elected leaders about what they want them to do,” according to the study. “But all citizens regardless of their background should have the same opportunity to express their views.”
This is where students place a high value on protecting free speech rights, with 56 percent saying it is “extremely important to do so” and another 33 percent say it is “very important.”
“It is useful for society to have free speech because it is how we gain greater knowledge,” Lewis said. “None of us is infallible; we all have deficiencies of understanding and knowledge that can be corrected. It's through the airing of different ideas and the clash of perspectives that we get closer to the truth.”
He said he is a strong believer in the First Amendment and he considers freedom of speech a cornerstone of American freedom. He said it is important to engage in alternative views honestly and respectfully to strengthen our own beliefs. He describes the classroom as a place dedicated to gaining truth and knowledge, and without freedom of speech, individuals are unable to gain knowledge for themselves.
The Knight Foundation was founded in 1950 to facilitate “informed and engaged communities” allowing democracy to be well-functioning and representative government.
A 92-year-old World War II veteran who has terminal cancer got to celebrate his life with loved ones at his own wake in Michigan.
The Detroit Free Press reports that a living wake was held Sunday at the Walter F. Bruce VFW Post for Johnny Wearing, who was able to say thanks and goodbye to his loved ones.
The Detroit native learned about three weeks ago that he has very little time to live because of the liver cancer he's been fighting for years. His friend Matthew Seely decided to set aside funds that would've typically been earmarked for a memorial luncheon and organize the celebration instead.
Along with family, attendees included Wearing's friends from the Barbershop Quartet Society and children of his fellow WWII bomber crew members.

FRESH: Chef Tony Crossin has cooked for Australia's top athletes and is now living in Noosa.
WHEN Tony Crossin puts on his "suit of armour”, he can do anything.
While it's not a bullet-proof vest, it is something that helps him ensure the health and well-being of everyday people.
"I can go and talk to 1000 people in a room, as long as I've got my chef's jacket on, I'm fine. I can do whatever,” Tony said.
"You see these superheroes, I say, 'that's what my superhero outfit is'.”
The Sydney chef has had a rewarding career cooking for some of Australia's most elite athletes, but recently decided to make a sea change to Noosa with his wife.
His speciality is nutrition and healthy eating, creating delicious meals full of vitamins, minerals and all things nourishing.
Recently, his confidence- boosting suit of armour was put to the test during filming of an episode of the Biggest Loser Transformed.
10 contestants were given one hour to cook for 45 burly AFL players, the GWS Giants, a situation Tony describes as "complete pandemonium”.
"It was frantic,” Tony said.
"I'd say there were 30 people in the room, in a small kitchen. We had 10 contestants, five cameramen, five sound guys, two producers, two assistants.
"I was being pulled from place to place. It was crazy.
"But it was really good. They (contestants) all worked really well together, they had a lot of fun. I was very proud of them.”
Before his move to Noosa, Tony was a full-time cook for the GWS Giants, the Bulldogs and the St Illawarra Dragons in Sydney.
His career began in the UK, cooking and designing meals for British Airways.
"I ran the biggest flight kitchen in Europe. It was a massive operation - we used to make 300,000 meals a day,” Tony said.
"Then I took up a job flying around the world designing airline menus, which is when I discovered Australia.”
After eight years working for Qantas, Tony decided he wanted to start a business combining his two loves - food and sport.
"I wanted to get back into cooking,” he said.
"I had a passion for sport, I had a passion for food, so I wanted to start something where I could bring them together.”
He set up a business cooking and delivering nutritious ready-made meals, and that was when sporting teams started contacting him for catering assistance.
Chef Tony moved up to Noosa from Sydney. Amber Macpherson
Tony said a big part of his career has been educating not only everyday people, but athletes as well, about the importance of eating correctly.
"I've spent the last 10 years trying to help people understand how important your diet is in the whole nutrition part of it,” Tony said.
"It's more important than the actual physical elements. It's a case of getting both of those things right.
"If people eat well, they feel better, they're able to eat more, their whole body changes.”
Tony also ran a cooking school in Sydney teaching people the tricks of the trade to boost their confidence in their home kitchens.
"The idea of our cooking school was for people to come in and it felt like a home-style kitchen.
"We were more targeting mums and dads and kids to get them to come into a kitchen environment.
"It's more engaging with people, it's more about them asking questions and getting to understand how things work.
"People just don't know things like how to cut an onion up properly. That's the sort of thing. I can't tell you how many times I was asked that question.”
So what are some healthy eating tips, and of course, the onion secret?
"The basic things is to get the protein right, the carbohydrates right. Once you've got the ratio right for you, it works really well,” he said.
"Find some colour for your meals in your salad and vegetables. I try to incorporate texture into it as well; you need a bit of crunch.
"Think of things you can flavour it with - onions, shallots, herbs, flavour. Then all you've got to do is prepare your protein, put it together - done. You can make a really good dish that's really colourful.
"(When) cutting onions, have a little bowl of water on the corner of your chopping board. The moisture from the onion will look for moisture, and that's your eyes, mouth, nose. And using a really sharp knife helps.
"As a chef, we just know how to do things like that. Once you start imparting those onto people, they go, 'wow, it's that easy'. It's not complicated, it's actually really easy.”
Tony hopes to start offering his knowledge to local gyms, healthcare facilities and set up a cooking school in Noosa.
If you'd like to get in contact with Tony, email him on tonyjcrossin@gmail.com.

ESSEN, Germany Thyssenkrupp's (TKAG.DE) works council chief said on Wednesday he would oppose any further restructuring of the German industrial group's European steel business until there was clarity over a possible merger with Tata Steel Europe (TISC.NS).
Thyssenkrupp's chief executive has signalled there would be more restructuring, with or without a merger. Labour representatives expect to be informed about the latest plans at a meeting on Friday.

by Richard Gladwell, Sail-World.com today at 6:58 amWith brighter skies, the cycling team took their places on the pedalstals and used leg power to provide the hydraulic pressure necessary to run the AC50's control systems for the foils and wingsail.The story broke this afternoon that top New Zealand cyclist Simon van Velthooven (28), a 2012 Olympic Bronze cycling medallist had been signed by the New Zealand America's Cup team.Yesterday's impromptu unveiling of the row of four bike seats instead of where the other teams have standard grinding pedestals triggered questions as to where the advantage really lay.In US Sailing media Oracle Team USA quoted one of their grinders as being able to produce 300watts continually over a 25-minute race (496 watts equals 1hp). In the 2010 America's Cup where a small engine was used to replace a grinding team on Oracle's 120ft trimaran. The change was rationalised on the basis of quoted output of 250watts per grinder - with the eight grinders aboard being capable of producing a combined total 2hp or the power of a small sewing machine for a period of 40 seconds until lactic acid cut in.
A 2003 study of Emirates Team NZ grinders concluded that the grinding technique and correct body position was vital to achieve maximum effective output. The best effort produced around 550watts for 5 seconds.
Top cyclist Fabian Cancellara (SUI) is reported to have produced over 435watts over a 15 minute period having spent 55 minutes riding at Olympic Gold medal pace. He amped his output to 540 watts for two laps of the 70-minute race.
Double Gold medal winning rower Eric Murray set the world record 5km ergo (rowing machine) time taking 14 min 56sec with an average output of 480 watts.
The statistics would tend to indicate that conventional grinding platforms are the least efficient in producing power over a sustained period. The ultimate test being whether there is a drop in output from the cyclists in an AC50 multihull below that achieved by conventional grinders on the water.

New Delhi: If you have long been planning to buy your dream home, Navratri is perhaps a good time to do so. As per property consultant JLL India report, as many as 4.4 lakh housing units were unsold in seven major cities at the end of 2017 with Delhi-NCR contributing maximum at over 1.5 lakh flats.

Rescue operations are part of a confirmatory search since more people were suspected trapped under the debris, as the buses were carrying more than 60 passengers. Photo: Reuters
New Delhi: The death toll in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi region, where two passenger buses were hit by landslides on Sunday morning, has now reached 48.
Rescue operations were temporarily stalled on Sunday night, but resumed early Monday morning, a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) official said.
Monday's rescue operations are part of a confirmatory search since more people were suspected trapped under the debris, as the buses were carrying more than 60 passengers, said NDRF.
“Search and rescue operations have resumed because we are trying to keep a count of the total number of people who had been travelling and the number of people who could be trapped. As of Sunday night, 47 bodies had been recovered,” the NDRF official stated.
The two buses were hit by a landslide, which had been triggered by a sudden cloudburst, in Mandi's Kotpuri area on Sunday morning.
While other parts of the country—Assam, Manipur, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan—have also been grappling with floods caused by heavy rainfall this year, officials stated that this incident was the biggest calamity to have struck the Himalayan town this year.
“Small episodes of cloudbursts and landslides have been reported earlier from the Himalayan regions in past years as well, following the 2013 Uttarakhand floods. But this landslide which has killed close to 50 people is the biggest tragedy from the region this year,” said a senior home ministry official.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also tweeted his condolences to the families of those affected by the landslides.
Last year, more than 30 people were killed after heavy rain and landslides hit Uttarakhand's Pithoragrah district.
The home ministry, however, continued to sound alarm bells in other parts of the country as well. On Sunday, it sounded a warning for West Bengal's Cooch Behar district where the Raidak river was flowing at 1.20 metres above its danger mark of 35.3 metres in the district's Tufaganj area.
Likewise, it also added that the Mahananda river in Bihar's Purnia district was flowing at 37.6 metres, 1.95 metres above the usual danger mark.
The NDRF added that in addition to 10 of its rescue teams, which had already been deployed in Bihar, four more teams had been moved from Odisha's Bhubaneshwar to Purnia for flood rescue operations.

A man's arm was ripped off after 'getting it caught on a conveyor belt' at a recycling tip.
The 29-year-old man was rushed to hospital after it's understood he got his arm caught in the machinery while working at the Sharston Tip in south Manchester.
The young man remains in a serious but stable condition and his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, a police spokesman confirmed.
Residents living nearby reported seeing a heavy police presence around the area after officers and ambulance services were called at about 11pm on Sunday evening.
A joint investigation has been launched by police and the Health and Safety Executive into how the accident occurred.

The tip in Wythenshaw is owned by waste management company Viridor and the materials recycling facility at the tip, where the accident occurred, has been closed off while an investigation takes place.
Members of the public are still able to dump their waste at the household waste recycling centre next door, which remains open.
A spokeswoman for the waste and recycling company said: “Viridor can confirm an incident took place at 11pm on Sunday, August 13, involving a 29-year-old employee at the Longley Lane Materials Recycling Facility.
“The employee was taken straight to hospital following the incident.

“Viridor takes the safety and wellbeing of its employees very seriously and is co-operating fully with Greater Manchester Police and the Health and Safety Executive.”
A GMP spokesman said: “We were called at 11.15pm to reports of a work-based accident involving a conveyor belt.
“Emergency services were called and the man was taken to hospital with serious injuries to his arm.
“A joint police and HSE investigation has been launched and remains ongoing.”
A Health and Safety Executive spokeswoman said: “HSE is aware of an incident and is investigating.”

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Villanova coach Jay Wright has seen his team deal with all the things that go along with being the nation's top-ranked school, from the extra attention to handling an upset loss.
It's why Wright figures his Wildcats — who are sitting atop the AP Top 25 for the third straight season — are prepared for what awaits.
“I think we've got the experience now to understand it's a great honor,” Wright told The Associated Press, “but a lot of responsibility comes with it.”
After a tumultuous week in which unanimous No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kansas lost, the Wildcats (10-0) earned 41 of 65 first-place votes to hop over Michigan State and reach the top. Next up is Philadelphia neighbor Temple on Wednesday.

Villanova reached No. 1 for the first time in February 2016 and stayed there for three polls before going on to win the national championship. The Wildcats held the No. 1 spot three different times last season, including in the final poll entering the NCAA Tournament.
This year's team started the year at No. 6 with preseason AP All-American Jalen Brunson. The Wildcats won the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas last month and beat No. 12 Gonzaga in New York last week, with Mikal Bridges (18.1 points) making a big leap to give Villanova a strong 1-2 punch.
This year's Wildcats rank third nationally in KenPom's adjusted offensive efficiency (119.9 points per 100 possessions) and seventh in adjusted defensive efficiency (90.6). They are the only team in the top 10 of both categories.
“We've handled all those challenges so far,” Wright said. “Now this is a new challenge. How do you handle this? How do you handle that teams come at you at a completely different level. Fans come at you at a completely different level. We've done that a couple of times. And now we've got to do it with this group.”
SPARTANS NEXT
Villanova and Michigan State were the favorites to take over at the top after the Blue Devils' weekend loss at Boston College.
The Spartans (9-1) earned 19 first-place votes to climb from third to second, while the other five first-place votes went to Arizona State — which leapt 11 spots to No. 5 after Sunday's win at Kansas .
Tom Izzo's club returns to action Saturday against Oakland in Detroit.
SUN DEVILS RISING
Arizona State will carry its highest ranking since reaching third during the 1980-81 season when it hosts Vanderbilt on Sunday.
TOP MATCHUP
With many teams in exam breaks, the AP Top 25 schedule is fairly light for the week ahead. The top game comes Sunday, when No. 7 North Carolina visits No. 20 Tennessee.
Both teams climbed four spots in this week's poll. The Volunteers played the Tar Heels tough last year in Chapel Hill, with UNC having to rally from 15 down and block a late shot to secure a 73-71 win .
HOOSIER STATE FIGHTS
The Crossroads Classic is set for Saturday. The Indianapolis doubleheader includes No. 17 Purdue meeting Butler and No. 18 Notre Dame facing Indiana.
CLIMBING BACK
Arizona has gone from No. 2 in the country to unranked and now back in the poll again. All in a month.
The Wildcats fell out after a lackluster performance in the Bahamas, but four straight wins brought them back into this week's poll at No. 23. Arizona plays at New Mexico on Saturday.
WATCH LIST
Creighton is the top team among the “Others Receiving Votes” and hosts Maryland-Eastern Shore in its only game this week. But the next team in the list — Oklahoma — has the best chance to help its case of getting into next week's poll. The Sooners visit No. 3 Wichita State on Saturday.

More than 40 trainee engineers will be hired across Lancashire as part of the largest recruitment drive ever undertaken by Openreach.
The announcement follows news that Openreach, will accelerate plans to build more ultrafast Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) broadband across the country.
The 42 Lancashire roles, part of more than 3,500 being recruited across the UK during the next 12 months, including 283 in the North West, will be located in Blackburn, Burnley, Fleetwood, Fylde, Lancaster, Lunesdale, Morecambe and Ribble Valley.
Trainees will join the UK's largest team of telecoms engineers working to expand, upgrade, maintain and install new services over Openreach's national broadband network.
Openreach's ‘Fibre First' programme will deliver expanded ‘full fibre' FTTP networks in up to 40 towns, cities and boroughs, setting it on a trajectory to reach ten million British premises by the mid-2020s.
It has committed to making FTTP available in three million British homes and business by the end of 2020 and, if the conditions are right, intends to go significantly further, bringing the benefits of FTTP technology to the majority of homes and businesses in the UK.
Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach, said: “These trainee engineers will be playing a vital role in the future success and prosperity of the UK. Over the last year our 22,200 engineers have been the driving force behind Government reaching its target of making ‘superfast' broadband available to more than 95 per cent of the country, whilst also improving our customer service performance – but we want to do more.
“Every day, Openreach engineers are working in all weathers across the length and breadth of Britain, connecting homes and businesses and making sure people can access the high quality broadband services they need.”
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KWQC) — More than a week after a terrifying Iowa road rage incident, many are asking why authorities aren't doing anything about it.
A semi driver was heading west on Highway 30 near Cedar Rapids when video shows a white car swerving in front of it and slamming on its brakes. The truck was just inches away from smashing into the back of the car on several occasions.
The driver of the truck says she contacted police, but was told there was nothing that could be done.
Mark Lowe with the Iowa Deptment of Transportation explained.
“I would be careful not to second guess the state patrol because part of what they're evaluating is not only is there a violation there that I can identify but is there enough information to connect that violation to a specific driver so that I can make a citation stick.”
The truck driver says she likely made the driver in the white car angry when he had to wait for her to pass another truck.

ST. LOUIS – Dark green needles and that familiar fragrant Christmas tree smell filled a warehouse off Pennsylvania Street. They're made of wire and clippings from balsam fir trees, but the wreaths inside these boxes are precious cargo for one South St. Louis moving company.
“Yeah there's a lot going on,” says Josh McGuire, McGuire Moving & Storage. “It's a busy place.”
On Monday morning, McGuire Moving and Storage made it their mission to receive, store, and help deliver thousands of wreaths by Wednesday, so that they can be placed on veteran graves across America on Saturday, December 16.
“Our truck drivers will bring them from Maine to here and then anybody goes from here to the West Coast that can't directly from here will come here and pick up their loads and take them to the West Coast,” says Jeremy Wentzell, Wreaths Across America.
The non-profit organization Wreaths Across America works to remember fallen United States veterans, honor those who serve, and teach children the value of freedom by placing ceremonial wreaths on veterans' graves from Arlington National Cemetery to Jefferson Barracks.
“This is our first time hosting the cross doc facility for the Midwest. It's a lot of work sometimes and then standing around and waiting for the next truck to come in,” Wentzell says. “But overall, it's hard not to enjoy it because everybody that walks in seems to enjoy doing something charitable. So they tend to be in a good mood.”
Whether it's the season or their civic duty, the crews at McGuire will be working nonstop until Wednesday to make sure the wreaths get out the doors, on the trucks and delivered in time for Saturday morning.
A JILTED lover has been convicted of severely injuring a chihuahua after he threw the dog to the ground in a fit of rage when his ex-partner rejected him.
Raymond Lyle Roberts, 49, faced Lismore Local Court this week for a hearing into the January 13 incident.
The court heard from two police witnesses who recalled attending the Nimbin property of the dog's owner, Linda Roberts.
Veterinarian John Campbell said the dog, named Lilly-Rose, had a "ruptured eardrum" and "damage to balance centre of the brain".
Mr Campbell said he began "conservative treatment" with medication in a bid to avoiding harming the dog further.
He said a "young girl" - believed to be the granddaughter of the accused and Ms Roberts - brought the dog to him and was "upfront" that she had no money to pay for treatment.
He said the chihuahua's injuries were "definitely consistent with something very traumatic".
Prosecutor Jodie Millar argued, through Ms Roberts' testimony, the accused threw the dog to the ground in a rage after being rejected by her.
The court heard the two had been in a relationship "as teens".
But defence solicitor Tom Saunders said this was at odds with her account to police, which was recorded on video, on the day of the incident.
In the video, which was played in court, Ms Roberts tells police the accused "dropped" the dog.
She said the defendant said: "you love this f***ing dog more than your grandchildren" before Lilly-Rose fell to the ground.
Roberts claimed he had become angry after asking to rekindle a long-defunct relationship - a proposal which she rejected.
She said Lilly-Rose had largely recovered from the injury but was "not the same" and was "slow" since the incident.
But when he took to the stand, Roberts said his ex-partner had been acting in an abusive manner toward their granddaughter before he grabbed the dog by the scruff of her neck.
"I love the dog," Roberts said.
"I was trying to make a point.
"When I was about to get up and leave she (knocked items off) the table and I lost my bananas".
Mr Saunders argued his client never meant to hurt the dog.
"There was no intention to hurt the animal," he said.
Magistrate Jeff Linden said he was "not satisfied" with a previous charge of aggravated animal cruelty, as the dog's condition had significantly improved when Mr Campbell saw her again on January 15.
But he convicted Roberts of the lesser charge of animal cruelty.
"The dog was in significant pain," Mr Linden said.
He noted Mr and Ms Roberts had both consumed a "substantial quantity of alcohol" before their altercation.
He said regardless of the specifics of the situation, there was "no other hypothesis" than that the dog was injured that night.
Roberts, who is on carer's benefits, was given a 12-month good behaviour bond.
Mr Linden also granted a two-year apprehended violence order against Roberts.
Black And Latino Children Are Often Overlooked When It Comes To Autism
Enlarge this image Shannon Wright for NPR Shannon Wright for NPR
Sherry Alvarez says she knew there was something different about her son since he was about 9 months old. Back then Sherry says his pediatrician told her there was nothing to worry about, " 'Boys are a little slower than girls, so let's just wait until his second birthday.' " We aren't using Sherry's son's name to protect his privacy.
By her son's second birthday, Sherry says she was getting desperate. She didn't know why he wasn't talking yet or showing affection like other kids. At 2 1/2, he was referred to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
There, after four hours of tests, Sherry says the doctor handed her a 20-page report explaining his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, among others. She says she was paralyzed by emotion.
ASD is a disease that affects people of all races and ethnicities, but research shows that African-American and Latino children with autism are diagnosed at older ages than white children, giving them less of an opportunity for proper intervention and treatment.
This is especially true of minimally verbal kids like Sherry's son and there are many possible reasons for a late diagnosis. Some families face healthcare access issues and prohibitive costs for treatment, and some families just don't know how important it is to get diagnosed to move on to the treatment phase. The dialog between doctors and minority families during the diagnosis process is critical.
A recent study from Georgia State University found that African-American parents reported fewer concerns about behaviors like delayed speech and repetitive behaviors, even though their children showed a greater severity with these symptoms, overall. But, of course, it isn't all up to parents.
"There are very likely parent aspects of this and very likely clinician aspects of this," says Meghan Rose Donohue, a lead researcher on the study. Perhaps families, like Sherry's, don't have the information necessary to really push physicians, but it is also possible that doctors don't take these cases seriously enough from the beginning.
Families and doctors, alike, can mistake ASD for simple bad behavior, especially in boys, as research has shown over the past couple of decades. A 2001 study at McGill University in Montreal found that doctors were more hesitant to diagnose ASD in minority families.
In 2007, a study by a team at the Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, found that African-American children were 5.1 times more likely to be misdiagnosed with conduct disorders before being diagnosed with ASD.
When Sherry was growing up, she had a cousin who the family thought of as "different," she says. "He was basically hidden. We didn't talk about it as a community." He had autism. "We have to retrain ourselves. It's not OK to hide our kids."
Regional Centers in Los Angeles, which offer services to the developmentally disabled, are now starting to look at the diagnosis disparity problem. Westside Regional Center in Culver City just received a grant from the state to look at how autism diagnosis disparities manifest within their intake and treatment programs.
"We've implemented a series of trainings with intake counselors on cultural awareness and sensitivity, and we're starting to have a lot of conversations about biases," says Tom Kelly, Westside's chief psychologist.
One of the apparent biases among intake counselors at the center stems from the difference in the documentation that arrives with each new child. African-American families tend to arrive at the center with lots of documentation detailing behavior issues from their child's school or social services. With all those official papers sitting in front of them, it's much easier for a counselor to think "behavior disease" rather than "autism," says Kelly.
And that disparity exists in dollars spent, as well. As reported in a 2017 survey, South Central Regional Center spends $8,000 less per client than the Westside location and the racial disparity persists statewide.
But there are more resources for minority families today than compared to when Sherry's son was young. The Autism Society of Los Angeles runs a hotline to help parents navigate the diagnosis and healthcare landscape and Children's Hospital Los Angeles now employs liaisons to help families connect with the right resources. But, the spending gap persists.
Today, Sherry says her now 15-year-old son is happy. He attends Hamilton High School and communicates almost solely through a typing device. "This is the time in his life where those early treatments could have made a difference," she laments.

This was the scene of devastation after a gas explosion that left three elderly residents badly injured.
The blast went off in a semi-detached house in Birstall, Leicestershire, at 7.30am.
The owner, who has not been named, was pulled alive from under the collapsed staircase .
Neighbour Janet Jasper, 79, was injured when the bedroom wall collapsed on her as she slept.
Her husband John, 80, who had been downstairs, is also in hospital.
Resident Tony Timson, 66, said: “The damage was catastrophic.”

The homeowner pulled from the staircase was found unconscious after the blast rocked the quiet, snowy village of Birstall, Leicestershire, this morning.
He was discovered with severe cuts to his head and a "flight of stairs on top of him" - but was still breathing, witness John Ketteringham claimed.
Next door's bedroom was also ripped apart in the explosion, while a woman living opposite saw her own bedroom windows "blow in".

Nearly 100 properties were left without electricity after engineers disconnected the mains for safety reasons.
Mr Ketteringham, 31, who lives nearby and was one of the first on the scene, described how the pensioner was discovered in the rubble.
He told the Leicester Mercury : “We found one old chap buried in the rubble. He had bad head lacerations, and was unconscious, with a flight of stairs on top of him, but he was still breathing.

"He had a flight of stairs on top of him, but was breathing"
“It looks like it was a gas explosion. I was woken up by the bang and pulled my clothes on and ran to do what I could to help."
He added: “There was a young boy who had just delivered the paper to the house that exploded. It was really lucky he wasn't hurt.
“The explosion threw bits of wood into the windows of the houses opposite, and all the cars have smashed windows.”
(Image: PA)
Margaret Burt, who lives opposite the house that was destroyed, recalled how she was in bed when she heard a "terrific bang".
She told the Mercury: "My bedroom windows blew in. It was terrifying. The whole house was gone.
“It's just a pile of rubble and next door lost a bedroom.”
Police, paramedics and firefighters were sent to the scene after reports of the "bang" - which has since been confirmed as a gas explosion.
Les Apse, who lives behind the house that blew up, claimed there was "talk yesterday of a smell of gas in the air".

He also said: “The blast of the explosion pushed all my windows in at the back and woke us up. I thought our boiler had exploded.
"Then there was the sound of things smashing into our roof.
“The wife started screaming and crying. There were tiles and bits of glass and window all over the street.”
(Image: PA)
Sarah Orton, 47, who lives a few doors down from the house, claimed there were two explosions before its roof "lit up red and orange".
She recalled: “I'd just left for work, and was a few doors away.
“There were two explosions. The first sounded like a firework, but it was a massive blast and I felt it push the back of my head.
“I turned around and saw the second explosion. The roof just lit up red and orange and things flew everywhere.

“I'm just in shock. I can't believe what I've seen. There's stuff all over the road. Our doors were blown in, and our windows too.”
Another local, Liam Owen, was delivering a newspaper to the opposite house, when the blast went off.
"I was delivering the paper to the house opposite and a few doors up. It felt like someone pushed me in the back," he said. “I thought, ‘What was that?'
“There was a flash of light and bits were flying through the air.
"I've never experienced anything like it.
“I didn't know if there might be any more explosions, so I didn't want to go too close. I called 999.
(Image: Leicester Mercury/BPM MEDIA)
“Right now I'm just not really thinking about it.
"If I'd been a bit earlier I could have been hurt.”
Neighbours reported seeing and hearing debris - including glass and window frames - being flung in all directions following the explosion.
Carol Cooke, 46, who lives nearby, said she awoke to an “almighty bang” before hearing emergency crews racing to the scene.
She added: “Hearing the bang was not nice. It was very scary. It's very shocking news, we are praying for the families involved.”
The fire service said it had received “multiple calls” about the incident.
Crews at the scene included three fire engines from Leicester stations, one from Birstall, a technical rescue team from Leicester and the command support vehicle from Shepshed station.

In a statement, Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed the semi-detached property had been involved in a gas explosion.
It said the main house had collapsed, while the neighbouring property had partially collapsed. Six other properties were partially affected.
The service said there was no fire reported and there is no smell of gas at this time. Full evacuation of surrounding homes has been carried out.
"It was terrifying... the whole house was gone"
Leicestershire Police also issued a statement on the incident.
It said earlier: “Officers are at an address in Allington Drive, Birstall, at 7.33am this morning following reports of a loud bang and house being damaged.
“Police, along with the fire and ambulance service, are at the scene. Investigations in to the cause of the damage are in their very early stages.
(Image: Leicester Mercury)
“Allington Drive is currently closed and is likely to remain so for a number of hours while inquiries are carried out.
“Two people are injured and are being attended to by paramedics. The nature of their injuries is not known at this time.
“A number of houses in the street have been evacuated as a precaution.”
Local Sarah Carr said she and her pals heard a loud bang, but initially believed it was snow falling off a building.
“It's just a pile of rubble and next door lost a bedroom"
The bang was also apparently heard by motorists and pedestrians at least an eight-minute drive away from the scene of the blast.
Some speculated whether the area may have been hit by an earthquake.
However, it was later confirmed it was a gas explosion.
A motorist driving in the area described hearing a "sort of dull thud in the distance" that was also noticed by pedestrians.
They said: “I was just passing the road where you turn off to get to the space centre when I heard a bang, a sort of dull thud in the distance.
"My son who was in the passenger seat asked what it was.
"A woman and a young girl crossing at traffic lights in front of us also turned round when they heard it. It was about 7.30am.”
Meanwhile, David Voce, 50, revealed how he thought his own house was falling down after hearing a bang.
He said: “I jumped out of bed when I heard the bang.
"It was incredibly loud. I thought my house was falling down. There was no fire, just an explosion. There have been loads of ambulances."
And Muriel Robertson, 75, recalled: “We just heard an almighty bang. There are quite a few houses damaged.
"I was asleep and I was woken up by the noise.”

Western Power Distributon, which has engineers on site, said just under 100 homes in the area would be without power for the morning.
A spokesman said after the explosion: “We have had to disconnect the electricity mains for safety reasons, which means there are about 95 properties in the area which will be without power for the rest of the morning.”
Minibuses provided by Charnwood Borough Council were seen taking people evacuated from their homes to locations nearby.
Roy Rollings, Charnwood Borough Council councillor for Birstall Wanlip, said: "We are aware of a large explosion at a property in Birstall.
"Our first thoughts are with all those involved. @CharnwoodBC emergency plans are being put into place to help all involved."
Charnwood Borough Council said: "We're aware of the incident in Birstall and supporting the emergency services.
"We will be ensuring residents' welfare is looked after and have officers on the scene, including from our building control team."
Gas network company Cadent told the Mercury it was “too early to speculate on the cause” of the explosion.
A spokesperson said: “Earlier this morning we were called to attend an incident in Allington Drive, Birstall, Leicester.
“We are currently on site and our priority at this time is to make safe and we are working with the emergency services to achieve this.
“It's too early to speculate on the cause at this time.”
The Perplexing Psychology Of Saving For Health Care

Spending your own money on health care might mean that you'll be more frugal with it. That's the theory behind health savings accounts, a decades-old GOP concept that's sparking renewed interest on Capitol Hill as Republican lawmakers look for ways to replace the Affordable Care Act.
HSAs are like personal savings accounts — with a difference. As with a retirement account, money put into an HSA can be invested, and any growth in the fund accumulates tax-free. Withdrawals can be made at any time, and they are tax-free, too — but the money can only be used to pay for certain medical expenses, such as health insurance deductibles, or for copays for hospital care or a visit to the doctor.
Currently, HSAs are only available to people who have high-deductible health plans, meaning they usually pay a few thousand dollars for medical care each year before their insurance kicks in to pay its share. While HSA participation is growing, only about 20 million people out of the 176 million who have health insurance participate in these savings accounts, according to a 2015 report by the Association of Health Insurance Plans.
Why don't more people who are eligible for HSAs have them? For one thing, not everyone has money to contribute upfront. But psychologists and behavioral economists point out that even many people who have the extra cash on hand confront big psychological barriers to saving.
"How we think and feel is directly tied to our ability to make 'good' financial decisions," says Alycia DeGraff, a board member and secretary of the Financial Therapy Association. DeGraff says when faced with financial decisions about the future, many people simply get stressed-out.
"These stressors can become so overwhelming that ... we can become debilitated and ignore the situation all together," she says. "Or we can practice any kind of defense mechanism — entitlement, suppression, overcompensation, isolation, etc. — to try and deal with [it]."
This may explain, at least in part, why middle-class Americans are pretty bad at saving money in general. Only about half of us have money in any sort of retirement account. And those of us who are parents have only saved, on average, enough to pay for about one year at an in-state college for our kids.
Saving money is hard. It means setting aside what we want now for something we think we'll want or need later. And we live in a culture that offers a lot of pretty, shiny, things to buy RIGHT NOW.
Plus, we all pretend we won't get old or sick.
"People are predictably irrational," says Dr. Mitesh Patel, especially when it comes to money. He's a behavioral economist, physician and assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.
But many of us really hate to lose money, Patel says, which is what makes the concept of HSAs is so appealing.
For example he and his colleagues published a study last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine on what motivates people to lose weight, and found that the way a financial incentive was framed made all the difference.
The researchers observed three groups of people for 13 weeks. They told one group to walk 7,000 steps a day. About 30 percent of the group did so. Meanwhile, people assigned to the second group were told they'd be paid $1.40 every day they walked 7,000 steps. About 35 percent of the second group did so.
Here's the kicker: Each person in the third group was paid $42 upfront and was docked $1.40 each time they failed to meet their goal. Forty-five percent of that group met the assigned goal, Patel says. People hate to lose money.
Another way to encourage more saving might be to make HSAs operate more like the 401(k)s that required people who didn't want to participate to actively opt out of the plan — rather than requiring people who want to contribute to opt in. "This creates a path of the least resistance," Patel says.
Of course, setting up and overseeing such a plan would likely cost the government some money, he notes.
People with HSAs do use less health care than those without such plans, a recent study from the Employee Benefits Research Institute suggests. But it's unclear whether they actually improve their health. Prescription drug costs went down for people enrolled in HSAs in the EBRI study, but emergency room visits went up — particularly for lower-income families.
Then there's the issue of figuring out how much you, as an individual or a family, would need to save for health care — it's not easy to find out the average price for a medical test or procedure in your town, let alone how much that price varies from doctor to doctor or hospital to hospital.
"If you want to save for a house, you can pretty much figure out the math," Patel says. "But if you go to a doctor, they don't give you a menu for prices."
To really increase their health savings — or any savings — we'd all need to change our mindset, says Degraff, the financial therapist.
"People would have to first take a dose of reality and get real about their future selves," she says. Naturally, we thing our future selves will be "better, healthier, more financially secure," she adds. But, for many of us, health and income eventually decline with age. We need to save more now for later.
HSAs can be useful, Degraff notes, but only for those who have enough cash to pay their day-to-day expenses — plus a little left over.
"A lot of people don't even have a regular emergency fund savings," DeGraff says, "especially those that are already struggling to pay for health insurance."
