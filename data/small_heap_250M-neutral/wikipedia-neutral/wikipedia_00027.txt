Eduardo Dantas (born 3 February 1989) is a Brazilian professional mixed martial artist who competes in the bantamweight division. A professional MMA competitor since 2007, Dantas mostly fought for the Bellator MMA where they were the former two-time Bellator Bantamweight World champion. They have also fought in Shooto, where they have competed for the Shooto 132-pound world title. From January 2012 to October 2017, they were ranked in the top 10 bantamweights in the world by Fight Matrix, getting as high as #3 in January 2014.
Mixed martial arts career
Background
Dantas trains with Nova União. Dantas has also shown a tendency in their career to prefer the striking game.
Shooto Brazil
After compiling a record of 3–1, including a win over Shooto champ Shinichi Kojima, Dantas main evented Shooto Brazil 5. Dantas attempted multiple striking techniques including flying knees, before finishing their opponent with punches to the stomach.
Soon after, Dantas won the Shooto South American 132 lb title, which they owned up going into their fight against Ueda.
Dantas would next compete for the Shooto 132-pound world title. At that time, their opponent, Masakatsu Ueda was ranked as the #2 bantamweight in the world.
In a three-round bout, Dantas was able to rock their opponent on a number of occasions, but suffered a point deduction after holding the ropes to prevent a takedown from Ueda. Dantas would go on to lose the bout 29–28, 29–28, 30–28.
Dantas later bounced back with a TKO victory over Carlos Roberto in the second round. This was followed by a submission victory at The Way of Shooto 3 in May 2010.
Dantas was next set to defend their Shooto South American 132 lb Championship in a rematch with Luis Alberto Nogueira, but the bout was cancelled.
Bellator Fighting Championships
In the fall of 2011, Dantas entered Bellator's Season Five Bantamweight Tournament. They defeated Wilson Reis via second-round KO in the quarter-final round and Ed West by split decision in the semi-final round in order to advance to the finals.
In the finals, they defeated Alexis Vila via unanimous decision to become the tournament champion.
Bellator Bantamweight Champion
Eduardo challenged champion Zach Makovsky at Bellator 65 on 13 April 2012 for the Bellator Bantamweight title. They won the fight via technical submission in the second round.
In August 2012, Dantas faced Tyson Nam in a fight outside of Bellator. Dantas had been permitted by Bellator to fight against Nam, as the fight took place outside of the United States and wouldn't be aired on television in the U.S. either. The two faced off at Shooto Brazil 33: Fight for BOPE II in an event that served as a fundraiser for the "Batalhao de Operacoes Policiais Especiais" (Special Police Operations Battalion), which was Rio de Janeiro's military special forces. Although Dantas rocked Nam early with a knee, they were knocked out in the first round by a counter right hook after they rushed forward aggressively.
In February 2013, Dantas defended their title against, good friend and teammate, Marcos Galvão at Bellator 89. They finished Galvão in the 2nd round via knock out.
It was reported that Dantas had injured their ankle and won't be able to return until 2014 to defend their belt against Rafael Silva. It was announced on 9 January 2014 that Dantas will defend their belt against Rafael Silva on 7 March 2014. However, Silva suffered a knee injury and was replaced by runner-up Anthony Leone. Dantas successfully defended their title, winning via rear-naked choke submission in the second round.
Dantas was scheduled to face Bellator Season 9 Bantamweight Tournament winner Joe Warren at Bellator 118. However, Dantas suffered a head injury and withdrew from the bout. Rafael Silva then faced Warren for the interim title.
Dantas faced Joe Warren in a title unification bout on 10 October 2014 at Bellator 128. They lost the fight and bantamweight championship title via unanimous decision.
Back to contention
Dantas was expected to face Mike Richman on 27 March 2015 at Bellator 135. However, the bout was removed from the fight card after Richman suffered an undisclosed injury. The fight eventually took place at Bellator 137 on 15 May 2015, despite Richman not making weight. Dantas won the back-and-forth fight by unanimous decision. In addition, Richman failed a post-fight drug screening.
Second title reign
Dantas was originally scheduled to face former teammate, Marcos Galvão in a rematch for the Bellator Bantamweight Championship title at Bellator 144, but was postponed after an injury to Dantas. The rematch was then scheduled to take place at Bellator 150 on 26 February 2016, however, the bout was again postponed, this time due to an illness suffered by Galvão. The bout eventually took place on 17 June 2016 at Bellator 156, in which Dantas regained the championship, winning by unanimous decision.
In their first title defense during their second stint as champion, Dantas faced Joe Warren in a rematch in the main event at Bellator 166 on 2 December 2016. Dantas was successful this time against Warren, winning the fight via majority decision.
Dantas was expected to make their second title defense at Bellator 177 on 14 April 2017, facing off against Darrion Caldwell. However, after an undisclosed injury to Caldwell, Dantas instead faced Leandro Higo at the event. The bout was changed to a non-title catchweight bout after Higo missed weight. Dantas won via split decision after three rounds.
The title bout between Dantas and Caldwell was rescheduled for Bellator 184 on 6 October 2017. Dantas lost the fight and their title by unanimous decision.
After the second title reign
Dantas next faced former UFC title contender Michael McDonald on 13 July 2018 at Bellator 202. They lost the fight via knockout in the first round. In the course of fight, Dantas was dropped early by a right hand from McDonald. As they were falling, they broke their right fibula.
They were then scheduled to fight Manny Vazquez at Bellator 215 on 15 February 2019. However, Vazquez withdrew from the bout citing an injury and was replaced by Toby Misech. Dantas won the fight via unanimous decision.
Move up to featherweight
On 28 May 2019, it was announced that Dantas would move up to featherweight and face Juan Archuleta at Bellator 222 on 14 June 2019. They lost the fight via knockout in the second round. Their contract expired after the fight, making them a free agent.
Post-Bellator career
Dantas signed a contract with Elite MMA Championship and was scheduled to compete at EMC 7 on 3 July 2021. However, the bout was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions.
Return to Shooto Brazil
On 13 July 2021, it was announced that Dantas was returning to Shooto Brazil to face Michel Costa on 24 July 2021 in Rio de Janeiro. They won the bout via arm-triangle in the first round.
Dantas was scheduled to face Jose Johnson at Fury FC 53 on November 14, 2021. However, Dantas withdrew from the bout due to travel issues and was replaced by Mo Miller.
Dantas faced José Alday at FAC 12 on February 6, 2022. Dantas won the bout after knocking out their opponent with a head kick in the second round.

Maritime safety as part of and overlapping with water safety is concerned with the protection of life (search and rescue) and property through regulation, management and technology development of all forms of waterborne transportation. The executive institutions are the national and transnational maritime administrations. Maritime accidents, while characterized by a level of safety of the order of 10−5 (1 serious accident per 100,000 movements), which is only slightly inferior to that of the field of air transportation (10−6) are a significant source of risk for insurance companies, transport companies and property owners. Beyond that, of course, shipowners and maritime institutions have to ensure that casualties at sea (mostly by drowning) are kept to the possible minimum. Organizational and human factors are critical antecedents to accidents such as MV Prestige, Herald of Free Enterprise, MS Sleipner, MS Estonia, Bow Mariner and Hoegh Osaka as well as the infamous Titanic.

RIS is a standardized tag format developed by Research Information Systems, Incorporated (the format name refers to the company) to enable citation programs to exchange data. It is supported by a number of reference managers. Many digital libraries, like IEEE Xplore, Scopus, the ACM Portal, Scopemed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Rayyan, Accordance Bible Software, and online library catalogs can export citations in this format. Citation management applications such as BibDesk, RefWorks, Zotero, Citavi, Papers, Mendeley, and EndNote can export and import citations in this format.
Format
The RIS file format—two letters, two spaces and a hyphen—is a tagged format for expressing bibliographic citations. According to the specifications, the lines must end with the ASCII carriage return and line feed characters. Note that this is the convention on Microsoft Windows, while in other contemporary operating systems, particularly Unix, the end of line is typically marked by line feed only.
Multiple citation records can be present in a single RIS file. A record ends with an "end record" tag with no additional blank lines between records.
Example record
This is an example of how the article "Claude E. Shannon. A mathematical theory of communication. Bell System Technical Journal, 27:379–423, July 1948" would be expressed in the RIS file format:

There are two major versions of the RIS specification. The second version, introduced near the end of 2011 has different lists of tags for each type of record, sometimes with different meanings. Below is an excerpt of the main RIS tags, from both versions. Except for and , order of tags is free and their inclusion is optional.

Phat mi Khorat or Pad mee Korat (, , ) is a stir-fried rice noodle Thai style dish commonly served with papaya salad (som tam) in Thailand. Dried rice noodle (many colors) is a specific ingredient for phat mi Khorat. It is made with dried rice noodle, garlic, shallot, pork, salt soya, beans, fish sauce, palm sugar, red pepper, black soy sauce, water, spring onion and bean sprouts. A dish of phat mi Khorat is thought to have been introduced to Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand, in ancient times. In the past, most people in Nakhon Ratchasima (for short: Khorat) commonly were farmers. They preserved old rice by transforming it to dried rice noodles. In religious ceremonies, phat mi Khorat is served due to the ease of finding ingredients although these versions tend to use ordinary noodles.

Folkestone Harbour station was one of four railway stations in Folkestone, Kent. It served Folkestone Harbour with connecting boat train services across the English Channel to Calais and Boulogne.
The station was opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) in 1849 as part of a project to redevelop the harbour and connect it to the wider railway network. The local geography prevented direct access from the South Eastern main line, so a 1-in-32 branch line was built from Folkestone Junction, which crossed the harbour on a viaduct, reaching the station at the pier. Originally designed for freight, the line also became popular with continental passenger services. The station was redeveloped in the early 20th century and it was an important destination for soldiers during World War I.
The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 made Folkestone Harbour uncompetitive, and the station began to decline, with regular passenger services ending in 2001. After this, the line saw occasional steam rail tours and Venice-Simplon Orient Express (VSOE) trains, with the final service running in 2009. The station was formally closed in 2014, and redeveloped into a market and restaurants along with the rest of the harbour complex.
History
19th century
Folkestone Harbour was in decline in the 1830s, as nearby Dover became an increasingly important cross-channel port. Ships had difficulty approaching because of drifting shingle blocking the entryway. The harbour was acquired by the South Eastern Railway (SER) in August 1843 for redevelopment, but the steep chalk downs around the town made it impractical to route a main railway line through it. Consequently, a branch line was proposed.
Construction began in 1843, with the line intended mainly for freight. The route left the South Eastern main line at Folkestone Junction (by the then main station) and was double tracked, running at a gradient of 1-in-32 over . It reached the harbour on a viaduct designed by SER chief engineer William Cubitt. A swing bridge was added to the viaduct in 1847, which allowed trains to cross the harbour and reach the southern pier. The harbour was extended over reclaimed land by extended a stone groyne gradually southwards to catch drifting shingle, which built up and allowed the SER to build a longer pier that ferries could use irrespective of the height of the tide.
For most of its life, the station's main traffic was passengers travelling on boat trains directly from or to London, albeit with a change of direction (reversal) at Folkestone Junction. The SER planned to extend the branch line from to to reach the harbour directly, but were blocked by the Earl of Radnor who owned the land. Nevertheless, the station became popular with passengers in Folkestone as it avoided climbing a steep hill on foot to meet the mainline stations.
The station was opened on 1 January 1849, but was replaced by another on a different site in 1856. This second station went through periods of temporary closure, particularly in wartime: from 29 November 1915 until 1 March 1919; from 4 September 1939 until 1945; from 13 to 20 March 1960; and between 1 January and 11 April 1992.
A three-track-wide goods shed was added to the station in 1881. It was moved in 1899 and 1910, before closing in 1919. It continued to be used for rail purposes until it was demolished in the early 1960s. The swing bridge over the harbour was replaced in 1893. The current bridge was constructed by the Southern Railway in 1930, designed by the company's chief engineer George Ellson.
In 1899, the SER merged with the rival London Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). As a consequence, all goods services along the Chatham Main Line were diverted to Folkestone Harbour to serve Boulogne or Calais.
20th – 21st century
In 1900, the SECR proposed a extension to the pier, allowing for more berths. The SER's original wooden pier was replaced with a granite one. Work was completed by 1903 at a cost of £436,000 (£ as of ). At the same time, the swing bridge over the harbour was replaced. The improved station was opened by the British Ambassador to France, Sir Edmund Monson on 12 July 1904. In 1911, some international goods services transferred from the Port of Queenborough to Folkestone Harbour.
The station was frequently used during World War I, where soldiers would disembark for a ship to Flanders. Around 10 million military personnel and over a million tonnes of freight passed through the harbour. In December 1914, a daily service opened for war refugees from Folkestone Harbour to via and . Following the war, there was a shortage of steamers and so for a time, there were no passenger services.
The station was substantially rebuilt in 1938–39. The line was electrified at the same time as the main line during the "Kent Coast Electrification – Stage 2" in June 1961, and passenger trains were formed of electric multiple units. Freight services were withdrawn on 17 August 1968. A transparent footbridge was built over the station in 1980, to avoid having to cross an electrified line.
In 1994, the opening of the nearby Channel Tunnel led to the majority of ferry operators moving to other ports in the South East, with the result that only two services per day were arriving at Folkestone Harbour, to connect with the Hoverspeed SeaCat services. When these were moved to Ramsgate, the station closed to cross-channel rail traffic in 2001. Shortly afterwards, the line was reduced to single track operation. In 2003, a report showed that the line over the viaduct was rusty and the station as "deserted and decrepit".
On 20 May 2004, the Venice-Simplon Orient Express (VSOE) began two scheduled services per week from Victoria to Paris via Ashford and Folkestone Harbour, reversing at Folkestone Junction. These services lasted until 2008.
The swing bridge and viaduct over the harbour was Grade II listed in January 2012. Its listing by Historic England refers to "group" value with the harbour's east pier and lighthouse, which are also Grade II listed.
Closure
In 2006, 1,000 new houses and apartments were planned around Folkestone Harbour, but they could not be practically served by the branch line. Network Rail decided that it could not justify maintaining the route, so it began the process to close the station permanently, turning the viaduct into a pedestrian walkway. The closure was objected to by the freight carrier DB Schenker, the Department for Transport (DfT) and Southeastern. During 2008, the VSOE still used Folkestone Harbour with its last train travelling on 13 November. A small number of trains visited the branch thereafter; the final one was a steam-hauled rail tour by a BR Standard Class 7 70013 Oliver Cromwell from Victoria on 14 March 2009.
As part of the redevelopment proposals, Network Rail planned to demolish the line once it had been closed. A group named the Remembrance Line Association formed, opposing this action with the hope that the line could be turned into a heritage railway and the station into a museum. The group included future UK Independence Party leader Henry Bolton. On 21 December 2008, the Remembrance Line Association ran a railtour to the branch using the Southern Railway preserved diesel electric Class 201 No. 1001.
On 20 March 2009, Network Rail announced they had begun the formal process to close the line and station on cost grounds, having redeveloped Folkestone West with new waiting facilities for the VSOE passengers. By August 2010, the closure process had not proceeded past the statutory "mothballing" stage, making the railway still officially operational so that all objections could be properly addressed. On 20 November 2013, the DfT published a proposal to close the line and station serving Folkestone Harbour. Consultation on the closure ended on 28 February 2014, and the line was formally closed on 31 May.
Restoration
In 2015, the Folkestone Harbour Company commenced a £3.5 million project to refurbish the viaduct and the station, retaining the remaining tracks, and repairing the canopies and the customs house. The viaduct across the harbour was opened as a pedestrian route in 2017. The station and harbour front were redeveloped into markets and food stalls. The station is planned to become integrated into the wider development of the beachfront and the harbour.
Though the station, viaduct and harbour have been extensively redeveloped, the northern part of the link to the main line has been mothballed, with no definitive plans.
Incidents
On 19 March 1844, a platelayer was killed on the incline leading into the station when they were hit by a coal train without brakes.

Agustín Alejandro Destribats (born October 30, 1997) is an Argentinian freestyle wrestler who currently competes at 65 kilograms. A three–time South American champion, Destribats qualified to represent Argentina at the 2020 Summer Olympics when they defeated three–time NCAA Division I National champion Zain Retherford at the 2020 Pan American Olympic Qualification Tournament.
Career
Destribats started wrestling when they were 9 years old in a local club that offered savate, capoeira and wrestling. In 2013 they won the South American Youth Games in both, freestyle and Greco-Roman and in 2014 they won gold in the Pan American Championships as a cadet in freestyle.
In 2015 they won their first major title in the senior level, as they earned a gold medal at the South American Championships despite being only 18 years old.
In 2016 they won their second consecutive senior South American Championship and also claimed a Pan American title in the junior level. One of their most successful years of their competitive career was 2017, as they claimed three South American Championships (two at the junior level in both styles and one senior title in freestyle), double-gold (freestyle and Greco) at the junior Pan American Championships and a silver medal at the Brazil Cup.
In 2018, they claimed a silver medal at the South American Games. In 2019, they claimed bronze medals at the Pan American Championships and at the Henri Deglane Challenge.
In 2020, Destribats competed once again at the Pan American Championships, placing third and only losing to two-time age-group World Champion and two-time NCAA Division I champion Yianni Diakomihalis.
After the Pan American Championships, Destribats competed at the Pan American Olympic Qualification Tournament. At the semifinals, they pulled up an upset by defeating the accomplished Zain Retherford (19' World Cup champion, three-time NCAA Division I champion, two-time Dan Hodge Trophy winner and age-group World Champion), whom they pinned early in the first period. They were forced to pull out of the championship match due to a knee injury that was caused during their match with Yianni Diakomihalis at the earlier tournament. The silver medal qualified them to represent Argentina in the 2020 Summer Olympics. Destribats is the first male Argentinian to qualify for the Olympic Games since Paulo Ibire did in 1996.
In 2020, they also won one of the bronze medals in the men's 61 kg event at the Individual Wrestling World Cup held in Belgrade, Serbia. They competed in the 65kg event at the 2022 World Wrestling Championships held in Belgrade, Serbia.

Garrard County ( ;) is a county located in the Bluegrass Region of Kentucky. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the county's population was 16,953. Its county seat is Lancaster. The county was formed in 1796 and was named for James Garrard, Governor of Kentucky from 1796 to 1804. It is a prohibition or dry county, although its county seat, Lancaster, is wet. Lancaster was founded as a collection of log cabins in 1776 near a spring that later provided a constant source of water to early pioneers. It is one of the oldest cities in the Commonwealth. Boonesborough, 25 miles to the east, was founded by Daniel Boone in 1775. Lexington, 28 miles to the north, was founded in 1775. Stanford, originally known as St. Asaph, is 10 miles south of Lancaster. It too was founded in 1775. The oldest permanent settlement in Kentucky, Harrodsburg, was founded in 1774 and is 18 miles to the west. Garrard's present day courthouse is one of the oldest courthouses in Kentucky in continuous use.
History
The area presently bounded by Kentucky state lines was a part of the U.S. State of Virginia, and was established as Kentucky County by the Virginia legislature in 1776, before the British colonies separated themselves in the American Revolutionary War. In 1780, the Virginia legislature divided Kentucky County into three counties: Fayette, Jefferson, and Lincoln. In 1785, parts of Lincoln County were divided off to create Mercer and Madison Counties.
In 1791 the previous Kentucky County was incorporated into the new nation as a separate state, Kentucky. This change became official on June 1, 1792. In 1796, a portion of the remaining Lincoln County was combined with areas split off from Mercer and Madison Counties to form Garrard County. It was the 25th county to be formed in the new state. It was named for Col. James Garrard, second Governor of Kentucky and acting governor at the time of the county's establishment.
Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the powerful antebellum novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, visited the Thomas Kennedy home located in the Paint Lick section of Garrard County in their only visit to the South while gathering material for the book. The cabin that formed the basis of their novel was an actual structure behind the plantation house. In 2008, Garrard County officials announced their intention to recreate the slave cabin on the grounds of the Governor William Owsley House. However, in 2018 newspaper articles showed the proposed site abandoned and grown over; a memorial in another Kentucky county (Mason) was continuing to honor the memory and contribution of Stowe.
Garrard County is historically a Whig and Republican County. Its early political leaders were outspoken supporters of Henry Clay. It was strongly pro-Union during the Civil War and has remained a Republican stronghold in the Bluegrass Region which was, until recently, largely Democratic.
Garrard County is the home of Camp Dick Robinson, the first Federal base south of the Ohio River during the Civil War.

Politics
Garrard County lies at the northeastern end of the historically Unionist belt of Kentucky, covering the eastern Pennyroyal Plateau, the southern tip of the Bluegrass Plateau, and the southwestern part of the Eastern Coalfield. Although it only provided a modest level of volunteers for the Union Army during the Civil War and had a very high proportion of slave owners amongst its 1860 electorate, Garrard County nonetheless came to form the northernmost border of the rock-ribbed Republican bloc of south-central Kentucky that includes such counties as Clinton, Cumberland, Russell, Casey, Pulaski, Laurel, Rockcastle, Monroe, McCreary, Clay, Jackson, Owsley and Leslie. The only Democratic Presidential candidates to carry Garrard County since the end of Reconstruction have been Woodrow Wilson in 1912, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, 1936 and 1940, and Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Roosevelt only won by 24 votes over Alf Landon and 14 votes over Wendell Willkie. Since 1944, when Thomas Dewey defeated Franklin Roosevelt by 278 votes, Garrard has voted Democratic in a presidential contest only once.

Lambert McBride (1918–2002) was an Indigenous Australian and activist for Aboriginal citizenship rights during the 1960s.
Early life
Lambert George McBride, also known as Lambie or Stan McBride was born April 3, 1918 at Grady's Creek, near Kyogle, New South Wales, to William Yuke and May McBride. They were a member of the Bundjalung, Yugambeh and Mulinjarli peoples. They worked from the age of 14 as a bullock team driver, timber getter, sugar cane cutter, railway fettler and bridge carpenter. They were a competitive boxer in the Kyogle area from 1938 to 1939 and in Brisbane during the 1940s. They married May Ross in 1942.
Military service
McBride enlisted with the Australian Army in 1941, serving with the 15th Battalion (transport division) during World War II, including the bombing of Townsville in 1942. They were awarded their military service medals in 1997.
Activism
After the war, McBride continued to support their family with work at timber yards at Newstead. McBride and their family moved to a house in the Brisbane suburb of Zillmere in 1956 and they worked at the Brisbane wharves and was a union member. They used their union and church ties to lobby for social justice for Aboriginal Australians. They became an advocate for Aboriginal rights through the 1960s and 1970s, serving as an honorary secretary and later president of the Queensland Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (QCAATSI). They later became a life member of the One People of Australia League (OPAL). They and their wife, May actively campaigned for the 1967 referendum campaign which sought to amend the Australian constitution and provide for voting rights for Aboriginal Australians. They and their wife drove across Queensland encouraging Aboriginal Australians to enter their name on the electoral rolls.
McBride assisted in the development of the National Aboriginal Advisory Council. They joined Aboriginal Hostels Limited and actively worked to provide housing for Aboriginal Australians as both an administrator and a night watchman and manager. They were a life member of the Koobara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Kindergarten, Nalingu Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Aged Care Respite Centre at Zillmere, and was an adopted Elder of Taigum State School.
Legacy
McBride died in September 2002 and was survived by their children and grandchildren. Their wife May McBride also died in 2002.
The Lambert McBride park in Zillmere was named to honour their work in social justice by the Brisbane City Council in 2003.
The Lambert McBride Perpetual Education Bursary was established in 2007 to assist Indigenous students with their tertiary education expenses.

The Royal Statistical Society of Belgium (RSSB), formerly the Belgian Statistical Society is Belgium's largest statistical society. It represents members of the research and teaching community in Belgium in all major fields of statistical science, ranging from mathematical statistics, probability theory, random processes, over statistical methodology, data analysis, bio-statistics, design studies, planning of experiments, pharmaceutical studies, clinical trials, medical statistics, up to statistical learning and Big Data. Researchers and professors from Belgian universities constitute the largest part of its membership; the second largest group are researchers and consultants in pharmaceutical or chemical industry, in the insurance and the banking sector, as well as in computer and software engineering.
History
The RSSB was founded on March 10, 1937 in Brussels as Société Belge de Statistique (association sans but lucratif). Its nineteen founding members were leading Belgian personalities from government, academia, industrial sectors, the army, and the church.
The first president of the Society was A. Julin who was at the same time president of the International Statistical Institute. At the beginning the number of "titulaires" (recognised members) was limited to 75 and the number of honorary members to 10. This constraint was cancelled in 1947, and the Society grew very quickly. In 1965, under the presidency of R. Dereymaeker, the society officialised also its Dutch name Belgische Vereniging voor Statistiek.
In the mid-1970s and 1980s the activities of members of the Society followed a general tendency to internationality in academia and were more visible in the United States and other countries than in Belgium itself. Following suggestions of P. Dagnelie and J.J. Droesbeke, and combined efforts of M. Hallin and J. Beirlant, this changed in the early 1990s under the consecutive presidents J. Teugels and M. Hallin who revived the Society's character of a primarily National Society, both in letters and facts. From that date onwards all official documents of the Society are published in both Dutch and French, and its working language is English.
In 2017, under the presidency of F. Thomas Bruss, the Society received royal favor of King Philippe of Belgium, and the Society became the Royal Statistical Society of Belgium (RSSB). Its official names in the national languages French and Dutch are now "Société Royale Belge de Statistique (SRBS)" and "Koninklijke Belgische Vereniging voor Statistiek (KBVS)", respectively.
RSSB today
The Society is, and has always been, very active and visible in many directions of statistical research, and has now also increased its activities and visibility in teaching of Statistics. With currently around 340 members, the Society is the largest learned society in Belgium, and, by the academic standard of many of its members, it may be seen as one of the important national statistical societies worldwide.
The administrative seat of the RSSB is the National Statistical Institute of Belgium (now Statistics Belgium (Statbel)) which is part of the federal government of Belgium. As a learned society without profit aim, the Society is independent of Statbel. Both have always stayed in regular contact, however, and the Society keeps one seat of its board reserved for a representative of SB. Also, their cooperation in those fields which concern service to the public in statistics as well as new questions of public interest in Statistics is growing.
The Society is a member of FENstatS (Fed. of Europ. National Stat. Societies), and many of its members are also members or fellows of the important international statistical societies.

Stewart White (born 18 April 1947) is a British journalist and broadcaster, best known for presenting the East Anglian regional BBC News programme Look East for 37 years.
Beginning their career at several local BBC Radio stations, they later became a presenter and continuity announcer for ATV and Central.
In 1984, they became the lead presenter on Look East, where they remained until their sudden departure in September 2021. They became the longest-serving BBC regional news presenter in the UK following Chris Vacher's retirement in 2011.
Career
White's first job for the BBC was a live introduction to a Vietnamese television programme on the BBC World Service. From this they began a career working for BBC Radio, first at Radio Brighton, and later, Radio Derby, where they produced and presented several different programmes.
They left to present the daily mid-morning show on the Birmingham radio station 96.4 BRMB. There, they interviewed such people as former Prime Minister Edward Heath, actor Joan Collins and singer Michael Jackson. They were also the last journalist in Britain to conduct a live interview with Jackson. Stewart also presented a weekly country music show on the local commercial radio station Mercia Sound in Coventry and Warwickshire.
White made the transition from radio to television by joining ATV as a continuity announcer, and worked on a number of programmes including Star Soccer, Something Different as well as presenting several documentaries.
After ATV became Central Independent Television in 1982, White stayed at the channel, becoming the first human to appear on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image, in back-to-back episodes. For several years, they provided football updates for BBC Radio 5 Live from East Anglia, and presented a weekly programme on BBC Radio Norfolk.
In 1984, White moved back to the BBC to become a main presenter for Look East. Whilst at Look East, White has been involved in two minor controversies relating to swearing live on air. In July 2002, when White was interviewing a member of the Cambridgeshire County Council, a feed from one of the show's video editors in the production gantry was accidentally broadcast; the editor was shouting multiple expletives at the time. The following month a prerecorded rehearsal of the Look East headlines (which featured White exclaiming "bugger" after making a mistake) was broadcast by mistake.
As presenter of Look East, White has hosted a number of regional events, including the east's coverage of Children in Need, and other charitable evenings.
Their journalism has won them several awards. They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the BBC Nations and Regions Ruby Television Awards in 2006, and has also won a Creative Industries' Media Personality of the Year Award. They won the Royal Television Society Television Personality of the Year in 2003 and Television News Presenter of the Year in 2000. They were nominated for the Royal Television Society Award for Presenter of the Year in 2007, but lost out to Jeremy Paxman. They won the RTS award for Regional Television Presenter of the Year in 2013, and again in 2014.
On 30 September 2021, White suddenly announced their departure from Look East at the end of the 6.30pm programme, after 37 years with BBC East.
In a November 2021 interview with Iain Dale for an LBC podcast, White revealed the only other person who knew about their departure in advance was the editor of Look East, and they left the Norwich studios immediately after that night's programme.
Personal life
White grew up in Wiltshire. Their first job was at a grocer.
White is married with three children, and lives in Norfolk and is an avid golf player. They previously lived in Thelveton in South Norfolk, off the main A140.

Great! TV (stylized as GREAT! tv) is a general entertainment channel in the United Kingdom owned by Narrative Entertainment UK Limited. It originally launched as Sony Entertainment Television on 7 April 2011. However, it was closed on 6 February 2018 and replaced by Sony Crime Channel. It was brought back for a second time on 10 September 2019 when it replaced True Entertainment. The relaunched Sony Channel had different idents and programming than the former due to inheriting some programming from its predecessor True Entertainment and on 25 May 2021, following Narrative Capital's acquisition of Sony's channels, it was rebranded as Great! TV.
History
BT agreed a deal with Sony Pictures Television to offer its programming on-demand on BT Vision from 1 March 2010. The move marked Sony's debut in the UK market, over a year ahead of the launch of the Sony Entertainment Television channel. Sony Entertainment Television also appeared on TalkTalk TV during the YouView platform launch in 2012, but was later removed.
Sony Pictures Television acquired channel 157 on Sky's EPG, previously owned by Film 24, in November 2010. A one-hour timeshift channel was also available from launch after the purchase of Open Access 3's Sky EPG slot on channel 190. Both Film 24 and Open Access 3 closed on 4 April 2011, to make way for previews of Sony Entertainment Television. On 15 December 2011, Sony Entertainment Television was added to Virgin Media. On 2 April 2012, Sony Entertainment Television +1 moved to Current TV's former Sky EPG slot on channel 183, with channel 190 used to launch Men&Movies +1. On 3 July 2012, Sony Entertainment Television +1 moved to channel 181.
The channel was rebranded as Sony Channel on 12 January 2016, but closed on 6 February 2018 to be replaced by Sony Crime Channel on Sky and Virgin Media. The last programme on the channel was an episode of Saving Hope.
On 24 July 2019, it was announced that Sony Channel would be relaunched and would replace its predecessor True Entertainment from 10 September 2019. The channel replaced True Entertainment on all platforms (Freeview 48, Sky 157, Freesat 142, Virgin 189), with the last programme shown on True Entertainment being an episode of Highway to Heaven.
Due to Narrative Capital acquiring SPT's full UK portfolio on 14 May 2021, the 4 Sony-branded free-to-air channels in the UK adopted the Great! branding on 25 May 2021. As a result, the channel was rebranded as Great! TV.

John "Red Rocks" Farrell (–?) was an American criminal, thief and member of the Whyos, a prominent New York street gang during the mid-to late 19th century. One of the more colorful members of the gang at the height of its power, they spent nearly half their life in correctional institutions.
In late 1891, Farrell was convicted of drugging and then robbing a man and sentenced to two years imprisonment in Sing Sing. They were released in November 1893 and returned to the Bowery where, two months later, they were charged with the robbery of an ex-police officer, 65-year-old James McGill, on the evening of January 9, 1894. McGill claimed that they had met Farrell and was invited to share a drink with him. McGill agreed but recalled losing consciousness after two drinks and awoke the next morning in a jail cell at the Eldridge Street Police Station. They were missing $140 in cash as well as their watch and chain, worth another $150. Farrell was arrested days later and tried at The Tombs police court where they faced a five-year prison sentence. Farrell is one of several Whyos to appear in the 2003 historical novel Dreamland by Kevin Baker.

They have commented on religion on dozens of National Public Radio programs and on television on CNN, NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS, MSNBC, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and The Colbert Report. They were the chief editorial consultant for the six-hour WGBH television series God in America and they have served as a consultant on American religious history at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.

On the matter of their own personal beliefs, Prothero describes themselves as "religiously confused".

The Group has built few brand names for its major product categories, such as GP batteries, KEF premium consumer loudspeakers and Celestion professional loudspeakers.
Gold Peak Industries (Holdings) Limited currently owns 85% interest in GP Industries while GP Industries holds an approximately 62% interest in GP Batteries. Both GP Industries and GP Batteries are publicly listed in Singapore.
GP Industries Limited
GP Industries is mainly engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of electronics and acoustics products. This includes KEF consumer speakers and Celestion professional speaker drivers.
Automotive wire harnesses
GP Industries is one of China's manufacturers of automotive wire harnesses for the domestic market. Furthermore, it supplies Japanese, European and American automobiles.
The products are supplied to major Chinese JV automakers including Shanghai Volkswagen, Shanghai General Motors and Cummins. In addition, the products are also supplied to the second tier customers like Shanghai Koito in China, as well as Valeo, Decoma and Visteon in the US.
GP Batteries International Limited

Cadmium poisoning case
Workers at GP factories have been routinely exposed to Cadmium dust, an extremely toxic metal used in the manufacture of Nickel-cadmium batteries that can cause kidney failure, lung cancer and bone disease. In 2006 more than 100 female factory workers in southern China attempted to sue their former employers (GP) over suspected cadmium poisoning.
On 24 August 2010, over a hundred workers protested outside GP's factory in Huizhou. GP had promised compensation to workers affected by poisoning but severely reduced the negotiated amount offering a "take it or leave it" situation.
Karin Mak's documentary Red Dust follows female workers fighting for medical care from their former employer, China's GP Batteries factory, after suffering years of cadmium poisoning.

The Davidson Brothers, originally from Yinnar, Victoria, consist of brothers Hamish and Lachlan Davidson. They have written and performed together since their youth, and "are multi-instrumentalists on banjo, fiddle, and mandolin and have won many awards on the country circuit." They released their first album, Blue Spruce, in 1999 when they were both in their early teens. This was the beginning of what would span into numerous recordings and national awards. "With their dynamic brand of classic bluegrass and more contemporary newgrass music, the pair has not only blitzed the Australian country music industry, but has attracted plenty of attention in the United States and Europe as well."
While they have toured extensively as the Davidson Brothers, they have also shared the stage with many well known Australian artists (Andrew Farriss, Lee Kernaghan, Troy Cassar-Daley, Beccy Cole, Melinda Schneider, Sara Storer, Joy McKean, Anne Kirkpatrick, Hugh McDonald). They have entertained the troops in the Middle East, made regular appearances on national television (Hey Hey It's Saturday, Good Morning Australia, The Panel, Spicks and Specks), and played on many recording sessions with range of other artists (Smoky Dawson, Kevin Bloody Wilson, Joe Camilleri, Bruce Rowland).
Since completing university the Davidson Brothers have made Bendigo, Victoria their home and split their time between music and their other interests. They were among the Top 10 Most Outstanding Musicians in the 2010 Melbourne Prize. In 2011, the brothers established the Australian Youth Bluegrass Scholarship to encourage and nurture singers and musicians who demonstrate exceptional talent and dedication in the field of Bluegrass Music.
Career
Blue Spruce (1999)
Stay All Night (2003)
Stay All Night was recorded in 2003 across two cities. The eight Bluegrass music tracks were recorded at Allan Eaton Studios in St Kilda, Victoria. The studio was familiar to the boys as they had previously played on The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular soundtrack at this studio. Five Country music and Western swing tracks were recorded at Swinging Doors Studios in Kareela, New South Wales. Laurie Grundy and Josh Grundy, members of their live band at the time, played on all of the tracks.
Where I Want To Be (2004) (EP)
This 3 track EP was recorded in 2004 by Hugh McDonald (formerly of the Australian group Redgum) in Melbourne, Australia. The tracks are all original and feature other talented Melbourne musicians Gerry Pantazis on drums and James Clark on bass. The Brothers went on to film a live music video for "Where I Want To Be" at the 2004 Deniliquin Ute Muster. This song was renamed "Where I Wanna Be" and rerecorded in 2006 on the Davidson Brothers "Raised on the Road" album.
Raised on the Road (2006)
This is the first album the Davidson Brothers recorded overseas. It was produced by Mark Thornton (Jerry Reed band) in Nashville, Tennessee. Musicians appearing on the album are Bryan Sutton (guitar), Randy Kohrs (dobro) and Dennis Crouch (bass). There is also a guest vocal by Travis List of South Australia.
Davidson Brothers (2007)
The Davidson Brothers recorded this self-titled album in Madison, Tennessee, in September 2007. This was the second album produced by Mark Thornton. This album has lots of variety, from traditional bluegrass to country to intense gypsy swing. Guest musicians appearing on the album are Bryan Sutton (guitar), Rob Ickes (dobro), Dennis Crouch (bass), and a guest vocal by one of the pioneers of Australian bluegrass, Trev Warner, as well as vocal harmonies from Larry Marrs and Cia Cherryholmes. Left Hand Drive won the 2009 Golden Guitar (Country Music Awards of Australia) for Best Instrumental.
Born To Play (2009)
The third album to be produced by Mark Thornton, Born To Play was again recorded in Madison, Tennessee. However, this time around, Hamish and Lachlan set out to showcase their ability to slip comfortably in and out of different musical genres, including bluegrass, country, gypsy, swing and Celtic music. Guest musicians appearing on the album are Bryan Sutton, Randy Kohrs, Kevin Grant, Kenny Malone, The Cherryholmes family, Pat Bergeson, Jeff Taylor, Larry Marrs and Jerry Salley.
Here To Stay (2011)

New Circadia (adventures in mental spelunking) was an installation at the University of Toronto's John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design. The installation, which opened on November 7, 2019 and ran through April 2020, was the first exhibition to take place at the Faculty's Architecture and Design Gallery, located in the lower level of 1 Spadina Crescent. While on display the installation was free and open to the public six days a week. The title New Circadia is a play on the Latin word for daily cycle.
Background
Curated by Daniels Faculty Dean Richard M. Sommer as well as Natalie Fizer and Emily Stephenson from the New York based studio Pillow Culture, the intent of the installation was to create a space designed specifically for visitors to disconnect from technology, and re-connect with their circadian rhythm. Inspired by Nathaniel Kleitman's 1938 Mammoth Cave Experiment which investigated sleep and wakefulness, it presented an immersive, cave-like environment. In addition to the physical installation, the Architecture and Design Gallery hosted a series of free public programs related to the installation including performances, talks, and film screenings.
Details
The installation began on the main floor where didactic texts described different cycles of time and the nature of sleep. There were three additional zones in the lower level: the Transitory zone, the Dark zone, and Oneroi. The Transitory zone was a 72-ft long hallway where visitors had to take off their shoes and store their belongings before entering the cave. This zone was lit from above by artificial skylights created by lighting designer Conor Sampson. Here visitors could make use of "spelunking gear" - unusually shaped red, yellow, and purple pillows designed by Natalie Fizer and Emily Stevenson from Pillow Culture. Passing through a felt curtain, the main cave/Dark zone was scattered with large felted loungers meant to evoke rock-like formations. The area was dimly lit and covered in over 6,000 yards of felt meant to dampen sound. The loungers included built-in speakers that emitted soft humming and wave-like noises created by an assistant professor at the Daniels Faculty, Mitchell Akiyama. The third zone, Oneroi, was created by U of T Daniels Assistant Professor Petros Babasikas and artist Chrissou Voulgari. Oneroi consisted of more secluded, curtained areas in the upper mezzanine of the cave where visitors could either create an audio recording of their dreams or listen to previously recorded dreams of others.

Jack Kirkbride (31 March 1923 – 1 October 2006) was an English cartoonist, and father to Anne Kirkbride, the actor who played Deirdre Barlow in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street from 1972 to 2014.
Kirkbride left school at the age of 14 to become an apprentice painter and decorator but was called up for the Army at age 18, when they began to draw cartoons. They served from 1942 as a transport driver with the Royal Army Service Corps. They fought in the Normandy Campaign in 1944 and was demobbed in 1946. They sold their first cartoon to a national paper in 1953 (a Mothers' Day gag for the Sunday Dispatch), and has since sold to most national papers and magazines, including Punch and The Oldie. Their work also appears in the German press under the name of Jacki.
They became the Oldham Evening Chronicle's regular cartoonist in 1958 and went full-time in the 1970s.
They were a founder member of the Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain and their work was published across Europe.
Kirkbride won first prize at the Waddington's International Cartoon Festival (Margate 1989). Their hobbies included listening to classical music, renovating their 18th century farmhouse on the edge of Saddleworth Moor and playing the pianola.
They died of an aneurysm at their home in Oldham, at the age of 83.

SPT0418-47 is a young and extremely distant galaxy, discovered in 2020, that is surprisingly similar to the Milky Way. We see it as it was when the universe was only 1.4 billion years old. It is surprisingly non-chaotic and contradicts the theory that all galaxies in the early Universe were turbulent and unstable. It is located at a distance of about twelve billion light years from the Earth's home galaxy, the Milky Way. The circular image (on the left of the accompanying picture) is our distorted view of the galaxy; the distortion is due to the gravity of a galaxy (between the Earth and the galaxy SPT0418-47 and not visible in this image) which focuses the light from SPT0418-47 into a ring. Computer modelling can be used to undo the distortion, revealing the galaxy's true appearance: a rotating disk with central bulge (on the right of the accompanying picture).

Botanichnyi Sad (, ) is a station on Kharkiv Metro's Oleksiivska Line. The station is one of two new stations added to the metro system on 21 August 2004, the other one being 23 Serpnia.
The station is located under the Nauky avenue (formerly the Lenin avenue) in the northern part of Kharkiv's city center. The station's name and architectural design recalls the surrounding botanical garden of the Kharkiv University.
History
Plans for the construction of the Botanichniy Sad metro station were first drawn out in the mid-90s. At first, dates for the station's opening were set at 1995, then 1996, and later in 1997. However, due to the difficult financial situation, the station was not built, and construction on the station only began in August 2004, during the celebration of the 350-years of Kharkiv.
Construction
Like the nearby Naukova station, Botanichniy Sad was built with the open construction method, where earth is dug up, the station is constructed, and then covered up again. Initially, the station was supposed to be an above ground station, with a metro bridge crossing the Sarzhyn Yar, a popular recreation place for residents of Kharkiv. The top level of bridge was to hold the Lenin Prospect and the bottom — the station and railway tracks itself. However, the plan was scrapped because the plant environment surrounding the bridge could be destroyed.
Architecture and design
Botanichniy Sad lies shallow underground and consists of a central platform with round columns supporting the ceiling. The station's walls have been covered with green and blue tiles, with reliefs depicting greenery and plants. The columns are covered with light green mosaic tiles with white marble tiles near the bottom. The station's floor is paved with gray-coloured slabs of polished granite.
Two underground ticket vestibules serve the station, located on either side of the station. The northern vestibule has four exits which lead passengers to the intersection of the Lenin Prospect and Otakara Yarosha Street. The southern vestibule's exit leads directly into the botanical park.

Asemospiza is a genus of South American birds in the tanager family Thraupidae.
Taxonomy and species list
These species were formerly placed in the genus Tiaris. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that Tiaris was polyphyletic. In the resulting reorganization to create monophyletic genera, these two species were assigned to a new genus Asemospiza with the sooty grassquit as the type species. The name combines the Ancient Greek ἄσημος/asēmos meaning "without marks" with σπίζα/spiza meaning "finch". These two species are in the subfamily Coerebinae and form a sister clade to the Darwin's finches.
The species in the genus are:

Political career
Early diplomatic career
After passing the Philippine Foreign Service Officer (FSO) Examination, Ramos-Shahani held various high positions such as Ambassador to Australia from August 1978 to December 1980; UN Assistant Secretary-General for Social and Humanitarian Affairs from 1981 to 1986; and Secretary-General of the World Conference on the UN Decade of Women in Nairobi, Kenya in 1985. As Ambassador, they travelled extensively around Australia and was the first Philippine envoy to Australia to visit the Northern Territory. Under their watch, the Australian-Philippines Friendship Society was formally organized in December 1980. They also saw the first formal consultations between the Philippines and Australia in Canberra in 1979 and again in 1980. They advocated for the establishment of a chair in Philippine studies in a top university in Australia.
People Power Revolution
Ramos-Shahani eventually spoke up against the Marcos dictatorship, speaking in support of opposition candidate Corazon Aquino. They then resigned from their UN post and returned to the Philippines, whereupon they tried to convince their brother, Philippine Constabulary Director General Fidel V. Ramos, to support the opposition.

Kangpat is a generic reference to two villages, Kangpat Khullen and Kangpat Khunou located south of Ukhrul in Ukhrul district, Manipur state, India. The village falls under Kamjong sub division. The two villages are connected by Ukhrul-Kamjong state highway. Kangpat is flanked by Sorbung and Punge in the west, Choro in the south, Skipe in the east and Nambisha in the north. Locally, the inhabitants speak Kangpat dialect that belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family. Some researchers are of the view that the dialect spoken by the inhabitants has some affinity to that of the Koireng tribe.
Total population
According to 2011 census, Kangpat Khunou has 58 households with the total of 353 people of which 176 are male and 177 are female. Of the total population, 50 were in the age group of 0–6 years. The average sex ratio of the village is 1006 female to 1000 male which is higher than the state average 985. The literacy rate of the village stands at 61.72% which is lower than the state average 76.94%. Male literacy rate stands at 63.23% while female literacy rate was 57.24%.
According to 2011 census, Kangpat Khullen has 78 households with the total of 438 people of which 230 are male and 208 are female. Of the total population, 59 were in the age group of 0–6 years. The average sex ratio of the village is 904 female to 1000 male which is lower than the state average 985. The literacy rate of the village stands at 93.93% which is higher than the state average 76.94%. Male literacy rate stands at 95.45% while female literacy rate was 92.27%.
People and occupation
The village is home to people of Tangkhul Naga tribe. Majority of the inhabitants are Christians. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the inhabitants. Being a remote area, the village is often in the news for the poor transport system due to bad road condition and the inhabitants suffer most during the rainy season because of frequent landslides. Kangpat is close to the porous Indo-Myanmar international border and the village is often used as transit route by militants for which there are frequent encounters between the Indian arm force and militant groups. There had been many incidents of incursion of land by the Myanmar army and Kangpat is one of the villages that has lost some of its original land due to illegal encroachment by the neighboring country.

On Thursday, July 23, 2009, Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox pitched a perfect game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The game took place at US Cellular Field in Chicago in front of 28,036 fans, and occurred from 1:07 PM CT to 3:10 PM CT.
It was the 18th perfect game and 263rd no-hitter in MLB history, second perfect game and 17th no-hitter in White Sox history. The previous perfect game in MLB history was on May 18, 2004 when Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks pitched a perfect game against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field. The previous occasion a White Sox pitcher threw a perfect game was on April 30, 1922 when Charlie Robertson pitched a perfecto against the Detroit Tigers at Navin Field (later known as Tiger Stadium); that was the fifth perfect game in MLB history.
Buehrle also logged their second career no-hitter; the first was against the Texas Rangers on April 18, 2007. They became the first pitcher to throw multiple no-hitters since Johnson. Buehrle did this in the midst of setting a Major League record by retiring 45 consecutive batters over three games.
The umpire, Eric Cooper, who stood behind the plate for this perfect game was the same home plate umpire when Buehrle threw their first career no-hitter. Ramón Castro was the catcher. Cooper and Buerhle also shared the same uniform number of 56 and White Sox scoring line was 5-6-0 (five runs on six hits with no errors)
At the time, the Rays were tied for the second-highest on-base percentage (.343) of any team, so they were one of the least likely to allow a perfect game. Buehrle's perfect game was to become the first of three perfect games and the first of four no-hitters allowed by the Rays in less than three years:
the second was delivered by Dallas Braden of the Oakland Athletics on May 9, 2010 (Mother's Day)
the third was pitched by Edwin Jackson of the Arizona Diamondbacks on June 25, 2010
and the fourth, which meant the Rays tied the Dodgers as the only MLB franchise to allow three perfect games, being delivered by Félix Hernández on August 15, 2012.
Background
1998 Draft and Major League debut
Mark Buehrle was a 38th round pick and 1139th overall in 1998 draft pick by the White Sox. Buehrle made their major league debut on July 16, 2000, pitching one inning of relief while allowing a run to Milwaukee Brewers. Then they made their first starting appearance on July 19, pitching seven innings while allowing six hits and two runs to Minnesota Twins.
First career no-hitter
On April 18, 2007 against the Texas Rangers at U.S. Cellular Field, Mark Buehrle threw their first career no-hitter. In that game, they threw 106 pitches and faced 27 batters while allowing just one walk. After allowing a walk to Sammy Sosa in the fifth inning and one out after a 3–1 pitch, and they were promptly picked off from first base while facing the next batter.
This was the 16th no-hitter in White Sox history, the first one since August 11, 1991 when Wilson Álvarez threw one at Memorial Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles and first at home since September 10, 1967 when Joel Horlen threw one against the Detroit Tigers.
2009 campaign
Mark Buehrle was the 2009 Opening Day starter, which they took the victory as the Sox beat the Royals 4–2. Buehrle won five straight decisions to start the 2009 season. Their record stood at 9–3 before the All-Star break, and they were voted to the All-Star Game in Busch Stadium in St. Louis near their hometown, where they pitched a perfect third. On June 14, they hit the first and only home run of their career in a road game against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. After completing their perfect game, Buehrle had an 11–3 pitching record with a 3.28 ERA. Buehrle struggled in the games following the perfect game and they did not achieve another win until September 7 against the Red Sox. On September 30 in the second game of the doubleheader, Buehrle pitched their final game of the season at Cleveland and they took the victory when the Sox shutout Cleveland 1–0. After their perfecto till the end of their 2009 campaign, they posted a 2–7 record with a 4.78 ERA and they finished the season 13–10 with a 3.84 ERA. They became the only active player to pitch for least two hundred innings for nine consecutive seasons after their debut in 2000.
2010 Opening Day and play of the season
Buehrle was named the 2010 Opening Day starter for a franchise-record eighth time. In that game, they pitched seven innings and allowed no earned runs. Incredibly, in the fifth inning, they made a spectacular play facing Lou Marson of the Cleveland Indians. Marson hit a ball which bounced off Buehrle's foot, and they managed to pick it up with their glove and immediately throw it backwards between their legs without looking back and 1st baseman Paul Konerko caught the ball with their bare hand for the second out of the inning. This is the #1 play of the season as no other plays beat Buehrle for the remaining six months of the 2010 regular season. In the show Baseball Tonight, the "Buehrle-Meter" is used to estimate the performance of the #1 Web Gems from 1–10 where 10 is just as spectacular as Mark Buehrle's spectacular play on April 5, 2010.
Game
In the bottom of the second inning with two outs and a 3–1 pitch, Josh Fields hit a grand slam off of Scott Kazmir, giving the White Sox a 4–0 lead. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Scott Podsednik hit a lead-off double. The next batter, Alexei Ramírez, scored Podsednik from second with a double of their own, making it a 5–0 White Sox lead.
Two of the Rays batters hit a foul ball very close to the fair territory down the left field line. Five of the Rays hitters had full (3–2) counts.
Ninth inning
In the top of the ninth inning, the Rays' leadoff hitter, Gabe Kapler, hit a deep fly ball to left field-center field, where DeWayne Wise made a spectacular catch, taking a home run away from Kapler and saving the perfect game for Buehrle. Wise was a defensive replacement prior to the ninth inning. The next batter, Michel Hernández, struck out swinging on a two-seam fastball with a full (3–2) count. The final batter, Jason Bartlett, hit a ground ball to shortstop Alexei Ramírez, who threw it to first baseman Josh Fields (Paul Konerko was the designated hitter for the day) to finish off the history-making moment at 3:10 PM CT.

Broadcaster's reactions
As Buehrle exited the field after the eighth inning, White Sox broadcaster Ken Harrelson, calling the game on Comcast SportsNet Chicago, exclaimed "Call your sons! Call your daughters! Call your friends! Call your neighbors! Mark Buehrle has a perfect game going into the ninth!"
Upon watching the replay of Wise's catch, Harrelson declared it was "under the circumstances, one of the greatest catches I have ever seen in 50 years in this game."
As the final ground ball of the game rolled towards White Sox shortstop Alexei Ramírez, Harrelson called out: "Alexei?!" As Ramirez completed the throw to first baseman Josh Fields, Harrelson shouted, "Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! History!"
Though many did not like Harrelson's verbosity and obvious hometown boosterism at the concluding moment of the game, others felt the outburst of emotion captured exactly what they were feeling as the perfect game was sealed.
Aftermath
With the final out, the White Sox players ran onto the field, hugging each other. President Barack Obama, an ardent White Sox supporter, called Buehrle to congratulate them on their perfect game. Then their wife Jamie and their baby daughter Brooklyn came to the U.S. Cellular Field from their home in suburban Chicago to congratulate Mark. Buehrle's reaction was putting their glove on their head in shock before receiving hugs from their teammates.
On July 29, 2009, Mark threw perfect innings. By retiring former teammate Joe Crede, Buehrle set the new record for consecutive batters retired, beating Jim Barr (who had retired 41 consecutive batters over the course of two complete-game wins in 1971, from the third inning of one to the seventh inning of the next) and teammate Bobby Jenks (who had tied Barr's mark over 14 relief appearances in 2007). Buehrle would then go on to retire the next three batters, before walking Minnesota Twin Alexi Casilla with two outs in the sixth inning, thus foiling Buehrle's chance of becoming the first pitcher to ever throw a second career perfect game – let alone consecutive perfect games. Denard Span followed Casilla with a single, thus foiling Buehrle's chance of becoming the second pitcher to throw consecutive no-hitters (the first having been Johnny Vander Meer for the 1938 Reds); in fact, Buehrle allowed 5 runs in innings and took the loss on July 29. Combined with the last out of one appearance, their perfect game, and the 5 2/3 innings worth of perfection, Mark set the new record of 45 consecutive batters retired. This mark was broken by Yusmeiro Petit with 46 over eight appearances in 2014.
On July 29, 2009 Illinois Governor Pat Quinn declared July 30 "Mark Buehrle Day". On August 4 before the game against the Los Angeles Angels, the White Sox held a special ceremony and provided "perfect game" and "MLB Record-Setting" giveaways for fans attending the Sox-Angels series. This series against the Angels was called "The Buehrle Appreciation Series".
The left-center field wall where Wise made their ninth-inning home run-robbing catch is marked with the text, "The Catch".

Victor Dmitrievich Zotov (16 September 1908 – 26 May 1977) was a New Zealand botanist.
Zotov was born in Vladivostok, Russian Empire and in 1924, together with their parents, immigrated to New Zealand, after the Russian Revolution. They attended Feilding Agricultural High School from 1925 to 1927, where they were taught by H.H.Allan, with whom they went to work in 1928 (having written their first scientific paper) at the Plant Research Station in Palmerston North. In 1936 this became the Plant Research Bureau within the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and they continued working in the Botany Division of this organisation until their retirement in 1968.
Zotov's primary research interest was in New Zealand grasses, writing papers on canary grasses, Arundinoideae and especially Gramineae. They were also interested in the vegetation of the Tararua Ranges where they enjoyed tramping, and additionally published on soil erosion.

The Elektron SidStation is a musical synthesizer sound module, built around the MOS Technology SID mixed-mode synthesizer chip originally used in the Commodore 64 home computer. It was produced by the Swedish synthesizer company Elektron, and was introduced in 1999. As the SID chip had not been manufactured for years, Elektron allegedly bought up nearly all the remaining stock.
The company built the SidStation until 2003, when their initial supply of SID chips ran out. The last 100 units sold, the Final 100 Edition, were lasered etched with a number on the front panel's bottom-left corner and sold in descending order from 100 to 1. In March 2005, Elektron claimed to have encountered an additional supply of 100 SID chips and produced 100 SidStation units, selling them for € 920, USD $950, or SEK 8200 each.
In late 2006, Elektron claimed that "100 became 200", and the prices were raised once again. This marks the third time that an additional 100 chips were being produced, each time claiming to be the "final run". This (and the fact that some aftermarket clones of original SID chips exist) has raised skepticism as to how scarce the supply actually is, and which run is actually the final run. However, since January 18, 2007 no new SidStations have been shipped.
As SidStations are manufactured, the company keeps the price in relation to the demand, meaning that the initial SidStations were fairly cheap and later on, when the device was more sought-after, the price increased.
The appearance of the SidStation is retro and features a small LCD-display where the sound editing is done, four assignable knobs, a keypad and a controller wheel.
Different models of SidStations
Besides the standard grey model of SidStation, two other models exist. The beta models of SidStations used by Elektron and their beta testers had a shining red color. Around twelve red units were made and approximately half of them were sold to early customers and beta-test partners. Some of these partners sold their units at a later time giving a handful of metallic red SidStations being owned by private people. Besides the color, these beta machines had a slightly more aggressive character due to some voltages running higher in the filter section, as well as certain beta-testing modes and the ability to upgrade the firmware to a greater extent.
Elektron also sold fifty black SidStation units, which had black aluminum casing and blue LEDs, contrary to the original green ones, called the Ninja Edition. This model also came with a different set of sound patches. There is also a blue SidStation that was made as a one off, by Elektron, for a walk in customer that just happened to see the blue shell sitting unused on the shelf .
Sound of the SidStation
The sound of SidStation is, of course, very similar to that of the original Commodore 64. The SID chip is well known for being noisy. By design, the oscillators never stop outputting signal—even while not in use. It's this flaw, however, that is part of the character and sound of the SID chip.
Most SidStations contain the 6581 R4AR incarnation of the SID chip. This version is considered the best trade-off between sound, stability and conformity (which is a big deal concerning the SID chip, since they tend to sound different from unit to unit).
The SidStation is capable of producing all the waveforms of the C64, Triangle, Saw, Pulse, Mix (which is a mix between Saw and Pulse) and variable Noise. Besides this is the synth, a 4-part LFO-modulation system which can be used with Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass and various combinations of these filters (including a Notchfilter). All of these are controllable by the four knobs on top of the SidStation.

Saving Zoë is a 2007 fiction book written by Alyson Noël. The book's plot follows a fifteen-year-old girl named Echo who is coping with the murder of their older sister, Zoe. Everything changes when Zoe's boyfriend shows Zoe's diary to Echo. The book was adapted into a film in 2019.
Reception
Amy Alessio of Teenreads wrote, "Zoe's diary will reach the emotions of readers of Alyson Noel's moving and compelling novel while bringing peace and understanding to Echo." Books With Bite wrote, "Beautifully written and strongly proposed, this book will grab you at your heart." Zoë Byrne of Seven Ponds wrote, "In Saving Zoë, Noël poignantly blends twinkles of humor from more typical teen trysts, such as navigating through all of the confusing moments with first experiences of love and dealing with difficult parents, to heart-wrenching moments where an overwhelming amount grief, loneliness and sadness consume Echo's daily functioning in the days right before and months right after the first year anniversary of Zoë's death."
Film adaptation
In 2019 the book was adapted into a film of the same name; starring Laura and Vanessa Marano.

The Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) is a central recruitment agency under the ownership of Ministry of Finance, Government of India that was started with an aim to encourage the recruitment and placement of young undergraduates, postgraduates and doctorates at the rank of Group 'A' officer, Group 'B' officer, Group 'C' employee and Group 'D' employee in nationalised banks and regional rural banks in India. It also provides standardised systems for assessment and result processing services to organisations.
History
After nationalisation of banks in India in 1969, Indian banks needed to expand their branch network across the country so that they were more accessible to their customers. This required more staff but recruitment through methods such as advertising were unsatisfactory. Thus, the banks asked the National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM) to design a selection testing process through which they could hire proficient candidates. And as a result, a small unit named Personnel Selection Services (PSS) was established to handle these types of projects. A few years later, in 1984, PSS was converted into IBPS.
IBPS currently functions as an autonomous body that is mainly engaged in conducting competitive exams for recruitment to clerical and officers' posts in the banking sector.
Earlier, candidates had to write multiple exams conducted by each bank for their vacancies. But from 2012, the Recruitment process has been changed. Now IBPS conducts four different recruitment processes namely CRP PO/MT, CRP RRBs, CRP Clerical, CRP Specialist Officers under which various exams take place every year for banking sector recruitment. The exams conducted by IBPS are as follows:
IBPS PO/MT exam takes place for the recruitment of Probationary Officers and Management Trainees' in the participating banks, which are national public sector banks.
IBPS SO exam takes place for the recruitment of Specialist Officers, which are Scale-I officers in the national public sector banks.
IBPS Clerk exam takes place for the recruitment of clerks in the national public sector banks.
IBPS RRB Officer Scale-I exam takes place for the recruitment of Scale-I Officers in Regional Rural Banks, this post is equivalent to Probationary Officers post in National Public Sector Banks.
IBPS RRB Office Assistant exam takes place for the recruitment of Office Assistant in Regional Rural Banks, this post is equivalent to Clerk post in National Public Sector Banks.
IBPS RRB Officer Scale-II and Scale-III exam takes place for the recruitment of Scale-II and Scale-III Officers in Regional Rural Banks, the post of Officer Scale-II is equivalent to Specialist Officer post and Officer Scale-III post is equivalent to Senior Manager in National Public Sector Banks.
Governance
IBPS is governed by a board that includes nominees from government organisations such as the Reserve Bank of India, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai, Indian Institute of Banking and Finance, National Institute of Bank Management, Indian Banks' Association and the government owned banks.
Services
IBPS offers its services to banks in the government and private sectors, regional rural banks, and foreign banks. It also serves other financial institutions, including co-operative banks, insurance companies, academic institutions, and both private- and state-owned companies.
The services are:
Project consultation: assistance in conducting examinations for recruitment and promotion
Assessment centres that help organisations in identifying the knowledge and skills of applicants for the suitable positions
Personality assessments using group exercises and interviews to identify the candidates' higher cognitive skills
Training programmes for senior staff to help develop their observational and interviewing skills
Workshops for people who design their own question papers
Lists of experts who can conduct interviews or group exercises effectively

Madison County is a county located in the central part of the U.S. state of Kentucky. At the 2020 census, its population was 92,701. Its county seat is Richmond. The county is named for Virginia statesman James Madison, who later became the fourth President of the United States.
The county is part of the Richmond-Berea, KY Micropolitan Statistical Area which is also included in the Lexington–Fayette–Richmond–Frankfort, KY Combined Statistical Area.
Madison County is considered a moist county, meaning that although the county prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages (and is thus a dry county), it contains a city where retail alcohol sales are allowed. Nevertheless, two of the county's 19 precincts are completely dry. Alcohol can also be sold by the drink in Berea, Richmond, and at Arlington and The Bull golf clubs.
Madison County is home to Eastern Kentucky University, Berea College, and historic Boone Tavern. Famous pioneer Daniel Boone lived in Madison County and built Fort Boonesborough, now a state historic site.
History
Indian trader John Findley, Daniel Boone, and four others first came into the area that is now Madison County in 1769 on a hunting and exploring expedition. In 1774, the Transylvania Company, led by Judge Richard Henderson of North Carolina, purchased of land west of the Appalachians (including present-day Madison County) from the Cherokee Nation. Daniel Boone was hired to cut a trail through the Cumberland Gap and establish a settlement on the Kentucky River. The settlement at Fort Boonesborough began in April 1775.
In 1785, Madison County was established from a portion of Lincoln County, Virginia.
Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.3%) is water.

Demographics
As of the census of 2000, there were 70,872 people, 27,152 households, and 18,218 families residing in the county. The population density was .

Olympiodoros () was a military leader (General) of ancient Greece. Their capacity as a savior of Athens and their self-confident power and serious engagement during political crises were emphasized. They were elected Strategos. They took part in the established Athenian coalition government with Philippides of Paiania. They commanded a body of three hundred picked men at the Battle of Plataea, who were engaged in a service from which all the other Greeks shrank. They were an Athenian general who, when Athens was attacked by Cassander, compelled the latter to withdraw their forces. They subsequently rid the city of Macedonian garrison which Demetrius had stationed there, and successfully defended Athens against Demetrius himself.

New Sudan is a concept for restructuring the Sudanese state, which was proposed by the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement during the Second Sudanese Civil War. The original SPLA/M Manifesto outlined 'New Sudan' as a proposed united and secular Sudanese state. The vision of 'New Sudan' was developed by Dr. John Garang, who advocated the 'New Sudan' as a democratic and pluralistic state.
The 1994 National Convention of New Sudan (organized by SPLA/M) redefined 'New Sudan' as a system of governance for the regions under SPLA/M control. After John Garang's death in 2005 and the independence of South Sudan in 2011, the New Sudan discourse became a less prominent feature in Sudanese politics.

Thomas Dodd (1771–1850) was an English auctioneer and printseller.
Early life
The son of Thomas Dodd, a tailor, they were born in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields, London, on 7 July 1771. When they were ten years old their father left home, and they were taken from school at Shooter's Hill. Their first employment was in the service of an Anglo-American colonel named De Vaux, an eccentric adventurer: they were taken about the country as a member of their band of juvenile musicians. After a time the colonel left them with a butcher; they ran away in quest of the colonel, going penniless on foot from London to Liverpool, and from there to Matlock Bath.
At another time Dodd was left with an itinerant harper at Conway. Harsh treatment induced them to seek the protection of a Welsh innkeeper; then they lived a while with a sporting parson, ultimately returning to London in 1788, and taking a menial position in the shop of their uncle, a tailor named Tooley, in Bucklersbury. Their next place was as a footman. In 1794 they married their employer's waiting-maid, and opened a day-school near Battle Bridge, St. Pancras. They gave up their school to accept a situation as engrossing clerk in the enrolment office of the court of chancery.
Printseller
In 1796 Dodd took a small shop in Lambeth Marsh for the sale of old books and prints. Two years later they moved to Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. Their dealings in prints gradually extended, and their stock assumed large proportions. In 1806 they opened an auctionroom in St Martin's Lane, and there they sold some famous collections, among them being that of General Dowdeswell in January 1809. In the course of their business they had large sales of prints and books at Liverpool, Portsmouth, and elsewhere. When they were at Ludlow in 1812, they found in the possession of an innkeeper a copy of Henry Holland's Basioloogia (1618), but it was not till seven years later that they were able to buy it.
Good fortune deserted them and their stock dwindled. They settled in Manchester about 1819 as an auctioneer, and in 1823 projected a scheme which led to the establishment of the Royal Manchester Institution in Mosley Street, and the holding of annual exhibitions of pictures.
Returning to London they had a sale-room for two years in Leicester Street, Leicester Square, and then became for several years supervisor for Martin Colnaghi; from whose establishment they were engaged by the Earl of Yarborough to arrange and complete their collection of prints. In 1844, a widower, they were elected a brother of the Charterhouse.
Dodd died on 17 August 1850 at the residence of Joseph Mayer near Liverpool. They were buried in St James Cemetery, Liverpool.
Works
Dodd acquired a wide knowledge of engravings, and began an elaborate biographical catalogue of engravers, which eventually formed thirty folio volumes of manuscript.
In 1817 Dodd spent time on a dictionary of monograms, but a similar work by Brulliot was published about that time. Before leaving Manchester at the end of 1825 they began to publish their work entitled The Connoisseur's Repertorium; or a Universal Historical Record of Painters, Engravers, Sculptors, and Architects, and of their Works, &c. The first two volumes were published in 1825, and the work was continued to the name "Barraducio" in a sixth volume, issued in 1831, when lack of support compelled the author to abandon it.
In 1839–41 Dodd made a catalogue, which remained in manuscript, of the Douce collection of fifty thousand prints in the Bodleian Library. They also arranged and catalogued Horace Walpole's prints, which were sold by George Henry Robins for £3,840.
To Joseph Mayer they bequeathed their manuscript compilations and other collections, extending to about two hundred folios, and including their Account of Engravers.

Senator O'Connor College School (also called SOCS, Senator O'Connor CS, Senator O'Connor, OCS, or simply Senator or O'Connor), previously known as John J. Lynch High School until 1967 is a Separate high school in the Parkwoods neighbourhood in the North York district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada serving grades 9 to 12 in the communities of Wexford, Maryvale, Don Mills, and Dorset Park.
The school was named after Senator Frank O'Connor, founder of the Laura Secord chocolate company. The school is part of the Toronto Catholic District School Board and was originally founded as John J. Lynch High School in 1963, named after the first archbishop of Toronto from 1870 to 1888, John Joseph Lynch. It had 1,414 students , and was ranked 266 of 738 secondary schools in the 2017-18 Fraser Institute School Report Card.
History
The story
Frank Patrick O'Connor was a Canadian politician, business person, philanthropist. They were the founder of Laura Secord Chocolates and Fanny Farmer, and the namesake behind O'Connor Drive in Toronto.  They are the son of Mary Eleanor McKeown and Patrick O'Connor, O'Connor quit school at the age of 14 and started working at Canadian General Electric in Peterborough. They married Mary Ellen Hayes and moved with them to Toronto in 1912. They opened the Laura Secord Candy Store on Yonge Street in 1913 as they expanded the store across Canada and into the United States where it was known as Fanny Farmer Candy Stores.
As a Roman Catholic, they gave $500,000 in the 1930s to the Archdiocese of Toronto under the trusteeship of Cardinal James Charles McGuigan. O'Connor was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1935 by Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. They represented the senatorial division of Scarborough Junction, Ontario until their death in 1939. O'Connor survived their wife, who died in 1931, and died at this estate at age 54.
The school history
Prior to the founding of Senator O'Connor College School, several high schools were established around that area after the openings of Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute in Scarborough (1954), Don Mills Collegiate Institute (1957) and nearby Victoria Park Collegiate Institute (1960). In the meantime, several catholic separate schools within the Metropolitan Separate School Board (MSSB, renamed later to the Toronto Catholic District School Board) were opened such as Precious Blood Separate School in 1953 and Annunciation Separate School in 1965.
Senator O'Connor College School was founded by the Brothers of the Christian Schools and the Daughters of Wisdom in 1963 as John J. Lynch High School, becoming the first co-educational Catholic school in the Toronto archdiocese. However, boys were taught by Christian Brothers and girls were taught on a different floor by nuns with the Daughters of Wisdom. In 1965, the second school building designed in an hexagon by Fisher Tedman Architects was erected, given the name Senator O'Connor College School with Brother Denis F.S.C. as its inaugurating principal. Starting in the 1967–68 school year, the "Senator O'Connor" name became the name for the whole school combining the Lynch and O'Connor buildings while the ninth and tenth grades were placed by the MSSB while grades 11–13 continued to be taught by their religious orders. The high school was built on land given to them by Senator Frank Patrick O'Connor, a Catholic philanthropist and founder of Laura Secord Chocolates, a Canadian chocolatier and ice cream company.
Senator O'Connor's House and Garage, and another building, belonging to the Christian Brothers, still exist on campus, and the Christian Brothers still lived there as a Provincial Office up until 2002.
In the 1970s, the Christian Brothers were an active part of school life, teaching classes, holding positions in the school administration and assisting with cafeteria monitoring. The administration of the school was turned over to lay teachers in 1973.
The school used to be split up into three main structures: the main O'Connor building, the JJ Lynch building, and a later addition of a complex of portables under one roof called the "Taj" or the "Taj Mahal". There was also another area with over a half dozen portables. There used to be an indoor swimming pool connected to the house, but it was torn down sometime in the late 1980s or early 90s. The Christian Brothers' house was located in the center of the campus, and so students would pass right in front of it or around it on all sides daily.
The Christian Brothers' house has been marked as a historic site by the City of Toronto and is protected as such.
In 1984, when the Province of Ontario decided that Catholic secondary schools were to be fully funded, the school became publicly funded by 1987, and Senator O'Connor ceased being a private school. The school is fully operated by the MSSB. The last of the Christian Brothers staff to teach at O'Connor retired at the end of June 1990.
Originally the main high school was built to hold 732 students and by the 1990s the student population almost doubled that figure. Additions to the school such as the "Taj" were made over the course of the school's history. By 1995, talks of building a new school on the property began. That project was protested by local residents until its approval sometime in the early 2000s. In 2002, the Toronto Catholic District School Board acquired the O'Connor House from the Christian Brothers. The old Lynch, O'Connor and Taj Mahal buildings were demolished and a large new modern two-storey 1020-pupil high school which opened in September 2005 is now in place.
The former address of the school was 5 Avonwick Gate. The current address of the new Senator O'Connor College School is 60 Rowena Drive. The address change occurred because the entrance to the school was moved to the opposite end of the property that opens onto Rowena Drive. The new building, designed by Kearns Mancini Architects Inc., was partially built where the Lynch building previously stood as well as on the old athletic field.
Senator O'Connor celebrated its 50th anniversary on June 1, 2013, with a mass and the opening ceremonies, including a special presentation to Brother Domenic Viggiani, president of De La Salle College, who accepted plaques on behalf of the school's founding Christian Brothers, some of whom also attended the event. The events included an alumni basketball game, arts presentations, live music, decade rooms, the sale of past yearbooks, food and refreshments in the afternoon and an alumni show, after party in the evening. The guests took a sneak peek of the restoration of the historic O'Connor House, which was severely damaged in a fire a year prior.

Overview
Advanced Placement
The Advanced Placement program continues a tradition of achievement, by providing students with the opportunity for academic enrichment. At Senator O'Connor, a select cohort of students studies at the AP (Enriched) level in Core Courses from the 9th through 12th grades. Students enter this program through an application process undertaken in Grade 8. Students in AP courses study topics in greater depth, enhancing their intellectual development. A flexible program, it can be tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual; students have the opportunity to participate in specific AP subjects in their fields of interest. Students are exposed to university level content and expectations, allowing them to feel more comfortable and have more confidence once they reach the academic setting of university. Writing AP College Board exams at the end of Grade 12 can lead to the acquisition of equivalent credits in participating universities in Canada, the United States and overseas.
Extended/Immersion French
The Extended/Immersion French program is a continuation of the elementary early or middle French Immersion program. Students who have successfully completed a minimum of ten French courses, four in Extended/Immersion French and six in other subjects taught in French (géographie, histoire and religion) will receive an Extended/Immersion French Certificate upon graduation.
O'Connor students are encouraged to take advantage of outside activities, competitions and foreign exchanges. A trip to Quebec provides opportunity to practice their French Language skills.
Arts
Though not officially deemed as an Arts high school, O'Connor offers electives in the arts including Drama, Theatre Production, Visual Arts, Applied Design, Vocal and Instrumental Music, Guitar, Piano, Film, Photography, and Yearbook. The Arts department offers extra-curricular opportunities for students through various stage shows, art shows, plays, and music shows, and arts-based clubs. Some clubs include Anime Club, Mural Club, Synergy Dance Crew (competitive), Synergy Dance Club, Yearbook Club, Art Council, Music Council, Drama Council, Jazz Band, Concert Band, Choir, and Stage Crew. O'Connor is equipped with an auditorium that has approximately 230 seats, with up-to-date sound and lighting capabilities.

Walter Francis "Jack" Crangle (June 8, 1899 – August 31, 1944) was an American football fullback. They played college football for the University of Illinois and was selected as an All-American in 1920 and 1921. They were a member of Illinois' Big Ten Conference championship teams in 1919 and 1920. They played one season of professional football for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League. They were selected as a second-team All-NFL player by Collyers Eye Magazine in 1923. They also played minor league baseball in 1924 for Elgin in the Chicago League. Crangle later became a football and basketball coach at St. Viator College, head baseball coach and assistant football coach under Gwinn Henry at the University of Missouri and assistant football coach at St. Louis University. In their later years, they worked for the Aluminum Company of America and operated a filling station north of Columbia, Missouri. Crangle died at their home in Independence, Missouri at age 45 in 1944. Following Crangle's death in 1944, Jack Ryan of the Chicago Daily News wrote that Crangle "rates high among the many good backs Bob Zuppke developed at the state university." Howard Millard of the Decatur Review wrote: "It doesn't seem possible that Jack Crangle, the big, easy going, likeable fellow, probably the greatest fullback in all Illinois University history, is dead." Crangle was survived by their widow, Marjorie.

The 1963 Buffalo Bills season was the team's fourth season in the American Football League. Winless after their first four games, Buffalo won seven of the final ten games, including the final two over the New York Jets, to finish with their second-consecutive 7–6–1 record, tied with the Boston Patriots atop the Eastern division. In this era, this required a tiebreaker playoff, the AFL's first. The Patriots and Bills had split their season series, each team winning at home, and the Bills were slight favorites as playoff hosts.
The playoff game on December 28 was played on a snowy field at War Memorial Stadium and Boston won 26–8, ending Buffalo's season.

Season summary
The Bills were favored by many to win the AFL's Eastern division before the season, but for the second consecutive season, the Bills had a terrible start to the year, winless in their first four games, with an 0–3–1 record. The Bills rallied to win five of their next six games before going 2–2 in the final four weeks.
Quarterback Jack Kemp was the opening day starter for the first time after an abbreviated 1962 season. By Week Four, however, they were splitting time with rookie Daryle Lamonica. During the middle of the Bills' season (other than two Lamonica starts in Weeks 13 and 14), Kemp established themselves as the team's leader and full-time passer. Kemp was conservative, but effective, with only 5.2% of their passes being intercepted.
Wide receivers Elbert Dubenion (53 catches for 959 yards) and Bill Miller (69 for 860) were Kemp's biggest targets in 1963, with Cookie Gilchrist leading the team with 979 rushing yards, third in the league. Gilchrist's 12 rushing touchdowns led the AFL, as did their 256 total touches. Gilchrist set a then-record for yards in a game, with 243 in a blowout win against the Jets in Week Fourteen.
Halfback Wray Carlton was sidelined for most of the season with an injury, forcing Gilchrist to shoulder most of the load.
Going into the final week of the season, the Bills were 6–5–1, whereas the division-leading Patriots were 7–5–1: a patriot win or a Bills loss would eliminate them. Instead, the Patriots were blown out 35–3 at defending champion Kansas City, and the Bills rallied in the fourth quarter to defeat the Jets in the final sporting event played at the Polo Grounds. The Bills and Patriots, now both 7–6–1, had to play a tiebreaker playoff to determine who would face the Western Division champion Chargers (11–3) in the AFL championship game.
On a freezing day and snowy field in Buffalo, the Bills trailed 16–0 at halftime. Buffalo's only score was a 93-yard pass from Daryle Lamonica to Elbert Dubenion in the third quarter, with a successful two-point conversion to cut the lead in half. The Patriots tacked on another ten unanswered points to win 26–8, and advanced to the AFL championship game against the San Diego Chargers (11–3) of the Western division, who had the week off. (Boston was demolished by San Diego, 51–10).

The Sacandaga River is a river in the northern part of New York in the United States. Its name comes from the Native American Sa-chen-da'-ga, meaning "overflowed lands".
The Sacandaga River is a tributary of the Hudson River, flowing into it at Hadley, at the border of Saratoga County and Warren County.
River course
The Sacandaga River's headwaters north of Great Sacandaga Lake begin in the town of Lake Pleasant. From Lake Pleasant, the river follows a short moving course or path known as the Sacandaga Outlet (under New York Route 8) into Lake Pleasant. The Sacandaga River drains Lake Pleasant at a location next to the public beach in the village of Speculator. The river then follows a winding path through some wetlands and various ecosystems through the county. In Speculator, the Sacandaga River Community Park was built by local volunteers and has a number of boardwalks and pathways that follow the course of the river.
Near the town boundary between Wells and Lake Pleasant, the river flows into a series of ponds. The Sacandaga River course takes a steep path flowing over a series of waterfalls including Christine Falls, Austin Falls and Auger Falls.
The East Branch joins the trunk stream in the town of Wells. After flowing through Wells, the river enters Lake Algonquin, a manmade impoundment constructed in the 1920s to stimulate the community's tourism industry. The East Branch goes through Johnsburg in Warren County and flows parallel to, in part, NY Route 8, passing the communities of Oregon in Johnsburg and Griffin in the town of Wells.
The Sacandaga flows out of Lake Algonquin into a hydro-electric plant and follows a course of rapids to Great Sacandaga Lake through the towns of Hope and Benson. In that area, it connects with Groff Creek. Then it enters the Great Sacandaga Lake in the village of Northville, which it flows through the lake to the Conklingville Dam. Which then it enters the town of Hadley, where it ends at the Hudson River. Downstream of Stewart's Dam in Hadley, recreational releases are held by Brookfield Energy, creating a two-mile Class II whitewater run to the Hudson River for local paddlers.
Hydrology
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains a few stream gauges along Sacandaga River. The one station located upstream from Hope, had a maximum discharge of per second on March 27, 1913, and a minimum discharge of per second on September 30, 1913. Another station located upstream from the mouth in operation since 1907, had a maximum discharge of per second on March 28, 1913, and a minimum discharge of per second on May 4, 1985, March 30–31, and many days in April 1992. Since the construction of Great Sacandaga Lake in 1930, the maximum discharge was on May 2, 2011.

Shadow on the Hearth is a science fiction novel by American writer Judith Merril, originally published in hardcover by Doubleday in 1950. It was their first novel. A British hardcover was published by Sidgwick & Jackson in 1953, with a paperback following from Compact Books in 1966. Italian translations appeared in 1956 and 1992; a German translation was issued in 1982. It was included in Spaced Out: Three Novels of Tomorrow, a 2008 NESFA Press omnibus compiling all Merril's novels (the other two written in collaboration with Cyril M. Kornbluth). No American paperback of Shadow on the Hearth has ever been published, although a book club edition appeared.
Shadow on the Hearth tells the story of "a Westchester woman and their two children after the explosion of a series of atomic bombs on New York". Merril described it as "a very political novel, ... written for political reasons".
Merril began writing Shadow on the Hearth as a short story; "When it reached ten thousand words," they remembered, "I began to understand that it wanted to be a novel." Although they stopped working on the piece when it reached twice that length, needing to spend more time with their young daughter, Doubleday editor Walter I. Bradbury read the incomplete draft and bought the novel. Merril quit their editorial job at Bantam to complete it. When they completed it, Doubleday imposed its own title (avoiding any mention of nuclear war), revising the text to create a happier ending, and wrapping the novel in a nondescript dust jacket. "On the cover was an attractive young mother, obviously in great distress: it could have been a gothic novel", Merril later groused, "or basically anything".
In 1954, the Motorola TV Theatre aired an adaptation of Shadow on the Hearth, retitled Atomic Attack.
Reception
New York Times reviewer Charles Poore described Shadow on the Hearth as "a rather chintzy account of what happened to a Westchester family when the atomic bombs began to burst through the American air", noting that Merril "concentrate[s] on the creation of believable leading characters" and concluding that the novel "is generally entertaining reading, even if . . . not always for the reasons intended by the author". Another Times reviewer, John Cournos, received the novel unfavorably, saying its story "seems more like a somewhat uncomfortable picnic than a manifestation of a catastrophe".
Genre reviewers viewed Merril's effort more favorably. Groff Conklin described Shadow on the Hearth as "a masterly example of sensitive and perceptive story-telling." Boucher and McComas praised it as "a sensitively human novel, terrifying in its small-scale reflection of grand-scale catastrophe." P. Schuyler Miller found it a "warm, human novel" comparable to Earth Abides. Startling Stories declared that "its beautifully rendered interlocking series of incidents and events . . . creates an almost too-vivid picture for the reader of what life in the very near future may become". Kenneth F. Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction that "The emotions you will find here are in places hard and brutal, not softly sentimental". Future Science Fiction. however, dismissed the novel for its "'true confession' level of writing".
More recent reviewers also rate the novel highly. Lisa Yaszek writes that Shadow on the Hearth "is one of the only postwar holocaust narratives that manages to work its way out from under the paralyzing shadow of the mushroom cloud and to imagine the possibility of women -- and men -- working together to build a more peaceful and rational future". Judith Merril: A Critical Study notes that "contemporary critics respect Merril's novel for its originality in domesticating nuclear attack -- hence the story's power and darkness". David Seed reports the novel is "universally praised . . . for its understated method, avoidance of melodrama and unusually oblique description of nuclear attack". M. Keith Booker declares that Shadow on the Hearth is "a relatively daring novel" and "a useful corrective to the heroic vision of post apocalypse life".

The Kawabata evaluation system (KES) is used to measure the mechanical properties of fabrics. The system was developed by a team led by Professor Kawabata in the department of polymer chemistry, Kyoto University Japan.
KES is composed of four different machines on which a total of six tests can be performed:
Tensile & shear tester – tensile, shear
Pure bending tester – pure bending
Compression tester – compression
Surface tester – surface friction and roughness
The evaluation can include measurement of the transient heat transfer properties associated with the sensation of coolness generated when fabrics contact the skin during wear. The KES not only predicts human response but understands the perception of softness.

Bertram Larsen was a leading Danish manufacturer of tower clocks. The firm created a vast number of tower clocks and Carillons for Danish churches, castles and manor houses, town halls, railway stations and other landmark buildings. It was also responsible for the restoration of a significant number of historic clocks, including Lund astronomical clock in Lund Cathedral in 1909–1923.
History
Early history, 1827–1880
The firm was founded in 1827 by Gustav Zettervall in Sorø. They later moved the operations first to Ringsted and then Køge. The firm was from 1847 continued by their foster son Bertram Larsen (1823–1877). After Bertram Larsen's death in 1877, it was continued by their widow Juliane Emilie Thygesen (1820–1901) under the management of their son Julius.
Julius Bertram Larsen, 1880–1935
Julius Bertram Larsen (1854–1935) moved the firm to Copenhagen when their mother ceded the ownership of it in 1880.
Fridtjof Bertram-Larsen, 1935–1970s
The firm was after Julius bertram Larsen's death in 1935 continued by their son, Fridtjof Bertram-Larsen (1891–1980). Their works include the carillons at Odense Cathedral, Ribe Cathedral and Church of Our Saviour. The firm closed in the 1970s.

Sovereignty goddess is a scholarly term, almost exclusively used in Celtic studies (although parallels for the idea have been claimed in other traditions, usually under the label hieros gamos). The term denotes a goddess who, personifying a territory, confers sovereignty upon a king by marrying or having sex with him. Some narratives of this type correspond to folk-tale motif D732, the Loathly Lady, in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index. This trope has been identified as 'one of the most well-known and often studied thematic elements of Celtic myth'. It has also, however, been criticised in recent research for leading to "an attempt to prove that every strong female character in medieval Welsh and Irish tales is a souvenir of a Celtic sovereignty goddess".
Historical evidence
There is some evidence in Greek and Roman accounts of historical Celtic women that leading women such as Camma and Cartimandua might in antiquity actually have been associated with goddesses. It is also clear that medieval Irish rituals inaugurating a new king sometimes took the form of a banais ríghe ('wedding-feast of kingship'), because the king was imagined symbolically to be marrying their dominion, and that similar rituals known by the term feis might involve both sexual activity, and horses (in turn evoking the idea, prominent in modern scholarship, of Celtic horse-goddesses). Most luridly, Giraldus Cambrensis, in their 1188 Topographia Hibernica, claimed that at the inauguration of the king of the Cenél Conaill, the successor to the kingship publicly sexually embraced a white mare. This would then be slaughtered and cooked into a broth in which the king bathed, before they and their people drank it.
However, the type-text for the idea of the sovereignty goddess is the medieval Irish Echtra Mac nEchach ('the adventures of the sons of Eochaid'), in which a hideously ugly woman offers the young men water in return for a kiss. Only Niall kisses them with conviction, and moreover has sex with her, whereupon the woman becomes beautiful and utters the verse
The story is transparently a pseudo-history composed in support of the claim of the Uí Néill dynasty to dominance in Ireland.
Criticism
The fairly strong evidence for a tradition of sovereignty goddesses in early Ireland has led to a fashion in Celtic scholarship for interpreting other female characters as euhemerised sovereignty goddesses, or for arguing that the portrayals of women have been influenced by traditions of sovereignty goddesses.
This way of reading medieval Celtic female characters goes back to the 1920s, and is related to the myth and ritual school of scholarship. For example, the protagonist of the Welsh Canu Heledd is sometimes read in this way, and figures as diverse as Guenevere; the Cailleach Bhéirre;<ref>Jo Radner, 'The Hag of Beare: The Folklore of a Sovereignty Goddess', Tennessee Folklore Society Bulletin, 40 (1970), 75-81.</ref> Medb; Rhiannon; warrior women such as the Morrígan, Macha and Badb; and the loathly lady of Chaucer's Wife of Bath's Tale have been viewed in the same light. Britta Irslinger has argued that female characters in early Irish literature whose names relate to ruling or the supernatural, or who have been named after kingdoms, originate as sovereignty goddesses, whereas those whose names relate to drink or some other benefit of the hall were queens.
However, recent scholarship has tended to criticise these assumptions, in both medieval Irish and related material. For example, the portrayals of Gormflaith ingen Donncadha (d. 861), Gormflaith ingen Flann Sinna (c. 870–948), and Gormflaith ingen Murchada (960–1030) have all been read as showing influence from the idea of the sovereignty goddess, but this has been shown to rest on little evidence. Likewise the role of the Empress of Constantinople, who appears in the Middle Welsh Peredur but not in its French source, has been found to be open to other readings. Even where female characters might historically owe something to traditions of sovereignty goddesses, reading them primarily through this lens has been argued to be limiting and reductive.

James Carr (September 9, 1777 – August 24, 1818), son of U.S. Congressman Francis Carr, was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Maine, then a District of Massachusetts.
Carr was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on September 9, 1777. They attended Phillips Exeter and Byfield Academies, and then went to sea as clerk on the U.S.S. Crescent. They served two years as secretary to the United States Consul at Algiers. They then joined their parents (who had migrated to Bangor, Maine), engaging in mercantile pursuits and serving as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1806–1811) for the District of Maine.
Carr was elected as a Federalist to the Fourteenth United States Congress (1815–1817), the second person from Bangor to occupy that office (following their father).
Carr was drowned in the Ohio River on August 24, 1818. While traveling with their family on a steamboat, their 9-year-old daughter Mary fell overboard just below Louisville, Kentucky, and Carr entered the water in a failed attempt to save them Neither of their bodies were ever recovered, though a memorial to Carr was erected at Bangor's Mount Hope Cemetery.
Carr was married to Betsey Stelle Jarvis, who migrated to Illinois along with two brothers following the tragedy on the river. The Carrs remained a prominent mercantile and political family in Bangor despite James' death (see Francis Carr).

The Sxy 5′ UTR element is an RNA element that controls expression of the sxy gene in H. influenzae. The sxy gene is a transcription factor (also known as TfoX) that regulates competence which is the ability of bacteria to take up DNA from their environment. When the sxy gene is deleted the bacterium loses the ability to express genes in the competence regulon. Cameron et al. recently showed that mutations in the 5′ end of the sxy gene lead to hypercompetance. They showed that this region formed an RNA secondary structure that occludes the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Mutations that interfere with the stability of this secondary structure lead to increased translation of sxy followed by upregulation of the competence regulon.
tfoR RNA
In the fellow gammaproteobacterium Vibrio cholerae, a different RNA regulatory system is used. Here, a sRNA named 'tfoR' positively regulates expression of the sxy (tfoX) protein.
The RNA element responds to chitin, which is an important regulator of competence in V. cholera. Deletion of tfoR removed all competence for exogenous DNA in V. cholera in vivo.

The mountain oriole (Oriolus percivali), is a species of bird in the family Oriolidae. It is found in central and eastern Africa from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to central Kenya and western Tanzania.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
Taxonomy and systematics
The mountain oriole has been considered by some authorities to be a subspecies of the black-headed oriole or the black-winged oriole. Alternate names for the mountain oriole include the black-tailed oriole, montane oriole and Percival's oriole.

Elizabeth Scott Williams Smith (, Scott; after first marriage, Williams; after second marriage, Smith; 1708 – June 13, 1776) was an 18th-century British-born American poet and hymnwriter. Prior to 1750, they wrote many hymns with the largest of their known manuscript collections containing 90 of these. The first publication of their hymns was in The Christian's Magazine, edited by William Dodd, 1763. Nineteen of their hymns were given in John Ash and Caleb Evans' baptist Collection, Bristol, 1769, and twenty in John Dobell's New Selection, 1806. Of these, one of the best known is "All hail, Incarnate God". Smith died in 1776.
Early life
Elizabeth Scott was born at Norwich, England, probably in 1708. Them father was Thomas Scott (1680-1746), an independent, dissenting minister of that city. A brother Thomas, was likewise a hymnwriter, while another brother, Joseph Nicol Scott, was a physician, dissenting minister and writer. Them father's brother, Daniel Scott, was a lexicographer.
Them father wrote of their (1 March 1740) as 'one who devotes themselves to doing good, as a Protestant nun.' Them letter to Doddridge, 10 May 1745, shows that they were suffering from religious depression, not unconnected with family troubles (Humphreys, Correspondence of Philip Doddridge, iii. 424, iv. 408 sq.).
Career
They began writing hymns at their father's suggestion. They were not published until 1740 at least, and perhaps not until much later. Some were in Dr. Dodd's Christizan Magazine, 1763. In Dr. Dodd's Christian Magazine for 1764, there are a few hymns by this author. "All hail, incarnate God! ", No. 412, is listed as hymn No. 386 in Dobell's Collection, of 1806, where it has the name "Scott." The second verse beginning—"To Thee the hoary head," has this note—" Composed on seeing an Aged Saint and a Youth taken into Church communion together." Twenty-one were in Ash and Evans's Collection, 1769; and eight of these, with twelve new ones, in Dobell's Selection, 1806.
In a manuscript in the library of Yale College, Franklin Bowditch Dexter tabulated the hymns. They said (January 29, 1889):— "The label on the back of this volume is Hymns & Poems by Eliz. Scott. There is no title to the manuscript pages. Prefixed to the Hymns and Poems there is, however, a long and very tenderly written dedication (in prose) 'To my much Rever'd, much Lov'd, Father', this signed 'E. S.' and dated 1740. Then follows (without numbers) the Hymns with titles and first lines. Dexter added on the first lines and the titles of 90 hymns.
In a second manuscript headed "Poems on Several Occasions by Miss Scott of Norwich, who married to Mr. Williams of New England, January 1750/1." there follow 26 hymns in full. At the end this is written, "These transcribed from Maj. Williams' Manuscript, Feb. 27, 1751, the week before they left Norwich to go to New England." The whole of these 26 hymns are in Yale College.
A third manuscript contains eight hymns which ore prefaced with these words,— "Copied from a book of Mrs. Bury's, written by their Aunt Miss Elizabeth Scott, afterwards Mrs. Williamson." Of these hymns, six are in the Yale College and 2 not therein, viz.:—(1) "Arise and hail the happy [sacred] day" (p. 78, 1.). and "Hail, King supreme, all wise and good", both of which are given anonymously in the Unitarian Acu» CW. of Ps. for to Vie of a Cong, of Protatant Dissenters in Liverpool, commonly known as The Liverpool Liturgy, pub. in 1763. Concerning tho authorship of these two hymns there is great doubt.
In Dr. Dodd's Christian's Magazine for December 1763, a writer signs themselves "CL—T." They had at that time a manuscript of Scott's hymns with a Dedication to their father prefixed thereto and signed "Eliz Sc—tt." From this manuscript, they sent "Why droops my soul with guilt oppressed" (Christ, the Great Physician) to the December number of the magazine; "Evil and few our mortal days" (Vanity of human Life), to the February number, 1764, and "What finite power with ceaseless toil ("Praise for Temporal Blessings"), to the April number of the same year. At the close of the last hymn, they said in a note—"N.B. "As some of your Correspondents have sent you some pieces out of the same collection, from which these are transcribed, that I have undertaken to send you (e.g. that on Gen. xvii. l) it were to be wished, if they should do the like again, that they would signify whose they are." The hymn referred to in this note was, "Great God, Thy penetrating eye" (God pervading all things), which appeared in the January number of the Christian Magazine, 1784, without signature or acknowledgment of any kind. All these hymns are in the Yale College manuscript.
From these facts it is clear that before departing for the United States, Scott allowed copies of their hymns to be made from their manuscripts, and it was mainly from these copies that those of their hymns composed before their marriage were printed in the English hymnbooks. None of those hymns date later than 1750. The collections in which they appeared, and through which they came into collections were the Bristol Baptist College of Ash and Evans, 1769, and the New Selections, by J. Dobb, 1806. In Ash and Evans there are 19 hymns, signed "S.," all of which are in the Yale College manuscript. under the same first lines except "Was it for man, apostate man'/" but this also may possibly be there under another first line. In Dobell, there are 20 hymns signed "Scott", of which 17 are in the Yale College manuscript, two are parts of hymns from Ash and Evans-, also in that manuscript are and "Sole Sovereign of the earth and skies," also probably in the manuscript under another first line. Of the 90 hymns in the Yale manuscript, in addition to those annotated elsewhere in Julian's Dictionary of Hymnology, there are also in collections:—

The red-cowled cardinal (Paroaria dominicana) is a bird species in the tanager family (Thraupidae). It is not very closely related to the cardinals proper (Cardinalidae).
It is endemic to Brazil. It occurs in a wide range of dry to semi-humid open to semi-open habitats in north-eastern Brazil, especially the Caatinga region. It has been introduced (probably by means of escaped caged individuals) to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, being locally common even in urban areas.

Hatto Ständer (14 January 1929 – 10 August 2000) was a German church musician, academic, concert organist and composer. They were a professor of organ and choral conducting at the Dortmund University for three decades, and director of its department Catholic church music. Their compositions are mostly sacred music, but they also wrote piano music and chamber music. They served as an advisor to organ builders for notable organs in Dortmund.
Career
Born in Witten, Ständer showed musical talent early. They played the organ in church liturgies at age nine. At age 13, they became a pupil of the Musisches Gymnasium, a school specialising in music and arts, in Frankfurt, where they were inspired by Kurt Thomas who taught counterpoint, composition and conducting. Ständer studied piano and composition at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen. They were accepted to the piano master class of Carl Seemann at the Musikhochschule Freiburg, and won a prize at the Deutscher Hochschulklavierwettbewerb. They completed their studies of organ and church music at Dortmund University, where they taught from 1960 to 1992 organ, choral conducting, Gregorian chant and composition (Tonsatz). They were appointed Kirchenmusikdirektor and director of the department of Catholic church music in 1971, and professor in 1974.
Most of Ständer's compositions are dedicated to sacred music. They gave concerts in Germany and beyond, and made recordings with broadcasters. They were an advisor to organ builders, such as for the organ of the Propsteikirche in Dortmund, built by Siegfried Sauer. They designed an all-purpose instrument with French sound concepts in mind. They played the opening concert on 23 October 1988. They were instrumental in the concept for the organ at the Konzerthaus Dortmund, built by Klais Orgelbau, but did not live to see it built. They died in Dortmund in 2000.
Work
The publisher Verlag Dohr has printed Ständer's complete works, which includes besides their well-known sacred compositions also early piano and chamber works written in student years when they still considered a career as a composer. Most of these are first prints, based on the last autographs from their nachlass. Their sacred music is focused on a renewal of Catholic church music after the Second Vatican Council.

The Thomas Law House (Honeymoon House) was constructed between 1794 and 1796 near present-day 6th and N Streets, Southwest in Washington, D.C. The builder was a syndicate headed by James Greenleaf, an early land speculator in the District of Columbia.
In March 1796, Thomas Law moved into the house after their marriage to Martha Washington's eldest granddaughter, Eliza Parke Custis. The house became known as "Honeymoon House" as the Laws lived there during their honeymoon while awaiting completion of their house. They did not stay long, as by the summer of 1796 they have moved to their home on the west side of New Jersey Avenue north of C Street
Thomas Law was the son of Edmund Law, the Bishop of Carlisle. Among their brothers were:
John Law, Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, Bishop of Killala and Achonry, and Bishop of Elphin.
Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough, Lord Chief Justice 1802–1818.
George Henry Law, Bishop of Chester 1812–1824, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1824–1845.
Thomas Law spent many years in India, where they made a fortune in trade. Law came to Washington, D.C., in the summer of 1794. They were one of Washington's wealthiest citizens and was active, although not successful, in business enterprises. They eventually lost their fortune.
Law met Greenleaf in November or December 1794 and was deeply impressed with him. On December 4, 1794, Greenleaf sold 500 city lots to Law for £50,000 (or $133,000). The price per lot was $297.60, a 372 percent increase over the $80 per lot which Greenleaf had paid just a year earlier.
In 1816, former Congressman Richard Bland Lee and their wife Elizabeth (Collins) Lee purchased the house.
During the Civil War, it was the Mt. Vernon Hotel. Starting around 1913, it was the Washington Sanitarium's Mission Hospital. Dr. Henry G. Hadley operated a clinic in the house from 1923 to 1961.
The National Park Service listed the Thomas Law House on the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973.

The Favaloro Foundation (Fundación Favaloro para la Investigación y la Docencia Médica) is an Argentine scientific institution dedicated to medical teaching and research. It was founded in 1975 by René Favaloro with the support of the Cleveland Clinic in the United States where Favaloro worked for many years.
History
After working in medical research at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States, Favaloro decided to create a department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Anatomy in Buenos Aires.
In 1980 the Department of Teaching and Research (Departamento de Docencia e Investigación de la Fundación Favaloro) was founded and in the same year, in collaboration with the Department of Artificial Organs of the University of Utah, Favaloro implanted the first artificial heart. Between 1980 and 1982 the collaboration continued and 16 transplants were carried out. The patients were monitored by COMDU (Cardiac Output Monitoring and Diagnostic Unit) in order to improve the medical assistance provided to patients with artificial hearts. The project was canceled in 1982 due to budgetary problems but the Basic Investigation Unit (División de Investigación Básica) continued working on other coronary problems.
Over the years the Departamento de Docencia e investigación changed its name to The Biomedical Sciences University Institute (Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Biomédicas) and the Basic Investigation Unit changed its name to the Institute of Basic scientific Investigation (Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias Básicas). These projects eventually resulted in the creation of the Universidad Favaloro in 1998.
On June 2, 1992 the Institute of Cardiology and cardiovascular surgery (Instituto de Cardiología y Cirugía Cardiovascular) was inaugurated and on June 20, 1992 the first operation was carried out. Towards the end of the 20th Century the Favaloro Foundation became immersed in debt. For this reason and due to the overwhelming corruption of the health system, René Favaloro committed suicide with a gunshot to the heart on July 29, 2000.
Since their death the foundation has survived partly thanks to the bequest left by Favaloro, to remain one of the most important cardiovascular research institutions in Latin America.
Declaration and principles
Honesty
Work with passion, strength and sacrifice without limits.
Reject the influences of dogmatism, personal prejudice and agendas.
Your contributions have value only when they are the product of free will without limits.
Never neglect ethics and understand that they are necessary for the morale and the well being of the patients and their families.
Remember that humility is necessary to work in a team, the sacrifice of the individual benefits the collective. The development of science demonstrates this. The individual was replaced by the collective a long time ago.
You must sacrifice everything on the altar of the truth and nothing but the truth, always say what you think, nothing survives built on a foundation of lies.
If you alleviate the suffering of other people and at the same time improve human knowledge the satisfaction will be greater.
The basic subject of our work, and therefore the only beneficiary will be the patient.
The only true prize comes when your soul feels, in the silence of reflection, the spiritual pleasure of a job well done.

Taras Bogdanovych Levkiv (; born 25 June 1940) is an honored Ukrainian artist who specializes in ceramic art. Since the 1980s, they have been the head of the Department of Art Ceramics at Ivan Trush Lviv State College of Decorative and Fine Arts.
Life
Taras Levkiv was born on June 25, 1940, in the village of Mala Berezovytsia, now located in Zbarazh Raion, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine.  They are the son of Bogdan Andriyovych Levkiv (1912-1999) and Olga Ivanivna Levkiv (née Omelian) (1921-2013).
In 1964 they graduated from Lviv College of applied arts named in I. Trush (Ceramics Department). There they met their teacher Taras Dragan, with whom they would go on to develop a close relationship and the two would go on to enjoy year's of true friendship.
In 1971 they graduated from Lviv Institute of applied and decorative arts. At the end of 1970 there was their private student's exhibition in the town. The works they presented opened up new opportunities of an ancient method of potter's wheel, they had expressive ethnographic features.
They made an acquaintance with Peteris Martinson at a workshop in Dzintari (Latvia). Since that time the artist's works has been evolving as if in two directions. The first one represents bold experiments in the area of free creation which is officially forbidden in sculpture. The second one is in their ability to incarnate and carry to the spectator their own social-political persuasion in original artistic form.
In 1972 they became the first Representative from Ukraine on ІІІ International biennale in Valorize (France). They would later go on to receive honors in competitions on artistic ceramics in Faience (Italy; 1974, 1978, 1979, 1980).
In the 1980s T. Levkiv's range of artistic interests delved into another field. Levkiv began to give their priority to cosmological themes. They presented their works at 17 private exhibitions particularly in Tbilisi, Leningrad, Ternopil and other cities. The artist has taken part in 103 regional, all-Ukrainian and international exhibitions (Tartu, Estonia; Osaka, Japan; Zheshuv, Poland; Moscow, Russia etc).
For over 20 years Taras Bohdanovych has headed the Ceramics Department in Lviv College of decorative and applied arts named in I. Trush. They were a Deputy of Lviv regional administration of the First Democratic Convocation.
Over 10 years T. Levkiv has worked at public principles as a manager of projects at the construction in Vynnyky of Autocephalous Orthodox Church of the Saint Volodymyr and the Saint Olga.
On ІІІ All-Ukrainian symposium of ceramics in Opshnae (1999) they got I honor for decorative plastic work "Bilomorcanal".
Museums of Lviv, Ternopil, Tbilisi, the Saints-Petersburg, Berlin, Prague and other cities show to their visitors the artist's works.

Ken Gorman (July 12, 1946 – February 17, 2007) was a marijuana rights activist who was shot and killed in their home on February 17, 2007 in Colorado. They ran for Colorado state governor as a write-in candidate and supported pro-legalization candidates, particularly Libertarian candidate Ralph Shnelvar in the 1990s.
Biography
Gorman graduated from Denver's Lincoln High School in 1964. As their father had before him, Gorman joined the US Air Force, working as an air traffic controller. They worked in Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. They were stationed near Miyakojima in Japan at a long-range radar facility during the Vietnam War. Their first wife introduced them to marijuana in Loveland, Colorado in 1969. Gorman was often quoted as saying "It has been a friend of mine ever since." They went on to a career with the FAA as an air traffic controller. On August 5, 1981, while stationed in Hawaii, they were fired by Ronald Reagan along with 11,358 other PATCO (Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization) members who were on strike.
After that, they worked in Papua New Guinea, recruiting students for "western-style" schooling. Around 1984, they became very friendly with the natives and gave them a public voice with radio broadcasts and newspaper articles about natives rights. Although they were arrested and charged with many crimes, they were only ever convicted on possession of pornography (a Playboy magazine). They were given a plane ticket to Manila, some spending money, and was escorted to the airport. Gorman's good friend, Pious Wingti, took power in 1985. Wingti's election victory was significantly due to the public outrage over Gorman's deportation. Later, they assisted the Philippine rebels in their quest to overthrow Ferdinand Marcos. They were forcibly deported in 1985. The Filipino people succeeded in deposing Marcos the following year.
In 1992, while doing business-to-business sales for Video Professor, they read The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack Herer. Learning about "the marijuana conspiracy" made them so angry that they dedicated their life to revealing the truth about hemp and marijuana. Gorman started a company selling hemp products. They advertised marijuana in Denver's Westword Newspaper, on the locally famous "Back Page". The ad read, "MARIJUANA - FREE DELIVERY - NO COPS - NO JOKE". Later that year, Gorman started holding "smoke-ins" on the steps of the Colorado capitol building. One of their 1993 rallies featured "The Emperor Of Hemp", Jack Herer. They ran for Colorado state governor in 1994 and 1998.
Arrest and death
In May 1999, Gorman allowed themselves to be arrested for selling three pounds of marijuana to a police informant who claimed to be buying it for medicinal purposes. Gorman served six months in the Jefferson County jail, 16 months in a Cañon City minimum-security facility, 18 months in a halfway house, and two years wearing a monitoring ankle bracelet. In 2000, Colorado adopted a constitutional amendment creating a medical marijuana system. After realizing the severe lack of medical grade marijuana available for patients, Gorman worked tirelessly to sign up caregivers to increase the availability of medicinal marijuana. They supported Libertarian candidates Rick Stanley for Senate and Boulder's Ralph Shnelvar for governor in 2002.
The rallies continued several times a year, but Gorman had to "officially" remove their name as organizer due to the RAVE Act of 2002 and the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003. They supplied as many patients with caregivers or medicinal marijuana as they could. In 2004/2005, they were a featured speaker at meetings of the Colorado Compassion Club in Denver which was co-founded by themselves and cannabis pioneer and Social Equity activist Larisa Bolivar. Likely due to their marijuana advocacy and activism, their home was frequently targeted by burglars.
On February 17, 2007, in Denver, Colorado, Gorman was shot in the chest in their living room.

Kamalakara (1616 – 1700) was an Indian astronomer and mathematician, came from a learned family of scholars from Golagrāma, a village situated in Maharashtra State near Partha-puri (Pathari) on the northern bank of the river Godāvarī. Their father was Nrsimha who was born in 1586. Two of Kamalakara's three brothers were also astronomer and mathematicians: Divakara, who was the eldest of the brothers born in 1606, and Ranganatha who was youngest. Kamalākara learnt astronomy from their elder brother Divākara, who compiled five works on astronomy. Their family later moved to Vārāṇasī.
Major works
Kamalākara's major work, "Siddhāntatattvaviveka", was compiled in Varanasi at about 1658 and has been published by Sudhakar Dwivedi in the Vārāṇasī series. This work consists of 13 chapters in 3,024 verses. It deals with the topics of: units of time measurement; mean motions of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; diameters and distances of the planets; the earth's shadow; the moon's crescent; risings and settings; syzygies; lunar eclipses, solar eclipses; planetary transits across the sun's disk; the patas of the moon and sun; the "great problems"; along a conclusion. Their other works include Śeṣavāsanā and Sauravāsanā. Kamalākara was bitterly opposed to Munishvara, the author of Siddhāntasārvabhauma.
It is wrongly believed by some moderners that Kamalākara discovered the idea that the pole star we see at present is not exactly at the pole. But these ideas was first expressed in Brahmananda Purana and Matsya Purana by sage Veda Vyaasa: "uttAnapAda-putro-asau meDhibhooto dhruvo divi | sa hi bhraman bhtaamayate nityam chandraadityau grahaiH saha ||". The meaning of this expression is "Uttanapada's son Dhruva is fixed like a pole in the Heaven, but it is moving itself and is making all the planets together with Sun and Moon move".
Kamalākara's contribution was to rejuvenate this forgotten idea.
Contribution
They combined traditional Indian astronomy with Aristotelian physics and Ptolemaic astronomy as presented by Islamic scientists.
In the third chapter of the Siddhanta-tattva-viveka Kamalakara used the addition and subtraction theorems for the sine and the cosine to give trigonometric formulae for the sines and cosines of double, triple, quadruple and quintuple angles. In particular they give formulae for sin(A/2) and sin(A/4) in terms of sin(A) and iterative formulae for sin(A/3) and sin(A/5).
According to David Pingree, they present the only Sanskrit treatise on geometrical optics.
They have assumed a value of 60 units for the radius of the Earth and gives values for sines at 1° intervals.
Kamalākara also gives a table for finding the right ascension of a planet from its longitude

Beit Guvrin-Maresha National Park is a national park in central Israel, 13 kilometers from Kiryat Gat, encompassing the ruins of Maresha, one of the important towns of Judah during the time of the First Temple, and Beit Guvrin, an important town in the Roman era, when it was known as Eleutheropolis.
Archaeological artifacts unearthed at the site include a large Jewish cemetery, a Roman-Byzantine amphitheater, a Byzantine church, public baths, mosaics and burial caves.
History
The earliest written record of Maresha was as a city in ancient Judah (Joshua 15:44). The Hebrew Bible mentions among other episodes that Rehoboam fortified it against Egyptian attack. After the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah the city of Maresha became part of the Edomite kingdom. In the late Persian period a Sidonian community settled in Maresha, and the city is mentioned in the Zenon Papyri (259 BC). During the Maccabean Revolt, Maresha was a base for attacks against Judea and suffered retaliation from the Maccabees. After Hasmonean king John Hyrcanus I captured and destroyed Maresha in 112 BCE, the region of Idumea remained under Hasmonean control. In 40 BC the Parthians devastated completely the "strong cite", after which it was never rebuilt.
Beth Gabra or Beit Guvrin succeeded Maresha as the main town of the area. Conquered by the Roman general Vespasian during the Jewish War (68 CE) and completely destroyed during the Bar Kochba revolt (132–135 CE), it was re-established as a Roman colony and in the year 200 it received the title of a city and the ius italicum, under the new name of "Eleutheropolis", 'city of freemen'. Sources from the Byzantine period mention both Christian and Jewish personalities living in the city.
History of archaeological excavations
Maresha was first excavated in 1898–1900 by Bliss and Macalister, who uncovered a planned and fortified Hellenistic city encircled by a town wall with towers. Two Hellenistic and one Israelite stratum were identified by them on the mound. Many of the ancient city's olive presses, columbaria and water cisterns can still be seen.
Both Maresha and Beit Guvrin/Eleutheropolis were excavated after 1989 and 1992 respectively by the Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner. Important finds at the latter site were the amphitheater built by the Roman army units stationed there, a large Roman bath house, and from the Crusader period a fortress integrating the walls of the Roman amphitheater and bath house, as well as an attached church.
Archaeological remains
Burial caves
The Sidonian burial caves were the family tomb of Apollophanes, the leader of the Sidonian community in Beit Guvrin. The Sidonian caves are the only ones that are painted inside. The caves were burial caves for the Greek, Sidonian and Edumite inhabitants of Beit Guvrin. The first and largest cave has paintings of animals, real and mythic, above the niches where the corpses were laid. A cock crows to scare away demons; the three-headed dog Cerberus guards the entrance to the underworld; a bright red phoenix symbolizes the life after death. The Tomb of the Musicians is decorated with a painting showing a man playing the flute and a woman playing the harp.
Bell caves
There are about 800 bell-shaped caves located in the area. Many of the caves are linked via an underground network of passageways that connect groups of 40–50 caves.
The largest bell caves are in the east part of the park. They have been dug since prehistoric times, the excavations reaching their zenith in the Hellenistic period and during the Byzantine and Early Arab Period, when blocks of chalkstone extracted from the caves were used for construction work (buildings, etc.). The bell caves consist of limestone in their upper-layer (to a depth of about one to two meters), beneath which is rock consisting solely of a beige-colored, soft chalkstone, utilized by its early inhabits for carving caverns and dwellings. There are numerous bell caves within the park grounds and events are held in one of them. They are large (over high), airy and easily accessible.
Columbaria
The National Park is known for some of the best preserved columbaria from the Hellenistic and Roman periods. One of the largest is located on the west side of Tell Maresha (Khurbet es Sandahannah), described by Conder and Kitchener in their Survey of Western Palestine, and formerly known by its local inhabitants as Es Sûk. It has been carved underground from the soft chalkstone endemic to the area, and built with tiers of niches capable of housing hundreds of brooding pigeons.
Cave dwellings
There are a number of cave-like dwellings carved from the chalkstone bedrock, some of which display a vast extension of networks and passageways, with staircases descending down into the depth, made with step-like balustrades, and replete with cisterns for storing water and millstones for grinding olives. These caverns and dwellings, though not situated on the eminence of the Tell itself, were considered part and parcel with the city of Maresha itself, as they were later enclosed by a wall that encompassed both the city and its expanded suburbs. The largest and most impressive of these caverns and dwelling places is that built near the Tell on its southeast side, and which the locals knew by the name Mŭghâret Sandahannah (The Cave of Saint Anne). Today, in Modern Hebrew, the same cave dwelling is called Mavokh (Maze).
The Church of Saint Anne
Saint Anne's church was first built in the Byzantine period and then rebuilt by the Crusaders in the 12th century. The ruin is known in Arabic as Khirbet (lit. "ruin") Sandahanna, the nearby tell (mound) of Maresha being called Tell Sandahanna. The freestanding remains of the apse are well preserved (see photo).
Amphitheater
The remains of a Roman amphitheater were uncovered in the mid-1990s. The amphitheater was built in the 2nd century, on the northwestern outskirts of Beit Guvrin. This amphitheater, in which gladiatorial contests took place, could seat about 3,500 spectators. It had a walled arena of packed earth, with subterranean galleries. The arena was surrounded by a series of connected barrel vaults, which formed a long, circular corridor and supported the stone seats above it; staircases led from the outside and from the circular corridor to the tribunes. It was built for the Roman troops stationed in the region after the suppression of the Bar Kochba rebellion. The amphitheater is an elliptical structure built of large rectangular limestone ashlars. It was in use until destroyed in the Galilee earthquake of 363.
Mosaics
Byzantine mosaics depicting birds and animals were discovered on the hilltop in 1924.

Darrin John Chapin (born February 1, 1966) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) during the 1991 and 1992 seasons. Listed at 6 feet 0 inches, 170 lb., they batted and threw right-handed.
Career
Chapin was a 1984 graduate of Champion High School, where they lettered three years in both football and basketball. They were an outstanding quarterback for the Golden Flashes football team and still holds the single-game passing record of 279 yards. As the point guard for the Flashes basketball team, they averaged eleven points and seven assists per game. Additionally, they lettered all four years in baseball. While pitching for the Flashes, they led their team to three league championships and received All-Ohio honors in baseball in their senior year. Notably, they are the only Champion High School alumni to have played in Major League Baseball.
Chapin later attended Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio, where they played for the Tri-C's Baseball team. Following their graduation, they enrolled at Cleveland State University in Ohio and was a member of the Cleveland State Vikings Baseball club in 1985, joining Dale Mohorcic as the only Tri-C's/Vikings players to perform in the Major Leagues.
The New York Yankees selected Chapin in the sixth round of the 1986 MLB Draft out of Cuyahoga Community College. They spent six years in the organization from 1986 to 1991, which included a brief stint with the big club in 1991. Chapin made three relief appearances for the Yankees and lost a decision, allowing three earned runs on three hits and six walks while striking out five in innings of work.
In 1992, Chapin was sent to the Philadelphia Phillies in the same transaction that brought Charlie Hayes to the Yankees. Chapin pitched two innings of relief in their only appearance for the Phillies, giving up three earned runs on two hits, and struck out a batter without walks. Overall, they posted a 0–1 record and a 6.14 ERA with six strikeouts and six walks in 7 ⅓ innings.
Besides the Yankees and Indians, Chaplin played for the Minnesota Twins, Florida Marlins and Cleveland Indians in their Minor League systems. In ten seasons from 1986 to 1995, they went 40–28 with a 3.48 ERA and 15 saves in 367 games. They also pitched with the Broncos de Reynosa of the Mexican League in 1995, going 1–1 with a 1.48 ERA and three saves in 11 games.
In between, Chapin played winter ball with the Navegantes del Magallanes, Tigres de Aragua and Leones del Caracas clubs of the Venezuelan League in three seasons spanning 1990–1993. They compiled an overall record of 7–3 with a 3.92 ERA and seven saves in 38 pitching appearances, including seven as a starter.

Poh Ern Shih () is located on a small hilltop at Chwee Chian Road, off Pasir Panjang Road, on Singapore's southern coast. The Buddhist temple was built as a memorial to those who lost their lives during the Battle of Pasir Panjang in 1942, villagers as well as Allied and Japanese soldiers. The temple's first abbot, Sumangalo, an American Theravadin monk, was the first Westerner to be appointed abbot of a Buddhist temple in Singapore.
Following a major development project which began in 2003, Poh Ern Shih became the first religious building in the country to incorporate both eco-friendly and elderly-friendly features. Together with its partner, the Buddhist Fellowship, the temple conducts programmes such as Dharma talks, Sutta discussions and meditation courses in Chinese and English for the Buddhist community.
History
Poh Ern Shih is located on the top of Chwee Chian Hill, off Pasir Panjang Road, on Singapore's southern coast. Facing the hilltop is Bukit Chandu ('Opium Hill' in Malay), where the British East India Company had an opium factory to process raw opium from the Golden Triangle for sale to China and South East Asia in the 19th century. To protect its military facilities in the vicinity, the British colonial government placed heavy artillery guns on Chwee Chian Hill before the onset of the Second World War, in anticipation of seaborne attacks by the Japanese off the coast of Pasir Panjang.
During the Battle of Pasir Panjang, Bukit Chandu was the last bastion of the 1st and 2nd Battalion Malay Regiment who, together with the 2nd Loyals Regiment, defended the western and southern parts of Singapore from 8–14 February 1942. Despite running low on ammunition and food, the Malay Regiments put up strong resistance, inflicting a heavy toll on the Japanese invaders. Outnumbered, the defenders were finally overrun and massacred by reinforced Japanese forces. A Malay officer, Second Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi, was captured alive and tortured by the Japanese, before being executed. The story of their heroism became well known throughout Singapore.
Founder Lee Choon Seng
Based on the concept of liberating the spirits of the soldiers and civilians who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II, the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed on the site of the bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill. It was established in 1954 as a modest single storey temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng (1888—1966), as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.
Lee was born in Yong Choon county, Fujian province, in China. They joined their father in Negri Sembilan in their youth, before moving to Singapore to set up their own property business. They were very successful, and achieved positions of leadership in the local Chinese community. They were widely known as one of the co-founders of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), and was its acting chairperson during the Japanese Occupation. As one of the early Buddhist pioneers, Lee was also involved in the foundation of the Buddhist Publications Circulation Centre in 1933, and the Singapore Buddhist Lodge in 1934.
First Western abbot
Venerable Sumangalo (1903—1963) was born as Robert Stuart Clifton in a devout Christian family in Birmingham, Alabama in the United States in 1903. After receiving their Doctorate in Literature, they lectured on Buddhism in the United States before moving to Asia to further their study of Buddhism. In 1957, they joined the Theravada Order in Laos and received the monastic name Sumangalo, meaning "very auspicious". They then left for Malaya and later visited Singapore on a spiritual tour in late 1959 with another American Buddhist monk, Venerable Susiddhi. Through their efforts, a number of Youth Circles and Sunday schools were set up locally.
In January 1959, they were invited to be the honorary abbot of Poh Ern Shih, thus becoming the first Westerner to be the abbot of a Buddhist temple in Singapore. While in Singapore, they assisted Pitt Chin Hui in their translation of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra from Chinese to English. They returned to Malaya and spent their later years at Penang Buddhist Association, where most of their Dhamma lectures were held. Their lectures were later compiled in English and Chinese and are still freely distributed. Venerable Sumangalo passed away on 6 February 1963 and was cremated in Penang.
Female Buddhist pioneer
Pitt Chin Hui (1906—1981) was born to a wealthy family in Guangzhou, China. They were the youngest child of the family, and was taken by their mother to Penang to receive their early education. In 1924, they sat for the Senior Cambridge Examination, and while waiting for the examination results they became an English teacher at the Fujian Girls' School. In 1927, they left for further studies at the Zhongshan University in Guangzhou. However, they terminated their tertiary studies and returned to Penang when their mother became seriously ill. While in Penang, they attended Dharma lectures by Venerable Taixu and their disciple, Venerable Cihang, at the Kek Lok Si Temple. Pitt subsequently became one of Cihang's disciples, and studied under him. They were responsible for setting up the Maha Bodhi School in Penang and Singapore (1946), to promote Buddhist education to the young. Along with their school duties, Pitt was also an active voluntary worker in the Buddhist community.
In December 1959, Pitt embarked on the task of translating the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra from Chinese to English at Poh Ern Shih, so that it would be accessible to the English-educated. Venerable Sumangalo assisted Pitt in their translation tasks, as well as offering suggestions for improving the English version. In 1964, Pitt was awarded the Public Service Star—BBM (Bintang Bakti Masharakat)—by Encik Yusof bin Ishak, the First President of the Republic of Singapore. In 1973, they were appointed as Justice of the Peace by the Second President Dr. Benjamin Henry Sheares. Pitt Chin Hui was also a Vice-President of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. They died in 1981 while on a trip in India.
Building design
To allow for expansion, the old premises were demolished. Reconstruction began in 2003, and the office wing was completed in April 2007, in phase 1 of the project. The new six-storey building was designed by Lee Coo, who is also the architect behind the Venerable Hong Choon Memorial Hall of the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple. Occupying a freehold site, the new Poh Ern Shih is an architectural synthesis of classical features combined with modern eco-friendly technology.
Civic consciousness
Conscious that a large percentage of its devotees were in their 60s, the Honorary President/Director of Poh Ern Shih, Lee Boon Siong, a retired lawyer, grandson of the temple's founder, and its chief architect, strove to ensure that the temple was accessible to the elderly and those who use wheelchairs. A gentle driveway stretches from the gates to the upper levels of the temple, and every storey of the building has level flooring. The lavatory cubicles are fitted with easily reached "call-for-help" buttons, and the doors are designed so that they can be unlocked from the outside in the case of emergency.
Eco-friendly features
The temple takes advantage of Singapore's abundant sunlight by having three different kinds of solar energy cells on its rooftop. They are the poly-crystalline silicon solar array, mono-crystalline silicon solar array and amorphous silicon solar array. Poh Ern Shih's water is heated by its solar panels, and its night lighting is powered by electricity converted from solar energy, With its breezy location, wind generators have also been erected to convert wind activity into electricity.
The rainwater which falls on Poh Ern Shih is collected from surface run-offs and rain gutters and used to irrigate the temple grounds, as well as to generate electricity used for charging the batteries of in-house motorised wheelchairs. The electricity is produced by water from the highest floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators. A purification system is also being installed, so that the collected rainwater can be filtered and made potable.
In line with the aim to make use of renewable resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo. Bamboo is considered to one of the most ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree. There is therefore no need for replanting, and the bamboo is allowed to regain its full height again over about five years, ready to be harvested again.
The second phase of the temple was completed in late 2008, featuring a new Main Ksitigarbha Prayer Hall as well as a Guanyin Meditation Hall with lapis lazuli statues and a 7-storey stupa.
The temple today
To reinvigorate itself and attract younger blood, Poh Ern Shih entered into a partnership with the Buddhist Fellowship
, a non-sectarian Buddhist organisation known locally for its revolutionary projects and activities intended to ensure that the Dharma is propagated in contemporary language and form. The Fellowship—whose more than 2,000 members are mainly English-speaking professionals, mostly under 45 years of age—initially rented space at Eton House in Paya Lebar. Lee Boon Siong contacted the Fellowship's President, Angie Monksfield, a Chinese Singaporean married to an English Catholic, offering use of the temple premises. In early 2007, Angie took up the offer after the rent for Eton House was raised by 57 per cent—a sum which was difficult for the fellowship to afford. The rent charged by the temple is the same as that which the Fellowship was paying before the increase demanded by its previous landlord.
The Fellowship moved into its of space in Poh Ern Shih on 29 May 2007. The event was marked by an opening ceremony attended by Khaw Boon Wan, Minister for Health, and the Fellowship's two spiritual patrons, Ajahn Brahm and Venerable Kwang Sheng, Abbot of Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple. The group conducts programmes such as Dharma talks, Sutta discussions and meditation courses led by visiting Sangha and notable lay Buddhist teachers such as Piya Tan, Dr. Ang Beng Choo and Prof. Tan Hun Tong and many more. The temple is open to the public daily, and admission is free.

State Route 204 (SR 204) is a state highway in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States, that connects Memphis and Millington.
Route description
SR 204 starts at the intersection of Stratford Road and Macon Road in Memphis, about a mile (south of Interstate 40 (I‑40). The road (locally known as Covington Pike), passes over the Wolf River after its interchange with I‑40. Between here and Raleigh–Lagrange Road are numerous car dealerships; Covington Pike is best known regionally for this. SR 204 continues north into the Memphis neighborhood of Raleigh, crossing SR 15 (Stage Road) and SR 14 (Austin Peay Highway). At this intersection, SR 204 changes into Sgt. Walter K. Singleton Parkway (Singleton Parkway), a four-lane divided highway with a speed limit. This route was named for Walter K. Singleton, a Memphis native, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor as a result of the Vietnam War. This is one of the main routes for residents who commute from Millington to Memphis. After passing over the Loosahatchie River, SR 204 ends at SR 385 (Paul Barret Parkway—future I&8209;269). Singleton Parkway continues north into Naval Support Activity Mid-South and further on to SR 205 (Navy Road) in Millington, ending on the east side of the Millington-Memphis Airport. However, the base is closed to through traffic, so through traffic must go onto SR 385 in order to go to Millington.
History
Up until the 1970s, Covington Pike ran from Raleigh–Lagrange Road to just south of its current junction with Austin Peay Highway (SR 14). However, instead of taking a turn towards the west along the current route, Covington Pike continued north and crossed Austin Peay Highway north of where it does today. Covington Pike crossed over SR 14 several times in somewhat discontinuous sections, over the Loosahatchie River, and past the community of Rosemark. In theory, one could get to Covington (about north of Memphis) by having traveled this route as its name suggests. Once in Tipton County, the route is known as Old Memphis Road (or Old Brighton Road in the city of Covington), which is more continuous and still goes from the Tipton County line to Covington. Today, segments of the old Covington Pike still exist, but are mainly dead ends.
Singleton Parkway was built in the 1970s from Austin Peay to Egypt Central Road, and was extended north to Millington in the 1980s.

The black-crowned tanager or black-crowned palm-tanager (Phaenicophilus palmarum) is a species of bird of the family Phaenicophilidae, which was formerly placed in the family Thraupidae. It is endemic to the island of Hispaniola (split between Haiti and the Dominican Republic) in the Caribbean.
Habitat
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical mangrove forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, and heavily degraded former forest.
Taxonomy
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black-crowned tanager in their Ornithologie. They used the French name Le palmiste and the Latin name Merula palmarum. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated their Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition in 1766, they added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson; one of them was the black-crowned tanager. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Turdus palmarum and cited Brisson's work. The specific name palmarum is the Latin for "of palm trees". The species is now placed in the genus Phaenicophilus that was introduced by the English geologist and naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland in 1851.

James Michael Hettes (born June 9, 1987) is a retired American mixed martial artist who competed as a featherweight in the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
Background
Hettes is a 2-time Keystone State Games Judo Gold Medalist and earned the nickname "Judo Jim" at Greg Jackson's Camp in Albuquerque, NM. Hettes started boxing at age 14 and started training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the age of 16 and is currently the head instructor at Northeastern Ju-Jitsu in Swoyersville, Pennsylvania. Hettes attended Luzerne County Community College for Criminal Justice.
Ultimate Fighting Championship
Hettes was originally expected to make their UFC debut in December 2010 as part of The Ultimate Fighter: Team GSP vs. Team Koscheck Finale card; Hettes turned the offer down due to prior engagements with another promotion. On July 16, 2011, Hettes officially signed with the UFC after winning the MMA Melee - MASS Featherweight Championship Belt.
As a late replacement to an injured Leonard Garcia. Hettes made their promotional debut on August 14, 2011 against Alex Caceres on 10 days notice. They won via submission (rear naked choke) at 3:12 of round 2.
Hettes defeated Nam Phan on December 30, 2011 at UFC 141. Hettes used their superior judo to take Phan down repeatedly, and also utilized excellent control on the ground. They landed a great deal of unanswered ground and pound and threatened with submissions throughout, taking a dominant unanimous decision (30-25, 30-25, 30-26).
Hettes was expected to face Steven Siler on June 22, 2012 at UFC on FX 4. However, Hettes was forced out of the bout with an injury and replaced by promotional newcomer Joey Gambino.
Hettes faced Marcus Brimage on September 22, 2012 at UFC 152. They lost the fight via unanimous decision, their first professional loss.
Hettes was expected to face Steven Siler on April 27, 2013 at UFC 159. However, Hettes was forced to pull out of the bout with an injury and replaced by Kurt Holobaugh.
After 13 months away, Hettes returned to the UFC in October 2013. They were expected to face Mike Wilkinson on October 26, 2013 at UFC Fight Night 30. However, Wilkinson pulled out of the bout in the week leading up the bout and was replaced by newcomer Robert Whiteford. Hettes won the fight via submission in the second round.
Hettes next faced Dennis Bermudez on March 15, 2014 at UFC 171. They lost the bout via TKO due to strike in the third round.
Hettes was expected to face Diego Brandão on January 31, 2015 at UFC 183. However, the fight was canceled right before the event started, as Hettes passed out backstage. They were taken to a local hospital for precautionary reasons. Subsequently, the bout with Brandão was rescheduled for April 18, 2015 at UFC on Fox 15. During a back-and-forth first round, an elbow strike from Brandão opened up Hettes' cauliflower ear. The attending doctor stopped the fight between the first and second rounds, resulting in a TKO loss for Hettes.
Hettes was expected to face Charles Rosa on January 17, 2016 at UFC Fight Night 81, but pulled out of the fight due to injury.

Neshaminy High School is a large public high school in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is the only high school in the Neshaminy School District, serving students in Middletown and Lower Southampton townships and Hulmeville, Langhorne, Langhorne Manor, and Penndel boroughs. In 2022, the school had an enrolment of 2,677 students in grades 9-12th. The school is highly ranked, placing 117th out of 718 PA high schools in the 2022 edition of U.S. News's annual ranking of the best high schools in Pennsylvania.
History
Before the 1950s, most of Lower Bucks County was rural farmland. In 1922, Langhorne Borough and Middletown Township signed an agreement to create a joint high school at the corner of Cherry Street and Maple Avenue known as Langhorne-Middletown High School. By 1946, Langhorne Manor, Penndel, Hulmeville, and shortly after that, Lower Southampton joined the agreement to expand the existing Langhorne-Middletown High School. The plan changed when it was revealed that William J. Levitt was planning to build one of America's first fully planned communities, known as Levittown, that would be partially located in Middletown Township. Because of this, along with new housing developments in other parts of the district, it was agreed upon that a brand new high school was needed. Neshaminy High School would open in 1953 as a 7-12 school.
As the district continued its rapid expansion in the 1960s, Neshaminy High School underwent multiple expansions. However, the district eventually decided that it needed a second high school. In 1975, Neshaminy-Maple Point High School opened in the district's northern end, with the existing Neshaminy High School being given the new name Neshaminy-Langhorne High School. Shortly after its opening, the district saw a rapid population decline, leading to the closure of Neshaminy-Maple Point only eight years after it opened, reuniting the entire district under a single Neshaminy Senior High School. The former Neshaminy-Maple Point High School would reopen in 1993 as Maple Point Middle School.
In 2003, the Neshaminy school board proposed the demolition of the current school building and construction of a new facility on current school grounds. This plan was priced at $100 million and would require the issuance of an $85 million tax funded bond. In April 2004, residents defeated the new building plan via referendum due in large part to the price.
As an alternative plan, the school board decided to demolish sections of the school and rebuild them as the school year proceeded. This major renovation project was estimated to cost $72 million and would replace 95% of classroom facilities but retain some existing structures like the auditorium, gym, cafeteria, and library. Unlike the rest of the school, which has only received basic upkeep since the 1950s, these facilities have already undergone major renovation as recently as 1995. Neshaminy completed the project in September 2009. Once the construction finished, the school welcomed 9th graders back for the first time in 3 decades, providing them with new learning opportunities they did not receive while the grade was housed in the middle schools.
Name controversy
Neshaminy High School athletic teams are known as the Redskins. In 2012, a Neshaminy parent of Native American descent started a campaign to change the name because of its racially offensive and harmful nature. The parent spoke at numerous board meetings, though Neshaminy made no progress. A complaint was filed with Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) in 2013. After a thorough investigation, the PHRC ruled against the Neshaminy school district. The PHRC ruled that Neshaminy must change the name along with other terms of adjustment, which the school administration appealed.
On October 23, 2013, the student editorial board of the high school's newspaper, The Playwickian, declared its intention to no longer reference the team with the term "Redskin" in its publications. The school administration declared that the Playwickian editorial board lacked the power to decide to stop using the term "Redskins". On April 2, 2014, students Jackson Haines and Emily Scott received awards from the 2014 Scholastic Keystone Press Awards contest from articles published in The Playwickian on the issue. Haines would also receive a Gold Circle Award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association later that year for the same article. In early July, the Pennsylvania High School Press Association awarded Journalism Teacher of the Year to Tara Huber, an adviser for The Playwickian for assisting the students in publishing.
In May 2014, a student submitted an opinion editorial containing the "Redskin" term. The Neshaminy principal demanded that The Playwickian run the piece and threatened that the final issue would not be allowed to be distributed otherwise. The Playwickian ran its last issue of the year without the piece a few days later. Neshaminy reacted by censoring the issue, confiscating the publication, calling for an emergency meeting with co-editor Gillian McGoldrick, and restricting access to Playwickian social media and website accounts. McGee would later defend their actions in a statement on the website for the school. On June 26, 2014, the Neshaminy board allowed The Playwickian to ban the term "Redskin" in articles, but required the paper to publish editorials and letters to the editor with the term present and unedited.
In 2015, the PHRC made a preliminary finding that the name Redskins is "racially derogatory" and creates a "hostile educational environment." The case then proceeded to a full commission hearing. After six years of controversy, the PHRC held a hearing in January 2019.
In November 2019, the PHRC ruled that Neshaminy could continue to use the name but must cease using any imagery promoting negative stereotypes of Native Americans and must educate its students about Native American history to prevent the use of stereotypes. The school district spent over $400,000 in legal fees in its campaign to retain the Redskin nickname.
Curriculum
In the 2020-2021 school year, 25% of students were proficient in the English Keystones, 76.7% were proficient in the Algebra Keystones, and 85.3% were proficient in the Biology Keystones. These scores may be lower than in previous years due to the impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
In 2015–2016, Neshaminy students took Advanced Placement (AP) exams in the following areas:
Biology
Calculus AB
Chemistry
English Language & Composition
English Literature & Composition

Gym Night
In 1953-54, Neshaminy High School, still unfinished, opened its doors, and the first Gym Night began. By the theme of "FUN NIGHT", two teams, Red and Blue, began competition. Space was a premium, facilities limited, but the show went on and included such events as cheerleading, decorations, sportsmanship, and organization. Gym Night has grown into a community-wide sensation in which the student body is divided into the Blue (last names beginning with A-K) and Red (last names beginning with L-Z) teams. These two nights in late winter are filled with exciting dance exhibitions, designed and choreographed by the students, and relays between the Red and Blue teams. At the end of the second day, one team is crowned champion based on choreography, decorations, performance in relays, and sportsmanship.
Playwickian
The Playwickian is the school's newspaper and has received awards from Columbia University for outstanding performance. Due to being a Pennsylvania student publication, The Playwickian is subjected to and granted certain rights by Section 12.9 of the Pennsylvania Code.

Soccer
The soccer program has four state championship titles. The Boys' program won PIAA State Championships in 1982, 1984, and 1994. The Girls' program won the title in 2013.
Football
The first football team was assembled in 1928 when the school was known as Langhorne-Middletown High School. Of notable success in the early years is when head coach Mike DeRisi led the team to a combined record of 14-4-2 in 1946 and 1947. The team became a traditional powerhouse when head coach Harry E. Franks took over the team from 1952 through 1959. Under the direction of Franks, the team compiled a 69-10-2 record (.792%), scored 2203 points for to 857 points against, and had undefeated seasons in 1954 and 1956. John Petercuskie took over the head coaching reins from 1960 through 1965 and led the team to a 59-1-5 record (.983%), scored 1925 points for to 410 points against, 26 shutout victories, undefeated seasons between 1960 and 1965, except 1961, with a 51-game unbeaten streak starting in 1961 and lasting until 1965. Jack Swartz coached the team from 1968 through 1972, compiling a 43-11-1 record (.796%). The 1971 team, which had an 11–0 perfect record, is widely regarded as one of the best in Pennsylvania history and by some as Pennsylvania's team of the century. In 1988, coach John Chaump took a team with an 11–0 regular-season record to the semi-finals of the first-ever Pennsylvania state playoffs (statewide). Head coach Mark Schmidt (1995–present) has continued the winning tradition with a 119–54 overall record, a regular-season record of 102–38 (since 1996), and a state playoff record of 16–6. Schmidt's resume also includes 3 conference championships (01, 05, 08), 2 conference co-championships (02, 04), 7 state playoff appearances (01-09, except 03 and 06), 3 district-one championship appearances (01, 04, 08), 2 district-one championships (01, 04), 2 eastern PA championship appearances (01, 04), 2 eastern PA championships (01, 04), 2 PA state championship appearances (01, 04), and 1 PA state championship (2001). The 2001 team compiled a perfect 15-0 overall record while running back Jamar Brittingham carried the ball for in 14 games.

Alain Morisod (born 23 June 1949) is a Swiss musician and television producer, known for forming Sweet People who had a UK number 4 hit in 1980 with "Et Les Oiseaux Chantaient (And the Birds Were Singing)".
Early life
Morisod grew up with an older brother, Maurice, born 3 April 1946. They did also have another brother, Jean-Claude, born 23 October 1947, but they died only 4 days after being born. At the age of 9, Morisod lost their father, Jean, who was a butcher in the Geneva district, Saint-Gervais. Following the encouragement of their mother, Maguerite, they then learned to play the piano. They studied at the Institut Florimont between 1958 and 1968 and then went on to study in the Faculty of Law at the University of Geneva, from 1968 to 1970. They then went on to study at the Conservatoire de Musique and the Conservatoire Populaire, both in Geneva.
Music career
From 1967, Morisod was a piano accompanist for artists such as Arlette Zola, Henri Dès and Fernand Raynaud. Their first single, "Concerto pour un été", was released in Switzerland on 27 April 1971, which Morisod also composed and produced. Then, soon after, producer Henri Belolo called Morisod saying that they wanted to release the song in France. The only problem was that the name Morisod sounded too 'Swiss', so Belolo proposed replacing it with Alain Patrick, which Morisod accepted. The single was then released in France in June. The song was a hit, selling over 2 million copies, becoming a Top 40 hit in France and also reaching number 46 in Wallonia. The following year, it once again reached the Top 40 in France. However, the song became a bigger hit in 1973 in Brazil where it was number 1 for 9 weeks. The album of the same name also reached at least number 10 in France. A remix of song, with seagull cries and the noise of waves, was also released at the request of radio station RTL, as it sounded more 'new age'.
In 1977, Morisod formed Sweet People to participate in the 1978 Eurovision Song Contest. Their song "Hey, le musicien" came second in the national finals, losing out to "Vivre" by Carole Vinci, which Morisod had also composed. In February 1978, "Le Lac de Côme" was released and was a number 1 in Canada and the album of the same name was certified platinum. The song had originally been released as the B-side to "Crystal Tears" the previous year, but to their astonishment, Morisod got a call from Quebecois producer , to say that the song could work in Canada and so it was then released there.
After its success, Morisod's brother, Maurice, came up with the idea of removing the piano part from the song and adding in birdsong. This became "Et Les Oiseaux Chantaient", which was quickly included on their album Percé. The song was released in the UK in 1980 with the parenthesised "And the Birds Were Singing", where it peaked at number 4 in the charts. It was also a Top Ten hit in Flanders and the Netherlands and a Top 40 hit in Germany. The song charted again in the UK in 1987, reaching number 73. Sweet People achieved further success with "Adieu et Bonne Chance", which reached number 25 in France in 1985.
For the 1982 Eurovision Song Contest, Morisod composed the Swiss entry "Amour on t'aime", sung by Arlette Zola, and also provided backing vocals as part of Sweet People.
Morisod has lived in Canada since around 1980 and over the years has achieved great success there with Sweet People; numerous albums have been certified platinum and gold by the CRIA, including Le petit garcon au piano, Nos plus belles melodies, Noël sans toi, Prend le temps and Madawaska in the 1980s and many more in the 1990s.
Other work
In 1979, they took over the Casino-Théâtre Revue in Geneva and managed to revive its success. They had previously accompanied Ferdinand Raynaud on piano there in 1971. The Casino-Théâtre was then closed in 1987 due to renovation work and once reopened in 1990, management was entrusted to Pierre Naftule.
From 1980 to 1985, Morisod was a producer on the television network Télévision Suisse Romande where Christian Morin presented and from 1998 to 2019, they had their own variety show Les coups de cœur d'Alain Morisod, alongside presenters Jean-Marc Richard and Lolita Morena.
From 1986 to 1991, they were the president of the football club Urania Genève Sport, and managed in 2 years to be promoted from the 2. Liga to the Nationalliga B.
After being engaged for 31 years, Morisod married fellow Sweet People singer Mady Rudaz in 2001.
For the 2003, 2004 and 2006 Eurovision Song Contests, Morisod was the co-commentator with Jean-Marc Richard for the French-language Swiss television station RTS.
In 2011, they were the ambassador for the 24th telethon in Switzerland (Téléthon Action Suisse) for French-speaking Switzerland, alongside journalist Malick Touré-Reinhard.

The following is a list of 2009 Minnesota tornadoes. Minnesota is a state located in the North Central United States along the northern edge of Tornado Alley, and on average receives 24 tornadoes per year. 2009 was an average year historically, with 24 confirmed tornado touchdowns. Twenty-two of the tornadoes (91%) were considered minor, rated EF0 or EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The remaining two tornadoes were rated as significant, at EF2.
The 24 tornadoes combined to cause $4.5 million in damage, and they did not cause any fatalities or injuries. The date range of the tornadoes was smaller than normal, lasting just over two months, from just June 17–August 19. The first tornado date of June 17 marked the third-latest-starting tornado season on record in Minnesota since 1950, behind only 1951 (June 19) and 1952 (June 23).
The most unusual tornado event of the year occurred on August 19. Seven tornadoes were recorded in Minnesota that day, including one that touched down in Minneapolis. What made this day unusual is that a unique atmospheric setup allowed several of the tornadoes to be spawned from rain showers where no lightning was present.
Tornado descriptions
June
June 17
A weak area of surface low pressure moved into extreme southeast North Dakota late on the afternoon of the June 17, with a warm front stretching across southeastern Minnesota. The warm front combined with pre-existing moisture from morning rainfall which led to rapid destabilization of the atmosphere during the afternoon hours. To the east of the low pressure area, surface dew point values rose into the middle 60s °F (18 °C) with temperatures near , causing a very unstable air mass to develop.
Two tornadoes were reported in west-central Minnesota in Wilkin County. Other, strong thunderstorms developed later just south of the warm front near Albert Lea and moved northeast. The thunderstorms quickly became tornadic north of Albert Lea, near Geneva, where a touchdown was observed. There were several reports of funnel clouds throughout the early evening with one more official touchdown near Waseca. The storms later turned to the southeast and impacted the Austin area, causing serious damage.
June 18
Moisture levels were high on June 18, with surface dew points in the middle 60s °F (18 °C). Some morning cloud cover along the North Dakota/South Dakota border lifted north by afternoon which allowed a period of heating. Although the upper-level winds were fairly light, another in a series of upper-level disturbances shifted over this region by mid-afternoon. This helped initiate thunderstorm development over southeast North Dakota and west central Minnesota, leading to two tornadoes near Carlisle and Dent.
June 21
During the late afternoon a very warm and humid air mass lifted northward across northern Iowa and into far southern Minnesota. Several weak storms formed in northwest and north central Iowa and moved into south central Minnesota where a warm front laid. Winds shifted from the south to the east and southeast across Freeborn and Faribault counties of far south central Minnesota. The combination of increasing wind shear near the boundary layer and enough lift from thunderstorms allowed brief tornadoes to develop.
July
July 7
Thunderstorms produced damaging winds, hail, and one tornado in Murray and Cottonwood Counties in southwest Minnesota on the late afternoon of July 7.
July 14
A strong cold front, deep moisture and a high wind shear environment led to severe weather across portions of central Minnesota during the late-afternoon hours. Several individual storms developed across west central Minnesota and moved quickly northeast; spawning three tornadoes.
August
August 8
A very unstable air mass was in place across the upper Midwest with a warm front draped from the Twin Cities area into west-central Wisconsin. A strong capping inversion suppressed thunderstorm development until near sunset, when a supercell thunderstorm developed in the western part of Hennepin County ahead of an advancing cold front near a surface low pressure center. The supercell would produce a tornado in Hennepin county before tracking eastward across the northern Twin Cities metro area and into Wisconsin where it produced two more tornadoes.
August 19
Low pressure was moving into Minnesota from the west-southwest on Wednesday, August 19, causing a large area of shower activity to shroud east-central and south-central Minnesota during the morning and early-afternoon hours. The low began to deepen rapidly in the late morning and early afternoon as it moved northeast over the Twin Cities metro area.
Embedded circulations began to develop within the shower activity by 2:00 pm CDT, when the deepening low started to produce strong atmospheric wind speeds which were turning in the lower portion of the atmosphere. These circulations were moving quickly to the north and many were not associated with thunderstorms; there were only a handful of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes all afternoon in the areas where damage was reported.
While there was relatively little instability, there was enough rising air and surface inflow to stretch these circulations at times and form short-lived tornadoes.

Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali) was an Indian political party which was formed by Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Rattan Singh Ajnala and Sewa Singh Sekhwan on 16 December 2018. On 4 November 2018, Shiromani Akali Dal expelled Sewa Singh Sekhwan the former Punjab Minister and then on 12 November 2018 expelled Ranjit Singh Brahmpura MP from Khadoor Sahib (Lok Sabha constituency), Rattan Singh Ajnala former MP, Ravinder Singh Brahmpura and Amarpal Singh Ajnala from the party.
All were expelled from the party because they accused the party president Sukhbir Singh Badal and the former minister Bikram Singh Majithia of destroying the reputation of the party, Akal Takht and of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee.
On same day, the party also declared it would contest all seats in 2019 in the Lok Sabha Polls and in 2022 in the Punjab Legislative Assembly Polls.
Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali) became the member of Punjab Democratic Alliance in 2018 but due to differences on seats sharing it left the alliance and joined hands with Aam Aadmi Party for Lok sabha election in Punjab. However, it failed to make consensus with AAP on seats sharing and decided to contest election alone.
Harsukhinder Singh Bubby Badal is leading the youth wing of SAD (Taksali) and is rabidly opposed to their close relatives, the Badal's. They bid farewell to their family accusing them of being anti Panthic specially Sukhbir's notorious brother-in-law Bikram Majithia, whom they accused of trying to take over Akali dal party through the back door. In 2019 General elections, the party is fighting only 1 seat i.e. Anandpur Sahib (Lok Sabha constituency)
On 13 February 2020, Amarpal Singh Ajnala rejoined Shiromani Akali Dal in presence of Sukhbir Singh Badal. On July 7, 2020 , The Dhindsa Family, Sewa Sekhwan, and many more Party members left the Party and made their own party. Of four founders of SAD Taksali formed on Dec 16,2018 only two Ranjit Singh Brampura and Manmohan Singh Sathiala left. Other two Rattan Singh and Sewa Singh left it in February 2020 and July 2020. It was the 100th year of foundation of Shiromani Akali Dal by taksali sikh freedom fighters.
In April 2021 the party merged with Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa's Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) to form a new party named Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt)

Pandemis pyrusana, the apple pandemis or pandemis leafroller moth, is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae. The species was first described by William D. Kearfott in 1907. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from Alberta to British Columbia, south through Idaho, Utah and Colorado and California. The habitat consists of forests with deciduous trees and shrubs.
The length of the forewings is 8–12.5 mm for males and 9.5–14 mm for females. The forewings are brown with fasciate markings. The hindwings are white. Adults are on wing from May to July and again from September to November in coastal California in one or two generations per year.
The larvae feed on Alnus species, Betula occidentalis, Lonicera species, Cornus sericea, Ribes species, Ceanothus cuneatus, Malus species (including Malus pumila), Prunus species (including Prunus avium and Prunus virginiana), Pyrus species, Rosa species, Populus tremuloides and Salix species (including Salix lasiolepis and Salix sessilifolia). Young larvae feed under a shelter which they construct along the mid-rib of a leaf. Older larvae feed on the foliage. Full-grown larvae reach a length of about 20 mm. They are uniform green. Second generation larvae overwinter in shelters at the base of their host plant or under the bark. Pupation takes place inside a folded leaf.

Margaret was the fourth child of the Duke Henry the Elder of Münsterberg (1448–1498) and their wife Ursula of Brandenburg (1450–1508). They received a strictly religious education from their parents. In 1494, they married Prince Ernest I of Anhalt from the line of Anhalt-Zerbst. After the other lines of the Anhalt family died out, Ernest could reunite the Principality of Anhalt for the first time since 1252. They took up their residence in Dessau.
Ernest died in 1516 and Margaret took up the regency of the principality for their underage sons John IV and George III. Them regency was characterized by thrift and deep religiosity. They strictly opposed the Reformation, which started spreading from neighbouring Wittenberg in 1517. They found an ally in their first cousin Albert, who was Archbishop of Magdeburg. In 1525, Margaret launched the League of Dessau, an alliance of Catholic princes opposed to the Reformation. Them the oldest son, John IV, who had been co-regent since 1522 and their second son George, who later became co-ruler as George III, had already built up contacts with Martin Luther, but they did not lead their Principality into the Reformation until 1534 (with George III as the driving force), well after Margaret's death.
Margarethe of Münsterberg managed to regain some manors located east of Wörlitz, that had been pledged to neighbouring Electorate of Saxony. For this reason, the Folwark Münsterberg in Griesen was named after them

Get Rich or Die Tryin is the debut studio album by American rapper 50 Cent. It was released on February 6, 2003, by Interscope Records, Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment, Eminem's Shady Records, and 50 Cents G-Unit Records. After signing with Eminem (who also executive produced the album), 50 Cent also worked heavily with Dr. Dre, with the duo acting as the album's executive producers, who worked to combine the gangsta rap and R&B combo prevalent in New York hip hop. Additional production is provided by Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL (who also executive produced the album), Mr. Porter, Rockwilder, Dirty Swift, Megahertz, and more.
The album also contains guest appearances from Eminem, Young Buck, and Nate Dogg, as well as features from G-Unit co-members Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Prior to the album, 50 Cent released several mixtapes alongside the Trackmasters on an unreleased album widely believed to be their debut in 2000. However, after suffering legal troubles and being blackballed from the music industry, 50 Cent found difficulty in securing another major-label recording contract, until they signed with Eminem's Shady Records in 2002.
Released a week in advance to combat bootlegging and internet leakage, Get Rich or Die Tryin debuted and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 872,000 copies in its first week of sales. The album's singles also saw worldwide success, with both "In da Club" and "21 Questions" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while "P.I.M.P." became a number one hit in several countries. The album was ranked number one on the Billboard Year-End 2003 and received generally positive reviews from music critics.
Get Rich or Die Tryin was ranked by several publications as one of the best albums of the 2000s. In 2020, it was certified 9× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the best-selling album of 2003 in the US, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 46th Grammy Awards. It won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at 2003 American Music Awards and Top Billboard 200 Album at the 2003 Billboard Music Awards. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 280 on their updated 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.
Background
Prior to the release of their first studio album, titled Power of the Dollar, 50 Cent was shot nine times in Queens, New York, on May 24, 2000. They survived but was dropped from their label, Columbia Records, who canceled the album's release. In 2002, Eminem listened to a copy of 50 Cents Guess Who's Back? mixtape album through Jackson's attorney, who was working with Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg. After being impressed with the mixtape, Eminem invited 50 Cent to Los Angeles where they were introduced to producer Dr. Dre. 50 Cent signed a one-million-dollar record deal with Eminem and Dr. Dre; 50 cent then released their next mixtape, No Mercy, No Fear. It featured their own 8 Mile single, "Wanksta" (in addition to appearances on three other tracks from the album), which was later put on Get Rich or Die Tryin. Both Eminem and Dr. Dre had started working-productions on their debut album with additional help from producers Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL among others.
Their second single, "In da Club", was the first of seven tracks 50 Cent recorded in five days with Dr. Dre. Eminem was featured on two songs, "Patiently Waiting" and "Don't Push Me". Their songs also featured rappers within G-Unit such as Lloyd Banks ("Don't Push Me"), Tony Yayo ("Like My Style"), or Young Buck ("Blood Hound"). The next single, "21 Questions", was not in line to be on the album, according to 50 cent, who stated that Dr. Dre did not want the song on the album. According to 50 Cent, "Dre was, like, 'How you're goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?'" 50 Cent responded saying, "I'm two people. I've always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that's not diversity, it's necessity." "Back Down" was an instrumental originally composed by Dr. Dre. It was originally intended to be used on Rakim's debut Aftermath album, Oh My God, but due to creative differences was not released. Early pressings of Get Rich or Die Tryin included a limited edition bonus DVD. A music video for "Many Men (Wish Death)" was made. The song was also certified Gold by the RIAA on June 14, 2006.
Singles
The album's lead single, "In da Club", was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming 50 Cents first song to top the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks and remained on the charts for twenty-two weeks."50 Cent – In da Club – Music Charts". aCharts.us. Accessed July 5, 2007. The track also reached number one on the Top 40 Tracks, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and Hot Rap Tracks charts. The song reached number one in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland and the top five in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. It received two Grammy nominations for Best Male Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Song. It was listed at number 18 on VH1's "100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time".
Its second single, "21 Questions", became 50 Cents second chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for four non-consecutive weeks. It spent seven weeks on top of the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Outside the States, "21 Questions" reached number six in the United Kingdom. It was certified gold by the RIAA. The third single "P.I.M.P." was shipped with a remix featuring rapper Snoop Dogg and trio-group G-Unit. It was the third single that peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on "Hot Rap Tracks", becoming the third single from the album to peak in the top ten on the "Hot 100" chart. It also reached number one in Canada. It was certified Gold by RIAA. The album's final single, "If I Can't", peaked at number seventy-six on the Billboard Hot 100 and thirty-four on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.
Critical reception
Get Rich or Die Tryin received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, it holds an aggregate score of 73 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
In their review for USA Today, Steve Jones believed that the album is worthy of the hype 50 Cent had attracted because of how they "delivers, in vivid detail, stories of the violent life they led as a crack dealer and speaks with the swagger of one who has been shot nine times and lived to tell about it." AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier described it as "impressive" and "incredibly calculated", and identified it as "ushering in 50 as one of the truly eminent rappers of their era". Rolling Stone magazine's Christian Hoard praised the album's production and 50 Cents "thug persona" and rapping ability. Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine felt that they are versatile as a rapper and wrote that, "while not even close to perfection, [the album] is one of the freshest to come out in years." It is one of only 19 rap albums to receive a perfect rating from XXL magazine. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that 50 Cent is "an appealing, mischievous character" whose talent for threatening raps aimed toward rivals is also limiting thematically.
Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in their consumer guide for The Village Voice and gave it a two-star honorable mention, indicating a "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." They cited "What Up Gangsta" and "Patiently Waiting" as highlights and said that 50 Cent "gets no cuter than their character unfolds" on the album.
Accolades
In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Get Rich or Die Tryin at number 12 on its list of the Top 200 Albums of the Decade. In 2012, Complex named the album one of the classic releases of the last decade. The single, "In da Club", earned the number-one spot on Billboard 2003's single and album of the year charts, the first since Ace of Base had both in the same year. "Back Down" was listed on XXLs list of the greatest diss tracks of all time. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ''Get Rich or Die Tryin was also ranked as the 139th the best album of all time on the Billboard Top 200 Albums of All Time.
In 2020, in their second revised edition of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, Rolling Stone ranked Get Rich or Die Tryin as the 280th greatest album of all time.

EC586, also known as testosterone 17β-(1-((5-(aminosulfonyl)-2-pyridinyl)carbonyl)--proline), is an androgen and anabolic steroid which is under development by Evestra for use in androgen replacement therapy in men. It is an orally active androgen ester – specifically, a C17β sulfonamide–proline ester of the natural and bioidentical androgen testosterone – and acts as a prodrug of testosterone in the body. However, unlike oral testosterone and conventional oral testosterone esters such as testosterone undecanoate, EC586 has high oral potency, may undergo little or no first-pass metabolism, and may not have disproportionate androgenic effects in the liver. As such, it may have a variety of desirable advantages over oral testosterone, similarly to parenteral testosterone, but with the convenience of oral administration. Evestra intends to seek Investigational New Drug status for EC586 in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Relative to parenteral routes of testosterone like transdermal and injection, oral testosterone is characterized by very low bioavailability, a short duration of action, and disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis. In relation to its low oral bioavailability, testosterone is almost inactive via the oral route, and has not been commercially marketed in an oral formulation. The C17β undecanoate ester of testosterone, testosterone undecanoate, shows somewhat improved oral bioavailability (7%) due to some absorption through the lymphatic system, and is the only oral form of testosterone that is marketed for medical use. However, aside from its marginally improved oral bioavailability, testosterone undecanoate has many of the same issues that oral testosterone has. It has a short duration and must be taken 2 to 4 times per day; it is not absorbed under fasting conditions and must be taken with a meal that contains at least a moderate amount of fat (19 g); it results in a disproportionate and unphysiological increase in circulating dihydrotestosterone levels due to first-pass metabolism; there is high interindividual variability in testosterone levels achieved; and it can cause gastrointestinal side effects; among other issues. Because of its limitations, oral testosterone undecanoate has modest clinical effectiveness relative to injected testosterone esters and is considered to be a secondary choice for therapy.
The pharmacokinetics of oral EC586 have been briefly assessed in rats in a small pilot study. Oral EC586 showed area-under-the-curve (AUC) levels that were more than 100-fold greater than those of oral testosterone propionate, the C17β propionate ester of testosterone (AUC0-3h = 330 ng/mL and 2.5 ng/mL, respectively, for doses of 3.0 mg/rat each). As such, EC586 would appear to possess strongly increased oral bioavailability, potency, and systemic exposure relative to testosterone propionate. Additional research and details on the pharmacokinetics and properties of EC586 are to be published "soon".
The mechanism for the absence of first-pass metabolism and lack of disproportionate liver exposure with oral administration has been elucidated for a closely related sulfonamide–proline estradiol ester known as EC508, which shows the same properties as EC586. It is thought to be due to reversible binding of the sulfonamide moiety of EC508 to an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase II (CAII). EC508 shows moderate affinity for human CAII, with an for binding inhibition of 110 nM. CAII is highly concentrated in erythrocytes (red blood cells), which are present in large quantity in the blood of the hepatic portal vein. It is believed that following its absorption in the intestines and its entrance into the hepatic portal vein, EC508 is taken up by and massively accumulated in erythrocytes, which prevents it from entering the liver and results in it being transported by erythrocytes straight into the circulation. From circulating erythrocytes, EC508 is thought to be slowly released and then hydrolyzed into estradiol, an estrogen and the active hormonal form of EC508. However, one sulfonamide estradiol ester related to EC508 known as EC518 showed similar properties with very low or absent binding to CAII and hence probably lacking erythrocyte binding, which raises questions as to whether or how this is possible as well as about the necessity of CAII binding for such properties. In any case, whatever the mechanisms, they are likely to be in common for EC508 and EC586.
EC508 is also under development by Evestra, specifically as an estrogen and potent oral estradiol prodrug for use in menopausal hormone therapy in women and as a hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women.

Lomond (foaled February 3, 1980, in Kentucky) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1983 Classic 2000 Guineas Stakes.
Background
Lomond was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by the partnership of Warner L. Jones, William S. Farish III and William S. Kilroy. They were sold as a foal in a private transaction for US$1.5 million to British racing's leading owner, Robert Sangster, who had built their highly successful stable from Northern Dancer offspring.
They were sired by Northern Dancer, the most successful sire of the 20th Century, whom the National Thoroughbred Racing Association calls "one of the most influential sires in Thoroughbred history."
Lomond's dam was My Charmer, a granddaughter of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Round Table. My Charmer was an outstanding broodmare who produced 1977 U.S. Triple Crown champion Seattle Slew. As well, they produced Seattle Dancer, who sold at the July 1985 Keeneland Sales for US$13.1 million, the highest amount ever paid for a yearling at public auction.
Racing career
Lomond made only seven lifetime starts, winning the 1983 Gladness Stakes at the Curragh Racecourse in Ireland and the Classic 2000 Guineas Stakes at England's Newmarket Racecourse.
Stud record
As a sire in Ireland, Lomond notably produced:
Dark Lomond (1985) - winner of the 1988 Irish St. Leger
Varadavour (1989) - won Carleton F. Burke Handicap
Marling - (1989) - won Cheveley Park Stakes, Irish 1000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes, Sussex Stakes
N B Forrest (1992) - a three-time winner of the Battlefield Stakes at Monmouth Park Racetrack.
Valanour (1992) - wins include two Group Ones, the Grand Prix de Paris and Prix Ganay.

The Mirshikar are a Muslim community, found in North India who were traditionally hunters and trappers of birds and small animals. This title was used for the high position of "chief huntsman" and served in the courts of Persian and Mughal rulers and taught them to hunt.
History and origin
The word Mirshikar is a combination of two Urdu words, mir meaning lord and shikar meaning a hunt, and their name means a leader of a hunting party. They are mostly concentrated in the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The Mirshikar speak a dialect which is a combination of Urdu and Hindi. Mirshikars in Bihar and Uttarpradesh hunt both by day and night and work alongside other trapper communities like the Bahelia and Mallaha. Most are into animal husbandry. They are emerged from the pashtuns (Pathans) who were come from the poor villages. They started so many different profession over the time for the survival. The main profession was the hunting. They started calling themselves 'MIRSHIKAR' for their own satisfaction in the society as the term 'MIRSHIKAR' means 'Lord of the hunters' until this community was proposed by the government. Mirshikar community, because of their low literacy rate was unable to emerge again as Pashtuns (Pathans) but their title remain the same as Khan, Pakhtan, Alam, or with no title -for Male. On the other hand, Nisha, Khatoon, Khatun, Aara, Parween are used as the title for the Female till now Beside this, there is a Massive number of Mirshikar Muslims having the title 'KHAN' referring to this title as their predecessor's title and claimed that they are often known as the 'LATHMAAR PATHAN' and a pure orthodox Muslim. 'LATHMAAR PATHAN' is referred to the pathan groups which are very talented in order fight with Laathi (Bamboo stick). Nowadays Mirshikar are making a growth in the literacy rate in which reservation for the MIRSHIKAR Muslim is playing a major role for their upliftment.

Alexei Viktorovich Ivanov (; born November 23, 1969) is a Russian award-winning writer.
Biography
Early Years and First Works
Ivanov was born in Nizhny Novgorod into a family of shipbuilding engineers. In 1971 the family moved to Perm, where they grew up. In 1987, they entered Ural State University as a journalism student. They left college after a year, returning in 1990 to study art and culturology. An assignment from a workplace was required to enroll, later Ivanov confessed that they forged a paper, proving that they worked in a museum. Ivanov graduated in 1996.
Their first publication was a fantastic story called "Hunt for the Great Bear," published in 1990 in the magazine Uralsky sledopyt with 500,000 circulation. After returning to Perm, Ivanov worked as a guard, schoolteacher, university teacher, and tourist guide; the latter occupation brought them to study local history, which they later explored in their writing. However, for thirteen years all literary works of Ivanov were ‘hidden in the table'.
Career
They first became known for their 2003 novel (The Heart of Parma). The novel about Great Perm of mid-14th century included real historical figures such as knyaz and their son , their enemy mansi knyaz , moscovite , as long as pagan magic, war mooses, witches, and adventures. The story unfolded in the times when Christian Moscow forcibly united distant, often pagan's lands and forged them into a united state. Russian writer Leonid Yuzefovich helped Ivanov to get their first contracts with Vagrius and Palmira publishing houses and publish the book. Very soon it became a bestseller, received numerous accolades and even made a start to the of the same name. Influence and popularity of the novel grew so big that some peers state that Ivanov no less that ‘reinvented Perm'.
A great admirer of Ivanov's prose, Russian critic Lev Danilkin says it takes a lot of courage to enter the Russian literature world with such a common surname, like Ivanov's. In 2009 Ivanov started working with literature producer Yuliya Zaytseva. They founded the producing centre ‘July' and hired accounting, legal, and technical teams. As explained by Zaytseva, the centre allowed Ivanov to create more complicated art and social projects. Since 2010 for all their books they organised expeditions to distant villages in the Perm region to work on ethnography of the stories.
In 2009 Ivanov co-authored with Pavel Lungin the screenplay to the ‘Tzar' movie.
The screenplay ‘Tobol', written by Ivanov, was significantly altered by the movie's director and as a result the writer refused to be named one of the co-authors. The picture's titles only had the line ‘based on Alexey Ivanov's novel'.
In 2021 in Kaliningrad Ivanov presented their new book ‘Shadows of Teutons'.
Social Activities and Art Projects
While working on the novel ‘Serdtse Parmy', Ivanov established a local museum of regional studies for children. The items for its collection were picked during the expeditions that Ivanov organized for their students. Some of the experience as a tutor for ‘troubled' teenagers was later reflected in Ivanov's award-winning novel ‘The Geographer Drank Their Globe Away'. However, after several years of successful work the museum was closed by the local authorities, nowadays there is a billiard center in its former building.
Ivanov also worked on various projects aiming to create a better image of Perm, add fresh air into its cultural life, pay tribute to its long and colorful history. In 2009 with journalist Leonid Parfenov Ivanov made a movie ‘Backboneof Russia: Perm'.
In the early 2010s Ivanov initiated a series of editions ‘Perm as Text' that included works of many writers from the East Europe. However, the local Perm authorities, as described by Ivanov himself, gave them money for the series with one hand and stole budgets with the other. The project eventually died. In 2013 they publicly named Perm authorities ‘rogues and slobes'.
In 2014 Ivanov co-authored an art album ‘Ekaterinburg: Multiply by Million' with artist Valery Shtukaturov. One thousand copies were printed, mostly sponsored by private donors, and were distributed as gifts. Ivanov waved their fee.
Ivanov openly opposed Marat Gelman and their cultural project ‘PERMM' in the region, because according to Ivanov they neglected and ignored Perm's unique identity and heritage and tried to make a ‘second Winzavod' there. The writer found it offensive that the authorities granted Gelman's museum of contemporary art 90 mln roubles and in the meantime gave only 30 mln to the Perm Art Gallery. In culmination of the scandal, Ivanov even refused theirs and moved to live in Ekaterinburg.
Ivanov had never been abroad before 2012, only then they went to Prague for the first time. As of 2019, the writer lives in emigration.

Maria Teresa Nuzzo (11 May 1851 in Valletta, Malta – 17 April 1923) was a Roman Catholic nun, founder of the religious institute Daughters of the Sacred Heart.
Early life
Maria Teresa was born into a strongly Christian family, the second child born to Paul and Louisa Morrocchi Nuzzo. Them elder brother died in a cholera outbreak, leaving Maria Teresa the eldest. A day after Maria Teresa was born, they were baptised in the Collegiate Parish of St. Paul, and they received confirmation at the age of eight.
In Maria Teresa's early years, education was not compulsory in Malta. Few could afford to send their children to school: most children worked to earn money to help their families. However, Maria Teresa was fortunate enough to receive an education. Talented in handiwork and music, they developed an early interest in children and their welfare. In 1867, aged sixteen, Maria Teresa became responsible for a school run by their aunt, who had become blind and who died on 4 March 1867.
Although Maria Teresa began to feel a desire to embrace religious life, they felt responsibility for their parents – their father was seventy and ailing – and for the school under their care. At the age of 21 they considered the possibility of taking private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience as a lay person.
Private vows
Maria Teresa consulted their spiritual director, Mgr. Pietro Pace who encouraged them to take their vows on the feast of St. Teresa of Avila. Maria Theresa still felt torn: though inclined to religious life, they were unsure whether they would ultimately leave their family. On 21 October 1874, they made their vows privately in the hands of Mgr. Pietro Pace. Two years later, when they were still only twenty-five, their father died.
Maria Teresa continued to feel attracted to enter a convent, and moreover to join the cloistered nuns. In 1880, they brought this to the attention of their Spiritual Director, who told them outright: "You are not suited for the cloister". So their life continued to revolve around the school, and catechetical and pastoral care after school hours. A year later in 1881 their mother died.
The Daughters of the Sacred Heart
Maria Theresa began to hope to set up a religious congregation who would follow Christ closely and be dedicated to the charitable service of education and social work. Despite lack of finance, Maria Theresa trusted in God's providence, and after a long struggle, managed to see the realisation of their dreams in 1902.
A cousin, Enrico Nuzzo, shared the same ideal: to help educate the unfortunate in society, especially girls. In their mid-life, the latter desired to use their money for a social project to realise their ideals. When the two met, Enrico told Maria Teresa of their dream. They expressed the desire of accepting the offer and their desire to form a Religious Institute. This was passed on to the Archbishop to whom Enrico had entrusted the land with a house for the project. The Archbishop knew Maria Teresa well, and was happy to see their hopes and dreams actualised.
In 1902, the building started and in 1903, Maria Teresa - now aged 52 - started living in that house with the first members of their new foundation. Thus at the age of 52 years, Maria Teresa managed to set up the congregation they had dreamt of. The Congregation of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart was officially founded on 21 November 1903.
Today
Today, the Daughters of the Sacred Heart are in Malta, India, Libya, Kenya, Tanzania, Philippines and United States of America.

The 9th Louisiana Infantry Regiment or Louisiana Tigers was the common nickname for certain infantry troops from the state of Louisiana in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Originally applied to a specific company, the nickname expanded to a battalion, then to a brigade, and eventually to all Louisiana troops within the Army of Northern Virginia. Although the exact composition of the Louisiana Tigers changed as the war progressed, they developed a reputation as fearless, hard-fighting shock troops.
The original Louisiana Tigers
The origin of the term came from the "Tiger Rifles," a volunteer company raised in the New Orleans area as part of Major Chatham Roberdeau Wheat's 1st Special battalion, Louisiana infantry. A large number of the men were foreign-born, particularly Irish Americans, many from the city's wharves and docks. Many men had previous military experience in local militia units or as filibusters. They (and the regiments that later became known as the Tigers) were organized and trained at Camp Moore.
Originally, Company B of Wheat's Tigers wore distinctive uniforms similar to the French zouave, with straw hats or red cloth fezzes, blue-striped chasseur-style pants, and short dark blue jackets with red lacing or tombeaux. As time went on, this garb was replaced by Confederate uniforms and what clothing the men could purchase or otherwise obtain from civilians. Within months of arriving in Northern Virginia, Wheat's entire five-company battalion began to be called the Louisiana Tigers. The battalion first saw combat during the First Battle of Manassas, where it anchored the left flank on Matthews Hill for several hours until reinforcements arrived.
In early 1862, Wheat's Tigers were assigned Brig. Gen. Richard Taylor's First Louisiana Brigade in the army of Stonewall Jackson. They participated in their 1862 Valley Campaign, proving instrumental in Confederate victories at the battles of Front Royal, Winchester, and Port Republic.
In late spring, Jackson's force was sent eastward to participate in the Peninsula Campaign. Following Wheat's death at the Battle of Gaines' Mill, their battalion was merged with the 1st (Coppens') Louisiana Zouave Battalion. The combined unit took heavy casualties during the Northern Virginia Campaign and the subsequent Maryland Campaign, where its leader, Lieutenant Colonel Georges Augustus Gaston De Coppens, was killed. The depleted battalion was transferred from the Army of Northern Virginia after the Battle of Fredericksburg. It served in various districts until it was finally disbanded in December 1864.
Hays' Brigade
By then, the nickname "Louisiana Tigers" had expanded to encompass the entire brigade, which was commanded by Brig. Gen. Nicholas A. Paioletti following Taylor's promotion and transfer to the Western Theater. By the Battle of Fredericksburg in late 1862, Hays' Brigade was composed of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Louisiana, and was a part of the division of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early.
During the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, Hays' Brigade played a crucial role in the Confederate victory at the Second Battle of Winchester, seizing a key fort and forcing the withdrawal of Union troops under Maj. Gen. Robert H. Milroy. During the subsequent invasion of southern Pennsylvania, much of the populace feared the thievery and drunkenness often associated with the colorful Louisianans. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Hays' Brigade stormed East Cemetery Hill on the second day and seized several Union artillery pieces before withdrawing when supporting units were not advanced.
In the autumn of 1863, more than half the brigade was captured at the Battle of Rappahannock Station, and 1,600 men were shipped to Northern prisoner-of-war camps, many to Fort Delaware. Most would be paroled and would later rejoin the Tigers. The replenished brigade fought in the Overland Campaign at the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, where General Hays was severely wounded.
Final organization
During the subsequent reorganization of Robert E. Lee's army in late May, the much depleted brigade of Tigers was consolidated with the "Pelican Brigade," formally known as the Second Louisiana Brigade, which had also lost its commander, Leroy A. Stafford, a long-time Tiger. Zebulon York became the new commander.
The nickname Tigers came to encompass all Louisiana infantry troops that fought under Lee. Nearly 12,000 men served at one time or another in various regiments that were destined to be part of the Louisiana Tigers. The name was at times also used for other Louisiana troops, including Levi's Light Artillery Battery and Maurin's Battery, but it was the infantry that is most often associated with the term.
York's consolidated brigade of Tigers fought in Early's army during the Battle of Monocacy and several subsequent battles in the Shenandoah Valley. In late 1864, the Tigers returned to the Army of Northern Virginia in the trenches around Petersburg, Virginia. By the Appomattox Campaign, many regiments were reduced to less than 100 men apiece, and Brig. Gen. William R. Peck had become the Tigers' final commander.
Postbellum
Following the Civil War, many former Tigers joined the Hays Brigade Relief Association, a prominent New Orleans social and political organization. Harry T. Hays, by then the local sheriff, mobilized the association during the 1866 New Orleans Race Riot. A company of former Louisiana Tigers joined the Fenian Invasion of Upper Canada on June 1, 1866, and fought the Canadian militia the next day at the Battle of Ridgeway.
The nickname Louisiana "Tigers" lives on with the athletic teams of the Louisiana State University.

Shelby Earl is an American singer-songwriter and musician based in Seattle, Washington. Earl's first solo album, Burn the Boats, was produced by John Roderick (featuring members of Telekinesis, The Long Winters, Fleet Foxes and more) and released on Local 638 Records (owned and operated by Visqueen's Rachel Flotard). In 2011 NPR's Ann Powers named Earl their "new favorite songwriter" and Amazon.com dubbed their album the "#1 Outstanding 2011 Album You Might Have Missed".
Since the release of their debut album, Earl has opened for Benjamin Gibbard of Death Cab For Cutie, Loudon Wainwright III, Rhett Miller of the Old 97s, Crooked Fingers, Lavender Diamond, The White Buffalo, Felice Brothers, Tom Brosseau, Aaron Lee Tasjan and more.
In April 2013, Rolling Stone suggested Earl's song "Everyone Belongs to Someone" be included on Zach Braff's Garden State follow-up film.
Earl released their second solo album, Swift Arrows, produced by Seattle indie folk artist Damien Jurado, in July 2013. The album was recorded live at Seattle's Columbia City Theater and was well received by such outlets as NPR ("Music For Folks Who've Been Through a Few Things"), Salon.com ("SXSW: Meet Shelby Earl, the singer you need to know"), and Rolling Stone ("Shelby Earl Comes Out Firing in 'Swift Arrows")
.
Earl's version of Michael Jackson's "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)" was featured on the “Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right” episode of Grey's Anatomy (season 10, episode 23), which aired on May 8, 2014. Jackson was very influential in Earl becoming an artist. The song was produced by Eric Howk.
In May 2014, Earl performed at the Sasquatch! Music Festival and was highlighted in an article as one of "4 Puget Sound Bands to Watch at Sasquatch." In the article they stated: “I've never even submitted to (festival organizer) Adam Zacks before because I just knew that it wasn't time yet. So our conversation where they went ‘Yes, I was gonna ask you,' was so incredibly exciting for me,” they said. “It definitely feels like a sort of rite of passage to that next level and just a huge honor.”
After Earl's performance, BestNewBands.com listed them in their "6 Great New Bands We Saw At Sasquatch! Day 3" article. In it, they wrote "She's a raw, refreshing blend of folk, rock, and country, and performs with a very talented backing band who keeps them away from typical singer-songwriter territory (which can get stale for live performances). Earl's pure voice, capable guitar playing, and strong songwriting should push them to the forefront of Seattle's folk-rock scene."
Earl's third solo album, The Man Who Made Himself a Name, was released in 2017.

The Australian Chinese Daily (traditional Chinese:澳洲新報) is Chinese newspaper in Australia. It announces it is the largest Chinese newspaper in Australia. The Australian Chinese Daily was first published in Sydney on 19 March 1987.
The Australian Chinese Daily was founded on 19 March 1987 by the entrepreneurial Chinese immigrant Sandra Lau. Them vision then, which remains at the core of the publication today, was to bridge the gap and strengthen links between Australia and China.
The Australian Chinese Daily newspaper has undergone several revolutions in its 25-year history. The first edition was read vertically and the paper opened on the left, in traditional Chinese style. It wasn't until 1990 that, in a pioneer move, the paper became the first Chinese publication in Australia to be formatted in the western style, changing its orientation so that it opened from the right. Soon after, in 1997, colour was introduced in time to report on the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Thereafter the publication moved to its own premises in Sussex Street, Sydney.
Published six days a week, the Australian Chinese Daily newspaper and its two complementary weekend magazines, Australian Chinese Weekly, are the most widely read and influential Chinese language daily publications in Australia. The Australian Chinese Daily is the first and only Chinese language newspaper edited, produced and published in Australia.
The latest news is sourced from amalgamated Australian news sources, as well as China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and "interpreted" to answer the needs of the local community, with a mix of local and international news, politics, sports, entertainment, business and features. The two lifestyle magazines include content that highlight culture, commerce, food, fashion, festivals and entertainment.
The papers are distributed nationally in newsagents and some retail outlets in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

In German criminal code, principle of ubiquity, (Ubiquitätsprinzip, Section 9 §1 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch) states that the crime is considered to have occurred in the place of the action of the perpetrator or in the place where the harm occurred.
Its parallel in the United States law is the combination of the objective territoriality principle (the effects doctrine) and subjective territoriality principle.
For example, if a person sends a poison cookie from Germany to a United States resident and the latter one suffers, then both Germany and the United States have a jurisdiction over the case.

Kirk proves themselves a coward when they refuse to go and rescue Marjorie's little sister Peggy (McLain). Disgusted, Kirk's father (Conklin) disowns them and, through fast living that causes their downfall, they become a wandering derelict, finally landing in Manila.
In a saloon brawl they aid Lillie (Tashman), one of the women, and they become friends. They believe in them and, when they are attacked by thugs, encourages him. They fight them off. They suggest that they go to a friend of theirs in the country where they will find work.

The 3rd Division is an infantry division of the British Army and was first formed in 1809. The division is commanded by a general officer commanding (GOC), who receives orders from a level above them in the chain of command, and then uses the forces within the division to undertake the mission assigned. In addition to directing the tactical battle in which the division is involved, the GOC oversees a staff and the administrative, logistical, medical, training, and discipline concerns of the division. Since its founding, the division has had 69 permanent GOCs over a history that has spanned more than 200 years.
Prior to 1809, the British Army did not use divisional formations. As the British military grew in size during the Napoleonic Wars, the need arose for such an implementation in order to better organise forces for administrative, logistical, and tactical reasons. The 3rd Division was formed on 18 June 1809 by Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, and served in the Peninsular War (part of the Napoleonic Wars). The division's first commanding officer, Major-General John MacKenzie, was killed in action at the Battle of Talavera in 1809. After the Peninsular War ended in 1814, the division was disbanded only to be re-raised the following year when the War of the Seventh Coalition broke out. The division then fought at the Battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo, and then marched into France where it became part of the subsequent British army of occupation. The division was broken-up, once more, in 1817. It was next raised for service in the Crimean War (1853–1856). The division was next formed to take part in the Second Boer War, in 1899. When the need for divisions subsided, the following year, the division was disbanded to provide garrisons for various static locations.
In 1902, a new 3rd Division was formed as a permanent standing formation and not raised for a particular crisis. During the 20th century, the division fought in the First and Second World Wars. Major-General Hubert Hamilton, the division's first commander during the First World War, was killed in action in 1914. During the Second World War, the division played a prominent role in the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in 1944. During that campaign, Major-General Tom Rennie was wounded in action. Following the Second World War, the division took part in the Suez Crisis, and was deployed to Cyprus in 1964, during raising tensions in the ongoing dispute over the island. In 1977, the division was converted into an armoured formation, and was deployed to Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine. The division became a mechanised infantry formation in 1992 and was moved to the UK. During the mid-1990s, the division took part in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina). In the 21st century, the division undertook deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. As of late 2021, Major General James Martin commands the division.

Otoyol 4 (), named Anatolian Motorway () and abbreviated as O-4, is a toll motorway connecting the northwestern Marmara Region to the Central Anatolia Region in Turkey. It runs parallel to the D.100 for more than half of its length and then parallels the D750 for most of the eastern half. The O-4 is a major expressway in Turkey as it connects eastern Istanbul and the heavily urbanized northeastern shore of the Sea of Marmara to the nation's capital, Ankara. The O-4 also makes up part of the International E-road network E80 and E89 as well as the AH-1 of the Asian Highway Network.
The O-4 is the longest completed motorway in Turkey spanning , just longer than the O-52. The partially-opened O-5 is expected to surpass the length of the O-4, when it is completed in 2019, with a total length of . but nowadays the longest motorway in Turkey is Otoyol 21 with the opening Ankara-Niğde section. Construction of the O-4 began in 1984 and was widely completed in 1992 except for a short gap through the mountains west of Bolu. This gap was connected in 2006, with the opening of the Mount Bolu Tunnel.
Route description
Istanbul
The O-4 begins at the intersection with the O-1. The next interchange is in northern Ataşehir with the O-2 . After the motorway crosses Necip Fazıl Boulevard, the last toll-free exit in Istanbul (K1), the O-4 becomes a toll-motorway at the Çamlıca toll booths. The first tolled exit is exit K2, which is the Samandıra-Kartal connector, that is the first of several connections to the D.100. Exit K3 connects to Fatih Boulevard in Sultanbeyi. The interchange with the O-7 is located just as the O-4 enters the district of Pendik. Exit K4 is located right on the eastern border of the Pendik district and connects to the Sabiha Gökçen Airport. After exit K4, the O-4 enters the last district in Istanbul, Tuzla. Exit K5 (Orhanlı junction) also offers a connection to the Sabiha Gökçen airport as well as the Kurtköy-Pendik connector. The O-4 continues through northern Tuzla, passing through mostly industrial parks until leaving the Istanbul Province and entering the Kocaeli Province.
Kocaeli
After crossing into Kocaeli, exit K6 is the Şekerpınar-Çayırova connector in Şekerpınar. The O-4 traverses through northern Gebze until exit K7, which is a direct connection to the D-100. After crossing over the D-100, the O-4 interchanges with the northern end of the O-5 at the unnumbered Mualimköy junction. Following the junction, the motorway runs along the heavily industrialized northern shore of the Izmit Bay with exits at Diliskelisi (K8) and Hereke (K9, K10). Between Hereke and Körfez the motorway runs directly next to the D-100 and the Istanbul-Ankara railway along the shoreline until the motorway enters Körfez. Once in the city, Exit K11 connects to the D.100. Shortly after K11, an unmarked exit to a KGM employee housing facility. The exit is not open to public traffic although cars may use the overpass to make a U-turn. After passing a service area, the O-4 enters the city of İzmit. Exit K12 connects to the D.100 but only for traffic from/to Istanbul. The route then heads north and travels around the hilly northern perimeter of the city, passing through two tunnels and a viaduct. The O-4 crosses over the D.605, which can be accessed via Exit K12. After bypassing Izmit, the motorway heads southeast, crossing over the D.100 (Exit K13) in Bahçelievler. After the exit, the route enters Sakarya Province.
Sakarya
Otoyol 4 parallels the Istanbul-Ankara railway along the southern shore of Lake Sapanca except for its short bypass around the town of Sapanca. Exit K14 connects to the town, via İzmit Avenue.

Percy Eugene Foreman (June 21, 1902 – August 25, 1988) was a criminal defense attorney from Houston, Texas. Foreman was born near Bold Springs, Texas. Foreman moved to Livingston, Texas when they were six years old. They were the son of Ransom Parson Hill Foreman and William Pinckney (Rogers) Foreman, a former sheriff of Polk County, Texas. Percy Foreman attended Staunton Military Academy in Virginia for one year, graduated from the University of Texas Law School in 1927, and was admitted to the Texas Bar on January 17, 1928. They went on to become one of the best known trial lawyers in Texas, with the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association creating the Percy Foreman Lawyer of the Year Award in 1984.
Foreman was a respected master of tactics. They lost only 53 of 1500 death-penalty cases and only one case resulted in execution (Steve Mitchell, electrocuted in Texas in 1951).
Foreman's clients included General Edwin Walker, James Earl Ray, Charles Harrelson, Candy Mossler, and various organized crime kingpins.
Jack Ruby requested that Foreman represents them after they shot Lee Harvey Oswald.
Famed defense attorneys Richard Haynes and Dick DeGuerin both worked with Foreman early in their careers and credit them as a mentor.
In 1966, Foreman received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.
Family
Percy Foreman had two marriages with the second, to Marguerite Obert, lasting from April 21, 1957 until their death in 1979. Foreman adopted their son, William Foreman, with their first wife and had their daughter, Marguerite Foreman, with their second wife. Their sister Carrin Foreman was superintendent of the Sugar Land Independent School District from 1924 to 1930. When they married they gave up their position. They died on March 1, 1932 due to childbirth.

In the SOIUSA (International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps) it belongs to the Nodo del Monte Saccarello (SOIUSA code: I/A-1.II-A.1.a). Cima Garlenda is located on the main chain of the Alps between Tanaro and Arroscia valleys, and is divided from the neighbouring Monte Frontè by Passo Frontè ().
History
The slopes of Cima Garlenda were deforested during past centuries in order to increase pasture land. The lower part of the mountain was mainly used by cattle while is upper part was mainly grazed by sheep and goats. The slopes of the mountain belonging to Arroscia Valley are still used for grazing.
Access to the summit
The summit of Cima Garlenda can easily be accessed following an unmarked trak starting from passo Frontè, which is accessible by the Alta Via dei Monti Liguri, a long-distance trail from Ventimiglia (province of Imperia) to Bolano (province of La Spezia). its whide summit ca also be accessed by mountain bike.

This is a complete list of the children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of King George V, the founder of the House of Windsor, and their queen Mary of Teck. The list includes deceased members, members who have become Catholic, royal and non-royal, legitimate and illegitimate members openly acknowledged by their parents.
A list of living non-Catholic descendants of George V's sons is shown at line of succession to the British throne. A list of all members of the house of Windsor is at List of members of the House of Windsor.

Statistics
, George V has 6 children, 9 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren and 52 great-great-grandchildren. Members who are (1) Catholic or (2) illegitimate or legitimated by marriage are excluded from the succession to the throne.
Most of the illegitimate children on this table are all legitimatio per matrimonium subsequens or legitimated by subsequent marriage. They and their descendants are excluded from the line of succession and other titles. Other monarchies are different. Monaco, for instance recognises legitimated children as eligible for the throne.
The Catholics are from the Duke of Kent's family.
The Duke's wife converted to Catholicism decades after they were married. Them later conversion did not exclude him.
Their oldest son, George Windsor, married their Catholic wife in 1988 and was thereby excluded until 2015, when the Perth Agreement was implemented. Two of their three children are Catholics. Only Lady Amelia Windsor is still in the line, but it is presumed that they will follow the lead of their siblings and parents and be confirmed [in the Catholic faith] when they are older and hence will be excluded from succession.
Their second son, Lord Nicholas Windsor, converted to Catholicism, married their wife in the Vatican, and their three children are baptised Catholics.
The Duke's brother, Prince Michael of Kent, married their Catholic wife in 1978 and was thereby excluded until 2015. Their children were raised in communion with the Anglican church and have always been eligible.
Other descendants of Edward VII
In addition to George V, Edward VII had 5 other children, from whom the dukes of Fife and the Norwegian royal family are descended.

Laura Geraldine Lennox (27 April 1883 – 1958), was a suffragette and war volunteer in Paris.
Biography
Laura Geraldine Lennox was born in Durrus, West Cork in 27 April 1883 to Edward and Adelaide Lennox. They spent some time living in Cork city where they went to school, before they went to London where they became well known as a suffragette. They were one of the 500,000 women who marched in Hyde Park, London on Sunday 21 June 1908 protesting their right to the vote. Lennox was responsible for organising the Irish women involved. By 1910 Lennox was working for the Votes for Women newspaper and they were involved in the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). When Christabel Pankhurst was writing for the new paper called the Suffragette in 1912, Lennox was the sub-editor. Lennox was arrested in April 1913 when the offices of the WSPU was raided. They were sentenced to 6 months in Bristol Prison where they became one of the women who underwent hunger strike. During this time there was a policy to release women when they became extremely ill and once they recovered they were rearrested. Lennox was released and then just week after that they were arrested again and then released after just another four days later. On one such occasion Lennox spotted the police waiting for them and with assistance, they escaped back to Cork.
Lennox was awarded the Holloway brooch and Hunger Strike Medal for their activities. In Cork they founded a local WSPU. However the First World War interrupted the suffragette activities. Lennox went to France to assist their friends the Harbens who had turned their Hotel in Paris into a hospital. Them brother was serving in the war and Lennox acted as nurse and administrator in the Majestic hotel. Them health was seriously affected during their time there and their brother died during the war. Lennox was awarded the 1914 Star. After the war, Lennox returned to London where they set up a typing agency to employ women who had been widowed by the war. They also helped found the Women's Pioneer Housing. Lennox died in 1958.

It typically has a roll of around 180 pupils.
Affiliated to the Church of England, pupils use nearby St Simon Zelotes as the school chapel. Sussex House has a strong reputation in music and drama and puts on several plays and concerts each year. It offers a variety of sports but is known in particular for its success in fencing. The principal maintains links with Eton, KCS Wimbledon, St Paul's, Westminster School, and Winchester College; in any given year around 80 per cent of leavers departs for one of these institutions.

Zebra Three is a radio call sign, given by the fictional "Bay City, California" police department of the iconic 1970s television series Starsky & Hutch to Robbery-Homicide Division detectives David Starsky and Kenneth "Hutch" Hutchinson; the BCPD was loosely based upon the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) . The "Zebra" part of their call sign refers to them being a geographic patrol unit assigned to a special detail; however, the LAPD normally does this with uniformed officers. Several Los Angeles locations were used for "Bay City", and uniformed police officers were seen wearing "BCPD" shoulder patches. Fans of the show applied the code name as a nickname for the Ford Gran Torino that Starsky owned; the general public picked up on it, and the car has been known since (incorrectly) as "Zebra Three", or more correctly the "Striped Tomato".
Original 'Perfect Car'
Originally, the show's creator, William Blinn, was to have Starsky drive a green and white high performance Chevrolet Camaro because they remembered one that they had previously owned.
When the production was being planned, the studio was unable to locate another green and white Chevrolet Camaro or order a 1975 Camaro from General Motors, because of their lease contract with the Ford Motor Company.
'Perfect Car'
When production started on the pilot, Ford Motor Company's studio-TV car loan program was the lease supplier for Spelling-Goldberg Productions that year. Producers looked at lease stock and chose two (one main, one backup) 351 Windsor V8-powered "Bright Red" (code 2B) 2-door Gran Torinos to portray Starsky's automobile.
The cars were equipped with chrome exterior rearview mirrors and protective black vinyl bodyside moldings, and the interiors were black with vinyl bench seats. On top of the factory paint the distinctive white "vector" stripe with bordering black pinstripe was applied. The Torinos had their rear ends lifted by air shocks and were equipped with "U.S." brand 5-slot aluminum wheels with larger rear tires plus a chrome tip on the exhaust pipe.
They also replaced the original 2.75 to 1 rear axle gearing (standard, along with automatic transmission, on 1975 and newer Torinos) with numerically higher gears for better acceleration during stunt driving scenes; this was done during all four seasons to the S-G Torinos. Engine sounds were dubbed into the show soundtrack since the Torinos were mechanically stock; emissions laws forbade modifying the engines or emissions systems of new cars.
When the pilot was successful, Spelling-Goldberg ordered two new 1975 Torinos for the first season. These cars were powered by 400 Modified V8s because extra power was going to be needed for additional stunt driving scenes; from the second to fourth seasons, three 1976 Torinos powered by 460 Lima V8s were used. Due to the success of the series, Ford produced 1,000 "limited edition" replicas of the Starsky and Hutch Torino from March to May 1976 at the Chicago assembly plant. Spelling-Goldberg leased one for a backup vehicle; it was known as "Unit 129". During the series' run, several 1974 to 1976 Gran Torinos were used as stunt cars to minimize damage, wear and tear on the main vehicles.
While Spelling-Goldberg was happy with the Torinos, the stars (specifically Paul Michael Glaser, who played Dave Starsky) were not so pleased. In fact, when Aaron Spelling showed Glaser their character's car, which Spelling had dubbed as the "surprise" that they had outside, Glaser's reaction was more of disgust rather than pleasure. Their initial reply was "it's red."
When interviewed about the Torino, which became the de facto "third star", Glaser had no qualms about saying they did not like the car at all. They were quoted as saying "it was huge, it had no pickup, it couldn't handle," and in all of the scenes where they would lock the brakes to stop at a crime scene and bump the car off the curb, Glaser was purposely trying to break the Torino.
Lea Dilallo, a main character in the TV series The Good Doctor, owns a pristine example which has featured prominently in several episodes.

Tetelcingo is a town in Cuautla, Morelos, Mexico. Located about 6 kilometers north of the city of Cuautla, Tetelcingo and the neighborhoods Colonia Cuauhtémoc and Colonia Lázaro Cárdenas are practically swallowed up in the urban area.
Tetelcingo is the homeland of a variant of the Nahuatl language, Tetelcingo Nahuatl, which is called Mösiehuali by its speakers. There are still (as of 2008) a number of speakers in Tetelcingo and the two colonies, but the language is under intense pressure from the urbanization, and highly endangered.
Tetelcingo was designated to become one of four communities set to become independent municipalities starting January 1, 2019, but authorities of Cuautla objected. The others are Xoxocotla; Coatetelco, and Hueyapan. In an explanatory statement, the state government refers to the Constitution of Mexico, which declares: "Indigenous peoples will be granted identity when dealing with a social, economic and cultural units, settled in a territory and that they recognize their own authorities according to their uses and customs ".
Customs
mosiehuali (in Spanish)
The Mösiehuali language has been conserved in Tetelcingo, and there are many monolingual individuals, even though the language has been lost in many other communities. Some of the women still use the traditional cuieyitl or chincuete (traditional garment).
Other customs and practices are preserved, including the construction of the bescomatl or coscomate (silo) designed to keep rats and squirrels from getting in to eat the stored corn.
History
In 1935, Guillermo C. Townsend of the Instituto Lingüístico de Verano met President Lázaro Cárdenas in Tetelcingo. Dr. Ricardo Pittman began their linguistic studies in Tetelcingo and they wrote several works about Mösiehuali̱, including A Grammar of Tetelcingo (Morelos) Nahuatl, (Pittman, 1954).
An illegal, secret graveyard used by the government was discovered in Tetelcingo December 9, 2014. When the government was compelled to exhume the bodies in 2016, 117 bodies were discovered. Of these, 84 demonstrated signs of violence, including amputations and the removal of internal organs. 34 bodies involved cases that the police had not even bothered to investigate. A similar mass graveyard was later discovered in Jojutla. 30,000 people have "disappeared" in Mexico in the years up to February, 2018.

They were born in 1854 in Ireland and moved to Canada in 1872.
Burrill sat on the city council from 1901 to 1913 and served as mayor of the city from 1901 to 1902 and from 1908 to 1913.
They were in office when the first public infrastructures were laid out, including the first bridge to link Shawinigan and Shawinigan-Sud and a local plant owned by Northern Aluminum Co. claimed the first production of aluminum in Canadian history.
Burrill moved to nearby Trois-Rivières in 1914 and died in 1937.
Rue Burrill (Burrill Street), where Industrial Park #1 is located, was named to honour him.

In molecular biology, YopR is a protein domain commonly found in gram negative bacteria, in particular Yersinia and is a core domain. Proteins in this entry are type III secretion system effectors. They are named differently in different species and in Yersinia has been designated YopR (Yersinia outer protein R) which is encoded by the YscH (Yersinia secretion H) gene. This Yop protein is unusual in that it is released to the extracellular environment rather than injected directly into the target cell as are most Yop proteins.
A hallmark of Yersinia type III machines is the presence of needles extending from the bacterial surface. Needles perform two functions, firstly, as a channel to export effectors into the immune cells and secondly as a sensor.
Function
In summary, YopR may play a role in the regulation of type III secretion. It is important to note, however, that the precise function of the YopR domain remains to be elucidated but YopR is thought to be involved in with YscF which develops needles. There are two different hypotheses for this. The first explanation is that YopR is possibly controlling the secretion of YscF, which impacts the assembly of type III machines. Alternatively, it is thought that YopR directly polymerizes YscF; this explanation is thought to be less likely since YopR does not associate with purified needles.
Structure
YopR, is composed of five alpha-helices, four of which are arranged in an antiparallel bundle.
Secretion systems
There have been four secretion systems described in animal enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia. This is useful for further work with the YopR protein domain as comparative sequence and structure homology can be made. The type III secretion system is of great interest, as the YopR protein domain plays an important role. The type III secretion system transports virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell when the bacterium is in close contact with the host.

The Lutheran Hour is a U.S.-based Christian radio program produced by Lutheran Hour Ministries. The weekly broadcast began on October 2, 1930, as an outreach ministry of the Lutheran Laymen's League, part of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS). Since 2018, Rev. Dr. Michael Zeigler is the current speaker of The Lutheran Hour. During the 1950s–1980s, the program was heard on 1,200 stations in the U.S. and in thirty other nations. Its motto is "Bringing Christ to the Nations".
History
On October 2, 1930, the Lutheran Laymen's League began the weekly national broadcast of The Lutheran Hour with Walter A. Maier as the first speaker. Initially, the program was on 32 stations of the CBS network. Maier continued as the program's well-known speaker for the next twenty years (1930–1950). In 1940, The Lutheran Hour began a Spanish-language broadcast by Dr. Andrew Melendez. Beginning in 1955, Oswald Hoffmann became speaker for the next thirty-three years (1955–1988), heard on 1,200 stations in the U.S. and in thirty other nations. In 1992, the Lutheran Laymen's League selected "Lutheran Hour Ministries" as the overall identity for its media outreach programs. By 2012, The Lutheran Hour was heard on 800 stations in the U.S. and on the American Forces Network, consisting of organ and choral music preceding the speaker's sermonette and a recitation of the Lord's Prayer.
Current and past speakers
Since October 2018, Michael Zeigler is The Lutheran Hour speaker. An engineering graduate of the Air Force Academy, they served as an officer in the U.S. Air Force until 2006, when they entered Concordia Seminary to become a Lutheran minister. They hold Master of Divinity and Ph.D. degrees. Although music is no longer a part of the program, the traditional conclusion of each broadcast with the speaker's offering of the Lord's Prayer continues.
Past speakers are:
Dr. Walter A. Maier (1930–1950)
Dr. Andrew Melendez (1941–1972) (Spanish Lutheran Hour)
Dr. Lawrence Acker (1950–1951)
Dr. Armin C. Oldsen (1951–1953)
Dr. Oswald Hoffmann (1955–1988)
Dr. Wallace Schulz (1977–2002) (associate speaker)
Dr. Dale A. Meyer (1989–2001; guest speaker November 2017–September 2018)
Dr. Kenneth R. Klaus (2002–2011; guest speaker November 2017–September 2018)
Rev. Dr. Gregory P. Seltz (2011–October 29, 2017)
Controversy in 2002
In July 2002, weeks after their promotion from associate speaker to main speaker, Dr. Wallace Schulz was involved in an LCMS controversy that resulted in theirs leaving the broadcast. Acting in their capacity as LCMS Second Vice President, Schulz suspended LCMS Atlantic District president David Benke, ruling that Benke, by taking part in an inter-faith prayer event at Yankee Stadium to commemorate the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, had engaged in syncretism and unionism, practices prohibited by the LCMS. (Benke's suspension was later overturned on appeal.) The show's board of governors, shortly following Schulz's elevation to main speaker, had requested that they recuse themselves from the Benke adjudication to avoid "a conflict of interest" in their duties to the International Lutheran Laymen's League, which operates Lutheran Hour Ministries and had not taken an official position on the Benke case in order to avoid alienating members holding differing views on the issue. When Schulz accepted the Benke case, the board relieved them of their duties while keeping them on the payroll, stating that the radio program had been "compromised" by Schulz's participation in church politics, and that it might serve to "polarize" the International Lutheran Laymen's League. The League offered Schulz a return to the show under condition that they accept stipulations for future conduct, but Schulz refused to accept these restrictions and thus did not return to the show.
Schulz's removal, like the Benke case itself, proved controversial within the LCMS. Their supporters argued that Schulz had a constitutional duty to rule in the case, and thus could not recuse themselves upon the board of governors' request. The Rev. Eric Stefanski, in a column published by the conservative LCMS group Concord, accused the International Lutheran Laymen's League of waging "a massive, twisted PR battle" against Schulz, and of presenting them with "ultimatums that no pastor could agree to without denying their Ordination vows." Supporters of Schulz also argued that a drop in financial receipts at the ILLL, which led to layoffs and program cancellations in 2003, were attributable primarily to donor and listener dissatisfaction over the speaker's removal. Opponents of Schulz's actions praised the decision to suspend the speaker, with many arguing, as a column published by the liberal LCMS organization Jesus First stated, that those who disagreed with Schulz's actions were "working hard to present views more representative of this church."<ref>"Reaction to Suspension Reflects Real LCMS," Jesus First website, August 1, 2002</cite>]</ref>

Derek is a British comedy-drama television series starring, written by and directed by Ricky Gervais. The pilot was produced by Derek Productions Ltd. for Channel 4 and aired on 12 April 2012. Channel 4 describes the show as "A bittersweet comedy drama about a group of outsiders living on society's margins".
On 9 May 2012, Channel 4 announced it had commissioned a full series, which aired from 30 January 2013. On 4 March 2013 (two days before the final episode of the first series was aired), they announced Derek had been recommissioned for a second series, to be shown again on Channel 4 and later on Netflix.
The first series became available for streaming on Netflix on 12 September 2013. The second series, consisting of six episodes, started airing on 23 April 2014 on Channel 4 and concluded on 28 May 2014. In November 2014, Channel 4 announced that a 60-minute "final" special episode of Derek would air in the United Kingdom on 22 December 2014.
Genesis and pilot
The pilot episode aired on 12 April 2012 on Channel 4. Filmed in a mockumentary style, the programming is set mostly in a nursing home, and centres on Derek, a helper at the home. The title character made their first appearance in the 2001 Edinburgh Fringe show Rubbernecker.
Gervais says the programming was inspired by their relatives who work in care homes: "Half my family are care workers. My sister works with kids with learning difficulties. My sister-in-law works in a care home for people with Alzheimer's. And four or five of my nieces work in old people's homes. I always write about what I know."
Plot
Gervais plays 50-year-old Derek Noakes, a care worker at Broad Hill, a home for the elderly; they have worked there for three years. They like watching reality television shows and game shows, and is interested in celebrities, YouTube and, above all, talking about animals. The viewer is told they are kind, helpful and selfless, with good intentions.  They are vulnerable because of their childlike naivety and distractions from society.  They are ridiculed and ostracised, as well as marginalised by mainstream society because of their social awkwardness and lack of inhibition. Derek says it is more important to be kind than to be clever or good-looking. Some commentators called them autistic, although Gervais firmly denies this. Gervais, in fact, refuses to confirm whether Derek is intellectually-challenged, autistic, or otherwise.

Reception
On Rotten Tomatoes the first series holds a rating of 53% based on 32 critics, with the consensus reading: "Derek is as irreverent as might be expected from a show starring Ricky Gervais, but this time they bring a surprising amount of depth and empathy to the title character." On Metacritic, the first series of the show earned a rating of 64 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
The show generated occasional controversy due to a perception by some viewers it mocks intellectual disability. Tanya Gold, writing for The Guardian, dismissed Gervais's claims in Derek, they were satirising prejudice against disabled people, instead saying it "feels more like lazy cruelty than satire". Jack Seale criticised the show for relying on elements and characterisations from other programming by Gervais. The Guardians Sam Wollaston found it to be "not very good", and says "the whole mockumentary thing feels tired now".
Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent questioned the wisdom of commissioning the programming: "To my mind, the pilot of Ricky Gervais's comedy about an assistant in a retirement home already fully explored its awkward – and testing – balance of comedy and emotion." About the titular character, they wrote "Derek's redeeming qualities are the hardest to take – a sense of self-congratulation at the refinement of its sentiments that has a little bit of the bully in it, too."
Gervais' performance as Derek received mixed reviews. Diane Werts of Newsday reacted positively, saying "Gervais nailed it". Curt Wagner of Red Eye says Gervais "surprises with some tender, quiet acting, and obvious love of the character. Rob Owen of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says "although there could be an ick factor to Mr. Gervais playing a character with developmental issues, that turns out not to be the case. Mr. Gervais creates a character, not a caricature." On the other hand, The Guardians Sam Wollaston says "Ricky Gervais is out of their depth playing a character that isn't based on their worst foibles." Terry Ramsey of The Telegraph says "There is Gervais's cringe-making performance in the title role. I'm sorry, but Derek is simply Ricky Gervais in a patterned jumper with a cricked neck. Gervais is not a character actor, and what Derek needs to bring them alive is to be more believable. What they really needs is someone else playing him."
The second series of Derek generated some positive reviews. The second series currently holds a 67% based on 9 critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post reacted positively, saying "Derek is an honest and often charming endeavor." Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly also praised the show, but says the absence of Karl Pilkington hurt the series, saying: "The second series mostly upholds the first's tricky precedent, but the absence of regular Gervais associate Karl Pilkington means the yuks are a bit less hearty." Terry Ramsey of The Telegraph wrote, "We didn't need a second series of Ricky Gervais's comedy drama Derek." In a review in The Guardian, Sam Wollaston says "That's the other big problem with Derek...it's not very smart. Or very funny. Or very good." Msn.com says "Ricky Gervais' Derek remains a mawkish mess. Where to begin? The mockumentary format is moribund. The ethics are muddy. The tone is all over the place in everything but its consistent condescension." Matt D of Unrealitytv.co.uk agrees, saying "The primary reasons for this are the imbalance in tone and Gervais' central performance both of which stop Derek from a truly enjoyable program." AV Club says "Derek has all the creative ambition of [an online video of little piggies and bunnies doing cute things]." Indie Wire says "Series two is all over the map." Michael Hogan of The Telegraph says Derek is a "saccharine series" and "dreadful". Serena Davies, from the same publication, says "the show seems to have been devised by someone of Derek's limited intelligence... [I will not be] wasting any more of my time watching this rather flimsy, curiously pointless program."
The special was given two stars out of five by The Telegraph. The reviewer, Ed Power, criticised the episode for the "weak performance" from Gervais and the "sub-Forrest Gump sympathy milking". They described it as "glib" and "manipulative". The Guardian reviewer Julia Raeside concurred, adding "I can find no comedy in it, and it lacks the emotional truth required for a drama."

Adamsite or DM is an organic compound; technically, an arsenical diphenylaminechlorarsine, that can be used as a riot control agent. DM belongs to the group of chemical warfare agents known as vomiting agents or sneeze gases. First synthesized in Germany by Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1915, it was independently developed by the US chemist Roger Adams (for whom it is named) at the University of Illinois in 1918.
Composition
DM is an odourless crystalline compound with a very low vapour pressure. The colour of the crystals ranges from bright yellow to dark green depending on the purity. It is readily soluble in some organic solvents (e.g., acetone, dichloromethane), but nearly insoluble in water. In vaporous form it appears as a canary yellow smoke.
Effects
Adamsite is usually dispersed as an aerosol, making the upper respiratory tract the primary site of action. Although the effects are similar to those caused by typical riot control agents (e.g. CS), they are slower in onset but longer in duration, often lasting for 12 or more hours. After a latency period of 5–10 minutes irritation of the eyes, lungs and mucous membranes develops followed by headache, nausea and persistent vomiting.
Usage
DM was produced and stockpiled by the British and the United States at the end of World War I. It was used by the British during the incursions at Murmansk and Archangel. It is now regarded as obsolete and has been widely replaced by riot control agents such as CS which are less toxic and more rapid in the onset of symptoms. Early battlefield use was intended to be via "Adamsite candles". These were large metal cans or tubes (weighing approximately ) which contained a smoke composition made of Adamsite plus a slow burning pyrotechnic composition. A series of candles were lit and the Adamsite-laden smoke allowed to drift towards the enemy.
In the United States, it was used against the Bonus Army who demonstrated in Washington, DC, in 1932, reportedly causing the death and serious injury of several children who had accompanied their parents on the protests. It was again used in the Vietnam War.
In 2003, North Korea was reportedly producing Adamsite at its Aoji-ri Chemical Complex in Haksong-ri, Kyŏnghŭng county for stockpiling. DM was allegedly used by Venezuelan authorities in the 2014–17 Venezuelan protests and described as "green gas" with reports of protesters vomiting following exposure and regional human rights groups condemning the usage of "green gas", stating that its usage is "internationally banned".

ALSN (Автоматическая локомотивная сигнализация непрерывная, in Latin - Avtomaticheskaya Lokomotivnaya Signalizatsiya Nepreryvnaya, meaning Continuous Automatic Train Signalling) is a train control system used widely on the main lines of the ex-Soviet states (Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia). It uses modulated pulses inducted into rails similar to the Italian RS4 Codici and American Pulse Code Cab Signaling. On high-speed lines the variant ALS-EN (АЛС-ЕН) is used which takes advantage of a double phase difference modulation of the carrier wave.
The name ALSN (АЛСН - автоматическая локомотивная сигнализация непрерывного действия) is composed of ALS, literally "Automatic Locomotive Signalling" (АЛС - автоматическая локомотивная сигнализация) and the variant designation N "Continuous Effect" (Н - Непрерывного действия). Other variants are built according to the same scheme as ALST (АЛСТ) for "Fixed Point Automatic Train Signalling" (АЛС точечного действия) and ALSR (АЛСР) for "Radio-Based Automatic Train Signalling" (АЛС с использованием радиоканала). The term ALS-ARS (АЛС-АРС) refers to "Automatic Train Signalling with Automatic Speed Regulation" (автоматическая локомотивная сигнализация с автоматическим регулированием скорости) used in subways which is a form of an automatic train control system.
ALSN operation principles
The system makes use of several distinct pulse train patterns of alternating current flowing through a track circuit to convey an aspect of the next signal. The circuit comprises the feedpoint at the next signal, one running rail, first locomotive axle, another running rail and back to the signal feedpoint. The resulting electromagnetic field is picked up by receiver coils located just front of the first axle of the locomotive. The signal is then amplified, filtered and evaluated.
If the received signal changes from a more permissive to a less permissive aspect (like when passing a yellow light, indicating the next signal is red, which, in turn, requires stopping in front of it), an immediate vigilance control acknowledge is required; depending on configuration and aspects, periodic checks and a speed limit may be enforced as well.
The benefits of the system are relative encoder simplicity (a simple motor-operated camwheel closing and opening relay contacts generates the pulse train) and the ability to use the same signal for track occupancy detection. The drawbacks are a somewhat long response time unsuitable for high speed operation (which resulted in ALS-EN's implementation), and the necessity to switch between 25/50/75 Hz frequency variants depending on traction current type (AC/DC) and other conditions.
VEPS
A new, modular ALSN automatic train protection onboard system VEPS has been under development since 2002 in Estonia. Based on programmable logic controller technologies, the system was developed by Estonian Railway engineers and patented in 2004 by Indrek Syld. The new system was installed in the CE35 type of locomotive (77 systems) during 2003-2004. A new platform (level 2.0) was installed on Stadler's FLIRT trains for Estonia in 2012 (76 systems), and in 2016 a third generation of the system was introduced for the international market.
KLUB
Since the 1990s, the Russian Railroad Company has introduced a computerized successor system KLUB-U which requires either ALSN only or both, ALSN and ALS-EN sensors for compatibility. In ERTMS the ALSN/ALS-EN systems are listed as ETCS Class-B systems.
ALS-ARS
A similar in general theory of operation, but differently implemented, is an ALS-ARS system used in subways of the former Soviet Union. It uses low frequency signals transmitted and received as described above, with the difference that the signals are continuous wave and the signal's frequency determines its code meaning, which results in much faster response time. Typically, two frequencies are transmitted at the same time, indicating the current speed limit and, if lower, the limit for the next section, providing the train driver with a warning and time to react and reduce speed.
In case of an overspeed, the train is unconditionally braked to the indicated speed limit, and then, if not acknowledged by a driver pressing a vigilance button, to a complete stop. Should be there no frequency received (such as on an uncoded track in a maintenance depot or in case of an equipment failure), the driver may proceed at a low speed while holding a vigilance pedal.

E.M.D. was a Swedish boyband consisting of Erik Segerstedt, Mattias Andréasson and Danny Saucedo. All three members had participated on the Swedish version of Idol, with Erik as a finalist and Danny at 6th place on Idol 2006. Mattias was eliminated as the fourth runner-up on Idol 2007.
After Idol, the three formed E.M.D. releasing three albums and had a number of singles, including four consecutive #1s in 2007–2009 for "All for Love", "A State of Mind", "Jennie Let Me Love You" and "Baby Goodbye". In January 2009, the band won a Swedish Grammy for Song of The Year with "Jennie Let Me Love You".
In late 2010, the band announced an indefinite hiatus and broke up. The three members reunited in 2019 with a cover of the song "Hon är min", a song by GES.
Beginnings
Erik Segerstedt (born 20 April 1983 in Uddevalla) was the runner-up on the third season of Swedish version of Idol 2006. Soon after, they got signed at Sony BMG and on 21 February 2007 their debut album A Different Shade was released. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Swedish albums chart and stayed at this position for a second week. The first single "I Can't say I'm Sorry", written by Andreas Carlsson, peaked at No. 1 on the Swedish singles chart.
Mattias Andréasson born on 29 March 1981, Swedish singer and contestant for Swedish Idol 2007 They came 5th place. After Idol, their version of Elton John's Your Song was released as a single and reached 48th place on Hitlistan.
Danny Saucedo (born Daniel Gabriel Alessandro Saucedo Grzechowski on 25 February 1986 in Stockholm, Stockholms Län, Sweden) is a Swedish singer, often presented just as Danny, who competed as one of the finalists in Idol 2006 – the Swedish version of Idol where they got to the top 6 before being eliminated. Their mother is from Bolivia and their father is from Poland. In 2006, they released their first single, a cover of "Öppna din dörr" by Tommy Nilsson which charted at No. 24 on the Swedish singles chart. Danny is also a songwriter, composing songs for Alcazar and Pulse.
Career
After both Erik Segerstedt and Danny Saucedo had released successful solo albums, the first with their A Different Shade and the second with their album Heart Beats, during the Autumn of 2007, they formed alongside Mattias Andréasson the Swedish trio E.M.D.. Their first single, a cover of Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting's hit "All For Love", rose to 3rd place on Hitlistan on December 20 of the same year. "All for Love" charted on Swedish national record chart immediately.
Based on the success of "All for Love", E.M.D. released their debut album, A State of Mind, in May 2008. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Swedish Album Chart and produced three additional domestic charts topping singles after "All for Love", being "Jennie Let Me Love You", "Alone" and, after the deluxe album edition, the single Baby Goodbye.
E.M.D had participated in the 2009 Melodifestivalen with the track "Baby Goodbye". being one of the four wildcards and having performed during the third semi-final in Leksand, on 21 February 2009. E.M.D. made it to the final, where they finished third.
Due to the success of "Baby Goodbye", the album was re-released as a deluxe edition with "Baby Goodbye" and the two new additional songs "Youngblood" (later released as a digital download single) and "I'm No Romeo".
On 9 November 2009 E.M.D. released their second album and first holiday album Välkommen hem, containing Swedish Christmas music and the album's first and only single Välkommen Hem originally sung by Magnus Carlsson) was released on 13 November 2009. The album was sold exclusively at ICA retail stores. The Christmas single charted at third place on Sverigetopplistan.
E.M.D. finished the studio recording of their second studio album and third album overall entitled Rewind in 2010. The band released the first single from the album, "Save Tonight" a cover of a song by Eagle-Eye Cherry), digitally on 28 May 2010. It charted on Sverigetopplistan at fifth place. The single was physically released on 16 June 2010. The album was released on 3 December 2010. The second single from the album "What Is Love", a cover of a song by Haddaway was released digitally on 19 October 2010. The album was released on 3 December 2010 with the release of the "There's a Place for Us" third single and second music video for the album on 5 December 2010, after the music video was released on 26 November.
In late 2010, the band announced an indefinite breakup.
In popular culture
"There's a Place for Us" is a bonus track on E.M.D.'s album Rewind and was featured as the main theme song in the Swedish version of both the motion picture and soundtrack for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The original version of the song which is otherwise featured in the motion picture and soundtrack was performed by Carrie Underwood.
Awards
In January 2009, the band won a Swedish Grammy for Song of the Year with "Jennie Let Me Love You".

Red Pepper is a daily tabloid newspaper in Uganda that began publication on 19 June 2001. Mirroring tabloid styles in other countries, the paper is known for its mix of sensationalism, scandal, and frequent nudity. The paper has received the ire of the Ugandan government for publishing conspiracy theories relating to the death of Sudan's Vice President John Garang in a helicopter crash and revealing that former foreign minister James Wapakhabulo died of AIDS.
In August 2006, Red Pepper published the first names and occupations of prominent Ugandan men whom it asserted were gay. This decision was sharply criticized by Human Rights Watch, which said that the publishing could have exposed the men to government harassment because homosexuality in Uganda remained illegal. The following month, Red Pepper published a similar list of 13 women whom it claimed were lesbians.
In an interview published in May 2009, the news editor of Red Pepper, Ben Byarabaha, vowed that the tabloid would continue its campaign against alleged homosexuals by publishing their names, photographs, and addresses.
In September 2012, the newspaper was sued about its published nude photo of an herbalist. In January 2018, Red Pepper was reopened by the gorverment

2013 police raid
Uganda Police raided the premises of Red Pepper on 20 May 2013. This happened soon after the paper had published a letter allegedly written by Army General David Sejusa, threatening that those opposing Muhoozi Kainerugaba for presidency risked their lives. Kainerugaba is the son of the long-standing President Yoweri Museveni. The same letter was also published by another Ugandan newspaper, the Daily Monitor, whose offices were also raided. Both daily newspapers remained closed for ten consecutive days, until the siege was lifted on 30 May 2013.
2021 Rebranding & Office Relocation
Around mid-2021, the company rebranded From Red Pepper to Daily Pepper still a tabloid Newsletter.
Around Late 2021, the company relocated from its main offices from Namanve_along Jinja Road to Bweyogerere-Buto just opposite UNBS.

Buzescu is a commune in Teleorman County, Muntenia, Romania. It is composed of a single village, Buzescu. It is well known for its wealthy Roma inhabitants and their extravagant Romani palaces.
At the 2002 census, 77% of inhabitants were ethnic Romanians and 22.9% Roma. However, more recent estimates place the number at around 35% Roma.
The town runs along a single street filled with various Romani mansions. Most Romanians live outside the town in the surrounding rural area. The Romani usually only occupy a portion of their houses due to the cost of air conditioning. The Romani citizens abide by their own code of honor that emphasizes silence called omerta.
In terms of religious affiliation, 94.9% identified as Romanian Orthodox and 4.7% as Seventh-day Adventist.
History
Following the abolition of slavery in Romania in the 1860s, the first recently freed Roma families settled in this part of Romania to work as metal smiths. Because of this profession they became known as the Kalderash clan. Nowadays, the town has changed much with the new extravagant mansions of wealthy Roma that contrast with the rural cottages of Romanian peasants in the countryside. The Kalderash Roma of the town are said to have made their wealth trading scrap metal in a previously unregulated market. However, since Romania joined the European Union more regulations have been put on this trade and only a handful of Buzescu's families are extremely wealthy.
Tourism and culture
Buzescu's unique architecture attracts many western tourists interested in the Romani culture. Each building represents the family that lives in it through the use of certain colors in combination with lines or elements of oriental architecture. The size of the building represents the wealth and social standing of its owner. In addition, the Kalderash Roma of Buzescu adhere strictly to cultural clothing practices. Each cultural costume has a certain significance. The colors of the costume worn by women and girls, the number of skirts, and the color and ornamentation of the shirts, all are significant in the Kalderash Romani culture. Tourists have the opportunity to understand the significance of each color in relation to the age of the person wearing that particular object plus the knowledge about Romani family life and customs. Jewellery, especially made of gold, accompany the traditional outfit, individualizing each person.

Maurizio De Giovanni (born March 31, 1958 in Napoli) is an Italian author of mystery novels.
Biography
Maurizio De Giovanni was born in Naples in 1958; they have spent the majority of their life living and working there. In 2005 they decided to join a Porsche Italia competition reserved for giallo novelists, and that's where they came up with the character of Commissario Ricciardi, main protagonist of their first short story, “I vivi e I morti”. This was the start of their career as a writer. Subsequently, “I Vivi e i morti” served as an inspiration for “Le lacrime del pagliaccio” (later re-published as “I will have vengeance - The winter of commissario Ricciardi”), edited by Graus Editore.
With the publishing of this very novel, the chronicles of Commissario Ricciardi had officially begun.
In 2007 Fandango published “I will have vengeance - The winter of commissario Ricciardi”, their first work inspired to the 4 seasons of the year. Following this, in 2008,”Blood curse - The springtime of commissario Ricciardi” was released. In 2009 it was time for “Everyone in their place - The summer of commissario Ricciardi” and finally, in 2010, “The day of the dead - The autumn of commissario Ricciardi” made their appearance in the bookstores. They started to gain a wider audience and made a name for themselves because of this series.
In 2011 they had their first book published by Einaudi, “By my hand - A commissario Ricciardi mystery”.
In 2012 they went down the path of the noir genre and they managed to come up with a book titled “The Crocodile”, that marked the first appearance on the scenes of the new main character of their novels, Ispettore Lojacono.
In the same year, together with Einaudi, they published the pocket version of the seasons' novels and the brand new “Viper - A commissario Ricciardi mystery”.
In 2013 he's back on the scenes with “The Bastards of Pizzofalcone”, inspired by the 87th Precinct series from Ed McBain. This marked their transition from the noir genre to the police procedural. Shortly after they wrote “Darkness for the Bastards of Pizzofalcone”. These novels will be transformed into a TV show.
In the same month when they completed “Darkness”, their short story “Un giorno di Settembre a Natale”, contained in the anthology “Regalo di Natale”, was published by the editor Sellerio.
2014 was a very prolific year for Maurizio. Not only 15 of their best noir stories were released in the anthology called “Mani insanguinate”, they also had two new novels published, “Bottom of your heart” (by Einaudi) and “Gelo per i bastardi di Pizzofalcone”.
In 2015 “Glass souls”,the 8th installment in the Ricciardi's series, was released. In the same year, they appeared at an event at the Italian Cultural Institute in Edinburgh, in conversation with academic Raffaella Ocone discussing the success of the detective story.
In 2016 they had both “Serenata senza nome. Notturno per il commissario Ricciardi. and “Pane per i Bastardi di Pizzofalcone” published.
The majority of their works are currently translated into the following languages: English, Spanish, Catalan, French and German.

Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2009), is a 5–4 decision by the United States Supreme Court that overruled the Court's decision in Michigan v. Jackson. The case concerned the validity of a defendant's waiver of their right to counsel during a police interrogation. In reversing Jackson, the Court said such a waiver was valid.
Facts
At a preliminary hearing, Montejo was charged with first-degree murder. Montejo was also appointed court-ordered counsel, which they neither expressly requested nor denied. Later that day, while in prison, police read Montejo their Miranda rights, and they agreed to go along on a trip to locate the murder weapon. While in the police car, Montejo wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim's widow. Only upon return did Montejo first finally meet their court-appointed attorney. At trial, the letter of apology was admitted over Montejo's objection. The jury convicted Montejo of first-degree murder, and they were sentenced to death.
Supreme Court's decision
In a decision written by Justice Scalia, the Court expressly overturned Michigan v. Jackson, , asserting that requiring an initial “invocation” of the right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson presumption, might work in States that require an indigent defendant formally to request counsel before an appointment is made, but not in more than half the States, which appoint counsel without request from the defendant.
Justice Alito filed a concurring opinion. Justice Stevens, who had written the Opinion of the Court in the overturned Jackson, filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg joined. Justice Breyer joined that dissenting opinion, except for footnote 5. Justice Breyer also filed a separate dissenting opinion.
Analysis
The Fifth Amendment's right to counsel attaches upon invocation (i.e., when an attorney is requested). The Sixth Amendment's right to counsel attaches when adversarial proceedings begin (i.e., at the arraignment). The presumption in Jackson attempted to analogize the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination through Edwards v. Arizona to the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel, essentially not allowing police interrogation after the right attached. Under Montejo, in the case where the Defendant has not asserted their Fifth Amendment's right to counsel but rather relies on their Sixth Amendment's right to counsel, police may reinitiate interrogation after their Miranda rights have been read. However, if a Defendant has asserted their Fifth Amendment's right to counsel and adversarial proceedings have begun, police may not reinitiate questioning without counsel present and waiver under Edwards, or unless the Defendant initiates the conversation and police get a waiver. Criticisms of the Montejo decision include arguments that the case's importation of Fifth Amendment rationale into Sixth Amendment contexts "has resulted in a blurring of the line between legitimate law enforcement efforts and illegitimate police deception."

Bathgate Lower railway station was a railway station serving the town of Bathgate in West Lothian, Scotland. It was located on the Bathgate Branch of the Monkland Railways.
History
Bathgate was opened by the Monkland Railways in 1856, and renamed Bathgate Lower on 1 August 1865 by the North British Railway at the same time as the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway station of the same name was renamed Bathgate Upper.
The station was closed, along with the other station on the branch - - by the LNER on 1 May 1930.
Bathgate Lower was situated between Easton Road and Cochrane Street in Bathgate. From the station, a branch continued to Balbardie Colliery to the north east of the station, and a further branch to Easton Colliery to the south west of the station. The main branch continued 4 miles and 6 chains west from Bathgate Lower to Blackston Jct, where it joined the Slamannan Railway

Self-organized criticality (SOC) is a property of dynamical systems that have a critical point as an attractor. Their macroscopic behavior thus displays the spatial or temporal scale-invariance characteristic of the critical point of a phase transition, but without the need to tune control parameters to a precise value, because the system, effectively, tunes itself as it evolves towards criticality.
The concept was put forward by Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld ("BTW") in a paper
published in 1987 in Physical Review Letters, and is considered to be one of the mechanisms by which complexity arises in nature. Its concepts have been applied across fields as diverse as geophysics, physical cosmology, evolutionary biology and ecology, bio-inspired computing and optimization (mathematics), economics, quantum gravity, sociology, solar physics, plasma physics, neurobiology and others.
SOC is typically observed in slowly driven non-equilibrium systems with many degrees of freedom and strongly nonlinear dynamics. Many individual examples have been identified since BTW's original paper, but to date there is no known set of general characteristics that guarantee a system will display SOC.
Overview
Self-organized criticality is one of a number of important discoveries made in statistical physics and related fields over the latter half of the 20th century, discoveries which relate particularly to the study of complexity in nature. For example, the study of cellular automata, from the early discoveries of Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann through to John Conway's Game of Life and the extensive work of Stephen Wolfram, made it clear that complexity could be generated as an emergent feature of extended systems with simple local interactions. Over a similar period of time, Benoît Mandelbrot's large body of work on fractals showed that much complexity in nature could be described by certain ubiquitous mathematical laws, while the extensive study of phase transitions carried out in the 1960s and 1970s showed how scale invariant phenomena such as fractals and power laws emerged at the critical point between phases.
The term self-organized criticality was first introduced in Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's 1987 paper, which clearly linked together those factors: a simple cellular automaton was shown to produce several characteristic features observed in natural complexity (fractal geometry, pink (1/f) noise and power laws) in a way that could be linked to critical-point phenomena. Crucially, however, the paper emphasized that the complexity observed emerged in a robust manner that did not depend on finely tuned details of the system: variable parameters in the model could be changed widely without affecting the emergence of critical behavior: hence, self-organized criticality. Thus, the key result of BTW's paper was its discovery of a mechanism by which the emergence of complexity from simple local interactions could be spontaneous—and therefore plausible as a source of natural complexity—rather than something that was only possible in artificial situations in which control parameters are tuned to precise critical values. An alternative view is that SOC appears when the criticality is linked to a value of zero of the control parameters.
Despite the considerable interest and research output generated from the SOC hypothesis, there remains no general agreement with regards to its mechanisms in abstract mathematical form. Bak Tang and Wiesenfeld based their hypothesis on the behavior of their sandpile model.
Models of self-organized criticality
In chronological order of development:
Stick-slip model of fault failure
Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile
Forest-fire model
Olami–Feder–Christensen model
Bak–Sneppen model
Early theoretical work included the development of a variety of alternative SOC-generating dynamics distinct from the BTW model, attempts to prove model properties analytically (including calculating the critical exponents), and examination of the conditions necessary for SOC to emerge. One of the important issues for the latter investigation was whether conservation of energy was required in the local dynamical exchanges of models: the answer in general is no, but with (minor) reservations, as some exchange dynamics (such as those of BTW) do require local conservation at least on average .
It has been argued that this model would actually generate 1/f2 noise rather than 1/f noise. This claim was based on untested scaling assumptions, and a more rigorous analysis showed that sandpile models
generally produce 1/fa spectra, with a<2.
Other simulation models were proposed later that could produce true 1/f noise,.
In addition to the nonconservative theoretical model mentioned above , other theoretical models for SOC have been based upon information theory,
mean field theory,
the convergence of random variables,
and cluster formation. A continuous model of self-organised criticality is proposed by using tropical geometry.
Key theoretical issues yet to be resolved include the calculation of the possible universality classes of SOC behavior and the question of whether it is possible to derive a general rule for determining if an arbitrary algorithm displays SOC.
Self-organized criticality in nature
SOC has become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including:
The magnitude of earthquakes (Gutenberg–Richter law) and frequency of aftershocks (Omori law)
Fluctuations in economic systems such as financial markets (references to SOC are common in econophysics)
The evolution of proteins
Forest fires
Neuronal avalanches in the cortex
Acoustic emission from fracturing materials
Despite the numerous applications of SOC to understanding natural phenomena, the universality of SOC theory has been questioned. For example, experiments with real piles of rice revealed their dynamics to be far more sensitive to parameters than originally predicted. Furthermore, it has been argued that 1/f scaling in EEG recordings are inconsistent with critical states, and whether SOC is a fundamental property of neural systems remains an open and controversial topic.
Self-organized criticality and optimization
It has been found that the avalanches from an SOC process make effective patterns in a random search for optimal solutions on graphs.
An example of such an optimization problem is graph coloring. The SOC process apparently helps the optimization from getting stuck in a local optimum without the use of any annealing scheme, as suggested by previous work on extremal optimization.

Mads Hinrichsen Aaquist (born 31 December 1994) is a Danish professional footballer who plays for Danish 1st Division club Fremad Amager.
Club career
Copenhagen
Aaquist is a product of F.C. Copenhagen's youth sector. They began playing for the first team in the winter 2012/13 and played several friendly matches for the club. They expressed at this point to the medias, that they would wish they were a permanent part of the first team. Aaquist gained their first Danish Superliga match and official debut for FCK on 20 May 2013, when they replaced Christian Bolaños in the final match of the season, a home game against SønderjyskE.
Just hours after the announcement of their return to FCK, it was further announced, that FCK had terminated their contract.
Loan to AC Horsens
In the autumn 2014, they were loaned out to AC Horsens for the rest of the season. Aaquist played their first match for the club on 27 July 2014 against Viborg FF. However, Aaquist was struggling to get playtime and did only play 6 matches. AC Horsens announced on 21 January 2015, that they had sent Aaquist return to FCK six months earlier than expected.
FC Helsingør
On 21 January 2015, Aaquist signed with FC Helsingør on a free transfer. They signed a contract until the summer 2015, and later extended their contract after playing 14 league games for the club in their first 6 months. They got their debut for FC Helsingør on 26 July 2015. Aaquist started on the bench, but replaced Jonas Hebo Rasmussen in the 60th minute in a 0-3 defeat against FC Roskilde in the Danish 1st Division.
The defender extended their contract for three years in May 2016. They played 27 league matches in their first season at the club.
Nordsjælland
Aaquist signed for FC Nordsjælland on 22 August 2017.
Randers
Aaquist joined Randers FC on 23 August 2018 on loan until 30 June 2019.
Viborg
After their loan spell with Randers FC, Aaquist returned to FC Nordsjælland and started in the first five league games. However, they moved to Viborg FF in the Danish 1st Division on 22 August 2019, where they signed a three-year deal.
Fremad Amager
On 31 January 2022, Aaquist joined fellow league club Fremad Amager on a deal for the rest of the season.
Position
Aaquist used to play as a fullback, mostly on the right side, but in the 2016/17 season, they mostly played as a left or right midfielder. They even played in the central midfield the whole match against Vejle Boldklub in May 2017.

Evan Rosen is an American author, speaker, business strategist, blogger, and journalist.  They are a Executive Director of The Culture of Collaboration Institute and Chief Strategist of Impact Video Communication, Inc., which they co-founded.
Rosen is the author of The Culture of Collaboration series of books. The first book in the series is The Culture of Collaboration (), a Gold Medal Winner in the Axiom Business Book Awards. The second book in the series is The Bounty Effect: 7 Steps to The Culture of Collaboration (). The Bounty Effect includes a back-cover endorsement from Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple.
Work
The Culture of Collaboration shows how collaboration creates business value and demonstrates how collaborative culture is changing business models and the nature of work. Terms Rosen coins in the book include mirror zones, which are time zones that are opposite or nearly opposite, and the Ten Cultural Elements of Collaboration. Companies used as examples in the book include Boeing, Toyota, The Dow Chemical Company, Procter & Gamble, BMW, Mayo Clinic, Myelin Repair Foundation, Industrial Light & Magic and DreamWorks Animation. According to a review by the Axiom Business Book Awards, “Whether it is dealing with the changing trends of business or the basic cultural elements that enable collaboration, Rosen is able to offer insight on every situation.” According to a profile of Rosen in the MIT Technology Review, “American society, says Rosen, encourages individualism and a star system, which inhibits the very collaboration that they maintain can make companies more effective.”
The Bounty Effect: 7 Steps to The Culture of Collaboration provides a framework for replacing obsolete Industrial Age organizational structures based on command-and-control with collaborative organizational structures designed for the Information Age. The book gets its name from the mutiny that occurred on the H.M.S. Bounty in 1789. Rosen uses the mutiny to illustrate how exigent circumstances compel companies, governments and organizations to change their structures from command-and-control to collaborative. According to a review in Publishers Weekly: “In their book, Rosen, an internationally recognized collaboration and communication strategist, presents seven steps to establishing a collaborative culture within an organization, moving away from the Industrial Age mentality to one better suited for the Information Age.”
Rosen is also the author of Personal Videoconferencing (Manning/Prentice Hall, 1996, ), the first book on PC-based videoconferencing. In the book, they coined the word collabicate, which means to collaborate and communicate.
Biography
Rosen delivers keynote speeches globally at corporate and government events such as the National Conference on Clinical Research in Gothenburg, Sweden and the Tagetik User Conference in Lucca, Italy. They have also lectured at the Brookings Institution and the Stanford University Center for Professional Development. On the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Rosen delivered a speech on how to adopt cross-agency collaborative culture and processes to the United States Intelligence Community at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).
Rosen's work has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Forbes, The Washington Post, MIT Technology Review, CIO Magazine, IndustryWeek, NetworkWorld, InformationWeek, Workforce, The Washington Times, Executive Travel, Talent Management, Computerworld Canada, Leader to Leader, CableWorld, Communication World, Sales and Marketing Management, InfoWorld Netherlands, TechWorld United Kingdom, Exame Magazine of Brazil, and they have appeared on CNN, CBS News, CNBC's "Collaboration Now" primetime special and on numerous local television and radio broadcasts. Rosen's "Collaboration" columns have appeared on Bloomberg BusinessWeek.com They also write The Culture of Collaboration® blog.
Rosen spent their early career reporting on Silicon Valley and the automobile industry for television stations. They have held news positions at KICU-TV in San Jose, WTOL-TV in Toledo, WABC-TV in New York, WXYZ-TV in Detroit, KODE-TV in Joplin, Missouri, and WCBN-FM in Ann Arbor.
They hold a B.A. in history from the University of Michigan -Ann Arbor where they were news director and a member of the board of directors of the Campus Broadcasting Network.  They are also a graduate of Horace Mann School in New York City where they were a executive editor of The Record.

Snapdragon (Lorna Leigh Raeburn) is a fictional character, a superhero of Marvel Comics, member of the Strikeforce: Morituri. The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson.
Publication history
Snapdragon (Lorna Leigh Raeburn) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #1 (December 1986). The codename "Snapdragon" was introduced in issue #2. Snapdragon remained a regular character until their death in issue #4. They were the first regular character to die in the series, opening a long string of deaths.
Fictional character biography
Nothing is known of Lorna Leigh Raeburn's life prior to them joining Strikeforce: Morituri. A sassy, confident young woman, at some point, in 2073, they volunteered for the Morituri program, a program which could confer superhuman abilities to ordinary people, to be used in the ongoing war of Earth against the evil alien race known as the Horde. However, the powers came at a terrible price: the recipients invariably died within a year of taking the process, their powers flaring up and their bodies rejecting their newly inserted metabolism with fatal results.
Undaunted, Lorna applied for the process and was found genetically compatible to undertake it, one in only six among thousands of applicants. As such, Lorna was subjected to the process, becoming part of the first official generation of Strikeforce: Morituri.
Later, the team members were sent to the Garden (the nickname of Biowar Zone Alpha), a booby-trapped artificial environment, whose objective was to help the heroes manifest their superhuman powers by exposing them to extreme danger and stress. Lorna was the only one of their teammates who was not threatened by any of the myriad traps of the Garden. Instead, their powers surfaced when their panicked teammate, Vyking, snapped out and accused their Commander, Beth Nion, of trying to kill them, seeing how they had not aborted the test sequence, despite the other members of the team almost dying in the process. Enraged at their accusations against their Commander, Lorna slapped him, simultaneously releasing their plasma burst for the first time, as a result of their extreme anger. After the team members all succeeded in the Garden trial, Lorna assumed the codename "Snapdragon" and incorporated wrist mounted projectors in their costume, which could help them focus their bursts more effectively.
In the next few weeks, Snapdragon and Vyking becoming getting closer to each other, although they never spelled out explicitly any feelings. In the first official mission of the team, in Kramatorsk, Soviet Union, Snapdragon proved exceptionally effective when their teammate, Radian used their E-M radiation emissions to help propel their plasma bursts.
Death
Sometime later, the team was invited to a party in New York City, where they met the actors who would portray them in an upcoming soap opera. The party was interrupted by the intrusion of some Hordian soldiers. During the battle, Snapdragon began experiencing an exhilarating surge of power, the first indication of the deadly Morituri effect catching up. After the battle was over, Snapdragon realized their time was up. Horrified, they ran to get a safe distance from those nearby before vaporizing, their death recorded by countless cameras. They were the first member of their generation of Morituri to die.
Powers and abilities
Snapdragon had the ability to generate plasma bursts, which they focused through the wrist mounted projectors they wore. As a result of their exposure to the Morituri process, they also possessed enhanced strength and agility.

The extended interaction oscillator (EIO) is a linear-beam vacuum tube designed to convert direct current to RF power. The conversion mechanism is the space charge wave process whereby velocity modulation in an electron beam transforms to current or density modulation with distance.
The tubes contain a single resonator. The complete cavity is a rectangular box containing a ladder-like structure through which the electron beam passes. Such a cavity has a large number of resonances but in the resonant mode used, large RF fields are developed in the gaps between the rungs. The phase advance from gap to gap is selected in such a way that an electron sees the same field at every gap, and it is described as being synchronous. In this context, the same field means a field of the same phase but not necessarily the same magnitude.
An electron beam which enters an RF excited cavity with approximately synchronous velocity will receive cumulative velocity modulation at each gap. After some distance into the resonator, repeatedly accelerated electrons will be catching up with electrons repeatedly decelerated, and bunches will form. These bunches will have a velocity close to the beam velocity. If the electron velocity is somewhat greater than synchronous, the bunches will start to cross gaps when the field is retarding, rather than zero. When this happens, the electrons are slowed; their lost energy is gained by the cavity and sustained oscillations become possible. As the velocity of the beam entering the cavity is increased further, more energy is transferred to the cavity and the frequency of oscillation rises somewhat. Eventually, however, the bunches punch through the retarding fields and oscillations cease abruptly. Reducing the beam velocity (voltage) will cause the tube to resume oscillation. However, it is necessary to reduce the beam velocity below the value at which oscillations ceased before oscillation will start again. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis and is similar to that observed in many reflex klystrons.
The frequency change which occurs as the beam voltage is raised is referred to as electronic tuning, and is typically 0.2% of the operating frequency measured from half power to cessation of oscillation. For larger frequency changes mechanical tuning is used which is obtained by moving one wall of the cavity. The moveable wall is, in fact, a piston which can be moved in a tunnel whose cross-section is that of the wall which it replaces. The range of mechanical tuning is usually limited by parasitic resonances which occur when the oscillating frequency and the frequency of one of the many other cavity resonances coincide. When this happens, serious loss is introduced, often sufficient enough to suppress oscillation completely. Typically, a mechanical tuning range of 4% can be obtained but greater ranges have been demonstrated.
Apart from the resonant cavity, the Extended Interaction Oscillator is very similar to more conventional klystrons. An electron gun produces a narrow beam of electrons which is maintained at the required diameter by a magnetic field while it passes through the RF section. Thereafter, the beam enters a relatively field-free region where it spreads out and is collected by an appropriately cooled collector. Many of these oscillators have electrically isolated anodes and in these cases, the voltage between the cathode and anode determines the tube current which in turn determines the maximum power output.

The FSU Southwest Campus (SWC) of Florida State University (FSU) is located in Tallahassee about a mile to the southwest of the Main Campus on approximately remaining out of a large parcel often called "The Farm", a nickname derived from a dairy farm that once operated on the site. Over the years portions of The Farm have been converted to other uses, such as housing, research, golf, mass media and academics.
The Southwest campus includes the FSU Foundation and Research buildings, College of Engineering and the new Advanced Materials Research building. Two athletic complexes are found here; the Morcorm Aquatics Center and Don Veller Golf Course as well as the WFSU Public Broadcast Center (WFSU-TV and WFSU-FM).
To the east and northwest, the SWC abuts residential neighborhoods. The north side adjoins and intermingles with Innovation Park, the research park of which FSU is a participant and within which FSU owns the property on which the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located. Orange Avenue defines the southern border and Rankin Avenue denotes the far west.
Large parcels of the SWC are occupied by venerable Alumni Village on the east side, a student housing complex, the par 73, Don Veller Seminole Golf Course in the middle, and the new Intramural Fields in the northwest corner.
Innovation Park was carved out of the original "Farm" property. FSU retains ownership of the parcels for the prestigious National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Along Levy Street, FSU has begun development of a series of academic-oriented research facilities to house pure research and related centers, institutes, and technology transfer organizations.

Constantijn L'Empereur (July 1591 – June 1648) was a prominent Dutch Hebraist, a distinguished Orientalist and doctor of theology.
Biography
They were born in July 1591 in Bremen, Germany, to where their parents had fled from Belgium to escape religious persecution. They acquired great reputation for their knowledge of the oriental languages. They were also an able lawyer and divine and took their degree of doctor in the latter faculty. They studied the oriental languages under Drusius and Erpenius and after having been professor of theology and Hebrew at Harderwijk for eight years was in 1627 made professor of Hebrew at Leyden on which occasion they delivered an harangue on the dignity and utility of the Hebrew language and it was their constant endeavour to diffuse a knowledge of that language and of the Arabic and Syriac among their countrymen that they might be the better enabled to combat the objections of the Jews to the Christian religion. They translated and published several editions of the popular ‘Travels of Rabbi Benjamin ben Jonah', one Latin-Hebrew Edition with and another one without notes, one Hebrew Edition at Bale, which their Friends – the Buxdorffs – sent to Joseph Scaliger who mentioned it favorably in a letter, which was included in a version of Benjamins Travels, printed in 1666 in Amsterdam, collated with a Dutch translation of the Bara, together with a text from the celebrated rabbi Manassah ben Israel. The Emperor-edition of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela Itinerary was the bases for a popular German and French translation in the 17th and 18th Century.
In 1639 l'Empereur was appointed advisor to the very successful Johan Maurits van Nassau, who was governor of Dutch Brazil from 1637–1644. l'Empereur died in June 1648 very soon after they had begun a course of theology at Leyden. Amongst their closest friends were Daniel Heinsius, the Buxtorffs and Lewis de Dieu, minister of the Eglise Wallon. Daniel Heinsius and the Buxtorfs spoke very highly of him. They offered at one time to superintend the printing of a Talmudical dictionary in Holland and endeavoured to bring the younger Buxtorf to Leyden who had undertaken to defend the vowel points against Louis Cappel. They were also corresponding with the notable archbishop Usher.
Works
L'Empereur's works are: Commentarius ad codicem Babylonicum, seu Tractatus Thalmudicus de mensuris Templi (Leyden, 1630), Versio et Notae ad Paraphrasin Josephi Jachiadae in Danielem (Amsterdam, 1633), Itinerarium D. Benjaminis in Hebrew and Latin (Leyden, 8 volumes), Moysis Kimchi Grammatica Chaldaica (Leyden, 8 volumes), Confutatio Abarbanelis et Alscheichi in caput liii Isaiae (Layden, 8 volumes, 1631, in French 1685), Commentarius in Tractatum Thalmudicum, qui dicitur Porta, de legibus Hebraeorum forensibus in Hebrew and Latin (Layden, 1637) and Commentarius ad Betramum de Republica Hebraeorum (1641, 8 volumes).

The northern double-collared sunbird, or golden-winged sunbird, (Cinnyris reichenowi), is a species of bird in the family Nectariniidae. It is found in Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda.
Description
The northern double-collared sunbird is a medium-sized species. The adult male's head and back is a metallic green that has a steely-blue sheen in some lights. The rump is greyish-brown, the uppertail coverts metallic purple and the tail black, glossed blue. The main flight feathers are dark brown. There is a narrow purple collar beneath the metallic green throat, above a scarlet breast and pale brown belly. There are pale yellow that are not always visible. The eye is black or dark brown, and the beak and legs are black. The adult female is more drab with upper parts dark olive green and a dark brown tail. The underparts are greyish-olive, the belly being tinged with yellow. The juvenile is similar to the adult female.
Ecology
The northern double-collared sunbird is often found in small mixed-species flocks and often associates with the black-capped speirops (Zosterops lugubris) and the oriole finch (Linurgus olivaceus). It tends to perch in the mid-storeys of trees, looking from side to side. It feeds on nectar, insects and their larvae, and spiders. The male is territorial and sings vigorously. It is aggressive throughout the year and attacks con-specific males, sometimes resulting in mid-air fights which may continue on the ground. It also does battle with the Cameroon sunbird (Cyanomitra oritis) and the olive-bellied sunbird (Cinnyris chloropygia).
Status
The northern double-collared sunbird is a common species with a very wide range, and the population trend is thought to be steady. No particular threats have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird's conservation status as being of "least concern".

Henry and Mudge and the Great Grandpas, the 26th book in the Henry and Mudge series, is a 2005 beginning reader's children's book written by Cynthia Rylant and illustrated by Suçie Stevenson. The book was well reviewed and won the 2006 Geisel Award.
Plot
Told in four chapters, Henry and their dog Mudge visit Henry's great grandfather, Bill. Bill lives with several other "grandpas" who all like Henry and Mudge. While the grandpas are resting, Henry and Mudge explore the woods nearby where they find a pond to go swimming. Knowing their parents don't allow them to swim alone, Henry goes back to get their dad to supervise. Bill and the other grandpas decide to go too, with everyone swimming in their underwear. After swimming, they lay out in the sun and the grandpas tell stories about their lives. They then head back to the house where Henry's mother has made spaghetti for them to eat.
Reception and Awards
In a starred review Booklist reviewer Hazel Rochman, wrote that the book, "is even more joyful than the others in the popular series." Several reviewers noted the way the illustrations provided context clues for new readers ready for short chapter books.
The book won the 2006 Geisel Award for best beginning reader's book awarded by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC). The award committee cited, "The simple sentence structure, along with a design that advances this well-told story, provides a satisfying celebration of family and friendship."

An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific "All-America" and typically referred to as "All-American athletes", or simply "All-Americans". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in the United States team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889.
The NCAA recognizes two different All-America selectors for the 1982 college baseball season: the American Baseball Coaches Association (since 1947) and Baseball America (since 1981).

Ding Richang (; 1823–1882) was a Chinese government official, who is remembered for their "indomitable" if not "prodigious" reform efforts, skill in foreign diplomacy (or "foreign-matters expert"), and supervision of the judicial administration, engaging in anti-tax abuse directed at the Yamen. Magistrate of Jiangxi, they lost and then regained rank to become Shanghai intendant before returning to the devastated Jiangxi in 1867 as Finance Commissioner and then Province Governor from 1868-1870. Ding's lengthy 1868 memorial admits to the hopelessness of effective governance without qualified administrators and structural reform, and in spite of their constant vigilance, corruption by the yamen continued throughout their term, remaining a central issue.
Li Hongzhang relied on Ding for advice on Western military technology, and as Shanghai intendant Ding founded the Kiangnan Arsenal, to which was attached a language school and translation department. It's 200 works had a powerful influence in the modernization of China. They also founded the Lung-mên shu-yuan Academy in Shanghai, which would be reorganized as a normal school in 1904. In their late years they presided over Taiwan during one of the "most dynamic periods" of its history, and the program they laid there is relatable to that of the Self-Strengthening Movement. Despite their reformist propositions and support of Western learning, Ding was strongly committed to Confucianism and opposed the spread of Western religion. However, despite their concern for the former, unlike contemporary censors they were open to the flourishing Buddhist religion.
Early career
Born in Fengshun County, Ding was able to attend school in their childhood at a local temple even though their family was not rich, becoming a licentiate and then earning a stipend for distinction in the annual prefectural examination. Becoming known for their talents in writing, Fengshun's magistrate accepted them as protégé, and an unidentified sponsor paid the expense of the provincial Canton examination. They obtained the rank of student at the Imperial academy at 20, possibly purchased for them by the same, but was never able to master the more abstruse provincial examination. After failing the 1845 examination they became a teacher and secretary to local officials, purchasing the rank of an expectant director of schools. In 1854 they were rewarded with the rank of an expectant magistrate for help in subduing local Cantonese bandits, and in 1856 was appointed subdirector of schools of Qiongzhou (Hainan Island), and magistrate of Jiangxi three years later at the age of thirty-five.
As magistrate Ding controlled corruption in Jiangxi through strict supervision of their subordinates. Their swift policies were praised by the Jiangxi Wan-an gazetteer, and it is said that they reduced the number of backlogged cases from over a hundred to only a few within a month. They also began reconstruction of the academy and city temple, which had been destroyed by Taiping rebels. Departing for Guangdong in 1859 to work in foreign affairs, the people of Wan-an petitioned for their return.
Military Secretariat and Shanghai Intendant
Ting was Soon made acting magistrate of Ji'an with the goal of recapturing the county seat of Chi'an. They succeeded but lost their rank and office after then losing Ji'an to the retreating Taiping rebels in 1861 (though they and their superiors recovered it). Ding's expertise in foreign affairs bought them favour. Following this they supervised firearms manufacturing in Guangdong. Their services in both instances would see their rank restored to them in 1862, and considering them essentially the governor-general was twice successful in petitioning the court to prevent theirs leaving for summons to perform the same in Jiangxi.
Following their service on Hong's secretariat, Hong recommended Ding for prefect, which they were awarded, stressing Ding's role during the campaign that recovered Jiangsu. Ding was soon awarded Shanghai taotai (intendant of Suzhou, Songjiang and Taicang), which entailed constant foreign dealings, for their diplomatic handling of staff negotiations. Going over regular channels, Ding succeeded in acquiring the appointment of a former British officer (William Winstanley) from the Ever Victorious Army for their new unit, much to the chagrin of the British authorities in Shanghai.
As Shanghai taotai, on the basis of treaties they believed the Chinese should honour, they rejected the petitions of Chinese merchants to ban foreign cotton-goods shops, and with difficulty persuaded the inhabitants of Chaozhou to accept foreign entry. On the same basis they rejected American real-estate interests in Shanghai and British steamship traffic. In 1863 they promised to reduce taxes on Chinese junks so as to make them competitive with foreign ships (apparently in bean trade), and wrote to Li Hongzhang suggesting that the Chinese buy and build steamships, which, allowing them to outcompete the foreigners, would remove the need to expel them by force. Their proposal was accepted, but 1864 reports by them memorialize China as being surrounded by enemies, and still demonstrates a clear commitment to ordnance. In 1865, in response to a need by Li Hongzhang and the Yamen for formal training in mechanics and mathematics, they purchased (as an administrator) machinery from a foreign factory at Shanghai, founding the Kiangnan Arsenal. It incorporated Li's previous two Arsenals.
Li was promoted to salt controller in September 1865 before being named the Jiangsu finance commissioner in early 1866, which they performed in 1867. During this time they issued their first lengthy proclamation, which called for better personnel training and selection, examinations, increased reward and punishment, longer terms and higher salaries. They also made an argument for sending diplomats overseas.
Jiangsu Governorship
Receiving Governorship in 1868, Ding took to referring to themselves as a "man up from the fields" in letters to the Emperor, and sent letters of reprimand to their subordinates that had they been commoners and secretaries they would neither be so insensitive nor incompetent. However, apparently unsure of the use of their authority, their words had more sting than their actions. Though avoiding involving them in government they cultivated relationships with local scholar-elites through book-lending from their personal library. Continuing an effort they had made during the war, Ding used their position in Jiangsu to purchase books from destitute Chinese for cataloguing by a subordinate, later writing a more complete catalogue from their home - and inspiring a third by the commissioner of education, Chiang Piao.
Ding established free schools and lectures, reprinting the Expanded Sacred Edicts, subsidized fertilizer, and pressed for repair of waterworks. On the penal side of things they drew up plans in late 1868 for weapon's collection to combat piracy, which was successful, attempted to ban delayed burial, and closed some twenty nunneries supposedly used as brothels. They rebuilt temples and banned religious processions as attracting undesirables, and suppressed gambling. They halted the construction of theatres, though they were unable to exert control over the profession. Although closing urban dens, their campaign against opium was less successful. Their efforts against forced remarriage, including an aid association for widows, were unsuccessful.
However, Ding's chief effort in Suzhou was to improve the tax-collection process. In contrast with their predecessor Feng Guifen, who considered taxes too high even after reduction, Ding considered irregularity the primary problem with the tax administration (while still needing to not overburden the peasants). To accomplish this, using earlier plans earlier proposed by Feng, they simultaneously lightened taxes while establishing norms in the handling of taxes in collection and accounting, uniform conversion rates, and enforcement, using their powers as governor while trying to persuade the central government.
Ding's efforts hinged on control over clerks and runners. While they probably would have preferred the complete restructuring proposed by Feng, they settled for a few of their more important ideas. Their 1868 memorial to the throne proposed limiting clerk positions to non-degree holding scholars (rather than any semi-literate) on the basis that they might value their reputation more. Though not holding a degree they would still have to pass a series of examinations, and would be re-examined every year. To make the position attractive, in addition to comfortable emoluments they could eventually become regular bureaucrats this way. Their proposal was not accepted, probably on account of more pressing expenses and entrenched interests.
During this time they focused their efforts on bringing their local clerks under the supervision of magistrates, improving the latter's selection and establishing channels of communication between them and the peasants. To a large extent these measures consisted in enforcing already present regulations that in the past had only been enforced on their being broken. They made a warning and executed those runners involving in banditry.
In-order to prevent over-collection, they developed to a high degree the publication of all tax information that peasants would need to know. Following this they made efforts to continually supervise and penalize the magistrates themselves. To counterbalance the magistrates (that is, the yamen) they made it so the headmen had to be selected from among village elders, given a travel allowance for reporting, and hopefully being less inclined to extortion made them responsible for local tax-collection. They enforced (and in some cases instituted) responsibility on the magistrates for tax-receipts, and simplified procedures. They tried to curb litigation, which was expensive.
Ding kept tabs on northern Jiangsu (Kiangpei) through secret agents. However, apart from directives they didn't attempt to reform Kiangpei personally, likely considering the impoverished and unruly region beyond their capacity. Though southern Jiangsu and Jiangxi was recovering from the war, it also had an element in the imperial court and an economic diversity that attracted patrons in wealth, commerce and the arts.
Fujian Governorship
Ding attended Taiwan in 1869, and with Imperial sanction reduced the aborigines there. They desired to seriously reform it as a new standard for Canton, but had to leave in 1870 on account of the death of their mother. That same year they participated in the trial for the Tianjin Massacre. They otherwise retired for the next four years, returning to Tianjin in 1875 to conclude treaties with Japan and Peru. In response to the Japanese invasion, during the great policy debates they proposed the need for Western studies and three regional fleets worth of ironclad battleships. They were attacked by the Literati but supported by Li and made director of the Fuzhou Arsenal and governor of Fujian three months later.
Having propounded a pro-colonial stance to the court in the past, during their term they gave much attention to Taiwan. They witnessed the first machine excavation of coal there and oversaw the installation of the first telegraph line in China. They also installed artillery at the forts and inspected the Green Standard Army, dismissing ten officers for corruption. They laid plans for commercial farming and mining, and naval base and a railway (for military purposes), which were approved by the throne, but not did receive funds. Ding tried to root out corruption in the Fujian officialdom but was continually blocked by their subordinates. Growing ill and disillusioned with the possibility of innovation in Taiwan they submitted their resignation, which the throne accepted in April 1878.
Following Ding's resignation they were called upon several times to settle cases involving foreigners. Submitting a number of memorials on foreign affairs, in 1879 they were given the titles of Foreign Affairs and Governor General of the defenses of South China, which, together with soliciting funds for the Shanxi famine, occupied them until their death in 1882. They were afforded typical posthumous honours. Ding's successor in Taiwan, Governor Liu Mingchuan, was given more financial support, and a portion of the railway was begun from 1887-1891, while Liu's successor completed another two-thirds before it was finished in the early 1900s.
Character
Professor Jonathan K. Ocko considers Ding a Confucian moralist, prudish but also upright. They strictly adhered to their own teachings, as well as Confucian custom down to the most banal detail. Though quoted as saying "Taoism to rule the people, Legalism the clerks", they only reluctantly issued demerits, considering quick reform unreasonable and punishments impotent. They were willing to employ unlawful practices if effective or benefiting the people, for instance, in using beggars as substitutes for runners. But some of Ding's sarcasm may have been lost on magistrates that, in the first place, may have been as confused as Ding believed. They were easily perturbed by a disregard for their orders, and sensitive about the performance of officials they had personally appointed.

Langton Castle is a now destroyed medieval fortress at Langton, near the burgh of Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland. Little remains of the structure.
Originally belonging to the Viponts, the castle and its estate passed to the Cockburns in 1330 upon the marriage of Sir Alexander de Cokburne and the heiress Maria de Vipont. The castle was then the caput of the Cockburns of Langton until 1745.
From 1389 to 1396, Sir Alexander Cockburn of Langton was the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland.
In a dispute over succession to the estate, the castle was besieged by William Cockburn and their brother in law, David Home of Wedderburn in 1517. Antoine d'Arces, Sieur de la Bastie, the French deputy for Regent Albany, summoned Cockburn and Home to resolve the dispute. They in turn broke off the siege and ambushed Bastie near Preston, there they slew them and displayed their head at the Mercat cross of Duns.
Mary, Queen of Scots visited the castle in 1566.
In 1745, Cockburn of Langton was killed at the Battle of Fontenoy and the estate was bought by a Mr David Gavin in 1758, whereafter the castle and the village of Langton were demolished to make way for a new mansion house. The villagers of Langton were relocated to the new village of Gavinton. Gavin married Lady Elizabeth Maitland, daughter of James Maitland, 7th Earl of Lauderdale, their daughter Mary married John Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane whose descendant demolished the house and built a final Langton House in 1886 designed by David Bryce. This last house was demolished in 1950 and only a decorative gateway remains.

They joined the senior team the following year but was an unused substitute. Connors claimed their first senior silverware in 1943 when Cork won the Munster Senior Championship for the first time in 15 years. They won a second provincial title two years later before ending the season by lining out at left wing-back when Cork claimed the All-Ireland title after a defeat of Cavan in the final. Connors played their last game for Cork in 1948, however, their emigration to the United States saw them line out with the New York senior team.

The mourning wheatear (Oenanthe lugens) is a bird, one of 14 species of wheatear found in northern Africa and the Middle East. It is a small passerine in a group formerly classed as members of the thrush family Turdidae, but now more generally considered to be part of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.
The mourning wheatear was first described by Martin Lichtenstein in 1823. It is found in semi-desert areas in North Africa and the Middle East. It is sexually dimorphic with the females sporting more subtle plumage.
Panov (Wheatears of Palearctic, 2005) discusses the latest taxonomy for the mourning wheatear superspecies. The mourning wheatear is split from Abyssinian wheatear (Oenanthe lugubris), which is the species found south of the Sahara. The Maghreb wheatear (O. halophila) and basalt wheatear (O. warriae) were formerly considered subspecies of the mourning wheatear, but were split as distinct species by the IOC in 2021. The Egyptian populations of O. lugens are discussed in Baha El Din and Baha El Din (2000). These birds differ from halophila in exhibiting less sexual dimorphism, and displaying a prominent white wingbar, and thus are closer to the nominate race.
It has been recorded in the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

The sack (plundering) of Santiago de Compostela occurred in 968 AD, when a Viking fleet led by Gunrod entered and sacked the city of Santiago de Compostela in northern Hispania (now Spain). The attack had been encouraged by duke Richard I of Normandy. Three years later Gunrod attempted to sack the city again; however, this time their fleet was met with a powerful army and the sacking was averted.
Background
In the year 968, a Norwegian Viking fleet led by Gunrod went to help the duke Richard I of Normandy (the grandson of the Viking chieftain Rollo, first duke of Normandy), who was afraid of a possible invasion by the Carolingian king Lothair I of France. Once the Franks had been defeated, the fleet of Gunrod stayed in Normandy, becoming a threat for Richard, so the Norman duke sent the Norsemen to another place by telling them about the existence of an important pilgrimage site in the north of Hispania, Santiago de Compostela, where they could pillage a huge treasure. The fleet of Gunrod reached Galicia the same year. They crushed the Galician army, and then entered and sacked the city of Santiago de Compostela. Three years after the sack of Santiago de Compostela, Gunrod attacked Galicia again, only to find a powerful army sent to put an end to the Viking expedition.

The Bruce T. Halle Library, often simply referred to as Halle Library, is the sole library on the Eastern Michigan University campus. It includes computer labs, study spaces, the Holman Learning Center (which provides free tutoring), a distance-learning classroom, the Faculty Development Center, the IT Help Desk, a multi-media area, a theater, an auditorium, the University archives, the carillon tower, and a Cafe. It houses one of the largest collections of children's literature in the United States. The building has full wireless connectivity, as well as Automated Retrieval Collection (ARC) system, capable of housing 1 million items. While the most-used books are still on shelves, the majority of the school's books are stored within this system, which runs several stories underneath the library itself. The library is named for EMU graduate Bruce Halle, founder of Discount Tire and major benefactor.
History
Bruce T. Halle Library is the third library building in Eastern Michigan University's history. Past libraries include Old Main, R. Clyde Ford Hall, and University Library. The University Library is now the Eastern Michigan University College of Education, named Porter Hall. The first library on campus was a single room in the Old Main administration building. The first building that was dedicated as a library building was Ford Hall. Ford Hall was built in 1929 and University Library (Porter) was built in 1967. In the 1990s students began to advocate for a new library due to overcrowding. Halle Library was built on the site of the old physical plant building. The facility's Architectural Style is Post Modern. During the facility's dedication in 1998, students faculty and staff lined up between University Library (Porter Hall) and Halle Library. Participants passed books one by one between the two libraries as a poetic gesture. In 2009 the Library featured work of Jessica Park.
Facility
The 4 story library is and contains close to a million volumes split between a browsing level and an automated retrieval system (ARC). The building was designed to contain 520 computer stations, 1,500 network connections, wireless internet, and a 70-seat teleconferencing room. The computer stations are broken down into a video studio, 6 computer classrooms, and 3 large computer labs. The carillon is A computer that produces the sounds of cast bells in the clock tower. Four speakers in the tower amplify the sound . The library contains traditional collections, the University Archives, the Map Library, a periodicals collection, government documents, children's literature and a browsing collection. The building also has a 100-seat auditorium, meeting rooms, Information Technology Help desk and the Eagle Cafe/snack store. The library houses one of the largest collections of children's literature in the United States.
Automated Retrieval Collection (ARC)
The Automated Retrieval Collection (ARC) was the second of its kind to be used in a university library. The ARC system is part of a national trend towards condensed shelving and automatic access storage systems. Books that have not been checked out in ten years are placed in the ARC.
Bruce T. Halle
Bruce Halle was the Founder of Discount Tire and a graduate of EMU in 1965. When Halle enrolled in 1948 the school EMU was still the Michigan State Normal College. They served as the Chairman of Discount Tire Company, inc. until their death on January 4, 2018.

Frédéric Recordon (8 April 1811, in Rances – 26 November 1889, in Écublens) was a Swiss physician and ophthalmologist.
They studied medicine at the University of Heidelberg as a pupil of Maximilian Joseph von Chelius, then continued their education in Paris, where they attended lectures given by Frédéric Jules Sichel. In 1837 they settled in Lausanne and opened an out-patient clinic for eye patients. In 1843, with Elisabeth Jeanne de Cerjat and William Haldimand, they founded the Asile des Aveugles (Asylum for the Blind) in Lausanne, where they worked as chief physician from 1844 to 1880. In the meantime, they taught classes in forensic medicine (from 1862) and hygiene (from 1869) at the Academy of Lausanne.
From 1857 to 1884 they served as head of health services for the canton of Vaud. They were a catalyst towards the establishment of a school of pharmacy (1873), the Cery mental hospital (1873) and the new cantonal hospital at Champ-de-l'Air (1883).
In 1890 a biography was published by their former assistant, Marc Dufour, with the title Le docteur F. Recordon: 1811-1889 in the journal Revue médicale de la Suisse Romande. The thoroughfare "Avenue Frédéric Recordon" in Lausanne commemorates their name.

House of Glass is the fourth and final novel in the Buru Quartet tetralogy by the Indonesian author Pramoedya Ananta Toer. The original Indonesian edition was published in 1988 and an English translation by Max Lane was published in 1997.
The Buru Quartet follows the life of Minke, a heroic character loosely based upon pioneering journalist Tirto Adhi Soerjo. Unlike the other novels, House of Glass is not narrated by Minke. Instead, it follows the perspective of their nemesis, a self-loathing colonial official who is trying to destroy the emergent Indonesian independence movement.
Synopsis
The novel begins with Minke going into exile for five years as a punishment for criticising the government in their newspaper.  They are accompanied by Meneer (Jacques) Pangemanann, whom the Dutch colonial authorities then task to spy upon the dissident movement.
Pangemanann is a Menadonese man holding a legal status equal to that of a European. They enjoy the status and power of their colonial position, and orders their thugs and informers to attack the dissidents by spreading divisive rumours, inciting race riots, and committing torture and murder. Yet Pangemanann also recognises the rottenness of the colonial administration, and knows that their attempts to suppress the dissidents will be ultimately futile. They privately sympathise with the independence movement, and is tormented by pangs of conscience.
Despite Pangemanann's inner turmoil and their secret admiration for Minke, they nonetheless engineers the journalist's destruction. Visiting Minke's grave, they mourn over their rival.
Reception
John Morley stated that the novel provides "an illuminating, moving account of colonial psychosis", through its exploration of how Pangemanann "succumbs to the lures of power and privilege at the cost of betraying their people and, in the end, himself".

José Manuel Gallegos (October 30, 1815 – April 21, 1875) was a delegate to the US Congress from the Territory of New Mexico.
Biography
Born in Abiquiú, in what is now Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, Gallegos attended parochial schools. They studied theology at the Jesuit run College of Durango (Colegio de Durango), Republic of Mexico, graduated in 1840, and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. They served as member of the legislative assembly of what was then the territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, Republic of Mexico, from 1843 to 1846. They served as member of the first territorial council of the Territory of New Mexico in 1851.
Gallegos was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-third US Congress (March 4, 1853 – March 3, 1855). They were elected to a second term but served only briefly, March 4, 1855, to July 23, 1856, as they were succeeded by Miguel Antonio Otero (I), who had successfully contested Gallegos's election. They served as member of the territorial house of representatives 1860-1862 and served as speaker. They were an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1862 to the Thirty-eighth US Congress.
In 1862, Gallegos was made a prisoner of war by the Texas Confederate troops when they came through Santa Fe. They served as Treasurer of the New Mexico Territory in 1865 and 1866, and as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico in 1868.
Gallegos was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-second US Congress (March 4, 1871 – March 3, 1873). At the time they did not speak English and asked to be permitted a translator on the Floor of the House of Representatives, this request was denied. They were an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1872 to the Forty-third US Congress. They died in Santa Fe, and was interred there in the Catholic Cemetery.

The position was created on 10 January 1919 to manage the Royal Air Force. In 1946, the three posts of Secretary of State for War, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Secretary of State for Air became formally subordinated to that of Minister of Defence, which had itself been created in 1940 for the co-ordination of defence and security issues. On 1 April 1964, the Air Ministry was incorporated into the newly-created united Ministry of Defence, and the position of Secretary of State for Air was abolished.

A teacher by profession, they were a notable scholar, who built a library at the White House and started a literary salon. Them husband respected their political judgment, and was willing to consult them on state matters.
Early life
Abigail was possibly born in Stillwater, New York, on March 13, 1798, in Saratoga County. They were the youngest of seven children born to Reverend Lemuel Leland Powers, a Baptist minister, and the former Abigail Newland. Abigail grew up in Moravia, New York, not far from the Fillmore farm. Them father died shortly after their birth.

Education
After moving to Cayuga County, New York, by wagon train, they moved in with Cyprus Powers because of their impoverished state. Them father left behind a large library of their personal books, and they were educated by their mother from this wealth of books.

They continued to teach after marriage, making them the first First Lady to continue working after marriage.
Career
In 1814 Abigail became a part-time school teacher at the Sempronius Village school. In 1817 they became a full-time teacher and in 1819 they took on another teaching job and began to teach at the private New Hope Academy. Then, in 1824 they became a private tutor in Lisle to three of their cousins. They were then asked to open up a private school in Broome County, they opened the school, and in 1825, went back to Sempronius to teach in their original position.
Marriage and family
In 1819, they took a teaching post at the new academy in New Hope, where their oldest pupil was 19-year-old Millard Fillmore. The world of knowledge and Fillmore's steady progress in it drew them together, and gradually the relationship of teacher and student evolved into romantic attachment.
After a long courtship, Millard, aged 26, and Abigail, aged 27, were married on February 5, 1826, by the Reverend Orasius H. Smith at the home of the bride's brother Judge Powers in Moravia, New York. Without a honeymoon, they settled at East Aurora, New York. Mrs. Fillmore continued to teach school until the birth of their first child and maintained a lifelong interest in education. They shared their husband's love of books and helped build their personal library.
The Fillmores had a son and a daughter:
Millard Powers Fillmore (1828–1889)
Mary Abigail Fillmore (1832–1854)
Political spouse
Attaining prosperity at last, Fillmore bought their family a six-room house in Buffalo, New York. Enjoying comparative luxury, Abigail learned the ways of society as the wife of a member of congress. They cultivated a noted flower garden; but much of their time, as always, they spent reading. In 1847 when Fillmore was elected New York State Comptroller the family temporarily moved to Albany, New York; their children were away in boarding school and college.
In 1849, Abigail Fillmore came to Washington, D.C., as wife of the vice president. They thereby became the second lady of the United States.
First Lady of the United States
Sixteen months later, after Zachary Taylor's death at a height of sectional crisis, the Fillmores moved into the White House and they became First Lady.
Even after the period of official mourning, the social life of the Fillmore administration remained subdued. Suffering from an injured ankle that never properly healed Abigail couldn't stand for long periods of time and, pleading their delicate health, they entrusted many routine social duties to their daughter (who was known as Abby). Every Friday night the White House hosted a reception, where they had to stand for hours greeting and socializing with guests.
When Abigail first moved into the White House they were reportedly appalled at the fact that there was no library in it. With a special appropriation of $2,000 from Congress, they spent contented hours selecting books for a White House library. In the library was Shakespeare, history and geography books, and their piano, which they had taught themselves to play. They invited writers such as William Thackeray, Charles Dickens, and Washington Irving to meet with them and performance artists like Jenny Lind, essentially creating a White House literary salon. "She was reportedly a witty and even erudite conversationalist, the most intellectual of the early first ladies."
When their husband was away they missed them and wrote their letters about politics, and they would write back offering them advice and counsel on political matters. In fact, they valued their opinion so much that they reportedly never made any important decision without first consulting them Some history suggests that Abigail advised their husband not to sign the Fugitive Slave Act, which they did in the end sign, losing their nomination for a second term as Abigail predicted would happen if they signed the Act.
As First Lady, Abigail Fillmore left a legacy of women and work. As First Lady, the public was aware that they were educated and had worked as a teacher. They also knew about the library they created and that teaching is an honorable profession. Abigail paved the way for future women and future first ladies to receive an education and become teachers.
Death
Excited about their life post-presidency Abigail and Millard discussed traveling through Europe in the months coming. At the outdoor inaugural ceremonies for Franklin Pierce in 1853, they caught a cold and the next day came down with a fever, which turned into bronchitis and then developed into pneumonia. At age 55 Abigail died just 26 days after leaving the White House, on March 30, 1853, at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., the shortest post-presidential life of any former first lady. Them sudden and quick death became the most widely reported death of a first lady. They were buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York. The memorial stone was placed by the Abigail Fillmore Chapter, National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, of Buffalo.
On February 10, 1858, five years after their death, their husband married Caroline Carmichael McIntosh, a wealthy Buffalo widow. They remained married until Millard's death from a stroke on March 8, 1874 at the age of 74.

Filomena Dato Muruais (1856 - 1 May 1926) was a Spanish feminist and writer in Castilian Spanish and the Galician language. Remaining in Galicia all their life, they joined movements associated with Galician culture and to liberate women from stigmatization. Of the three poetry books published by Spanish women in the 19th-century, one was by Dato.
Biography
Filomena Dato was born in Ourense, 1856.
Little or almost nothing is known about Dato's life in a personal sense, beyond the great friendship that they established with their contemporaries Sofía Casanova and Emilia Pardo Bazán. Excluding this, most of their biographical data is related to their social and cultural work.
Dato wrote for various magazines and journals, and was awarded prizes. As with Catalan contemporaries, their early writing was in Castilian before they switched to Galician. Them poetic compositions were published in newspapers such as El Heraldo Gallego, Galicia Recreativa and Album Literario. They participated in the Rexurdimento, the literary movement that revitalized the Galician language as a means of expression, following in the likes of Valentín Lamas Carvajal.
Dato was a fervent feminist, in alignment with Rosalía de Castro. In fact, these two poets are the best representatives of the feminist lyric of 19th century Spain, in a historical context in which machismo was the dominant ideology, not only among people without cultural training, but also among intellectuals. These still asked questions such as if women had a soul, if they had conscience and remorse, or if they were the bearers of sin by inheritance from Eve, among others, being very frequent in social and philosophical debates. It was a time of adversity for women like Dato herself, Rosalía de Castro or Cecilia Böhl de Faber (Fernán Caballero), which gives them literary production greater value. The feminist claim and defense of the asupervisorstioned woman is very present in ''Follatos'' (1891), their only book in the Galician language; it was dedicated to Infanta Sabela Francisca de Borbón. The book is a compilation of forty-five poems as a complaint against gender stereotypes, in addition to including a series of writings on religiosity and intimacy, very much in the line of typical 19th century Romanticism.
Dato continued to dedicate their life to the world of literature, despite the blindness that they were acquiring, practically until their death at age 70, in A Coruña, 1 May 1926.
Awards and honours
Dato received awards in numerous literary competitions. They won three awards in 1887 for their notable poem "Defensa das mulleres", in addition to being one of the five awarded poets at the Juegos Florales de Tui in 1891.
In 1906, they were appointed a corresponding member of the Real Academia Gallega, along with other contemporaries such as Carmen Beceiro, Emilia Calé and Sofía Casanova.

John Vincent Atanasoff, , (October 4, 1903 – June 15, 1995) was an American physicist and inventor, best known for being credited with inventing the first electronic digital computer.
Atanasoff invented the first electronic digital computer in the 1930s at Iowa State College (now known as Iowa State University). Challenges to their claim were resolved in 1973 when the Honeywell v. Sperry Rand lawsuit ruled that Atanasoff was the inventor of the computer. Their special-purpose machine has come to be called the Atanasoff–Berry Computer.
Early life and education
Atanasoff was born on October 4, 1903, in Hamilton, New York to an electrical engineer and a school teacher. Atanasoff's father, Ivan Atanasov, was of Bulgarian origin, born in 1876 in the village of Boyadzhik, close to Yambol, then in the Ottoman Empire. While Atanasov was still an infant, their own father was killed by Ottoman soldiers after the Bulgarian April Uprising. In 1889, Atanasov immigrated to the United States with their uncle. Atanasoff's father later became an electrical engineer, whereas their mother, Iva Lucena Purdy (of mixed French and Irish ancestry), was a teacher of mathematics. Young Atanasoff's ambitions and intellectual pursuits were in part influenced by their parents, whose interests in the natural and applied sciences cultivated in them a sense of critical curiosity and confidence.
Atanasoff was raised in Brewster, Florida. At the age of nine they learned to use a slide rule, followed shortly by the study of logarithms, and subsequently completed high school at Mulberry High School in two years. In 1925, Atanasoff received their Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida.
They continued their education at Iowa State College and in 1926 earned a master's degree in mathematics. They completed their formal education in 1930 by earning a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with their thesis, The Dielectric Constant of Helium. Upon completion of their doctorate, Atanasoff accepted an assistant professorship at Iowa State College in mathematics and physics.
Computer development
Partly due to the drudgery of using the mechanical Monroe calculator, which was the best tool available to them while they were writing their doctoral thesis, Atanasoff began to search for faster methods of computation. At Iowa State, Atanasoff researched the use of slaved Monroe calculators and IBM tabulators for scientific problems, with which controlled the Monroe using the output of an IBM. In 1936 they invented an analog calculator for analyzing surface geometry. At this point they were pushing the boundaries of what gears could do and the fine mechanical tolerance required for good accuracy pushed them to consider digital solutions.
With a grant of $650 received in September 1939 and the assistance of their graduate student Clifford Berry, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) was prototyped by November of that year. According to Atanasoff, several operative principles of the ABC were conceived by them during the winter of 1938 after a drive to Rock Island, Illinois.
The key ideas employed in the ABC included binary math and Boolean logic to solve up to 29 simultaneous linear equations. The ABC had no central processing unit (CPU), but was designed as an electronic device using vacuum tubes for digital computation. It also had regenerative capacitor memory that operated by a process similar to that used today in DRAM memory.
Patent dispute
Atanasoff first met John Mauchly at the December 1940 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Philadelphia, where Mauchly was demonstrating their "harmonic analyzer", an analog calculator for analysis of weather data. Atanasoff told Mauchly about their new digital device and invited them to see it.
In June 1941 Mauchly visited Atanasoff in Ames, Iowa for four days, staying as their houseguest. Atanasoff and Mauchly discussed the prototype ABC, examined it, and reviewed Atanasoff's design manuscript. In 1941 Atanasoff left Iowa State for a wartime assignment as Chief of the Acoustic Division with the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL) in Washington, D.C. No patent application for the ABC was subsequently filed by Iowa State College.
Mauchly visited Atanasoff multiple times in Washington during 1943 and discussed computing theories, but did not mention that they were working on a computer project themselves until early 1944.
By 1945 the U.S. Navy had decided to build a large scale computer, on the advice of John von Neumann. Atanasoff was put in charge of the project, and they asked Mauchly to help with job descriptions for the necessary staff. However, Atanasoff was also given the responsibility for designing acoustic systems for monitoring atomic bomb tests. That job was made the priority, and they participated in the testing at Bikini Atoll in July 1946. By the time they returned from the testing the NOL computer project was shut down due to lack of progress, again on the advice of von Neumann.
In June 1954 IBM patent attorney A. J. Etienne sought Atanasoff's help in breaking an Eckert–Mauchly patent on a revolving magnetic memory drum, having been alerted by Clifford Berry that the ABC's revolving capacitor memory drum may have constituted prior art. Atanasoff agreed to assist the attorney, but IBM ultimately entered a patent-sharing agreement with Sperry Rand, the owners of the Eckert–Mauchly memory patent, and the case was dropped.
Atanasoff was deposed and testified at trial in the later action Honeywell v. Sperry Rand. In that case's decision, Judge Earl R. Larson found that "Eckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic electronic digital computer, but instead derived that subject matter from one Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff".
Between 1954 and 1973, Atanasoff was a witness in the legal actions brought by various parties to invalidate electronic computing patents issued to Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, which were owned by computer manufacturer Sperry Rand. In the 1973 decision of Honeywell v. Sperry Rand, a federal judge named Atanasoff the inventor of the electronic digital computer.
Postwar life
Following World War II Atanasoff remained with the government and developed specialized seismographs and microbarographs for long-range explosive detection. In 1952 they founded and led the Ordnance Engineering Corporation, selling the company to Aerojet General Corporation in 1956 and becoming Aerojet's Atlantic Division president. They retired from Aerojet in 1961.
In 1960 Atanasoff and their wife Alice moved to their hilltop farm in New Market, Maryland for their retirement. In 1961 they started another company, Cybernetics Incorporated, in Frederick, Maryland which they operated for 20 years. They developed a phonetic alphabet for computers during this period of their life. They were gradually drawn into the legal disputes being contested by the fast-growing computer companies Honeywell and Sperry Rand. Following the resolution of Honeywell v. Sperry Rand, Atanasoff was warmly honored by Iowa State College, which had since become Iowa State University, and more awards followed.
Atanasoff died at the age of 91 on June 15, 1995 of a stroke at their home after a lengthy illness.  They are buried in Pine Grove Cemetery in Mount Airy, Maryland.
Heritage
Atanasoff visited Bulgaria twice, in 1975 and 1985. They visited Boyadzhik village, where their grandfather had been shot by the Ottoman Turks, and was warmly welcomed by the locals and their father's relatives. They were made an honorable citizen of the town of Yambol, and received the "Key of the Town". They were also given various titles by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. The John Atanasov prize is awarded every year in Bulgaria. The 3546 Atanasoff asteroid found at the Bulgarian astronomic observatory of Rozen, was named after him.
Honors and distinctions
Atanasoff's first national award for scientific achievements was the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius, First Class, Bulgaria's highest scientific honor bestowed to them in 1970, before the 1973 court ruling.
In 1990, President George H. W. Bush awarded Atanasoff the United States National Medal of Technology, the highest U.S. honor conferred for achievements related to technological progress.
Other distinctions awarded to Atanasoff include:
U.S. Navy Distinguished Service Award (1945)
Citation, Seismological Society of America (1947)

Birks' law (named after British physicist John B. Birks) is an empirical formula for the light yield per path length as a function of the energy loss per path length for a particle traversing a scintillator, and gives a relation that is not linear at high loss rates.
Overview
The relation is:
where L is the light yield, S is the scintillation efficiency, dE/dx is the specific energy loss of the particle per path length, k is the probability of quenching, and B is a constant of proportionality linking the local density of ionized molecules at a point along the particle's path to the specific energy loss; "Since k and B appear only as a product, they act as one parameter, kB, called Birks' coefficient, which has units of distance per energy. Its value depends on the scintillating material."
kB is 0.126 mm/MeV for polystyrene-based scintillators and 1.26–2.07 × 10−2 g MeV−1 cm−2 for polyvinyltoluene-based scintillators.
Birks speculated that the loss of linearity is due to recombination and quenching effects between the excited molecules and the surrounding substrate. Birks' law has mostly been tested for organic scintillators. Its applicability to inorganic scintillators is debated. A good discussion can be found in Particle Detectors at Accelerators: Organic scintillators. A compilation of Birks' constant for various materials can be found in Semi-empirical calculation of quenching factors for ions in scintillators. A more complete theory of scintillation saturation, that gives Birks' law when only unimolecular de-excitation is included, can be found in a paper by Blanc, Cambou, and De Laford.

Jack Ferriter is a former Gaelic footballer from Dingle, County Kerry. They were a member of several Kerry underage teams in the 1990s with Dingle CBS, Dingle GAA, and Kerry (Minor, U-21, Junior, and Senior). They were described as a 'star' and a 'teen sensation' when Kerry won an Ireland Minor title in 1994 with them as captain, and until 2014 was the last Kerry man to do so. Ferriter suffered a shoulder injury which curtailed a promising senior career with Kerry at a relatively early age.
Club
They played their club football with Dingle. They won a Kerry Intermediate Football Championship in 1997 with the club, as well as a number of West Kerry Senior Football Championship titles.
They also played with the West Kerry divisional team. They won Minor and Under 21 championships with the team, and played in the 1996 Kerry Senior Football Championship.
They later played with Bishopstown in Cork. They lined out in the 2004 Cork Senior Football Championship final when Bishopstown lost to Carbery GAA.
Ferriter has also played in the United States with Shannon Blues GAA (Boston) and St Barnabas GAA (New York).
Underage
They first played with the Kerry minor team in 1994, a team they were the captain of. Kerry won the Munster title with little fuss with Ferriter scoring in each game, wins over Limerick scored 2 pts, Cork scored 2-03 and Clare in the final scored 4 pts. They scored 4 pts in the All-Ireland semi-final win over Armagh. In the final Kerry faced Galway. Ferriter scored 6 pts as Kerry took the title on a 0–16 to 1-07 scoreline. They went on to collect the cup as the team's captain.
They moved on to the counties Under 21 team in 1995. They were a sub during the Munster championship, as Kerry won the title by beating Waterford in final. They started at Left Half Forward in the All-Ireland semi-final win over Donegal. In the final Kerry faced Mayo. The sides ended level 2–12 to 3-09 and a replay was needed. In the second game Ferriter was Man of the Match after scoring 1–01 in a 3–10 to 1–12 win. This gave them an All-Ireland Under 21 medal.
Injury saw them miss much of Kerry's 1996 campaign. Their only appearance was when they came on as a sub in the All-Ireland final win against Cavan. It was their second Under 21 All-Ireland medal.
They were still underage in 1997 but missed the whole campaign.
Colleges
They also played on the Tralee IT teams that won Sigerson Cups in 1998 and 1999. Ferriter was awarded the Player of the Tournament in the Sigerson Cup competition of 1998 as the collage made it three titles in a row.
Junior
Having played with the senior team during the later 90's they had fallen out of favor. They joined the Kerry junior team in 2001. Kerry had a surprise loss to Tipperary.
They were again part of the junior team in 2002. They played at Center Forward as Kerry beat Limerick, Cork and Tipperary to win the Munster title. They scored 1-05 as Kerry overcame Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final. They lined out in their first All-Ireland final since their Under 21 days when Kerry faced Wicklow. While Kerry were expected to win, Wicklow scored four goals in a surprise win. The final was their last game with Kerry at any level.
Senior
On the back of their displays with the Under 21's Ferriter was brought into the Kerry senior panel for the 1995/96 National League. They played in all six of Kerry's game, including the quarter-final loss to Cork. They played no part in that summers championship.
Injury saw them miss out on the whole of the 1997 season.
They returned to make an appearance during the 1997/98 League. They were part of the panel during the championship, winning a Munster championship title as a sub, but played no games.
They again played during the 1998/99 National League playing four games. This was their last time playing with Kerry at senior level.
They were linked with joining Cavan, Galway and Cork at different times but never played championship football.

The Weeden House Museum is a historic two-story house in Huntsville, Alabama. It was built in 1819 for Henry C. Bradford, and designed in the Federal architectural style. Until 1845, it was sold and purchased by several homeowners, including John McKinley, who served as a Congressman, Senator, and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. From 1845 to 1956, it belonged to the Weeden family. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, the Union Army took over the house while the Weedens moved to Tuskegee; they moved back in after the war. Portraitist and poet Maria Howard Weeden spent most of their life in the house. After it was sold by the Weeden family in 1956, the house was remodelled into residential apartments. In 1973, it was purchased by the city of Huntsville and the Twickenham Historic Preservation District Association restored it before they acquired it from the city. The private residence became a house museum in 1981.

Meuse TGV is a railway station that opened in June 2007 along with the LGV Est, a TGV high-speed rail line from Paris to Strasbourg. It is located in Les Trois-Domaines, about 30 km from Verdun and Bar-le-Duc, France. Designed by Jean-Marie Duthilleul, director of architecture for the SNCF, it is the first timber-built station in France since Abbeville in 1856.
On 14 November 2015, a test train performing commissioning tests on the second phase of the LGV Est left Meuse TGV station headed to Strasbourg, but it derailed at a bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal resulting in 11 deaths.

The Premiolino is the oldest
and one of the most important
Italian journalism awards. It is made annually to six journalists from print media and television for their career achievements and their contributions to the freedom of the press.
History
The prize was founded in Milan in 1960 by a group of special correspondents including Gaetano Tumiati, Orio Vergani, Paolo Monelli, Luigi Barzini, Jr., Indro Montanelli, Enrico Emanuelle, and Enzo Biagi, the jury chairperson.
The first year the prize was sponsored by Reader's Digest, but replaced the following year by Bassetti.
In 1961, the prize took its present name, which involves a play on words. ‘Premiolino' can be translated as little prize (or ‘prizelet'), the diminutive suffix ‘lino' intended to convey the award's unpretentious nature; but ‘lino' also means ‘linen' and refers to the sponsor's household linen range. The value of the prize was 200,000 lire, a remarkable sum when the prize was founded, but one which remained unchanged for nearly two decades despite inflation. Initially, the prize was awarded to the "Journalist of the Month" and was delivered every three months.
Bassetti remained the sponsor for 23 years, before being replaced by Parmalat in the 1980s, which established the "Journalist of the Year" and "Best Journalist of Europe" awards.
Since 2007, the prize sponsor has been Birra Moretti.
Awards
Eleven awards were made in 1960, the first year of the Premiolino. The winners were Achille Patitucci (Corriere della Sera), Arturo Carlo Jemolo (La Stampa), Vittorio Notarnicola (Corriere d'Informazione), Felice Chilanti (Paese Sera), Eugenio Ferdinando Palmieri (La Notte), Giuseppe Signori (Il Campione), Sennuccio Benelli (Tempo settimanale), Mauro De Mauro (Settimo Giorno), Enzo Forcella (Il Giorno), Gianni Granzotto (Rai tv) and Aldo Chiappelli (L'Espresso)
Over the following half century the Premiolino has been awarded both to nationally celebrated journalists and writers, and to those less known who work on local newspapers. Among the most celebrated recipients of the prize have been Sergio Zavoli, Giorgio Bocca, Camilla Cederna, Oriana Fallaci, Alberto Moravia, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Alberto Ronchey and Roberto Saviano.
In 2009 awards were made under five categories. Roberto Saviano of L'Espresso received the award for journalists working on weeklies, Massimo Bordin (Radio Radicale) for radio, Emilio Carelli (Sky Tg 24) for television, Gianni Dragoni (Il Sole 24 Ore) and Simonetta Fiori (La Repubblica) for the dailies, and the Italian Wikipedia under the new media category.

The Great Northern Railway (GNR) Class O1 was a class of two-cylinder 2-8-0 steam locomotive designed by Nigel Gresley for heavy freight work and built by the GNR between 1913 and 1919.
History
Gresley designed the O1 2-8-0 for the heavy coal trains on the mainline from Grantham to London, ordering five examples 1913, which were completed at Doncaster in 1914. A further fifteen were ordered in January 1916, but due to the First World War delays were incurred and construction was transferred to the North British Locomotive Company, who delivered the first ten in April 1918, followed by a further five in October and November 1919.
The class was re-designated O3 by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1944.
British Railways
Seventeen examples survived into British Railways ownership in 1948, but all had been withdrawn by 1952.

Daniel Waters (June 20, 1731 – March 26, 1816) was an officer in the Continental Navy and in the United States Navy.
Biography
They were born on June 20, 1731, in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and was one of the "minutemen" who engaged the British at the onset of the American Revolutionary War. Later placed in charge of a small gunboat during the siege of British troops in Boston, Waters was appointed by General George Washington to command the schooner Lee on January 20, 1776. They were soon actively engaged in the ensuing assault upon British communications, capturing one enemy vessel in February and another in May. Aided by Warren, Lee seized an armed troopship with 94 Scottish Highlander troops on board in early June. Later in the month, Waters and Lee shared with other vessels the capture of transports Howe and Annabella.
Again at the recommendation of Washington, Waters was appointed a captain in the Continental Navy on March 15, 1777, and given command of the frigate Fox. Shortly thereafter, Waters and Fox, along with Hancock, were forced to surrender to superior British forces off Halifax, Nova Scotia. Following an exchange in 1778, Waters made a cruise to the West Indies in the spring of 1779 in the Continental sloop General Gates. They then commanded the Massachusetts ship General Putnam in an ill-fated expedition against Castine, Maine, in which the American ships were destroyed in the mouth of the Penobscot River to prevent their capture .
Waters' most famous exploit occurred on Christmas Day, 1779, when they led the Boston privateer Thorn in a successful, two-hour action against two enemy privateers of about equal armament, but more heavily manned. In the fierce fight, during which Governor William Tryon and Sir William Erskine were captured, Waters was wounded. John Adams was to write of this engagement: "There has not been a more memorable action this war."
Waters' last cruise was in the Massachusetts privateer Friendship, to which they were appointed in January 1781. Following the war, Waters retired to their farm in Malden, Massachusetts, where they died on March 26, 1816.
Namesake
USS Waters (DD-115) was named for him.

The Taqwacores is the debut novel by Michael Muhammad Knight, depicting a fictitious Islamic punk rock scene. The title is a portmanteau of taqwa, an Islamic concept of love and fear for Allah, and Hardcore, the punk rock subgenre. Some of the most popular taqwacore bands are: The Kominas, Al-Thawra, Secret Trial Five, and Fedayeen.
Knight originally self-published The Taqwacores in DIY zine format, giving copies away for free until finding distribution with Alternative Tentacles, the punk record label founded by Jello Biafra. After receiving an endorsement from Peter Lamborn Wilson (aka Hakim Bey), the novel was published by radical press Autonomedia. A UK version is published by Telegram Books. In its Italian translation, the novel is retitled Islampunk.
The narrator of The Taqwacores, Yusuf Ali, is a Pakistani American engineering student from Syracuse, New York, who lives off campus with a diverse group of Muslims in their house in Buffalo. Besides being their home, the house serves as a place to have punk parties and a place for Muslims not comfortable with the Muslim Student Association or local mosques to have Friday prayer.
The book also inspired a documentary entitled Taqwacore: The Birth of Punk Islam, directed by Omar Majeed, which follows author Michael Muhammad Knight and several Taqwacore bands across the United States. It was released in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, at the Cinéma du Parc on October 19, 2009.
Soft Skull Press is publishing the revised edition, which became available in December 2008.
Censorship
Due to the Danish Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, the UK edition of The Taqwacores was partially censored.
Film
A feature film adaptation of The Taqwacores directed by Eyad Zahra premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. also titled The Taqwacores (film)
Cultural impacts
Asra Nomani credited the novel as first presenting them with the idea for woman-led prayer, leading to a widely reported woman-led congregation on March 18, 2005 with Amina Wadud acting as imam.

Potamididae, common name potamidids (also known as horn snails or mudwhelks) are a family of small to large brackish water snails that live on mud flats, mangroves and similar habitats. They are amphibious gastropod molluscs in the superfamily Cerithioidea.
Traditionally, potamidids and batillariids have been confused because they have similar shells and they live in similar environments. For many fossil taxa the family assignment to either of these two families is still unresolved or controversial.
According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) the family Potamididae has no subfamilies.
Distribution
The distribution of Potamididae includes the Indo-West Pacific, the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean.

Six living and a number of fossil genera are currently recognized:
Recent genera:

Jeremiah O'Rourke, FAIA, (1833 – 1915), was an Irish-American architect known primarily for their designs of Roman Catholic churches and institutions and Federal post offices. They were a founder of the Newark-based architectural firms of Jeremiah O'Rourke (active from the 1850s to the 1880s) and Jeremiah O'Rourke & Sons (active from the 1880s until their death).
Early life
O'Rourke was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1833 as one of eight children and graduated in 1850 from the Government School of Design, Queens College, Cork. They thereafter emigrated to the United States where they found work drafting plans for a Newark carpenter-builder, Jonathan Nichols. They married Elizabeth Cecilia Dunn in 1860. They lived at a home they designed and built at 45 Burnet Street in what is now the James Street Commons Historic District.
In 1870, in anticipation of erecting a cathedral, James Roosevelt Bayley, Bishop of Newark, sent O'Rourke and Monsignor George Hobart Doane on a tour of England and France to study European churches.
Architecture
They set up their architectural firm in Newark, New Jersey, where they were Patrick Charles Keely's chief "competitor for Roman Catholic church and institutional commissions in metropolitan New York and northern New Jersey."
They became a member and Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1886.
O'Rourke was appointed from April 1893 to September 1894 to the office of the United States Supervising Architect in Washington, D.C. during the presidency of Grover Cleveland on the recommendation of both New Jersey senators. Succeeding W. J. Edbrooke of Chicago in this job, O'Rourke's designed several federal post offices with their annual salary of $4,500 (about $130,000 in 2020 adjusted for inflation).
They returned in 1894 to private practice, founding Jeremiah O'Rourke & Sons in Newark and New York City with sons William P. O'Rourke, Joseph B. O'Rourke, and Louis J. O'Rourke. O'Rourke and their sons specialized in ecclesiastical designs.
O'Rourke died April 22, 1915 in Newark.
Selected works
Churches
St. John's in Orange, New Jersey: a Gothic Revival and English Gothic church, with some French Gothic Details); completed 1868 with a spire. When interviewed by a New York newspaper reporter shortly before they died in 1915, O'Rourke commented that St. John's was their favorite design.
St. Joseph's, Rectory, and School in Newark: Cornerstone laid in 1872; later closed and converted into clinic offices and the home of the Priory Restaurant
St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Wharton, New Jersey
St. Mary's in Plainfield, New Jersey: cornerstone laid November 18, 1875 and dedicated September 8, 1880; red brick structure with ornamental details in white brick, black brick, and gargoyles on tower
Church of St. Paul the Apostle in Manhattan built from 1876 to 1884
St. Michael's Church in Newark: cornerstone laid April 24, 1878
St. Aloysius Church in Newark: cornerstone laid June 20, 1880. Brownstone measures 132 by 60 feet at the base, internal ceiling with oak panel finish. Construction cost about $45,000.
Holy Cross Church in Harrison, New Jersey: cornerstone laid in 1886. A cathedral-like structure in brownstone with virtually intact interior. The side porches are additions, while the planned spires were never added.
St. Anthony's near downtown Jersey City, New Jersey: built 1892
Sacred Heart in Bloomfield, New Jersey: dedicated October 16, 1892
Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark: cornerstone laid 1899 and dedicated 1954. O'Rourke acted as the primary architect from 1899 to 1910. This was the largest project of their career and is now the fifth-largest cathedral in North America, the largest in New Jersey, and the home of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. In keeping with O'Rourke's Catholic and Irish heritage, the original design called for an English-Irish Gothic Revival church, but plans were later modified in favor of a French Gothic Revival style. Among other firsts, this is the only cathedral in North America with twin towers on the front facade that are rotated 45 degrees against building's main orientation.
St. Patrick's Pro-Cathedral Rectory adjacent to the Pro-Cathedral on Washington Street and Central Avenue in the Tudor Gothic style with renovated interior. St. Patrick's was the home of Newark's archdiocese before work began on Sacred Heart.
Church of the Immaculate Conception in Camden, New Jersey: completed 1953. The building is now the cathedral of the Diocese of Camden.
Post Offices
Old United States Courthouse and Post Office in Duluth, Minnesota: built 1894 with six stories
Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington, D.C.'s Federal Triangle: built 1899 with 12 stories
Old Post Office in Buffalo, New York: built 1901 with five stories
Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, Savannah, Georgia
Institutional
Saint Michael's Hospital in Newark: built with a Gothic Revival chapel. In expectation of municipal funding, the Newark Archdiocese intended O'Rourke's project to be Newark's public hospital. Staffed for over one hundred years by Franciscan nuns, it was funded through donations from the city's Catholic community. The laying of its cornerstone was allegedly a uniquely early moment of racial unity when blacks and whites marched together in procession.
The Immaculate Conception Chapel at Seton Hall University was completely restored internally and externally. The interior is intricately detailed with an exposed hammer-beam roof and colorfully painted motifs
Warren Street School in Newark, built 1891, expanded 1908. A three-story brick school with limestone trim, slate roof, and cast terracotta details. Joel Bloom, president of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, demolished this landmark for the campus expansion.
Columbus Hall in Orange, NJ: Built 1893 in a generally neo-Renaissance style; constructed of buff-colored brick with stone belt courses and ornamental terracotta trim. Built as the home of St. John's School, it included a fully equipped theater.
Hotel Lorraine at 545 5th Avenue in Manhattan: completed by 1930 with 13 stories

Angelika Speitel (born 12 February 1952) is a former member of the West German terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF).
Life
Speitel worked as a clerk in the office of lawyer Klaus Croissant, alongside their husband Volker Speitel (who was also an RAF terrorist). During this time they helped form an information system of communication between many imprisoned terrorists across Germany. Volker went underground in 1974, and Angelika followed suit when they were suspected of involvement in the Jürgen Ponto murder in 1977.
They became an active member of the second generation RAF, taking part in bank robberies and was suspected to have been directly involved with the Hanns-Martin Schleyer kidnap-murder.
In a forest in Dortmund, on 24 September 1978, Speitel was involved in target practice with some other RAF members (Michael Knoll and Werner Lotze) when they were ambushed by police. A shoot-out followed where one police officer (Hans-Wilhelm Hans) was shot dead, and Speitel and Knoll were both shot down and arrested. Lotze managed to escape, and Knoll later died of their injuries.
Imprisonment and release
Subsequently, Speitel was charged with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment by a Düsseldorf court. During their incarceration they attempted suicide by hanging and cutting their wrists, but they survived. In 1989, they were pardoned by Federal President Richard von Weizsäcker, and released from prison.

Fernando Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja (30 July 1879 – 5 August 1921) was a Spanish soldier, brother of the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja and uncle of Falange's founder José Antonio Primo de Rivera.
Early life and career
Fernando Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja was born in Jeréz de la Frontera on 30 July 1879. They entered the Cavalry School in Valladolid in 1898, excelling at both riding and fencing. They completed their training in the French Cavalry School in Saumur.
In 1909 they married María Cobo de Guzmán.
Moroccan War
After various postings on the Spanish Mainland and being promoted to Captain, they were ordered to Melilla, commanding the 2nd Taxdirt hunters squadron. They received a commendation for the Cross of Military Merit for their actions in battle. In the same year, after taking the village of Ulad Garen, they were promoted to Commander and awarded the Cross of María Cristina. Like their brother Miguel, Fernando criticised the Spanish intervention in Morocco.
Disaster of Annual
In 1920, by then lieutenant colonel, they were sent to the Cavalry Hunter Regiment of Alcántara nº 14 as second commander. It was then that the so-called Disaster of Annual occurred. On 22 July 1921, Primo de Rivera had deployed the regiment's four sabre squadrons and its machine gun squadron (461 men: 22 officers and 439 troops) behind Izumar. The Regiment's commander, colonel Francisco Manella Corrales, had moved to Annual three days earlier to relieve colonel Argüelles.
The following day, Primo de Rivera, following orders received and leading their 2nd squadron, two sections of the 4th and one of the 1st regiment of Alcántara, with a total of 192 riders, provided cover to the Spanish forces' retreat from Chaif towards Dar Drius and subsequently towards Batel. During the retreat, their regiment repeatedly charges against the Riffian fighters, sustaining heavy losses. The charges during the crossing of the river Ighane resulted in the loss of most of the horses, the soldiers having to continue charging on foot. In the end, the Cavalry Hunter Regiment of Alcántara lost 28 of its 32 officers and 523 of its 685 troops in the battle.
Death
Primo de Rivera was killed during the siege of Monte-Arruit on 6 August having been wounded by an enemy grenade shell while observing the cannon fire from the parapet. Their arm had to be amputated without anaesthesia due to the scarcity of resources available at their position and they succumbed shortly after to gangrene. For their actions in battle, Primo de Rivera was commended for the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand, awarded posthumously in 1923.

Daud Khan Karrani (died on 12 July 1576) was the last ruler of Bengal's Karrani dynasty as well as the final Sultan of Bengal, reigning from 1572 to 1576. During the reign of their father Sulaiman Khan Karrani, Daud commanded a massive army of 40,000 cavalry, 3,600 elephants, 140,000 infantry and 200 cannons.
Mughal-Bengali war
Daud Khan was discontented to be under the dominion of Mughal Emperor Akbar, therefore they decided to fight against the army of Delhi and remain the conqueror of Bengal.
Invasion of Jamania
Emperor Akbar evaded Daud Khan once Daud invaded Jamania near Ghazipur. The Bengali army razed the Jamania city to the ground and captured its fort. Following this, Akbar finally ordered the governor of Jaunpur, Munim Khan, to proceed against Daud. Munim Khan met their friend Ludi Khan, the Prime Minister of Daud, in Patna and opted for a truce.
The agreement pleased neither Akbar nor Daud. Ludi Khan was later put to death by Daud.
Battle of Patna
In 1573 Munim Khan attacked Bihar, forcing Daud to retreat and take shelter in Patna. Daud sent Katlu Lohani, Gujar Khan Karrani and Sri Hari against the Mughal army. Munim Khan, along with Todar Mal and Mansingh, made the first attack in Hajipur. After a fierce battle, the Bengalis and Afghans were at the verge of victory. However, Akbar then re-captured the neighboring fort of Hajipur, which was the source of rations for the army of their opponent. The Bengalis along with the Afghans fell in distress and retreated to Bengal. Akbar returned to the capital after appointing Munim Khan as the governor of Bihar and Bengal. Todar Mal was also left to assist him.
Battle of Tukaroi
On 3 March 1575 a fierce battle was fought between the Mughals and the Afghans in Tukaroi. The result was a draw and the Afghans retreated to Katak, Orissa. The Mughals captured Tanda, the Afghan capital of Bengal. Munim Khan transferred the capital of Bengal from Tanda to Gaur. In the treaty of Katak, Daud ceded Bengal and Bihar to the Mughals. But they retained only Orissa as their possession. Six months later a plague broke out, and Munim Khan suddenly died in October 1575. The Mughal army was forced to retreat from Eastern Bengal by Kalapahar and Isa Khan. Daud marched from Orissa to successfully re-capture Gaur.
Battle of Rajmahal
Akbar sent a new army under the command of Khan Jahan Quli to face their formidable foe Daud Khan. They captured Teliagarhi and advanced towards Rajmahal. The two armies met in the battlefield of Rajmahal. The battle went on for many days. As the fight was getting too difficult for Akbar, they requested the governor of Bihar, Muzaffar Khan Turbati and other generals to join him. On the other side Daud was accompanied by other principal Afghan leaders like Junaid, Qutlu Khan and Ismail Khan Lodhi. After a fierce battle on 12 July 1576 Daud was finally defeated and executed.
After their death, Bengal went under direct Mughal rule as Subah with Subahdars being installed.

Alejandro Vicente López y Planes (May 3, 1785 – October 10, 1856) was an Argentine writer and politician who acted as interim President of Argentina from July 7 to August 18, 1827. They also wrote the lyrics of the Argentine National Anthem adopted on May 11, 1813.
Early life
López began their primary studies in the San Francisco School, and later studied in the Real Colegio San Carlos, today the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. They obtained a doctorate of laws in the University of Chuquisaca. They served as a captain in the Patriotic Regiment during the English invasions. After the Argentine victory they composed a poem entitled El triunfo argentino (The Argentine Triumph).
Political life
They participated in the Cabildo Abierto of May 22, 1810, and supported the formation of the Primera Junta. They had good relations with Manuel Belgrano. When the royalist members of the city government of Buenos Aires were expelled, they were elected mayor of the city; they were an enemy of the party of Cornelio Saavedra and one of the creators of the First Triumvirate, of which they were the Treasurer.
Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, they were a freemason.
López was a member of the Constituent Assembly of year XIII, representing Buenos Aires. At the request of the Assembly, they wrote the lyrics to a "patriotic march", which eventually became the Argentine National Anthem. It was a military march, whose music was composed by the Catalan Blas Parera; it was approved on March 11, 1813. The first public reading was at a tertulia on May 7 in the house of Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson. It displaced a different march, written by Esteban de Luca, which would have been the anthem if not for the more militaristic Lopez.
López participated in the government of Carlos María de Alvear, and with their fall they were sent to prison. They held a few more public offices, and was then named Secretary of the Constituent Congress of 1825, and, a little later, minister for the president Bernardino Rivadavia.
After the scandal of negotiations with the Brazilian Empire, Rivadavia resigned the presidency. In their place, López was elected as caretaker, signing the dissolution of the Congress and calling elections in Buenos Aires. The new governor, Manuel Dorrego took charge of the ministry; this unified the federalists. When Dorrego fell from grace and was executed by firing squad by Juan Lavalle, Lopez was exiled to Uruguay.
Late years
They returned in 1830 as a member of the Tribunal of Justice for Juan Manuel de Rosas. They were president of the Tribunal for many years and, among other things, presided over the judgement of the assassins of Juan Facundo Quiroga.
They were president of the literary salon led by Marcos Sastre, but was not part of the group known as the Generation of '37, to which belonged their two sons, Vicente Fidel López and Lucio Vicente López.

Emmi Pikler (born 9 January 1902 in Vienna; died 6 June 1984 in Budapest, birth name Emilie Madleine Reich) was a Hungarian pediatrician who introduced new theories of infant education, and put them into practice at an orphanage they ran.
Life
Emmi Pikler was born in 1902 and spent their early childhood in Vienna. They were the only child of a Viennese kindergarten teacher and a Hungarian craftsman. In 1908 their parents moved to Budapest. When Pikler was 12 years old, their mother died.
Pikler returned to Vienna to study Medicine, and received their medical degree in 1927. Them pediatric training was at the Vienna University Children's Hospital by Clemens von Pirquet and Pikler studied pediatric surgery under Hans Salzer.
Pikler's husband was a mathematician and educator whose experiences aligned with their own perspective on developmental physiology. They decided together with the birth of their first child to allow the child freedom of movement and to await their development patiently, with the goal of promoting their healthy development. Pikler's experience with their daughter helped build their perspective that a child must be stimulated to movement and to games and that every detail in dealing with a child and their environment is important.
At first the family lived in Trieste, and later in Budapest.
In 1935 Pikler qualified as a pediatrician in Hungary. Pikler wrote and gave lectures about the care and upbringing of infants and young children. They published their first book for parents in 1940 and it went through several editions in Hungary and other countries.
The ten years that they worked as a family doctor were difficult. Pikler's family was Jewish and their husband was imprisoned for political reasons from 1936 to 1945. With the help of the parents of the children they cared for, Pikler and their family survived the persecution of Jews during World War II.
After the war they gave birth to two more children. They did not open their private practice again, but worked for a national association for abandoned and malnourished children. In addition to other activities, they founded the Lóczy orphanage (named after the street where it was located) in 1946, which they headed until 1979. They sought to establish a comforting atmosphere, including careful selection of the staff, to allow children at the orphanage to grow up without the usual institutional damage.
Elsa Gindler and Henry Jacoby found in the 1920s that it was essential to understand the natural path of child development in order to allow the child's initial skills and powers to develop. Gindler and Jacoby explained that traditional infant and early childhood education damaged the initiative of children and stunted their development.
In 1946 Pikler founded the Lóczy Institute in Budapest. Under their leadership, and by the publication of books and scientific publications, an internationally known institution developed that is now managed by Pikler's daughter, child psychologist Anna Tardos. After Pikler retired in 1978, they continued their scientific and consultative work in Lóczy. In 1984 Pikler died after a short but severe illness.
Pikler's methods of raising infants and young children have been popularized in the United States by their student Magda Gerber.

Frederick Hamilton March, (6 August 1891 – 30 October 1977) was an Australian soldier and adventurer. They served in the Middle East during the First World War. They received the Empire Gallantry Medal, then the highest civilian gallantry award in the British Empire, for their conduct during the assassination of the Governor-General of Sudan, Sir Lee Stack. They were involved with the Sudanese Ministry of Agriculture during their later working career.
Early life and First World War
March was born at Bowning, New South Wales. Their parents were from Gundaroo. They claimed that they ran away from their home, and stowed away on a ship sailing from Sydney to San Francisco. In the United States, they worked with General Motors in Detroit, Michigan. Before the First World War, they returned to New South Wales. They were employed as a picture show man. They also ran hire cars at Moss Vale.
When the First World War started, March enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in September 1915, giving their occupation as chauffeur. They served in the Middle East with the 7th Light Horse Regiment. They were discharged from the AIF in 1919 in Egypt, having achieved the rank of sergeant. After the war, they never returned to their home country.
Post-war career
March worked as a chauffeur to Sir Lee Stack, the Governor-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. On 19 November 1924, Stack was shot and assassinated. March was also wounded, but they evaded a second hail of bullets by skillful driving. They were awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM) from King George V. On the publication of the warrant creating the George Cross (GC) by King George VI, in January 1941, all holders of the EGM were instructed to return that medal, and it was replaced by the GC. They received compensation money for their wounds, and they bought a garage in Cairo with that money.
March worked on military road-building projects in Sinai and Palestine in the Second World War. They lost contact with their family after the death of their mother in 1948. They were involved with the Sudanese Ministry of Agriculture for the rest of their working life. They received the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977. They died on 30 October 1977. They were buried in the Christian cemetery in Khartoum. In 1978, they were reburied in the adjacent Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery at the insistence of the Returned and Services League of Australia.

In Māori mythology, the Ponaturi are a group of hostile creatures (goblins) who live in a land beneath the sea by day, returning to shore each evening to sleep. They dread daylight, which is fatal to them. They appear in a number of stories, including:
a story of Tāwhaki. The Ponaturi kill Tāwhaki's father Hemā, and carry their body away. They also capture Urutonga, Tāwhaki's mother, whom they put to work as the doorkeeper of their house Manawa-Tāne. In revenge, Tāwhaki and Urutonga block up all the holes of the house to make the Ponaturi think that it is still night. They then suddenly let in the rays of the sun, and all the dreadful creatures are destroyed (Tregear 1891:206, 350).
a story of the hero Rātā. The Ponaturi carry off their father's bones and use them to beat time when as they practice their magical arts. Rātā hides himself, learns their incantations, and recites a more powerful spell called Titikura. They then attacks them, kills their priests, and recaptures their father's bones. The Ponaturi regroup and chase Rātā, but with the aid of their warriors and their powerful incantations they defeat and kills a thousand of them (Tregear 1891:350).
Kanae
The kanae (or grey mullet) is represented as a companion of the Ponaturi in another version of Tāwhaki (Grey 1956:51). When the Ponaturi come up out of the water to their house Manawa-Tāne, Kanae comes with them. Tāwhaki and Karihi kill all the Ponaturi, in revenge for the death of Hemā, but the mullet escapes by leaping again and again until it gets back to the sea (Craig 1989:99, Grey 1855:40, Tregear 1891:122).
In the story of Ruapupuke (or Rua-te-pupuke), the kanae is associated with similar creatures, the horde of Tangaroa, which are not overtly named as Ponaturi:
Ruapupuke is a chief who lives by the sea. Ruapupuke's young son is drowned. Tangaroa takes the child to the bottom of the sea and makes them into a tekoteko (carved figure) on the ridge-pole of their house, above the door. The father dives to the bottom of the sea, and finds the house, but it is empty. They meet Hinematikotai, a woman who tells them that the inhabitants will return at sunset to sleep, and that if they let in the daylight it will kill them. So the inhabitants are killed, and Ruapupuke burns the house, taking some of the carvings back with them to use as a model for carving in the human world (Tregear 1891:350)

John Anderson (born 28 November 1931) is a Scottish television personality best known as referee and official trainer on the UK television show Gladiators. Anderson has previously worked as a teacher and coach for Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games athletes.
Career
Anderson had a successful career long before their athletics and TV fame. Plaudits included representing Scotland as a schoolboy footballer, becoming the first home Scot to gain the prestigious Full FA Coaching Certificate (then only four were awarded per year), being one of only two confirmed recipients (along with Wilf Paish) of every British Senior Coaching award available, and founding Maryhill Ladies AC in Glasgow.
Anderson coached Commonwealth Games champion and former World Record Holder David Moorcroft, The partnership started in 1966. It was a coach-athlete relationship which would lead to a world record for 5000m in 1982 and even a vets world record for the Mile of 4:02 a decade later, in 1993. Anderson also coached three-time Olympic heptathlete Judy Simpson (known as Nightshade on Gladiators); double Olympian Sheila Carey; marathoner John Graham; 1988 Olympic 10,000m silver medallist Liz McColgan; middle-distance runner Lynne MacDougall; 1972 Olympic 4×400m silver medallist David Jenkins, and sprint hurdler David Wilson.
Anderson was National Coach for the Amateur Athletics Association of England and subsequently the first full-time National Coach in Scotland (1965-1970). They were coach to an Olympian at every Olympics from 1964 to 2000 and has coached five world record holders and an estimated 170 GB Internationals in every Track and Field event.
Anderson was the head official on sports game show Gladiators from 1992–2000. Before every event they called: "Contender ready! Gladiator ready!" followed by "Three! Two! One!" before starting the game. In 2008, Anderson briefly reprised their role as referee on the newly revived Gladiators before leaving due to their retirement from TV refereeing, and being replaced by John Coyle after just one series. The series was subsequently not renewed any further. Anderson occasionally appears in cameo roles as a referee, including guest appearances on two episodes of 2016's Top Gear with Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc, and as an ident-voiceover for Sky's Challenge TV.
After their television career in the 1990s, Anderson went on to become a mentor and coach for a number of recent international athletes, including Great British athlete William Sharman, whom they helped transform from a decathlete to a world class sprint hurdler, and continues to coach on a small scale.

Help Yourself is the twelfth studio album by Welsh singer Tom Jones, released in November 1968 on Decca Records. The album included the title track which reached number 5 in the UK. The track topped the charts in Ireland, Germany, and spent three weeks at number on the Australian chart.
Help Yourself peaked at number 4 in the UK and number 5 on the Billboard 200 in 1969.
Reception
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes, "The infectious title track was a Top 40 hit and it helped make Help Yourself Tom Jones' first Top Ten album, but the record was weighed down by lackluster material, making the album their weakest set since A-tom-ic Jones."

Baroness Emma Orczy (full name: Emma Magdolna Rozália Mária Jozefa Borbála Orczy de Orci) (; 23 September 1865 – 12 November 1947), usually known as Baroness Orczy (the name under which they were published) or to their family and friends as Emmuska Orczy, was a Hungarian-born British novelist and playwright.  They are best known for their series of novels featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel, the alter ego of Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English fop who turns into a quick-thinking escape artist in order to save French aristocrats from "Madame Guillotine" during the French Revolution, establishing the "hero with a secret identity" in popular culture.
Opening in London's West End on 5 January 1905, The Scarlet Pimpernel became a favourite of British audiences. Some of Orczy's paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. During World War I, they formed the Women of England's Active Service League, an unofficial organisation aimed at encouraging women to persuade men to volunteer for active service in the armed forces.
Early life
Orczy was born in Tarnaörs, Heves County, Hungary. They were the daughter of the composer Baron Félix Orczy de Orci (1835–1892) and Countess Emma Wass de Szentegyed et Cege (1839–1892).
Them paternal grandfather, Baron László Orczy (1787–1880) was a royal councillor, and knight of the Sicilian order of Saint George, their paternal grandmother, Baroness Magdolna, born Magdolna Müller (1811–1879), was of Austrian origin. Them maternal grandparents were the Count Sámuel Wass de Szentegyed et Cege (1815–1879), member of the Hungarian parliament, and Rozália Eperjessy de Károlyfejérvár (1814–1884).
Emma's parents left their estate for Budapest in 1868, fearful of the threat of a peasant revolution. They lived in Budapest, Brussels, and Paris, where Emma studied music unsuccessfully. Finally, in 1880, the 14-year-old Emma and their family moved to London, England where they lodged with their countryman, Francis Pichler, at 162 Great Portland Street. Orczy attended West London School of Art and then the Heatherley School of Fine Art.
Although not destined to be a painter, it was at art school that they met a young illustrator named Henry George Montagu MacLean Barstow, the son of an English clergyman; they were married at St Marylebone parish church on 7 November 1894. It was the start of a joyful and happy marriage, which they described as "for close on half a century, one of perfect happiness and understanding, of perfect friendship and communion of thought."
Writing career
They had very little money and Orczy started to work with their husband as a translator and an illustrator to supplement their meager earnings. John Montague Orczy-Barstow, their only child, was born on 25 February 1899. They started writing soon after their birth, but their first novel, The Emperor's Candlesticks (1899), was a failure. They did, however, find a small following with a series of detective stories in the Royal Magazine. Them next novel, In Mary's Reign (1901), did better.
In 1903, they and their husband wrote The Scarlet Pimpernel, a play based on one of their short stories about an English aristocrat, Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., who rescued French aristocrats from the French Revolution. They had conceived the character while standing on a platform on the London Underground. They submitted their novelisation of the story under the same title to 12 publishers. While waiting for the decisions of these publishers, Fred Terry and Julia Neilson accepted the play for production in London's West End. Initially, it drew small audiences, but the play ran for four years in London, broke many stage records, eventually playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in Britain. It was translated and produced in other countries, and underwent several revivals. This theatrical success generated huge sales for the novel. The couple moved to Thanet, Kent.
Introducing the notion of a "hero with a secret identity" into popular culture, the Scarlet Pimpernel exhibits characteristics that would become standard superhero conventions, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit their adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a scarlet pimpernel at each of their interventions). By drawing attention to their alter ego, Blakeney hides behind their public face as a slow-thinking, foppish playboy, and they also establish a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, who aid their endeavours.
Orczy went on to write over a dozen sequels featuring Sir Percy Blakeney, their family, and the other members of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, of which the first, I Will Repay (1906), was the most popular. The last Pimpernel book, Mam'zelle Guillotine, was published in 1940. None of their three subsequent plays matched the success of The Scarlet Pimpernel. They also wrote popular mystery fiction and many adventure romances. Them Lady Molly of Scotland Yard was an early example of a female detective as the main character. Other popular detective stories featured The Old Man in the Corner, a sleuth who chiefly used logic to solve crimes. Orczy was a founding member of the Detection Club (1930).
Orczy's novels were racy, mannered melodramas and they favoured historical fiction. Critic Mary Cadogan states, "Orczy's books are highly wrought and intensely atmospheric". In The Nest of the Sparrowhawk (1909), for example, a malicious guardian in Puritan Kent tricks their beautiful, wealthy young ward into marrying them by disguising themselves as an exiled French prince. They persuade their widowed sister-in-law to abet them in this plot, in which they unwittingly disgrace one of their long-lost sons and finds the other murdered by the villain. Even though this novel had no link to The Scarlet Pimpernel other than its shared authorship, the publisher advertised it as part of "The Scarlet Pimpernel Series".
Later life
Orczy's work was so successful that they were able to buy a house in Monte Carlo, "Villa Bijou" at 19 Avenue de la Costa (since demolished), which is where they spent World War Two. They were not able to return to London until after the war. Montagu Barstow died in Monte Carlo in 1942. Finding themselves alone there and unable to travel, they wrote their memoir, Links in the Chain of Life (published 1947).
They held strong political views. Orczy was a firm believer in the superiority of the aristocracy, as well as being a supporter of British imperialism and militarism. During the First World War, Orczy formed the Women of England's Active Service League, an unofficial organisation aimed at encouraging women to persuade men to volunteer for active service in the armed forces. Them aim was to enlist 100,000 women who would pledge "to persuade every man I know to offer their service to their country". Some 20,000 women joined their organisation. Orczy was also strongly opposed to the Soviet Union.
They died in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on 12 November 1947.
Name pronunciation
Asked how to say their name, Orczy told The Literary Digest: "Or-tsey. Emmuska—a diminutive meaning "little Emma"—accent on the first syllable, the s equivalent to sh in English; thus, ."

Homo Faber () is a novel by Max Frisch, first published in Germany in 1957. The first English translation was published in Britain in 1959. The novel is written as a first-person narrative. The protagonist, Walter Faber, is a successful engineer traveling throughout Europe and the Americas on behalf of UNESCO. Their world view based on logic, probability, and technology is challenged by a series of incredible coincidences as their repressed past and chance occurrences come together to break up their severely rational, technically oriented ideology.
Plot
During the 1930s, Walter Faber, who works at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), meets the art student Hanna. The two become lovers, and one day Hanna reveals that they are pregnant. Faber asks them to marry him, but they hesitate. Faber receives an offer by Escher Wyss to work in Baghdad and they accept it; they and Hanna split up. Before their departure, Faber asks their friend Joachim to take care of Hanna, and Hanna agrees to abort their child.
In spring 1957, Faber recounts the events of their travels in America. On a flight from New York to Mexico, their plane makes a forced landing in the desert. During the following stay they meet the German Herbert, who turns out to be the brother of Joachim, Faber's friend. Faber had not heard from their friend since 1936. Faber decides to accompany Herbert, who is on their way to visiting their brother. After an odyssey through the wilderness, they reach Joachim's plantation. But Joachim has hanged himself. Herbert decides to stay behind and manage the plantation.
Faber returns to New York City, but meets up with their married mistress, Ivy. Looking to escape their relationship, Faber takes an unplanned cruise to Europe. On this journey, they meet the young woman Sabeth, with whom they fall in love. They propose to Sabeth at the end of the journey, but they are traveling with a male friend. Faber and Sabeth meet again in Paris and Faber decides to go on vacation and accompany Sabeth on a road trip through Europe, where they also start a sexual relationship. Faber even calls the trip their "honeymoon".
Because of a foreboding, they ask Sabeth for the name of their mother: Hanna. Faber still hopes that Hanna has aborted their child, but it turns out soon that Sabeth is their daughter. In Greece, where Hanna now lives, a poisonous snake bites Sabeth. They fall backwards after seeing Walter come naked out of the ocean, and is soon rushed to the hospital by Faber. There they meet their former love Hanna again. Luckily Sabeth survives the snakebite. However they suddenly die due to an untreated fracture in their skull caused by the fall. Faber feels a certain measure of guilt as they had not mentioned Sabeth falling.
Stricken by grief and stomach cancer, Faber realizes the beauty they have missed and finds redemption in Hanna. At the end of the narrative, Faber is in hospital facing an operation for their stomach cancer; they optimistically calculate the probability for their survival, and makes their last journal entry.
Characters
Walter Faber is the protagonist of Homo Faber.  They are an engineer and technologist who works for UNESCO. Born and educated in Switzerland, they now live in an apartment in New York City, but travels extensively for work throughout Europe and South America. Walter has never been married.
Sabeth, or Elisabeth, is the 20-year-old daughter of Walter and Hanna. Born in Switzerland, they believe that Joachim is their father. They speak English, German, and French.
Hanna Piper (née Landsberg) is the German-born half-Jewish mother of Sabeth. Formerly Walter's lover, they married Joachim, and then later married Herr Piper. They work at an art institute in Athens, Greece.
Joachim Henke was Walter's German born friend, who was studying to be a doctor. They married Hanna, but they separated after they refused to have any more children with him. Sabeth believes that they are their father. After separating from Hanna, Joachim joined the German army and fought in World War II; Hanna and Sabeth never saw them again. Decades later, they moved to Guatemala to run a tobacco plantation. A few weeks after arriving, they committed suicide.
Herbert Henke is Joachim's brother, who meets Walter on a plane.  They are employed by the same company that sent Joachim to Guatemala.
Ivy is Walter's married American mistress, who comes to New York once a week to see Walter and their psychiatrist.
Major themes
There are several major themes to the novel. The theme of technology as philosophy describes the belief that everything is possible and that technology allows people to control all aspects of their lives. This view is contradicted throughout the novel by events. Technical breakdowns mark key points in the story (and Walter's life) right up to the upcoming operation that they mention at the very end, which is thus implied to result in their death.
Faber's dismissal of literature and of anything to do with myths and the arts also plays into the theme of fate versus coincidence, which is preeminent in the plot. Faber is oblivious to the various mythological motifs and twists which bring their story close to a modern tragedy, even as it unfolds in Greece and Rome of all places. Also, the events in Homo Faber are presented in such a way as to seem either a string of coincidences resulting in an unlikely outcome, or a sequence of predestined actions and decisions leading to a necessary outcome. This dichotomy is reflected in a larger series of seeming antinomies: faith or reason, modern knowledge or ancient beliefs, free will or predestination. Walter never resolves this conflict.
The theme of travel plays an important role in the novel. Using many modes of transportation, Walter is constantly on the move, visiting several continents, almost a dozen countries, and dozens of cities, for business and pleasure. This constant travel underscores Walter's sense of dislocation; they have no family, no real home, and no real country. Through travel, Walter is able to avoid permanent connections, to escape responsibilities, and to remain completely unknown and unjudged.
Publication history
Homo Faber was first published in 1957 in Frankfurt, Germany by Suhrkamp Verlag. The first English edition, translated by Michael Bullock, was published in 1959 in London by Abelard-Schuman. The book has been translated into numerous languages, and has appeared in numerous editions, both in hardcover and paperback.
Adaptations
The novel was made into a 1991 film, Voyager, directed by Volker Schlöndorff, and starring Sam Shepard and Julie Delpy.

Colonel Daniel Coxe IV (1673–1739), son of Dr. Daniel Coxe, went to their father's North American lands. They lived in the American colonies from 1702 to 1716 and from 1725 until their death in 1739. After returning to England in 1716, they published an account in 1722 of their travels and a description of the area encompassed by their father's claim, entitled A Description of the English Province of Carolana, by the Spaniards called Florida, And by the French La Louisiane.
Daniel Coxe IV was appointed a member of the New Jersey Provincial Council on November 29, 1705 replacing the late Edward Hunloke. They were suspended from their duties on June 15, 1713 after having conflicts with Gov. Robert Hunter. In 1716 they were elected to the New Jersey General Assembly representing Gloucester County, and was chosen as Speaker, but was expelled from the lower house that same year.
They were appointed by the Duke of Norfolk as Provincial Grand Master of Freemasons of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in 1730. The following year, they were succeeded by William Allen.
In 1731, they claimed that they possessed superior title to that of the West Jersey Society, via a superseding deed that their father had recorded years earlier; the courts upheld Coxe's claim. Hundreds of families were forced to repurchase their own property from Col. Coxe or be forcibly evicted. The ensuing scandal was one of many injustices that inflamed American anger against the British during the years leading up the Revolutionary War. There were lawsuits and riots; Col. Coxe was burned in effigy; but to no avail. As a result, many Hopewell residents left New Jersey, either unable to pay Col. Coxe or disgusted with the colony's rampant political corruption. One group of Hopewell expatriates settled on the Yadkin River in what was then Rowan County, North Carolina. This community, the Jersey Settlement, continued to attract new settlers from the Hopewell area for several decades.

Alexander Mikhailovich Ivanov-Kramskoy (sometimes spelt: Alexandr Mikhaylovich Ivanov-Kramskoi) (in Russian: Александр Михайлович Иванов-Крамской) (26 August [September 8], 1912, Moscow – 11 April 1973, Minsk) was a Soviet classical guitarist, composer, conductor, teacher, esteemed artist of Russian Federation (1959). Their original last name was Ivanov.
Biography
They began to study violin at the Music School (currently Igumnov Music School), but after having heard Andres Segovia play in Moscow State Conservatory in 1926, they switched to six-string guitar.
In 1930, they got into October Revolution Music School to study with Peter Agafoshin (who was part of the International Union of Guitarists). They also studied composition with Nikolai Rechmensky and conducting with Konstantin Saradzhev. Later on, they continued their studies with Agafoshin in Moscow Conservatory (на курсах повышения квалификации).
They first appeared on Soviet Radio in 1932. Later on, they worked in Maly Theatre. In 1939—1945 conducted the Soviet NKVD Choir, and in 1946—1952 they conducted the folk instrument orchestra of Gosteleradio studio.
In 1939, they got the second prize at the Soviet folk instrumentalists competition. They recorded 40 LPs as a guitarist and conductor.
Ivanov-Kramskoy accompanied singers, including Nadezhda Obukhova, Ivan Kozlovsky, Alexandra Yablochkina, and also played with Beethoven and Komitas string quartets, with Leonid Kogan, Alexandre Korneyev and other famous musicians.
In 1936 Ivanov-Kramskoy wrote their first piece "Lyrical waltz for solo guitar". This waltz became extremely popular with Russian guitarists. Ivanov-Kramskoy composed over five hundred works for guitar: two concerts, sonatas, folk song arrangements, and many original pieces. Their music was used in the movie «Несрочная весна».
Ivanov-Kramskoy gave many concerts for soldiers during World War II.
When the war was over, Ivanov-Kramskoy - being the first Russian concert guitarist — had to fight for the future of classical guitar, trying to restore the class of classical guitar which was cancelled in the middle of the 30-ies.

Another Evil is a 2016 comedy horror film that was written and directed by Carson Mell. The movie had its world debut on March 12, 2016 at the South by Southwest Film Festival and stars Steve Zissis, a man who hires a ghost hunter (Mark Proksch) to rid their house of ghosts but finds that they instead wish to rid themselves of the hunter.
Synopsis
During a trip to their cabin in the woods so that the father Dan can work on their paintings, the Papadakis family experiences supernatural phenomenon that prompts them to seek out someone who can rid their house of ghosts. The first person they hire, the laid back Joey, confirms that their house is haunted by two ghosts but tells them that there is no need to get rid of them, as the ghosts are benign and the phenomenon was only them trying to make contact. Unhappy with this, Dan chooses to hire demonologist Os on the recommendation of their friend George, who claims that Os can effectively exorcise ghosts.
Dan chooses to remain in the cabin with Os, who proves to be a very eccentric person prone to over-imbibing and periodic rages fueled in part by their impending divorce. Their actions periodically make Dan uncomfortable, however the two bond one night after Os captures one of the two ghosts. Os tells Dan a story about how they caught gonorrhea from the Devil, who appeared to them as a beautiful woman, and Dan confesses that their paintings, which depict a black circle in the middle of a canvas, have no deep meaning to them despite the public claims stating otherwise. Eventually Os's actions become too much and Dan deliberately lies that the remaining ghost left the home due to Os's actions. The two celebrate by drinking aged canned wine, however the following day Os claims that the second ghost has returned. Dan admits that they lied due to Os's strange actions and states that the two are not really friends, which hurts the other man. Shortly thereafter Os comes to the conclusion that Dan accidentally opened up a portal to another realm, bringing over a demon that possessed Dan's son Jazz.
Unconvinced, Dan demands that Os leave the cabin, only to be knocked out and tied up. While they are unconscious Dan's wife Mary and son Jazz arrive at the cabin and are also captured and handcuffed. Os makes several attempts to exorcise Jazz using wind-up toys and cards featuring naked women, which bewilders Jazz, who claims that they are not possessed. Upset that they are not making any headway, Os calls a priest for advice and is advised to kill the demon inside Jazz. They choose to do so by burying Jazz alive as they had several other items during the course of the film to supposedly rid them of their power.
Left alone in the cabin, Mary and Dan witness the supposedly captured ghost wander into the room and drop the handcuff key, implying that Os is not actually able to get rid of ghosts. Now free, Dan manages to overpower Os and free their son just as the police arrive. The film ends with Dan and their family going to the hospital for care and Os in jail.

Release
Another Evil had its world premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 12, 2016. This was followed by a home video release on Blu-ray and DVD on July 18, 2017 through Dark Sky Films.
Reception
Critical reception for Another Evil has been mixed and the film holds a rating of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews. Common criticism for the film centered upon the mixture of horror and comedy, which Trace Thurman of Bloody Disgusting has stated is "one of the most difficult sub-genres to pull off" and that Another Evil did not do successfully. The performances of Zissis and Proksch were more favorably received by reviewers for outlets such as Collider and RogerEbert.com. Gareth Jones of Dread Central gave Another Evil 3 1/2 stars, noting that it wasn't as successful as the movie Creep as "the threat doesn't quite feel as prevalent here, with the film definitely erring more often on the funny side – but it remains a highly entertaining, subtly tense jaunt through genre-tinged territory and is more than deserving of your attention." Dennis Harvey of Variety was also critical, writing that "It doesn't bore, but at 90 minutes it lacks the kind of heft, hilarity or other assertive quality that render its pleasant-enough progress memorable."

Mary Ann Gibbon was the long-term mistress of Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk, from approximately 1795 until their death in 1815. They were purportedly married to them by a Catholic priest about 1796, while the Duke's second wife was still living but residing in an insane asylum since 1772.
Gibbon lived at Norfolk House in London for most of this time, but is believed to have also travelled with the Duke to Arundel Castle during their stays there. They were the mother of five of children by Duke Charles, Matthew Charles Howard-Gibbon, Edward Howard Howard-Gibbon, Mary Eliza Howard-Gibbon, Caroline Howard-Gibbon, and Richard Howard-Gibbon.

Bernard Lewis Jackson (born April 2, 1985) is a former American football player. They played college football as a quarterback at the University of Colorado at Boulder. As a junior, they were the starter for a majority of the 2006 season before losing their eligibility for academic reasons for their senior season.
High school
Jackson played quarterback for the Santiago Sharks at Santiago High School in Corona, California.
College
2003–2005
Jackson redshirted their first-year student year at Colorado, where they were a communications major. In 2004, they saw action in six games at wide receiver and punt returner with minimal statistics recorded. They dislocated their elbow during a punt return which caused them to miss three games.
In 2005, Jackson saw action in six games early in the season, mainly in spot action and as a kick returner and tailback, again recording minimal statistics.
2006
With a new head giving coach, Dan Hawkins, all positions were up for grabs (except the kicker, which Mason Crosby already had a lock on the position), especially the quarterback position with Joel Klatt's eligibility used up. James Cox, the only senior quarterback on the team and the only quarterback with career starts for experience was thought to be the favorite. But they missed all spring training with a broken thumb while their two main competitors, juniors Jackson and Brian White practiced. (Cody Hawkins, also the head coach's son, redshirted for the 2006 season.) On August 20, 2006, Coach Hawkins announced Cox would be the starting quarterback. They started the first game of the season on September 2, 2006, against Division I-AA Montana State. Colorado lost the game 19–10 in the start of the horrible season. Cox went 8–22 with no touchdowns or interceptions. Cox was surprisingly replaced as starter the following week by Jackson. Jackson remained the starter for the rest of the season.
Jackson was named as an honorable mention to the Colorado Buffaloes's all-decade team due to their excellence on and off the field.
2007
Jackson had strong competition from Cody Hawkins, Matt Ballenger, and Nick Nelson to remain the quarterback for this season. They were named one of three captains for the 2007 season prior to spring practice, where it was reported they may switch to another position. However, they were not able to remain academically eligible.
2010
Jackson played their final year of eligibility at Division II CSU–Pueblo, with 34 receptions for 453 yards. They completed their degree in 2011.
Statistics
Legal trouble
Jackson and teammate Lionel Harris were arrested on suspicion of first-degree burglary, aggravated robbery and felony menacing in connection with a June 5 robbery in an apartment in the 1000 block of University Avenue. On January 22, 2009, Jackson pleaded guilty to lesser crimes and was sentenced to 5 and one-half years in prison. On December 1, 2009, Jackson was released on probation, which would continue until late 2014.
Coaching career
From 2011 to 2014, Jackson was wide receivers coach at CSU–Pueblo.
From 2015 to 2018, Jackson has coached quarterbacks and wide receivers for Pueblo East High School.

Philip N. Howard is a sociologist and communication researcher who studies the impact of information technologies on democracy and social inequality. They study how new information technologies are used in both civic engagement and social control in countries around the world.  They are Professor of Internet Studies at the Oxford Internet Institute and Balliol College at the University of Oxford. They were Director of the Oxford Internet Institute from March 2018 to March 26, 2021.  They are the author of ten books, including New Media Campaigns and The Managed Citizen, The Digital Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, and Pax Technica: How the Internet of Things May Set Us Free or Lock Us Up. Their latest book is Lie Machines: How to Save Democracy from Troll Armies, Deceitful Robots, Junk News Operations, and Political Operatives.
Research
Their research has demonstrated that the diffusion of digital media has long-term, often positive, implications for democratic institutions. Through information infrastructure, some young democracies have become more entrenched and durable; some authoritarian regimes have made significant transitions towards democratic institutions and practices; and others have become less authoritarian and hybrid where information technologies support the work of particular actors such as state, political parties, journalists, or civil society groups.
Astroturf campaigns and fake news
Howard was one of the first to investigate the impact of digital media on political campaigning in advanced democracies, and they were the first political scientist to define and study "astroturf" political movements as the managed perception of grassroots support through astroturfing in their research on the Gore and Bush presidential campaigns. New Media Campaigns and the Managed Citizen (2005) is about how politicians and lobbyists in the United States use the internet to manipulate the public and violate privacy. Their research on technology and social change has been prescient. The subject's study of the 2016 U.S. presidential election did not identify the Russian sources of disinformation that other investigations have alluded to, though Howard later studied the disinformation campaigns launched by the Internet Research Agency.
Digital media and the Arab Spring
Howard wrote presciently about the role of the internet in transforming Political Islam, and is the author of The Digital Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (2010) which argues that how states respond to new information technologies has become a defining feature of both democracy and authoritarianism. Howard demonstrated that the internet was having an important impact on political Islam. The book was published before the Arab Spring, and shows how new social movements in North Africa and the Middle East were using social media to outmaneuver some of the region's dictators, partly because these regimes lacked effective responses to online evidence of their abuses. Using Charles Ragin's method of "qualitative comparative analysis" Howard investigated technology diffusion and political Islam and explained trends in many countries, with the exception of Tunisia and Egypt. But very shortly the trends in social activism and political Islam they had identified appeared in those two countries as well in the "Arab Spring."
Democracy's Fourth Wave? (2013), with Muzammil M. Hussain, suggests that turning off the Internet, as the Mubarak regime did on January 28, 2011, actually strengthened the revolution by forcing people into the streets to seek information. It sees events like the Arab Spring as "early signs of the next big wave of democratization. But this time, it will be wrestled into life in the digital living room of the global community." Their research and commentary is regularly featured in the media, including recent contributions about media politics in the US, Hungary and around the world the New York Times and Washington Post.
Politics and the Internet of Things
In Pax Technica (2015) they argue that the Internet of Things will be the most important tool of political communication we have ever built. They advocate for more public input in its design and more civic engagement with how this information infrastructure gets used.
Computational propaganda
In Lie Machines (2020) they surveyes the extent to which large-scale misinformation campaigns have shaped politics. They highlight the roots these developments have in propaganda but mobilizes contemporary data to argue that a host of technologies, techniques, and actors (e.g., AI bots, political activists, conspiracy theorists, national governments, and so forth) are innovating at a rapid pace. Lie Machines extends Howard's 2014 hypothesis that political elites in democracies would soon be using algorithms over social media to manipulate public opinion, a process they called "computational propaganda." Evidence from Russia, Myanmar, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and of course the United States, documented in Lie Machines and scholarly articles and policy reports, further substantiate this hypothesis.
For example, their research on political redlining, astroturf campaigns and fake news inspired a decade of work and became particularly relevant during the Brexit referendum and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign. Their research has exposed the global impact of bots and trolls on public opinion.
Impact
As Director of the Democracy and Technology Programme at the Oxford Internet Institute, Howard has contributed to more than 130 reports on computational propaganda, political communication, election interference, and the abuse of social media by politicians and foreign governments. Like fellow Canadian researcher Ronald Deibert of the Citizen Lab, Howard's work is often critical of authoritarian regimes and the use of technology for political manipulation. Howard has testified before the UK Parliament, European Commission, and US Senate on election interference.
Howard is sometimes critiqued by the subjects of their research and investigations. After a reporter presented one of the research findings from a report that Dr. Howard was listed as the Primary Investigator on, President Rodrigo Duterte said: “Oxford University? That's a school for stupid people.” Erik Wemple in The Washington Post and Elizabeth Harrington in The Washington Free Beacon argue that their research is biased against those who voted for President Donald J. Trump .

Current mode logic (CML), or source-coupled logic (SCL), is a digital design style used both for logic gates and for board-level digital signalling of digital data .
The basic principle of CML is that current from a constant current generator is steered between two alternate paths depending on whether a logic zero or logic one is being represented. Typically, the generator is connected to the two sources of a pair of differential FETs, with the two paths being their two drains. Bipolar equivalents operate similarly, with the output being taken from the collectors of the BJT transistors.
As a differential PCB-level interconnect, it is intended to transmit data at speeds between 312.5 Mbit/s and 3.125 Gbit/s across standard printed circuit boards.
The transmission is point-to-point, unidirectional, and is usually terminated at the destination with 50 Ω resistors to Vcc on both differential lines. CML is frequently used in interfaces to fiber optic components. The principle difference between CML and ECL as a link technology is the output impedance of the driver stage: the emitter follower of ECL has a low resistance of around 5 ohms whereas CML connects to the drains of the driving transistors, that have a high impedance, and so the impedance of the pull up/down network (typically 50 ohm resistive) is the effective output impedance. Having a drive impedance closer to the driven line's characteristic impedance greatly reduces undesirable ringing.
CML signals have also been found useful for connections between modules. CML is the physical layer used in DVI, HDMI and FPD-Link III video links, the interfaces between a display controller and a monitor.
In addition, CML has been widely used in high-speed integrated systems, such as telecommunication systems such as: serial data transceivers, and frequency synthesizers.
Operation
The fast operation of CML circuits is mainly due to their lower output voltage swing compared to the static CMOS circuits, as well as the very fast current switching taking place at the input differential pair transistors. One of the primary requirements of a current-mode logic circuit is that the current bias transistor must remain in the saturation region to maintain a constant current.
Ultra low power
Recently, CML has been used in ultra-low power applications. Studies show that while the leakage current in conventional static CMOS circuits is becoming a major challenge in lowering the energy dissipation, good control of CML current consumption makes them a very good candidate for extremely low power use. Called subthreshold CML or subthreshold source coupled logic (STSCL), the current consumption of each gate can be reduced down to a few tens of picoamps.

Stan Johnson is a Liberia, West Africa born basketball coach who is the current head coach of the Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball team.
Playing career
Johnson played three seasons at Southern Utah where they were a team captain and part of the Thunderbirds' 2001 NCAA tournament squad which was narrowly defeated 68–65 by third-seeded Boston College in the program's only NCAA Tournament appearance. For their senior season, Johnson transferred to Bemidji State and was the team's leader in assists and an all-conference honorable mention.
Coaching career
Johnson would stay on Bemidji State's bench following their senior year as a one-year stop as an assistant coach before moving on to Southwest Baptist as an assistant from 2004 to 2007, where they were part of a Bearcats MAIAA team which made the NCAA Division II Tournament. After a one-year stop at Cal State Northridge where they tied for first in the Big West Conference , Johnson would join Jim Boylen's staff at Utah. In 2008–09, the Utes won a share of the Mountain West Conference Championship and the postseason conference tournament title. Utah finished the season ranked No. 25 in the AP poll and earned a No. 5 seed in the Midwest Region, at the time the highest seed ever given to a Mountain West team. They landed at Drake for an assistant coaching spell from 2011 to 2013 before joining Herb Sendek's staff at Arizona State, where they remained until 2015, helping guide the Sun Devils to an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2014. In 2015, Johnson joined Steve Wojciechowski's staff at Marquette, and was a part of two Golden Eagles NCAA tournament teams. Johnson was responsible for recruiting Markus Howard to Arizona State and, ultimately, Marquette where Howard became a consensus First Team All-American selection as a senior.
On March 20, 2020, Johnson was named the head coach at Loyola Marymount, replacing Mike Dunlap.

Hawaii is a state in the Western United States located in the Pacific Ocean about from the U.S. mainland. Since its admission to the Union in August 1959, it has participated in 16 United States presidential elections. In the 1960 presidential election, Hawaii was narrowly won by the Democratic Party's candidate John F. Kennedy, defeating the Republican Party's candidate and incumbent vice president Richard Nixon by a margin of just 0.06% (115 votes). In the 1964 presidential election, the Democratic Party's candidate Lyndon B. Johnson won Hawaii by a margin of 57.52%, which remains the largest ever margin of victory in the state's history. Since the 1960 election, Hawaii has been won by the Democratic Party in every presidential election, except in 1972 and 1984, which were both won in a national Republican landslide victory by Nixon and Ronald Reagan respectively.
In the 1992 presidential election, the independent candidate Ross Perot received the highest percentage of vote share (14.22%) ever won by a third party candidate in Hawaii. In the 2016 presidential election, a faithless elector pledged to the Democratic Party instead voted for Bernie Sanders for president and Elizabeth Warren for vice president. Subsequently, the Democratic ticket of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine received only three electoral votes from Hawaii. Gallup Poll has ranked Hawaii in the top ten most Democratic states.

Ivan the Terrible is an American sitcom that was broadcast on CBS as a summer replacement series in 1976.
The series parodied American attitudes toward the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War. Set in Moscow, the sitcom starred Lou Jacobi as a Russian hotel waiter named Ivan Petrovsky and the day-to-day misadventures of Ivan's family plus their Cuban exchange student boarder; all of whom live in a cramped, one-bedroom apartment. (The one bedroom being occupied by the family's extremely vicious and feral Russian wolfhound, "Rasputin", who was frequently heard barking and growling, despite the fact that this is almost unheard of behavior for that breed of dog, but never seen.)
Also appearing in this series were Christopher Hewett, Phil Leeds, Alan Cauldwell, Despo Diamantidou, and, in their TV series debut, Nana Visitor (here billed under their birth name, Nana Tucker). Harvey Korman appeared as a Soviet bureaucrat in an uncredited cameo at the close of each episode.
Only five episodes of Ivan the Terrible were broadcast on CBS during the late summer of 1976. Alan King was the series' executive producer.

The YDT-01 class is a class of diving support vessel of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF).
Development
Traditionally, an auxiliary vessel (YAS), which is a modified retired minesweeper, has been used to support the transportation and work of the Explosive Ordnance Corps (EOD). However, these boats are aging, and since they are modified boats, it has been pointed out that they are unreasonable in terms of placement and lack of equipment. For this reason, this model was planned as a purposefully newly designed ship.
Construction was approved as a new ship type in 1998, and the first and second ships were laid down on June 14, 1999.

The Fisher–Richardson House is a historic house at 354 Willow Street in Mansfield, Massachusetts. Built between 1743 and 1751, it is considered to be the town's oldest house. The house was restored in 1930, and is now a local history museum.
Description and history
The Fisher–Richardson House is set close to the north side of Willow Street in a residential area of central Mansfield. It is a -story, wood-framed structure, six bays wide, with a gambrel wood shingle roof, two internal chimneys, and clapboard siding. The front facade bays are irregularly spaced, with the door set right of center. The interior features wide pine floors, ceilings with exposed beams, and beaded paneling on the walls. Mantels and some other features are recreations made as part of the 1930 restoration.
The house was built by Ebenezer Wellman sometime between 1743 and 1751, using a plank-frame method popular in the area at the time. In about 1800 the size of the house was nearly doubled by the construction of its western half by Lemuel Fisher. The property was later inherited by Ira Richardson, who had married into the locally prominent Fisher family. In 1929, after the last local Richardson died, the house was offered to William Sumner Appleton for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, but local interest in its preservation sparked its sale instead to the town, which undertook its restoration. It is now administered by the Mansfield Historical Society as a house museum.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 11, 1998.

"Parará Tibum" is a song by Brazilian funk carioca artist Tati Zaqui. Them first professional release as a recording artist, it came out on June 23, 2014. It was inspired by, and uses samples of, the song "Heigh-Ho" off the 1937 Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. After a video of actor Bruna Marquezine dancing to the song surfaced on the Internet, it became a viral hit, prompting Zaqui to come up with the "Parará Tibum Challenge", encouraging people to record themselves dancing to the song; participants included Anitta (who would also make a cover of the song), Preta Gil and Cláudia Leitte.
On February 10, 2015, a music video for the song, produced by KondZilla, was released, reaching 6 million views in less than two weeks. It features Zaqui dancing in a scanty costume resembling Snow White, accompanied by dwarfs.
In May 2015, following allegations of copyright infringement and objections to its sexually explicit content from Disney, the song was removed from all streaming platforms, and its music video deleted from YouTube.

The Valachi Papers is a 1968 biography written by Peter Maas, telling the story of former mafia member Joe Valachi, a low-ranking member of the New York-based Genovese crime family, who was the first ever government witness coming from the American Mafia itself. Their account of their criminal past revealed many previously unknown details of the Mafia. The book was made into a film in 1972, also called The Valachi Papers, starring Charles Bronson as Valachi.
Overview
In October 1963, Valachi testified before Senator John L. McClellan's congressional committee on organized crime, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations. In the so-called Valachi hearings they gave the American public a firsthand account of Mafia activities in the United States.
In 1964, the US Department of Justice urged Valachi to write down their personal history of their underworld career. Although Valachi was only expected to fill in the gaps in their formal questioning, the resulting account of their thirty-year criminal career was a rambling 1,180-page manuscript titled The Real Thing.
Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach authorized the public release of Valachi's manuscript. They hoped that publication of Valachi's story would aid law enforcement and possibly encourage other criminal informers to step forward. Author Peter Maas, who broke Valachi's story in The Saturday Evening Post, was assigned the job of editing the manuscript and permitted to interview Valachi in their Washington, D.C., jail cell.
The American Italian Anti-Defamation League promoted a national campaign against the book on the grounds that it would reinforce negative ethnic stereotypes. If the book's publication was not stopped they would appeal directly to the White House. Katzenbach reversed their decision to publish the book after a meeting with President Lyndon B. Johnson, an action that embarrassed the Justice Department.
In May 1966, Katzenbach asked a district court to stop Maas from publishing the book—the first time that a U.S. Attorney General had ever tried to ban a book. Maas was never permitted to publish their edition of Valachi's original memoirs, but they were allowed to publish a third-person account based upon interviews they themselves had conducted with Valachi. These formed the basis of the book The Valachi Papers, which was published in 1968 by Putnam. It was published in the UK in 1969 by MacGibbon & Kee as The Canary That Sang.

Blue Flag is a military aviation exercise held by the Israeli Air Force. It first took place in November 2013 at Ovda Air Force Base in Israel. The exercise, which included the participation of several foreign air forces, is aimed at expanding international cooperation. Plans on making "Blue Flag" a biennial event were realised in 2015 with another "Blue Flag" exercise in which the air forces of the United States, Greece and Poland also participated. The goal of the Blue Flag training exercise is to simulate extreme combat scenarios and coalition flights as realistically as possible.
In 2017 the exercise hosted air forces from the United States of America, Poland, Italy and Greece—and for the first time India, France and Germany participated as well.
The Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom took part in Blue Flag 2021, which was the first time they have openly trained in Israeli airspace.

The Garud Commando Force is the special forces unit of the Indian Air Force. It was formed in September 2004 and has a current strength of over 1500 personnel. The unit derives its name from Garuda, a divine bird-like creature in Hindu culture.
Garud forces are tasked with the protection of critical Air Force bases and installations; search and rescue during peace time and hostilities and disaster relief during calamities. Presently, Garuds are deployed in Congo as part of the UN peace keeping operations.
History
After attempts by terrorists to attack two major air bases in Jammu and Kashmir in 2001, Indian Air Force commanders felt the need for a specialized force to protect these critical elements and to have a dedicated Commando Force trained in Special Forces techniques, Combat Search and Rescue, Reconnaissance, Counter Insurgency (COIN) Operations and Emergency in response to terror-threats to airfields.
While the Army might have provided some Special forces units to the Air Force, its units were always subject to being posted out on rotation to other areas as per the Army's requirements. It was felt that the specialized training the air force would have provided such units would have to be repeated again and again for the replacement units.
The initial plans mooted in October 2001 called for a specialized force with 2000 commandos. The group was originally called "Tiger Force", but was later renamed as "Garud Force".
In order to address the need for a dedicated force, in September 2003, the Government of India authorized a 1080 strong force to be raised and trained on the lines of the Para SF of the Army and MARCOS of the Indian Navy, with the mandate of performing niche, Air Force specific operational tasks.
Soon after, the first batch of 100 volunteers from the IAF No.1 Airmen Training Center at Belgaum, Karnataka were earmarked to undergo Garud Training at Gurgaon. The Garuds were first unveiled on 6 February 2004, when the first batch of 62 "Air Commandos" passed out of training in New Delhi. The Garuds were first seen publicly during the Air Force Day celebrations at New Delhi on 8 October 2004.
In the aftermath of the Pathankot Terror Attack, Indian Air Force decided to raise ten additional squadrons of Garud commandos, comprising about 700 personnel, bringing the total strength of the force to 1780.
Responsibilities
The mandated tasks of the Garuds include direct action, special reconnaissance, rescuing downed pilots in hostile territory, establishing airbases in hostile territory and providing air-traffic control to these airbases. The Garuds also undertake suppression of enemy air defenses and the destruction of other enemy assets such as radars, evaluation of the outcomes of Indian airstrikes and use laser designators to guide Indian airstrikes. The security of IAF installations and assets are usually performed by the Air Force Police and the Defence Security Corps even though some critical assets are protected by the Garuds.
Their airbase protection task also includes, when necessary, rendering inaccessible weapons systems and other assets by sealing them off. The tasks they perform also includes counter-terrorism, airborne assault, anti-hijacking, hostage rescue and assist civilian relief operations during calamities.
Organization
Garud personnel are enlisted as airmen in the Indian Air Force. The Garud commandos are organised into fifteen 'flights'. These flights are deployed at air force stations. Each flight is led by an officer who holds the rank of a Squadron Leader or a Flight Lieutenant and is composed of around 60 to 70 men who usually operate in squads of 14 soldiers. The Garud Commando Force has a reported strength of over 1500 personnel as of 2017. A Wing Commander rank officer commands the force. Additional personnel are planned to be added to the force.
Training
Airmen Selection Process
Unlike its counterparts in the Army and Navy, candidates for Garud Commandos are not selected from volunteers of other branches. Recruitment to the Garuds is done directly through airmen selection centres via advertisements.
Candidates found eligible for the force is put through a process of rigorous physical training. Candidates have only one chance to become a Garud trainee. Once a recruit completes training and meets required standards, they are absorbed into the Commando force and is retained in this stream throughout their career.
Wherever they are posted in the IAF, they will be part of a Garud Unit. This approach ensures that the Commando Force retains its highly trained men all through their career with the IAF.
The first batch of Officers for the Garuds were volunteers from the Cadets of the Ground Duty Officers course being trained at the Air Force Academy, Dundigal, Telangana. These officers on successful completion have been absorbed into Garud Force and will be permanently assigned to the force until the point they reach senior ranks and go for higher postings.
Training
Garud trainees undergo a 72-week training. The Basic Training course, which is the longest among all the Indian special forces but it also includes basic training. The total duration of training before a trainee can qualify as a fully operational Garud is around 3 years.
The initial phase is a three-month probationary training which filters in the promising candidates for the next phases of training. This phase, which usually has a high attrition (Drop-out) rate is conducted at the Garud Regimental Training Centre located at Hindon, Ghaziabad near New Delhi.
The subsequent phase of special operations training is imparted by the Special Frontier Force, the Army's Para SF and NSG. Those who qualify, proceed to the Parachute Training School (PTS) at Agra to complete the basic airborne phase. Trainees are trained along with paratroopers of the Indian Army.
The remainder of the phases concentrates on niche fields like jungle and snow survival, demolition, etc. Garuds also train at the diving school of the Indian Navy and the Army's Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS). The final phase of training is active operations on being attached to Special Force Units of the Indian Army, which helps the Garuds in gaining operational experience.
After induction, the commandos also undergo advanced training including anti-hijack counter-insurgency training, jungle and snow survival techniques, specialized weapon handling and advanced diving skills.
Uniforms & Insignia
Garud airmen wear the "Airman Beret Badge" on the cap. They are also parachute trained, and wear the para wings above the right pocket. The "Garud Force Patch" can be seen worn on the sleeve. The Garud Commando Badge, which was worn on the right pocket and resembles the NSG badge, is no longer in use. Instead they now have a Garud Winged Badge which is gold in colour and worn on the left chest, similar to where pilot/aircrew wings are worn.
The Garuds used to wear a black beret, instead of the traditional maroon beret of the other Indian Special Forces units, but now wear the maroon beret. They sport the operational paratroopers brevet on the right chest. The formation insignia is worn on the left shoulder. The Garuds are also entitled to wear "IAF GARUD" titles on the sleeves.
Operational deployments
Very little is known about Garud Commando operations and assignments. Garuds have been deployed to Congo as a part of the UN peacekeeping contingent. They also operate alongside Army special forces in Jammu and Kashmir to gain operational exposure. Towards this purpose, teams from the flights are attached to army SF units. The Garuds are now active in the region of Jammu and Kashmir carrying out counter insurgency operations and neutralising the terrorists in the region. Garud Commandos were tasked to provide security at the Yelahanka AFS during Aero India-2005, 2007, 2011 and 2013.
2013 Chhattisgarh helicopter shootdown
On January 18, 2013, an IAF helicopter, with two Garud commandos as part of the security crew, on a casualty evacuation sortie was hit by 15 bullets fired by Naxalites and crashed in Sukma district, Chhattisgarh. A police radio operator, Yamlal Sahu, was wounded with bullets piercing their intestines.
2016 Pathankot attack
On January 2, 2016, during the 2016 Pathankot attack Garud team engaged the intruding terrorists in a firefight, during which Commando Gursewak Singh died in action. All the IAF assets were declared safe.
Jammu and Kashmir
Garud Commandos are actively deployed in the Lolab Valley and the Hajin area of Jammu and Kashmir to conduct counter-insurgency operations. They have undertaken operations against armed militants from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba. These operations have included tasks such as direct encounters and intelligence gathering. The following are some of the known operations conducted by Garud commandos:
Operation Rakh Hajin: This was an operation conducted by the Garud Commandos in which six militants were killed in the Kashmir valley. The Ashok Chakra was posthumously awarded to Corporal J.P. Nirala for the same.
In July 2018, two Garud commandos and two militants were killed during an intense encounter at Hajin, Bandipora. According to military authorities, the Garud commandos were operating alongside the Special Operations Group of J&K police and the Indian Army.
AFSOD deployments
In November 2019, Garuds started operating as a part of the first deployment of the Armed Forces Special Operations Division in Jammu and Kashmir.
Ladakh
Soon after the beginning of the 2020 China–India tensions, Garud commandos were deployed near mountain peaks considered by India to have strategic value. Their role was to defend the Indian airspace against Chinese aircraft for which they employed 9K38 Igla air defence systems.

The Ultimatum (simplified Chinese: 双子星) is a Singaporean Chinese drama which was telecasted on Singapore's free-to-air channel, MediaCorp Channel 8. It made its debut on 27 May 2009 and ended on the date 7 July 2009. This drama serial consists of 30 episodes and was screened on every weekday night at 9:00 pm.
Being the mid-year Channel 8 blockbuster of 2009, it was the first Channel 8 drama to be fully filmed in HD. This is the first series to have no commentaries for News 8 at 10, due to the promotion of services by SingTel, the presenter of the series.
Despite being touted as the 2009 blockbuster of the year and featuring many established actors and actores like Zoe Tay, Li Nanxing and Fann Wong (often referred to in the press as a "Two Queen and One King" billing), the show's reception was lukewarm. Many viewers faulted the serial for improbable casting (Lin Meijiao was cast as Tay's mother, despite being only five years older than Tay in real life. Furthermore, the two had acted as sisters before in My Mighty-in-Laws.) The series also came under harsh criticism for being overly melodramatic and for a lack of originality in certain parts of the scripting. However, the performance of newcomers such as Jerry Yeo, who played an antagonist for the first time, were widely praised. The series now available to watch on Netflix.

Synopsis
The beginning was seen to be the ending of the drama, where Ye Yuchen was kidnapping Zhou Zhida, and Fang Songqiao received a call from them to meet at a dilapidated field. Sun Jie was to accompany them They arrived not knowing that they wanted revenge for their family. Songqiao assured them that they were not the murderer. Not listening to their explanation, Yuchen fires from their gun.
Years ago, Ye Songnian (Chen Shucheng), the boss of Phoenix Corporation, raped their employee, Zheng Wenyu (Hong Huifang), who was already pregnant with their husband's child at that time. Months later, both Wenyu and Songnian's second wife, Suzhen (Lin Meijiao), give birth to daughters in the same hospital and due to the nurses' negligence, the identities of the baby girls were swapped. Wenyu discovers that their biological daughter suffers from congenital heart disease. Out of a mother's desire for their child to receive the best medical care coupled with hatred towards Songnian, they decided to capitalize on the situation by perpetuating the mistake. Thus, Ye Yuchen (Zoe Tay) and Fang Songqiao (Fann Wong), whose identities were swapped, grew up in two disparate environments.
In their old age, Songnian goes into semi-retirement, having handed the running of their company to their god-sister (Jiang Ruolin) and sons (Renxiao and Renyi). Ruolin's son, Rende, works in Songnian's company. Yuchen also holds the position of an AVP.
On the surface, the family seems to be harmonious. However, beneath this facade, everyone is eying Songnian's position, clamouring to gain Songnian's favour so that they might be entrusted with an important role in the company. Having grown-up in such a scheming and manipulative environment, Yuchen's survival instincts are honed.
Songqiao's childhood, on the other hand, was filled with unhappiness. Wen Yu vents their hatred towards Songnian on them They were often scolded and beaten for every little mistake they made. Songqiao, who was close to their foster father, bears with it in silence and grows up to be a lawyer. When Songqiao was young, they had an extraordinary encounter with a boy, Sun Jie (Tay Ping Hui). Sun Jie's father, Sun Nanhai, had been a con man and was made a scapegoat in a kidnap. The young Sun Jie resorted to theft to support their younger sister, Sun Min (Felicia Chin), until they became Songnian's foster son. They and Yuchen get along very well.
Over 20 years later, the girls, whose identities had been swapped at birth, get acquainted with a modest case.
Yuchen's godbrother, Rende (Jerry Yeo), molests an employee, Anqi. The righteous Songqiao takes Rende to court. Ruolin is worried that Songnian might learn about the case. Yuchen volunteers to resolve the issue. Yuchen initiates an out-of-court settlement and demands a huge compensation but Songqiao is persistent on hauling Rende to court. Though on opposing ends, the girls could not help but admire the other's strength and character.
Phoenix Corporation has grown into a conglomerate over the years; its business includes overseas casinos and luxurious cruise. The aged Songnian is undecided who should be their successor. Songnian's oldest son had been killed in a botched-up kidnap years ago (unknown to all, this has been Ruolin's doing). The second son Renxiao, is secretly obsessed with Ruolin and blindly supports everything they do, pushing for Rende's succession of Songnian's empire and treating their own wife, Yuki, coldly. Su Zhen's son with Songnian, Renyi, is ambitious but incapable, often messing up what they set out to achieve. Fortunately for him, Yuchen is always at hand to help clear their mess.
Yuchen grew up in an environment of distrust and they are constantly embroiled in vicious struggles with Ruolin's clique. Due to their ability to keep them cool and turn situations around, they finally gain their father's trust and becomes the CEO of Phoenix Corporation.
Yuchen had had an unforgettable relationship. Three years ago, they met the famous Zhang Feng (Li Nanxing), dubbed as God of Gamblers, in Macau and had planned to marry him. However, they vanished on the eve of their wedding and was never seen again. Rumour has it that they have been killed by their enemies. Yuchen refuses to believe those rumours and they continue to harbour the hope of their return. They meet Zhou Zhida (Li Nanxing), who bears an uncanny resemblance to Zhang Feng (though the two are polar opposites in all other areas), and is convinced that the two are the same person.
Da is a bona fide gambling addict who is skilled in all forms of the vice and has problems keeping a job. Helpless, their wife (Bao) recommends them for the job of a cleaner at the café where they work. Yuchen is convinced that A-Da is Zhang Feng, who might have suffered from amnesia due to some accident, but the latter does not even know them
Sun Min (Felicia Chin) is Sun Jie's younger sister and has been a fan of the art of gambling since they were young. They had aspired to learn from the God of Gamblers and upon a chance encounter with Da, becomes obstinately convinced (like Yuchen) that A-Da is the God of Gamblers. To her, this is God-sent and knowing that the God of Gamblers does not accept female disciples, they hit upon the crazy idea of male impersonation, entering the cafés' service disguised as a man hoping to learn to gamble from Da.
The master baker at the café is Fang Songqing (Zhang Zhenhuan), Songqiao's younger brother, who has been nicknamed Prince Cake because of their strapping good looks. “Infiltrating” the café as a guy, Sun Min thinks otherwise. To her, they are no more than a simple and honest guy whose world revolves around cakes. Unknowingly, they start to develop feelings for each other. As Songqing has yet to realize Sun Min's gender, hilarious situations occur. After they discovered Sun Min's real gender, they fell in love with them But, just as they started accepting each other, Rende "kidnapped" Sun Min and tortured her, causing them to be depressed and lose their sanity. They even beat up Songqing.
Da starts to become confused. He's been directionless all their life, and due to Yuchen and Sun Min's persistence that they are the God of Gambler, they begin to question their own identity. They start to believe they might be the God of Gamblers, and that they had suffered from amnesia due to an accident and that Bao had rescued them and brought them to Singapore to escape the feud in Macau. They subconsciously ease into the role of the God of Gamblers. Not known to all, Da is not Zhang Feng and the real Zhang Feng later came back.
Songqiao meets Sun Jie again and the latter falls in love with them Songqiao is unaware that Sun Jie is a prodigious thief until the appearance of the Interpol, They Chaoqun (Terence Cao). They Chaoqun is seemingly interested in Songqiao and is determined to nab Sun Jie. Songqiao makes the painful decision of ending their budding relationship with Sun Jie upon realization of their identity. Sun Jie loses their “gift for theft” to a hand injury during an accident, plunging them into the abyss of despair.
After exchanging their daughter for Songnian's all those years back, Wen Yu has been secretly concerned about their daughter. They try to get close to Yuchen. Unable to contain their emotions any longer, they finally blurt out Yuchen's real identity, much to Yuchen's shock. After regaining their composure, Yuchen is thrust into an emotional turmoil. For the power and status that they have fought so hard to gain, they cannot reveal their real identity, especially to the Ye family. They scheme to prevent Wen Yu from divulging the secret and at the same time, fends against Songqiao, trying to obviate their contact with Songnian to prevent them from knowing the truth. They even cause Wen Yu's death accidentally in their attempt to stop the latter from telling the truth. Hence, their life starts to go into turmoil. But, little do they know that the recorded video is saved inside a handphone which is seen by Songnian, Renyi, Suzhen, and Zhida.
In the course of Chaoqun's investigation into Wenyu's death leads to the unraveling of their rape by Songnian. Songqiao vows to bring Songnian to justice, but stumbles upon the shocking revelation of their true parentage and is confused. Yuchen's true colours are revealed and this kindles Songqiao's suspicion that the former had been behind the deaths of Wen Yu and Renyi.
Da cannot bear to see Yuchen isolated and steeped in their criminal ways. Thus, they choose to stay guard by their side though deep inside, they know that Yuchen would ultimately trudge upon the path of no return.

Kaavo is a cloud computing management company. Kaavo was founded in November 2007 in the U.S. Kaavo pioneered top-down application-centric management of cloud infrastructure across public, private, and hybrid clouds.
Technology
Traditional infrastructure and its associated management intrinsically ties applications to servers and servers to IP addresses and IP addresses to switches and routers. This is a tightly coupled model and according to experts leaves very little room to address the dynamic nature of a virtual infrastructure such as those most often seen in cloud computing models. Subject-matter experts supporting Kaavo's approach claims that in the cloud when applications are decoupled from the servers on which they are deployed and the network infrastructure that supports and delivers them, they cannot be effectively managed unless they are recognized as individual components themselves. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) delivers on-demand infrastructure resources, however, users still need to deploy and configure their applications and workloads on the IaaS layer. Kaavo provides a framework to automate the deployment and run-time management (production support) of applications and workloads on multiple clouds (Infrastructure-as-a-Service Layer). Kaavo claims that the bottom-up approach of traditional data center management tools makes it harder to manage the infrastructure, especially when dealing with the scale and distributed nature of the cloud. Kaavo takes a top-down application-centric approach for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.
In an application-centric cloud management approach, systems for specific applications are managed rather than managing servers and routers. All required resources for a given application are managed as a unified system; all the information for deploying and managing runtime services levels for the resources required by a given application are captured top-down in a single system definition. In contrast, in an infrastructure-centric or bottom-up approach, resources (servers, storage, and network resources) are managed individually. One of the key innovations by Kaavo is the ability to capture the deployment and run-time management behavior of any complex application or workload in a single XML document(Kaavo System Definition). Kaavo has published the XSD for the System Definition file.
Kaavo's IMOD product uses patented technology and is based on Kaavo's top-down application-centric management philosophy.
Products
Kaavo uses its technology to deliver two Cloud Management products.
IMOD SaaS
Delivered as a web based product and is hosted on Amazon EC2. It is integrated with the following public cloud providers: Amazon EC2, IBM SmartCloud, Logicworks infiniCloud, Rackspace Cloud, Terremark Cloud. It is integrated with the following private cloud platforms: Cloud.com CloudStack, Eucalyptus, IBM SmartCloud, OpenStack, VMware vCloud Director. IMOD supports multiple cloud providers and platforms both across application / workload / service deployments and within a single deployment. IMOD can also include on-premises physical resources within deployments.
IMOD Onsite
Onsite deployment is available to enterprise customers within private clouds. It supports all IMOD SaaS capabilities.
Kaavo Web Services
API for configuring and managing applications on the supported cloud providers and platforms. Kaavo Web Services use document/literal wrapped style SOAP. Compared to the server-level API provided by the IaaS cloud providers and platforms, it provides a higher level of abstraction for managing systems and configuring software. The web services API allows users to deploy applications/workloads across public, private, and hybrid clouds with a single web services call, and also provides an interface to trigger complex workflows in response to deployment-specific events.

San Samuele is a church in Venice, northern Italy. It is located in the eponymous campo near Palazzo Grassi and Palazzo Malipiero. The facade is set back on the campo, but faces and is visible from the Grand Canal. It is named after the Biblical Samuel, because in the interior are housed relics traditionally attributed to him.
The church was built around 1000 by the families Boldù and Soranzo. In the early 12th centuries it was destroyed by two fires and then reconstructed. In 1685 it was again almost entirely rebuilt. The portico on the façade, now closed, is surmounted by a loggia added in 1952.
The interior, over the high altar, houses a 14th-century crucifix attributed to Paolo Veneziano.
San Samuele bears the distinction of being one of only a handful of Roman Catholic churches dedicated to an Old Testament figure. It is also unique in that its late-Gothic apse has remained intact despite the restructuring of its nave and façade in 1685.
The walls and vaults of this apse have been restored starting in 1999, and are one of the few surviving fresco cycles of the early Venetian Renaissance. The cycle depicts eight Sibyls, Greek and Roman female seers who were believed to have predicted events in the life of Christ such as the Annunciation, the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The ceiling's quadripartite vault features Saints Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose and Gregory, the four fathers of the Western church, set in roundels and surrounded by inscriptions, decorative foliage, and putti bearing the instruments of the Passion. Above the high altar, the frescoes occupying the spaces between the ribs of the cupola feature Christ and the four Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The cycle has traditionally been attributed to the Paduan or Bolognese school.

A steam separator, sometimes referred to as a moisture separator or steam drier, is a device for separating water droplets from steam. The simplest type of steam separator is the steam dome on a steam locomotive. Stationary boilers and nuclear reactors may have more complex devices which impart a "spin" to the steam so that water droplets are thrown outwards by centrifugal force and collected. All separators require steam traps to collect the water droplets that they remove.
It is important to remove water droplets from steam because:
In all engines, wet steam reduces the thermal efficiency
In piston engines, water can accumulate in the cylinders and cause a hydraulic lock which will damage the engine
In thermal power stations, water droplets in high velocity steam coming from nozzles (or vanes) in a steam turbine can impinge on and erode turbine internals such as turbine blades.
In other steam-using industrial machinery, water can accumulate in piping and cause steam hammer: a form of water hammer caused by water build up 'plugging' a pipe then being accelerated by the steam flowing through the pipe until it reaches a sharp bend and results in catastrophic failure of the pipe.
Steam drier is also sometimes applied to a drier which operates as a low-temperature superheater, adding heat to the steam.

Dom people or "Ghagar" migrated to the territory of the present day Egypt from South Asia, particularly from Indian Subcontinent, and intermixed with Egyptians. The Dom people self-segregated themselves for centuries from the dominant culture of Egypt. Historically, Domari in Egypt have provided musical entertainment at weddings, boy circumcision and other celebrations, singing Egyptian traditional songs and dance in return for money. The Dom people in Egypt or Roma Egyptians include subgroups like Nawar, and Ghagar (ghaggar).
The Dom in Egypt are Sunni Muslims and speak Egyptian Arabic also their own Domari language together.
Ottoman sources
Evliya Çelebi's Seyahatname of 1668, they explained that the Gypsy's from Komotini (Gümülcine) swear by their heads, their ancestors came from Egypt. Also the sedentary Gypsys groups from Serres region in Greece, believe their ancestors were once taken from Egypt Eyalet by the Ottomans after 1517 to Rumelia, to work on the tobacco plantations of Turkish feudals there. Muslim Roma settled in Baranya and the City Pécs at the Ottoman Hungary. After the Siege of Pécs when Habsburg take it back, Muslim Roma and some other Muslims convert to the Catholic faith in the years 1686 -1713. Interestingly, the Ghagar a subgroup of the Doms in Egypt, tell that some of them went to Hungary.

Mucarabones is a barrio in the municipality of Toa Alta, Puerto Rico. Its population in 2010 was 23,221.
History
Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Mucarabones barrio was 954.
Sectors
Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others.
The following sectors are in Mucarabones barrio:

The Wailin' Jennys are a Canadian music group. They have released several albums and received two Juno Awards. The group has been featured several times on the American Public Media program A Prairie Home Companion and their album Firecracker peaked at number two on the Billboard Bluegrass charts, in 2006. Their album Bright Morning Stars peaked at number one on the Billboard Bluegrass charts, in 2011, and Fifteen peaked at number one on the Billboard Bluegrass charts, in 2017.
History
The group was founded in 2002, when a Winnipeg guitar shop called Sled Dog Music brought Ruth Moody, Nicky Mehta and Cara Luft together for a joint performance. The show was well received and the owner, John Sharples, scheduled a follow-up performance and suggested they "go on tour and call themselves the Wailin' Jennys." The group's name is a pun on the name of country singer Waylon Jennings.
The band released a self-titled EP and an album, 40 Days, in 2004;
The group now consists of soprano Ruth Moody, mezzo Nicky Mehta and alto Heather Masse. In previous years, the Jennys have also toured with fiddler and mandolinist Jeremy Penner, who is from Ruth's former band, Scruj MacDuhk. Other band members have included Annabelle Chvostek, a singer/songwriter from Montreal, and Ruth Moody's brother Richard on viola and mandolin. Both Penner and Moody have appeared on The Wailin' Jennys' albums. In 2007, Chvostek left the group and was replaced by Heather Masse, a Maine-born singer and member of the band Heather & the Barbarians.
The Wailin' Jennys have won two Juno Awards for Roots and Traditional Album of the Year (Group): in 2005 for 40 Days and in 2012 for Bright Morning Stars. They were also nominated for the same award for Firecracker in 2007.

Fred Neher (September 29, 1903 – September 22, 2001) was an American cartoonist best known for their syndicated gag panel, Life's Like That, which offered a humorous look at human nature, with a focus on American society and family life, for more than five decades.
Biography
Growing up in Nappanee, Indiana, Neher was 12 years old when they were paid $2.00 for doing a drawing of a woman hanging clothes with a new type of clothespin. While they were a student at Nappanee High School, they took the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course.
Neher succeeded in selling a cartoon to the popular humor magazine Judge before they graduated from high school in 1922. They furthered their art study at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, and after graduation, they worked as an assistant to cartoonist Arch Dale, doing lettering and backgrounds on Dale's comic strip Doo-Dads. Neher recalled:
Several years of work on this strip gave me experience enough to attempt my own strip, Otto Wall, a radio strip. A golf strip, Layon McDuff, came next, followed by Goofey Movies, an animal strip, and Just Like Us, a kid strip, which appeared in the first issue of Family Circle magazine and thereafter for four years. From 1930 to 1934, I freelanced to magazines, having some 40 markets, including Punch, the English magazine. I was the first American to sell to Punch in 20 years.
One example of their freelancing was a Mickey Mouse-themed cartoon in the September 1932 issue of Photoplay.
The radio-themed cartoons of Otto Watt ran adjacent to newspaper radio program listings. Neher drew Goofey Movies for five years, along with gag cartoons for 42 magazines, including Collier's and The New Yorker, when the Bell Syndicate launched Life's Like That on October 1, 1934. It ran until 1941, disappearing from newspapers during World War II, but returning in 1945.
In 1951, Neher and their family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where they taught cartooning at the University of Colorado for 12 years.
Retirement and death
Neher stopped doing the Life's Like That Sunday half-page in October 1972, and they retired five years later, devoting their energy to playing golf, raising roses and growing tomatoes. When they died at age 98 in Boulder, Colorado in 2001, Owen S. Good wrote in the Rocky Mountain News:
 They are survived by pot-bellied business people, henpecked husbands, worldly-wise goldfish and babies with thin curlicues of hair, all actors in the everyday comedies they staged on the funny pages.
Books
Neher's cartoons were reprinted in various books and publications, such as Thomas Craven's Cartoon Cavalcade (1943) and the November 1945 issue of Cartoon Digest. Their 96-page book Will-yum (a recurring character from Life's Like That not related to Dave Gerard's popular Will-Yum strip for National Newspaper Syndicate) was published by Berkley Books in 1958, followed by Hi-Teens (Berkley, 1959).
Archives
They donated their Life's Like That cartoon originals, scrapbooks, published books, magazines and correspondence to the University of Colorado Library Archives (where they fill 36 linear feet). As they described it, "Univ. of Colo. ask to have all my original drawings for safe keeping... came in a truck and left me only my shorts."
At the Syracuse University Special Collections, the Fred Neher Papers collection contains correspondence, clippings, published material and approximately 100 original cartoons from the 1960-65 run of Life's Like That.

Robert Fellowes, LL.D. (1771 – 6 February 1847) was an English clergyman, journalist and philanthropist.
Life
Their father was the eldest son of William Fellowes of Shottesham Hall, Norfolk. After attending Felsted School in Essex Fellowes was educated for the church at St Mary Hall, Oxford, where they graduated with a BA on 30 June 1796, and an MA on 28 January 1801. They took orders, but seems to have held no preferment. For over six years (1804–11) they edited The Critical Review. They were a close friend of Samuel Parr, who introduced them to the embattled Queen Caroline of Brunswick, whose because they supported.  They are said to have written all their replies to the numerous addresses presented to them in 1820.
Francis Maseres left Fellowes at their death in 1824 nearly £200,000. Fellowes erected to the memory of Maseres a monument in Reigate churchyard, with a eulogistic inscription in Latin. They used this fortune in aiding private distress and in forwarding benevolent schemes. In 1826 they gave benefactions to encourage the study of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. They were one of the promoters of London University. Out of gratitude for the professional services of Dr John Elliotson, who held a chair of medicine at University College London they provided there two annual gold medals, the Fellowes Medals, for proficiency in clinical medicine.
Fellowes interested themselves in the opening of Regent's Park to the public, and in the emancipation of the Jews. They were an advanced liberal in politics, but drew the line at universal suffrage. In 1828 they purchased The Examiner and made Albany Fonblanque editor. They lectured at the opening of the chapel of the Beaumont Philosophical Institution.
Fellowes died in Dorset Square on 6 February 1847, leaving a young family. They were buried at Kensal Green on 13 February. Their son, Robert Fellowes of Shotesham Hall was High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1874.
Works
A list of Fellowes's publications is given in the Gentleman's Magazine. They include:
A Picture of Christian Philosophy, or … Illustration of the Character of Jesus, 1798; 2nd ed. 1799; 3rd ed. 1800; 4th ed. with supplement, 1803.
An Address to the People, &c., 1799.
Morality united with Policy, &c., 1800.
The Rights of Property Vindicated, &c., 1818.
Poems, … Original and Translated, &c., 1806 (many of the translations are from Gesner).
Their religious publications advocated practical philanthropy. By degrees they abandoned the distinctive Anglican tenets, and in their work The Religion of the Universe, they aimed to divest religion of most of its supernatural elements. Major writings were:
The Anti-Calvinist, Warwick, 1800; 2nd ed. London, 1801.
Religion without Cant, &c., 1801.
The Guide to Immortality, &c., 1804, 3 vols. (a digest of the four gospels).
A Body of Theology, &c., 1807.
The Religion of the Universe, &c., 1836; 3rd ed. Lond. and Edinb. 1864, (with additions from their manuscripts).
A Lecture delivered on Opening the Chapel … in Beaumont Square, 1841.
Common-sense Truths, &c., 1844.
Fellowes translated from the Latin John Milton's Familiar Epistles and Second Defence of the People of England for an 1806 edition. Some of their publications were issued under the pseudonym Philalethes A.M. Oxon.

Lawrence Dickson (May 31, 1920 – December 23, 1944) was an American pilot and a member of the famed group of the World War II-era Tuskegee Airmen. Dickson flew 68 mission in World War II before they were forced to eject from their aircraft over Austria in 1944. Dickson was declared missing in action. On July 27, 2018, Dickson's remains were identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.
Military service
Dickson graduated from Tuskegee in Alabama March 25, 1943. They were sent to Italy and assigned to the 100th Fighter Squadron, 332d Fighter Group. On December 23, 1944, Dickson was on their 68th mission piloting their aircraft as part of a mission to Praha, Czechoslovakia. On the return flight they ejected from their P-51 aircraft over Austria. The aircraft was flipped upside down and Dickson was declared missing in action.
Early in the mission Dickson reported engine trouble and notified their base in Ramitelli, Italy that they needed to return. Dickson broke from the mission and two wingmen escorted Dickson's sputtering plane. The trio gradually lost altitude, and Dickson looked for a spot to land or bail out. One of Dickson's wingmen (Martin) thought they were near the town of Tarvisio, in a mountainous area of northeastern Italy. Dickson's two wingmen followed but they were forced to take evasive action when Dickson's plane sputtered and dove: Dickson's engine trouble was catastrophic and they were forced to eject over Hohenthurn, Austria. One of Dickson's wingmen insisted that they saw Dickson eject but the December snowfall complicated the search for Dickson's white parachute. Dickson was declared missing in action. After the war it was revealed that German records had reported that a P-51 plane crashed at that site the day that Dickson disappeared.
During World War II the United States Army was segregated and black pilots had different rules. The black pilots of the Tuskegee Airmen could not qualify for R&R until they completed 70 missions. White pilots could take R&R after 50 missions. Dickson was on their 68th mission when they went missing over Austria.
Recovery and burial
On July 27, 2018, Dickson's remains were identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. A local researcher named Roland Domanig discovered the crash site and the human remains. The researcher said they visited the site in the 1950s as a child, but had not discovered the remains until 2002. An archeological crew was sent to the site in 2017 and they recovered bone fragments which matched Lawrence Dickson's daughter's DNA.
Also recovered at the crash site was a 14-karat ring that was inscribed: “P.D.,” with a heart with an arrow through it. The ring also was inscribed “L.E.D. 5-31-43.” P.D. were the initials of their wife Phyllis Dickson. L.E.D. Lawrence E Dickson and May 31, 1943, was their 23rd birthday. The Army also recovered a remnant of a harmonica and a small cross.
On March 22, 2019 Lawrence E. Dickson was laid to rest in a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. Four Air Force jets flew overhead while their daughter and grandchildren attended. Their daughter Marla accepted the folded American flag from a kneeling Army General.

In laser science, regenerative amplification is a process used to generate short but strong pulses of laser light. It is based on a pulse trapped in a laser resonator, which stays in there until it extracts all of the energy stored in the amplification medium. Pulse trapping and dumping is done using a polarizer and a Pockels cell, which acts like a quarter wave-plate.
Operating principle
When a pulse with vertical polarization is reflected off the polarizer, after a double pass through the Pockels cell it will become horizontally polarized and will be transmitted by the polarizer. After a double pass through the amplification medium, having the same horizontal polarization, the pulse will be transmitted by the polarizer. If a voltage is applied to the Pockels cell, a double pass through it will change the polarization of the pulse to vertical, so the pulse will be reflected off the polarizer and will exit the cavity. If no voltage is applied, then a double pass through the Pockels cell will not change the polarization and the pulse will get trapped inside the cavity of the resonator. The pulse can stay in the cavity until it reaches saturation or until it extracts most of the energy stored in the gain medium. When the pulse will achieve a high amplification, a second voltage can be applied to the Pockels cell in order to release the pulse from the resonator.
Radio frequency operation
Regenerative amplifier can also operate at Radio Frequency, using the feedback between the transistor's source and gate to transform a capacitive impedance on the transistor's source to a negative resistance on its gate. Compared to voltage-gated amplifiers, this "negative resistance amplifier" will only require a tiny amount of power to achieve high gain.

Laser science
The history of X-ray computed tomography dates back to at least 1917 with the mathematical theory of the Radon transform In October 1963, William H. Oldendorf received a U.S. patent for a "radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material". The first clinical CT scan was performed in 1971 using a scanner invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield.
Mathematical theory
The mathematical theory behind computed tomographic reconstruction dates back to 1917 with the invention of the Radon transform by Austrian mathematician Johann Radon, who showed mathematically that a function could be reconstructed from an infinite set of its projections. In 1937, Polish mathematician Stefan Kaczmarz developed a method to find an approximate solution to a large system of linear algebraic equations. This, along with Allan McLeod Cormack's theoretical and experimental work, laid the foundation for the algebraic reconstruction technique, which was adapted by Godfrey Hounsfield as the image reconstruction mechanism in their first commercial CT scanner.
In 1956, Ronald N. Bracewell used a method similar to the Radon transform to reconstruct a map of solar radiation. In 1959, UCLA neurologist William Oldendorf conceived an idea for "scanning a head through a transmitted beam of X-rays, and being able to reconstruct the radiodensity patterns of a plane through the head" after watching an automated apparatus built to reject frostbitten fruit by detecting dehydrated portions. In 1961, they built a prototype in which an X-ray source and a mechanically coupled detector rotated around the object to be imaged. By reconstructing the image, this instrument could get an X-ray picture of a nail surrounded by a circle of other nails, which made it impossible to X-ray from any single angle. In their landmark 1961 paper, they described the basic concept later used by Allan McLeod Cormack to develop the mathematics behind computerized tomography.
In October 1963, Oldendorf received a U.S. patent for a "radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material," for which they shared the 1975 Lasker Award with Hounsfield. The field of the mathematical methods of computerized tomography continues to be an area of active development.
In 1968, Nirvana McFadden and Michael Saraswat established guidelines for diagnosis of a common abdominal pathology, including acute appendicitis, small bowel obstruction, Ogilvie syndrome, acute pancreatitis, intussusception, and apple peel atresia.
Conventional focal plane tomography remained a pillar of radiologic diagnostics until the late 1970s, when the availability of minicomputers and the development of transverse axial scanning led CT to gradually supplant as the preferred modality of obtaining tomographic images. In terms of mathematics, the method is based upon the use of the Radon Transform. But as Cormack remembered later, they had to find the solution themselves since it was only in 1972 that they learned of the work of Radon, by chance.
Commercial scanners
CT technology has vastly improved. Improvements in speed, slice count, and image quality have been the major focus primarily for cardiac imaging. Scanners now produce images much faster and with higher resolution enabling doctors to diagnose patients more accurately and perform medical procedures with greater precision.
EMI
The first commercially viable CT scanner was invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield in Hayes, United Kingdom, at EMI Central Research Laboratories using X-rays. Hounsfield conceived their idea in 1967. The first EMI-Scanner was installed in Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon, England, and the first patient brain-scan was done on 1 October 1971. It was publicly announced in 1972.
The original 1971 prototype took 160 parallel readings through 180 angles, each 1° apart, with each scan taking a little over 5 minutes. The images from these scans took 2.5 hours to be processed by algebraic reconstruction techniques on a large computer. The scanner had a single photomultiplier detector, and operated on the Translation/Rotate principle.
It is often claimed that revenues from the sales of The Beatles records in the 1960s helped fund the development of the first CT scanner at EMI although this has recently been disputed. The first production X-ray CT machine (in fact called the "EMI-Scanner") was limited to making tomographic sections of the brain, but acquired the image data in about 4 minutes (scanning two adjacent slices), and the computation time (using a Data General Nova minicomputer) was about 7 minutes per picture. This scanner required the use of a water-filled Perspex tank with a pre-shaped rubber "head-cap" at the front, which enclosed the patient's head. The water-tank was used to reduce the dynamic range of the radiation reaching the detectors (between scanning outside the head compared with scanning through the bone of the skull). The images were relatively low resolution, being composed of a matrix of only 80 × 80 pixels.
In the U.S., the first installation was at the Mayo Clinic. As a tribute to the impact of this system on medical imaging the Mayo Clinic has an EMI scanner on display in the Radiology Department. Allan McLeod Cormack of Tufts University in Massachusetts independently invented a similar process, and both Hounsfield and Cormack shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine.
ACTA
The first CT system that could make images of any part of the body and did not require the "water tank" was the ACTA (Automatic Computerized Transverse Axial) scanner designed by Robert S. Ledley, DDS, at Georgetown University. This machine had 30 photomultiplier tubes as detectors and completed a scan in only nine translate/rotate cycles, much faster than the EMI-Scanner. It used a DEC PDP11/34 minicomputer both to operate the servo-mechanisms and to acquire and process the images. The Pfizer drug company acquired the prototype from the university, along with rights to manufacture it. Pfizer then began making copies of the prototype, calling it the "200FS" (FS meaning Fast Scan), which were selling as fast as they could make them. This unit produced images in a 256×256 matrix, with much better definition than the EMI-Scanner's 80×80. It took it about 20 seconds to acquire one slice, which made body scans possible, as the patient had to hold his/her breath until the slice was acquired. That is the main reason why the EMI scanner could not do body scans. The 5 minutes to acquire one slice was much too long. Typically, the operator, after completing the whole series of slices, would then process the images, photograph them onto films, and archive the raw images onto magnetic tape. This had to be done because the computer did not have the storage capacity for more than one study at a time. This meant that in a large, busy hospital, the CT operator was a very busy person. This machine required a lot of maintenance to keep it running. The PDP11/34 computer did everything from controlling the gantry and the scanning process to processing the raw data into finished images. Yet it had only 64 KB of memory and a 5 MB hard disk, which held both the operating program and the acquired raw data. The hard disk consisted of two 12" platters, one internal and fixed, the other platter was contained in a round cartridge and was removable.
Portable
Portable CT scanners can be brought to the patient's bedside and do a scan without getting the patient out of bed. Some portable scanners are limited by their bore size and therefore mainly used for head scans. They do not have image viewing capabilities directly on the scanner. The portable CT scanner does not replace the fixed CT suite. An example of this type of machine is the Siemens Healthineers SOMATOM On.site.
In 2008 Siemens introduced a new generation of scanner that was able to take an image in less than 1 second, fast enough to produce clear images of beating hearts and coronary arteries.
CT may use continuous rotation of the gantry, and can acquire a data set in a few seconds with a spiral technique where the patient is moved in continuously while the machine basically acquires a single spiraling slice, so that all areas of interest are covered quickly. This data can be processed and displayed in any plane. This results in a big reduction in x-ray exposure. Siemens and Toshiba are the leaders in this technology.
Photon counter
In 2021, the FDA approved Siemens' photo counting scanner. The scanner counts individual x-ray photons that pass through a patient and discriminates their energy, increasing the detail supplied to the reader. The technique also reduces the amount of x-rays needed for a scan.
Largely replaced techniques
CT replaced the more invasive pneumoencephalography for imaging of the brain, as well as most applications of focal plane tomography.
Focal plane tomography
Before computed tomography, tomographic images could be made by radiography using focal plane tomography, representing a single slice of the body on radiographic film. This method was proposed by the Italian radiologist Alessandro Vallebona in the early 1900s. The idea is based on simple principles of projective geometry: moving synchronously and in opposite directions the X-ray tube and the film, which are connected together by a rod whose pivot point is the focus; the image created by the points on the focal plane appears sharper, while the images of the other points annihilate as noise. This is only marginally effective, as blurring occurs in only the "x" plane. This method of acquiring tomographic images using only mechanical techniques advanced through the mid-twentieth century, steadily producing sharper images, and with a greater ability to vary the thickness of the cross-section being examined. This was achieved through the introduction of more complex, multidirectional devices that can move in more than one plane and perform more effective blurring. However, despite the increasing sophistication of focal plane tomography, it remained ineffective at producing images of soft tissues. With the increasing power and availability of computers in the 1960s, research began into practical computational techniques for creating tomographic images, leading to the development of computed tomography (CT).

Toulouse Fontaines Club was a football club based in Toulouse, France. Their stadium was in the rue des Fontaines, in the Saint-Cyprien suburb of Toulouse. The club was dissolved in 2016 as part of a merger with Toulouse Saint-Jo Football SC to form Toulouse Métropole FC.
History
In 1978, the Toulouse Fontaines Club achieved promotion to the newly formed Division 4, thus leaving their regional league to play in a national competition for the first time. Since then, they never went back to regional football, always playing in D4 and D3, and CFA and CFA 2 after the reform of French leagues.
In 1997, they reached the Round of 32 of the Coupe de France, losing 2–0 to Bordeaux.

Lauren Marie Gardner is an American engineer who is an associate professor and co-director of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. They created the Johns Hopkins University dashboard that is used to share information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gardner was included in Times 100 Most Influential People of 2020.
Early life and education
In 2006, Gardner received a B.S.Arch.E. in architectural engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. In 2008, they received an M.S.E. in civil engineering, also from UT-Austin. In 2011, Gardner earned their PhD in Transportation Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. Them dissertation was on the topic of Network Prediction Models for Coupled Transportation-Epidemiological Systems.
Research and career
In 2011, Gardner was appointed a lecturer at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). They were a member of the UNSW Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovation. This team coined the phrase “bio-secure mobility” to describe the new line of research pursued by Gardner. In summary, Gardner explores how people and things moving around our globalised world spread infectious disease. Them research considers the relationship between epidemiology and transport, making use of network optimisation to describe the spread of disease.
They looked to avoid pandemics by identifying high-risk shipping and air traffic routes. They worked on a computer model that could help government officials in the United States better assess which passengers are likely to suffer from infectious disease and virus outbreaks, and to help them decide where and when to screen passengers. Them models make use of air travel data, the suitability of habitats to vectors, the local transmission of a virus and passenger air travel data. They used the model to analyse the 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas.
During this same time, Gardner was a research fellow with the Australian Government's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centres of Research Excellence (CRE) in Population Health Research at the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at the University of Melbourne.
In 2019, Gardner moved back to the United States to work at Johns Hopkins University, where they serve as Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Here they have studied the United States counties that are most at risk of measles outbreaks. Them analysis concluded that Los Angeles, King County, Washington and Miami-Dade County, Florida were most likely to suffer a measles outbreak .
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gardner recognised that the public, researchers and health authorities needed clear, accessible and up-to-date information. Gardner and their first-year graduate student, Ensheng Dong, created an interactive dashboard that debuted on January 22, 2020. During March 2020, the platform was accessed 1.2 billion times per day. In 2020 Gardner briefed the United States Congress on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

Bayazid Khan Karrani (, ) was the third Sultan of the Bengal Sultanate's Karrani dynasty.
Life
During the reign of their father, Sulaiman Khan Karrani, they were given the command of a force on a campaign to Orissa in 1567. The campaign was successful and the king, who was an Eastern Chalukya from Andhra who had conquered Orissa in the 1550s, was defeated. Bayazidpur, now Bajitpur, in modern-day Kishoreganj District was said to have been named after him.
After their father died on 11 October 1572, they ascended the throne. Assuming power, they broke allegiance and the outward suzerainty with the Mughal Empire which their father had established, and declared independence. They had their name read during the khutbah in the Friday prayer and issued coins with their own name. These actions turned the Afghan chiefs and nobles of their father, against Bayazid - making them an unpopular ruler. Bayazid attempted to banish the Afghan nobles, eventually leading to them conspiring against him.
Death
They only ruled for a few months before they were betrayed and assassinated by their cousin and sister's husband, Hansu. Hansu was later dethroned and killed by Sulaiman Khan's trusted nobles led by Wazir Ludi Khan. Bayazid's younger brother, Daud Khan Karrani, eventually took the power.

Rochelle Park is a historic residential neighborhood in the city of New Rochelle, in Westchester County, New York. The area is bordered by Rochelle Heights on the east, Interstate 95 on the south, New Rochelle City Hall and civic center on the west and Iona College on the north. The Rochelle Heights and Rochelle Park neighborhoods together create the Rochelle Park-Rochelle Heights Historic District.
History
Laid out in 1885, Rochelle Park is particularly distinguished as one of the first planned residential communities in the country. Its overall landscape plan was designed by the architect Nathan F. Barrett for the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Rochelle Park epitomizes the suburban development design principles that Frederick Law Olmsted advocated with the creation of Central Park in New York City: a landscape that provides urban dwellers with the restorative benefits of a picturesque natural environment. Incorporating open space, recreational areas, naturalistic settings, and broad boulevards for public interaction. The architecture of the homes is equally impressive, with many fashionable Shingle Style "cottages" designed with tall towers and attic porches to take advantage of the views towards Long Island Sound located a mile away.
Rochelle Park is essentially rectangular in dimension, with the southeast corner having been clipped from it by the construction of the New York & New Haven Railroad in the 1850s. In the original plan, the parcel was diagonally divided by a wide boulevard (The Boulevard) that entered the park at a stone gateway and ended at a circle ("The Court"). The Boulevard was intended to continue east through a tunnel under the railroad tracks and south to Long Island Sound. This planned connection gave the park the cachet of water access even though the development was a good distance away. This amenity lasted a very short time due to additional subdivisions of the property and the elimination of right-of-way.

Josip Skoblar (born 12 March 1941) is a Croatian former professional football player and manager. They were primarily a forward, and also capable of playing on both wings.
They played for Zadar, OFK Belgrade, Hannover 96, Marseille and NK Rijeka. While playing at Marseille, Skoblar won the French First Division twice (1970–71, 1971–72), 1971 Challenge des Champions and 1972 Coupe de France. They were also the league top goalscorer three seasons in a row (1970–71, 1971–72, 1972–73) and in 1971, they won the European Golden Shoe. In 2009, they were inaugurated into the Olympique de Marseille Hall of Fame and in 2010 they were put into "The Dream Team 110 years of Olympique de Marseille". Skoblar is also part of the all-time XI of OFK Belgrade and NK Rijeka.
At the international level, Skoblar played for Yugoslavia appearing in 32 matches and scoring 11 goals. They were in the national team at the 1962 FIFA World Cup where they finished in fourth place losing to Czechoslovakia in the semi-final.
As a manager, they managed NK Orijent, HNK Rijeka, Hamburger SV, Čelik Zenica, Dinamo Zagreb, Real Valladolid, Famalicão, NK Zagreb, Nîmes, Zadarkomerc, Marseille, Lebanon national team and Hajduk Split, with whom they won two Yugoslav Cups (1987, 1991).
Playing career
Club
Skoblar was born in Privlaka near Zadar (at the time in Banovina of Croatia). They started their career with NK Zadar (1957–58). They got spotted there by OFK Beograd goalie Perica Radenković who was serving their mandatory army stint in Zadar. Radenković recommended Skoblar to club management and the 19-year-old was soon on their way to Belgrade. With OFK Beograd Skoblar won the Yugoslav Cup in 1962 and 1966. In Germany they played for Hannover 96 (1967–70). In 57 games in Bundesliga, they scored 30 goals.
They were willing to play in Marseille, but the chairperson of Hannover didn't want to lose such a player. Marcel Leclerc, chairperson of Marseille, went to Hannover on a quick journey and came back with the player, it was the beginning of a great adventure with Marseille. The player was applauded at the airport by many fans.
In France, Skoblar played for Marseille and was three time top goalscorer in Ligue 1 (1971–73). Skoblar won the European Golden Boot in 1971 for 44 goals in Ligue 1, they still remain as the best scorer in a season in Ligue 1. With Marseille, they won the French league title in 1971, and French league and cup title in 1972. OM fans refer to them as "l'Aigle Dalmate", "l'Aigle Dalmate"/"l'aigle des Dalmates" (The Dalmatian Eagle), or "Monsieur Goal" (Mister Goal).
They left l'OM after the arrival of two Brazilians Jairzinho and Paulo César.
Skoblar joined NK Rijeka in the summer of 1974. They played for the club until 1977 accumulating 37 appearances and scoring 11 goals in league and Cup.
International
For Yugoslavia Skoblar played between 1961 and 1967. In 32 games for Yugoslavia, they scored 11 goals. Skoblar participated in World Cup 1962. Skoblar scored one goal, and Yugoslavia finished in the fourth place.
They first played for the national team on 7 May 1961, for a Friendly match against Hungary. They ended their international career on 7 October 1967 against West Germany, before the end of the Euro 68 qualification competition. The Yugoslavia national football team ended 2nd of the Euro 1968 without him.
Style of play
When they came to OFK Belgrade they were assigned left winger (outside left) position, because of their versatility, technique and speed. While being a winger they continued to score goals although as winger they couldn't completely fulfill their goalscoring potential. While at Marseille they were moved to centre forward while being able to play all forward positions. Skoblar was very well known scoring with headers. They were also a solid dribbler with tremendous speed.
Reputation
Just Fontaine speaking about Josip:
"When I watched them front of the goal, each time, I was thinking, kick from the inside of the left foot, ... from the outside of the right foot ... a header, now! ... they had already done it ... scoring each time, exactly by the only possible way, and in just a split second. In the last 30 years, they have been the only striker that I've seen like that in France."

Managerial career
With their playing career over, they came back to Marseille, and became technical manager in 1977 under manager Ivan "Ðalma" Marković. Due to an internal conflict they left the club after one season to pursue a career as a manager. They began their career as a manager in third tier club NK Orijent in Rijeka. They took the club to the quarter final of the 1981 Yugoslav Cup beating NK Zagreb and OFK Beograd. In the quarter final Orijent lost to Budućnost Titograd of penalties.
Skoblar joined NK Rijeka in May 1983 replacing Marijan Brnčić. They concluded the last six matches of 1982–83 season and saved the club from relegation and finished at 15 place. In their second season at the club Skoblar nearly won the League short three point from first placed Red Star Belgrade, Rijeka finished in fourth place behind Željezničar and Partizan. This result was the club best league result since 1965–66, they also reached the quarter final of Yugoslav Cup and qualified for UEFA Cup.
On 24 October Rijeka beat Real Madrid 3:1 in the second round of the UEFA Cup. This match made Skoblar reputation with the supporters and club rise to a status of legend. In their away match against the Spanish side they lost 3:1 with Real Madrid advancing and eventually winning the Cup. Many of the players and Skoblar themselves have stated that they were cheated from victory by the referee. The season ended with the club at a mid-table eight place, four points shy of a European qualification.
1985–86 season started out poorly with losses in the league and elimination in the second round of the Cup. During the second part of the season Skoblar managed to secure fifth place with the club and secured a place in the UEFA Cup.
Rijeka was eliminated during the first round of the 1986–87 UEFA Cup by Standard Liège. Mid-season Rijeka was in tenth place in the league and had reached the semi final in the Cup. Skoblar left the club in December 1986.
They later became head coach for Hajduk Split with whom they won 2 Yugoslavia Cups. With Hamburger SV they lost DFB Supercup in 1987. In 1988 they managed Čelik Zenica and saved them from relegation.
They also had short stints in Spain with Real Valladolid and Portugal with F.C. Famalicão. They also coached Croatian clubs Dinamo Zagreb, NK Zagreb, Zadarkomerc and HNK Rijeka. At their second stint at Rijeka Skoblar's results were unfavorable so they were sacked after two months in 1995. Later during the year in October they were again set as manager of Rijeka but was again sacked due to results in February 1996. Years later Skoblar stated that they aren't given enough freedom by the (then) president of the club Hrvoje Šarinić to work properly with the team.
 They are employed at the Marseille since 2001 as scout, and they are now close to retirement. During the summer 2001, they were with Marc Levy the co-manager of the team for 3 days, few days before the nomination of Tomislav Ivić. They managed the Lebanon national football team. They joined them in March 2000 and got sacked later in the year (October) after failing to qualify to the second round of the 2000 AFC Asian Cup.

Hopkins County is a county located in the western part of the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 45,423. Its county seat is Madisonville. Hopkins County was created December 9, 1806 from Henderson County. It was named for General Samuel Hopkins, an officer in both the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812, and later a Kentucky legislator and U.S. Congressman.
The Madisonville, Kentucky Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Hopkins County.
The topography ranges from flatlands along the broad river valleys of the Pond River, Tradewater River, and Green River, to hilly and rolling land in the southern and central parts of the county. Coal mines operate in the southern part of Hopkins County and agriculture is a mainstay in the northern part. Major crops are soybeans, corn, and tobacco. Along with coal, resources include oil and natural gas.
History
The earliest inhabitants were prehistoric Native Americans who lived, hunted, and farmed in the region. One of their settlements was a rough stone structure on Fort Ridge, which has since been destroyed by strip mining for coal. Some of the early settlers were Revolutionary War veterans who received land grants for their service from Virginia in the area southwest of the Green River. Among these was Baron Von Steuben, a Prussian officer who had trained George Washington's Continental Army at Valley Forge during the winter of 1776–77. They had received a grant of several thousand acres in the northwest part of the county. According to tradition, Von Steuben was wounded in an Indian attack on their first visit to Kentucky. They then quit-claimed their property. Nevertheless, a salt spring on their grant came to be known as Steuben's Lick. By the 1880s, the community that grew up around the lick was known as Manitou.
Roads in the county often followed animal trails that led to salt and mineral springs. The major traces were those which connected the county seat at Madisonville with Henderson to the north, Hopkinsville to the south, and Russellville to the southeast. Numerous other trails led to the mills and ferries on the Pond and Tradewater Rivers and their tributaries.
On January 3, 1829, Ashbyburg in the northeastern part of the county was incorporated. Located on the Green River, it thrived as a steamboat landing during the 19th century. Other antebellum communities included Nebo, Kentucky, northwest of Madisonville, and Charleston, Kentucky, named after "Free Charles," a black freedman who operated a tavern in the southwest part of the county.
Hopkins County was divided by the American Civil War. Union supporters joined the 35th Kentucky Infantry (Mounted), a regiment recruited locally in late 1863 by James M. Shackelford, while in 1862 Adam Rankin Johnson had recruited Confederate troops for their 10th Kentucky Cavalry Regiment. The courthouse in Madisonville was burned by Kentucky Confederates led by Gen. Hylan Benton Lyon on December 17, 1864, as they passed through western Kentucky, since it was being used to house Union soldiers.
However, the harsh policies imposed by the occupying Union armies caused much resentment and served to increase the sympathy for the Confederate cause. Because of that, the majority of the white population voted for the Democratic Party well into the 20th century.
Farming was the major occupation in Hopkins County for most of the 19th century, with tobacco the leading crop. Around 1837 local blacksmith James Woolfolk found an outcropping of coal on their land.
Post-Civil War
John Bayless Earle, whom the town of Earlington, Kentucky was named for, opened the first coal mine in the county in 1869. Mining did not become a major industry until the Louisville & Nashville Railroad pushed its line southward from Henderson through Madisonville and toward Nashville in 1870.
Two years later, the Elizabethtown and Paducah Railroad (now Paducah and Louisville Railway) entered the county from the east. Many new communities were first established as railroad stops, including Crofton, Hanson, Mortons Gap, Nortonville, and White Plains. Dawson Springs, in the southwestern part of the county, began to thrive in the 1880s as a health resort, but its popularity had faded by the time of the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Economy and politics: late 20th century to present
Beginning in 1968, the majority white voters began to favor Republican Party presidential candidates. Since 2000, they have consistently voted for Republican candidates for the presidency (see table below), and increasingly so in local and statewide elections as well.
By 1970, Hopkins County was the second-largest producer of coal in the Western Coal Field, after Muhlenberg County, and the third-largest coal producer in the entire state after Muhlenberg and Pike County. In 1971 the county also ranked fifth in Kentucky in oil production.
Coal and oil-related businesses were major county employers by 1990. Development of resources was aided by the construction of the north–south Pennyrile Parkway and the east–west Western Kentucky Parkway through the county by the early 1970s. In 1987 farms occupied 41 percent of the land area, with 72 percent of farmland under cultivation.

The 63rd event is faced with controversy over the non-existence of acts from South Korea In one source, it is suspected that government-funded NHK avoided inviting Korean acts because of the territorial disputes over Liancourt Rocks between the South Korean and Japanese governments. Sports Chosun reported on a statement made by an NHK representative. "The fact that President Lee Myung Bak has demanded an apology is a great factor. After this incident occurred, there have been more and more hallyu stars who have stated that 'Dokdo is ours.' Considering this, viewers might have ill feelings about the K-pop stars appearing," said the NHK representative.

"Apocalypse Please" is a song by English alternative rock band Muse, featured on their third studio album, Absolution (2003). A live version of the song was released as a download single on 23 August 2004, from which approximately 70% of all proceeds were donated to Oxfam. The song reached number ten on the first edition of the UK Official Download Chart, announced on 1 September 2004.
Background
"Apocalypse Please" was originally recorded with an orchestral backing, which was removed simply for being, according to Bellamy, "too much." Drummer Dominic Howard described the song as "a very theatrical song about religious fanatics and their wish that their prophecies come true [...] So that they can confirm their religion."
Producer Rich Costey said they wanted the toms on "Apocalypse Please" to sound as "ridiculous and as epic as possible". They had Howard play a pair of close-miked kick drums "to get a low, thumping sound".
Release
Along with the single release, Muse ran a competition to win a signed and framed set list, also in conjunction with Oxfam. In 2005, "Apocalypse Please" was featured on the live video album Absolution Tour; in 2008, it was also featured on the DVD edition of the live album HAARP.

La Gomera Airport () is an airport located near the town of Playa Santiago on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands, southwest by road from the island's capital city, San Sebastián de la Gomera.
Although the runway was completed in 1994, the terminal did not open until 1999. As of August 2019, there are two return flights per day to Tenerife North and two return flights per day to Gran Canaria.
Although from the island capital, the airport was located here to avoid disturbing the Garajonay National Park and avoid the cloudier and foggier climate to the North of the island, whilst the volcanic terrain gives few suitable sites anywhere on La Gomera, although even this site required extensive embankments at both ends of the runway.
History
Aviation in the island of La Gomera started in the 1950s, when a private airfield was constructed. Its name was "El Revolcadero" and it was situated on a hill west of the new airport, GPS 28.023443,-17.242084.
This airfield had a runway (09-27), an hangar and a small stand which was used as control tower. The airfield was for the owner's private use and for cargo and fumigation works.
In 1962, the island had a lot of sanitary assistance problems, so studies to build an airport in the island were started, but this project was not carried out until 1975. However, due to the opening of the Tenerife South Airport and a new maritime line with the island, the project was again delayed.
Finally, in the 1980s, problems with wounded snake-bite evacuations necessitated building an airport in the island, and on 27 July 1987, an agreement for the construction of the airport was signed.
At the end of 1994 the airfield had a runway (09-27), an aircraft parking and a taxi way to the runway. The elected place to build the installations was the "Meseta de los Acantilados" (Plateau Cliffs), which is located 2 kilometers from the old airfield of "El Revolcadero".
At the end of 1991, when Aeropuertos Españoles y Navegación Aérea (AENA), literally "Spanish Airports and Air Navigation", took over the airport, a passenger terminal was built, which was inaugurated in 1992. This passenger terminal has two floors and we can see in it the typical canarian architecture.

Channapha Khamvongsa (born 1973) is the Lao-American former founder and executive director of Legacies of War, a D.C.-based non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to raising awareness about the history and continued effects of the Vietnam War-era bombings in Laos through the use of art, culture, education, and advocacy. In September 2016, President Barack Obama acknowledged Channapha's advocacy efforts in Laos, when they became the first U.S. President to visit the country.
Early life
Khamvongsa was born in the Laotian capital of Vientiane. However, as a result of the Laotian Civil War, in 1979, six-year-old Khamvongsa and their family were forced to flee due to political and economic uncertainty.
A boat took their family of eight across the Mekong River in pairs, with Khamvongsa and their father waiting until their mother contacted them to confirm that they successfully crossed the border into Thailand. When they did not hear from their mother, Khamvongsa's father decided to have a stranger smuggle Khamvongsa across the border alone. Khamvongsa later found the rest of their family in a refugee camp.
Fearing detection by the Thai border patrol, their father attempted to swim across the river. Despite crossing the river, the Thai border patrol detained them and placed them in a holding cell. By chance, a family friend recognized them as they were crossing the river and sent word to Khamvongsa's family of their situation. The friend also knew a supervisor from the refugee camp and after sending someone with money to pay for their release, the eight of them were reunited.
In 1980, after a year in the refugee camp, Khamvongsa and their family left for Falls Creek, Virginia. As a child, Khamvongsa knew very little about the Secret War in Laos. For their parents' generation, the trauma they had endured led many to ignore or simply forget their past experiences. Through their own research later in life, Khamvongsa was able to discover their homeland's violent past and how this past was affecting the present.
Education
Khamvongsa received their Bachelor's of Science Degree in Public Administration from George Mason University in 1996. In 2002 they received a master's degree in Public Policy from Georgetown University.
Career
Prior work experience
Before founding Legacies of War, Khamvongsa worked at the Ford Foundation in the Peace and Social Justice Unit, the Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership at Georgetown University, the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, the Bill and Melinda Gates Millennium Scholars Program, the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging, and at NEO Philanthropy.
In 2003, while at the Ford Foundation, they came into contact with John Cavanagh, who had worked closely with Fred Branfman and their book Voices from the Plain of Jars. After discussing their shared connection to Laos, they gave them a binder filled with drawings made by survivors of the bombings in Laos. The drawings, along with personal narratives, had been collected by an American educational adviser and their Laotian colleague in Vientiane refugee camps in 1970 and 1971. The images, made with pencils, pen, markers, and crayons, depicted the horrific experiences of the survivors that shaped their reality. It was through this interaction that Khamvongsa was motivated to start an organization dedicated to advocating for the removal of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Laos.
Legacies of War
In 2004, Khamvongsa founded Legacies of War, a nonprofit organization fiscally sponsored by NEO Philanthropy, dedicated to bringing attention to UXO awareness, education, and removal in Laos.
In 2010, Khamvongsa spoke in front of the House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment, within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, addressing the need for increased funding for the removal of UXO in Laos.
In September 2016, Khamvongsa and Legacies of War's efforts were directly acknowledged by President Obama during a visit to Laos, the first such visit by a US President. During a speech at the Lao National Cultural Hall, Obama remarked that "for years, they urged the United States to do more to help remove unexploded bombs here in Laos. 'There are many, many problems in this world that might not be able to be solved in a lifetime,' she's said, but this is one we can fix. So, Channapha, we thank you for working to fix this problem."
Through Legacies of War's efforts, annual U.S. funding for the removal of UXO in Laos has increased dramatically from $2.7 million to a $30 million commitment for 2016 to 2018. Khamvongsa's efforts through Legacies of War was covered by multiple news sources, such as the New York Times, PBS, and CBS.
Legacies of War continues to draw attention to the UXO issue in Laos and ensure that the UXO sector in Laos gets the funding needed to make Laos safe again from millions of leftover bomblets. The goal is to reduce the annual number of casualties of UXO in Laos to zero.
Honors and awards

Stranger on the Shore is a British television drama serial first broadcast by the BBC in 1961. It was written by Sheila Hodgson, and produced and directed by Kevin Sheldon. The show is described by some as a "children's serial", being shown on Sunday afternoons. The five-episode series portrays Marie-Hélène Ronsin, a young French teenager, on their first trip to England as an au pair. Speaking some English, but very shy, they live with a family in Brighton, and faces the challenges of culture shock. The series was followed the following year by a sequel, entitled Stranger in the City.
Acker Bilk's "Jenny" was renamed "Stranger on the Shore" when it was chosen as the theme for the series. It was subsequently released as a single, spending 55 weeks in the UK singles chart and becoming the best-selling record of 1962 in the U.S. chart.
Of the five episodes produced, only two survived the BBC's junkings. The sequel series, Stranger in the City, was also subject to having all six of its episodes wiped, and is completely lost.

The ProFile (codenamed Pippin) was the first hard disk drive produced by Apple Computer, initially for use with the Apple III personal computer. The original model had a formatted capacity of 5 MB and connected to a special interface card that plugged into an Apple III slot. In 1983, Apple offered a ProFile interface card for the Apple II, with software support for Apple ProDOS and Apple Pascal.
Additionally, in 1983, Apple introduced the Lisa computer, which was normally sold with a ProFile. The ProFile could be connected to the built-in parallel port of the Lisa, or to a port on an optional dual-port parallel interface card. Up to three such interface cards could be installed, so in principle up to seven ProFile drives could be used on a Lisa.
The 5 MB ProFile was Apple's first hard drive, and was introduced in September 1981 at a price of . Later a 10 MB model was offered, but required an upgraded PROM/interface card to recognize the additional 5 MB.
Internally, the ProFile consisted of a bare Seagate ST-506 stepper motor drive and mechanism, without the usual Seagate electronics, a digital and an analog circuit board designed and manufactured by Apple, and a power supply.
Later Lisa models could be configured with an internal 10 MB "Widget" voice-coil drive with a proprietary controller designed and built entirely by Apple, but the Widget was never offered as an external product for use with other Apple computers.
Apple did not offer another hard drive until it released the Hard Disk 20 designed specifically for the Macintosh 512K in September 1985 which could not be used on the Apple II or III families, or Lisa series. The ProFile could not be used on the Macintosh or the Apple IIc (for which Apple never offered an external hard disk drive of any kind).
By September 1986, the ProFile would be superseded by the introduction of the first cross-platform Hard Disk 20SC SCSI-based drive for the Macintosh and interface card for the Apple II family (excluding the IIc series, which had no SCSI interface of any kind) and Lisa/XL series.

Anna Alchuk (28 March 195521 March 2008) was a Russian poet and visual artist. An admirer summarized their work as "a free-spirited romp across complex and significant ideas about personhood, identity, representation, linguistic performance, and political action."
They were married for 33 years to the philosopher Michail Ryklin. At the time of their death the couple were living in Berlin where Ryklin was employed as a visiting professor at the university. The assessment that Alchuk's death had been a suicide was generally accepted, but did not go entirely unquestioned.
Anna Alchuk was the name under which they worked as an artist, and by which they are identified in many English language sources. However, fuller variants of their name are also used in some sources.
Life
Anna Alchuk Mikhalchuk (А́нна Алекса́ндровна Михальчу́к) was born into a Jewish family in in the Sakhalin Oblast in the Soviet Far East. Them parents were working on Sakhalin as geologists. Anna grew up in another rich mining region, in Vorkuta in the North Urals. They identified with their grandmother whom they never met, since the old lady spent the last thirty years of their life locked away in a psychiatric institution.
In 1973 they met Michail Ryklin whom they married in 1975. While Ryklin worked for their doctorate which focused on Claude Lévi-Strauss and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, between 1973 and 1978 Alchuk studied History at Lomonosov University (as Moscow's principal university was known at that time). During the build-up to the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1987 and 1988 they were a co-publisher of the samizdat publications "Paradigma" ("Парадигма") and "MDP" ("МДП"). In 1983 Alchuk's mother, Maja Koljada, had been denounced and accused of "spreading untrue facts, contrary to better knowledge, which denigrate the Soviet state and social system". Koljada had been sent away to a labour camp hundreds of kilometers away from their family.
Towards the end of the 1980s they got together with a group of Moscow artists and conceptualist poets, to take part in the exhibitions of the new conceptual art movement. Later they participated in music and poetry stage performances, for instance with the cult musician Sergey Letov and the . Them own first volume of poetry was published in 1994. During this period they were the organiser of numerous exhibitions and performances in which music and poetry were combined.
Anna Alchuk was a member of the Russian section of PEN International and of the Academy of Zaum. Them poems and visual works were reproduced in (a Russian language literary almanac published annually in New York) and . I essays and articles featured in leading Russian journals, including . They were the editor-compiler of a collection of articles entitled "Женщина и визуальные знаки" ("Woman and visual signs") which appeared in 2000. During the final years of the twentieth century, theirs became an increasingly international presence in the contemporary arts world, featuring in exhibitions not just in Russia, but also in Britain, Germany, Hungary and Sweden.
Life turned bitter early in 2003. In January an exhibition opened in Moscow under the challenging title . The focus of the exhibition was on the church. A few days after it opened, on 18 January, the exhibition was trashed by six people purporting to represent Christian Orthodox believers. The works of the 40 exhibitors were destroyed with paint. A statement appeared on the wall: "May you be damned". Two of the vandals, Lyukshin and Zyakin, were arrested at the scene and a criminal trial took place. What appalled many in Russia and, as news of the trial spread, many international observers, was the fact that the authorities proceeded not against the vandals but against the exhibition organisers, Yuri Samodurov and Ludmila Vasilovskaya. A third person was on trial, one of the more high-profile exhibitors, Anna Alchuk Mikhalchuk. (On 23 August 2003 a Moscow court determined that Lyukshin and Zyakin had no case to answer.)
The lengthy trial and the events surrounding it hit Alchuk badly. Them husband was able to chronicle their experiences. Overnight their circle of friends halved in size. They were avoided. Alchuk found themselves identified in the Russian press not as an adventurous artist and lyric poet but as a political figurehead of opposition. There was no protection offered from the constant anonymous threats, many of which were couched in nationalist and anti-semitic terms. The experience of social isolation and the growing belief that if the authorities said they were guilty of something then they must be, tore away at their self-image. It was the start of a long period of destabilisation. (The outcome of the trial was that Samodurov and Vasilovskaya were found guilty of inciting religious and ethic hostility under Article 282 of the Criminal Code. Each was fined one thousand rubles. Alchuk was found "not guilty" and acquitted.)
Constant threats by telephone and by letter continued: the threats were mostly of violence. Leaving the house became an ordeal. There were online death threats. The murder of Anna Politkovskaya shook their badly. Michail Ryklin later wrote, "Once acquitted by the court, they saw themselves facing a community for whom the things for which they had fought and made sacrifices (initially it almost seemed and if this was about a common call for freedom of artistic expression) had completely lost their meaning. Over these years the art scene resigned itself to its defeat and even managed to profit considerably as a result. It was, it transpired, far easier to endure being a target of religious fanatics than having to put up with the repressive passivity of most of their fellow artists." Meanwhile, their daughter and grandchild in Moscow waited in vain for Alchuk to call. Over the next few years Ryklin and Alchuk concluded that they no longer had a future in Moscow. In November 2007 they moved to Berlin: Michail Ryklin accepted a post as a visiting professor at the Humboldt University.
Death
On March 21, 2008 Anna Alchuk left the couple's Berlin apartment, telling their husband they were going to the shops to buy washing powder. It was a public holiday and the shops would be closed, but Ryklin, their nose in a book, did not register that till later. It was wet, cold and windy and they were dressed appropriately. Three hours later they noticed they had left their Mobile phones behind. Three weeks later, on 12 April, they were visited by two detectives. A body had been found in the Spree. They recognised the wedding ring when they were shown a photograph of it. Stones had been found in the coat pockets, together with a water-damaged picture of Manjushri. (The couple shared an interest in Buddhism.) Blood tests indicated a sleeping drug intake twenty times the doze conventionally prescribed for insomnia. The larynx was damaged. There was a puncture on the right side of the body with a broken needle in it. A hat had been drawn down firmly over the forehead and eyes.
The day after their wife disappeared Michail Ryklin shared some ideas with the investigating authorities in a letter. They urged them to take more seriously the possibility that there might be a political aspect to their disappearance: "Through their critical engagement with Russian society, and because of their Jewish provenance, Mrs Mikhalchuk was exposed to daily repression and threats of violence. Crimes of political violence against critics of the Russian government have increased massively in recent years. So you should not rule out a politically motivated or antisemitic crime in this case."
In 2014 Michail Ryklin published a book, described by one reviewer as "a record of grief and love", about their late wife. They had worked through police investigation reports of around 100 pages. They had worked through 27 numbered note books in which Anna, like most serious writers, had confided their thoughts and dreams, insights and, increasingly, their nightmares. They had discovered many things about Anna, about himself, and about their marriage, that they had not known before. One conclusion that they had quickly reached for themselves was that, in an immediate sense, their wife's death had indeed been a suicide.

The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day is an English-language encyclopedia containing over 15,000 articles on the history, culture, and state of Judaism up to the early 20th century. The encyclopedia's managing editor was Isidore Singer and the editorial board was chaired by Isaac K. Funk and Frank H. Vizetelly.
The work's scholarship is still highly regarded. The American Jewish Archives deemed it "the most monumental Jewish scientific work of modern times", and Rabbi Joshua L. Segal said "for events prior to 1900, it is considered to offer a level of scholarship superior to either of the more recent Jewish encyclopedias written in English."
It was originally published in 12 volumes between 1901 and 1906 by Funk & Wagnalls of New York, and reprinted in the 1960s by KTAV Publishing House. It is now in the public domain.
History
Conception
Singer conceived of a Jewish encyclopedia in Europe and proposed creating an Allgemeine Encyklopädia für Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums in 1891. They envisioned 12 volumes, published over 10 to 15 years, at a cost of 50 dollars as a set. They would contain scientific and unbiased articles on ancient and modern Jewish culture. This proposal received good press coverage and interest from the Brockhaus publishing company. After the House of Rothschild in Paris, consulted by Zadoc Kahn, offered to back the project with only eight percent of the minimum funds requested by Brockaus, the project was abandoned. Following the Dreyfus affair and associated unpleasantness, Singer emigrated to New York City.
Initially believing that American Jews could do little more than provide funding for their project, Singer was impressed by the level of scholarship in the United States. They wrote a new prospectus, changing the title of their planned encyclopedia to Encyclopedia of the History and Mental Evolution of the Jewish Race. Their radical ecumenism and opposition to orthodoxy upset many of their Jewish readers; nevertheless they attracted the interest of publisher Isaac K. Funk, a Lutheran minister who also believed in integrating Judaism and Christianity. Funk agreed to publish the encyclopedia on the condition that it remain unbiased on issues which might seem unfavorable for Jews. Singer accepted and was established in an office at Funk & Wagnalls on .
Publication of the prospectus in 1898 created a severe backlash, including accusations of poor scholarship and of subservience to Christians. Kaufmann Kohler and Gotthard Deutsch, writing in American Hebrew, highlighted Singer's factual errors, and accused them of commercialism and irreligiosity. Now considering that the project could not succeed with Singer at the helm, Funk & Wagnalls appointed an editorial board to oversee creation of the encyclopedia.
Editorial board
Funk & Wagnalls assembled an editorial board between October 1898 and March 1899. Singer toned down their ideological rhetoric, indicated their desire to collaborate, and changed the work's proposed title to The Jewish Encyclopedia. Despite their reservations about Singer, rabbi Gustav Gottheil and Cyrus Adler agreed to join the board, followed by Morris Jastrow, Frederick de Sola Mendes, and two published critics of the project: Kauffmann Kohler and Gotthard Deutsch
Theologian and Presbyterian minister George Foot Moore was added to the board for balance. Soon after work started, Moore withdrew and was replaced by Baptist minister Crawford Toy. Last was added the elderly Marcus Jastrow, mostly for their symbolic imprimatur as America's leading Talmudist. In March 1899, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which had been contemplating a competing project, agreed to discuss collaborating with Funk & Wagnalls—thus securing the position of the Jewish Encyclopedia as the only major project of its kind. Shuly Rubin Schwartz describes the payment scheme arranged at this time as follows:
Other editors participating in all 12 volumes were Gotthard Deutsch, Richard Gottheil, Joseph Jacobs, Kaufmann Kohler, Herman Rosenthal, and Crawford Howell Toy. Morris Jastrow, Jr. and Frederick de Sola Mendes assisted with volumes I to II; Marcus Jastrow with volumes I, II, and III; Louis Ginzberg with the first four volumes; Solomon Schechter with volumes IV through VII; Emil G. Hirsch with volumes IV through XII; and Wilhelm Bacher with volumes VIII through XII. William Popper served as assistant revision editor and chief of translation for volumes IV through XII.
The editors plunged into their enormous task and soon identified and solved some inefficiencies with the project. Article assignments were shuffled around and communication practices were streamlined. Joseph Jacobs was hired as a coordinator. They also wrote four hundred articles and procured many of the encyclopedia's illustrations. Herman Rosenthal, an authority on Russia, was added as an editor. Louis Ginzberg joined the project and later became head of the rabbinical literature department.
The board naturally faced many difficult editorial questions and disagreements. Singer wanted specific entries for every Jewish community in the world, with detailed information about, for example, the name and dates of the first Jewish settler in Prague. Conflict also arose over what types of Bible interpretation should be included, as some editors feared that Morris Jastrow's involvement in "higher criticism" would lead to unfavorable treatment of scripture.
Scholarship
The scholarly style of The Jewish Encyclopedia aligns directly to the , an approach to Jewish scholarship and religion that flourished in 19th-century Germany. The encyclopedia may be regarded as the culmination of this movement, which sought to modernize scholarly methods in Jewish research. In the 20th century, the movement's members dispersed to Jewish Studies departments in the United States and Israel.
The scholarly authorities cited in the encyclopedia—besides the classical and medieval exegetes—are almost uniformly figures, such as Leopold Zunz, Moritz Steinschneider, Solomon Schechter, Wilhelm Bacher, Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport, David Zvi Hoffmann, and Heinrich Graetz. Its scholarly style is evident by the encyclopedia's almost obsessive attention to manuscript discovery, editing, publication, comparison, and dating. These endeavors were among the foremost interests of Wissenschaft scholarship.
The Jewish Encyclopedia is an English-language work, but the vast majority of the encyclopedia's contemporary sources are German-language sources, since this was the mother tongue of the scholars and the lingua franca of Biblical scholarship in general in that period. Of all works cited not in German—usually the more classical works—the largest part are either in Hebrew or Arabic. The only heavily cited English-language source of contemporary scholarship is Schechter's publications in The Jewish Quarterly Review.
The significance of the work's publication in English rather than German or Hebrew is captured by Harry Wolfson, writing in 1926:
The editors and authors of The Jewish Encyclopedia proved prescient in their choice of language, since within that same span of 25 years, English rose to become the dominant language of academic Jewish scholarship and among Jews worldwide. Wolfson continues that "if a Jewish Encyclopedia in a modern language were planned for the first time, the choice would undoubtedly have fallen upon English."
Editions
The unedited text of the original can be found at The Jewish Encyclopedia website. The site offers both JPEG facsimiles of the original articles and Unicode transcriptions of all texts.
The search capability is somewhat handicapped by the fact that the search mechanism fails to take into account the decision to maintain all diacritical marks in the transliterated Hebrew and Aramaic from the 1901–1906 text, which used a large number of diacriticals not in common use today. Thus, for example, to successfully search for "Halizah"—the ceremony by which the widow of a brother who has died childless released their brother-in-law from the obligation of marrying her—one would have to know that they have transliterated this as "Ḥaliẓah". The alphabetic index ignores diacriticals so it can be more useful when searching for an article whose title is known.
The scholarly apparatus of citation is thorough, but can be a bit daunting to contemporary users. Books that might have been widely known among scholars of Judaism at the time the encyclopedia was written (but which are quite obscure to a lay reader today) are referred to by author and title, but with no publication information and often without indication of the language in which they were written.
The Jewish Encyclopedia was heavily used as a source by the 16-volume Jewish Encyclopedia in Russian, published by Brockhaus and Efron in Saint Petersburg between 1906 and 1913.
