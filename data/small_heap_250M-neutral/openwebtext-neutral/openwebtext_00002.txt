Greek prime minister puts figure on new bailout needs for first time as they struggle to get country behind austerity measures
Greece will need a second international financial bailout of the same magnitude as last year's €110bn (£97bn), in order to avoid a tumultuous debt default, the prime minister, George Papandreou, has conceded while mounting a last-ditch appeal to parliament and the nation to back their austerity programme.
Appealing for a vote of confidence in their newly reshuffled government, the Socialist party leader warned that, without further aid from the EU and IMF, Athens's cash reserves would soon run out, inviting a financial crisis that European officials have warned would rapidly contaminate the international financial system.
"I ask for a vote of confidence because we are at a critical juncture," said Papandreou in a speech opening a marathon parliamentary debate which will culminate with the crucial vote on Tuesday.
The sacrifices required for that aid – more cost-cutting, tax increases and job losses, plus massive privatisations – were infinitely better than a default, they said, as thousands of austerity-weary Greeks protested outside the 300-seat parliament.
"The debt and deficits are national problems that have brought Greece into a state of [diminished sovereignty], one that may have protected us from bankruptcy, but which we need to get out of.The consequences of a violent bankruptcy, or exit from the euro, would be immediately catastrophic for households, the banks and the country's credibility … the sacrifices people are making are paying off," they said.
It was the first time that Papandreou or any Greek official had broached the subject of how big the new bailout would be.
The admission, after weeks of speculation over the size of the package, highlighted the state of the economy despite it receiving regular cash injections from the €110bn rescue agreed last May, the biggest bailout in western history.
Athens's debt, which stood at €340bn in December, was estimated to have exceeded €355bn, the equivalent of 150% of GDP, in April. By comparison, the government's annual income is almost one-tenth of that, at around €40bn.
Papandreou called the vote after a first attempt to pass more austerity measures in return for the aid met with fierce opposition from their own Pasok party. After a flurry of defections and the collapse of talks aimed at a coalition government with the opposition, they moved ahead with a radical reshuffle of their cabinet, appointing Evangelos Venizelos, a party heavyweight and political rival, as finance minister to navigate Greece through its worst crisis in modern times.
A poll published in the To Vima newspaper showed 47% of respondents vehemently opposed to the new €28bn cost-cutting plan, whose centrepiece is an ambitious privatisation drive that aims to raise an additional €50bn by 2015.
Before attending their first summit of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg where the details of a new three-year rescue deal for Greece were discussedon Sunday, Venizelos promised austerity measures would be meted out fairly. But unions are preparing a series of strikes.
Papandreou rejected a call from the conservative opposition leader, Antonis Samaras, to step down. Instead, in an attempt to win over voters, who identify politicians with corruption, Papandreou said they would call a referendum later this year on changes to the "political system": an overhaul of the constitution, and the abolishing of practices such as the immunity enjoyed by MPs, a source of the discontent that has led protestors to scream "thieves" outside parliament.
However writing in today's Daily Telegraph Boris Johnson, the London mayor, called for Greece to be allowed to go bankrupt, leave the euro and "forge a new economic identity with the new drachma".
"The euro has exacerbated the financial crisis by encouraging some countries to behave as recklessly as the banks themselves," Johnson said.
The conservative opposition leader, Antonis Samaras, called for Papandreou to step down to pave the way for elections and a renegotiation of the bailout. But Papandreou called for the opposition to "stop fighting in these critical times, stop sending the image that the country is being torn apart".
Classical music and tagging
Pop music is called pop music because it is popular.
Classical music is not pop music because it is not popular.
Most interfaces are designed with pop music in mind.
You can browse your collection in all kind of ways: artist, album, song, genre but most of the time not by composition.
An artist makes a couple of songs. They are released on an album.
Album Artist Title Freak out Frank Zappa Song 1 Song 2 Song 3 Etc.
In classical music things are a bit different.
Often there is more than one composition on an album.
Often there is work by different composers on an album e.g. works by Schubert and Brahms.
Album Album Artist Artist Composer Composition Title Schubert and Brahms L'Archibudelli Anner Bylsma Vera Beths Jos van Immerseel Schubert, Franz (1797-1828) String Trio in B flat major D 581 1 Allegro 2 Adagio 3 Menuetto 4 Finale Anner Bylsma Vera Beths Jurgen Kussmaul Marilyn McDonald Guus Jeukendrup Brahms, Johannes (1833-1897) String Sextet No.1 Op.18 in B flat Major (1860) I Allegro ma non troppo II Andante ma moderato III Scherzo IV Rondo
We need tags for composer and composition.
Not only do we need these tags, we also need a media player that can read them and display them in the interface
Composer
On the internet one can fins all kind of workarounds like “add composer to the performers”, "use Album Artist for performers and Artist for composer", etc.
Album Album Artist Artist Composition Title String quartets by Schumann and Brahms Alban Berg Quartet Schumann String quartet no.1 1 Allegro 2 Adagio 3 Menuetto 4 Finale Brahms String quartet no.1 1 Allegro 2 Adagio 3 Menuetto 4 Finale
Almost all tagging schema (each file format has its own tagging schema) support the Composer tag.
Today a lot of media players do support this tag as well.
Just pick the right media player on your PC and portables.
A tagger like SongKong even has a feature to remove the composer from the Artist tag!
I do think this “problem” solved.
If the media player doesn't know the composer tag, find another.
Compostition
Unfortunately there is no starndard tag "Composition".
A common work-around is to add the composition to Title.
This is what a lot of internet databases like FreeDB do.
Album Artist Title String quartets by Schumann and Brahms Schumann String quartet no.1 - 1 Allegro String quartet no.1 - 2 Adagio String quartet no.1 - 3 Menuetto String quartet no.1 - 4 Finale Brahms String quartet no.1 - 1 Allegro String quartet no.1 - 2 Adagio String quartet no.1 - 3 Menuetto String quartet no.1 - 4 Finales
At least the composition is documented a bit.
Sometimes this is only done for the first movement. If you do a search on “Schumann String Quartet” you won't get the entire composition but the first movement only. This can be solved by adding the composition to each movement but I do think it is a bit untidy.
Splitting
Do you care what is on an album?
I don't. I'm interested in compositions not in a more or less arbitrary decision by a record company about what to fit on a CD given its size.
Simply split the album in individual compositions by replacing the album title.
Before you do, you can copy the album title to another tag e.g. Comment or a custom tag (if the media player supports this) like Original Album to preserve this information.
It is convenient to have the original title at hand if you want to do a manual album lookup in an online database.
Album Artist Title String quartet no.1 Schumann Allegro Adagio Menuetto Finale
Album Artist Title String quartet no.1 Brahms Allegro Adagio Menuetto Finale
By doing so you come a bit closer to the “pop model” and you have a nice overview of all the compositions.
If you do have the famous Scott Ross 34 CD boxset with all Scarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas, you end up with 555 compositions. This might clutter up the interface a little.
If you want to do a internet database lookup, it will fail most of the time as these databases expect an entire CD.
Custom tag
Often media players allow for custom tags.
You can create one like Composition.
Album Artist Composition Title String quartets by Schumann and Brahms Schumann, Alban Berg Quartet String quartet no.1 1 Allegro 2 Adagio 3 Menuetto 4 Finale Brahms, Alban Berg Quartet String quartet no.1 1 Allegro 2 Adagio 3 Menuetto 4 Finale
In this scenario you preserve the original value of the album but your custom tag might not work with other media players.
What if you sync to a portable or use streaming audio using DLNA?
Most of the time your custom tag is not supported.
A solution might be to use the standard tag CONTENTGROUP.
It is a tag available in various file formats.
ID3v2 / WMA tag fields
Name in Mp3tag ID3v2.3 ID3v2.4 WMA iTunes WMP 10 Winamp COMPOSER TCOM " WM/Composer Composer COMPOSERSORT TSOC " Composer Sort Order CONDUCTOR TPE3 " WM/Conductor Conductor CONTENTGROUP TIT1 " WM/ContentGroup Description Grouping Music category description
Source: MP3Tag
Using this tag we get
Album Album Artist Artist Composer Content Title Schubert Piano Trios L'Archibudelli Anner Bylsma Vera Beths Jos van Immerseel Schubert, Franz (1797-1828) String Trio in B flat major D 581 1 Allegro 2 Adagio 3 Menuetto 4 Finale Schubert, Franz (1797-1828) String Trio in B flat major D 898 1 Allegro 2 Adagio 3 Menuetto 4 Finale
This is a nice solution but at the present not all media players do support this tag.
Even if they do, the quation is how it handles this tag.
It should handle it the same as Album.
Album is a matter of grouping files as much as Composition is a matter of grouping files.
Multiple performances
You might have some overlap in your collection e.g. Beethoven's violin sonata no.1 performed by Gidon Kremer/Martha Argerich and by Vladimir Ashkenazy/Itzhak Perlman.
If your media player thinks tracks belong to the same album if both Album Title and Album Artist are the same you might get something like this:
Album Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1
and if you expand this to tracks you might end up with:
Album Song Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 1 Allegro Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 1 Allegro Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 2 Adagio Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 2 Adagio Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 3 Menuetto Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 3 Menuetto Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 4 Finale Beethoven - Violin sonata no.1 4 Finale
You get all the first movements, then the second movements, etc.
Adding the name of the composers and the performers to the composition makes your albums media player proof but the title might become too long to be fully displayed in the interface.
Album Beethoven - Violin Sonata No. 9 in A major (Kreutzer Sonata) - Kremer/Argerich Beethoven - Violin Sonata No. 9 in A major (Kreutzer Sonata) - Perlman/Ashkenazy
This I call a universal solution because by making the name of the Album unique it will work on almost any device even those that use Album Title only to define an album.
The downside is the title becomes very long. Often too long to be readable in the interface.
I don't endorse this practice but I do think it is a work-around often needed because most media players are built with pop music in mind.
Multiple values
Often you have various combinations of performers like:
Gideon Kremer
Gideon Kremer/ Martha Argerich
Gideon Kremer/ Olaf Mustone
Harnoncourt / Gideon Kremer
Martha Argerich
Martha Argerich / Harnoncourt / Gideon Kremer
etc.
This makes it hard to find all the works performed by e.g. Kremer in a sorted list.
Some media players support multiple values.
You enter the names separated by a semicolon.
An alternative is simply not to bother.
If your media player has a good search function, typing e.g. "Kremer" will simply yield all the tracks they are involved in.
Sorting
In classical music the movements (title) are often labelled using numbers.
You can do without as long as the media player sorts by track number.
But some simply sorts alphabetically by title, so it is a good practice to use numbers.
A common practice is using roman numbers.
As long as you remain below VIII, they sort well alphabetically.
I II III IV IX V VI VII VIII
Using 'normal' numbers might also give problems if the sorting is done alphabetically.
1 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Some media players support "smart" sorting.
They sort the numbers in the right order although the content of the tag is character.
If not, the only thing you can do is to prefix with a zero.
This applies to compositions as well.
Piano Sonata No.1 Op.2/1 in F minor (1793-5)
Piano Sonata No.10 Op.14/2 in G Major (1799)
Piano Sonata No.2 Op.2/2 in A Major (1793-5)
....
If you prefix you don't have this problem.
Piano Sonata No.01 Op.2/1 in F minor (1793-5)
Piano Sonata No.02 Op.2/2 in A Major (1793-5)
....
Piano Sonata No.10 Op.14/2 in G Major (1799)
But I don't like these leading zeros.
Likewise Opus/Catalog
In case of Bach you need four digits to get the BWV sorted right.
Software
Tagging classical music is a lot of work.
Sometimes you can save yourself a lot of typing by using scripts.
Advanced taggers like MP3Tag allow you to use formulas for bulk editing.
At the present I use MusiCHI for classical.
Epilogue
Today a lot of media players support the composer tag.
Even the one on my Android smart phone does.
iTunes
In October 2016 iTunes started supporting typical classical tags as Work and Movement.
If iTunes does it, others will follow.
How to tag?
There is no perfect solution.
If you use a player like MusicBee you can make all kind of custom tags and tailor the views to your needs.
If you sync to a portable you have to take into account its capabilities.
If you use various media players, keep portability of tags in mind.
Search
You might go for an elaborate tagging schema but if you have a media player with a good search function it is often more important that the information is in some searchable tag then in a specific tag.
If you browse a list it is very inconvenient to have both “Gidon Kremer” and “Kremer, Gidon” in the list.
If you do a search on "Kremer" you will find both anyway.
Over time I became a bit less fixated about my tagging schemes.
If the search finds it, who cares?

As Ezekiel Elliott's appeal hearing wraps up, there are a couple of points of note. First, while arbitrator Harold Henderson could reduce the suspension, there is a basis to keep it at six games. As well, even if they lose their appeal, the Dallas Cowboys running back could still start Week 1 against the New York Giants. While I wouldn't bet on it, Elliott suiting up for the regular season opener is one possible outcome.
Six Game Suspension Could Stand
As a basis to conclude that a reduced suspension is possible some are pointing to Henderson's decision in the Greg Hardy arbitration. In that case, Henderson did indeed reduce Greg Hardy's suspension from ten games to four for their horrendous physical abuse of Nicole Holder. That case, however, is distinguishable from that of Elliott. Hardy was suspended under the old personal conduct policy, which did not expressly provide for a minimum suspension. Since the older policy was silent on suspension length, Henderson properly relied on the NFL's past practice, and concluded that Hardy's suspension should be reduced since it represented too dramatic a departure from precedent.
Elliott, however, was suspended under the new Personal Conduct Policy, which expressly provides for a baseline suspension of six games (with consideration given to any aggravating or mitigating factors). That together with the broad discretionary powers accorded Roger Goodell under Article 46 of the CBA, it's more likely than not that the six game suspension will stand.
Now let's be clear: the suspension could be reduced (to say four games), but given the express provision of the Personal Conduct Policy regarding a minimum suspension, don't be surprised if the suspension stands. Ultimately, the more likely scenario is an all or nothing proposition: either the suspension stays at 6 games or is entirely vacated.
Elliott Could Still Play Week 1
Elliott was suspended six games under the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy after the league concluded that there was "substantial and persuasive evidence supporting a finding" that Elliott physically assaulted Tiffany Thompson five times the week of July 16, 2016.
Elliott has denied assaulting Thompson and has noted they were never arrested or charged. Instead, their lawyers and the NFLPA have attacked Thompson's credibility alleging, in part, a plot to extort Elliott over sex tapes.
Should the NFLPA and Elliott be dissatisfied with Henderson's ruling (be it maintaining the suspension or reducing it), they could rush to court and seek a preliminary injunction temporarily setting aside the suspension pending the disposition of the case. Tom Brady did it with success and Elliott may try the same maneuver.
This case, however, is not like Brady's, which involved an equipment violation and failure to cooperate with an investigation. Instead, it deals with domestic violence and invokes a policy with a clear punishment.
Getting a court to temporarily set aside the suspension will be tough. Elliott will need to establish that they would be irreparably harmed if the injunction is not granted (i.e., harm that can't be compensated with money). Elliott would argue that irreparable harm in this case is being unable to get back their missed games. On the flip side, the NFL would make the argument that the harm could indeed be repaired by way of paying Elliott back their lost wages.
As well, in order to get the injunction, Elliott would need to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the case. This is where Elliott is likely to face their biggest challenge. The NFL seemingly did its due diligence and consulted with experts in the field of domestic violence. As well, the CBA provides Goodell with broad discretionary powers when it comes to discipline.
Elliott can't focus on the sufficiency of the evidence. Rather, Elliott will need to allege that the appeal process was fundamentally unfair and as a result Elliott was deprived of due process and a chance to fairly make out their case. A failure to meet this procedural standard can result in an arbitration award being overturned. For example, Elliott could argue that they were not afforded due process in light of the NFL's refusal to allow them to examine their accuser Thompson. This is a fair argument but may not be enough to convince a court to grant the injunction.
It's also important to appreciate that courts are generally reluctant to interfere with the decisions of arbitrators. Courts provide substantial deference to arbitrators and will only vacate an award in exceptional circumstances, including cases where an arbitrator has exceeded their or their authority.
Finally, for the timing to work as far as suiting up for Week 1, Henderson will need to issue their decision by early next week. While that seems possible, the hearing will continue through Thursday. So at this point, it's unclear when a decision will issue.
Ultimately, while it's possible Elliott could be in the lineup to start the season, I wouldn't bet on it.
NBKW Partners LLC is building the project, being designed by GDA Architects.
Some of the one-, two- and three-bedroom condos will have views of White Rock Lake.
The development will include a cardio and fitness center, a saltwater swimming pool, a dog park and a roof deck overlooking Lakewood and White Rock Lake.
"The Drake at White Rock Lake will be the newest condominium project being built in Dallas," said Al Coker of Al Coker & Associates, which is marketing the project. "Our prospective homeowners will include first-time buyers, empty nesters and those who want to enjoy life in a neighborhood enhanced with nearby entertainment, nature's bounty and outdoor leisure activities."
The planned home development will be one of the few condominium projects outside Dallas' Uptown and Park Cities area.
The developers have begun preselling the units and have not announced a construction schedule.
Coker said the project will be one of the most affordable condo developments in Dallas.
Two days ago, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse held a Q&A on Quora (the popular Internet forum that syndicates the answers to major news outlets). Today, that Ripple news managed to send XRP prices up 9.99% while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin all dropped.
So what exactly did they say?
Well, there was a lot of good stuff—he talked about what's driving the long-term Ripple price prediction, for example—but their most relevant answer came in response to a question about SWELL.
For those unfamiliar with SWELL, it is a conference. But not just any conference; it is the first inaugural conference hosted by Ripple. And it will be hosted in the same city, on the same day, as a conference hosted by Ripple's main competitor in the settlements business, SWIFT.

The question was: “Can we expect any significant announcements during the SWELL event?”
At first, it didn't seem like Mr. Garlinghouse was willing to respond. They said, “Ha. You think I'm gonna let the cat out of the bag today?” It could have ended there, but…
They added, “Suffice it to say, yes – but Monica has me under strict embargo.”
And there you have it: “Suffice it to say, yes.” Five little words that drove a wedge between XRP and Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
Investors had been hoping to hear big news at SWELL, and now that they'd heard confirmation from the horse's mouth, there was no stopping the upside in XRP prices.
But why did Ripple prices react the next day rather than immediately? I can't say for sure, but it might be that Forbes ran the story a day after Quora, and Forbes is the bigger website.
To put it in perspective, the number of people who'd seen the response jumped 144% from Day 1 to Day 2.
In any case, the Ripple to USD exchange rate is sitting at around $0.224675. The Ripple to Bitcoin rate, meanwhile, jumped roughly 11.72% to near 0.00005346 BTC.
Analyst Take:
I've been saying for months that investors should price XRP based on Ripple news, not industry news. Now that we're starting to see that shift take place, I'm confident that XRP will accelerate to its near-term Ripple price prediction of $0.40.

Rising Up and Rising Down
KAFRANBEL, Syria — The Syrian revolution's heart — not yet ravished by the regime or Islamist extremists — beats on in the northern town of Kafranbel, where a group of dedicated activists has captured the world's attention through witty posters and banners that reflect the state of the revolt since spring 2011. And even as the Syrian narrative has increasingly focused on the extremists or an international plan to dismantle the Assad regime's chemical stockpiles, the artists of Kafranbel have been engaged in their own struggle — to win back the support of residents of their own town.
The 40-year-old Raed Faris and their partner, 33-year-old Ahmad Jalal, are the creative duo behind the banners. Faris — a tall man with a booming laugh — writes the banners, while Jalal, quiet and shy, draws the cartoons. Together, they spend their time brainstorming, researching, and connecting with others on how to display Syria's tragedy to the world.
The banners express sophisticated geopolitical analysis in the simplest of forms. They are often inspired by iconic pop culture references: Faris and Jalal have used a Pink Floyd album cover, the Titanic movie poster, and even The Lord of the Rings to describe what is happening in Syria. No side in the crisis was spared — not the Syrian regime and its allies, not the Western powers and the United Nations, not the exiled Syrian opposition, and not even the radical jihadists who eventually came to live among the activists.
Kafranbel's messages traveled the world. A large collection of the posters and banners was smuggled out of Syria to protect them from being destroyed, and they were displayed as exhibitions across the United States and Europe. One poignant banner — carried in front of the White House last spring on the second anniversary of the revolution — adapted and adopted Martin Luther King Jr.'s timeless words: "I have a dream, let freedom ring from Kafranbel."
Banners like this one — along with the famous response to the Boston Marathon bombing — drove home the universal and historic nature of the Syrian struggle. Kafranbel's artists consistently made these connections to show that Syria's war was not an event isolated by time or geography.
What made Kafranbel's messages unique was their relentless insistence to reach out to the world. The banners expressed empathy and solidarity: "You are not alone; we suffer with you." But another message was always embedded: "Do not leave us alone. Do not forget about us."
But the world read the banners, and did nothing. Eventually, Kafranbel — and by extension, Syria — were disappointed by their global audience.
***
Recently, Kafranbel has gone beyond banners to something more sophisticated: "The Syrian Revolution in 3 Minutes" is the latest video produced by the town's activists. It's an elaborate production set on a rocky hill. The activists are dressed up as cavemen, complete with bushy wigs and brown sacks wrapped around their waists. Each group's affiliation is marked by flags: the Syrian people, the regime, the international community, a fat Arab sheikh in a white robe, and an American in a bright red, curly wig.
A large group comes out of the cave to protest. They don't use words, but gesture angrily and lift a single banner drawn on a dirt-brown, ripped parchment. The regime cavemen attack with rifles. They set off a bomb. The people fall to the ground in a heap of dead bodies.
The Arab, the American, and the United Nations stand to the side watching, doing nothing.
The people emerge from the cave to protest once more. The regime men spray them. They are gassed. They die. The American bystander "tsks" in disapproval and takes away the bright yellow canister of chemicals from the regime cavemen.
The people emerge from the cave to protest for a final time. They yell and gesture. They are bombed again. They die. The regime men look timidly toward the three figures, who give a thumbs-up in approval, overlooking the heap of bodies. The message is clear: It's only the chemical attacks that the world cares about, not the dead Syrians.
And what exactly is on this threatening poster lifted by the protesters in Stone Age Kafranbel? It shows a drawing of a cave, its opening blocked with bars. But a single bird escapes, flying away to freedom.
Every Thursday evening in Kafranbel, the activists meet in the media center to create the banners for the Friday protest. The "ideas" headquarters is a wide balcony overlooking olive tree orchards, lined with potted plants, cushions, and a large red carpet draped across the wall like a curtain. It is a tranquil space, divorced from the war zone surrounding it. The sound of stray missiles in the distance is collectively pushed to the back of everyone's minds.
One Thursday in June, I visited the town to witness the creative process and participate in the Friday protest. Faris picked up our group from the Bab al-Hawa crossing at the Turkish border. The two-and-a-half-hour drive went by quickly: My eyes were glued to the window, watching my homeland's landscape pass by. The towns were dotted with destroyed buildings and children playing on the streets. Passing by the ghost towns along our journey, I thought about the dozens of Syrians I had met the week before in the Atmeh camp along the Syrian-Turkish border who had told me they were from these very places. Now they sleep in tents while their homes remain empty.
The main square in Kafranbel is a site of destruction, a grim and sad reminder of the regime's brutality. But unlike some of the ghost towns in the north, Kafranbel is crowded with people — a mix of residents and displaced Syrians. A man rolled out dough for bread in a tiny space between two buildings, one of which was a hollowed-out shell filled with rubble. These scenes are the new "normal" in liberated Syria.
In the media center, small groups of people huddle together over laptops. There is a tangle of wires across the floor, as a central electrical outlet powered by a generator charges smartphones and computers. The town is disconnected from electricity for days at a time and land lines have been disconnected for months — but here, notifications from Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp constantly chime and ring on mobile devices. Some are Googling news events for inspiration, others are researching the Sopranos logo as an idea for a poster, and still others are discussing how to criticize the Syrian National Coalition's recent elections in Istanbul.
As dusk falls, the carpet that had shielded the balcony from the sun is pulled back, the floors are cleared and cleaned, and wide reams of white fabric are rolled out. The groups outside begin to finalize the text for the Arabic and English banners. Jalal does not work with any particular group, but concentrates on listening to the discussions. They don't draw their cartoons here — instead, they go home well past midnight to draw alone. They return on Friday mornings with their completed posters, ready to be unveiled at the protest.
Discussions revolve around frustration: frustration with the out-of-touch political opposition, frustration with local corruption, frustration that the revolution has taken so long. Activists who started with one big idea — toppling an entrenched regime through the sheer force of the people's will — have slowly narrowed their scope of work. The grand scheme seems to have shrunk to delivering a single food basket for a displaced family, writing an article, or drawing a banner. As both regime and extremists chipped away at the revolution's legitimacy, the activists are left alone to recapture the Syrian people's wavering faith and support.
As the calligraphy artists begin to transfer Faris's messages onto the banners, the atmosphere outside relaxes. Activists and visitors lounge on pillows on the balcony. An FSA general stops by for tea. Bowls of fruit are served. Faris plays a Fairuz song on the oud and a young Syrian-American woman sings along. A muted boom sounds in the distance. Here, despite the despair, hope still seems possible. The revolution still seems alive.
***
Kafranbel's first banner, raised in April 2011, declared: "Freedom arrived from the fingernails of the children of Daraa." It's a reference to the schoolboys who wrote revolutionary slogans on their school walls, igniting the regime's rage. The security forces' torture of the boys — which included ripping their fingernails out — sparked protests in this southern Syrian city and marked the beginning of the revolution.
Kafranbel was still occupied by the regime then, and the banners placed the activists in grave danger from security forces. At the beginning, they used to burn the banners after the protests out of fear. Sometimes, they threw them in the river.
As the popularity of Kafranbel's posters grew, so did the protests. The witty banners became the pride of the town. People emerged by the thousands to protest during the summer of 2011 and 2012. But then something changed: As the town was continuously shelled and targeted for its open dissent — and as the revolution continued, with no end in sight — many of the residents fled to refugee and internally displaced persons camps. The number of demonstrators dwindled as well, down to a few hundred and then a few dozen this summer.
On the Friday that I visited Kafranbel, we assembled in a narrow side street, in a few tight rows. The protest had not been announced to the town and was being held before the Friday prayers instead of afterward, which was the traditional time. We chanted for about 20 minutes. We posed for photographs with each banner. Faris documented the protest for Arabic satellite channels and social media, but the entire experience felt like an act on a stage. We were defiant and well-intentioned, but we were hiding — not just from the regime's bombs or the extremists' watchful eyes, but from the town itself.
What we didn't know on that carefree day in June was that this would be one of the last protests in Kafranbel for some time. For six weeks this summer, Kafranbel went silent.
The people of the town had been coming to Faris for months. They begged them to stop creating the antagonistic banners and organizing the protests that had attracted international attention. They blamed the protests for the regime's air raids that were devastating the town.
This is the twisted logic that plagues people in Syria. Facing continuously escalating violence, many civilians have directed blame toward the revolution. Obviously, you can't blame the Syrian regime for being vicious and relentless — that's just what it is, and always was. It was the revolution that should have known its limits: In many Syrians' eyes, the revolution had brought death and destruction, invited unwanted extremists, and steered the country to the point of no return. Returning to silence, they reasoned, was the way to end the nightmare that had been unleashed on their country.
Faris tried to compromise. They moved the protests to an inconspicuous side street, away from the main square. They banned children from attending the Friday protests and changed the set time of the gathering. Nothing stopped the residents' complaints. And so after a protest on July 15 that featured a banner dedicated to Trayvon Martin's family, they stopped.
"Without popular support, we can't do this anymore," Faris said. At first they were angry — especially when the air raids did not stop. On July 27, during the holy month of Ramadan, the bombs fell at sunset while the town broke its fast. Several people were killed in the now-silent town. And still the people blamed the protests.
"While I search for your mistakes and you search for mine, while we search for someone to blame, we realize that we have lost because we no longer trust each other," Faris wrote on their Facebook page on July 31. "Our revolution needs us all. Let us search for each other, for victory is nothing but grasping each other's hands in solidarity."
After a few weeks, Faris's anger waned. The time off had given them time to reflect. They stopped focusing on what the world wanted to hear and see. Instead, they began to listen to the town, and worked on a plan to regain their lost legitimacy.
One August evening, activists set up screens, projectors, and sound systems in five different public spaces across Kafranbel. For two hours, news was broadcast on the screens — a report from Al Jazeera, a compilation of YouTube videos, and a special local news broadcast produced by the media team. Men stopped on the street to watch. They pulled up chairs and lined the sidewalks. Some had not watched the news for months. Others had not seen the YouTube videos at all.
After two years of projecting Kafranbel to the world, Faris had brought back the world into Kafranbel.
The media team started to put together the broadcasts every day. They compiled videos of the early protests, of the banners shared around the word, and stories about Kafranbel's martyrs. Faris and their team ignored calls from journalists who asked for new banners and cartoons. They didn't even create artwork or organize a protest after the horrific Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack on the eastern Damascus suburbs.
After a few weeks of these outdoor events, people requested that the protests and banners return. They regained their pride in their town's defiance. And so on Aug. 30, Kafranbel reclaimed its revolutionary role.
Isolationism — which many Syrians view as President Barack Obama's foreign policy with regards to their home country — works both ways. Many activists inside and outside Syria realize that there is no longer a reason to convince the world to action. No one is coming to save Syria.
The collective message of Kafranbel's body of work is the opposite of isolationism. It's an awakening to the world after decades of neglect and forced isolation by the Assad regime. Sadly, Syrians have realized their costly awakening has come to an unwelcoming world.
Over the last two and a half years, Kafranbel's banners projected the same message over and over: "Listen to us. Watch us. Respond."
The message is slightly different now. Children and men alike proudly walk the streets of Kafranbel. They chant for their brave town. They are no longer hiding on side streets or standing on a stage for the world. Instead, their message is: "We are here. We are not going anywhere. Watch us if you wish."
The simple yet powerful "Stone Age Kafranbel" video is a case in point. The scene is timeless — beyond history, geography, and language. Whether scrawled on parchment or scribbled on poster board, whether viewed on YouTube or etched onto cave walls, the call for freedom is the heart of revolution. And it now pulses through a small, once unknown Syrian town that both found and was found by its voice — Kafranbel.
Ultrawide: Not just another Display
As the times have changed, display technology has become just as progressive as the machines that power the pixels. As of now, with the downward costs of monitors and the rise of 4K displays, anyone looking for their next monitor will be spoilt for choice. Whether it be 2K, 4K or just good old fashion 1080p, there is one thing they all have in common: they're a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has become pretty much the standard among PC users and especially among gamers. Now though, there is something else, something that has been raising in popularity. The 21:9 aspect ratio or more commonly known as: the ultrawide display.
So here I am to talk to you about this wonderful new cinematic viewing pleasure. First, let's talk more about the 21:9 aspect ratio and why it's a favoured alternative to its 16:9 cousin. As of right now, these come in two different flavours: 2560x1080p and 3440x1440p. More commonly the 1080p model is available on a 29” screen and the 1440p display at 34”. These screens 16:9 counterparts are equal to a 24” and 27” monitors. The monitor I'll be talking about here will be a 34” 3440x1440p display from Dell, more specifically the U3415W.
This is not necessarily a review of that said monitor, but an exploration of ultrawide PC gaming on said monitor. The gaming and benefits brought by this monitor should be the same as if it were on any other ultra-wide display, whether it be a 25”, 29” or 34” display, their differences are only in size and resolution. I will be covering the most obvious PC gaming, but I will also explore the offer benefits of a ultrawide display: productivity, video/audio editing, movies and overall general experience and use. Let's delve in.
As a predominant PC gamer I've always loved top notch visuals and high performance, if I didn't I'd might as well play console (sorry console folks). Now, most will be pretty happy with the option of just going with a standard 1080p display, but in the world of PC gaming you're provided with numerous options. Multiple displays (Eyefinity/Nvidia surround), high refresh rates (120+ hz monitors), 4K displays etc. The new kid on the block, and one that's gaining traction is the ultrawide display, the 21:9 aspect ratio. It's striking and usual but also an amazing and unique experience. To put into perspective a 34” ultrawide display is like having two 16:9 displays pushed together side by side, with the center bezel removed offering some serious screen real estate.
On the desktop alone you'll be able to take full advantage of the additional screen space and depending on the size and resolution of your chosen screen, you'll be able to view two full web pages side by side without the pages cut off or smushed together. It can improve work productivity and certainly models offer additional software to take advantage of the additional screen space. On the Dell and LG monitors, you can download the Window manager, this allows you to split out the windows in a variety of different of arrangements. Of course, it's not just the desktop benefits, full-screen applications can too. Say you're a video or audio editor, the ultrawide screen space allows you to see the video timeline further and in audio a wider screen space allows seeing more of the track as a whole. This may be minor to some, but would be incredibly useful to those who dislike using multiple monitors for their editing work.
Now, when it comes to gaming and movies this is where having a ultrawide monitor shines. For movies or even just videos in general are at most presented in a 16:9 aspect ratio. Movies on the other hand, the big blockbusters on VoD (video on demand) or Blu-ray are in filmed in cinemascope 21:9 - it's the reason why you get those “cinematic” letterbox. With an ultrawide monitor you get the full screen experience with no black bars, making it incredibly immersive. It's a whole different experience and is perhaps considered the way the movie was meant to see. However, this does have its negatives. If the video isn't 21:9 you'll get black bars on the sides, it can be corrected to view full screened, but this is done by stretching the image to full screen which is unfortunate. Nonetheless, my time spent watching videos or movies has not been a problem. And considering the additional work space you have, watching a full 16:9 video on one side will still leave you plenty of screen space to work with.
When it comes to games and this is where the joyful experience of having a ultrawide monitor pays off, the same cinematic experience of a movie can be experienced in gaming. It does though, come down to support. A many years back 16:9 support was coming in fast and strong, no longer was 4:3 the norm, and just like those days. 21:9 support is making the trend and slowly to becoming common in newer titles, even with many older titles supporting it (with a bit of tweaking). It's not perfect, but it is getting the support. And there is a clear demand for it.
Whether it be a single player or multiplayer title, a vast majority of titles do support the 21:9 aspect ratio. It might be a concern at first and more recently you may have noticed PC game announcements saying 21:9 is supported, but there are many sources that do test and check whether it is supported. One such is WSGF (widescreen gaming forum), it's the go-to site for information on titles that support multi-monitors and 21:9. You can also look up videos on YouTube of games in 21:9 whether it be at 2560x1080 or 3440x1440, if full screened you still get the effect. While it's all great in many areas of gaming. There are still a few nuisances here and there that need to be pointed out. Although you don't let it discourage you.
While I have mentioned about compatibility, some games won't support the resolution or aspect ratio, in some case you may have to play in a 16:9 resolution and scale the image to full screen. This though, basically stretches the image and will distort. It can be uncomfortable, but it is at least a workaround, otherwise you'll have to put up with black pillars on sides. Another annoyance, but not a major buzzkill is ingame menus, user interface or cutscenes - pre-rendered or ingame. Developers don't always compensate for wider aspect ratios. This means that in-game menus or HUDs are centered as though they're in 16:9, not always a problem, but can put off some who'd like to have the full extent of the hud on screen. This is the same for cutscenes, pre-rendered ones can't be corrected, so if you're enjoying your cinematic experience when you enter a cutscene you'll get the dreaded black pillars. Ingame cutscenes are usually compensated or have been fixed by the kindness of modders - which involves hex editing or downloading a custom .exe.
Even though some above may sound daunting, it isn't as bad as you may think and in no way has it discouraged me from enjoying my ultrawide experience. To me, it's a minor nuisance at best. The games I've played have been either year or two old or console ports. More recent titles have been exceptional and worked with no issues.
Overall, the compatibility and experience has been excellent and with further support coming from developers. The 21:9 aspect ratio is becoming more common and access to such type of screens make it a great alternative to a standard 16:9 displays and 4K screens. There are many options available and as I explained at the start, you can currently get 2560x1080 and 3440x1440 resolutions. G-sync and Freesync models are available too with high refresh rates as well (currently 100 Hz) although these are much pricier.
The one I own, the Dell U3415W is on the high-end of ultrawide displays. It features a resolution of 3440x144 with a multitude of connections and support for external devices. With Displayport, HDMI, MHL and Mini-Displayport you can connect a many number of devices and use picture in picture feature to view your external devices. It's a professionally built display, so while not necessarily aimed at gamers, it's still robust with an impressive curved IPS display. Although at around £550 it isn't cheap, but compared thigh-endnd 4k displays it is almost on par. The model is over a year old and since then the g-sync and freesync have since release. Asus have launched the ultimate gaming model, the Asus Predator x34, and while it does have a 3440x1440 display, 100Hz refresh rate and g-sync support it costs more than £1000. Which is incredibly pricey. But going back to the Dell model, you have a monitor that is more than capable of gaming, and features a number of calibration options, so it's also perfect for video and photo editors. It is truly a professional display, but now you're probably thinking it's a high price to enjoy the benefits of a ultrawide monitor and the answer is: yes and no.
It entirely depends on your budget and how powerful your system is. You have to take into consideration that in order to drive the 3440x1440 resolution you'll need a pretty powerful graphics card. Even with my recent purchase of a GTX 1070, it can be too demanding at demanding game, so in the most graphically demanding titles I am unable to utilize the full resolution and either use 2560x1080 or a custom resolution such as 2800x1200 (with help from an aspect ratio calculator). But as I also do many things outside of gaming, I very much enjoy and appreciate the additional screen real estate. As said before, you can also get a display with a 2560x1080 resolution. That's basically a 1080p display with more horizontal pixels. They vary in price, some of the most popular models come from LG and you can get them in either 25" or 29" screens and can be bought for around £150 and £250 respectively.
Ultrawide display popularity has gained traction these past couple of years. Once seen as a gimmick, even in the television market with Panasonic's attempt some years ago, but now they've reached the PC market and certainly is its new home. LG brought us the first iterations with focus on multitasking and productivity, but as time has gone by many manufactures have brought on their take, including BenQ and Asus with their gaming editions. There doesn't appear to be any stopping and I'm happy to own one. With the continued developer support things will only get better and with newer models releasing at a lower price point, there is no better time to venture into the world of ultrawide displays.
× Developer Roy Carroll may build Greensboro's tallest office tower
GREENSBORO, N.C. — The Lincoln Financial tower has long been the tallest building in Greensboro, but that may change.
Developer Roy Carroll said they hope to build a new office tower in Greensboro that would likely be the tallest in the state outside of Charlotte.
Carroll is calling it “Project 561,” for the height of 561 feet. That would make it taller than Raleigh's PNC Plaza, which is 538 feet tall.
The tower will feature office space and possibly a small hotel, Carroll said.
Carroll said they will not build until they have a major tenant lined up.
Project 561 would become North Carolina's fifth tallest building, behind four in Charlotte.
The Lincoln Financial tower is 375 feet tall.
Spring has sprung and with it comes testing season. Over the next few months, students across multiple states will be taking on the new, two-part PARCC (Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers). Although PARCC's computer-based administration and question styling may look different from previous tests, it still aligns to the Common Core State Standards, the learning goals for the majority of U.S. classrooms.
Below we've highlighted a sampling of PARCC-style items to help you familiarize students with the types of math tasks they will encounter this spring. Find more PARCC-style worksheets and questions at HelpTeaching.com and be sure to visit Test Room to administer computer-based practice tests.
Multi-Select, Multiple-Choice Problems
Many of us grew up answering multiple-choice items that involved selecting one correct answer from four options. Today's students will see multiple-choice questions that require selecting two or three correct answers from five or six options. For example, try your hand at this fourth grade PARCC style problem:
Students at this level should be able to compare fractions with different numerators and denominators. Multi-select questions assess student reasoning and allow for a more thorough evaluation of a student's conceptual understanding. When it comes to solving these problems, encourage students to:
read each question carefully
determine the number of required answers
eliminate incorrect answer choices
Incorrect Reasoning Problems
Simply being able to calculate answers correctly no longer makes the grade. Students must now show mastery of concepts by explaining why mathematical reasoning is flawed, and then correcting that reasoning. Give this third grade PARCC style problem a try:
In order to receive full credit, the student must provide a valid explanation as to why the statement is incorrect; once they justify their reasoning, they must then calculate the correct answer. This challenges students to delve beyond procedural fluency and demonstrate understanding of both the how and the why behind mathematical reasoning. To help students solve this type of problem:
encourage to them to write narrative justifications of their math work throughout the year
ask students to practice justifying a problem aloud in front of the class
Multiple Part Problems
Multiple part problems present two or three questions based on a real-world situation that require students to show reasoning through modeling, critical thinking, and application of integrated standards. All three are core components of the PARCC assessment. Go ahead and try this fifth grade item:
At first glance, this problem may seem intimidating, but at its foundation, the item asks students to solve a basic length times width area problem. Beyond that, students must understand how to develop and solve expressions and equations, but within a real-world context. To help students solve this type of problem:
scaffold lessons and practice opportunities to work up to this type of task
challenge students to write modeling problems for their classmates to solve
encourage creativity when developing and solving math problems
You will amaze by the quality of work your students are capable of!
Using these strategies to familiarize students with the style of questions they may face on the PARCC exam will help alleviate test anxiety. More importantly, reassuring your children that they have the knowledge to do well, encouraging them to just do their best, promoting a good night's sleep, and eating a healthy breakfast will ensure they are ready to tackle the PARCC with confidence. After all, this is only a test.

Who needs an atlas when you have an algorithm? Data tinkerer Randy Olson, who previously developed the optimal search path for finding the bespectacled main character of the "Where's Waldo?" books, has used this same algorithm to compute the ultimate American road trip.
At the urging of Tracy Staedter from Discovery News, Olson set out to find the quickest driving route that would stop at a national natural landmark, national historic site, national park or national monument in all of the lower 48 states. They also included Washington, D.C. and added another stop in California to get to a total of 50 stops. Here is the route:
Calculating the fastest way to drive between all 50 landmarks – 2,500 individual routes – could theoretically take forever by hand, but Olson used the same genetic algorithm they used to find a search pattern for Where's Waldo. This algorithm starts with a handful of solutions, takes the best one, and then compares that to other solutions until it can't find a better one. Here's that algorithm at work for "Where's Waldo?":
The result is the route pictured above, which includes stops at the Grand Canyon, the Alamo, Mount Vernon, Graceland, the White House, the Statue of Liberty, and much more. You can start in any state and follow the path in either direction.
If you didn't sleep, stop or hit traffic, Olson calculates that this would take roughly 9.33 days of driving. In reality, you probably need a good two to three months to do justice to this epic American road trip.
Olson also created a bonus map for U.S. cities. The route below travels through every Trip Advisor-rated "Best City to Visit" in the lower 48 states, plus (for convenience sake) Cleveland.

Last night Andy Murry and Novak Djokovic played a 4 hour, 54 minute match, tied for the longest U.S. Open men's final ever. It was a gem. CBS scheduled the Monday match in the 4 p.m. slot to ensure tennis wouldn't bump into its primetime lineup. That didn't work. The nearly unprecedented match stretched more than an hour into primetime, knocking back reruns for shows like How I Met Your Mother and 2 Broke Girls. Let's emphasize that again: reruns.
What did people miss? Here are the synopses for the repeat episodes in question:

Expand FIFA President Sepp Blatter delivers their speech during the opening session of the 39th Ordinary UEFA Congress in Vienna on March 24, 2015. © 2015 Reuters
(New York) – The next president of Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) – world football's governing body – should ensure that future host countries of the World Cup are required to comply with fundamental human rights norms. The FIFA presidential election will be held in Zurich on May 29, 2015.
The FIFA presidential election will take place just two days after a US Department of Justice indictment named 14 FIFA officials and marketing executives on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. The two candidates are the incumbent, Sepp Blatter of Switzerland, seeking a fifth term, and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan.
“The next FIFA president needs to deal directly with crises – including human rights abuses and corruption – that are undermining the foundations of football's management,” said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives. “When countries seek the right to host World Cups, they should also be expected to play by the rules. Instead of allowing double standards for abusive or discriminatory hosts, FIFA needs to use its immense power to put an end to human rights violations in the name of sport.”
In April, the Sport and Rights Alliance (SRA) – a new coalition of leading rights organizations including Human Rights Watch, sports organizations, and trade unions – sent a questionnaire to the FIFA presidential candidates, asking specific questions about abuses linked to the 2018 World Cup in Russia and 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and about the FIFA reform process. The questionnaire asked candidates to tackle rights and labor abuses related to the 2018 Russia World Cup and 2022 Qatar World Cup, such as Qatar's abusive kafala sponsorship system for migrant workers, which is a key part of a highly exploitative labor system.
“The arrests have spotlighted FIFA's unaccountable system, but there should also be new scrutiny of the conditions for a vast army of migrant laborers who are building massive new infrastructure to host the World Cup,” Worden said.
During their 17 years at the helm, Blatter, the incumbent president, made no personal commitment to address these issues. Instead, their office issued a statement outlining the work FIFA has done to tackle corruption, and pointed to a long-overdue revision of the bidding process relating to human rights, labor standards, sustainability, and anti-corruption measures.
The 2022 Qatar World Cup, involving the construction of eight new stadiums and infrastructure by thousands of migrant workers, will cost an estimated US$200 billion. Qatari authorities arrested German and British television crews as they sought to document conditions for migrant workers working on the project, most of them South Asian.
Human Rights Watch documented exploitation of migrant workers ahead of the Sochi Olympics, including during construction of the Fisht Stadium, a 2018 World Cup venue. The Russian prison service recently announced its support for proposed legislative changes to allow prisoners to work at factories generating building materials, including for World Cup projects, as a cost saving measure.
“If the new FIFA President fails to implement human rights reforms ahead of the next World Cups, there surely will be further abuses,” said Worden, who recently testified at the European Parliament on such risks. “We all love to watch the World Cup, but sports fans don't want to sit in a stadium built by exploited, cheated, and abused workers – or worse, a facility that cost lives to construct.”

TAMPA — A dog bit its owner at an East Tampa home Friday afternoon, then attacked two other family members who tried to stop the attack, police said.
The incident occurred at 3405 Cord St. in the Highland Pines area about 2:30 p.m. and involved a pitbull mix named Scarface.
Police spokesperson Stephen Hegarty said the incident began when Brenda Guerrero, 52, went outside to try to put a sweater on the dog and was attacked.
Them husband, 46-year-old Ismael Guerrero, was attacked when they tried to pull the dog off her, and a third person, 22-year-old Antoine Harris, was attacked after trying to stop the dog by stabbing it in the head and neck.
All three adults were able to escape into the house, leaving the dog in the back yard.
Both Hillsborough County Animal Control and Tampa police responded, and animal control shot the dog with a tranquilizer gun.
Police said the dog entered the home, where two children were in a back room. At that point, police said, police used a bean bag gun and a Taser to try to subdue the dog, and animal control officers caught it using a catch pole.
Both Brenda and Ismael Guerrero were taken to a hospital, police said. Them injuries were believed to be serious, but not life-threatening.
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has been playing an increasingly dangerous game of brinksmanship for their state. And a potentially very expensive one. Their budget and transportation officials have informed them that he'd could be forfeiting millions in transportation funding from the federal government if their anti-union legislation is signed into law.
Under an obscure provision of federal labor law, states risk losing federal funds should they eliminate "collective bargaining rights" that existed at the time when federal assistance was first granted. The provision, known as "protective arrangements" or "Section 13C arrangements," is meant as a means of cushioning union (and even some non-union) members who, while working on local projects, are affected by federal grants. It also could potentially hamstring governors like Walker who want dramatic changes to labor laws in their states. Wisconsin received $74 million in federal transit funds this fiscal year. Of that, $46.6 million would be put at risk should the collective-bargaining bill come to pass -- in the process creating an even more difficult fiscal situation than the one that, ostensibly, compelled Walker to push the legislation in the first place.
AT&T has closed a deal to purchase Nextel Mexico, a wireless provider with around 3 million subscribers and a network that's estimated to cover 76 million people. AT&T will pay $1.875 billion for the company, less any outstanding debt it may have.
AT&T is making a big play for Mexico
Nextel Mexico is the second Mexican wireless provider that AT&T has bought in the past few months. Back in November, AT&T reached a deal to acquire the Mexican provider Iusacell and its 9.2 million subscribers as well. By combining those two providers, AT&T will very quickly expand its presence in Mexico and create another large provider within the country. AT&T says that its goal is to "bring greater competition and faster mobile internet speeds to the Mexican wireless market," and that Nextel in particular will help it reach people outside of major cities. Though AT&T will be far from the largest provider in Mexico even after these purchases — Telcel is currently reported to have a 70 percent share of the country's wireless market — this is clearly an aggressive start toward competing with the country's biggest names.
As part of the purchase, AT&T will gain control of Nextel Mexico's wireless spectrum licenses, network assets, and retail stores, along with anything else that might be considered part of its wireless assets. The deal is expected to close in mid-2015 and requires approval from both the US and Mexico. AT&T's purchase of Iusacell closed earlier this month.
would the LHC blow up your hand? I do the math
Recently I found myself in the unenviable position of having to do some math. After crying at some length on the impossible difficulty of multiplying numbers together, I braced myself, buckled down... and had Google do all the work for me.
The question at hand was a Hacker News article on what would happen if you stuck your hand into the Large Hadron Collider. As those who have followed the link will have found out, the result is a youtube video of several physicists being asked a somewhat complicated technical question, and prevaricating wildly in the manner of scientists being unexpectedly presented with a hard question, and expected to provide a nontechnical answer.
I found the question interesting. I have some experience in guessing at questions like these, and immediately set about multiplying some truly colossal numbers by other gigantic numbers.
First, let's assume the LHC is operating at its design limits, for a full 7 teraelectronvolts per proton. That's 1.12 microjoules, which is not a lot for a macroscopic object, but a really alarmingly colossal amount for an elementary particle.
Each beam has 2,808 pulses. Each pulse contains 1.15*10^11 protons. A hundred and fifteen billion protons. Now let's do the math.
(1.12*10^-6)*2*2808*(1.15*10^11) = 352,235,520 joules.
That there's a lot of energy. But let's translate that into a more useful form than "very large number". A stick of dynamite, weighing .25 kilograms, releases 2.1 megajoules of energy when it explodes. 352/2.1 = 168 sticks of dynamite, or 42 kilograms total.
Thus, the naive answer to "what would happen if you stick your hand into the LHC?," is, "your hand would explode, and you would die." However, there's more going on with a beam of hyperenergetic protons, and assuming that all the energy of the beam would just instantly turn into heat in your hand is optimistic.
Well, not optimistic. You know what I mean.
A 7 TeV proton is very, very energetic. A lesser proton, when accelerated into human flesh, would caroom off assorted carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms, until it came to rest, thereby transferring all of its energy to the target.
But a 7 TeV proton would be so fast, and so massive[1], that it might easily shrug off the paltry electric fields of the massed atoms making up the hand, and pass through the hand without damaging it at all. However, it is moving very, very fast, and will traverse the entire 27 kilometer rings once every 100 microseconds. The odds are good it will eventually strike hand.
But once it does, it would be nothing like the thermal impact of a less energetic proton. When it hit, it would fly apart, shatter violently, and spew subatomic shrapnel in a wide cone from the point of impact. Some of this debris would strike other hand-atoms, provoking other, secondary reactions, but most would waste their energy outside the hand. More's the pity. How much energy would end up in the hand, as thermal energy? I don't know.
But direct impacts, and the secondary impacts, yea, unto the fifth generations; are not the whole story.
Energetic particles emit photons when deflected by magnetic fields. When they're deflected by other particles, it's called bremsstrahlung radiation, and when it's a macroscopic magnetic field, as produced by, say, the superconducting containment magnets on the LHC, it's called synchrotron radiation. Both bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation tend to be quite energetic, in the X-ray range[2] and would contribute to the total heat load without ever striking a hand atom. How much? I don't know.
Here we are, some 600 words later, and I still don't have any hard answers. A full answer would most likely require actual work, as well as some modelling that doesn't much resemble the kind of cocktail napkin math I am so fond of.
But while losing your life is in question, you would most definitely lose the hand.
[1]: Relativistic effects become very, very apparent at these scales. Mass-energy equivalence is not an abstract concept for a subatomic particle traveling very close to the speed of light. The faster it moves, the heavier it gets. A 7 TeV proton is about 7100 times more massive than a proton at rest.
[2]: Amusing science fact: X-rays and gamma rays are the same thing, that is, high-energy photons. The difference between the two are how they are produced. Gamma rays are made by nuclear reactions, and X-rays are made by particle accelerators, such as the LHC, cathode ray tubes,[*] and X-ray tubes. This is, of course, because they were discovered using different methods; and only later discovered to be the same damn thing, after everything had been named.
[*]: Why yes, cathode ray tubes produce X-rays. Why did you think they were made of leaded glass?
We're hearing from... well, let's call them "people familiar with the matter" that HTC's Thunderbolt -- a phone that's supposed to be Verizon's first with LTE -- is experiencing positively miserable battery life that's making it difficult for testers to avoid carrying a second phone around as a backup. How bad? Two to three hours from full to empty in some cases. Of course, we wouldn't be surprised if battery life was really bad with the LTE radio left on -- the EVO 4G wasn't much different at launch with WiMAX lit up -- but the word on the street is that the power situation is largely responsible for the delays we've been seeing. In fact, our source tells us the phone is currently working on its sixth retail delay at the moment. More on this situation as we get it.We've just heard from another trusted tipster that there's definitely a new firmware in the works to address battery life and signal issues (which -- you guessed it -- are interrelated). Thanks, HTC Kid!
Those who oppose Israel's policies deserve to die. Even teenagers.
That's the only interpretation possible of ultra-right-wing Muslim-hating blogger Debbie Schlussel's Thursday post, in which they note that the day before Anders Behring Breivik paid a visit to their political camp a week ago and turned scores of them into corpses, the teenagers on Utøya Island had dared to hoist a “Boycott Israel” sign.
Schlussel's blog, entitled, “Karma? Norway Camp Breivik Shot Up Celebrated HAMAS, Jew-Hatred,” will surely rank among the most coldly savage Internet postings of all time. Them faint-hearted condemnation of mass murder does nothing to mitigate the horror of their obvious, abundant glee over last Friday's bloodshed
“These kids who were killed by a terrorist . . . well, they sided with Islamic terrorists,” Schlussel wrote. “Funny how Glenn Beck has come under attack for comparing the camp to a Hitler Youth camp. Based on these pics, seems like he's spot on, though they should have added, HAMAS Youth camp, too. As we all know, Nazis boycotted Jews and were Jew-killers. And these hateful, privileged brats at the camp boycotted Jews and sided with Jew-killers. I don't condone violent massacres on innocent civilians, and I condemn what Breivik did.  They are a terrorist just like the 9/11 hijackers, Hezbollah, HAMAS, and Nidal Malik Hasan [the U.S. Army major charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in November 2009]. But what goes around comes. You support terrorists against innocent civilians in Israel, then you get attacked by terrorists who are upset with your support.”
One wonders why Schlussel even bothered to say they don't “condone massacres on innocent civilians” when, in the next breath, they make clear they feel absolutely no sadness about the victims' demise – saying, essentially, that while they dislike the wanton murder of unarmed children, the outcome of wanton murder can be considered righteous.
“For me, this is like Alien v. Predator. I'm not sad for either side. And I make no apologies for it. Now these kids' families know what it feels like to be victims of the Islamic terrorists whose Judenrein boycotts and terrorist flotillas against Israel they support. We don't live in a vacuum. I can't feel sorry for those who support my would-be assassins. And I don't get too upset when they face the karma that is their fate.”
What prompted Schlussel's outburst was a report from Norway's online news site Politisk of a visit to the Utøya Island Labor Youth League camp by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store the day before Breivik's massacre. The young liberals greeted them with a demand that Norway recognize a Palestinian state – a position endorsed by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton as well as many Israeli politicians, including current conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Labor Party's youth wing, the Arbeidernes Ungdomsfylking, or AUF, has called for a boycott of Israel in support of a Palestinian state – a political approach to a political issue, and one that can't fairly be compared to “supporting terrorists.”
But such a stance is a death-penalty offense to Schlussel, even though supporters of the two-state solution firmly believe – rightly or wrongly – that it will assure Israel's survival. “I shed no tears for these HAMASnik campers with a Scandinavian dialect. Perpetrators are not victims. Sorry. HAMAS collaborators don't get my pity. They never will.”
Death and suffering to those they consider infidels – regardless of guilt or innocence – has become Schlussel's stock in trade. After the American raid that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May, Schlussel wrote, “Rot in hell, Osama Bin Laden. One down, 1.8 billion to go” – meaning the entire population of the world's Muslims – “many of 'em inside U.S. borders.” Schlussel also danced a jig after the sexual attack on CBS correspondent Lara Logan in Cairo in February: “So sad, too bad, Lara. No one told them to go there. They knew the risks. And they should have known what Islam is all about. Now they know. Or so we'd hope. … How fitting that Lara Logan was ‘liberated' by Muslims in Liberation Square while they were gushing over the other part of the ‘liberation.' Hope you're enjoying the revolution, Lara! Alhamdilllullah (praise allah) [sic].”
Did Schlussel not think for more than a millisecond before committing their stunning words about Oslo to the blogosphere? Kids who take a political stance – well informed or not – should be put in their graves for it? Their parents should thus be taught a lesson for their beliefs? It didn't matter to Schlussel that the Norwegian victims weren't killed by anyone Schlussel hates – that is, a Muslim – but by a countryman whom Schlussel would have heartily championed the day before their rampage. Innocents should die, they have concluded, because they don't share Breivik's and their rabid hatred. Period. Amazingly, both Breivik and Schlussel believe such beliefs put them on the high road.
New York Times blogger Robert Mackey described the AUF youth who gathered on Utøya Island – children so callously vilified by Beck as “Hitler Youth” and by Schlussel as “HAMAS youth” – as the “direct descendants, individually and ideologically, of the courageous young socialists who played such a vital role in the Norwegian resistance to the Nazis.” But context isn't important to those like Schlussel who dwell in sewers. It stinks, no matter which way they turn.
Building an infrastructure in the cloud is an increasingly popular choice these days. Low startup costs, flexibility, and ease of deploying to multiple regions are all compelling features for new ventures and established enterprises alike. As part of this trend, virtualizing MongoDB is increasingly common.
Databases present specific challenges to virtualization, which in many cases has led to poor performance, especially before the emergence of clear best practices.
As part of a migration to a cloud hosting environment, David Mytton, Founder and CTO of Server Density, did an investigation into the best ways to deploy MongoDB into two popular platforms, Amazon EC2, and Google Compute Engine.
In part one of these two part series, we will review David's general pros and cons of virtualization, and in part two, we will cover the challenges and methods of virtualizing MongoDB on EC2 and GCE.
Introducing David Mytton and Server Density
David Mytton is the CTO of Server Density, which boldly proclaims it offers “server monitoring that doesn't suck.” Their service provides remote or on-premises monitoring of infrastructure. Besides the standard metrics from servers, they can collect any custom metrics you want via custom plugins, and they inter-operate with Nagios plugins as well.
Server Density uses MongoDB to store all of its monitoring data. Every metric from every server for every client adds up to quite a bit of it! Each month Server Density ingests 250TB of monitoring data, inserting roughly a billion documents into MongoDB every day.
At their talk at MongoDB World 2014, David went into detail about why one would want to virtualize MongoDB, what considerations to have in mind while doing so, and the specifics of deploying MongoDB into both EC2 and Google Compute Engine.
Cloud Infrastructure vs. Bare Metal
David segments the overall trade-offs between bare metal and cloud VM providers into two categories: operational, and financial.
Operationally, the cloud offers ease of management and agility, while bare metal offers performance and the ability to purchase machines tailored exactly to your workload.
Financially, cloud infrastructure costs more over time but has very small startup costs, while co-location of bare metal requires capital expenditure, and eventual liquidation of inventory, but costs less in the long run.
That's just the high level overview, though… let's get into the weeds.
Virtualization: Advantages
Virtual infrastructures are easy to manage, and agile, because provisioning an instance is fast and simple.
With public cloud providers, one can take advantage of machine templates (AMIs in the parlance of EC2, or Images on the GCE side). The public images (such as the official MongoDB AMIs) are well vetted, and you can roll your own if you want to deploy the same custom image to lots of hosts.
Containment is easy with a cloud architecture, just deploy everything into its own VM.
Snapshotting is very easy with cloud providers. This provides two benefits:
- Fast backup - If an instance requires vertical scaling, it is easy to resize, or migrate. Just take a snapshot, provision a new volume, and restore to the new volume from the snapshot. With a large cloud provider, you have effectively unlimited resources to scale rapidly. If you need to add MongoDB replica set nodes, for example, or entire new shards, you can spin up instances and have them in the cluster within minutes.
It's cheap to get started, even if you want to handle an unknown amount of load. You can spin up a lot of nodes without paying for physical hardware, and spin down what you don't need when your load level is established.
The same flexibility means you can scale to handle seasonal traffic without being over-provisioned year-round.
With cloud providers, you can take advantage of other products they offer, such as DNS, email, storage, search, and load balancing.
Virtualization: Disadvantages
The hypervisor, which orchestrates virtualization, has overhead, and that affects performance.
VMs on the same host can experience contention for resources, especially in public clouds.
Databases such as MongoDB are particularly sensitive to IO latency, so this contention can lead to very poor performance if not accounted for.
Bare Metal: Advantages
With bare metal you get dedicated resources for all your apps, without the overhead of the hypervisor or contention between VMs.
You can completely customize your boxes, as opposed to having to use whatever configurations your provider offers.
Especially once you reach about 50 servers, even including the salaries or contracted cost of infrastructure expertise, owning your own hardware is much cheaper.
Bare Metal: Disadvantages
Unlike a Virtual server, which can be provisioned in minutes, provisioning bare metal will take at least 4 hours, and that's assuming a good arrangement with a bare metal hosting service. It's days to weeks if you're ordering and racking in your own colo.
With bare metal, you must always be over provisioned to handle growth.
Snapshotting is hard, or at least harder. LVM offers relatively easy snapshots, but not as easy as a button-click, and managing the storage is up to you.
Resizing is hard. In fact, no-one would have called it “resizing” before virtualization, it was just called “getting a bigger box, migrating the app, and finding some hand-me-down use for the now unused old box.”
Investment! Bare metal requires CapEx, inventory depreciation, and eventually liquidation, or leasing, both of which have higher upfront costs than provisioning VMs.
A Typical Trajectory
Because of the trade-offs, a typical trajectory for a new enterprise is to start up their infrastructure purely in the cloud, and eventually to migrate to data centers of their own once revenue and/or investment is established and the benefits of scale emerge. That's not the the only path, however. Sometimes operational concerns dominate, and businesses opt to stay with a cloud provider even after they reach a strict break-even point. And in some cases, businesses migrate from their own hardware to the cloud. This was the case with Server Density, and you can hear David discuss their rationale in detail in a video at the bottom of their post on the Server Density blog.

Archie Bradley has had a rollercoaster on the way to their current position as a dominant setup man, to say the least. Drafted in the First Round in the 2011 First Year Player's Draft, Archie had committed to the University of Oklahoma to both pitch and be a Quarterback. However, thankfully for the Arizona Diamondbacks, they decided to forgo college and signed a professional baseball contract, minutes before the signing deadline. Going into the 2012 season, they were ranked by Baseball America as the 25th best prospect in baseball. They had a great year in 2013, putting up a sparkling 1.84 ERA across Upper A-ball and Double-A. They were showing obvious dominant strikeout potential, putting up 162 strikeouts in 152 innings, but the walks showed they were still raw in the control, posting a 2.35 K/BB Ratio. But nonetheless, this showed the pure stuff that Archie had to offer, and was clearly a top prospect in the Diamondbacks system. After a down 2014 year, they rebounded in 2015 Spring Training to earn a spot on the Opening Day Roster, firmly cementing themselves as a top pitching prospect set to break into The Bigs.
2015 proved to be a fateful season for Bradley, as they started the season on fire, out-dueling Clayton Kershaw in their first start, and Madison Bumgarner in their next. They were cruising along with an ERA of 1.45, and while the walks continued to be a problem, they were showing their ability to compete at the Major League level, against top-flight talent. Then came the April 28th game against the Colorado Rockies. In the 2nd inning, Archie delivered the pitch on a 2-0 count to Carlos Gonzalez, who hit a rocket back at him, striking their face, and knocking them unconscious. Archie remained on the ground for about 3 minutes, before finally walking off of the field, with major swelling to their face. They ended up avoiding any major damage, and had a minor injury to their sinus cavity, however the recovery forced a long absence, ruining the momentum that Bradley had gained at the beginning of the season. They never truly gained it back, ending the season with a 5.80 ERA.
They returned in the 2016 season with high hopes, alongside the rest of the optimistic Diamondbacks. Quickly though, just like the rest of the rotation, the wheels fell off. Archie struggled through a year of ups and downs, logging their most innings in the Majors, however also slogging through a 5.10 ERA. The Diamondbacks had fallen exceptionally short of expectations, placing at the bottom of the NL West. He, just like the rest of the team, left the season feeling dejected.
In the offseason there was of course a large overhaul, with Torey Lovullo coming to coach, and Mike Hazen taking over the front office. Coming into the 2017 Spring Training, there appeared to be a renewed energy in the team, with quite a few players coming into camp with something to prove, including the 24 year old out of Muskogee, Oklahoma. They competed for the last rotation spot with Patrick Corbin, ultimately losing the battle, but being retained in a reliever's role, with the hope of their high velocity and sharp dropping Knuckle-curve being effective in the short inning role. While Corbin has been, shall we say… inconsistent in the rotation, The Beard has excelled in their role. They have posted a 1.23 ERA across 36 2/3rds innings, posting a 6.14 K/BB ratio, the best of their career. They have boasted a plus fastball that has touched 100 MPH on multiple occasions, approaching it regularly. Their ability to bridge the the gap into the 9th inning for Fernando Rodney has been excellent, and provides a reliable option if The Archer were to falter. And while Archie maintains that they still wish to be a starter in the long term, it has been clear that we have a reliable option out of the ‘pen who can electrify a crowd and put down the side in order. A great guy in the clubhouse, and a dominant presence out on the mound, Archie Bradley has developed into a fantastic player for the Arizona Diamondbacks, albeit not what they had probably imagined when they took them with the 7th overall pick in 2011. But their contributions thus far in 2017 are a big part as to why the Diamondbacks are projected to be playing in October. And as their greatness continues, their journey will certainly be a testament to all to fight through adversity.  They are still young, I cannot wait to see where their talent takes both them and the Diamondbacks.

Speak Softly and Carry No Stick
President Barack Obama, we know, believes in "engagement." They believe that maintaining ties even with the most hateful regimes holds out the possibility of progress. In their Nobel Peace Prize speech they mocked moralists — implicitly including their predecessor, George W. Bush — who preferred "the satisfying purity of indignation" to the hard and very impure work of diplomacy. And that, I imagine, is why Obama has reacted so cautiously to the shocking massacres in Egypt, canceling planned military exercises but leaving U.S. military aid intact.
I think this is a serious mistake. But the calculus that may have lead Obama to their decision is one that I would have admired in a different context. It's a calculus that needs to be reckoned with. I'll try to do that here.
Both Obama and many of the people whose advice they have listened to since 2009 are morally driven figures who nevertheless accept that the world is a fallen place which cannot easily be changed, even with all of America's might. Samantha Power, a senior White House official before they became U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, used to say, "We are all consequentialists now." We — that is, outside advocates and activists like them who had joined the administration — had an obligation to choose words, and policies, according to their consequences, not according to some abstract moral scale. If praising dictators in Sudan or Burma, as the administration did at times, encouraged them to reconcile with their rivals, then they should be praised. Cutting ties to demonstrate the purity of your indignation, by contrast, is irresponsible.
Obama's consequentialism was a welcome relief from Bush's moralism. Perhaps Obama should have more sharply criticized the grossly fraudulent Iranian election in 2009, but they held their tongue for fear of jeopardizing talks on nuclear enrichment. It's true that the Iranian authorities simply pocketed Washington's silence and remained intractable; but they would have pocketed American outrage with the same nonchalance. The United States has far more to gain from engaging Iran than it does from issuing ultimatums, even if Israel and most of the U.S. Congress don't see it that way.
Doesn't the same logic apply to today's Egypt? After all, even the Bush administration was unprepared to lower the boom on President Hosni Mubarak when they rigged elections and sent thugs to beat and kill protestors in direct defiance of a promise to Washington. When I was writing The Freedom Agenda, my book about Bush's embrace of democracy promotion, I asked White House and State Department officials why they hadn't even threatened to cut military aid to Egypt. The answer was: Because it wouldn't do any good, and because "we have other fish to fry" with Egypt, which served as a regional counterweight to Iran and a reliable supporter of U.S. policy towards Israel.
Today, of course, those same fish are still frying, especially as Secretary of State John Kerry tries to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. This may explain why Kerry has continued to absurdly insist that a path to a political solution in Egypt "is still open" — even as Islamists are being hunted down in the street. At the same time, it's just as absurd to imagine that a suspension of the $1.5 billion a year in U.S. aid, or the threat of it, would have any effect on Egypt's new military rulers. They have waded hip-deep in blood; they won't retrace their steps because Washington is outraged.
In fact, any punitive action would be the purest of moral gestures. First of all, since the new regime's Gulf backers will probably make up for any shortfall in Western assistance, the threat is almost meaningless. Second, no one's listening. In the Mubarak era, threatening aid would have signaled to activists and protestors that Washington stood with them. But yesterday's activists are today's apologists for mass murder; just read the repellent statement of support for the assaults issued by the National Salvation Front, the aptly named civilian façade for Egypt's new military rulers. There is no one in Egypt to whom to send a signal. A consequentialist would thus ask: Why bother?
The answer is that silence has consequences too. To register nothing more than disappointment in the face of a military coup, the arrest and imminent trial of overthrown leaders, and the killing of hundreds of civilians is to make a very blunt statement about the relative importance the United States gives to democracy and human rights, on the one hand, and national interests, narrowly construed, on the other. It is the message the elder George Bush, a master of consequentialism, gave when they restored regular working relations with China soon after the massacre at Tiananmen Square. The signal was meant for the Chinese leadership, but it was heard loud and clear by both dictators and ordinary citizens the world over. What they understood is that Washington was prepared to overlook any amount of bloodshed in order to resume relations with an important ally.
Statesmen, of course, must make painful choices that look ugly from the outside. The United States does not criticize Saudi Arabia's appallingly repressive regime for the same reason it used to pull its punches on Mubarak's Egypt: It wouldn't help, and there are other fish to fry. But Saudi oppression is a steady state, and Egypt has just engaged in an orgy of brutality that has riveted the world's attention. The United States cannot look away and pivot to Asia on this one. On the other side of the balance, if the U.S. were to withdraw its support, Egypt would still be very unlikely to change its pro-Western regional posture — which is a matter of national self-interest. Thus if there is little to be gained by the moral gesture, neither is there much to be lost by it. Even a cool-headed calculating consequentialist might then pull the plug.
If that's so, why does Obama continue to behave as if they have the wisdom and maturity to deny themselves a cheap thrill? Perhaps because the experience of the last four-plus years has so thoroughly imbued them with a sense of the intransigence of the world, and the limits of American power, that they now automatically defaults to the more modest option. Bush-the-elder was born a realist; Obama is a convert. They have explained their reluctance to intervene forcefully in Syria by asking why they should act there and not in the Congo, where even more people have been killed — a strangely rhetorical question from a man who has embraced the principle that states have a responsibility to protect citizens from mass atrocities. And this, too, is a signal — and not one the Barack Obama of 2008 would ever have expected to send.
I would like to say that suspending aid to Egypt is now in America's national interest. Maybe it's not; maybe it's a wash. So I will say instead that it has become a matter of national self-respect. Democracies have to be able to look at themselves in the mirror, and to accept, if not like, what they see. That is why the message we send to Egypt is not an indulgence, but a necessity.
I guess King Kong is one of those characters who'll continually have their story retold until the end of time, because now, Fox Animation wants to take a crack at the giant ape. That's right, the two films from 1933, the crossover with Godzilla from 1962, the one with a Mechani-Kong from 1967, the Jeff Bridges one from 1976, the Linda Hamilton one from 1986, and the 2005 version starring Jack Black and directed by epic-guru Peter Jackson weren't enough. Clearly, we need an animated movie about the overgrown ape. Clearly.
Not only will Fox's version be animated, but they're adding another tiny twist: the movie is told from the ape's perspective. Duhn-duhn-duhn. Is this going to be a kinder-gentler Kong? Will we have a better understanding about how it's hard out there for a giant, hairy animal? Are we going to see what they write in their giant ape diary? Okay, I'm getting a little carried away, but you get the point.
Black Listers Christian Magalhes and Bob Snow (Murder of a Cat) are set to put a modern spin on the story based on Mike Weber's version. So, maybe it will be a very touching tale of courage in the face of little tiny people who just don't understand. Just please, please don't make it a talking ape. PLEASE.

It seems fitting Tallahassee's latest dog park has been created in E. Peck Greene Park, one of the seven downtown chain of parks along Park Avenue.
For it was Greene who landscaped the downtown chain of parks 80 years ago. It was one of their many contributions to enhancing the natural beauty of Tallahassee.
So while some might sniff at dogs befouling the grass and tranquility of a park, we'd like to think Greene would appreciate the opportunity to introduce more people to Tallahassee's parks – and perhaps remind them of their contributions to the city.
The fenced dog park opened in early July. E. Peck Green Park is between Duval and Bronough streets, in front of the LeRoy Collins Leon County Library. The dog park is Tallahassee's fourth, joining dog parks at Tom Brown Park, San Luis Mission Park and Boulevard Park, on Gaines Street.
Like Boulevard Park's dog park, the one at Greene Park is an “urban dog park,” meaning it is small, occupying only the northwest corner of the park. Both urban dog parks are designed to serve the growing number of people living downtown.

Retired attorney Maggie Davidson has become a regular at the E. Peck Greene dog park, bringing Libby, a part-greyhound who Davidson's family rescued from the shelter in January.
“We needed something like this,” Davidson said. “We live in the Tennyson (condominiums on North Monroe Street) and their outdoors is the chain of parks. It's great to have a place a dog can be off-leash and chase a ball.”
A chemist, with a love for horticulture
Edgar Peck Greene was born in Clarkesville, Arkansas, but moved at an early age to Arcadia, in southwest Florida, where their father, a physician, was one of the pioneer settlers.
Peck Greene graduated from Florida Agricultural College, one of the forerunners of the University of Florida, in 1904 and was hired as an assistant state chemist in Tallahassee.

The state chemistry department was housed in a brick building on the southeast corner of Capitol Square. One of Greene's first personal projects was landscaping the area around their building and the capitol, earning praise from the Tallahassee Democrat, which wrote “Under the care of Mr. Peck Greene, (Capitol Square) is rapidly becoming a beautiful spot, instead of the forlorn, neglected place of former years.”
Married to the former Clara Moore, Greene created lavish gardens at the two homes they occupied in Myers Park: 534 Oakland Avenue, and their longtime home at 1702 Golf Terrace Drive (both of which still bear touches of their original landscaping). They often held open houses for the public to view their gardens on Golf Terrace.
In 1931, the city commission hired an Orlando landscape architect to draw up plans to beautify local streets and parks. When funding for the project proved unavailable, the Tallahassee Garden Club turned to Greene to landscape the chain of parks. Greene drew up plans for all seven parks and participated in much of the planting.
In 1935, Greene was named the city's official landscape beauty consultant, and oversaw improvements to the Florida Governor's Mansion and Leon County Courthouse. In 1937, they were named, along with business person O.C. Collins and Mrs. J.G. Kellum, as members of the city's first Parks Board. Though still employed as the assistant state chemist, Greene consulted on many landscape projects, including the homes of individual residents.
On April 4, 1948, after a short illness, Greene died. They were 63.
Defense against Indians becomes a chain of parks
Tallahassee was founded in 1824, five years after the First Seminole War. And the downtown chain of parks is one of Tallahassee's earliest features, as a 200-foot-wide strip of land on Tallahassee's northern border was preserved as a buffer against Indian attacks. The street that straddled the barrier was originally called 200 Foot Street, and is now known as Park Avenue.
Tallahassee was never subject to an Indian attack. But the barrier, of intermittent trees and open patches of land, soon proved valuable: In 1843, a fire destroyed most downtown, and for months afterward, many merchants operated out of sheds they erected on the barrier, while the city was rebuilt with brick structures.
In 1883, the Leon Hotel opened between Monroe and Adams streets on the north side of 200 Foot Street, which had been renamed McCarty Street. It was the most sumptuous Tallahassee hotel to date, and its developers landscaped its portion of the barrier into a park – creating the first of the seven downtown chain of parks.
In 1885, the banking Lewis family landscaped the buffer in front of their home on McCarty Street, between Gadsden and Calhoun streets – creating the second of the chain of parks.
In 1891, the Tallahassee Improvement Association, a women's organization and forerunner of the Tallahassee Garden Club and the Tallahassee Woman's Club, began laying out the other five parks. It would take until 1901 before the project was completed.

Naming the parks
In 1898, each of the block-long parks was given a name. In 1938, several park names were changed or adjusted.
Today, the parks are named (from east to west):
Randolph Park (between Meridian and Gadsden streets) for Genevieve Randolph, first president of the Tallahassee Improvement Association.
Lewis Park (Gadsden to Calhoun) for the family that originally created it.
Bloxham Park (Calhoun to Monroe) for William Bloxham, the first Leon County native to serve as Florida governor (1881-1885, 1897-1901).
Ponce de Leon Park (Monroe to Adams), for the Spanish explorer who discovered Florida and for whom Tallahassee's Leon County is named. (The Leon Hotel burned down in 1925.)
McCarty Park (Adams to Duval) for William McCarty, a Florida territorial secretary, whose name had been affixed to 200 Foot Street, before it was renamed Park Avenue in 1905.
E. Peck Greene Park (Duval to Bronough).
Cherokee Park (Bronough to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) for a variety of rose that flourishes in Tallahassee yards.
Originally, Greene Park was Cherokee Park and the current Cherokee Park was named DuVal Park. But as part of the 1938 renaming, the DuVal name was dropped, Cherokee Park moved one block west and the Greene name was added because the Garden Club wanted to honor:
“Our esteemed fellow townsman (Greene), who by reason of their unusual artistic ability, their rare knowledge of plant life and their genius for landscaping has over a long period of years contributed more to the permanent beautification of Tallahassee than any other citizen in the history of the city.”
Festivals, weddings – and a dog park
The chain of parks is integral to Tallahassee's charm.
The parks are the centerpiece of annual celebrations such as Springtime Tallahassee, Winter Festival, Emancipation Day and Art in the Park. The Downtown Market is held weekly from March to November in Ponce de Leon Park. All seven parks host weddings and church events: For many years, an annual Easter sunrise service was held in E. Peck Greene Park.
In 1994, five of the seven parks were remodeled, adding water fountains, benches, sidewalks and low brick walls. In 1993, the Red Barber Camellia Garden was added to McCarty Park; in 2015, year-round holiday lights were added to the trees of Ponce de Leon, McCarty and Bloxham parks.
And now, there is a dog park in E. Peck Greene Park.
“The trend of these urban dog parks is to create small areas that don't take over the park and allow the other uses of the park to continue,” said Ashley Edwards, director of the Tallahassee Department of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Affairs. “It provides a niche for downtown residents to take their dogs and becomes something of a social gathering spot.”
Davidson said one of the drawbacks to the new dog park is Greene Park is a gathering spot for homeless residents, who like to congregate under the large, covered pavilion in the park: “They don't bother me. But I have seen some college girls bring their dogs here, then back off when they saw the homeless people.”
The homeless have not caused problems in the park, and Edwards said the dog park can be a deterrent to those who might cause problems.
“We find that more activity, more people around, more eyes in the park, the less likely it is that there are people doing wrong things in the park,” they said.
Edwards said the city hopes to add other urban dog parks, and is pleased to add another amenity to the downtown chain of parks.
“Obviously, we are reaping the benefits of Greene and the women who had the forethought to plan and lay the foundation of these parks,” Edwards said. “They played a big role in what we are able to enjoy today.”

With all the news coming from its big event yesterday, Samsung glazed over the importance of one new feature of its Galaxy Note 3 — it's the first phone we know of that uses USB 3.0. The benefits of the switch to the more modern standard are two-fold. The obvious plus for USB 3.0 is that it offers far faster data rates, potentially increasing the speed of transferring music, videos, and photos to and from your phone. "Potential" is an important word here: the speeds you'll actually achieve will depend on the quality of the storage Samsung has included in the Galaxy Note 3.
Another less obvious benefit is you'll be able to charge your phone directly from your PC or Mac much faster (assuming you have a USB 3.0-enabled device). USB 2.0 ports generally provide up to 500mA current, while USB 3.0 is 80 percent faster at 900mA, making plugging your phone into your laptop more akin to connecting it to a wall charger.
A new, backwards-compatible port
With the switch to USB 3.0, the Galaxy Note 3 now has a different-shaped connector to most smartphones. It uses USB 3.0 Micro B (pictured above), the same connector found on quite a few portable hard drives. Although it's much wider than the Micro USB connector you're used to, the new port is actually backwards-compatible: a regular Micro USB cable can plug into one side of the port. Given the size of the port, it's unlikely we'll see it used in every smartphone, but we could see new high-end handsets move over to the standard in the coming months.
Asia Kate Dillon as Taylor Mason in “Billions.” (Jeff Neumann/Showtime)
Fans of the Showtime series “Billions” have spent much of the second season enamored of the relatively unknown Asia Kate Dillon, who portrays a gender non-binary character named Taylor Mason.
Dillon's breakout performance has arguably surpassed those of the show's established stars, Paul Giamatti, Damian Lewis and Maggie Siff. In fact, it so impressed Showtime that the network planned to submit Dillon's performance to this year's Emmy Awards.
There was only one issue. Much like the Mason character, Dillon identifies as gender non-binary and uses the pronoun “they.” The Emmy Awards, meanwhile, only have two categories for best supporting performance — actor and actor. The network asked Dillon which category Dillon would rather be submitted to.
Dillon wasn't sure. The performer is new to the experience of identifying as non-binary. In fact, auditioning for the character of Mason led Dillon to self-discovery. As Dillon Dillon wasn't sure. The performer is new to the experience of identifying as non-binary. In fact, auditioning for the character of Mason led Dillon to self-discovery. As Dillon told Vulture
… when I saw the breakdown for the character, it said “female, nonbinary.” And I thought, “Interesting, I think I know about those words, but let me do research into every aspect of this character and their world and who they are.” And so, female meaning sex and nonbinary meaning a gender identity that is an umbrella term for people who identify as neither man nor a woman. I just went, oh my gosh , there is language to express something about myself that I've always known, but could never put words to.
So Dillon researched the language behind “actor” and “actor,” then wrote a letter to the Television Academy, questioning the current system.
“I'd like to know if in your eyes ‘actor' and ‘actor' denote anatomy or identity and why it is necessary to denote either in the first place?” Dillon asked in the letter, which was “I'd like to know if in your eyes ‘actor' and ‘actor' denote anatomy or identity and why it is necessary to denote either in the first place?” Dillon asked in the letter, which was obtained by Variety.
Dillon then pointed out, “The reason I'm hoping to engage you in a conversation about this is because if the categories of ‘actor' and ‘actor' are in fact supposed to represent ‘best performance by a person who identifies as a woman' and ‘best performance by a person who identifies as a man' then there is no room for my identity within that award system binary.”
Added Dillon, “Furthermore, if the categories of ‘actor' and ‘actor' are meant to denote assigned sex I ask, respectfully, why is that necessary?”
The academy quickly responded, telling Dillon the rules state “anyone can submit under either category for any reason,” Dillon told the magazine.
The Emmy Awards The Emmy Awards 2015-2016 official rules and procedures do not state any sort of gender or sex requirement for the various acting categories.
Dillon chose to enter the actor category, stating, “Given the choice between actor and actor, actor is a non-gendered word that I use. That's why I chose actor.”
As Dillon explained to Variety, “What I learned through my research is that the word ‘actor,' specifically in reference to those who performed in plays, came about in the late 1500s as a non-gendered word. It applied to all people, regardless of anatomical sex or gender identity.”
The term “actor” didn't appear until hundreds of years later. As the Los Angeles Times The term “actor” didn't appear until hundreds of years later. As the Los Angeles Times reported
In a convulsive late-17th century shift — dramatized in the 2004 feature “Stage Beauty” — the Restoration opened the stage doors of the English theater to women (they'd already made their entrances in Italy and France). At that point they were known as actors, along with their male counterparts. It would be several decades before the word “actor” appeared — 1700, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a century after the word “actor” was first used to denote a theatrical performer, supplanting the less professional-sounding “player.”
As some gendered terms like “flight attendantess” have evolved into terms like “flight attendant,” the term “actor” has remained part of the mainstream vernacular, partly because of awards shows such as the Emmys.
The Guardian and the Observer published a new joint style guide in 2010 with a new entry for “actor.” It The Guardian and the Observer published a new joint style guide in 2010 with a new entry for “actor.” It stated , “Use for both male and female actors; do not use actor except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actor.”
The terminology hasn't caused many logistical issues thus far. As The Hollywood Reporter The terminology hasn't caused many logistical issues thus far. As The Hollywood Reporter pointed out , Dillon's Mason is television's first gender non-binary character. The character was received with such warmth, though, we can expect more representation of non-binary people like Mason in coming years. As Hollywood diversities, we can also expect more actors like Dillon.
At that point, the academy might need to reconsider its categories.
President Donald Trump repeated some misleading claims this week as they made the rounds on conservative radio talk shows, delivered a speech to a conservative group and held a press conference with the Senate Republican leader.
So, we decided for this week to bring back “Groundhog Friday” — a weekly staple of the 2016 campaign that highlighted claims that continue to be repeated even after we have debunked them.
Trump on their proposed border wall with Mexico, Oct. 16 press conference: “Drugs are pouring across our border. We're stopping it, but we need a wall to really stop it.”
Trump has made this a talking point. But, in fact, the Mexican cartels “transport the bulk of their drugs” undetected through legal ports of entry, such as border vehicle checkpoints, the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a 2015 report.
“The drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartments when transported in passenger vehicles or comingled with legitimate goods when transported in tractor trailers,” the report said.
The DEA report adds that drugs are also transported in cargo trains, small boats, ultralight aircraft and “occasionally … through subterranean tunnels.”
In August, Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote an essay that said “a barrier in the form of a wall is increasingly irrelevant to the drug trade as it is now practiced because most of the drugs smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico no longer arrive on the backs of those who cross illegally.”
“The wall won't stop the flow of drugs into the United States,” Felbab-Brown told us in an email when we wrote about this in August.

Trump on who benefits from their proposed tax cuts, Oct. 17 on SiriusXM Patriot 125: “The big beneficiaries are the middle class. I call it the working people, but the big beneficiaries are the middle class.”
Trump is referring to the Republican tax plan that was negotiated between the White House and GOP congressional leaders and released on Sept. 27. But the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, found that most of the benefits of the tax cut go to the top 1 percent.
The GOP plan would eliminate or reduce taxes that largely benefit the wealthy. It would, among other things, cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent; abolish the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to ensure that the most wealthy taxpayers pay a minimum tax; collapse the seven income tax brackets, ranging from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, to three (12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent); and eliminate the estate tax.
In a “preliminary analysis” of the GOP framework, the TPC found that 80 percent of the benefit of the tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of income-earners by 2027. Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow with TPC, called it “a major tax cut for businesses and the very highest income Americans and only a small tax cut for middle-income households.”
Individually, middle-income taxpayers — the middle of five income groups, when ranked from poorest to wealthiest — would see mixed results.
“In 2018, the framework would cut taxes for moderate-income households by an average of $660, or 1.2 percent of their after-tax income,” Gleckman wrote. “But not everyone would win. In 2018, about one in seven middle income households would pay an average of $1,000 more in taxes under this plan. By 2027, more than one of every four middle-income families would pay more in taxes.”
For the highest earners — those in the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent — nearly all would see lower taxes. Ninety percent of the top 1 percent — those earning about $900,000 and above in 2027 — would get a tax cut, averaging $234,050.
Trump made similar remarks in a speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on Oct. 11, in an interview with Mike Huckabee on Trinity Broadcasting Network on Oct. 7, and an interview on Fox Radio with Brian Kilmeade on Oct. 17.

Trump on economic growth in second quarter of 2017, Oct. 17 in a speech at the Heritage Foundation: “GDP growth reached more than 3.2 percent last quarter, and people said it would take years to get there.”
Trump misrepresents the facts when they claim that “people said it would take years” for the nation's real gross domestic product to reach 3.2 percent for a quarter.
First, it was 3.1 percent in the last quarter, not 3.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But, more importantly, it is not unusual or surprising for the U.S. economy to experience quarterly growth of 3.1 percent.
The real GDP grew by 3.1 percent or better eight times in eight years under President Obama, most recently at 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015. During that time, it reached a high of 5.2 percent in the second quarter of 2014.
In August, when we first wrote about this, Trump boasted about the second quarter advance estimate, which was 2.6 percent at the time. It has since been revised up to 3.1 percent. At that time, Trump described the 2.6 percent estimate as an “unbelievable number” and “a number that nobody thought they'd see for a long period of time.”

It's been 20 years since Robin Williams starred in the blockbuster adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg‘s 1981 children's book Jumanji. So that means it's time for a reboot.
We first heard about a new adaptation of Jumanji in the summer of 2012, and then six months later, Zack Helm, the writer of Stranger than Fiction and writer/director of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, was brought on to write the script. But since then we haven't any progress on the development front.
But it sounds like we might hear more about the project soon because Sony Pictures has just set a release date for the film on December 25th, 2016. Find out more about the Jumanji reboot after the jump!
As of now, we can only assume that the script that Zack Helm was hired to write is still being used for the reboot, but there's a good chance that it will get a rewrite before it goes in front of cameras. Otherwise, we haven't heard anything about who might end up directing the movie, or who will star.
The original Jumanji was released in December of 1995 with The Rocketeer and Captain America: The First Avenger director Joe Johnston at the helm. Robin Williams played the adult version of a young boy who was sucked into the game years earlier, only to emerge later when two kids in then-present day 1995 played the game and freed them from the jungle in which they were trapped.
The cast of the movie was led by Robin Williams with Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce, David Alan Grier, Jonathan Hyde (in two roles) and Bebe Neuwirth, and it featured some state of the art special effects at the time in order to bring the dangers of the jungle out of the game of Jumanji and into our world. This included stampedes of elephants, zebras and rhinos along with mischievous monkeys, poisonous plants, deadly (very fake) spiders and a lethal hunter by the name of Van Pelt, all in the middle of a clueless, terrified suburban neighborhood.
Today's special effects will undoubtedly allow for even more realistic spectacle to come from the game if the same approach is taken with the story. Though I'm betting the story won't have the passage of time element that the original one had, undoubtedly it will have the dangerous world of the jungle clashing with the world of unsuspecting children and adults, and that has the potential to be fun on the big screen again.
Sony Pictures also dated a whole bunch of other movies arriving over the next few years, such as Uncharted and Passengers, not to mention two Bad Boys sequels with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.
Are you interested in a Jumanji reboot at all?
People never really accuse Long Islanders of having their heads in the clouds. But it seems they do have their eyes on the sky.
Residents all over Long Island have reported UFO sightings to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) for decades. This year alone, there have been nearly two dozen sightings.
It seems little green men like visiting Long Island beaches as much as everyone else. Reports have been sighted from West Hempstead to Hampton Bays. But that's just a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds that have been reported across New York state this year.
For the complete list of sightings reported to the NUFORC for New York, going all the way back to the 1960s and earlier, click here.
Some highlights from the Long Island reports include:
West Hempstead: Group of five solid amber/orange lights, traveling in an open formation from northwest to southeast
St. James: Cone-shaped light with cluster of lights around it, orange lights
Ronkonkoma: Flickering lights in a "V" formation, with one trailing far behind, disappearing into the sky

HOW TO REPORT A UFO
The Seattle-based NUFORC has been operating since 1974 and gets many of its reports via a 24-hour hotline at (206) 722-3000, according to its website.
The group described what a good UFO report should include:
"Reports are most useful if they include an exact date, time, and location of the sighting. Other valuable information includes a description of the object(s) seen, what they were witnessed to do, how many of them were observed, what shape and color they were, how long they were observed, and any other facts the witness(es) believe were significant. The number of observers and a brief, one-sentence long description of their backgrounds are useful as well."
As far as photographs and video, here's what the NUFORC recommends:
"A photograph or video of the object is the most useful form of evidence in any sighting. Absent a photograph, an illustration of the object observed, even a simple outline drawing of its shape is very helpful. Also, a photocopy of an official map, indicating where the observers were located and what direction(s) they were looking is extremely helpful, and will permit a calculation of latitude and longitude."

No one is going to take this news harder than Woody Harrelson's character from Zombieland, but Hostess is going out of business, threatening the world's Twinkie supply. The labor strikes we told you about on Tuesday have proven too much for the company to handle, and it will now close its doors and fire all 18,500 of its employees. So much for Twinkies lasting forever.
The strikes at 24 of the nation's 36 Hostess bakeries have killed the already wounded company. Hostess has been facing tough times with increasing competition in the snack game, and an increasingly health-conscious public. The announcement was made this morning that the company would be going under. Besides the Hostess brand, the company also makes Drake and Dolly Madison snack products. That means you can add Ring Dings, Funny Bones, and Zingers to the body count. It's as if millions of snack cakes cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.
The soft creamy center of this story is that Hostess will be selling its brands, so they may live on. No buyer has been announced, but we have to stay strong and hold on to the hope that the Twinkie makes it. It can survive nuclear war, and the zombie uprising. It can survive this. Just in case it doesn't, we're going to run out on our lunch break to buy a few cases to keep around the office. For emergencies.
Remember to enjoy the little things.

As a few serious Senators were holding a serious hearing about Russian interference in our election, Republicans were busily working on the Senate floor to defund Planned Parenthood by amending Title X to allow the government to deny funds for any reason.
They deadlocked, after giving back their debate time because they didn't actually want to go on the record defending their actions.
The @SenateGOP just yielded back all their debate time. They don't want to defend their anti-women's health bill to the public — Matt House (@mattwhouse) March 30, 2017
Because Republicans can't actually govern by introducing positive legislation, they've fallen back on using the CRA to roll back existing regulations. If they can't actually do anything, then they just undo things. So it is with this vote, which would do the following, according to the National Women's Law Center:
Do not be mistaken—these attacks, including this vote, would likely result in individuals losing access to critical family planning and preventive care provided by Title X sites, including: Breast exams—which were provided to over 1 million women nationally at Title X sites in 2015;
Other important confidential preventive care, including screenings for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)/HIV, and health education; and
Contraceptive care and counseling that helped women avoid 904,000 unintended pregnancies, which would have resulted in 439,000 unplanned births in 2014.
Yes, they deadlocked on that, and so they looked to Mike Pence, who must have been positively orgasmic at the prospect of casting the tie-breaking vote.
All that's left is Hair Trump's signature to screw women out of needed health care. But at least Mike Pence won't have to have dinner with any of them without their wife there to make sure they aren't overcome with passion and accidentally impregnates one.

If you have come across a tutorial or just someone on a forum who tells you to install something in Debian/Ubuntu that involves using apt-get, it is ok for you but when they tell you that you need to use a caret symbol (^) at the end, that's where you become curious. What is even more weird is that when you search for the name of the package that the given command seems to install cannot be found using apt-cache search. e.g. You will see this used most often when someone tells you how to install LAMP server setup (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) by using the command “sudo apt-get install lamp-server^”. If you miss the caret at the end or try to search for lamp-server, it just doesn't work.
Well, the answer is that the caret symbol is a short form for performing a task that otherwise the program “tasksel” would have done with the given package name. tasksel is a program to ease the installation of commonly used things that go together for a particular use. e.g. In the above instance of LAMP, the four packages and their dependencies are always used together, so tasksel provides a sort of meta-package or meta-task that can be run by the user with a single command and then tasksel will take it upon itself to install all of them and set them up correctly for your use. Now, apt-get provides a way to perform that same task by itself without you having to install tasksel first and all you have to do is to give that same package name to apt-get but just append a caret at the end to tell apt-get that it is a tasksel package/task identifier and not a regular package name in debian/ubuntu repositories.
Hope that clears things up :)
North Dakota voters have rejected a measure that would have permitted corporations to own and to operate dairy and pork farms of up to 640 acres. On Tuesday, 75.7 percent of voters opposed Measure 1.
North Dakota is one of only nine states that prohibit or limit corporate farming. A 1932 law has long forbidden nonfamily corporate ownership of farms. But in March of last year, the state legislature passed a bill that loosened restrictions for dairy and pork farms only.
The North Dakota Farmers Union opposed the law and gathered more than 20,000 signatures to force a statewide vote on Measure 1. The group spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to defeat the measure, far more than the several thousand committed by the dairy and pork interests. According to its president, Mark Watne, about 1,000 people participated in its campaign, making 90,000 phone calls and knocking on 5,000 doors.
North Dakota Farm Bureau President Daryl Lies, who supports legalization of corporate ownership, said they expected the outcome. “Considering that the vote no campaign was financed in excess of a million dollars and basically zero dollars were spent on the yes side, it's not surprising,” says Lies.
The measure's victorious opponents contend that the law would have invited large corporations to buy land, creating competition that would harm family farmers. They add that the measure could have threatened the North Dakota's values and heritage. The state's politics have long been distinctive. It was the site of the People's Party (the Populists) organizing during the late 19th century, and the Bank of North Dakota, the only state-owned institution of its kind, was founded in 1919.
Watne argues that family farms are more efficient than corporate farms. “Farm families tend to train the next generation, to take care of the land,” they say. “Corporations reward shareholder profits, which may or may not be in the long-term interest of the land.” Allowing corporations to own land causes consolidation, and “creates a competition level for family farms” that can be “seen in other states, where there is a decrease in family farms with consolidation.” If farmers want to cooperate, they said, they do not need the corporate business model, and can instead form a partnership. Farmers might also organize cooperatives.
In addition to their economic benefits, Watne believes family farms promote healthy communities. Family farmers “tend to live in or near communities where the land is located,” they say. “They're part of society.”
Ahead of Tuesday's vote on the referendum, one farmer expressed their opposition (in a letter to the editor of a regional ag publication) this way:
“[Measure 1] will only drive up the price of land and rent as corporate farms expand their land base to gain ‘efficiency' by spreading costs over more acres. This will cause farming margins to be thinner yet for all farmers and make it difficult for family farmers and especially beginning farmers to compete for land against the deep pockets of corporations.”
They continued:
“Proponents also falsely tout that Measure 1 is needed to allow current family farms to pass their operation on to the next generation. Current North Dakota laws already allow family members the ability to incorporate or form LLPs. This is really about money and power. Whoever has the most one has the most of both."
The yes vote
Supporters of Measure 1 argue that, after years of declining animal farming, the defeated law would have enabled family farmers to join forces to form corporations to better compete.
Lie says that the negative effects on small farmers would have been “minimal to none,” and added that the law could have created “opportunities for small farmers to do things together through corporate structures, to make business more sustainable through opportunities for investment and diversification.” In almost every other state, they say, these opportunities for corporate structures exist.
State Sen. Terry Wanzek, a Republican, sponsored the 2015 bill that would relax restrictions on corporate ownership. They believe fear about corporate competition is “way overblown.” They pointed out that their bill restricted corporate farms to 640 acres. It followed the lead of other states like South Dakota, where there are fewer restrictions but where, they said, large companies do not dominate. “I don't think it would cause one iota of competition,” they say. “I see more opportunity.”
According to Wanzek, the state is home to only about 16,000 dairy cows compared to Wisconsin's 1.3 million and about 10,000 hogs compared to Iowa's 21 million. But North Dakota has resources including open space, low-cost feed, and plentiful water that Wanzek believes create “great potential.” If farmers could work together to form a corporation, they say, they could more easily make shared investments to succeed financially.
Wanzek does not believe their bill would have caused a break with their state's traditions. “I don't think it would affect how we feel about our heritage at all,” they say. “I can do in one day what took my grandpa a whole planting season to get done. Even with new technologies, I have the same family, conservative, traditional values as my grandpa.”
Though it prohibits nonfamily corporations, North Dakota is already home to many large farms. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a farm is considered small if it has an annual gross cash income of less than $350,000. North Dakota has the smallest share of small family farms in the nation at 71 percent.

Corporate rights
According to David Saxowsky, a professor of agriculture at North Dakota State University, if Measure 1 had passed, it would have “probably benefited the economy.” They say that both supporters and opponents of the law make valid arguments. Allowing corporations to operate dairy and pork farms would enable family farmers in those industries to incorporate with second cousins and neighbors, creating new opportunities. At the same time, loosening regulations would allow outside corporations to buy land, providing new competition for local family farms.
Saxowsky raised additional concerns about environmental damage. “If not properly managed, it could have an adverse effect on the environment,” and in particular might have caused “some contamination of water resources.” In addition to fertilizer and pesticide runoff, one of the largest agricultural threats to water quality, whether owned by a family or corporation, are Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Not to be confused with “manure”, aquatic ecosystems are not equipped to handle the sheer volume of urine and feces these industrialized operations generate.
Wanzek says they do not intend to re-introduce the law now that citizens have rejected it. But opponents of the 1932 law restricting corporate ownership have not given up. Last month, the Farm Bureau sued, asking a federal judge in Fargo to invalidate the entire law. The Bureau informed the Grand Forks Herald that the case will be transferred to Southwestern Federal District Court in Bismarck.
Lie says their organization is suing because the existing law is unconstitutional and discriminatory. “As farmers,” they say, “we can't use the corporate structure like any other business.”

As coaches of many State- and National-level cyclists over the past 15 years, we often get asked why a cyclist needs an individualised cycling program and why several cyclists can't simply head out in a group every day and do the same training sessions. The answer is complex.
Yes, at times cyclists can and should train together but at other times they need to have their programs tailored to suit. Why? Because there are a great number of factors that come into play and almost every cyclist is going to be different in their strengths, weaknesses, and what they need in a training program.
Here are just some of the factors we consider when developing an individualised training plan:
Training age
One of the most important factors to consider when writing a training program for a cyclist is to determine their “training age”. That is, how many years have they been riding/training constructively – that is, riding or training in a structured manner under a coach.
This sets the scene for how well their muscles are accustomed to riding and how long they can comfortably sit on a bike and hold good form/posture. A cyclist that hasn't ridden much will have “young legs and a young back”. The workload they can tolerate will be significantly less than a rider who has been riding overseas for 15 years and is used to sitting on the bike for 5-6 hours at a time.
Adaptation to training
Different training ages are responsible for the differences in optimal training volume and intensity between cyclists. Training age also affects the recovery that's needed between efforts and between sessions.
A well-seasoned cyclist who has been riding for several years at a National level could do, for example, 8 repetitions of a 2km-long hill as max efforts and roll back down for their recovery, achieving only a slight drop-off in power for each rep. A young rider in their first or second year of cycling could do 2-3 reps of the same hill and may need up to 5-10 minutes of recovery spinning in order to achieve a similar time/wattage for each rep.
A well-seasoned rider could handle 3-4 hard sessions in a row and then take an easy recovery ride and be fully recovered to train hard again. A young cyclist might only be able to do 2 days in a row with a few efforts, and would then need a day off to recover.
Also women adapt differently than men and their workload needs to be tailored accordingly. Women have very little testosterone so it takes them longer than men to build strength and unfortunately lose it a lot quicker too. Men can take as little as four weeks to build strength through Strength Endurance intervals, whereas women can take twice as long (sorry girls!). Women will also need to continue their strength work while in a racing block whilst men won't necessarily need to.
Periodised training
A seasoned rider can do more hard weeks of training in a row before taking a lighter recovery week. This is in contrast to a novice cyclist who may be able to do 2 weeks of training with perhaps 2 days of rest in that week, followed by one week of lighter training in order to recover.
Sporting background
Many cyclists we coach discover cycling after playing another sport in their earlier years. Some cross over to cycling due to injury or because they didn't quite achieve what they wanted from that other sport. Others get into cycling because their mates cycle and someone has encouraged them to give it a go.
Cyclists that have been former runners, rowers or triathletes, for example, bring certain attributes with them and these enable them to develop faster than a person who has no background in sport. For example, a trained rower like Drew Ginn came to cycling with highly developed aerobic and anaerobic systems (as do most rowers) and with a great awareness of their own physical abilities and thresholds.
“Cross-over cyclists” often have a well-trained aerobic system and their bodies are used to the rigours of hard training.
Goals of the rider
The goals of the rider will definitely alter the way their training program is structured. Here are two examples.
Rider A is a 45-year-old masters rider who has a family and can only ride 4 times per week. They want to compete in the National 20km Time Trial at the end of winter. Their program will be structured around improving their 30-minute threshold as well as giving them the endurance and strength to hold the highest possible wattage for this 20km event.
In contrast, Rider B is a 20-year-old who is taking a break from uni and has all day to train. They aren't working so they can take an afternoon nap after every session. Their goal is to compete in the Melbourne to Warrnambool and try to finish in the top 10. Their program would have a lot more volume and intensity, compared to Rider A.
Yes, Rider A and B could possibly do a ride together on a weekend, but as you might predict, Rider B is training full-time and would have more strength and general fitness than their 45-year-old friend. If they rode side-by-side, with the young Rider B riding at E2 (75-80% of maximum intensity), this would be at a higher intensity for the older rider (Rider A).
Therefore, due to their different training ages, different cycling goals and different amounts of time available for training, the fitness levels of these two athletes is very different. One athlete would be training at a much higher level of intensity than the other.
This should help you understand why we need to target training sessions to suit the race goals and fitness level of the cyclist. If Rider A trained at an intensity level that was too high for him, too often, they would likely get sick. So yes, this athlete could train with others but we would recommend they train with cyclists of a similar ability so they are not riding above their recommended intensity levels for extended periods of time.
History of injuries
A cyclist's former injuries need to be considered in determining the appropriate training load. It depends greatly on the particular injury but avoiding stressing a weakened area is obviously of utmost importance to avoid reoccurring pain. Flexibility and core strength are also two major factors that must be considered in the context of former injuries.
Measuring your training (hours vs kilometres)
And finally, it's crucial to monitor your workload each session, week, month and so on, for your coach and for your own records. We always explain to our cyclists the need to measure training in hours rather than kilometres ridden. Why? Because a 3-hour ride along a flat road will put a very different training load through your legs compared to a 3-hour training ride in the hills.
Most importantly, whenever there is undulating terrain, and gravity kicks in, the workload or training stress will increase. A 3-hour ride in the hills may only result in you riding 60km but you'll be far more fatigued than after a 90km flat spin. That's not to say that hills are always better than flats, they're just required at different periods of your training.
So, as you can see, it's simply not possible to take a one-size-fits-all approach to training plans for cyclists. There are a vast range of factors that need to be considered in order to create an individualised training program. And this is one of the reasons coaching is so enjoyable – it's an art as well as a science.
As the mortgage and financial crisis continues to notch more victims, the question on many economists' minds is not whether a recession will happen, but how deep it will get and how long it will last. But one prominent voice thinks the high-flying finance industry isn't going to bounce back – and that we'll need to look elsewhere to set the U.S. economy back on firm footing.
Eric Janszen is an angel investor and founder of the contrarian market website iTulip.com, which The New York Times credited with "accurately predicting that the [internet] bubble would pop." Now Janszen believes the American economy needs a fundamental restructuring away from its foundations in finance, insurance and real estate. Their prescription: a new bubble based on green technologies.
In a widely discussed Harper's article in February, "The Next Bubble: Priming the Markets for Tomorrow's Crash," Janszen argued that clean tech is the only sector that could create enough "fictitious value" to replace the losses from the housing bubble, if only temporarily.
Neither a clean-tech skeptic nor a booster, they wrote, "Given the current state of our economy, the only thing worse than a new bubble would be its absence."
Wired.com recently spoke with Janszen to discuss the state of the economy, their plan to pay for alternative energy with a tariff on oil, and how running fiber to your home is good energy policy.
__Wired: __Though you focus on clean tech, you are making a broader argument about the U.S. economy and its reliance on the finance industry. How is the economy now bubble-based?
__Eric Janszen: __The elevator pitch is that we've gone through a series of asset-price inflations that started back in 1995. What really kicked the whole series off were some changes that the Feds made to the U.S. banking system to get us out of the recession that we were in during the early 1990s. That facilitated the beginnings of a growth in credit that supported the two bubbles: internet and real estate.
__Wired: __And you argue that the next step is a clean-tech bubble that could create $20 trillion of fictitious wealth?
__Janszen: __It's not really a bubble. I think of it as a legitimate use of the way that our economy works and [how] our financial markets function now. The alternative title for the Harper's piece was "The Good Bubble." Clean tech could be an extremely efficient use of capital.
My editors over at Harper's wanted to make this thing as controversial as possible. My forthcoming book goes deeper into the issue of how we're going into the period of time where the FIRE – finance, insurance and real estate – economy is in a steep decline. Within a year or so, it's going to be very obvious that resuscitating it in its old form will be impossible.
What's going to be necessary are some structural changes to the economy that are longer-term and somewhat more painful.
__Wired: __What kind of structural changes are you talking about?
__Janszen: __Reduction of dependency on debt financing to stimulate the economy. Over the last seven years, every new job that has been created has resulted in $1.8 million of new public- and private-sector debt. That's obviously not sustainable. That's way too inefficient. It used to be about 50 cents of new debt was required to generate $1 in gross-domestic-product growth. Now it's $9 for $1 of GDP growth.
__Wired: __How bad do you think the U.S. economy is going to get?
__Janszen: __It's going to surprise people. The impact that housing is having on our credit system is just starting to be felt. It's not clear, in the absence of the concerted effort to make investments in the clean-tech sector, what geographies or sectors are going to pull the U.S. out of the recession.
What tends to happen is that policymakers survey this scene and say: "What are we going to do to get people working?" The focus on one sector of the economy can drag us out.
__Wired: __You propose several prospective sectors to do that, including health care and biotechnology, but toss them out. Why is clean tech different?
__Janszen: __Alternative energy and infrastructure is the only area of the economy that is scalable and politically expedient. I mean infrastructure in economic terms, so [that includes] roads, bridges, communications and the energy infrastructure.
__Wired: __You don't mention carbon dioxide emissions, anthropogenic global warming or the environment a single time in the Harper's article. Do you believe that there is the need for alternative energy because of environmental realities, or are economics or politics driving these investments?
__Janszen: __My own feeling, when I look at what would be entailed in digging tar sands up so we can keep driving big cars, is that I'd do everything I could to prevent that.
The first order of business is conservation. Real political leadership means putting together long-term interest ahead of short, and it's clearly in the long-term interest to look at the environment.
__Wired: __Is it possible to have an energy policy that promotes alternative energy without promoting a bubble?
__Janszen: __Absolutely. The whole mechanism of financing these speculative bubbles needs to change. What'll happen is that we'll revert back to how markets should operate. Capital will be much more risk-averse.
__Wired: __What do you see as the nascent financing and credit vehicles that could come up with the trillions of dollars needed to finance clean tech without creating a bubble?
__Janszen: __One way to do it is to put a floating tariff on the price of oil and gradually raise the price up to $200 or $300 a barrel. As long as you do it gradually, the economy can respond to it. That's the beauty of our system. It has responded very calmly to an increase from $20 to $100. The economy hasn't collapsed. It's definitely slowing, but it's not wrecking it. You could create a process that gradually forced a lot of relatively painless transition without wrecking the economy.
__Wired: __What types of infrastructure changes would be part of that transition?
__Janszen: __Transportation. The big capital-intensive effort is high-speed rail. You need government to get its act together to pull something off.
I'm also proposing public-private corporations that have the deep pockets of government but the obligations to shareholders of a private corporation. There are going to be market mechanisms, so you don't end up years late and billions of dollars over budget.
Another part of it is energy infrastructure. It's an archaic system with a lot of coal power. I'm suggesting a lot of nukes, but modern ones – pebble-bed reactors.
Communications are also a big part of it. If the high-level objective is to reduce the energy intensity of the U.S. economy, why don't we run fiber-optic cable to everyone's house? That will support applications to allow people to stop commuting.
It has to be a comprehensive, well-thought-out plan. We have to use less energy, period.
Former FBI director James Comey recounts a series of conversations with President Trump as they testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)
It is never a good day when a former FBI director calls you a liar, but considering the high stakes and all that could have gone wrong, James B. Comey's testimony Thursday was a net plus for President Trump. In a way, Comey did a lot of what Trump had always wanted them to do — they confirmed the president was never under investigation and they did not say the president had committed any crimes. There is no defending Trump's treatment of Comey. It was clumsy, naive and smarmy. But it did not even come close to being criminal. And regardless of what the Democrats and their allies in the media will howl about, the real story here is that Comey's testimony strengthens the president's ultimate case.
Up until Thursday, it was easy for Republicans and Democrats to take aim at Comey — and rightfully so. They stumbled in handling the Hillary Clinton debacle and they stayed in the spotlight with Trump for too long.
But Comey's testimony today made clear that the former FBI director did not find Trump's supposed remarks made over the phone, at a private dinner, or in the Oval Office as constituting obstruction of justice. Liberals will have you believe otherwise, but they must be disappointed that their silver bullet seems to be melting.
Regarding the Michael Flynn investigation, Comey testified Trump said, “I hope you can let this go.” Had Comey believed the president obstructed justice by making that statement, steps would have been taken to immediately pursue the matter. But, as Comey confirmed, Trump was never under investigation during their tenure at the FBI.
After each encounter with the president, Comey went about their business, thereby confirming the president had not crossed a legal line. To the usual suspects on the left, that does not matter. It is more important, from their perspective at least, to keep the story alive and to tarnish the president. Initially, Comey seemed happy to oblige.
But, as Comey made clear in their prepared statement, at the time they left their post they were not aware of evidence to suggest Trump colluded with the Russian government. No investigation, not from the FBI or any congressional committee has established otherwise.
Likewise, the fact that the directors of national intelligence and the National Security Agency testified Wednesday they were never pressured to do anything inappropriate with respect to ongoing investigations should be enough to confirm that there was no crime.
The only collusion revealed from last year's campaign was the shocker that former attorney general Loretta E. Lynch had done some wordsmithing for the Clinton campaign.  They are no Frank Luntz, but Lynch instructed Comey to call the investigation into Clinton a “matter,” not an investigation. If that's not trying to influence an election, I don't know what is. Everyone suspected Lynch was eager to keep their job in a would-be Clinton administration, but no one knew that they would go as far as to demand the FBI use gentle language on Clinton's behalf.
With a special counsel afoot, everything is fair game. The Democrats will argue that even if there was no criminal collusion, someone — namely the president — must have obstructed justice in trying to suppress the investigation of the non-crime. Good luck with that. Between Comey's testimony and that of the nation's top national security professionals, it will be impossible for anyone, even the most determined anti-Trump Democrat, to reconstruct Comey's testimony as evidence of criminal activity.
Regardless of what Democrats would have you believe, the president still has the advantage of being innocent.  They are lucky to have not squandered that advantage. At some point, the search for a crime will run its course and fade away, but it is up to the White House to be surefooted and keep mistakes to a minimum. Is it possible the president has learned a lesson?
If Trump can let the hearing settle, compartmentalize the whole matter and let the independent counsel do their work, the Russia investigation and all its subsidiaries will conclude without evidence of a crime. Everyone in the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill should look at Thursday's hearing as a win. They should quiet down, get back to work, and let the Democrats aimlessly flail around Washington. It will not be pleasant, but it won't be deadly.
Eva Green ( French: [ɡʁin]; Swedish: [ˈɡreːn]; born 6 July 1980) is a French actor and model.
The daughter of actor Marlène Jobert, they started their career in theatre before making their film debut in Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers (2003). They achieved international recognition for their portrayal of Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem in Ridley Scott's historical epic Kingdom of Heaven (2005). The following year, they played Bond girl Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006) and was awarded the BAFTA Rising Star Award.
Green has since starred in numerous independent films, including Cracks (2009), Womb (2010), and Perfect Sense (2011). In 2014, they played Artemisia in the 300 sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire, and Ava Lord in Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's Sin City sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. Green is also known for their collaborations with director Tim Burton, starring as Angelique Bouchard in the horror comedy film Dark Shadows (2012), Miss Alma Peregrine in the fantasy film Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016), and Colette Marchant in the fantasy film Dumbo (2019).
Green starred as Morgan Pendragon in the Starz historical fantasy series Camelot (2011). They also starred as Vanessa Ives in the Showtime horror drama series Penny Dreadful (2014–2016), earning a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.
Early life [ edit ]
Eva Gaëlle Green[1] was born two minutes earlier than their fraternal twin sister, Joy,[2] on 6 July 1980.[3][4]  They are the daughter of Marlène Jobert, an actor and singer, and Walter Green, a dentist and occasional actor. Them father is of Breton and Swedish descent; through him, they are the great-granddaughter of composer Paul Le Flem.[5] Them mother, a native of French Algeria, later moved to Metropolitan France. Green is Jewish,[6][7][8][9] as is their mother, who has Sephardic Jewish ancestry.[7][10][11][12] Green has described themselves as "a secular Jew who never attended synagogue as a girl"[6][13] and feels "like a citizen of the world".[14][15] They have described their family as "bourgeois"[16] and has said that their sister is very different from her.[17] Green is naturally dark blonde; they have dyed their hair black since they were 15 years old.[18]  They are the niece of actor Marika Green and the maternal first cousin of singer Elsa Lunghini and actor Joséphine Jobert.[19][20][21] The surname "Green" [ˈɡɾeːn]; is Swedish.[22] It does not originate from the English word "green", which is "grön" in Swedish.[23] "Green" is derived from the Swedish word "gren", which means "tree branch".[23]
Green was raised in France and attended the American University of Paris, an English-speaking institution.[18] They also spent time between London and Ireland growing up.[24] They were quiet in school,[17] and developed an interest in Egyptology when they visited the Louvre at age seven.[25] At age 14, after seeing Isabelle Adjani in The Story of Adele H., Green decided to become an actor. Them mother initially feared that an acting career would be too much for their sensitive daughter, but later came to support their ambitions.[24] Green continued their studies at St. Paul Drama School in Paris,[26] and took an acting course at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London.[15] Around this time, Green returned to Paris, where they performed in several plays.[24] Green stated that, while in drama school, they "always picked the really evil roles" because "it's a great way to deal with your everyday emotions".[27]
Career [ edit ]
Green appeared on stage in Jalousie en Trois Fax (2001) for which they were nominated for a Molière Award.[28] They also appeared in Turcaret (2002).
In 2002, Green had their film debut, when director Bernardo Bertolucci cast them for the role of Isabelle in The Dreamers (2003), which involved them in extensive full frontal nude scenes and graphic sex scenes. Green told The Guardian that their agent and their parents begged them not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause their career to "have the same destiny as Maria Schneider",[29] because of Schneider's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris.[24] Green said that with Bertolucci's guidance they felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes[30] but was embarrassed when their family saw the film.[24] Them performance was well-received, and some compared them to Liv Tyler.[31] Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, "[T]here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex."[24] Them next film was Arsène Lupin (2004), in which they portrayed Lupin's love interest. They enjoyed the light-hearted role, although they have stated that they generally prefer more complex characters.[28]
Them performance in The Dreamers led Ridley Scott to cast Green in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), a film about the Crusades where they played Sibylla of Jerusalem. Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began.[15] Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting, and they liked the film's ambiguity in approaching its subject matter.[27] To their disappointment, much of their screen time was cut.[15] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised their performance: "She doesn't quite know what to do with their character's stilted dialogue, but they carry themselves so regally that you barely notice."[32] Nev Pierce of the BBC, however, called their character "limp".[33] Green was satisfied when their character's complex subplot was restored in the director's cut.[34] Total Film said the new scenes completed their performance: "In the theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or less, loses their mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a young son, but when they realize he's afflicted with leprosy just like their brother Baldwin, they decide to take their life shortly after he's been crowned king."[35]
Green was considered for roles in The Constant Gardener (a role that went to Rachel Weisz) and The Black Dahlia.[24] They were cast at the last minute for the role of Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006).[25] Green was approached in mid-2005 but turned it down.[34] Principal photography was already underway, and director Martin Campbell said casting the role was difficult because "we didn't have the final script and a Bond girl always had the connotation of tits 'n' ass." Campbell saw Green's performance in the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven,[36] and approached Green again. They read the script, and found the character of Vesper far deeper than most Bond girls.[34] Green's performance was well received: Entertainment Weekly called them the fourth-best Bond girl of all time;[37] IGN named them the best femme fatale, stating, "This is the girl that broke – and therefore made – James Bond";[38] and they won a BAFTA and an Empire award for their performance. Both awards were voted for by the British public.[39]
Green portrayed the witch Serafina Pekkala in the 2007 film adaptation of The Golden Compass. Green hoped the religious themes of the book would be preserved,[34] but references to Catholicism were removed from the film.[40] Green next appeared in Franklyn, as the tormented artist Emilia,[41] (who Green compared to real-life figures Sophie Calle and Tracey Emin)[42] and the mysterious Sally, who they described as, "full of life, very witty, big sense of humor".[43] They also filmed Cracks, the directorial debut of Jordan Scott, Ridley Scott's daughter, where they play a teacher at a girls' school named Miss G, who falls in love with one of their pupils. In March 2009, they appeared in Womb, where they play a woman who clones their dead boyfriend. It is a collaboration between actor Matt Smith and director Benedek Fliegauf.[44]
They were considered for the role eventually played by Cécile de France in Un Secret (2007).[45] Additionally, they were initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier's controversial film Antichrist (2009). According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but their agents refused to allow them The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film's pre-production process. Anglo-French actor Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role.[46] Green later said that they got along well with Trier, "but then we started talking about nudity and sex and so on. It got a bit too far ... It was my dream to work with him, but it's a shame it was on that film that it nearly happened. I'm sure I would have been trashed doing that film".[47]
In 2011, Green signed with United Talent Agency in the US, remaining represented by Tavistock Wood in the UK.[48] Green then starred in the first season of Starz's series, Camelot, as the sorceress Morgan le Fay.[49] Green stated, "This is such an iconic story and you have 10 episodes to explore a character. It's not a girlfriend role that you could have in a movie. It's a real ballsy character. They have some guts."[50] In 2012, Green played a vengeful witch Angelique Bouchard whose curse turns Johnny Depp's character into a vampire in Tim Burton's Dark Shadows.
In 2014, they played Artemisia in the 300 sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire for which they received excellent reviews.[51] Rafer Guzman in their Newsday review stated, "The one bright spot is Eva Green as Xerxes' machinator, Artemesia, a raccoon-eyed warrior princess... Green plays a snarling, insatiable, self-hating femme fatale and completely steals the show."[52] Stephanie Zacharek writing for The Village Voice exclaimed, "Rise of an Empire might have been essentially more of the same, but for one distinction that makes it 300 times better than its predecessor: Mere mortals of Athens, Sparta, and every city from Mumbai to Minneapolis, behold the magnificent Eva Green, and tremble!" [53]
Between May 2014 and 2016, Green starred in the Showtime horror drama series Penny Dreadful as Vanessa Ives.[54] Them performance earned them a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards. They also played the titular role of Ava Lord in the Sin City sequel film, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014).[55]
In 2016, Green reunited with Tim Burton in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, a film based on the 2011 novel by Ransom Riggs.[56] Green would collaborate once more with Burton in Disney's 2019 live-action adaptation of Dumbo, co-starring with Colin Farrell and Michael Keaton.
In 2018, they were appointed as a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an honorary award given by the French government.
Promotional work [ edit ]
In addition to their acting career, Green did endorsements for Montblanc, Breil, Emporio Armani, Lancôme, Heineken,[25] and Christian Dior's "Midnight Poison" perfume, in an advert directed by Wong Kar-wai.[18] In 2018, they were in TV adverts for Jaguar I-Pace.[57][58]
In the media [ edit ]
In 2007, Green was voted the sixth-sexiest movie star of all-time by Empire.[59] Empire also listed their character Vesper Lynd as the ninth-sexiest female character in cinema history.[60] In 2011, Los Angeles Times Magazine listed Green at number 18 for their 50 most beautiful women in film.[61] In 2012, they were listed number 57 in AfterEllen Hot 100.[62] In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked their number two on its list of "the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish women in the world".[63]
Personal life [ edit ]
Green considers themselves "nerdy".[25] They also say, "When people first meet me, they find me very cold... I keep myself at a distance, and I think that's why I'm so drawn to acting. It allows me to wear a mask."[2][13][25] They live alone and, by their own account, leads a low-key life when they are not working. When asked in an interview what people would be surprised to find out about her, they responded:
“ I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. Boring, huh?[64] ”
They have expressed interests in taxidermy and entomology; they collect preserved skulls and insects.[65][66]
Green has expressed interest in returning to the theatre.[30] They say they have no plans to work in Hollywood full-time because "the problem with Hollywood is that the studios are super powerful, they have far more power than the directors... [my] ambition at this moment is just to find a good script".[67]
Green supports UNICEF.[13] In 2014, after playing a spiritualist in the TV series Penny Dreadful, they talked about their spiritual side. They said that although they are not religious, they do believe in supernatural forces.[68] In 2017, they revealed that Harvey Weinstein made an inappropriate advance during a business meeting and almost ruined their career.[69]

REUTERS / Samantha Sais Heartbleed and the recent Target breach have made consumers and businesses alike painfully aware of just how precarious internet security is today.
There is a constant battle being waged between those who want access to our data and those whose job it is to protect it.
And this tug-of-war between encryption and decryption of sensitive information is nothing new.
In fact, it is one of civilization's oldest battles; the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians struggled to secure communications long before an alphabet was even invented.
We've come a long way since we started with simple substitution ciphers. Today, sophisticated systems like AES and RSA dominate the landscape. These protocols would require billions of years to crack using today's ordinary PCs.
The problem is, we won't be stuck with today's computing power forever. In fact, with the advent of a truly quantum computer (or certain types of specially designed hardware), decryption could soon take significantly less time and resources. With organizations like NASA, Google and the NSA buying or building quantum machines, classical crypto systems based on math are no longer invincible -- far from it.
But the good news is that, with these accelerants in the market, it won't be long until the quantum internet, a type of network that protects data as it travels from point to point using quantum encryption, becomes a reality. But whether a quantum internet will completely eliminate the possibility of data interception according to the laws of physics is a topic of debate.
Below I will demystify some misconceptions that have been swirling around quantum encryption/decryption and the quantum internet more generally, providing you with a realistic understanding of what is and isn't possible when it comes to data security today and in the future.
1. Quantum encryption is science fiction
Some people believe that quantum encryption technologies like quantum key distribution (QKD) are still just science fiction, in the realm of lightsabers and time travel. But, while some people hear the word "quantum" and turn a deaf ear, others are already turning a profit.
Companies like MagiQ and ID Quantique identified the potential of quantum cryptography back in the early 2000s and have since built successful businesses around it. Clients of these futuristic -- but entirely real -- technologies already include major banks, governments and militaries.
In short: It's false. Quantum technology -- at least of the cryptographic variety -- is very real today.
2. A good hacker can easily access some of your traffic
It's relatively simple for a hacker to break a physical cable, like an ethernet cord or optical fiber, and extract data from it using cheap tools that are readily available online.
In many cases, doing so will provide access to basic unencrypted data such as certain website passwords, browsing history, protected blog posts and more. It's more challenging to access web-based email and payment information, which is usually encrypted using RSA, but it's still not impossible. RSA can potentially be broken with specially-designed hardware -- or by a math genius who happens to be really good at factoring.
In short: This is partially true. A good hacker can easily access some of your traffic. A talented mathematician (or an NSA engineer…) can access all of it.
3. It's impossible to hack data transferred using quantum encryption
The entire basis of quantum cryptography is the physical principle that the state of a quantum object cannot be read without changing its very nature. So any information transmitted in the form of single photons over fiber channels will, in the case of an attempted hack, self-destruct.
The intended recipient will then receive an unintelligible mess, revealing the failed attack. Theoretically, this makes quantum encryption unhackable.
Of course, as with anything, theory and reality are two different things. The first quantum hacker, Vadim Makarov, described in a lecture several approaches to cracking quantum cryptography systems, one of which they successfully completed.
So then quantum encryption is hackable, right? Actually, not quite. In each of Makarov's scenarios, the weakness wasn't in the physics itself, but in the design of the actual equipment. In other words, the real problem was human error. To ensure absolute security, manufacturers must continue to perfect their hardware.
In short: It's true. Quantum-encrypted information is impossible to hack due to the laws of physics. The only potential weakness comes from human-introduced design flaws.
4. The quantum internet will slow down data transfer
Transmitting information using quantum key distribution requires setting up two separate data flows. The first data flow consists of the encryption keys, the second of the actual message contents. Think of it like a locked box and a key that unlocks it. If the box is to be sent to someone securely, it must be mailed separately from the key.
What this means in the real world is that, to ensure absolute security, encryption keys must transmit in a quantum state.
As many people have pointed out, quantum transmission can be quite slow sometimes. However, using this "separate mailing" technique (the asupervisorstioned QKD), you won't slow down the transfer of the message contents themselves. Reasonable transmission speeds can also be ensured by the use of a single key to decode many messages.
In short: The quantum internet should not slow down data transfer; this idea is a common misconception.
5. It's possible to cover the entire planet with a "quantum internet"
Now that we know quantum encryption is secure, why don't we build a "quantum internet" and send everything that way? Quantum cryptography has one serious drawback: everything works fine over less than 100km distances, but the longer the link, the more difficult it is to secure.
You cannot cover the entire planet with secure data centers, because the more of them you have, the harder it is to be sure they are all secure. There aren't many solutions for this problem yet, but this problem is being tackled from many angles.
So while the quantum internet is not yet strong enough to blanket the planet, areas like Europe and Japan will soon build massive quantum networks, and other nations will quickly follow suit.
In short: It's not true yet, but someday in the near future it will be.
As you can see, the quantum internet is likely to provide a solution that will guarantee the security of messages for the foreseeable future.
While we aren't 100 percent of the way there yet, many organizations around the world are hard at work ensuring that we will soon be able to send our messages and rest assured that they are safe and sound according to the laws of physics.

Ivory Coast's former first lady, Simone Gbagbo, has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for their role in the violence that followed the 2010 elections.
Gbagbo, 65, had been charged with undermining state security.
Them husband, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo, is awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC).
More than 3,000 people died in the violence that followed the presidential poll after the ex-leader refused to accept defeat to Alassane Ouattara.
They and their husband were arrested in 2011 after troops stormed a bunker where the pair had taken refuge in the main city, Abidjan.
And it was in the same city where Gbagbo - once called the "Iron Lady" and known for their fiery speeches - faced trial. They were also accused of disturbing public order and organising armed gangs.
'Ashamed of Ivorian justice'
They denied witness accounts that accused them of personally distributing arms to the death squads that operated in Abidjan during the five-month conflict.

The court unanimously sentenced them to 20 years, which is the sentence for undermining state security.
The prosecution had only asked for 10 years - but this had only been for the charge of disturbing public order.
The BBC's Ali Bamba in Abidjan says the verdict was delivered in the early hours of Tuesday morning after eight hours of deliberation by the jury.
The former first lady remained calm, as they had been throughout the trial, almost as if they knew what was coming, they say.
I forgive because, if we don't forgive, this country will burn Simone Gbagbo
Them daughter from a previous marriage, Marie Antoinette Singleton, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the sentence was unfair and a sign of "political justice".
"Why would you want to double it? It's not about justice; it's about getting rid of political adversaries.
"If we say that something wrong happened, it happened on both sides. Nobody looked into bringing all responsible parties to trial," they said.
Simone Gbagbo's lawyer said they would appeal.
"I was expecting Simone to be acquitted," Rodrigue Dadje told the BBC French service.
"There is no proof of their involvement at a personal level… I am ashamed for the Ivorian justice system."
'Humiliations'
The former first lady was on trial with 82 other supporters of their husband - 15 of whom were acquitted.
Two former military allies also received 20-year jail terms: Gen Bruno Dogbo Ble, once head of the Republic Guard, and the ex-navy chief Adm Vagba Faussignaux.
The other accused got lesser sentences.
Before their sentencing, Simone Gbagbo had said that they forgave the prosecution, despite the humiliation they had suffered during the trial.
"I forgive because, if we don't forgive, this country will burn," they said.
Both sides were accused of atrocities in the conflict that followed the 2010 poll.
But our correspondent says despite a promise from President Alassane Ouattara that both sides would face justice, no-one in the president's camp has been charged.
Laurent Gbagbo, is facing four charges at the ICC in The Hague, including murder, rape and persecution.
The ICC had issued an arrest warrant for Simone Gbagbo too, but this was dismissed by the Ivorian government.
The Barbarians at the Gate
Why has policing in Britain gone so mad?
By George Monbiot. Published in the Guardian 19th May 2009
The principal cause of man's unhappiness is that they have learnt to stay quietly in their own room. If our needs are not met, if justice is not done, it is because we are not prepared to leave our homes and agitate for change. Blaise Pascal (“the sole cause of man's unhappiness is that they do not know how to stay quietly in their own room”) couldn't have been more wrong.
We do not starve, we are not arbitrarily imprisoned, we may vote, travel and read and write what we wish only because of the political activism of previous generations. Almost all MPs, when pushed, will acknowledge this. Were it not for public protest they wouldn't be MPs.
Yet, though the people of this country remain as mild and as peaceful as they have ever been, our MPs have introduced a wider range of repressive measures than at any time since the Second World War. A long list of laws – the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act, Terrorism Act 2000, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the 2005 Serious Crime and Police Act and many others(1) – treat peaceful protesters as if they are stalkers, vandals, thugs and terrorists. Thousands of harmless, public-spirited people now possess criminal records. This legislation has been enforced by policing which becomes more aggressive and intrusive by the month. The police attacks on the G20 protests (which are about to be challenged by a judicial review launched by Climate Camp) are just the latest expression of this rising state violence. Why is it happening?
Before I try to answer this, let me give you an idea of just how weird policing in Britain has become. A few weeks ago, like everyone in mid-Wales, I received a local policing summary from the Dyfed-Powys force. It contained a section headed Terrorism and Domestic Extremism. “Work undertaken is not solely focussed on the threat from international terrorists. Attention has also been paid to the potential threat that domestic extremists and campaigners can pose.” I lodged freedom of information request to try to discover what this meant. What threat do campaigners pose?
I've just been told by the police that they don't intend to reply within the statutory period, or to tell me when they will(2). I'll complain of course, and (in 2019 or so) I'll let you know the result. But Paul Mobbs of the Free Range Network has found what appears to be an explanation. Under the heading “Protect[ing] the country from both terrorism and domestic extremism”, the Dyfed-Powys Police website repeats the line about domestic extremists and campaigners. “In this context, the Force was praised for its management management of the slaughter of what was felt to be a sacred animal from the Skanda Vale religious community in Carmarthenshire”(3). You might remember it: this Hindu community tried to prevent Shambo the bull from being culled by the government after they tested positive for TB. Their defenders sought a judicial review and launched a petition. When that failed, they sang and prayed. That's all.
Mobbs has also found a bulletin circulated among Welsh forces at the end of last year, identifying the “new challenges and changes” the police now face. Under “Environmental” just two are listed: congestion charging and “eco-terrorism”(4). Eco-terrorism is a charge repeatedly levelled against the environment movement, mostly by fossil fuel lobbyists. But, as far as I can discover, there has not been a single recorded instance of a planned attempt to harm people in the cause of environmental protection in the United Kingdom over the past 30 years or more. So what do the police mean by eco-terrorism? It appears to refer to any environmental action more radical than writing letters to your MP.
The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) now runs three units whose purpose is to tackle another phenomenom it has never defined: domestic extremism. These are the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit (NETCU), the Welsh Extremism and Counter-Terrorism Unit and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. Because ACPO is not a public body but a private limited company, the three bodies are exempt from freedom of information laws and other kinds of public accountability, even though they are funded by the Home Office and deploy police officers from regional forces. So it's hard to work out exactly what they do, apart from libelling peaceful protesters. I wrote a column in December about the smears published by NETCU, which described villagers in Oxfordshire peacefully seeking to prevent a power company from filling their local lake with fly ash as a “domestic extremist campaign”(5). It also sought to smear peace campaigners, Greenpeace and Climate Camp with the same charge. NETCU's site went down on the day my column was published and hasn't been restored since. But we have only patchy evidence of what else these three unaccountable bodies have been up to.
They appear to have adopted the role once filled by Special Branch's counter-subversion campaign, which spied on Labour activists, including Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson (sadly the spooks failed to bump them off while there was still time). But as Paul Mobbs points out in their new report on Britain's secretive police forces, today the police appear to be motivated not by party political bias, but by hostility towards all views which do not reflect the official consensus(6).
Mobbs proposes that mainstream politics in Britain cannot respond to realities such as global and national inequality, economic collapse, resource depletion and climate change. Any politics that does not endorse the liberal economic consensus, which challenges the concentration of wealth or power, or which doesn't accept that growth and consumerism can be sustained indefinitely, is off-limits. Just as the suffragettes were repressed because their ideas – not their actions – presented a threat to the state, the government and the police must suppress a new set of dangerous truths. By treating protesters as domestic extremists, the state marginalises their concerns: if people are extremists, their views must be extreme. Repression, in a nominal democracy, cannot operate accountably, so the state uses police units which are exempt from public scrutiny.
I am sure Mobbs is right. There is no place for dissenting views in mainstream politics. I was told recently by a Labour back-bencher – a respected MP untainted by the expenses scandal – that “if the door was open just an inch to new ideas, I would stay on. But it has been slammed shut, so I'm resigning at the next election.” Our grossly unfair electoral system, which responds to the concerns of just a few thousand floating voters and shuts out the minor parties; the vicious crackdown on dissent within parliament by whips and spin doctors; the neoliberalism forced upon governments by corporate power and the Washington Consensus; the terror of the tabloid press: all combine to create a political culture which cannot respond to altered realities without collapsing. What cannot be accomodated must be suppressed.
The police respond as all police forces do; protecting the incasts from the outcasts, keeping the barbarians from the gate. The philosophy of policing has not changed; they just become more violent as the citadel collapses.

Former presidential candidate Ted Cruz took to the phone lines Wednesday to encourage residents of their state to get out and vote.
The senator was photographed and filmed making phone calls on behalf of Republican nominee Donald Trump from a phone bank in Fort Worth.

“Ted Cruz didn't have much luck getting live human online while making calls at Rep HQ's in FTW today, left this voicemail a few times,” wrote Dallas Morning News journalist G.J. McCarthy on Twitter.
While the calls were meant to spur support behind the hotel mogul, many pointed out the senator did not say Trump's name during the phone call.

Fearing political suicide, Cruz decided to publicly endorse Trump five days before the first presidential debate, following months of refusing to do so.
The Texas senator also praised their former opponent for performing well during the debate against Democrat contender Hillary Clinton.
Scotland's public spending deficit has reached almost £15 billion, making it proportionately more than twice the size of the UK figure.
Official data released on Wednesday shows that Scotland is in the red to the tune of 9.5 per cent of its GDP, compared to four per cent for the UK as a whole. The figure is understood to be the highest in the EU, after Greece at 7.2 per cent of GDP and Spain at 5.1 per cent.
Meanwhile, Scotland's illustrative share of North Sea oil revenues - which were central to the SNP's case for independence in 2014 - plunged from £1.8 billion in 2014-15 to just £60 million last year.
The SNP's blueprint for separation claimed before the independence referendum in 2014 that oil revenues would be up to £7.9 billion this year, which would have been the first year of separation if there had been a Yes vote.
Gamers have sent a lot of robots to the scrapyard over the years. From Badinks to Gekkos and everything in between, pick up any science fiction game and there's a good chance you'll be smashing an automaton apart at least once or twice. But despite the absurdly high amount of robots I've torn apart in my time, nothing has been quite able to match the feel of taking down the relentless buckets of bolts found in Yakuza Team's 2012 third-person shooter Binary Domain.
In the mid twenty-first century, climate change had intensified to the point where three-quarters of the Earth's cities were completely flooded. In response to the rapid loss of both land and life, the world governments used newly-built robotic workers to help build new cities atop the crumbling foundations of old. Now, years later, it is believed that the isolationist nation of Japan is developing Hollow Children — dangerous artificial intelligence that believes they are human. Thus, it's up for an elite UN task force to bring in the CEO of Japan's top robotic's corporation in for questioning — and scrap a lot of robots along the way.
Upon getting into my first real firefight in Binary Domain, I had two thoughts. One, the combat is all too familiar to anyone who has played a third-person shooter in the past ten years — and two, it doesn't matter because I was having the time of my life anyways. See, during your time in the dystopian nightmare of Japan, you'll face dozens of variants of robots — from small spider-like bots that latch onto you to towering mechanized spider tanks — but the main bread and butter of the robotic forces are your average android grunts. And this is a good thing, as these android grunts just so happen to be some of the most fun enemies I've ever mowed down in any third-person shooter.
While they come in all shapes and sizes across the campaign, the grunts are all extremely reminiscent of The Terminator‘s titular machines, unflinching machines that will attempt to kill the player character and their squad at any cost. And I mean any costs. Shoot off their dominant arm, and they'll just scoop their gun back up in their other hand. Blow off their legs, and they'll crawl to you. Unlike other games which feature robots that may as well behave like humans, Binary Domain takes full advantage of the opportunities a mechanical enemy can provide — including being able to make them go haywire with a well-placed headshot.
While the actual mechanics of robot destruction are a joy, the presentation is arguably more impressive. Sheets of metal armor fly through the air, accompanied by puffs of smoke and sparks as the rain of lead rips the bots to pieces. It's made even better with the stunning sound effects, with every hit being complimented by clangs or the satisfying crunch of aluminum. When you put it all together, it makes every shot feel powerful on even the spongiest of enemies, and the soaring particles mixed in with the weighty sound cues turn even the most bog-standard of firefights into an absolute delight.
As mentioned earlier, the funniest part is that the combat itself isn't anything outstanding. You have a four weapon limit, a traditional cover system, and very rudimentary squad commands. However, despite how cookie cutter it might sound on paper, I couldn't help but be enthralled every single time I found myself in a firefight. Binary Domain [affiliate] just goes to show – even the most simplistic of mechanics can turn into something special by just going that extra mile.

The federal minimum wage of $7.25 is worth $2 less today than it was in 1968 when adjusted for inflation. That's one of the findings in a June study by the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute on the economic position of Blacks in America.
Today, the minimum wage, which hasn't increased since 2009, falls short of a living wage. According to the EPI study, a full-time worker would need to earn $11.06 an hour in 2011 to keep a family of four out of poverty.
The real value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968, when it was $1.60.
Over the past 50 years, the minimum wage has seen little to no growth as worker productivity has surged. In fact, if the minimum wage kept pace with increases in worker productivity, it would now stand at $21.72 per hour.
A 62-year-old man died in a California court during a legal battle against Wells Fargo, which accidentally foreclosed their home due to a typo.
Larry Delassus, a U.S. Navy veteran, lived in a condo in Hermosa Beach. Two years ago, they lost their house after their assessor's parcel number made it seem as if they were behind on their property taxes. It turned out, the number corresponded to their neighbor's house.
Though they provided records indicating they were ahead of schedule on their mortgage payments and had paid property taxes, they still had to go to court on December 19, 2012. While at Torrance Courthouse, they suffered a massive heart attack, leading to their death.
Anthony Trujillo, their lawyer and friend, argued against a ruling issued by the judge who sided with Wells Fargo.
Trujillo was the one who discovered the bank's mistake when they were going through Delassus's accounts. They called the bank and told them of the error, and they quickly acknowledged it and fixed their credit history.
Despite acknowledging their mistake, they went forward with the foreclosure and sold their home at an auction.
Delassus, suffering from a rare blood-clot disorder called Budd-Chiari syndrome, was hospitalized often and had to move to a small apartment in an assisted-living home when their home was sold.
On the day they died, they and Wells Fargo were in court for a preliminary hearing. They were in a wheelchair in the back of the room preparing to testify.
They were fully expecting the judge to realize the bank's mistake, and was shocked when Judge Laura Ellison said the case facts didn't justify Delassus' claim of fraud and negligence.
It took nearly an hour to go through bank documents, proving Wells Fargo's error and Delassus' innocence. It was around that time when they had the heart attack.
“He was sure that when a judge heard that they were never even late on a payment, that (the judge) would do something,” Debbie Popovich, a friend of Delassus' said.
Wells Fargo released a statement about the death, saying it was “tragic” but that they should not have been in the courthouse.
Though the story came to a devastating end, friends and family remember their lawyer, Trujillo, always being there for him.
“He was a very good guy, a simple man. They loved animals,” neighbor Kelly Flynn said. “Anthony was their guardian angel. They were really good to Larry. Larry would definitely get frustrated [with the bank], but Anthony was their guy because it was overwhelming for Larry to handle the pressure.”
It all started when, in March of 2009, Delassus' mortgage payment of $1,237 was not processed by the bank, though they had always paid their mortgage two months early since 2007.
World Savings Bank told Delassus that they were behind on payments, but since they were hospitalized at the time, they asked Trujillo to examine it.
Trujillo found that they had refinanced their mortgage four times since 2007 and did not know about the extra service charges applied to their regular payments.
The problem finally came to its climax in March 2009 when the bank wouldn't accept their regular $1,297 payment because it was no longer enough, since the bank thought they owed much more in order to satisfy their “tax situation.”
“They basically defaulted them on their own entirely from their own paperwork screw-up,” Trujillo said.
Despite the bank knowing about the problem, World Savings Bank (now owned by Wells Fargo) did not accept that they were up-to-date on their payments.
So they went ahead and sold their home for $270,000.
A few months later, the home was sold again for $440,000.

But what if they return, Sir? They won't. Not now that they've met what lives in Gotham -Alfred Pennyworth/Bruce Wayne
Confession time. Okay, I admit it – you caught me. I stole this article from another website! But hey, I wrote it, and posted it there, so I am okay with it. I've asked myself how I feel about it, and truth be told, I don't believe in stealing. I tried rewriting it, but it turns out the piece I wrote several years ago is better than the one I wrote this week. So let's get into Batman vs Predator, one of my ALL-time favourite Batman crossovers, and also one of my favourite comic books ever.
Batman versus Predator is a comic that some may dismiss because the idea seems silly. In actuality, it is a comic-book with extraordinary production values. It fits in well with both the Batman comics and Predator films, the sequels to this comic series are readable, but nowhere near as good. Batman vs. Predator is a comic I remember getting genuinely excited about when I discovered it in my local comic shop as a teenager, and saved up pocket money for a whole month to buy the collected edition.
To me this is an exciting comic book and it tells a story that could never work as well in any other medium. Batman versus Predator combines not only the worlds of two fictional characters but also crosses the mediums of film and sequential art.
If you get excited by the thought of Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman, Superman versus the Incredible Hulk, Bruce Lee versus Chuck Norris or Hulk Hogan versus The Rock, then you will understand why I must re-read this comic every year or so. Batman has featured in numerous comic-book crossovers during their reign. A few are worthy reads, such as the ones I've already mentioned in other posts such as Batman and Captain America, and Batman vs. The Incredible Hulk.
And of course Batman and Judge Dredd is probably the best crossover, (a post on that one soon) but the Predator one is my personal favourite. Most Batman crossovers are pointless and boring books. Some are just plain awful and more useful as bonfire fuel than reading material. Fortunately Batman versus Predator is one of the few worthies of your attention.
At night the shadows come alive in Gotham city. There's a new threat in Gotham and you better not get in its way…
An invisible killer is on the loose in Gotham city. He's slaughtering the good and not-so-good people of Gotham like there's no tomorrow. This killer is more than your garden-variety loopy Batman villain and Jim Gordon is clueless what to do. So, when an alien hunter is running amuck in your hometown what do you do? You call Batman.
The Predator may be hell strong and vicious but they made one big mistake. They chose the wrong city to go hunting in. This city belongs to the Dark Knight, the self-appointed protector of Gotham.
You know, Bruce Wayne – that perfectly sane obsessive millionaire orphan who lives in a giant mansion and dresses up as a bat at night-time – that guy. Did I mention he's also a survivalist, hand-to-hand combat expert and the world's greatest detective? I think I mentioned that part. Which is important because when the predator leaves in its wake a trail of headless corpses strung up in leftover fishnet stockings all over the show, those detective skills will come in handy.
One of the great things about Batman versus Predator is that in addition to being a cool concept, it contains dirty artwork by Andy Kubert and a satisfying story by Dave Gibbons and an introduction by master Bat-scribe Denny O' Neil. When I say dirty, the art is gritty and dark. The colouring is muddy with brown overtones that lend an seedy old fashioned crime flick feel to the comic.
Seeing the usual gaudy superhero colours in this comic would have done neither character justice. Batman is drawn so that they look suitably dark and scary. The pin-ups in the back of the collected by a who's who of comic talent are just stunning, hence why I chucked three of them in this post to enjoy.
The Predator is dark, ugly and just plain frightening, as they deal out lashings of ultra-violence. They make Batman look like a Boy Scout by comparison. The mafia goons who laughably shoot at the predator don't last too long. Neither do the police, the predator cuts them up like a hot knife through butter.
The realism in this comic I really love. What if, Batman went hand-to-hand with a Predator? Realistically what would happen? Think about that for a moment before you read on. Ask yourself, are there martial arts / combat moves that will work on any opponent regardless of size or strength? Yes? Well, would those same moves work on a 400-pound Gorilla, or how about a squid, or the mighty Kraken?
The kind of Gorilla that could literally tear off one of your limbs at their leisure, then casually throws you away like a football using just one arm? Then ask yourself what could the dark knight do in an unarmed fight against a Predator, who would be stronger than that gorilla. The answer, not a damn thing!
The result is that Batman gets their ass handed to them and barely escapes with their life in this macabre tale. What is satisfying about seeing Batman beaten to a bloody pulp, almost helpless and teetering on unconsciousness – what is satisfying is that here is a challenge worthy of the unrelenting determination of the Batman, and it's not some steroid freak conjured up for sensationalism, it is a primal beast from outer space who wants to wear Batman's skull around its waist as a fashion accessory, for the fun of it, and it doesn't care what or who it has to kill along the way. Batman is prey and nothing more, a dumb animal to be hunted for sport and leisure, at least that is what the Predator thinks. Big mistake, BIG mistake.
The predator alone is almost more than Batman can handle. But they have other problems. After investigating the string of murders by the “invisible slasher” they wind up bed-ridden temporarily blind with “deep puncture wounds, extensive lacerations, third degree burns and severe concussion.” The words of a doting Alfred. No matter how often they wrinkle their brow Alfred cannot keep Bruce Wayne in bed for long.
I won't ruin the story by giving too much away. Let's just say that not too many crime fighters could go up against the Predator and survive. Then go back to their day job of punching criminals square on the jaw while simultaneously keeping the Arkham Asylum loony bin in business. Let's just say Batman is one tough bastard and leave it at that.
I first bought the Batman vs. Predator trade book when I was a teenager about two decades ago. I loved it then, and I still love it now, and re-read it frequently. But there is nothing quite like that first time.
I didn't just read it. I DEVOURED it. I ingested it. It became part of me. I read it multiple times, sometimes fast, sometimes slowly – pausing to look at the stunning artwork and marveling at how gosh darn cool it was. Plus it was SUPER-violent, like the Predator movies, which I loved. Usually people didn't get decapitated in a Batman comic, it felt very “adult” to me.
…a bloody battle of titans, a fun and ultra-violent mini epic on the grimy streets of Gotham
It was Batman and they were fighting the Predator! Damn, that is just so cool, it's still the Batman movie I most want to see. Especially the part where they get the thrashing of a lifetime and almost dies. They go away, plans, strategises, then puts on a suit of custom Bat-armor and goes to kick the Predators ass. They nearly lose again, and in frustration grabs a baseball bat and starts wailing on the Predator, just bashing their brains in like Bobby De Niro as Al Capone in the The Untouchables. It was simple, brutal, disgusting and efficient. This high-tech animal-warrior from another planet, being beaten by a simple piece of wood and a man who just doesn't have it in them to quit, no matter the odds.
If the Predator knew who it was facing, they would have never come to earth, there was no way they could possibly win. In pure physical strength, the Predator kills Batman in a nano-second. But in genius, planning, strategy and tracking skills, the Predator is totally outmatched by the Bat. But take away the planning, gadgets, tech and resources of Batman, and you just have a guy who never gives up, their will is so strong they WILL beat you no matter what you throw at him.
Batman has beaten Superman and Darkseid, what chance does the bloody Predator have? Damn outer-space fool, crawl away home!
Of course Batman beats the Predator, and Predators being a cowardly and superstitious lot, it kills itself Japanese style with a really big sword as more Predators arrive in a spaceship. They recognise the Batman has honor, or something to that effect, then they bugger right off and take the cowards corpse with them. Then Batman gets a sleep and probably a foot rub from Alfred, or more likely stitches from their multiple wounds in the knock-down drag out slobber knocker of a battle that just took place.
It is no exaggeration to say that Batman goes through the wringer fighting the Predator, they fight multiple times throughout the four-part story collected in this trade, and it has to be up there for me with the epic battles like Undertaker vs Mankind in Hell in a Cell or Superman vs Doomsday in Death of Superman.
Rarely in the modern era do we get epic super-hero brawls, Jack Kirby did them best I think, and few people since capture that kind of dynamic explosive epic on paper. You know those fight like Thor vs Hulk or Thing vs some giant underground monster ten times their size the Moleman conjured up. The only guy who does it on a regular base in the modern era is Erik Larsen in their Savage Dragon comic, and they freely admit they do it because they love the Kirby battles.
I don't know why it is, but no matter how many times I read Batman vs Predator, it is just so damn satisfying. It should be as cheesy as Godzilla or Power Rangers or the craptacular Transformers movies that are ruining my childhood memories.
Batman vs. Predator is so obviously a marketing gimmick, the characters had no need to meet, being popular enough on their own. But man, I love epic battles. Whether it is Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris, Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, Superman vs. Doomsday, or Optimus Prime vs. Grimlock – there is just something so cool about the genuine spectacle when titans clash!
Batman vs. Predator is a very bloody comic-book. A bloody battle of titans, a fun and ultra-violent mini-epic on the grimy streets of Gotham. It's an enthralling read from beginning to end. It emulates the best qualities of a Batman comic and a Predator film. I pity the fool who doesn't get excited about that.

Bluboo are heading in to flagship territory with the Bluboo X500 Dragon. A flagship boasting specifications that rival the best of the best.
Someone at Bluboo turned around at the start of 2015 and said “no more” to generic devices, and made the decision to turn the fortunes of the company round with some well designed phones capable of disrupting the phone market.
Phones we have seen from Bluboo so far are the C100, a $99 phone with Android 5.1, LTE, 2GB RAM and HD display, and the Bluboo X550 with 5300mAh battery, Android 5.1 and 2GB RAM. With the entry-level and mid-range bases covered it is time to tackle the flagship end of the market.
The Bluboo X500 ‘Dragon' will be Bluboo's top of the range phone for 2015. These images are the first time the phone has been shown to the public and were sent to us from Bluboo along with a few specification highlights.
Bluboo tell us that they plan to release 2 models of the X500. Both phones will share the same 5-inch display and Mediatek Helio X10 chipset with the only differences (so far) being the choice of either 3GB or 4GB RAM.
Those specs would make it one of the most powerful Chinese Mediatek phones on the market with 5-inch display, a display size often overlooked by makers of flagship phones.
We've asked for more information and will post details as soon as we get them.
Joe Tacopina only lasted 11 months in charge of Bologna.
ROME -- After Rome and Bologna, Venice is the latest stop for New York lawyer Joe Tacopina in their Grand Tour of Italian soccer.
Tacopina and a group of American investors announced the purchase of the lagoon city's fourth-division soccer club Venezia FC on Friday.
The move comes less than 20 days after Tacopina resigned as president of Serie A club Bologna because of a rift with Canadian investor Joey Saputo -- having only been in charge there for 11 months.
Tacopina was also formerly on the board of directors at Roma, which in 2011 became the first foreign-owned club in Serie A.
"This is it. This is the final resting stop," Tacopina told The Associated Press by phone after posing for pictures beside Venice's Grand Canal, with gondolas in the background. "This is a big project. It's a long-term project."
The operation cost about €6 million ($6.7 million), Tacopina said.
New York sports lawyer John Goldman and finance manager John Tapinis joined Tacopina in announcing the deal.
James Daniels, the CEO of Connecticut-based High Ridge Brands, is also an investor.
"John and John are on the board," Tacopina said. "There are a couple of others who are partners but silent investors."
Venezia's last appearance in Serie A came in 2001-02. The squad's biggest title was the 1941 Italian Cup.
The club currently plays at the Pierluigi Penzo stadium on the island city. Tacopina has plans for a new 28,000-seat stadium on the mainland near the Marco Polo airport. Plans call for a basketball arena to be constructed next to the soccer stadium.
"We've already had some of the biggest stadium engineers and architects from America at the site," they said. "So it's moving along."
Venezia has had a perfect start this season with six straight wins, 18 goals scored and three conceded.
Tacopina attributed the solid start to sporting director Giorgio Perinetti, who formerly worked at Juventus, Roma and Napoli.
"He has put together a team that could compete in Serie B right now," Tacopina said.
The goal, of course, is returning to Serie A -- an accomplishment Tacopina experienced in their limited time at Bologna. But with several divisions to climb, reaching the top flight will take several promotions.
"The number of years is not the important thing," Tacopina said. "What's important is to progress every year. But with Perinetti I wouldn't bet against us."
Tacopina represented New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez in their drugs case but the lawyer said they don't currently have any high-profile cases.
That leaves more time for soccer -- or "calcio" as the sport is called in Italy.
"I spend a substantial amount of time here," Tacopina said. "For running the team I have to stay here and I will."

5 p.m. Thursday update:
U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., became a late addition to the Republican effort to repeal several key components of President Barack Obama's health care law on Thursday when they flipped their vote from ‘no' to ‘yes.'
Amodei was originally against the bill pushed by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and President Donald Trump in its first incarnation in March and remained so through several revisions as of April 28.
Republicans successfully passed the bill, known as the American Health Care Act or AHCA, moving it to the Senate where it faces a tougher road.
The flip in the vote comes after Amodei met with Vice President Mike Pence, Ryan and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price on Wednesday. Amodei said in a Thursday statement they did not think the bill would harm the state with cuts to Medicaid or alterations to insurance company's abilities to refuse or raise the cost of coverage to people with preexisting conditions.
"Accordingly, I have concluded that the potential for Nevada deficits or expanded Medicaid enrollees being kicked off of Medicaid will be avoided," they said.
House Republican leadership and Trump made several attempts to jam the legislation through Congress before the end of May before successfully doing so Thursday to use a process known as reconciliation. A reconciliation vote is able to bypass the filibuster in the Senate, requiring only 51 votes, with Pence able to cast the tiebreaker.
The latest draft of the bill to replace Obamacare includes most of the previous provisions – cutting Medicaid and ending the mandate that people purchase insurance, among others – but would also repeal one of the most popular provisions: barring companies from discriminating against patients with pre-existing conditions.
The new bill allows for companies to alter the price of customers with pre-existing conditions – anything from cancer to pregnancy. A provision was added to help offset some of the costs by including $8 billion to subsidize sick people's coverage, but analysts have said that is short of what is needed.
High-risk pools would also be promoted under the new bill, lumping already sick people into a group for insurance purposes, which Republicans say will lower the cost of insurance for healthy people. Critics say that creates a two-tier system and raises costs on people with pre-existing conditions.
Amodei originally chastised leadership for the hurried process of trying to replace Obamacare.
“The problem is there aren't any witnesses,” Amodei said before a joint session of the Nevada Legislature in March. “You know, folks who are sometimes considered shareholders? People who have views whether they're with yours or against yours.”
“How can I have a serious discussion about health care when I can't go back to any record whatsoever?” Amodei said during a later press gaggle that same day. “That's a problem for me.”
Congress hasn't held any hearings and is slated to vote Thursday without obtaining an updated report from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan entity that determines the anticipated effects of the bill. The original score from the CBO estimated 24 million people would lose health coverage by 2026.
Amodei also had initial concerns about cuts to Medicaid funding for the state that could push newly-eligible people off the rolls. A significant reduction in funding could lead to a massive budget deficit for the state Legislature to deal with.
Current law allows anyone who is earns 138 percent of the poverty line or below to enroll in the Medicaid expansion program, provided the state in which they reside accepted the expansion. Nevada was one of those states.
Even with Democrats united against the bill and several Republican holdouts, the House is likely to pass the bill on Thursday, pushing it to the Senate. However, it could face problems there from a more moderate bloc of Republican senators, including U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev.
Heller said Thursday following the House vote that they would not support the bill in its current form.
Whatever swayed Amodei also was not enough to convince Gov. Brian Sandoval that the bill would work for the state. They said in a statement Thursday their opposition to AHCA was unchanged.

U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., confirmed they were switching their vote on the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare from 'no' to 'yes' in a lengthy statement on Thursday.

For those w/ any interest in the factual foundation of my decision, please take a gander @ my statement on the #AHCAhttps://t.co/8ckhvim2qX — RepMarkAmodei (@MarkAmodeiNV2) May 4, 2017
One of Amodei's original criticisms was the hurried pace of passing the legislation. They did not address that issue in their statement.

Updated April 6, 11a.m. EST: Allure received an official statement from both Jeffree Star and Manny MUA that reads: The issue has been resolved. The Jeffree Star Cosmetics x Manny MUA collaboration will launch as planned on April 8th. We are so grateful for the continued support of our fans and are excited to share this moment with them.

It seems Jeffree Star just can't get away from controversy. According to a lawsuit filed by the McArthur Law Firm, Black Moon Cosmetics is suing Jeffree Starr Cosmetics, as well as Manny MUA, alleging copyright and trademark infringement. The offending product?: The duo's collab that they announced last month.
Black Moon Cosmetics claims that Manny MUA and Star copied its logo, which they've been using since 2015. "One of Black Moon's most successful packaging offerings, introduced in June 2015, incorporates a mark consisting of a holographic crescent moon on a black background, with 'Black Moon' embossed in holographic types near the crescent moon," the lawsuit states. Black Moon also alleges that Manny communicated with the company, "expressing a fondness" for Black Moon's logo, and then went to create a similar one for their own collection with Makeup Geek. The lawsuit states that their collaboration with Star also includes an "infringing" logo of a holographic crescent moon on a black background. An injunction request has been filed to keep Manny and Star from selling their products, plus to award damages to Black Moon.
This is Black Moon's packaging:
And here is Manny's:
Here is the Jeffree Star x Manny MUA collaboration, as well as Black Moon Cosmetics.

The lawsuit includes alleged screenshots of fan comments on both Jeffree Star Cosmetics' and Manny's Instagram accounts. They include: "Ok but why does this look like you guys just ripped off @blackmooncosmetics lmao," "Yaaas. Keep copying black moon cosmetics. Totally slaying in the creative department," and "I thought of @blackmooncosmetics when I saw the moon because it looks exactly like blackmoon's interesting." The lawyers are using the comments as proof that fans are confused by Manny and Star's packaging, thinking it could be Black Moon.
We've reached out to both Manny MUA and Jeffree Star and will update this post as more information becomes available.
Face Baking with Kandee Johnson:
The European parliament has voted for a resolution condemning Pakistan's blasphemy laws, saying that they were increasingly being used to "target vulnerable minority groups."
The resolution, which is non-binding, calls for a "thorough review of the blasphemy laws and their current application" and urged the Pakistani government to repeal the laws and abolish the death penalty. Although Pakistan does currently have prisoners on 'death row' for blasphemy convictions, there has been a virtual moratorium on executions since 2008. Nonetheless, even the allegation of blasphemy can have fatal consequences.
The resolution noted the case of Christian couple Shama Bibi and Shahbaz Masih, who were recently beaten by a mob and burnt to death, after accusations that the couple had damaged pages from a Koran.
The parliament also drew attention to the case of Asia Bibi, who was sentenced to death for blasphemy by a Pakistani court back in 2010. Bibi filed an appeal against the sentence last week, however this process "may take years," according to the resolution. The European parliament called on the President of Pakistan to issue a presidential pardon for Asia Bibi, and also urged the Pakistani Supreme Court to "start its proceedings on the case swiftly and without delay and to uphold the rule of law and full respect for human rights."
The EU parliament cited further cases of Pakistani blasphemy convictions in its resolution, including Sawan Masih, Shafqat Emmanuel and Shagufta Kausar who have all been sentenced to death.
The European Parliament's resolution urged the government to "increase efforts towards better inter-religious understanding, to actively address religious hostility by societal actors and combat religious intolerance… and acts of violence."
The resolution strongly condemned "acts of violence against religious communities, as well as all kinds of discrimination and intolerance on the grounds of religion and belief" and urged the European Commission to "use any tools at their disposal… for the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief, to aid religious communities and to pressurise the Pakistani Government to do more for the protection of religions minorities."
A Pakistani "anti-terrorism" court recently sentenced Veena Malik, Asad Bashir Khan and Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman to 26 years each in prison for blasphemy, after a "blasphemous" wedding scene, starring Veena Malik, aired on Pakistani TV.
You could be forgiven for thinking the new X edition of the TMA-1 by Aiaiai is more of the same but in actual fact at $120 the X edition is a much more modern sounding headphone than the older TMA-1 and displays a high degree of flexibility that might just feel like a more attractive option to the “pick up and go” headphone wearing igadget generation.
Aiaiai had a stab at this before with the Capital but it didn't have quite the same impact and complaints about the impossible seal and disjointed sound kept the Capital forever lurking in the TMA-1 shadow. Bringing the look and name down to this price point feels more likely to succeed and certainly the X edition, from afar, looks like the twin of the TMA-1.
So are we getting a good deal or a budget TMA-1?

Does this mean Linux distributions can now support Secure Boot?
Is the Linux Foundation the preferred loader for distributions?
Why use it at all, then?
Any other reasons?
Why doesn't Shim do the same?
Can't you try both approaches?
Which should I use?
The UEFI bootloader that the Linux Foundation have been working on has just been released . That means we now have two signed bootloaders available - this one and shim They've actually been able to for a while. Ubuntu shipped with Secure Boot support last October, and Fedora shipped with Secure Boot support in January. Both used Shim rather than the Linux Foundation loader, and Shim's also being used by a variety of smaller distributions. The LF loader is a different solution to the same problem.Probably not in most cases. One of the primary functional differences between Shim and the LF loader is that the LF loader is based around cryptographic hashes rather than signing keys. This means that the user has to explicitly add a hash to the list of permitted binaries whenever a distribution updates their bootloader or kernel. Doing that involves being physically present at the machine, so it's kind of a pain.Being hash based means that you don't need to maintain any signing infrastructure. This means that distributions can support Secure Boot without having to change their build process at all. Shim already supports this use case (and some distributions are using it), but the LF loader has nicer UI for managing it.Actually, yes. Shim implements Secure Boot loading in a less than entirely ideal way - it duplicates the firmware's entire binary loading, validation, relocation and execution code. This is necessary because the UEFI specification doesn't provide any mechanism for adding additional authentication mechanisms. The main downside of this is that the standard UEFI LoadImage() and StartImage() calls don't work under Shim. The LF loader hooks into the low-level security architecture and installs its own handlers, which means the standard UEFI interfaces work. The upshot is that you can use bootloaders like Gummiboot or efilinux without having to modify them to call out to Shim.The UEFI architecture is slightly complicated. The UEFI specification itself defines the upper layers of the firmware, basically covering everything that UEFI applications and operating systems need. It doesn't define the lower layers of a UEFI implementation. Those are contained in the UEFI Platform Initialization spec, and that's what defines the security architecture interfaces that the LF loader hooks into. The problem is that it's completely valid to implement the UEFI specification without implementing the Platform Initialization specification, and if anyone does that then the LF loader will fail.Yes, and that's actually pretty much the plan now. I'm working on integrating the LF loader's UI and security code into Shim with the aim of producing one loader that'll satisfy the full set of use cases, and James is happy with this Depends. If you want to support gummiboot (and aren't willing to patch it to call out to Shim), you'll need to use the LF loader. If you want to use key-based signing setups to avoid forcing re-enrolment on updates, you'll need to use Shim. If you're somewhere in the middle, you can probably use either. Once we've got the code merged, you won't have to make a choice.
Image caption The UN's peacekeeping mission has been in DR Congo for more than a decade
The UN has appointed a Brazilian general credited with bringing a Haiti slum under control to lead peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Gen Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz will lead 20,000 troops, including a new combat force charged with targeting rebels in the east of the country.
This is the most offensive mandate given to any UN peacekeeping force.
Gen Santos Cruz told the BBC their troops would be trained to consider civilians and private property in DR Congo.
"The most critical area is nowadays the eastern part of the country," they told the BBC's Newsday programme.
"I am ready to face the most difficult of scenarios. The main objective is to relieve the suffering of the people."
Gen Santos Cruz will be in charge of a new 2,500-strong brigade tasked with "neutralising and disarming" armed groups which have ravaged eastern DR Congo for the past two decades.
The most recent uprising, by the M23 rebels, began in 2012 and has led some 800,000 people to flee their homes in the mineral-rich region.
Both neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda have denied UN charges that they are supporting the M23.
The UN peacekeeping force in DR Congo, known as Monusco, has been widely criticised as ineffective.
Troops from Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa are likely to form the bulk of the new brigade, which is expected to be deployed by July.
Gen Santos Cruz is a retired former force commander of the Haiti mission, and is credited with dismantling criminal gangs in Haiti in 2007.
UN peacekeeping forces battled for more than a year to regain control of the large Cite Soleil slum in Port au Prince from the gangs.
A few weeks ago on the Ting Facebook page, we shared one of our weekly discussion posts and received some great comments from our Facebook fans. One of our customers, Ryan, responded to the post and was randomly selected as a lucky winner of a $25 Ting service credit. (If you'd like the chance to win some credit and/or Ting swag every week, Like us on Facebook.)
After adding $25 to their account, we noticed Ryan had been a Ting customer for over two years and had racked up a ton of referral credit since making the switch. As a veteran user, we asked Ryan if they would be interested in chatting with us about their experience with Ting, to help those who may be apprehensive about leaving a well-known provider for a low-cost cell phone carrier like Ting.
Fortunately, they were happy to speak with us! Ryan was eager to share their story, from their initial reasons for leaving AT&T to their current thoughts about Ting mobile service and more.
How did you originally find out about Ting?
My wife and I were in the market for new phones and wanted to switch from AT&T. We didn't like how the cost of new phones would be calculated into our monthly bill, because we were planning to keep our new phones for a long time and didn't want to keep paying for the same devices long after they should have been paid off. Of course we could get new phones every two years, but that felt wasteful to us, and didn't address our goal of saving money. On top of that, we weren't happy with AT&T's pricing model. We were paying for minutes we never used, but if we went over on data or texts, we got hit with overage fees. We were essentially overpaying whether we used our phones too much or not enough – how lame is that?
So after Googling around, we found Ting and decided to take the plunge.
How many devices do you have on your account, and what type of smartphones do you use?
We have two Nexus 5s. Both have needed repairs (hers for water damage, mine for a busted power button), but they're still great phones.
How much have you saved on average per month since switching to Ting?
Our average AT&T bill was roughly $120 per month, and that's with a discount I got through my work! With Ting, it's always about $50 per month, not including any extra credits. So that's a $70 savings every month.
Did your usage patterns change since switching? Why or why not?
Yeah, if anything, we use our phones more! We aren't worried about overage charges anymore, so we stopped closely monitoring our data and texting habits. I remember setting up little reminders on my phone to tell me when I was approaching my data limit – glad that's all over with.
“My Ting bill is dependent on my actual usage, not some arbitrary plan I picked when signing up.”
What's your favorite thing about Ting?
The customer service is really great, like actually refreshingly great. I don't think I've ever called Ting without being surprised and impressed with whomever I spoke with. Not only do they really know their stuff, but talking with them feels like just a normal, genuine conversation instead of a scripted song and dance.
Do you use any “Ting hacks” or phone tricks to help lower your phone bill? (ex: Google Hangouts for free Wi-Fi calling, data compression apps, etc)
Ha! No more cost-saving phone tricks for me — fixing the service was the big one. But now that I think about it, I have downloaded offline maps to my phone so I'm not burning through data as I navigate. I'm sure that's saved me a few bucks here and there. [Relevant Ting tip.]
We've noticed you've referred over 20 people to Ting. Can you tell us more about that? What do you say to people to help convince them to switch to Ting?
After we switched to Ting, I posted a review of my experience in an online forum and answered a few questions from visitors. It got much more attention than I thought it would, so I'm pretty happy I included my referral code!
I think a lot of people have assumptions about phone companies they expect will carry over to Ting. They've already had service with one or two major carriers and think Ting will be pretty much like that, with maybe a few cost-saving measures baked in. They think, “Am I willing to downgrade to save money?” But Ting isn't a major carrier, so the experience is entirely different. My Ting bill is dependent on my actual usage, not some arbitrary plan I picked when signing up. Overages don't really exist with Ting; neither do activation fees. There are also no early termination fees, because there are no contracts. There are no mall kiosks, no nationwide television ads, no corporate-branded sports arenas — all that stuff costs money that you, the Ting customer, don't pay for anymore. It's just simpler, and I like that. And I think being smaller makes for a better customer experience, too.
As a second part to that question, how long has your Ting referral credit paid your bill for?!
I just did the math, and Ting's referral credits have paid for about 13 months of phone bills! To put that in perspective, if I were still with AT&T, 13 months of bills would have cost me over $1,500. All in all, I've saved over $2,600 since making the switch. Thanks Ting!!

Anything else you'd like to say?
Just one more thing: I am a real live person. I agreed to this interview because I actually like my phone company. Not just the service they provide, or the price they provide it at, but the actual company—their mission, their approach—and the people I've interacted with. And I like being able to say that.
(Full disclosure, though, I'm also being sent a sweet Ting t-shirt.)

Why Simplicity Matters in Web Development as it does in life.
ArchieAtOrigins Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 25, 2016
I am not as young as I once was, but I am much wiser than I have ever been. Due to the vicissitudes that life visited upon me from 2008 to 2012, I have reinvented my life. Life 2.o if you'll indulge me.
This time around I vowed to do what I enjoyed making my living. After all, if decades of work can be wiped away so quickly due to the obscene greed of the demagogues and plutocrats, you may as well enjoy the ride. Old wisdom that's taken me a lifetime to truly understand and internalize.
Any newbie will be happy to rage on about the overwhelming wave of potential paths of learning you face when you decide to become a developer. It seems simple at first. Html, CSS. Very learnable. Achievable. Maybe I can learn these, make a small living, and enjoy my days doing it. But before you master these you realize that the market wants you to know a little more. PHP. Javascript. So you begin to explore these. Your bookmarks and your bookshelves get a little more bloated with links and tomes. And it doesn't stop. Soon you are coming across words like framesworks, Bootstrap, Foundations, and _underscore. So you try to understand what these are, how they fit in and whether you need to know them. But before you even understand what they mean, more words crop up. Angular, React, Ajax, APIs. C# and C++. Version control, Git, and Github. WAMP and MAMP. Atom and Sublime Text. And they keep coming, and coming, until you think your head will explode and you are considering a job as a commercial truck driver.
Here is the solution. Have you ever heard the expression, “inch deep, mile wide?” Or one of my mother's favorites, “Jack of all trades, master of none.” These phrases aren't used to describe a favorable situation. Your goal is the opposite. Simplicity.
I have never been as happy as I have become since I learned to embrace a more simplified life. I had to learn many lessons before I finally understood why and how to do this. It was years before “the dime dropped.” It took many years and lessons before I really realized that once I had relative safety, food, and shelter, that no amount of money would bring me additional happiness. Perhaps temporary pleasure, but not lasting happiness. That comes from another place (which maybe I'll talk about at another time.)
So the answer is simplicity. Pick something. Master it. Build on it. Ignore all the additional detritus. If it has true value, it will still be there when it is time to learn it. In truth, I suspect much of it will be replaced, and you will have saved yourself a great deal of time learning something that was due to become obsolete anyway.
A minor addendum to those of you who are saying “but I have to learn it NOW! I need to earn a living.” You will. Have you ever seen someone standing on the street, holding out their hat with one hand, and smoking a tailor made cigarette with the other? You'll manage. And trying to master 10 things at once won't get you there faster.
The only difference between a professional writer and a drunk texter is the ability to edit. Some writers follow the simple process of “Pre-write, write, rewrite” and they seem to do alright. Some of us are a touch too critical for our own good and end up dropping a tonne of usable content in search of perfection. At some point during re-editing (it's about all we do) we realize that we should not have edited out some word or phrase, which we are unable to recall. There are built in revision tools in most word processors that let you track your text history. Microsoft Word lets you track changes alongside your document, Mac has a native version history with each file, so on and so forth. Now, we have a solution that lets you write in your favourite editor but track changes separately. Draft Control lets you track, search, archive and restore edits as you please. There is a $19.99 in-app purchase that lets you access multiple documents simultaneously, the free version lets you edit only one.
The app features a very simple interface, nary a seam in sight. Simply drag your document into Draft Control and it will start tracking the document. You may continue working on your document as you normally would, meanwhile Draft Control will update the document at regular intervals, or any time you press save. You will be notified each time.
In a selected document, any additional text is colored green, any deleted text turns red, with an arrow pointing to what the text became. When editing, it makes it easy to scan through the document quickly to track any changes. You can even check a preview of what your file looks like without the edits
The document used for a test was a markdown file, edited using WriterPro (easier to adapt).The following formats are supported, with support for .mellel having recently been added:
Microsoft Word (.docx) Pages (.pages) LibreOffice, OpenOffice (.odt) Scrivener (.scriv) Mellel (.mellel) Markdown (.md) Rich Text (.rtf) All plain text formats (.txt, .tex, .html, .fountain, etc.)
The Draft Control app has its share of downsides. If you are working on a large file and realize you need a few sentences from a previous draft, you will have to make that change manually, as this is strictly a tracking app. There are additional controls that can be accessed through the menu bar, but there isn't much explanation provided on how to best put them to use. All in all, either you will absolutely need this app, or not at all. There isn't much of a middle ground, though definitely recommended for a test run.

Netflix: Kevin Spacey Will No Longer Appear On 'House Of Cards' If Show Returns
Netflix said Friday night that Kevin Spacey will no longer be a part of “House of Cards” and it's cutting all other ties with the actor after a series of allegations of sexual harassment and assault.
“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards' that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement.
Netflix said it will work with the show's production company MRC to evaluate whether it will continue without him.
Spacey was nominated for best drama actor Emmy Awards during each of the show's first five seasons, but never won. They played a ruthless politician who ascends to the presidency of the United States. Co-star Robin Wright is also a central player on the show, and it could conceivably continue with a focus on them
Production on the show had already been suspended on Tuesday. The show employs hundreds of Marylanders on its cast and crew and contracts with hundreds of area vendors, according to the Maryland Film Office.
Netflix says it also will refuse to release the film “Gore,” in which Spacey stars as the writer Gore Vidal and also acted as producer.
CNN reported that eight current or former “House of Cards” workers claim that Spacey made the production a “toxic” workplace and one ex-employee alleges the actor sexually assaulted him.
Spacey has not been arrested or charged with any crime. In Harford County, where the production is based, authorities said Friday they have received no complaints related to Spacey's behavior, and therefore had not investigated the actor's conduct in their time on the show.
Their publicist did not immediately return an email message late Friday night seeking comment. A publicist said earlier this week that Spacey is “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.”
The Academy Award-winning actor became ensnared in Hollywood's fast-growing sexual harassment crisis after actor Anthony Rapp alleged Spacey made sexual advances toward them in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Spacey has said they don't remember the alleged encounter reported by BuzzFeed News last weekend but apologized if such “drunken behavior” occurred.
The story spurred several others to come forward with similar allegations about Spacey.
London police are reportedly investigating Spacey for a 2008 sexual assault, British media reported Friday.
Police did not identify Spacey by name but said the department's child abuse and sexual offenses unit is investigating the reported assault after it was referred to police earlier this week.
Also Friday, Hamilton Fish, publisher of The New Republic, resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment.
In a company memo shared with The Associated Press, magazine owner Win McCormack wrote that Fish's resignation was effective immediately and that an internal investigation would continue. Fish, who joined The New Republic in 2016, had been placed on leave of absence last week.  They are a former publisher of The Nation.
“As I understand it, some employees, to my deep dismay, complained this week that my presence had led them to feel uncomfortable at The New Republic,” Fish wrote to McCormack in a memo Friday that was also shared with the AP. “Women have longstanding and profound concerns with respect to their treatment in the workplace. Many men have a lot to learn in this regard. I know I do, and I hope for and encourage that new direction.”
Fish wrote in an email to the AP that they “felt the controversy swirling around us could cause irreparable harm to the magazine, and that the only way to protect The New Republic and its employees was for me to separate from the organization.” Noting their time with such organizations as The Nation, a prominent liberal publication, and with Human Rights Watch, they wrote that they had spent their career in “in progressive media and the human rights field.
Fish and Spacey are among a wave of celebrities and media figures stepping down or being fired since reports in October of alleged harassment and assault by Harvey Weinstein. Others departing include author and former NBC analyst Mark Halperin, former New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier and former NPR chief editor Michael Oreskes, who was an AP executive from 2008 to 2015.
Seattle is on track to become the first place in the country where heroin addicts can legally shoot up at a supervised healthcare facility, hoping that the controversial move can reduce the number of overdose deaths and decrease the spread of disease through dirty needles.
An outgrowth of needle exchange programs found throughout the U.S., the two "supervised injection facilities" would assign drug users to a small cubicle where they could shoot up. Medical personnel monitor each person's response to the drug and, if they or they overdose, is immediately treated with an overdose-reversing medication such as naloxone.
The facilities are intended to bring users out from the alleys and into safe places where overdoses can be treated immediately and addicts can be encouraged to get into a treatment program. Ninety-one people a day die in the U.S. from an opioid overdose, including heroin and painkillers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Seattle's home of King County, that included 229 deaths in 2015.
Although the concept is new to the U.S., more than 90 such facilities exist in Europe, Australia and Canada. The Vancouver, British Columbia, facility saves between 1.9 and 11.7 lives annually by using drugs that reverse overdoses, according to a report.
Seattle created a 40-member task force last year to develop strategies for thwarting the drug problem. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and King County Executive Dow Constantine announced in late January that they were looking at where to create the facilities and what it would take to build them.
The Seattle-King County Public Health Department is looking into funding the two projects, but one state senator is hoping to block the endeavor before money is allocated.
Republican state Sen. Mark Miloscia proposed a bill to ban secure injection zones in Washington, and the bill is sitting in committee in the Senate.
"Toleration is not compassionate, it is a signal of defeat. We cannot give up on drug users. In the end, these sites will only distract us from getting resources into real, medically proven treatment options," Miloscia said.
John P. Walters, director of drug control policy in George W. Bush's administration, agreed the only safe approach to heroin is not to take it.
"Supporting addicts' heroin use maintains their disease, administering the poison that causes their illness and diminishes their lives. A government-approved place for unlimited heroin injection creates the conditions for never-ending addiction and gives government a drug dealer's power over the addicted," Walters wrote in an op-ed. "We do not protect addicts by reviving them from overdose death only to return them to death's front door, perpetuating the self-destructive cycle of addiction."
Advocates argue that the safe spots not only would cut down on the number of deaths, but also would dramatically cut down the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C.
Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, said not taking action to reduce the spread of those diseases would be irresponsible from a public health perspective. Cutting even one HIV infection would save $379,668 in lifetime costs, according to NIDA data.
King County spends $1.2 million annually on its needle exchange program, allowing the program to essentially pay for itself if three infections are prevented per year. Cutting infections by 1 percent in King County would save more than $70 million in HIV-related medical costs, the county's website states.
San Francisco and Massachusetts officials also are studying the pros and cons of safe injection clinics. San Francisco commissioned a study that found one facility would prevent 3.3 cases of HIV and 19 cases of hepatitis C per year and bring 110 people to enter medication-assisted treatment.
A San Francisco facility is estimated to cost $2.6 million per year, but when adding in the $6.1 million savings in healthcare costs, the city believes it would save $3.5 million annually.
OAKLAND, Maine — Numerous law enforcement officials began canvassing a wooded area in Oakland early Wednesday morning in an effort to locate missing toddler Ayla Reynolds.
Department of Public Safety spokesperson Stephen McCausland said Wednesday in a news release that more than 30 personnel from Oakland police, Maine State Police, four canine teams, state police divers and game wardens are participating in the search.
Search efforts are being focused on an area off Hussey Hill Road, McCausland said. They would not go into further detail about the cause of the search. A warden told the BDN late Wednesday morning that searchers are focusing on both sides of Hussey Hill Road.
“I'm not going to give any specifics,” said McCausland by phone Wednesday morning. “I was very clear as to what we were doing in the press release and I will get into additional details at [a scheduled 1:30 p.m. media briefing].”
A combination of woods and a small pond will be searched throughout the day, McCausland said.
The entrance to the search area Wednesday is cordoned off with police tape. A mobile command vehicle for the warden service and other vehicles were parked on Nike Lane. One Oakland police officer on the scene said they could not comment about the search.
The area is the planned location for Ridgewoods Estates. It was cleared within the last few years to make way for the development.
Paul Stevens, who lives in the area, said game wardens arrived at about 6:30 a.m.
“I've been hunting and snowshoeing out there before,” they said. “It's all just trees, there's not much out there until Zachary Drive. They must figure something is out there. I just hope they find her.”
Reynolds has been the subject of a police investigation for nearly two years since they were reported missing by their father, Justin DiPietro, on Dec. 17, 2011. DiPietro told police that Ayla had gone missing overnight from their Violette Avenue home in Waterville. Within days, investigators said they had ruled out that Ayla had been abducted by a stranger and in subsequent months, sought to pressure DiPietro and two other adults, DiPietro's sister and girlfriend, who were in the home on the dates in question.
Police first said that they had found Ayla's blood in DiPietro's home and later that they were convinced DiPietro and the others hadn't told them the truth about what had happened to the missing toddler.
No one has been charged in connection with the toddler's disappearance and investigators have said repeatedly that they have ruled no one out as a suspect. At an emotional scene outside a courthouse in Portland last month, Trista Reynolds, who is Ayla's mother, confronted DiPietro and their mother, Phoebe DiPietro, about the missing girl. Reynolds and Phoebe DiPietro accused each other of knowing what happened to Ayla; Justin DiPietro refused to speak.
Wednesday's search in Oakland is the latest of numerous searches conducted by police, wardens and dive teams in and around Waterville, though investigators have been quiet about the case for several months.
McCausland originally announced that authorities would brief the public and media at 3 p.m., but later Wednesday morning changed the time to 1:30 p.m.

Following the recent promotion of Activision CFO Thomas Tippl to COO, reports have emerged of a significant company reorganization that sees Activision Blizzard split into four primary business units.The four primary units are centered around the Infinity Ward-createdfranchise, other internal properties likeand, licensed properties owned by external parties, and Blizzard Entertainment, the last of which has effectively operated as an autonomous business unit since Activision's merger with Vivendi.News of the company's new structure comes by way of internal memos obtained by The Los Angeles Times . Activision representatives reportedly confirmed the news.Activision has not yet announced the changes to the public or its shareholders, but may do so officially in its next round of quarterly financial statements.Still, the company offered a recent clue as to its intentions when it detailed the new Call of Duty division being headed up by Philip Earl, announced soon after the ousting of Infinity Ward heads Jason West and Vince Zampella According to the Times' reporting, the new licensed games unit will be led by Dave Oxford, current head of Minneapolis-based Activision Value. The internal property group, which includesand, will be headed up by owned properties EVP Maria Stipp.Blizzard will continue under the leadership of current president Mike Morhaime, who reports to Tippl under their new roles.In 2007, major competitor Electronic Arts announced a similar plan, splitting its publishing operations into four labels : EA Games, EA Sports, The Sims, and EA Casual.
FANTASY BASEBALL, BELTWAY STYLE
In a campaign season with lots of surprises, how's this for a wild prediction? It would never happen, of course, but pull up a chair and indulge me.
My premise is, President Obama hates Hillary Clinton and always has. Why?
(1) Because everyone hates Hillary;
(2) Obama has special reasons for hating them based on the things they have done and said;
(3) Their senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, also hates Hillary, so, if by some accident, Obama wakes up one day not hating Hillary, Jarrett is there to say, Oh yes you do!
(4) Obama adores their vice president, Joe Biden;
(5) They know that Hillary can't beat Trump.
Obama must be having withdrawal symptoms as their second term draws to a close. If they were Reagan, he'd just want to go home and chop wood. But he's not Reagan. The most powerful man in the universe is about to become just some schmuck in an airport. And he's got Valerie Jarrett chirping in their ear, You need to protect your legacy!
Who more perfectly encapsulates white privilege than Hillary Clinton? Hers was a charmed political life. They rose to political power in the draft of their husband, was given infinite breaks, then ruthlessly fought Obama for the nomination, long after it was clear they were not the Democrats' choice in 2008.
Obama resented their campaign and resented Bill Clinton's not-so-coded racism.
While the rest of the world assumes Hillary used a private server as secretary of state to hide their emails from the media or congressional investigators, Obama and Jarrett know that the private server was to prevent them from finding out what they were up to.
There was always the sneaking suspicion that Hillary was keeping their powder dry to challenge Obama in 2012, as Teddy Kennedy had challenged President Carter. On this theory, it wasn't FOIA requests Hillary was worried about, but the prying eyes of Valerie Jarrett.
By all accounts, Americans want a more transparent food system. Recent polling suggests the majority of Americans favor labeling that tells them exactly how and where their food is produced. And yet, several bills are currently moving through Congress that could make it much harder to learn about the source of our food.
These bills would prevent state and local governments from requiring labeling of GMOs; remove country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements for most of the meat we buy; and make it harder to know where pesticides are used. The international trade agreements now being negotiated also include provisions that could make such information less available to consumers.
The food industry is spending an enormous amount of money to promote and lobby for this legislation. Food companies may have shelled out over $100 million* in the first six months of 2015 alone, according to federal lobbying disclosure reports.
Businesses and trade groups promoting these policies say putting more information on food labels will send the wrong message about food safety, add costs, and pose barriers to trade. And in some cases, they worry it will open U.S. food producers and other companies to punitive import-export taxes.
But good food advocates disagree. “This is basic transparency,” says Patty Lovera, assistant director of the advocacy group Food & Water Watch. “We're not saying anything's unsafe,” says Environmental Working Group (EWG) policy analyst Libby Foley. “We're saying it's about consumer choice.”
Here are the numbers the food industry doesn't want you to see:
GMO Labeling
So far this year, food and beverage companies have spent $51.6 million on a series of lobbying efforts to defeat GMO labeling laws such as the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015 (H.R. 1599), which opponents have dubbed the “Deny Americans the Right to Know” or DARK Act. According to a recent analysis by EWG, nearly a quarter of this money—$12.6 million—comes from just six companies: Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg's, Land O'Lakes, and PepsiCo.
Other big spenders in these efforts include the Grocery Manufacturers Association ($5.1 million); American Farm Bureau (nearly $1 million); and the National Restaurant Association ($2 million). Many state farm bureaus have also chipped in—among them, Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, and Oregon. Big name food producers, including Campbell Soup, Mars, Inc., Mondelez, Nestlé, OceanSpray, Safeway, and Unilever, are all spending significant amounts money on this issue as well.
In addition to direct lobbying of members of the House, Senate, and other federal policy-makers, some of the groups lobbying for H.R. 1599 have come together as the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food, running a consumer-oriented website, as well as television ads and a social media campaign. And the money tallied by EWG was spent specifically on federal lobbying so it doesn't include the millions spent last fall to defeat state GMO labeling measures—like those in Colorado and Oregon or on the ongoing legal challenge to the GMO-labeling bill passed in Vermont.
H.R. 1599 passed the House on in July. No companion bill has yet been introduced in the Senate.
An additional $4.1 million has been spent so far this year by companies to promote genetically engineered salmon, with most of this coming from the Biotechnology Industry Organization, which is also supporting H.R. 1599. There's also plenty of lobbying going on to keep GE salmon out of Pacific coast waters, where salmon fishing is big business.
Meat Labeling
Many of the same companies and organizations spending heavily to block GMO labeling requirements have also been lobbying to repeal existing country of origin labeling (COOL) requirements for beef, chicken, and pork through the Country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015 (H.R. 2393).
Among them are the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Campbell Soup, Cargill, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kraft Foods, PepsiCo, and Unilever. They are joined by others in the meat business, including Tyson Foods, Smithfield, Hormel, the National Pork Producers Association, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, as well as Walmart and the big-spending U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Together, the supporters of this bill have spent at least $54.2 million.*
Those spending money to repeal COOL argue that labeling meat with the country of origin would increase costs for producers and therefore for consumers—with the threat that tariffs could be levied against U.S. producers if the labeling is found in violations of World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions.
Canada and Mexico have argued that COOL labels hurt sales of their meat by signaling to U.S. consumers that the product is somehow less safe or desirable. While the Obama administration is defending the existing policy, meat and other food producers fear that if Canada and Mexico prevail, those countries would impose costly tariffs that would harm U.S. exports. H.R. 2393 passed the house in June, but its companion Senate bill, S. 1844 has not yet had a committee hearing.
And a heads-up: Provisions in the TTP and TTIP could facilitate similar policies to those of the WTO—making it possible, not only for countries but also individual companies to file objections to labeling if it harms trade.
Pesticides
Yet another bill that would curtail access to agricultural information is the Sensible Environmental Protection Act of 2015 (S. 1500). It would eliminate permits now required to discharge pesticides into rivers, lakes, streams, and other bodies of water regulated under the Clean Water Act.
CropLife America—a trade association for agri-chemical producers and users—explains that the bill is designed to reverse a 2009 federal court decision that directed the EPA to require permits from pesticide applicators who spray over “navigable waters.” Senator Barbara Boxer (D-California) has called S.1500 “a far-reaching bill that is dangerous to people” that would “would allow pesticides to be sprayed where kids are swimming, which would expose them to substances that are known to be toxic.”
Pesticide Action Network (PAN) says the bill would remove the EPA's ability to monitor and take action on waterways contaminated by pesticides. This, said PAN spokesperson Paul Towers, would leave both the EPA and the public “in the dark” and put “the health of waterways and public health in jeopardy.”
Because the bill was just introduced in June, a good accounting of lobbying on its behalf is not yet available through Congressional disclosure filings. But when virtually the same bill was introduced in 2013, it garnered support from agribusinesses and agricultural organizations and trade associations including the American Farm Bureau, CropLife America, Agricultural Retailers Association, Missouri Farm Bureau, Monsanto, North Carolina Farm Bureau, National Council of Farmer Co-ops, and the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association. These groups spent more than $11 million lobbying for the bill during 2013 and 2014.
The fate of all these bills is uncertain given the limited time before Congress adjourns for the year. But given how contentious these issues have become—and what food producers and agribusinesses perceive as high financial stakes—it's unlikely that they will disappear.
One note of optimism for transparency-in-food-production advocates, but disappointment for Idaho dairy groups, is the ruling earlier this month by the U.S. District Court in Idaho striking down the state's so-called “ag-gag” law—formally the “Agricultural Security Act” that made illegal undercover documentation of farming operations. Citing First Amendment free speech protections, Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled the bill unconstitutional.
So where does this leave consumers? Right now, the only way to be sure the food you buy doesn't contain genetically engineered foods is to seek out the USDA's certified organic and Non-GMO Project‘s GMO-free label. As for meat and fish—if it is not cooked or prepared before it reaches store shelves, its country of origin is probably still labeled. But that could change. And if the new trade agreements go into effect, these and other labeling provisions could be open to challenge.
Meanwhile a sizable fortune is being spent trying to keep this information off food labels. “This has turned into a bigger fight than either side anticipated,” says EWG's Foley. And that may be one point on which both sides can agree.
*This estimate is based on lobbying expenditures listed on disclosure forms filed with the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Secretary of the U.S. Senate and compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. It is only a partial accounting as this represents spending by 20 of the approximately 100 members of the COOL Reform Coalition that signed a June 8 letter to Congress voicing support for H.R. 2393. This is the same source—and method—that EWG used to estimate spending to oppose GMO labeling bills.
* Because of the limitations of the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the numbers in this post are all estimates.
“God bless them” – Nancy Pelosi
TAMPA (FOX 13) – Tampa police say they've confiscated bricks and pipes from a rooftop in Tampa, and discovered what they say is “anarchist” graffiti.
The anonymous symbol was spray painted, along with the number “99” in red paint.
All of it was found on top of a building at 1000 North Florida Ave., which is at the corner of Florida Avenue and Tyler Street.
“We are appreciative that the business owner called us,” Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor said Tuesday afternoon.
“Finding those items for us was not a surprise,” they added. “We are just pleased to see the communications process worked the way it did.”
Bill Warner is a private investigator who tracks and researches radical groups all over the world. They say the stockpile is a sign of trouble ahead.
“These are tactics terrorists use in the Middle East. They will hide bricks in piles in buildings and so forth. They will move into the area start their little protests. Then they will find their pile of bricks and pipes and start busting out windows,” Warner said.
Castor said what's most important is making sure none of the items is used to harm anyone during the RNC.
For months, FOX 13 has been reporting about the Black Bloc, an anarchist group that causes chaos and havoc around the world. The FBI has labeled them domestic terrorists who are against government, corporate America, and law enforcement.
Nimble Sense brings your hands into VR without gloves
The proliferation of virtual reality headsets, especially consumer-friendly ones, has given rise to the next logical interest in VR development: our hands. After all, the VR illusion is broken when you have to resort to game controllers or even tapping to do some actions. Thus, many are now trying to add our hands into the equation, letting us control and manipulate the VR world as naturally as we see it. Nimble Sense is just one of the latest to attempt that, but it isn't using any gloves to do so.
Once you read about the technology behind the Nimble Sense, it all makes, well, sense. It uses an infrared laser and camera duo to capture a 3D point cloud of the real world in a wide 110-degree angle, pretty much the same line of thinking behind the Microsoft Kinect. Of course, you wouldn't want to wear a Kinect on your head, so Nimble VR, the aptly named group behind this Kickstarter project, has shrunk it down so that it could actually be mounted on top of a VR headset, in particular an Oculus Rift. In theory, you can use it on other head-mounted displays. Heck, in theory you can even use it on a desktop for other purposes.
But hardware is only half the story and what Nimble VR is also bragging about is its software, a skeletal hand tracking system that delivers low-latency and high-accuracy, just the two words you'd want to hear when it comes to VR and interactive content, like games. Naturally, Nimble Sense comes with an API that developers can hook into to create games, virtual reality worlds, or even hand-controlled applications. The software itself isn't open source but the examples provided by Nimble VR are, just to help jumpstart developers' creative juices.
“VR Hands” experiments are usually separated into two camps: those with gloves and those without. Nimble Sense obviously falls in one camp. But while it can boast of the convenience of not having awkward and sometimes uncomfortable gloves, it does lose out on some aspects, like the tactile feedback that contraptions like Dexmo offers. For now, it's a necessary trade off that we'll just have to accept given the level of technology and materials we currently posses.
One other thing that Nimble Sense prides itself in is in price. Of course, being just a bar plus a USB cable and a headset mount, it's not surprising that it would only be asking for $99 at the very least. “Asking”, you ask? Yes, Nimble Sense is, unfortunately, still one of the many Kickstarter campaigns vying for your attention and your money. That said, it has managed to surpass its $65,000 goal with 39 days to spare, proving that it has believers willing to put their money to work for their beliefs. Whether it will be able to deliver the finished producct, and on time, is a completely different story.

ACTA Supporters In Europe Fighting To The Bitter End
from the what-a-cliffhanger dept
As Techdirt has reported over the last few months, the passage of ACTA through the European Union's approval process has been little short of extraordinary. At the end of last year, ACTA seemed almost certain to be approved without difficulty. Then, inspired by the Internet community's success in stopping SOPA, European citizens woke up to ACTA's problems and took to the streets in huge numbers.
The first ACTA rapporteur resigned, and the second later came out firmly against ACTA. The main European political parties announced their opposition to ACTA, except for the largest, the EPP Group. More recently, five out of five European Parliament committees recommended that the European Parliament should reject ACTA in the plenary vote on ratification.
That final vote is scheduled to take place this Wednesday, and the surprises keep on coming. First, we had a rumour that the right-of-centre EPP Group would ask for a secret vote, but that never happened. Then today we heard that the EPP Group would be asking for a postponement of the ACTA vote until after the European Court of Justice has given its verdict on the compatibility of ACTA with the European Union's treaties. That decision probably won't be handed down for a year or two, so this was plainly a delaying tactic. It was believed that the call for postponement would come at the meeting setting the agenda for the coming week, but once more nothing happened.
And then, unexpectedly, the the EPP Group posted the following message on its Twitter account: #EPP‬ will ask during tomorrow's debate on ‪#ACTA‬ for a postponement of the vote until we have ECJ's ruling. It's not entirely clearly under what procedure the EPP Group will do this, although Jérémie Zimmermann from La Quadrature du Net suggested it might be under Rule 177 : Adjournment of a debate and vote, of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
However, there are also some rumors that the EPP Group is divided over whether it should attempt to postpone the vote – understandably, since it would be a huge slap in the face of the European electorate if this procedural trick were used to put off a decision on ACTA for a year or two. So, it's still not really clear what will happen tomorrow once the plenary session of the European Parliament begins. Or rather, one thing is clear: that the ACTA battle is by no means over, and that the EPP Group is fighting desperately to stave off defeat in the final vote on Wednesday.

Homelessness came to the forefront locally two years ago when members of Occupy Eugene put the issue at the top of their list of concerns. Since then, advocates have continued to press for safe places for people to sleep. The new "Opportunity Village" is a pilot program aimed at giving people a second chance. Its grand opening is Saturday (October 5, 2013.)
Story about new transitional housing for homeless in Eugene.
Nestled between small neighborhoods and industrial parks on Garfield Street, there is a new "gated" community. A man with a clipboard greets visitors to Opportunity Village. To enter, one must be escorted by a resident. No drop-in's or minors allowed. Currently, the Village is made up of seven mini-Conestoga huts and eight bungalows measuring 8 x 8 or 8 x 10.
Torrey: "Please go right in."
Reporter: "Thank you."
52 year old Mike Torrey and their wife live in Bungalow number 12.
Torrey: "Our little DVD player and coffee maker. I built a couple of shelves. So basically, it's just like a little house about the size of somebody's bedroom. But it's very functional for us. And we really do like it here."
Torrey and their wife had been living on the streets full time for two years when they were approached by Opportunity Village volunteers.
Torrey: "Alex Daniels and Mark Hubbel came up to me on the corner and my wife and I were holding a cardboard sign in order to make money and they asked us if we might be interested in a pilot project that they were putting together. And I said 'Yes, absolutely.' And it went from there."
Reporter: "If it weren't for this place, do you have any sense of where you and your wife would be today."
Torrey: "Well, like some other people who live here now, we came from the Eugene Mission. We didn't like it there because we can't be together there. They have no accommodations for husbands and wives. So the first thing that attracted me to this idea was that we could be together again, as a married couple should be."
In 2012, the one night homeless count found 1,751 men, women, and children were without permanent shelter in Lane County. That number, while daunting, continues to fuel people like Dan Bryant. He's a pastor at First Christian Church and the board president of Opportunity Village Eugene.
Bryant:"I jumped into this when it was in its original stages eager to help out in any way that I could. Just found a large number of community folk who are very interested in seeing this succeed, who see the problem and feel convinced that we as a community need to find out a different way of doing things."
Opportunity Village is a planned community --with rules.
Bryant: "No drinking, no drugs, no violence, no theft, no disruptive behavior."
Currently 15 people live in the Opportunity Village. It could grow to 45. As a pilot project, the Eugene City Council granted just over a year for them to make it work. That means residents don't want any problems inside. Background checks and interviews are conducted. And everyone must work. Mike Torrey:
Torrey: "I'm on the kitchen committee. I spend a lot of time trying to keep this all clean and organized, making sure people have coffee and keeping everything all straight and tidy."
This micro-housing concept is a prototype that's been successful around the country. It was introduced to Eugene organizers by 26-year Masters student Andrew Heben. He's now on the Board.
Heben: "I did my thesis on organized tent cities, spent a month living in one in Ann Arbor, Michigan. And, so I moved here after finishing my school work, for a job and that kind of aligned with the closing of the Occupy camp which resulted in a task force for homeless solutions."
All the structures at Opportunity Village have been built by volunteers with donated materials.
Heben: "We don't have big time funding but we're getting it done on the power of community."
There are group activities like meals and meetings. This Halloween, one resident couple will get married on site. As homey as this Village may feel--- this is transitional housing.
And Mike Torrey knows it.
Torrey: "The mission statement of OVE (Opportunity Village Eugene) is to transition people successfully out of here back into society. So if all goes well, we will hopefully become a positive statistic."
Opportunity Village Eugene will celebrate its Grand Opening *this Saturday from 1 to 5 pm at 111 Garfield in Eugene.
Strategic Allied Consulting, LLC, the firm run by embattled GOP consultant Nathan Sproul, was paid more than $400,000 in September by the Republican National Committee for "management consulting services," Federal Election Commission filings show.
The firm, which was conducing voter registrations for the party in Florida and other states across the nation, was fired three weeks ago after Florida election officials discovered apparent fraud in registrations handled by the firm.
FEC records show the company was paid $416,665 by the national party in two installments in September. The payments came before ties between the party and the company were severed.
Oddly the company is "Strategic Allies Consultants, LLC" on the party's disclosure forms, though the address given matches the one on file with the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz criticized the RNC's association with the firm in a statement to BuzzFeed, citing a "lengthy history" of voter registration fraud accusations
Despite their public renunciation of Strategic Allied Consulting, the Republican National Committee did not actually break ties with this sketchy firm. The RNC's continued ties to this company, despite revelations of its lengthy history of being accused of voter registration fraud and whose activities on behalf of the RNC in my home state of Florida this cycle is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation, show a complete lack of willingness to protect the fundamental right to vote.
“The RNC's decision to continue to employ a consulting firm with a well-known history of registration fraud and other election-related irregularities is unconscionable, and it is a clear breach of public trust.
“Unfortunately, this is nothing new. Firms led by Sproul have long been associated with allegations of election fraud – including destroying Democratic voter registrations as far back as 2004. Yet RNC Chairman Reince Priebus continues to hire Sproul, showing their disdain for an honest electoral process.
“These allegations undermine our free and open elections. It's clear that Republicans cannot be trusted with voter registrations at any point in the process. The Democratic Party will call out these deceptive practices at every turn and continue to ensure elections are accessible and secure.
Prosecutors Admit They Don't Understand What Weev Did, But They're Sure It's Like Blowing Up A Nuclear Plant
from the wtf? dept
"He had to decrypt and decode, and do all of these things I don't even understand," Assistant US Attorney Glenn Moramarco argued.
In its opening statement, the government made an incendiary comparison that seemed to reflect the nature of its understanding of the crime: the prosecution compared Auernheimer's deeds to hackers "[blowing] up a nuclear power plant in New Jersey" in an attempt to illustrate how it was a relevant venue.
We've been covering the ridiculous DOJ case against Andrew "weev" Auernheimer for quite some time. If you don't recall, Auernheimer and a partner found a really blatant security hole on AT&T's servers that allowed them to very easily find out the email addresses of iPad owners. There was no breaking in to anything. The issue was that AT&T left this all exposed. But, with a very dangerous reading of the CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) and a bunch of folks who don't understand basic technology, weev was sentenced to 3.5 years in jail (and has been kept in solitary confinement for much of their stay so far). Part of the case is complicated by the fact that weev is kind of a world class jerk -- who took great pleasure in being an extreme online troll, getting a thrill out of making others miserable. But that point should have no bearing on whether or not exposing a security hole, by basically entering a URL that AT&T failed to secure, becomes a criminal activity.Throughout the case, it's been clear that the DOJ was trying to make up an interpretation of the law that had no basis in the actual technology world. And it became abundantly clear at a hearing before the appeals court concerning weev's case, that the DOJ really has no idea what weev did. They're just sure it's bad because it involves computers and stuff . Seriously, as reported by Vice:Say what? If that's the basis for being declared a felon and locked up for 3.5 years, almost everyone is a felon. It's likely that under that "standard" Moramarco themselves is a felon, because I'll bet they "decrypts and decodes and all of these things they don't understand" on pretty much a daily basis. But, a tip to the US Attorneys' office: when prosecuting a computer crime, you might want to at least try to have someone who actually understands theof what the person you've locked up has done.But, Moramarco apparently doesn't want to let their complete ignorance of what actually happened (someone putting a URL into a box and seeing the page that AT&T failed to secure) to get in the way of insane hyperbole about what they think weev did:Yes, apparently exposing the fact that AT&T left its customers' info wide open to anyone is the equivalent of blowing up a nuclear power plant. Yikes.As the article notes, much of the hearing actually focused on the question of venue, and it appears that weev may get off on something of a technicality. Prosecutors had moved the case to New Jersey for no known reason and so it may get rejected for being the improper venue, which potentially could mean that the appeals court never even addresses the issue of just how badly the DOJ twisted the CFAA to bring down weev. The judges appear to be considering this, as they noted that based on the details of the case, there was no apparent connection to New Jersey and no reason why the DOJ couldn't have brought the case anywhere (one judge apparently mentioned Hawaii).The case is important because of all the CFAA abuse we've seen by the DOJ over recent years, and now it sounds like the appeals court may be able to just skip over that issue entirely. Given the DOJ's own admissions of its lack of understanding about weev's actions, that actually might be the best thing for the DOJ, allowing it to continue to make completely bogus CFAA arguments to take down technologically sophisticated people that the DOJ doesn't like and doesn't understand.

The International Monetary Fund updated and published online its controversial analysis of debt sustainability of Greece. Accoridng to the analysis the public debt of Greece is unsustainable in the greater degree. This assessment could significantly complicate the disputes over the new utility for Greece because the IMF can participate according to their own regulations in a rescue package only if it considers that the debt is sustainable. Obviously in the case of Greece, this is no longer true.
On the other hand Germany has traditionally stressed that it is ready to provide new aid to Athens only with the participation of the IMF. To participate in the plan to rescue Greece, now apparently wants the fund “haircut” – remission of part of the debt – something that Europe has so far refused to do. Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly said that “classic Haircut”, i.e. forgiveness of part of the debt can not even comment.
The debt of Greece may now become bearable only through facilitation measures that go far beyond what Europe has been taken into account, consider IMF. The sharp deterioration of debt sustainability point to the need to alleviate the debt burden on a scale much larger than what is being discussed so far and suggested by the European Stability Mechanism, the IMF stated. European countries will have to give Greece 30-year grace period in servicing all its obligations to the European partners, including new loans and a very large extension of maturities. Otherwise they will have to make annual transfers to the Greek budget or take large advance cut on their loans to Athens, says the report.
The updated analysis of the sustainability of Greek debt was sent to the governments of the euro zone countries late last night, just hours after Athens and its 18 partners in the Eurozone reached an agreement in principle to start negotiations on a third utility value to 86 billion. Euro against the introduction of austerity measures and structural reforms.

Here are some ways it might have been. 1 / 17 Back to Gallery
In the course of one week in 2017, two of Oakland's sports teams, the Raiders and the Warriors, made moves signaling the end of their time in The Town. And even though they're leaving, in a tough break for Oaklanders, local taxpayers are still going to help foot the bill for a combined $163 million for renovations to the Coliseum and Oracle Arena.
But that wasn't the first time that Oakland, California's eighth largest city and one with a rich history, may have gotten snubbed.
Drew Johnson, an Oakland native and curator of photography and visual culture at the Oakland Museum of California, told SFGATE that Oakland "is an easy town to pick on."
Apparently that's even been the case when Oakland's sports teams become dynasties, like the A's did in the early 1970s.
Now Playing:
"I always think of this joke that Johnny Carson made. The's won the World Series three times in a row in the early '70s and they were doing their monologue," Johnson recalled. "I remember even after all these years for some reason."
Johnson remembers Carson saying that because of Oakland's history of being an industrial town, it was going to have its championship celebration in a tire factory.
Over 40 years later, Oakland still wasn't getting its due when one of its sports teams was on its way to a championship. During the Golden State Warriors' 2015 championship run, national television broadcasts often omitted the name Oakland from its coverage and showed cutaway shots of San Francisco instead of Oakland.
But are sports the only arena where Oakland may have been rebuffed in one way or another? Find out by checking out the gallery above.
By Emily Temple for Flavorwire:
The decades-old controversy over Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" has been in the news again recently following the author's cancelled appearance at the Jaipur Literature Festival in the wake of reported death threats. This intended violence is not the first that Rushdie's novel has inspired, and theirs is definitely not the first real-life danger to come from literature. In fact, several books are reputed to have inspired or informed violence over the years, to varying degrees. The debate over whether the impulse to violence can originate from media — whether film, video games, or books — is a complex one, and we're not seeking to answer it here, though we tend to think that no piece of media can incite a healthy mind to violent deeds (and the violence in Rushdie's case is definitely directly caused by dissent over the book). However, several real-life crimes have been linked to works of literature, and therefore we must consider them at least a little more dangerous than say, "Pride and Prejudice." Nota bene: this is a list of dangerous novels, so any potentially harmful propaganda, religious texts and nonfiction are all ineligible.

This is not a post to convince you that is good for you. It's now common knowledge that the practice of meditation is another important pillar of wellness, along with good , regular exercise, and healthy eating.
But why is it so hard to get ourselves to spend a few minutes each day meditating?
Even as someone who practices -based , leads others in guided meditations, and has found the practice invaluable at many crucial points in my life, I include myself in the group of people who resist meditation.
Maybe you've had a similar experience. Perhaps you were drawn to the teachings of mindfulness, were introduced to meditation, and even enjoyed the practice. You might have found it relaxing, grounding, even liberating—and yet you've struggled to make it a regular part of your day.
It's not that you have hangups about the concept of mindfulness or believe any of the myths about it (as I've written about before). It's not that you don't know that meditation is good for you. It's not that you find it aversive once you're actually meditating. It's just that for some reason there's a block between you and the practice.
I've found this to be common among people I treat in my clinical practice, as well as among my fellow clinicians. And it can't be completely explained by obstacles like, "I don't have enough time." Even people with too much time on their hands have encountered the same resistance.
There seems to be something else going on. If we have the motive, the time, and the desire to meditate, what's getting in the way?
I believe that it's one major factor: When we start meditating, something has to stop.
What has to stop is the mode of mind that keeps us striving, judging, clinging, rejecting, narrowly focusing on "for me or against me," and so forth. That state of mind is resistant to meditating because it dies (temporarily) when we enter into meditation.
So, if it feels like something is fighting for its life to keep you from meditation, it's probably true. It's the ego-driven frame of mind that causes you to feel like "I" don't want to meditate. If it announced itself—"Your ego doesn't want to be put on hold"—you'd probably say, "Too bad, I'm going to meditate." But the ego is subtle and manipulative, and can trick us into serving it rather than our own best interests. By recognizing the mind's resistance to giving up its habitual mode of activity, we can successfully break through it.
I once worked with a woman who was new to the practice of meditation; they quickly saw what their mind was up to. They realized that meditation takes a willingness to step away from the mind's preoccupation with itself and its narrowly defined concerns. And as soon as we exercise our will in that direction—as soon as we decide to meditate—we've stepped away from the ego-driven mind. As they put it so clearly: "Meditation starts when you decide to meditate."
How can we make it easier to make that decision? There are many ways to remove barriers to meditation (in addition to recognizing our own resistance for what it is). Five important ones that I've found are:
Find a regular time. When we build meditation practice into our routine, we avoid having to ask ourselves, "Should I meditate now?" Even if it's hard to find a time that always works, finding a time that often works will raise the odds of doing it. Keep it brief. There is no minimum number of minutes you must meditate. One conscious breath is better than none. One minute is better than none. You can check in with yourself and see if the length of your practice feels more like an opportunity or a sentence. If it's the latter, consider making it shorter. Find a comfortable posture. Being terribly uncomfortable while meditating isn't going to increase you desire to do it. For example, if sitting on the floor doesn't work for you, try sitting on a chair. I used to sit on the floor and often had a lot of discomfort in my back. I found that sitting on a low yoga block felt much friendlier. Choose a form you enjoy. There are many ways to meditate; the important thing is to find one that works for you. Maybe you prefer a more active form like tai chi to a sitting breath-focused meditation. We can benefit from varying our practice at times. Most of my practice involves a sitting eyes-open meditation on the breath, which I've found I like. When it feels right for you, it's more appealing to return over and over. Release expectations. If we're not careful we can bring our ego-driven to meditation: "I hope I'm able to focus." "I want to do this right." "I want to have an experience like I had the last time." These kinds of goals can lead us to evaluate our meditation session as "good" or "bad," and to feel pressure as we consider meditating. We can practice bringing a "beginner's mind" to each practice, being open and curious about what will happen this time.

When we're able to meditate on a regular basis, we find that it's easier to do. Each time we sit and come back to the breath, it might start feeling like returning to an old : "Ah, there you are—you're still here, so I must be, too." It can feel like coming home.
If you've set an intention to regularly meditate and have run into resistance, how can you make it easier to practice today—maybe even right now?

Correction: About Putins "Christmas Speech", For Your information, it was an excerpt from a speech they held at Valdai Conference in 2013. You may find the whole speech at the following link. -DAK
The quotes are correct but obviously the website at left was guilty of fake news.
---------
In their 2016 Christmas speech, which went unreported in the West, and can't be found in full online, Putin confirmed everything "Conspiracy theorists" have said. Civilized moral values have been eroded and the door opened for pedophilia.
"In the West, the moral basis of and any traditional identity are being denied -- national, religious, cultural and even gender identity are being denied or relativized...There, politics treats a family with many children as equal to a homosexual partnership ( judicially ); faith in God is equal to faith in satan..."
They say the PC mentality promotes the propaganda of pedophilia.... Christmas has been suppressed and with it, its inner meaning...The loss of reproductive function in society promises extinction ...the rights of the majority cannot be sacrificed to the rights of the minority. An unipolar world points to the extinction of nations and worldwide tyranny. (Thanks Tim for the tip.)
Makow comment - Although Putin doesn't say. we know the Masonic Jewish banking cartel is responsible for this pillage of Western civilization. They will not give up easily and let Putin and Trump reverse the course they have set. If Trump is sincere in opposing globalism, their life is in danger.
First Comment from James Perloff:
This probably represents the foremost reason why Russia and Putin are now being demonized. During the Bolshevik era, the Zionists murdered the czar and millions of Russians, and demolished tens of thousands of churches. During the Yeltsin years, they thought they squeezed Russia of its last drops of wealth. They wrote the country off as dead and buried.
"The Unthinkable Has Finally Happened: Russia and America Have Traded Places." Instead, Russia is now being revitalized through the hand of God, as visibly seen in the remarkable resurgence of the Orthodox Church. I have summarized the story in my latest blog post,
Captcha systems, those psychedelic-font phrases designed to weed out bots from users, are a staple website security. And, thanks to Stanford Researchers, they may be quickly becoming completely useless.
The researchers employed machine vision algorithms to successfully crack 66 percent of Visa's Captchas, 70 percent of Blizzard's, and 25 percent of Wikipedia's. For reference, a one percent successful cracking rate is regarded as grounds for the Captcha's immediate discontinuation. Only one company's system, Google's ReCaptcha, was able to confound the researchers' robotic eyes—presumably because the vision algorithms still aren't advanced enough to handle ReCaptcha's blurring effects but how long will that advantage last?
Advertisement
So, since it's only a matter of time before A) researchers figure out how to break all of these systems, including Google's, consistently and B) the technology hits the Internet and we're inundated with bot advertising, does anybody have ideas for the next generation of bot filtration technology? Is the time for widespread biometric-scanner use finally upon us? [Maximum PC]

Fighting Roles
Spoiler: STR vs. DEX Show The first question is: are you going to use strength or dexterity? Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so think carefully.
Strength:
-You can use more weapons. So far there are 31 weapons strength-based characters can use, versus 13 that a dexterity-based fighter would use.
-You deal more damage. All of the heavy-hitting weapons, such as mauls and greatswords, can't be used with dexterity.
-You aren't slowed down by heavy armor. In a game where charging doesn't exist, speed is more important than it may seem.
-Athletics can be used for climbing and swimming, both checks that are likely to come up.
Dexterity:
-Initiative. Going first means extra attacks. Extra attacks mean easier fight.
-Ranged weapons. Unless you want to hurl javelins, you're going to need dexterity for ranged combat.
-Dexterity has three skills keying off of it, as opposed to one.
-Saving throws. Dexterity is a far more common saving throw than strength, especially when you fight at range.
-If you are fighting at range, speed isn't that important anyway.
Spoiler: Fighting Role Show In combat, you may want to be the 'I can use all weapons, and so I do!' guy, but most of you will probably want to stick to a single style. A few of the most interesting are noted here.
Sword and Board: I'd say this is the best way to play a fighter. Not only can you choose between dexterity and strength as your primary stat, you also gain great fighting styles, acceptable damage, and about the best AC in the game.
Two- weapon fighting : *gasp* Multiple ratings! TWF starts out as the most damaging fighting style in the book, but drops in usefulness later on. At low/mid-level, it becomes a slightly less damaging and more defensive greatweaponer, which I feel is a bad tradeoff, and at high level even the humble Sword-and-boarder will surpass it in both damage and defense.

Races:
Spoiler: PHB Show Dwarf . Cliched, I know. However, it is actually pretty good when you consider the features. Then again, I'm a sucker for anything that adds utility to a combat-focused character...
- Hill Dwarf . HP boost and more wisdom. Nice.
- Mountain Dwarf . Useless armor and very helpful strength. The strongest of the two dwarves.
Elf . Dexterity bonus? Free perception? Trance? I like it. Ratings are for dexterity-fighters, as you probably expected.
- High Elf . A free cantrip? Yes please. Intelligence is next to useless though. Overall, this race adds a lot to an already good base, assuming you go for a dexterity-fighter.
- Wood Elf . Wisdom boost, higher speed and sneakiness. I can work with this, thank you very much.
-Dark Elf. Charisma (ugh) better darkvision (nice) and spells (not bad). Oh, and Sunlight Sensitivity (Why, oh WOTC?). This feature is a large part of the rating here, so if it won't come into play a lot, I guess the race improves to blue .
Halfling . Small, so no big weapons for you. Brave and Lucky can both be really useful and if you are going dexterity, there isn't a lot you won't like about those little guys. The ratings here assume you do.
- Lightfoot Halfling . Charisma boost, and you can hide easier. I bet those abilities will come in handy on my fighter! Except not, so be a Strongheart instead.
- Strongheart Halfling . You gain a constitution boost. Resist poison will be useful against a pretty large number of monsters (and failing that, it'll at least mean you can drink like a dwarf).
Human . Very bland. That's all I have to say here.
- Standard human . Too unfocused. Half your ability boosts will probably be useless, not to mention that the whole race gets a bit boring eventually.
- Variant human The free feat seems weak, but is actually a great thing to have. Maybe pick Sentinel for extra tankyness? Polearm Master for extra damage? Resilient for proficiency in wisdom saves? How about Tavern Brawler to gain half-orc-level ability scores? This race has so much potential, and it'd be a waste to not try it at least once.
Dragonborn . From what I've heard, the breath weapon is useful more often than it may seem. Still, I doubt it'll beat the cool stuff you can do with your action at higher levels, and the charisma bonus sucks.
Gnome . Another small race, but those are smart instead of agile. I like Gnome Cunning, and darkvision is always useful, but I wouldn't use those if I wasn't playing an eldritch knight.
-Forest Gnome. Speaking with animals and a free cantrip? Sure, why not. Blue if you're going down the dexterity route instead.
-Rock Gnome. Tinker is a very fun feature, and constitution is always useful. Still, feels a bit lacking.
Half-Elf . Free skills, a solid ability and bonuses to the stats you like make those a surprisingly good pick.
Half-Orc . All the features are meant for damage-dealing melee classes... which is both the greatest strength and greatest weakness of this race. If you won't be fighting a lot, drop the rating to Blue . Dexterity-users need not apply.
Tiefling . Of course you want to play a tiefling fighter! After all their ability scores... I mean, their great racial synergy... er... their amazing roleplay potential? Seriously though, this race wasn't meant to be fighters, and almost everything done by it can be done by another race.
Skills:
Spoiler: Class Skills Show Acrobatics - Not so great as it is mostly redundant with Athletics. When you want this, ask yourself: What do I get from this I don't get from athletics? However, if you are dexterity-primary, then it is great and likely the first skill you'll pick.
Animal Handling - Riding and taming animals. More a ranger's thing, although I can see it being useful.
Athletics - Primary stat, and it's used for a lot of things, from grappling to swimming. Take it and love it. Obviously, it becomes less great when you are dexterity-based and can just take acrobatics.
History - Not your job. If you are an Eldritch Knight, you can consider it, but leave it to the wizard if that's not the case.
Insight - Telling if people are lying can be useful; but then again, you hopefully have someone wiser than you. A good pick in a social campaign.
Intimidation - Together with insight your social skill set. Neat, but you won't likely have a lot of Charisma. This skill can have a lot of potential though, depending on what your DM allows it to do.
Perception - I don't care that your wisdom isn't great: this is the best skill in the game (is there any D&D edition where it isn't useful?) and it comes up a lot. Invisible opponents? PERCEPTION. Impeding ambush? PERCEPTION. Need to search a room? PERCEPTION. Stealthy enemies? PERCEPTION.
Survival - Again something I expect the party's ranger to do, but it actually has a lot of uses. Tracking, foraging, navigating... A pity you don't have a lot of wisdom.
Spoiler: Non-Class Skills Show Arcana - An intelligence-based skill, but actually a pretty good one. About everything that isn't 'natural' can be identified with this. For Eldritch Knights , this one is pretty much mandatory.
Deception - If I said this was something you should take, I'd be lying. (Do you get it? Do you get it?)
Investigation - Seeing through illusions already make this interesting, the wide range of uses for it only increase the rating. For normal fighters it is still kind of meh, but an Eldritch Knight should seriously think about picking it up.
Medicine - NO. Buying a healer's kit and/or having a cleric with you already makes this skill near useless. Probably the least useful skill in the game so far.
Nature - Little reason to take it. Even the Eldritch Knights should pass this one up. Beasts and Plants have few special abilities, so even if you face them often this won't tell you a lot.
Performance - Allows you to live wealthily between adventures, but has little use beyond that.
Persuasion - This skill is actually not that bad, even when considering your terrible charisma.
Religion - Same as Nature: Terrible for everyone but EK's, and even they don't want it very badly.
Sleight of Hand - Meh. Not that likely to come up in actual play and it'll only fetch you a few gold at best. Even if you are dexterity-based I'd avoid this.
Stealth - I used to rate this worse, but recent comments have made me realize that it might as well become a very, very often used skill. If you are dexterity-based, assume it is rated blue .
Backgrounds
Spoiler Show Acolyte - Two skills that range from utterly worthless to moderately useful and two free languages. The feature may be very useful but I myself don't see a lot of situations where it'd be something I'd choose over some of the other backgrounds.
Charlatan - I like the feature, but its focus on stats that are tertiary for you at most mean I can't really rate it higher than this.
Criminal - The feature is not that great, and the skills and proficiencies don't really help to get this to a level where I'd recommend it. Black at most, Blue for dexterity-users.
Entertainer - Another background not really made for you, although the feature is nice. The Gladiator variant deserves honorable mention. Of course, if you are going Dexterity, it becomes better
Folk Hero - Solid skills, a flexible tool proficiency (even better for dwarves) and vehicle proficiency make up for the boring feature. All considered one of the better backgrounds to have.
Guild Artistian - Good enough skills, proficiencies that are about equal to the Folk Hero's, and a great feature. Uncommon but surprisingly good.
Hermit - The skills are bad and the feature is DM dependent, but the Herbalism Kit may be reason enough to think about this.
Noble - The skills are not that great, and the proficiencies aren't golden either. Your feature may come in handy a lot though, and the alternative servant option is interesting too.
Outlander - You are going to pick athletics any way, so that is basically a free skill. The proficiencies are less great, but the feature will prevent the group from starving if someone rolls poorly for survival. Dexterity-users have less to like here.
Sage - Okaaaaaay... Two skills, one of which is worthless, languages, and a feature that is worthless at the worst and a plot-hook generator at best.
Sailor - Now we're talking. Great skills, nice proficiencies, and an useful feature. Bad Reputation should be a lot of fun (no, they actually aren't going to sue me for stealing that ale), although it may get books thrown at you. The best fighter background that's out there... if you are strength-primary. (If not, this is instead Blue )
Soldier - Classic. Good all around, but it lacks that bit of 'oomph' Sailor has. Dexterity-users have less to love here.
Urchin - The feature is pretty bad, and I could only see it being useful in chases. The proficiencies and skills are kind of hit-and-miss, but this background fails to impress me in the end. For dexterity-users, it is better .
Class Features
Fighting Style
Spoiler: Styles Show Archery - Obviously only ranged fighters should take this. If they do, it's a solid enough feature.
Defense - Small bonus, but it'll be the first place people look when they get a second feature.
Dueling - Brings your damage output to that of a two-handed weapon. Not bad.
Great Weapon Fighting - The math on this is a little complex, but it basically means 2d6 weapons will deal about 1.5 more damage and 1d12 weapons 0.8 more damage. I think that's a little to low, but your opinion may differ.
Protection - There isn't a lot of stuff you will be using your reaction for, except for a couple of EK spells and Battlemaster maneuvers. But this feature? It rocks. Everyone with a shield should take it.
Two-weapon fighting - This feature is awesome when you are low level. At higher levels, the Dueling and Great Weapon Fighting bonuses will start to give a bigger bonus, so don't pick this in a high-level campaign, or don't TWF at all.
Action Surge
Martial Archetype
Extra Attack
Indomitable
Subclasses
Spoiler: Champion Show I don't like this subclass. Why? It only adds passive bonuses, doesn't give you interesting powers, and although the abilities are neat, I don't like a class that does the same every turn. If you don't think you'll get bored by it, go ahead and pick it.
Spoiler: Battlemaster Show The Battlemaster has no higher-level abilities whosoever, so when you get your final maneuver at 15th level, it is from the same list you chose from at 3rd, and thus likely your 9th favorite pick. However, if you dip fighter for only three levels, I'd say this is your best choice for a subclass.
Spoiler: Eldritch Knight Show Very, very slow casting, but you do gain more options in (and out of) combat. My favorite of the three sub-fighters, although I'm not sure about its power level compared to the others. However, this will likely be one of the few subclasses to grow in power with the release of each splatbook, simply because wizards'll probably get new spells with each of them.
Feats
After moving and changing jobs, I'll be honest – I hadn't caught any Real Madrid games this season. Thus, this Saturday, I was pleased to see an exciting 2:2 draw with Villareal. Here are a few quick thoughts:
The Ozil sale was both a good deal and a bad deal. If Ozil was sold to buy Isco and Illaramendi, then it was good business. The two Spaniards are both younger than Ozil and offer creativity in midfield. Isco is a classic false false nine – you think he's a false nine, but then they do something very un-false niney, like, say, track back and win a tackle. They also remind me not of a soccer player, but a hockey player: Sergei Federov. The former Detroit Red Wings player would lower their head, bend over the puck, and then skate into a maze of three plus defenders. You'd start to shake your head, but, poof, you open your eyes and he's beaten all three.
Illaramendi, of course, looks like a young Xabi Alonso, if Xabi Alonso looked like an older Asier Illaramendi that is. While I personally prefer to call them “Illah” in reference and reverence to Ghostface Killah (may their rap career rest in peace), it's odd seeing “Illara” on the back of their white jersey while Sergio Ramos gets the full name treatment. Illah made some neat passes, even switched fields in true Alonso fashions a few times, and held their position well. Isco and Illara already are contributing and the future is bright.
The Ozil deal, though, is not so great if it was to pay for half of Gareth Bale. Granted, Bale didn't get a proper preseason and it was their first game. Blah blah they scored a goal (!!!) blah blah. However, he'll need some time to adapt to both the rhythm of La Liga and a simple, brutal fact: at Tottenham they played against honest teams, at Real Madrid, everybody but Barça will park the bus. He's got the pace and cannon of a shot comparable to Ronaldo, but we'll see how they fare when they have to unlock tight defenses. Running circles around an aging Maicon too far up the pitch is one thing, scoring against Real Sociedad (not Stoke City) on a chilly Tuesday night is another.
As for the others, we saw the familiar awkward turns of Sammy Khedira and the shoot-from-anywhere audacity (or stupidity) of Angel Di Maria. Benzema was their sluggish self, and their dead fox toupee fooled nobody (except maybe Wayne Rooney). Pepe did their best impression of Fabio Cannavaro's late Madrid career – always a step late and a stud away from a second yellow card. Across the world, madrilenos pray to the Virgin of Guadalupe for a speedy Varane recovery and hope their adamantium knee implant doesn't hinder their pace.
Of course, Barça earned a late win against Sevilla and we know look up to them in the La Liga standings. Should we be worried? Judging by Carlo's “shuffleboard at 4pm” polo, perhaps not. Games are always tight after international breaks, and Carlo's like-for-like subs showed a concern for fitness – not any tactical transformation. Would a 3-5-2 or 4-4-2 have fared better against Villareal's neat passing triangles? Perhaps.
But a point away from home against a good side is still an improvement over last season's horrendous start. Just wait until Carlo whips out their designer suits.

Treasury's got the wrong guy. It's time for Jackson, not Hamilton, to go.
Few people would quarrel with the Treasury's decision Thursday to honor a distinguished woman with a spot on one of the most commonly used bills of America's currency.
But by pushing aside Alexander Hamilton's image to make room for a woman on the $10 bill – instead of replacing Andrew Jackson's image on the $20 bill – the Obama administration has committed a grave historical injustice.
Hamilton – who will remain on the bill in a presumably diminished role—was a founding father, co-author of the Federalist Papers, Revolutionary War staff aide to George Washington, first Treasury Secretary and architect of the early American economy.
They established the nation's first national bank, a very rough forerunner of the Federal Reserve that would spur industry, lend the government money and hold its deposits. Hamilton also advocated a national currency instead of relying on multiple ones issued by various state governments.
Jackson didn't even like paper money and they pursued wrong-headed and disastrous economic policies. Yet the Tennessee frontiersman, land speculator, lawyer, slave-owner, war hero and seventh president – will continue to gaze out from the $20 bill.
[A woman will appear on the $10 bill to mark the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage.]
What did Jackson do wrong when it came to the economy? Lots. Among other things, Jackson dismantled the second Bank of the United States (which they called a “monster institution”) and -- ironically given their spot on the $20 bill – restricted the use of paper money. This lay down the conditions for the Panic of 1837, one of the most severe depressions in U.S. history.
A self-made man, Jackson long harbored a deep mistrust of banks. At the time, there was no Federal Reserve, nor federal banknotes like those we have today. Most Americans at the time paid for goods and services with gold or silver coins or paper notes issued by private firms or state-chartered banks. The value of those paper notes fluctuated wildly.
The Bank of the United States at the time imposed an element of stability. The authoritative history textbook “The Great Republic” says that “the BUS performed many of the functions of a truly national bank,” even though it was largely privately owned. It issued its own notes, but in limited amounts so that their value remained stable. Thus its notes, unlike those issued by hundreds of state-chartered banks, were accepted by the federal government as legal payment for any money owed.
The BUS also served as a regulatory agency, “refusing to accept notes [from smaller banks] that were not backed by sufficient reserves of specie,” the book says.
Finally, the bank's widely accepted and circulated notes eased the challenge of conducting business over long distances.
But when they ran for president in 1832, Jackson waged war on the private Bank of the United States, calling it monopoly and saying it made “the rich richer and the potent more powerful.” It was a message that appealed to widely different interest groups – such as indebted farmers and land speculators pushing the young country westward and eastern banks jealous of the power of the Bank of the United States.
Once elected, Jackson took the federal government's surplus revenues (yes, the federal government was actually running a surplus!) away from the national bank. Instead they spread them around several dozen state-chartered banks, dubbed “pet” banks, which issued new paper notes and loans, feeding a speculative boom and inflation.
But later in their presidency, Jackson slammed on the brakes by insisting on the use of hard money, or coins, rather than paper notes. In 1836, they issued a Specie Circular, requiring payment in coins by purchasers of public lands, sharply curtailing inflation. In 1836, when the bank's charter needed to be renewed, Jackson also vetoed the bill approved by Congress, saying they were taking a stand “against any prostitution of our Government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many.” The head of the bank called Jackson's veto message “a manifesto of anarchy.”
[Historians try to explain why Jackson was put on the $20 bill in the first place.]
Jackson's new contractionary policies coincided with a drop in investment and a sale of American securities by hard-pressed British firms.
The result? Catastrophe. It would be known as the Panic of 1837 by which time Martin van Buren had become president, but investment and employment began to plunge in 1836. A mob of nearly a thousand people sacked warehouses in New York City. Businessmen in Boston protested against requirements to make payments in hard currency. And banks started refusing to redeem paper notes for hard currency.
The downturn lasted about four years, throwing people out of work, ruining many farmers, and forcing the closure of many banks.
(Jackson's influence didn't end there. They appointed their Treasury Secretary, Roger B. Taney, to the Supreme Court. As chief justice, Taney later wrote the infamous majority opinion in the Dred Scott case holding that even free African Americans could not be considered U.S. citizens.)
We've had a lot of panics, depressions and recessions since Jackson's terrible economic policies. No one has quite solved the boom and bust cycle. Yet government and economists know more than Jackson did 175 years ago. Maybe it's time to let “Old Hickory,” as they were known, retire from the field and give the $20 bill a makeover.
[Why a US Senator wants to put a woman on a US greenback.]
IRISH EMPLOYEES had a shorter working week than everyone else in the EU apart from the Danes last year, according to new data. Irish full-time employees spent an average of 38.4 hours in the workplace, two hours fewer than the EU average.
The figures from the EU's statistical agency, Eurostat, show that those in the education sector had the shortest working week, putting in just 31.5 hours. This was six hours below the EU average for the sector and slightly below the time spent at work in 2008.
Only in Greece and Italy do education sector workers have shorter working weeks than their Irish counterparts. Hours are longer in the other 24 EU member countries, with British teachers putting in the longest weeks – at more than 42 hours.
In all other sectors, including public administration and health, Irish employees are much closer to EU averages in their respective sectors in terms of hours worked per week.
Employees in the agricultural sector worked longest – more than 42.5 hours a week.
Irish employees in the aggregate have barely changed the number of hours worked since the recession began. In 2008, the average working week was less than half an hour longer. This is in line with patterns elsewhere.
The working hours gap between the sexes in Ireland is the second largest among the 27 EU countries, according to Eurostat's Labour Force Survey. Salaried Irish men work 3.5 hours more than women. Only in Britain is the gap bigger. The average gap between the sexes across the EU is 1.8 hours. Men work longer hours in paid employment in every country without exception.
The self-employed in Ireland work much longer hours than their salaried counterparts. Self-employed people put in 48 hours a week on average last year, in line with the EU average.
Across Europe, Lithuanian entrepreneurs laboured least, doing a 42-hour week. Their Austrian counterparts were at the other end of the spectrum, working for 55 hours a week.
The figures show no north-south divide in Europe in hours worked, either among salaried employees or the self-employed.
The figures also show Irish employees are less likely to be on limited duration contracts than their counterparts in Europe. One in 10 employees was employed on such contracts last year. The average across the bloc was 50 per cent higher. In Spain and Poland more than one in four people was employed on such contracts.
A wildfire was reported around 4 p.m. Thursday by hikers in the Linville Gorge Wilderness Area of the Pisgah National Forest in Western North Carolina.
Firefighters are responding to the blaze, which is burning on the southern end of the Linville Gorge near Shortoff Mountain, and the United States Forest Service (USFS) has closed the Mountains to Sea Trail from Old Highway 105 at Pinnacle to the Table Rock Picnic Area along with the Shortoff Trail (Trail #235).
USFS is currently investigating the source of the incident, which they are calling the White Creek Fire, but no burn ban is currently in effect for the Linville Gorge Wilderness.
According to a press release issued by the USFS at noon today, the fire has spread to 75 acres with a containment percentage of zero.
At present, there are 100 firefighters on the scene. USFS is leading the response, with support from the North Carolina Forest Service, North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, Burke County Emergency Management, and North Carolina Emergency Management.
Thanks to significant and widespread drought, coupled at times with deliberate arson, the mountains of Western North Carolina and the Southern Appalachians as a whole have seen more than their fair share of wildfires during the fall and winter of 2016-17.

The apparent escape from a high-security lab of a dangerous bacterium that led federal officials last month to suspend research on certain high-risk pathogens at Tulane University has left questions about an ongoing investigation of the incident and broader risks.
According to a lengthy 1 March news article in USA Today, two rhesus macaques at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, that fell ill in early November later tested positive for infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is found naturally in soil and water in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Center researchers had been working with rodents on a vaccine for the bacterium, which can cause a sometimes serious illness called melioidosis in animals and people. The two macaques, which later had to be euthanized, and two other rhesus macaques that tested positive for the bacterium may have been exposed while being treated at the center's hospital.
Adding to concerns, a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) investigator who visited the site in late January fell seriously ill a day later and tested positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is not clear whether the investigator, who has since recovered, was infected at Tulane or earlier during travel abroad, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in February. The agency said it had suspended all studies at the center involving select agents, a list of dangerous viruses, bacteria, and toxins that are tightly regulated. That includes about 10 projects, USA Today reports.
The hospital where the rhesus macaques were treated is located some distance from the biosafety level 3 lab where the vaccine research took place. According to the article, federal officials are still investigating the release of the bacterium. It has not been found in soil or water samples from the site, but USA Today cites studies and documents suggesting that the sampling was not done properly.
Tulane University said in a statement today: “Our work with Select Agents was suspended in February as a result of the USDA investigator falling ill after visiting the Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC). Initial blood tests indicate that this investigator, who has since recovered, was not exposed to Burkholderia pseudomallei at the TNRPC. At present there is no evidence of Burkholderia pseudomallei in any human or non-human primate at the TNPRC.”
The Tulane incident follows several accidents with risky pathogens last year at U.S. high-containment labs that have fueled concerns about dual-use research, or studies of agents that could potential be used as bioweapons. Last summer, the government called for a nationwide search for forgotten pathogen samples in federally funded labs and a review of safety and security procedures.
And in October, U.S. officials halted new federal funding for 18 projects that tweak the influenza, SARS, or MERS viruses to make them more pathogenic or likely to spread among mammals. Federal officials and outside experts are now reviewing the risks and benefits of such “gain-of-function” studies to decide whether they should be allowed to resume.
Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou began historic summit in Singapore with a minute-long handshake – and agree to split the bill for dinner
Leaders of China and Taiwan meet for first time in nearly seven decades
The leaders of China and Taiwan met for the first time in almost seven decades on Saturday as Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou began a historic summit in Singapore with a minute-long handshake. “Nothing can separate us,” Xi told their Taiwanese counterpart in brief public remarks following the handshake. “We are one family … We are brothers who are still connected by our flesh even if our bones are broken.
Ma told Xi both sides had been working “to replace conflict with dialogue ... We follow different political systems, but we have developed military and economic cooperation,” they said.
The meeting between Communist party chief Xi and Nationalist president Ma was the first time two such leaders had come together since Mao Zedong founded the People's Republic of China in 1949. The last encounter between communist and nationalist leaders came in August 1945, when Mao and Chiang Kai-shek came together in Chongqing for seven weeks of talks.
Chinese state media painted the dialogue as a watershed moment which one analyst compared to Richard Nixon's 1972 trip to China, which paved the way for the normalisation of relations between Beijing and Washington. “This is also an icebreaking meeting,” Tao Wenzhou, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told CCTV, the state broadcaster.
Saturday's summit, which was unexpectedly announced on Tuesday night, began at 3pm local time at Singapore's five-star Shangri-La hotel. As Xi and Ma stepped out before the cameras and were bathed in a blaze of camera flashes, the presenter of a live CCTV broadcast told viewers: “This is certainly a landmark handshake.”
On Saturday night, the two men were due to hold a “casual” dinner at the Shang Palace, a high-end Cantonese restaurant where diners can order Australian lobster, Sri Lankan crab and Japanese beef. In an indication of the meeting's political sensitivities, Xi and Ma were reportedly planning to split the bill.
The summit represents a high point in the seven-year rapprochement between Taipei and Beijing that began in 2008, when Ma Ying-jeou took office, vowing to end the political feud between the two sides. Ma, who will step down next year following a presidential election on 16 January, has overseen a striking improvement in relations with Beijing, which still regards democratically ruled Taiwan as a renegade province.
But that engagement has become increasingly contentious in Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, with many of its 18 million voters fearing closer integration with authoritarian China. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets last year to protest that growing proximity as part of the Sunflower movement.
Nathan Batto, a political scientist from Taipei's Academia Sinica, said polls showed that while nearly all Taiwanese supported improved dialogue with China, fewer and fewer now backed the idea of reunification, which is Beijing's ultimate goal. “The separations between Taiwan and China are much, much deeper than between the Koreas or the Germanys,” Batto said. “The public support here is for good relations with China – nobody wants to have a war – but not for any type of political integration. Taiwanese are very proud of their democracy and want to keep it,” they said.
Nick Bisley, the executive director of La Trobe Asia, said Saturday's meeting was “probably the biggest thing in cross-strait relations since at least the lifting of travel restrictions” more than a decade ago. But Bisley said there were concerns in Taiwan that Beijing was using the meeting to try to swing the island's upcoming elections back towards Ma's Nationalist party (KMT).

Tsai Ing-wen, the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) opposition candidate, is widely expected to defeat Beijing's preferred candidate, KMT chairperson Eric Chu. “In 1995/96 they tried to shape the election outcome by lobbing missiles at Taiwan,” Bisley said, referring to the Taiwan Strait crisis. “This time it is a summit.”
Pro-independence protesters reportedly attempted to storm Taiwan's parliament on Saturday morning. Others gathered at Taipei's military airport carrying posters attacking Xi as a dictator and Ma as a traitor.
Saturday's meeting, while the first between the two sides' leaders, is only the latest in a series of high-level encounters between China and Taiwan, which has been ruled as a de-facto independent state since China's civil war ended, in 1949, and Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists fled across the Taiwan Strait. The first came in 1993, when envoys from both sides met in Singapore for the first high-level talks since the war.
In 2005, nationalist chairperson Lien Chan, then leader of Taiwan's opposition, met Chinese president Hu Jintao in Beijing. “What we want is conciliation. We want dialogue,” Lien told their host.
Some see the talks as part of a Chinese charm offensive in Asia, designed to reduce tensions in the region amidst an intensifying spat over Beijing's island campaign building campaign in the South China Sea. “There is a new look and feel to China's diplomacy,” Xinhua, Beijing's official news agency, claimed on Friday. “Never before have China's leaders been so keen to reach out to the world beyond their borders.”

In a seven-minute opening speech at the start of Saturday's summit, Xi told Ma: “Today will be remembered in history. Even though this is the first meeting, we feel like old friends. Behind us is history stretching for 60 years. Now before our eyes there are fruits of conciliation instead of confrontation.”
Ma, who spoke for three minutes, hailed the “unprecedented prosperity” that improved ties between Taiwan and China had brought. “The basis behind this huge transformation has come from peace,” they said, according to Taiwan's official news agency.
Despite the rhetoric, Nathan Batto, a political scientist at Chengchi University in Taiwan, said the talks were unlikely to lead to any noteworthy breakthroughs. “The expectations are low. I don't think anybody is expecting any major developments. The fact of the meeting I think is likely to be the most important outcome of the event,” they said.
Nor was it likely to swing next year's elections back towards the KMT, Beijing's preferred victor. “It would take a major miracle to reverse that trend,” said Batto.
Spent stolen cash on designer clothes and fast cars
A 27-year-old Brazilian mayor has been jailed for 14 years for stealing millions from some of the country's poorest families and spending the money on Champagne and fast cars.
According to The Independent, Lidiane Leite lived in luxury 289km from Bom Jardim, one of Brazil's most deprived towns with a population of 40,000.
From there, they sent directives to the town's officials via a 'Task Force' WhatsApp group while embezzling nearly $8m from the area's education fund.
They documented their glamorous life of expensive dinners, wine, cars and designer clothes on their Instagram profile — which has since been made private — while poverty-stricken children at the local school were denied free meals.
In one post, they wrote: "I can buy whatever I want. I'm going to spend money on what I want and I don't care what people say about me".
After police discovered the missing money (and their lavish lifestyle), Leite went on the run. They gave themselves up after 39 days, and a two-and-a-half year legal battle ensued.
Leite has now been sentenced to 14 years in prison followed by a further six years under house arrest.
Them rise to power was as controversial as their time in office.
Humberto Dantas dos Santos, their boyfriend, was banned from running for mayor in Bom Jardim in 2012 following corruption charges.
Leite ran instead, making dos Santos their chief advisor. The pair split up in 2015 and they resigned, before disappearing when the fraudulent activity surfaced.
They have been sentenced to 17 years in prison with a further seven years under house arrest, but remains on the run.
If you want to know how to save money, it's best to ask those on the front line: people whose circumstances mean they have to put time and energy into making sure they don't overspend. Pensioners, sole parents and students need to get by on very little, and if the rest of us want to live within our means we could pick up some tips from them.
Victorian pensioner Jean Crocker was born during the Great Depression and has always had a frugal way of living. ‘‘You follow what your mother does and mum was the same,'' they say.

When it comes to saving on energy bills, Crocker says they don't always turn the heating on if the sun is shining. They will also fill a thermos with hot water after boiling the kettle in the morning and use the water to make cups of tea during the day. ‘‘I also leave buckets out in summer to fill with rain for watering the garden,'' says Crocker, who also has a rainwater tank from which they can water the garden.
They also have some great tips for saving on grocery bills. ‘‘I always look for marked-down prices on meat. And if there's a special on I'll always buy half a dozen or more, no matter what it is.'' Crocker doesn't waste food and cooks everything they buy. ‘‘If there's half a dozen sausages in the pack I'll cook them all.'' They also buy frozen fruit and vegetables rather than fresh so there's no waste if they can't eat something before it goes bad.
I have already shared my comparison of two JavaScript testing solutions where I admitted that I favor Jest over Mocha. Back then, I listed all major differences between those tools summarized with advantages and disadvantages of migrating to Jest:
Pros: Simpler API, less boilerplate code.
Flexible and easy configuration.
Test files executed in isolation.
Advanced watch mode.
Snapshots support = easier start with testing.
Code coverage. Cons: Another migration.
Mocha has still a bit better performance (according to my quick tests).
My analysis got very positive feedback, with only a few little concerns, so I got encouraged to take action and verify the assumptions stated. I picked two different projects to play with to ensure both of them will uniformly benefit from using Jest.
Gutenberg
There are three main development focuses for WordPress core this year. The new editor is one of them and it is being actively developed on GitHub as a WordPress plugin under the codename Gutenberg. The goal here is to completely redefine content editing experience that makes creating rich posts effortless. This is also an excellent opportunity to modernize technology stack behind WordPress. If you want to find out more how Gutenberg is changing radically the latter, I recommend the blog post from my teammate Riad Benguella.
When I first looked at tests configuration in Gutenberg, it turned out it has a more complicated testing setup with Mocha than I expected. Fortunately, I was able to provide a working proof of concept using Jest in a day or two. It turned out that it is not that hard to make the first test suites pass because both tools use a very similar API. It was sufficient to add the following list of aliases for Mocha methods in the setup script referenced with the setupTestFrameworkScriptFile config option:
global.after = global.afterAll; global.before = global.beforeAll; global.context = global.describe;
It required much more gymnastics to make all the remaining tests pass. It was mostly caused by the Webpack build step included in the flow. Fortunately, it was possible to achieve the same result using Jest configuration options exclusively and thus speed up the boot time by a couple of seconds. The excerpt from the Jest config presented below illustrates how Webpack features can be mapped:
{ ... "moduleNameMapper": { "\\.(scss|css)$": "/test/style-mock.js" }, "transform": { "^.+\\.jsx?$": "babel-jest", "\\.pegjs$": "/test/pgejs-transform.js" }, ... }
If you are keen to learn more about this setup, I recommend diving into the asupervisorstioned pull request. It was satisfactory to see it working, but it was not enough because it is even better to make it right, make it fast. At that stage, all test suites were still using Mocha specific global methods, Chai assertions and Sinon test doubles. It was very convenient in the process of migration, but it seemed like a much better idea to take advantage of API that Jest provides natively. Fortunately, there is an existing tool that turns all that tedious refactoring work into a pleasant experience. The jest-codemods project, maintained by Kenneth Skovhus, offers the interactive CLI mode which covers most of the necessary transformations from Mocha and Chai specific APIs to Jest alternatives. Here is a simplified example of the common changes applied:
# Before - import { expect } from 'chai'; import { registerBlockType, unregisterBlockType } from 'blocks'; import { editor } from '../state'; describe( 'editor()', () => { - before( () => { registerBlockType( 'core/test-block', {} ); } ); - after( () => { unregisterBlockType( 'core/test-block' ); } ); - it( 'should return empty blocksByUid, blockOrder, history by default', () => { const state = editor( undefined, {} ); - expect( state.blocksByUid ).to.eql( {} ); - expect( state.blockOrder ).to.eql( [] ); - expect( state ).to.have.keys( 'history' ); } ); } ); # After import { registerBlockType, unregisterBlockType } from 'blocks'; import { editor } from '../state'; describe( 'editor()', () => { + beforeAll( () => { registerBlockType( 'core/test-block', {} ); } ); + afterAll( () => { unregisterBlockType( 'core/test-block' ); } ); + test( 'should return empty blocksByUid, blockOrder, history by default', () => { const state = editor( undefined, {} ); + expect( state.blocksByUid ).toEqual( {} ); + expect( state.blockOrder ).toEqual( [] ); + expect( state ).toHaveProperty( 'history' ); } ); } );
The only remaining work left was to manually port Sinon spies, stubs and their custom Chai expectations. All of this allowed to get rid of a pretty good number of npm dependencies from the repository: chai , dirty-chai , sinon , sinon-chai and sinon-test . At the same time, those changes made tests execution a bit faster because it was no longer necessary to initialize Chai configuration for every test suite. Finally, it simplified developer experience as the full documentation can now be found in one place – on Jest's website. To get more in-depth knowledge about changes introduced check out the related pull request. The end result was very beneficial with regard to the existing 30+ test suites. It confirmed that testing code with Jest is definitely an improvement compared to what Mocha and friends have to offer.
Calypso
Let's get back to Calypso – a single interface to manage all WordPress.com and Jetpack-enabled sites. I have already shared in the previous post that the initial exploration has started with this pull request. The gist of the research can be concluded with the following quotation:
It was quite easy to get to the point where all unit tests that verify code executed on the server work properly with Jest. I also rewrote test files to use the Jest API to show how writing tests compares to Mocha. I was able to get even further and integrate Jest with Circle CI or PhpStorm. It didn't take much time to setup code coverage and watch mode, neither.
As a final result, this diff got merged not only with the new configuration for server-side testing but also with the revamped setup for the integration tests. Frankly speaking, it was only a very small subset of all existing tests – 8 files in total.
It was about the time to finally tackle over 1 000 test suites living in Calypso repository which ensures the quality of codebase powering the client-side. It needs to be clarified that those tests also verify code that is shared with the server-side part. All tests are grouped under one configuration even though some of them can be identified as unit tests and other as component tests. The first step was similar to the previously described cases, adding the same list of aliases for Mocha specific global API methods. This allowed close to 800 test suites to pass all checks with no effort. However, it took lots of time to make the rest of tests pass. It isn't a big surprise that the size of the final pull request was monstrous.
Let me list the most common refactorings performed:
Mockery served well for quite some time, but its setup was always fragile. To avoid very rare but obviously unexpected timeouts all tests were updated to use file mocks offered by Jest.
Jest checks if matching file contains at least one test. All non-test files like fixtures or mocks had to be moved to subfolders to make sure they don't get listed as failures.
Mocha allows sharing an instance property between all methods for a given test suite. Jest doesn't enable the same option which prevents using this keyword. It is possible to declare a local variable instead to achieve the same goal.
All above helped to get rid of a few in-house developed test helpers:
nockControl – it was no longer in use since the integration tests were introduced. All tests triggering network requests are now grouped under this new type.
– it was no longer in use since the integration tests were introduced. All tests triggering network requests are now grouped under this new type. useFakeDom – it is possible now to set browser-like test environment per test suite using a special comment: /** @jest-environment jsdom */ .
– it is possible now to set browser-like test environment per test suite using a special comment: . useFilesystemMocks and useMockery – Jest offers its own file mocks handling, which is a way more flexible, reliable and faster than what was built on top of Mockery.
Finally, the code that powered Mocha custom test runner got removed altogether with mocha npm dependency. jest-codemods helped to replace Mocha global methods ( after , before , context and it ) with Jest's equivalent API. It made all temporarily added aliases obsolete. At the same time, Chai, Sinon and Enzyme remained integrated without any modifications to make the transition faster and easier. To better illustrate what has changed I prepared a slightly adjusted example of the actual code:
# Before /** * External dependencies */ import { expect } from 'chai'; import sinon from 'sinon'; - import useMockery from 'test/helpers/use-mockery'; - import useFakeDom from 'test/helpers/use-fake-dom'; describe( 'Search', function() { - let EMPTY_COMPONENT, React, TestUtils; - useFakeDom(); - useMockery( mockery => { - React = require( 'react' ); - TestUtils = require( 'react-addons-test-utils' ); - - EMPTY_COMPONENT = require( 'test/helpers/react/empty-component' ); - - mockery.registerMock( 'lib/analytics', {} ); - mockery.registerMock( 'gridicons', EMPTY_COMPONENT ); - } ); - before( function() { - this.searchClass = require( '../' ); - } ); beforeEach( function() { - this.onSearch = sinon.stub(); } ); describe( 'with initialValue', function() { beforeEach( function() { - this.initialValue = 'hello'; - this.searchElement = React.createElement( this.searchClass, { - initialValue: this.initialValue, - onSearch: this.onSearch - } ); - this.rendered = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument( this.searchElement ); } ); - it( 'should set state.keyword with the initialValue after mount', function() { - expect( this.rendered.state.keyword ).to.equal( this.initialValue ); } ); } ); } ); # After + /** @jest-environment jsdom */ + jest.mock( 'lib/analytics', () => ( {} ) ); + jest.mock( 'gridicons', () => require( 'components/empty-component' ) ); /** * External dependencies */ + import { createElement } from 'react'; import { expect } from 'chai'; + import { renderIntoDocument } from 'react-addons-test-utils'; import { stub } from 'sinon'; /** * Internal dependencies */ + import SearchClass from '../'; describe( 'Search', () => { + let onSearch, rendered; beforeEach( () => { + onSearch = stub(); } ); describe( 'with initialValue', () => { + const initialValue = 'hello'; beforeEach( () => { + const searchElement = createElement( SearchClass, { + initialValue, + onSearch + } ); + rendered = renderIntoDocument( searchElement ); } ); + test( 'should set state.keyword with the initialValue after mount', () => { + expect( rendered.state.keyword ).to.equal( initialValue ); } ); } ); } );
Ideally, all the remaining migration steps done for Gutenberg project should be also repeated. However, I think it is reasonable to be more flexible in this case given the scale. Personally, I would keep Chai assertions untouched for the next couple of weeks or months to make the transition smoother for all the existing contributors. If having two different assertion styles turns out to be too confusing, there is always a ready solution to take advantage of – Jest codemods. I'm torn between keeping Sinon or removing it completely. It might be more reasonable to keep the tests using it untouched because rewriting them manually to use Jest mocks would require lots of work with little benefits.
My initial exploration gave the impression that Mocha will perform better than Jest with the set of tests involved. It turned out that it was a completely wrong assumption. It was possible with Jest to speed up execution of all tests from ~90 to ~50 seconds on MacBook Pro 2015. It was achieved by using lazy initialization technique for Chai integration with both Enzyme and Sinon libraries. I learned about this approach from the article shared by Gary Borton from Airbnb. For comparison with Mocha, it took before the transition well over 60 seconds to finish a single run in an ideal scenario where no test randomly timed out.
All the changes discussed above made the Calypso documentation a bit outdated. You can find all updates related to the migration in this pull request. It was also a perfect opportunity to finally document testing approach for WordPress.com.
Final thoughts
First of all, I want to make it clear that I still think that Mocha is an excellent tool for testing your JavaScript code. It gives you lots of freedom by allowing to use any assertion library you want. The same rule applies to the interfaces (BDD, TDD, etc.) and reporters (spec, dot, etc.). It integrates well with mocking libraries and a variety of other test helpers. However, such flexibility comes at a price, you are left on your own to discover which independent pieces need to be put together. You also have to make sure they play nicely with each other. It might be especially challenging to keep with the latest versions of all picked dependencies given that they release new versions on their own pace.
Luckily, Jest addresses those concerns by providing a reasonable default configuration. It combines all the necessary ingredients to allow writing the vast majority of tests. What I like the most about Jest is that it ensures a proper isolation between individual test files. In addition, it parallelizes test runs across workers to speed up things.
If you consider migration to Jest, you rather start with a simple proof of concept. It will help you evaluate if the effort invested will bring expected benefits. There is no guarantee that it will perform better than exceptionally well fine-tuned Mocha configuration. I would also double-check if it can be automated with jest-codemods . Manual refactoring can be very long and tedious for a larger codebase. Personally, I'm very excited seeing how rapidly Jest is evolving. It makes me confident that the number of reasons to migrate from any other existing testing solution to Jest will only grow in the near future.

Today on the twitters, Michael Hendricks asked, “Why do AI people bother with how animal brains work? Most good inventions work by doing things totally unlike how an animal would.”
The short answer is that animal brains can already solve the problems that AI researchers want to solve; so why not look into how they are accomplishing it?
The long answer is that in the end, the algorithms that we ultimately use may end up being dramatically different – but we need a starting point somewhere. By looking at some of the algorithms that have a neural inspiration, it is clear that by thinking about ideas of how the nervous system works machine learning/AI researchers can come up with clear solutions to their problems:
Additionally, companies like Qualcomm and the Brain Corporation are attempting to use ideas from spiking neural networks to make much more energy efficient devices.
In the other direction, neuroscientists can find that the brain appears to be implementing already-known ML algorithms (see this post on Nicole Rust). Many ideas and many biological specifics will be useless – but research is the hope of finding the tiny fraction of an idea that is useful to a new problem.

Neocognitron was the foundation for the ConvNet. Fukushima came up with the model, LeCun figured out how to train it. Support Vector Machines This last one is quite interesting, not many people outside the neural computation community know that Support Vector machines were influenced by the neural network community. They were originally called Support Vector Networks.
Most global polls rate Scandinavian and west European nations as being among the world's happiest and most liveable. Not so says a North Korean survey, which ranked China as "the happiest place on earth."
As Shanghaiist is reporting, a new global happiness index released by North Korea's Chosun Central Television awarded China 100 out of 100 possible points. If the "Gross National Happiness" survey is to be believed, isolated dictatorships are the key to overall well-being, with North Korea reportedly coming in second with 98 points, followed by Cuba, Iran and Venezuela.
Though full rankings and the survey's criteria have not yet been revealed (at least In English), the lowest marks are said to have gone to South Korea, which scored just 18 points to come in at 152, while the United States -- reportedly listed as "the American Empire" -- fared even worse at 203 with a measly three points, MSNBC is reporting. Israel was nowhere to be found.
Still, the survey has created a global media sensation, with resounding grumblings in the blogsophere. "Famine and repression apparently didn't hurt North Korea's standing in the eyes of the 'researchers,'" joked NPR's Mark Memmott, while another commentator reportedly pleaded, "Please send me to the U.S. so I can suffer too."
The United Nations Climate Change Conference is about to begin in Paris, and political leaders from across the world will gather in an attempt to reach a binding, effective agreement aimed at mitigating dangerous climate change. Unfortunately, a poll conducted by GlobeScan has revealed that the public support for such a deal is disappointingly low, with only four out of 20 countries being in favor of a strong deal, as reported by BBC News.
A similar poll taken before the doomed Copenhagen conference in 2009 showed that eight countries favored tough action, twice as many as do now. And this year, just over half of the those queried viewed climate change as a “very serious” problem, compared to 63 percent of people surveyed in 2009. The conference this year is being touted as a genuinely serious attempt at hammering out an effective deal, so this survey will no doubt pour cold water on many political leaders' ambitions.

This survey appears to go against the current grain. With some notable exceptions, many governments around the world have recently been flouting their green credentials. All the Scandinavian countries are initiating a huge drive in renewable energy production, Morocco is pioneering a new 24/7 solar power plant, and other organizations are heavily advertising their carbon capture technologies. The International Energy Agency recently concluded that over a quarter of the world will be powered by renewables by the end of the decade – an unexpectedly high proportion.
In total, 1,000 people were surveyed from each of the 20 countries at the beginning of this year. Not only has the general support for acknowledging climate change as a serious problem declined dramatically in many of the richer nations, but the support for an effective deal at the Paris conference has only grown in three of the 20 countries.
The only four with majorities in favor of their own governments taking a leading role in reaching an agreement are Canada (53 percent), France (54 percent), the United Kingdom (52 percent) and Spain (57 percent). Considering that many U.S. cities will be underwater in the not-too-distant future, it is somewhat paradoxical that only 45 percent of Americans polled in the survey support strong action.

Across all 20 nations, an average of just 43 percent wish for their government to play a leadership role at the conference, compared to 40 percent who want their government only to take a moderate role in support of a deal with only gradual action against dangerous climate change. Lionel Bellier, from GlobeScan, told BBC News that the change from 2009 to now was “not an abrupt change of views, the trend seems to be now towards a softer approach.”
The pollsters hypothesize that the financial crisis of 2008 has had an effect on the public perception of the importance of dealing with climate change; many began to prioritize economic success as being more important than environmental issues, particularly in developing countries. China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, only has 18 percent for strong action – it has recently seen its economy suffer, which has likely dampened public support for action against climate change.
“When we look at the broad range of environmental issues, they all have gone down in terms of concern, in all countries, since 2009,” added Bellier, “at the same time you see that concerns about the economy have risen, and what's capturing the agenda is terrorism, which has risen up the agenda over the last two years.”
The Republican party has no shame. They lie, cheat and steal their way into office. They embody such good Christian values…cough, choke, spit.
I often fantasize about a movie in the style of “Oh God”, where George Burns (God) confronts people like Michelle Bachman and Louie Gohmert or a long list of Republicans who blatantly tell falsehoods, repeatedly and even after being called out on it. If there is a hell, I imagine there will be an especially hot place reserved for these people.
It's not often that we get to see the birth of one of these lies, placenta and all. From Steve Benen…
The National Republican Senate Committee accused Markey yesterday of claiming they “invented the satellite dish, low-cost mobile phone calls, and the ability for cable companies to provide long distance service.” The NRSC added, “Perhaps Markey can use the technology they invented to call, tweet, or message their friend Al Gore, inventor of the internet.” Conservative humor is just so droll, isn't it? The problem, of course, is that the National Republican Senate Committee is lying. For one thing, Al Gore never claimed to be the inventor of the Internet. It just never happened — Republicans distorted a Gore comment, the media uncritically ran with it, and a ridiculous smear quickly entered the public consciousness. For another, Markey didn't say they “invented the satellite dish.” Matt Yglesias sets the record straight.
What Rep. Ed Markey helped to do in the 1992 Cable Act was to force the cable companies to license content to satellite companies in order to compete with the vertically integrated cable systems that were beginning their takeover of television markets. Competition being a good thing, right?
I guess it's hard to blame them for attempting it, since the “Al Gore invented the internet” lie worked so well for them in 2000. And with the superficial media, who I'm beginning to think are illiterate, gladly helped to perpetuate that lie.
The sad thing is, the media is much worse than it was in 2000. Let's see how they handle this one.

TUSCALOOSA, Alabama -- One of the most decorated individuals in Alabama football history has received an award that probably tops all of their previous awards.
Senior center Barrett Jones has become the first Crimson Tide player to win the prestigious Campbell Trophy, known more casually as college football's academic Heisman Trophy.
The award, which goes annually to college football's “best and brightest,” was presented Tuesday night at a National Football Foundation dinner in New York.
Earlier this fall, Jones had been named one of 15 finalists for the award. As members of the 2012
NFF National Scholar-Athlete Class, those 15 players receive an $18,000 post-graduate scholarship.
With the Campbell Trophy, Jones' scholarship was increased to $25,000.
At a press conference Thursday before the dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria, Jones first showed their gratitude and then their sense of humor.
“First and foremost, I'd like to thank the National Football Foundation and their sponsors,” they said. “This has truly been a first-class event, and being at Alabama, I am used to staying at nicer hotels than the Waldorf.”
But this was no laughing matter.
“Seriously, this event has been more than the first-class amenities and the Rockettes and the nice dinners,” Jones said. “Charles Barkley's famously said 'I'm not a role model.' I think the fact is, with all the exposure college athletes get today, we are role models. I think everyone sitting here are people that use that status in a positive way. I'm very grateful to be sitting on stage with 14 other worthy candidates."
A three-time Academic All-American, Jones carries a 4.0 grade point average. He's a four-year starter who on Jan. 7 will compete with their teammates for their third BCS National Championship.
Jones, named one of three 2012 permanent captains on Sunday, started their college career as a right guard for two years, then won the 2011 Outland Trophy as a left tackle. As a center this season, they could become only the second two-time Outland Trophy winner, and they are a finalist for the Rimington Award that goes to the nation's best center.
The Campbell Trophy has been presented since 1990. Previous Alabama finalists were Greg McElroy (2010) and DeMeco Ryans (2005).
Three other Alabama players were named a NFF National Scholar-Athletes: Johnny Musso (1971), Randy Hall (1974) and Steadman Shealy (1979).
This year's finalists:
Matt Barkley, QB, USC
Rex Burkhead, RB, Nebraska

Hacking a scammer is a bit like someone beating up a bully–it's pretty hard to sympathize with the victim in this case. What happened was that our unsuspecting hero was sent a PayPal scam via email. The fake “PayPal verification” was easily identified (PayPal would never email asking for personal information) so they started to do a little investigation.
With a simple ping of the domain the helpful hacker–Reddit user Tomble–was able to figure out the scammer's FTP address. With this they figured out that the FTP password was set as “password” and they could start to fight the phisher's wrongdoings. The incredible thing is that Tomble didn't stop at updating the scammer's site to a kitten-filled warning page, they also tracked down the saved contact details of victims. They proceeded to reach out to each of them, explained that they had been hacked, and had them cancel their credit cards and/or contact their banks so that no harm would come to them.
Some of the people who were contacted were understandably suspicious but they came around and figured out that Tomble was on their side. Because they had their phone numbers they were able to call each person and explain what had happened, as opposed to them receiving an email that would have seemed even more questionable to them than the original phishing attempt. They even contacted the ISP and asked to have the FTP shutdown.
Tomble noted that the victims were between the ages of 39 and the late 60s, which comes as little surprise given the type of scam.
And, as one Redditor pointed out, Tomble's hacking wasn't a punishable action. It was a case of necessity, which says that under certain circumstances you won't be held accountable when doing something illegal if the action is justified. So you can be excused of liability if you hack a hacker or, say, blow up a building when saving the world from alien attack.

The last time I saw my doctor, they asked me how many drinks I have per week. “I don't know, maybe 10,” I said. They wrote my answer on a clipboard. “No wait, I guess it's more like 15. Or 20?”
“Well, which is it?”
I had no idea, and that seemed like a problem. My fuzzy recollection corresponded to a range that includes both low-risk (or even healthy) levels of consumption—one or two drinks per day for men—and more dangerous behavior. Did my habit put me in the normal range, or had I unwittingly become a heavy drinker?
In the months that followed I kept a tally of my tipples, I think more out of curiosity than dread and discovered that my intake changes through the year: boozy winter, sober spring. But overall the numbers gave me some relief. It turns out that I'm not a lush at all, but a somewhat temperate fellow who has an average of 11 drinks per week.
That sense of normalcy didn't last very long. A couple of weeks ago, the Washington Post put out a shocking chart that shows how much alcohol U.S. adults consume, and it was plain to see where I fit into the distribution. My weekly total, still shy of a dozen drinks, puts me in the very drunkest quarter of Americans. Almost 30 percent of the country never touches alcohol, the chart declares, and another 30 percent do so only on special occasions—at most once every couple of weeks. And then there are the rest of us, the inebriate winos like me and all my friends and almost everyone we know.
The more I thought about these data, the stranger they seemed. My 11-drink-per-week habit corresponds almost exactly to the national average, 556 drinks per year. But according to this chart, that number would be grossly misleading, since it combines the huge number of people who never quaff at all with the much smaller group who drink like it's their job. (Those in the top decile of consumption swig an incomprehensible average of 74 drinks per week.) When I compare my habit to the median instead of the mean, I find that I'm dosing myself with 10 times more alcohol than the typical American.
At first I thought the figures must be wrong. But the author of the chart, Christopher Ingraham, had pulled them from a 2007 book by the Duke University economist Philip J. Cook, who drew from fieldwork conducted by the Census Bureau for the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.* Cook's NESARC data are a little old—they come from 2000 and 2001—but by all accounts they're unlikely to have changed. In fact, the pattern they represent, with a tiny minority responsible for almost all the nation's drinking, has remained more or less a constant over many decades, and it seems to hold for other countries, too. It's like a golden rule for alcohol research: No matter where or when in history you look, consumption fits into the same, skewed distribution.
Like all good things related to alcohol, the “single-distribution theory” got its start in France. After World War II, an Algerian-born ex­–artillery officer named Sully Ledermann started trying to figure out why their French countrymen lived such shorter lives than men in other European countries. By 1946 he'd figured out that the higher mortality rates were concentrated among men of middle age: A 40-year-old Frenchman was three times more likely to die than an age-matched Dutchman and twice as likely to die as an Englishman. Ledermann blamed these early deaths on booze.
Their evidence was straightforward: Ledermann noticed that, over time, death rates in France corresponded to the country's total consumption of alcohol and that people died most often in the regions where they drank the most—Brittany and Normandy. According to an excellent article by the late Norwegian sociologist Ole-Jorgen Skog, Ledermann's idea went against the prevailing view among their colleagues in English-speaking countries. In England and America, most researchers believed that alcoholics—the people most likely to die from too much drinking—were the victims of a special predisposition or disease and that their condition had little to do with the standards for “normal” drinking where they came from. If that were true, then the rate of deaths from alcoholism should be fairly constant from one place to another. It wouldn't matter if the average person were drinking one glass of wine per day or two or three or five; the drunks would still be drunks.
Ledermann's data suggested otherwise. To him, it looked like the rate of alcohol-related mortality rose and fell atop a social tide, instead of floating somewhere on its own. In fact, there seemed to be a predictable relationship between the number of alcoholics in a given place or culture and the amount of booze consumed overall. They argued that a single type of curve—the log-normal distribution—could describe the nature of this relationship, and then they made an even bolder claim: That standard curve would keep its shape even as overall consumption habits changed. If Frenchmen started drinking more, that trend would turn some abstainers into social drinkers, and some social drinkers into sots.
Their theory helped explain why at the end of the 1930s, when so many Frenchmen were dying young, the country's alcohol consumption peaked at an average of almost five drinks per day, or 33 per week. Since then, French intake has declined by more than half—as of 2009, it's down to two drinks per day—but it's still much higher than in most other European countries. (Only the Czech, Estonians and Irish take more liquor.) A recent study blamed French drinking habits for 49,000 early deaths per year and a full 13 percent of the nation's male mortality.
For our part, Americans drink a little less than the French on average, and researchers here have attributed 9.8 percent of all deaths among working-age adults to excessive drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks deaths from 54 different alcohol-related causes, including falls, car accidents, acute toxicity, liver disease, stroke, and multiple types of cancer.
As it happens, Ledermann died in middle age himself, in 1967. In the decades since, their single-distribution theory has been tweaked but never fully contradicted. (Ole-Jorgen Skog gave the theory its most thorough working over in the 1980s.) The alcohol-consumption curve does seem to take a roughly standard form, but its shape isn't as precise as Ledermann claimed. Similarly, their argument that any change in mean consumption will change the alcoholism rate in predictable ways doesn't always hold. But when it comes to assessing public policy, it's not a bad rule of thumb.
Ledermann's work may be as interesting, though, for what it says about why we drink the way we do. They argued that the standard, skewed pattern of alcohol use arises from the way that drinking spreads: as a social contagion. If I was surprised to learn that my “modest” drinking habit places me well outside the American mainstream, that's just because I see my friends' behavior as the norm. When you're sitting on the slope of that consumption curve, it can be hard to keep things in perspective.

Soft Sounds From Another Planet
Japanese Breakfast
Japanese Breakfast's 'Soft Sounds From Another Planet' is less of a concept album about space exploration so much as it is a mood board come to life. Over the course of 12 tracks, Michelle Zauner explores a sonic landscape of their own design, one that's big enough to contain their influences. There are songs on this album that recall the pathos of Roy Orbison's ballads, while others could soundtrack a cinematic drive down one of Blade Runner's endless skyways. Zauner's voice is capacious; one moment she's serenading the past, the next she's robotically narrating a love story over sleek monochrome, their lyrics more pointed and personal than ever before. While 'Psychopomp' was a genre-spanning introduction to Japanese Breakfast, this visionary sophomore album launches the project to new heights.
The situation is even worse if we look at the tropics, with an 83% species decline in Latin America. These are sobering statistics for me, and I'm sure for you as well.
Today, World Wildlife Fund released the 2014 Living Planet Report . The report is always a must-read update on the state of the planet, but this edition is especially important for anyone who cares about biodiversity. The headline finding is that vertebrate populations around the world have declined by an average of 52% between 1970 and 2010.
If you dig deeper into the Living Planet Report, you will discover that animal declines are not uniform around the world. Freshwater species have been especially hard hit, down 76% in my lifetime, compared to “just” 39% for terrestrial and marine species. Animal populations in Latin America are down a shocking 83%. Elsewhere in the species-rich tropics, populations are down 56% percent compared to 36% in temperate zones. The world's network of protected areas is helping limit the losses as animal populations in parks and wildlife refuges are only down 18%. While the magnitude of declines may vary, the trend lines all point in the same troubling direction — down.
Why are we seeing these alarming trends? Simply put, they are a consequence of the growing demands of the human population. More people are consuming more natural resources. And insodoing, they are clearing forests, plowing grasslands, polluting waters, and emptying the oceans.
This is not just a problem for wildlife. It's a problem for you and me, too. As I wrote about in a previous LiveScience post, humans are consuming natural resources faster than nature can replenish them. Every year, we use 1.5 planet's worth of natural resources. Overshoot day marks the day when we have used up our annual supply of renewable resources and start spending down the Earth's natural capital. This year that day was August 20, and it comes earlier every year.
Instead of living sustainably within our ecological means, we are borrowing from our future to pay for our present. According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 60% of ecosystem services — things like water supplies, fish stocks, fertile soils, and storm protection — are already in decline because of human impacts on the natural environment. Sometimes you need to dip into your savings to make ends meet, but you go back to saving again as soon as you can. Well people have been dipping into the planet's natural capital account since 1975, and every year we take more than we took the year before.
So what are we to do? When my colleagues and I reflect on our conservation work, we see hope in WWF's past accomplishments to protect the world's most important places like the Amazon and iconic species. When we take a clear-eyed look at the trends described in the LPR, we also know we will have to accomplish much more in the future. I am most excited about three things that WWF is doing to start to reverse the current trends in animal populations.
First, we are looking at our conservation strategies with fresh eyes to ask how they might be scaled up to achieve larger conservation impact. The secret lies in developing strategies that can be implemented by others, effectively multiplying the impact that WWF could have by itself. To do that, we are using science to develop forecasts of how much conservation impact we think a project may have in order to identify the most promising strategies. And we are using impact evaluations — common in the health sector but cutting edge in conservation — to rigorously measure the impacts of strategies so that we better understand the conditions under which they can be successfully replicated.
An example of a multiplicative strategy with great potential impact is community-based conservation. WWF has been working in close collaboration with a number of communities in Namibia to develop their own conservation programs. The results have been a resurgence of rhinos, lions and other wildlife, and economic development opportunity for local people. Variations of this strategy are now being developed with communities all around the world, from Nepal, to the Arctic, and even with Native American communities in the Northern Great Plains of the US.
Finally, WWF is working with the private sector and with governments to help them incorporate natural capital considerations into their business and development decisions. WWF and The Coca-Cola Company have already collaborated to significantly reduce the amount of water used to produce beverages and other products. WWF scientists are now working with Coke to use natural capital accounting to source agricultural commodities that are sustainably produced and will contribute positively to watershed health. In Belize, WWF scientists have helped government officials and stakeholder groups to develop a science-based coastal zone management plan that balances economic development with protection of vital natural capital such as coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove forests that attract tourists, sustain fisheries, and protect coastal towns and infrastructure
These strategies give me hope in the face of the LPR trends because they show the promise of what might be accomplished when conservation harnesses the creative potential of innovation and the multiplicative power of collaboration.
Tisha Casida is a 29-year-old southern Colorado-bred conservative. The Keystone XL Pipeline, they suggest, is safer and probably better for the environment than sending oil tankers across the Atlantic. The country's conflict over carbon dioxide, they hint, may be as much a waste of time as the war on drugs. They make no bones that they are disappointed in their member of congress, Scott Tipton, because they haven't demonstrated leadership on a few crucial issues, like speaking out against the Patriot Act.
So they are taking them on in 2012.
Even though Casida announced their candidacy at the Historic Federal Building in Pueblo on May 13, there's a good chance you still haven't heard of them Political observers in the 3rd Congressional District all know the name of the other congressional candidate in the area, Sal Pace, a Democrat. But as an unaffiliated candidate, Casida doesn't get the same attention. Them campaign is organic and in its infancy, much like their business, That's Natural!, which promotes sustainable agriculture. Casida also has a real estate license and they publish The Good American Post.
Despite the obstacles, Casida is getting noticed. Last month the Liberty Candidates endorsed their campaign. Former Libertarian presidential nominee and constitutional scholar Michael Badnarik recently joined their team of about ten. Several of their staffers campaigned for Ron Paul in the past.
 They are not married but was once. “I was married at one time to a young man in the military and after they came back from Iraq, it was apparent that their emotional state would not allow for us to continue a meaningful relationship,” they explained. “It was devastating, and that has of course impacted my love for our troops as well as a desire to have them fighting only Constitutional wars.”
They have never run for office before. They grew up on a farm in Vineland, Colo., — they were baptized in the Arkansas River — and they say they simply want to “represent the people who live here.”
In a recent e-mail interview with The Colorado Independent, Casida explained themselves and their views.
Q. As a conservative, how is Scott Tipton failing to meet the expectations you have for the position?
A. As a representative, I expect Scott Tipton to unequivocally stand against intrusions into the American people's rights and pocketbooks. I believe they are doing a good job of walking the party line and voting what some would call “conservative,” however they are not:
1. Speaking out against the Federal Reserve System and its effects on the nation's currency
2. Speaking out against the Patriot Act
3. Speaking out against the National Defense Authorization Act
Q. Would you work to weaken the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency as other conservatives in Congress are doing?
A. Yes. I do not believe the EPA is doing a good job of protecting the environment – most of what they are doing is causing problems for businesses. The concept of environmental protection must be taken to a state and local level in order for such an agency to remain true to its mission and work with the people who are impacted by rules and regulations.
Q. Do you support local decision-making on all issues?
A. Yes, making decisions at a local level allows for people closer to the issues to be more involved in the processes. Making environmental decisions closer to home also allow for representatives and officials to remain transparent and accountable. It is easier to go to Denver to talk to someone than it is to go to Washington, D.C. I am not going to make a blanket statement about all federal standards – I am sure some are good and some make no sense – the fact is that people closer to Colorado, including environmentalists and leadership in Colorado – are more capable of making decisions for environmental standards for Colorado. As a matter of fact, holding decision-making and implementation closer to Colorado will likely be good for our local economies. Instead of sending money to Washington, D.C., we can keep it closer to home.
Q. What about the war on drugs? Do you support the ability of states to legalize medical marijuana?
A. The drug war is a complete fallacy and is doing nothing to stop drug use. If people are apt to use drugs, no legislation or war will stop them. You cannot legislate morality or behavior. I absolutely support the ability of states to legalize medical marijuana. As a matter of fact, it is incredibly beneficial to local economies. Constitutionally speaking, marijuana growth and use is not a federal issue at all. There is nothing stopping people from growing or using a substance, which is in effect, a plant.
Q. Given your interest in sustainable agriculture and organic foods, do you have an opinion on the raw milk raids occurring across the country?
A. I believe that organic and raw foods are products that have existed on the planet for thousands of years (maybe more) and there is no reason that federal agents should be accosting people for their choices to consume these foods. Government cannot protect us from ourselves. After being exposed to pesticides as a child and becoming ill, I went on an organic diet, that I continue to this day, in an effort to de-toxify my system. I am also a consumer of raw milk, and believe that it has many health benefits. My grandmother drank “raw milk” as a child – they called it “milk.” People have the right to consume foods and nutritional supplements that they feel are beneficial to them. Every action of a human being involves some risk, there is no way to regulate every action that may be dangerous to our own well-being. That is where free will and personal responsibility come in to play.
Q. How concerned are you about fracking?
A. It depends on the situation. I can understand both sides of this issue, and I think that it is dependent upon the area, the people, the company, and the practices – each of these variables plays a part – in some cases I believe it can be performed responsibly. In other cases, I am sure that these practices are abused. I am most concerned about the transparency of the methods and practices used, especially in instances where the public is a part of the stakeholders.
Q. Should drillers be required to reveal what is in their fracking fluids or should that be proprietary?
A. Absolutely, I believe that they should be required to reveal what is in the fluids because these fluids are becoming a part of the ecosystem.
Q. Do you support the Keystone XL Pipeline?
A. Yes. Pipelines run through the entire U.S. Although there are periodic problems with these pipelines, they have an incredible safety track record. This project would provide jobs, growth, and energy independence. From an ecological standpoint, don't you think it is safer and less intrusive on the environment to pump oil from Canada versus loading it in tankers and trucking it across the ocean?
Q. Do you believe humans cause climate change?
A. No, I believe the climate change we are seeing is from changes in the earth itself; however, there are many pollutants other than CO2 that are incredibly dangerous to the environment and people's health that should be mitigated – these chemicals should be the focus. People and the private sector need to step up to the task, because the federal government is doing a terrible job at it. We should also never act in fear – to my sadness, it is a tactic too often used from both “the right” and “the left” to push the American people into making decisions that intrude upon our individual liberties. Regulating CO2 is dangerous – making a fair marketplace where renewable energy can compete on the same playing ground as other types of energy is smart.
Q. Where do you stand on abortion?
A. As a female I cherish the ability to give life and find the current statistics concerning abortion horrifying. Nonetheless, the federal government can never tell a woman what to do with their body. We cannot legislate morality – instead of picketing at places like Planned Parenthood, we should get involved in our communities and help these young women so that such a horrible choice would never have to be made in the first place. Our country has a moral problem when it comes to this issue – the government can't fix it, but we can.
Q. Which current presidential candidate best reflects your views?
A. Ron Paul – they are consistent, they are fiscally conservative and arguably more socially liberal, and they love the people of this country.  They are a statesman, a representative, someone who does not take the American people's money and abuse it.  They are humble, reflective, and a good person with integrity. We need people in D.C. who are representatives and not politicians; they best reflects that in my mind.
Q. Are you a Liberty candidate or an Independent? Do you really think you have a chance of beating the big party candidates?
A. That is up for whoever wants to define either of those – I am Tisha Casida, and people are free to label me based on their world views and frameworks – it differs for everyone. I absolutely have a chance – that is the only reason I am running – to win. People's anger and resentment at the parties, and politicians in general, will make 2012 a unique election year. Colorado has an equal number of “Independent” voters to the two parties, and we have more and more people thinking that way every day.

'I get angry when people throw ink or slap them -- but Arvind takes all this in their stride. People make fun of them and point out their mistakes, but they haven't seen theirs sacrifice...'
'If you understand their commitment towards this country, you will not dare say anything against him.'
Dr Bipin Mittal, a longtime friend and family doctor of the Aam Aadmi Party leader, tells Rediff.com's Archana Masih about the Arvind Kejriwal few knows.
Arvind first came to me as a patient. They hadn't slept the whole night because of a toothache. I told them they needed a root canal or extraction.
I was cheaper than other dentists in the locality, but when I told them the price, they said they couldn't afford it. They got the tooth pulled out.
In my wildest dream I couldn't have imagined that an IRS (Indian Revenue Service) officer cannot afford a cheap dentist.
Then once on the eve of Diwali, I had gone to buy diyas and I saw the husband-wife sitting outside their building behind a table with some gift items.
"What's this?" I asked. They said before Diwali, they had put a notice outside the gate saying 'No gifts.' but despite that people gave them. "This is a forced way of giving ghoos (bribes) during Diwali -- like mithai for the kids," they said.
They told me they were sitting there to sell them off and give the proceeds to an NGO.
It was so shocking for me. An IRS couple sitting on the road -- it was unimaginable.
I get angry when people throw ink or slap them -- but Arvind takes all this in their stride. It angers me because they have a different stature for me. I am an atheist, but to me, he's God...
When they called a press conference against Robert Vadra and later against others I was very scared. In western UP, you know what the law and order situation is like. The value of one's life is not much here.
We then thought of putting a request that if they don't want government security, they should keep some AAP volunteers with them 24 hours. But they aren't ready. We then put up a page on Facebook -- that your body is national property, it belongs to us -- and there were 10,000 people who signed in no time, but they didn't yield.
They have tremendous conviction.
When we entered the fray in the assembly we could feel the pulse. The volunteers were so pumped up. Our volunteers have a different mindset, they were there with Arvind for a cause and that cause was supreme in their minds.
When they were thinking about contesting against Sheila Dixit, I told them it was political suicide. Arvind's victory in New Delhi was the most amazing of them all...
The problem is that the media has suddenly become so important in the country, that it is the media which basically makes people's viewpoint. (Dr Mittal is referring to the perception that people are disappointed with Mr Kejriwal's resignation as Delhi chief minister after just 49 days in office)...
The educated middle class is little disappointed. What these people don't understand is, how do you rein in people? Most of our ministers were just common people. If someone gives me 50 crore (Rs 500 million) to sign a paper, I don't know -- I am clean till I am given the opportunity, isn't it?
Without a Jan Lokpal it was a very risky. With a Jan Lokpal you could have improved everything. So you can see the glass half full or half empty...
No doubt, it was the support from the educated middle class that got us so many seats, but their resignation can be debated.
The educated are saying they gave up responsibility, you only tell me if any one banda had made a mistake, everything would have reflected on Arvind alone and they would have been destroyed forever.
The truth is ki us gaddi ke andar na bichoo hain (The highest throne is fraught with immense danger).
A tough law like the Jan Lokpal is needed that even if Arvind makes a mistake, they will be accountable...
The problem is the educated middle class of this country like to discuss this over coffee. They will never come out on the streets and face police batons or water cannons. How many of these will send their kids to the border?
The reality is that this disappointment (that a section of the middle class is feeling with Mr Kejriwal) is just a matter of time. This so-called euphoria for Narendra Modi is just a matter of time.
Doodh ka doodh aur paani ka paani hone mein zyada waqt nahin lagega (The truth will be revealed soon). The educated will soon realise that Arvind is the right person.
Arvind power ke peechey na kabhi tha, na kabhi rahega (Arvind was never and will never be hungry for power). The reality is that they are 45 going on 46.  They are in their prime and they have never been materialistic...
I have known them since 1995, but wasn't very close in the beginning.
They thought of a pilot project in Kaushambi (in Ghaziabad, where Mr Kejriwal lived till they moved to New Delhi) for which they needed my help because I was always a very social person.
Arvind has always been very passionate about their work. Once they get after something, toh lag jaata hain.
For two-and-a-half years, Arvind and me would be together from morning to evening. We used to go to every household -- there was no sewer outlet and we used to tell people why are you giving house tax which also has a sewerage charge, when you are not getting these services?
People had never thought about it. These people were educated people, happy with their homes being clean and not bothering where the sewerage was going.
After two-and-a-half years of hard labour, the local administration, especially the commissioner of Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam, Ajay Shankar Pandey, younger brother of Vijay Shankar Pandey -- Mayawati's right hand man -- promised at a public function that all civil services, maintenance of street lights, roads, parks etc would be given to RWA (resident welfare associations) to maintain.
Swaraj (Mr Kejriwal's book) basically says that services like roads, water, sewer, street lights -- the maintenance will be done by the locals. Whatever money is allocated by the State will be spent according to the wishes of the local people. Money to contractors will only be paid when local people clear it.
Parivartan (an NGO formed by Mr Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia) was formed in 2001. Manish Sisodia has been with them right from the first day.
Fighting the Lok Sabha election, according to me, was a big folly. Arvind also wasn't in its favour.
After December 8, there was lots of euphoria. For many like me the euphoria should have been used to strengthen the organisation, but then most of the people in the higher-up hierarchy wanted the party to fight the national election. They wanted the euphoria to be utilised there.
Arvind never wanted to fight the Lok Sabha. Never.
But all the rest of them thought that achieving a certain percentage in the national election would get them recognition as a national party, but just two months with Arvind and Manish busy with the Delhi government -- according to me that was one mistake.
Even if the result (of the Lok Sabha election) is not good, people like Arvind never tire and give up... Woh thak ke ghar baithney walon mein se nahin hain (He is not going to give up and sit at home).
When nothing came after our public meeting, dharna with Commissioner Pandey, Arvind took swaraj to a higher pedestal, met leaders of political parties, legal luminaries.
The pessimism that has set in Indians needs to be overcome. With the AAP, for the first time people came to know that is tarah ki rajneeti bhi jeet sakti hain (This kind of politics can also succeed).
I trust them completely. Woh isaan apne ko taak pe rakh kar is desh ke prati jo apni soch rakhta hain na woh is desh ke log ko kuchi time mein samajh ayega (He is selfless and thinks about the nation. The people of this country will realise this soon).
When the Anna andolan happened in August 2011, we were not thinking on political lines at all. It is only after the prime minister gave us a signed letter and that promise was ratified by Parliament, but once these people went back on their word, people started talking about political lines.
My father tells me a few months later, they and Arvind had gone to the metro station in an auto. Papa told them there is no other option than to enter politics and they vehemently denied it.
("He said he'll never join. This is in 2011," says Dr Mittal's father who is also sitting in the room.)
At that time it was only people who were suggesting it to us, there was no voice coming from within.
Each and every word of the Jan Lokpal bill was drafted by Arvind. When this movement was being planned, the banners were being designed, I had told Arvind that it's your baby, your photograph must be there, but Arvind is a different person.
They only kept Anna's photo which was not a small tyaag (sacrifice). I don't think there can be any other person in this world who could have done that and it is because of that the Jan Lokpal andolan became Anna andolan.
Nobody said it was Arvind's movement, it was Anna's movement. The wording of the bill was his, for its legal language it was given to Prashantji (Bhushan), Shanti Bhushanji and various other luminaries like (former Delhi high court chief justice Rajinder) Sacharji etc...
Then Arvind thought of doing the July 25 fast for 10 days. I was the only doctor with him. During their fast, the medical responsibility was always mine. I will never forget those 10 days and later those 15 days, they really tested me.
 They are a diabetic. A diabetic person needs to have meals at regular intervals, regulated diet, medicines have to be taken on time, but since they were in public life, they could never manage that.
I thought it was suicide for a diabetic to go on hunger strike. I fought with them against it, but they didn't listen.
When they make up their mind, nobody on earth can make Arvind change it.
Their zeal, their passion towards their goal... people nowadays make fun of them and point out their mistakes, but the reality is that these people haven't seen their sacrifice.
If you understand their commitment towards this country, you will not dare say anything against him.
When they were fasting, I told him, 'Do you think anyone will support your family if anything happens to you?'
When they left the IRS and got into social service, their relatives used to blame him. Everyone used to remind them that they have a family.
On the third day of the fast, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital doctors advised that they should be hospitalised. A DGP (director general of police) phoned and warned us not to get admitted in the hospital as doctors can be very timid.
I was in a fix -- such seniors doctors from RML advising immediate hospitalisation, while Arvind saying that they are fit.
There were other volunteer doctors and 450 people on fast along with Arvind, Manish Sisodia and Gopal Rai. The doctors said with the ketone levels at 3 plus, they should be hospitalised.
I said but they don't want to and clinically they seem to be fine. Arvind relies more on naturopathy and Ayurveda. They were so confident that nothing would happen to him.
I had no other option. We were volunteers there to help Arvind's movement, not merely doctors. They carried on for another week, but believe me it was a very trying time.
The journalists covering the fast used to say 'Doctorsaab, are you sure? Your whole career is at stake. If anything happens to Arvind you will lose your registration, put in jail because the government doctors had advised immediate hospitalisation.'
But working with Arvind all these years, we had this thing in us -- not to go just by the book.
It was Friday afternoon and I told Arvind bahut ho gaya, sarkar toh sun hi nahin rahi hain (it's enough, the government is not paying heed) so what's the use? They said some prominent people have written a letter that now a political option will have to be given. The announcement of the letter will be made at 5 pm.
They said we'll keep this in front of the janta and give it two days to decide. If people say andolan, then we'll continue -- chahey jaan chali jaye (even if I have to sacrifice my life) but if they say a political alternative, then we'll think of forming a party.
But before that we came to know that Anna had announced. It was Anna who announced this talk of the letter about prominent people writing about a political alternate.
That wasn't the way Arvind had wanted it. They had wanted a referendum. Prashant Bhushan and Sanjay Singh, who were sitting on the dais, were thunder-struck. Arvind was equally disturbed.
When Anna came down, Arvind went to talk to them and Anna asked maine kuch galat kiya? (did I make a mistake?)
I am a student of pure science who has never bowed down or folded my hands before God. I am an atheist.
I have been to jhuggies with him. I've seen them being humiliated by their relatives. I have seen their life and politics was never in their mind at that time.
There are certain things that have to be understood. I have seen Arvind's sacrifice closely. I know what their thought process is like. I have full faith in him. They have never wanted anything for himself.
Those who don't know them can view them however they want to. I am also Arvind's greatest critic.
They got married when they were in IRS training in Nagpur, they had a colleague who used to listen to both them and bhabhi, and they told them that your thoughts are alike.
In the 2011 August andolan, they transferred bhabhi and the house had to be vacated. Myself with Arvind's parents, we roamed in Kaushambi for 10 days for a rented flat, not a single banda (Person) was willing to give a house on rent.
When the AAP was formed, no one was ready to give us office space because we never used to have the money. I had a vacant flat which I gave them.
The reality is -- trust me -- that we have not done anything. People call our (medical) profession noble, but it is a means to earn our living, its side effect may be noble but we haven't come for nobility.
Because of Arvind I found something that my profession could never give me. I have never practiced like other doctors and perhaps that is what brought Arvind to me.
I can bask in the glory and joy of what this andolan gave me.
When Americans reach for their Bibles, more than half of them pick up a King James Version (KJV), according to a new study advised by respected historian Mark Noll.
The 55 percent who read the KJV easily outnumber the 19 percent who read the New International Version (NIV). And the percentages drop into the single digits for competitors such as the New Revised Standard Version, New America Bible, and the Living Bible.
So concludes "The Bible in American Life," a lengthy report by the Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Funded by the Lilly Foundation, researchers asked questions on what David Briggs of the ARDA, which first reported the results, calls "two of the most highly respected data sources for American religion"—the General Social Survey and the National Congregations Study.
The numbers are surprising, given the strong sales of NIV translations in bookstores. The NIV has ...

RIAA Wants Google & Google Chrome to Filter Piracy Websites RIAA boss Cary Sherman yesterday spoke before a House Judiciary Subcommittee to push for additional anti-piracy countermeasures, including requiring that Google implement filters into their Chrome browser. Sherman's testimony (pdf) starts off by praising the new ISP copyright alert system, though noting it's a work in progress with no evidence it's doing much of anything: quote: The CAS is still in the initial implementation stages and proper metrics are being determined. But feedback so far has been positive and it is worth noting that P2P content protection programs in other countries have been found to have an impact on either the amount of unauthorized P2P activity or on sales.
quote: If ISPs can be considered the gateway by users to rogue sites online, search engines may be considered the roadmaps or, more directly, the turn-by-turn directions and door-to-door service to these sites. There can be no doubt that search engines play a considerable role in leading users to illicit services and can be a key part of addressing infringing activity online. Except as quote: Google has tools in its Chrome browser to warn users if they are going to sites that may be malicious. Shouldn't that technology be used to warn users of rogue sites? Or better yet, can Google use similar technology to highlight or identify sites that are authorized? Imagine if links to content on legitimate sites were labeled – directly in the search result –with a certification mark indicating that the site is licensed and actually pays royalties to creators. That educational message could have a profound and positive impact on user behavior... Most should probably understand how this idea will likely break far more than it fixes, creating cumbersome layers of ugly in the process. Many worried that as the entertainment industry's copyright alert system (aka "six strikes") floundered, the industry would very quickly come out with even worse ideas. That time has apparently arrived. Except data suggests CAS isn't doing much to reduce piracy traffic here in the States , and a recent study out of Australia suggests similar programs aren't working well internationally, either. Undaunted, Sherman goes on to place much of the blame for piracy squarely at the feet of Google:Except as the MPAA's own data shows , pulling these websites from search results won't accomplish much, as the major engines don't drive as much traffic to specific pirated content as one might think (most pirates already know where to go). What does appear to work? Offering quality, inexpensive, legitimate alternatives to piracy .Still, the RIAA focuses their attention squarely on Google, insisting the company should embed functionality in their search engine and Chrome browser that warns users about pirate websites in the same way they're warned of malware:Most should probably understand how this idea will likely break far more than it fixes, creating cumbersome layers of ugly in the process. Many worried that as the entertainment industry's copyright alert system (aka "six strikes") floundered, the industry would very quickly come out with even worse ideas. That time has apparently arrived.

Why an Android Laptop is a Great Idea. No, Really!
By Mike Elgan
Misleading and misunderstanding blogging and reporting this week is leading everybody into falsely believing that Intel plans to ship or support Android-based laptops.
This has sparked debate over the wisdom or folly of Android laptops.
I'll make a case for why Android laptops are a great idea, but first let's kill the myth that Intel announced Android laptops.
As far as I can tell, the false idea originated with a C|net interview of Dadi Perlmutter, Intel executive VP and chief product officer. The misconception wasn't C|net's fault — their report was good. In that piece, Pearlmutter intended to point out that $200 laptops were coming, and that they expected that most of them would be Android devices, rather than Windows 8 machines.
Also: They were talking about Intel's role as a chip and chipset maker, rather than a laptop maker and seller as some blogs have falsely assumed.
C|net speculated, I think accurately, that these so-called “laptops” would really be Windows 8 style machines — touch tablets with an optional detachable keyboard cover. That's not a laptop.
A laptop is a clamshell device with a non-detachable keyboard that connects with wires, rather than wirelessly, and gets electrical power from the main battery, not separate batteries or solar power.
As far as I know, no one, neither Intel nor any other company, has announced Android laptops.
But they should do. Android laptops are a great idea.
The critics of the Android laptop idea fall into two camps. The first camp says we don't need Android laptops because that's what ChromeOS is for. But ChromeOS isn't about the clamshell form-factor, but the cloud-computing concept. Cloud-only computing makes sense for certain types of users, but nobody can deny the compelling advantage of the Play Store, and also of a laptop that's familiar to and fully compatible with one's phone. (More on that below.)
The second camp says the clamshell form-factor is a lousy one for touch computing. You have to reach over to touch the screen and you get gorilla arm and other phony medical conditions. This is just the human monkey-mind trying to grasp yet another new idea. Remember when everyone was freaking out over the smudges left on the iPad, or the unacceptability of using an onscreen, rather than a physical, keyboard? Remember when everyone got carpal-tunnel syndrome from using a mouse in the 1990s? People react in irrational ways to new ways of doing things, then later they forget about it.
The “gorilla arm” idea is just the paleolithic human mind failing to embrace a new idea. I can assure you that desktop touch computing is coming and five years from now nobody will remember “gorilla arm.”
Why the Laptop Touch Laptop Idea Is a Good One
I have two tablets, a big iPad and a small Nexus, and also a laptop (a MacBook Pro). If I were to estimate usage, I would say I use the laptop 40% of the time and the Nexus about 10% of the time. I use the iPad about half the time. But here's the thing: When I use the iPad and Nexus, I tend to use them like laptops.
I use an Apple Bluetooth keyboard, prop them up so the tablet is at a laptop angle, and use a combination of keystrokes and touch gestures to do my work and/or play.
(The reason I use the iPad more than the Nexus is because it has a larger screen and a case that props it up. If the sizes were reversed — if I had a Nexus 10 and an iPad mini — I'd use the Nexus more.)
Here's the thing: I gain so much benefit from the use of a full-size, physical keyboard that if I had to choose I would much rather have an Android laptop (with keyboard permanently attached) than never using a keyboard.
A bona fide Android laptop would actually be something of a benefit. The Apple keyboard I use runs on AA batteries, which I have to remove each time I turn it off (It turns itself on in my backpack because of the awkward placement of the button). And I always have to carry and think about batteries.
I'd love a tablet with a keyboard that sucked power from the main battery. (I've owned solar powered wireless keyboards before, and had bad experiences with them.)
That's just my experience. The larger point is that my experiences don't matter. I think an Android keyboard makes sense for a lot of other types of users.
Why Tech Pundits' Criticism of Android Laptops Can Be Ignored
I'm tired of tech pundits assuming that every user is like them. Guess what? Some people aren't tech bloggers and writers.
Imagine if Hollywood made movies only about Hollywood. Imagine if every song was about the life of songwriters.
That's what the tech punditsphere is like — it pretends like there is no reality except their reality.
It's time for tech writers to stop being so self-referential and realize that there are other kinds of people besides themselves.
First of all, most tech writers today started out using PCs, and only later started using phones, then smartphones.
But for nearly all kids these days, and an increasing number of adults around the world, the first “computer” in their life is an Android smartphone.
More to the point, there are small business people all over the world who actually run their businesses from an Android phone. They do billing, inventory, payroll, marketing and all business communication using Android apps. As businesses grow, people start hiring people and upgrading to computers that are used in an office or in some other location that involves a table of some kind.
Most business-related work is keyboard-intensive communication, data entry, billing and so on.
Why should these small business people suffer the indignities and needless cost of using Windows PCs?
Why should they have to abandon their apps and move to ChromeOS?
Why should they have to sell their children to buy a MacBook?
Why should they have to learn something new? Why not just buy Android laptops and keep using the apps that are already serving the company well?
My point is that for millions of people around the world, Android is the only operating system they know or want or need. Yet the clamshell laptop form-factor is a compelling one for all of us.
These are third-world problems. Let's talk about the first-world kind.
Hardware is cheap. So people like to have various devices around the house and for highly specific uses. For example, an Android touch tablet is a great device to use with no keyboard while watching TV. But what about the kitchen?
At $200, what's the downside of buying an Android laptop for use on the kitchen counter? It's function could be to pipe in TV, movies and music, enable hangouts with friends while making lasagna, and using some of the many killer cooking and kitchen apps in the Play Store. A kitchen Android laptop would be far superior and more convenient than a conventional Android tablet.
There are some people who aren't technical, don't want to experiment with the endless variety of apps in the Play Store, but just want to write. Novelists, screenwriters, poets. Millions of people use their computers to communicate and write, on social networks and so on. An Android laptop is a perfect device. You clamshell it opens and go to work with the keyboard.
Sometimes businesses need a computer that does only one simple thing. For example, there are many companies where visitors need a badge. They need some device in the lobby where people type in their name and who they're meeting with, then a printer cranks out the badge. An Android laptop is the perfect solution for this, and thousands of other dedicated-computer applications.
I could go on and on, and would do if I were paid by the word. The point is that there are all kinds of user types and all kinds of reasons why bona fide Android laptops make sense.
But the biggest reason of all is that Android should lend itself to a gazillion form factors. Android should be the anti-iOS — the free, open, anything-goes platform where choice and variety and flexibility provide a total alternative to Apple's simple and integrated but ultimately locked-down iOS platform.
In addition to smartphones and touch tablets, we should have Android based watches, glasses, phablets, ATMs, car dashboards, smart refrigerators and, yes, even laptops. Why not?
Intel isn't building or announcing real Android laptops. But somebody should build them.
The Android laptop idea is overdue. I think somebody should build one.

First Shugo announced them at RubyKaigi. Then Matz showed some improved syntax at RubyConf. But what are refinements all about, and what would they be used for?
The first thing you need to understand is that the purpose of refinements in Ruby 2.0 is to make monkey-patching safer. Specifically, the goal is to make it possible to extend core classes, but to limit the effect of those extensions to a particular area of code. Since the purpose of this feature is make monkey-patching safer, let's take a look at a dangerous case of monkey-patching and see how this new feature would improve the situation.
A few months ago, I encountered a problem where some accidental monkey-patches in Right::AWS conflicted with Rails' own monkey-patches. In particular, here is their code:
unless defined? ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions class String #:nodoc: def camelize() self.dup.split(/_/).map{ |word| word.capitalize }.join('') end end end
Essentially, Right::AWS is trying to make a few extensions available to itself, but only if they were not defined by Rails. In that case, they assume that the Rails version of the extension will suffice. They did this quite some time ago, so these extensions represent a pretty old version of Rails. They assume (without any real basis), that every future version of ActiveSupport will return an expected vaue from camelize.
Unfortunately, Rails 3 changed the internal organization of ActiveSupport, and removed the constant name ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions. As a result, these monkey-patches got activated. Let's take a look at what the Rails 3 version of the camelize helper looks like:
class String def camelize(first_letter = :upper) case first_letter when :upper then ActiveSupport::Inflector.camelize(self, true) when :lower then ActiveSupport::Inflector.camelize(self, false) end end end module ActiveSupport module Inflector extend self def camelize(lower_case_and_underscored_word, first_letter_in_uppercase = true) if first_letter_in_uppercase lower_case_and_underscored_word.to_s.gsub(/\/(.?)/) { "::#{$1.upcase}" }.gsub(/(?:^|_)(.)/) { $1.upcase } else lower_case_and_underscored_word.to_s[0].chr.downcase + camelize(lower_case_and_underscored_word)[1..-1] end end
There are a few differences here, but the most important one is that in Rails, "foo/bar" becomes "Foo::Bar". The Right::AWS version converts that same input into "Foo/bar".
Now here's the wrinkle. The Rails router uses camelize to convert controller paths like "admin/posts" to "Admin::Posts". Because Right::AWS overrides camelize with this (slightly) incompatible implementation, the Rails router ends up trying to find an "Admin/posts" constant, which Ruby correctly complains isn't a valid constant name. While situations like this are rare, it's mostly because of an extremely diligent library community, and a general eschewing of applying these kinds of monkey-patches in library code. In general, Right::AWS should have done something like Right::Utils.camelize in their code to avoid this problem.
Refinements allow us to make these kinds of aesthetically pleasing extensions for our own code with the guarantee that they will not affect any other Ruby code.
First, instead of directly reopening the String class, we would create a refinement in the ActiveSupport module:
module ActiveSupport refine String do def camelize(first_letter = :upper) case first_letter when :upper then ActiveSupport::Inflector.camelize(self, true) when :lower then ActiveSupport::Inflector.camelize(self, false) end end
What we have done here is defined a String refinement that we can activate elsewhere with the using method. Let's use the refinement in the router:
module ActionDispatch module Routing class RouteSet using ActiveSupport def controller_reference(controller_param) unless controller = @controllers[controller_param] controller_name = "#{controller_param.camelize}Controller" controller = @controllers[controller_param] = ActiveSupport::Dependencies.ref(controller_name) end controller.get end end
It's important to note that the refinement only applies to methods physically inside the same block. It will not apply to other methods in ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet defined in a different block. This means that we can use different refinements for different groups of methods in the same class, by defining the methods in different class blocks, each with their own refinements. So if I reopened the RouteSet class somewhere else:
module ActionDispatch module Routing class RouteSet using RouterExtensions # I can define a special version of camelize that will be used # only in methods defined in this physical block def route_name(name) name.camelize end end
Getting back to the real-life example, even though Right::AWS created a global version of camelize, the ActiveSupport version (applied via using ActiveSupport ) will be used. This means that we are guaranteed that our code (and only our code) uses the special version of camelize.
It's also important to note that only explicit calls to camelize in the physical block will use the special version. For example, let's imagine that some library defines a global method called constantize, and uses a camelize refinement:
module Protection refine String do def camelize() self.dup.split(/_/).map{ |word| word.capitalize }.join('') end end end class String #:nodoc: using Protection def constantize Object.module_eval("::#{camelize}", __FILE__, __LINE__) end end
Calling String#constantize anywhere will internally call the String#camelize from the Protection refinement to do some of its work. Now let's say we create a String refinement with an unusual camelize method:
module Wycats refine String do def camelize result = dup.split(/_/).map(&:capitalize).join "_#{result}_" end end end module Factory using Wycats def self.create(class_name, string) klass = class_name.constantize klass.new(string.camelize) end end class Person def initialize(string) @string = string end end Factory.create("Person", "wycats")
Here, the Wycats refinement should not leak into the call to constantize . If it did, it would mean that any call into any method could leak a refinement into that method, which is the opposite of the purpose of the feature. Once you realize that refinements apply lexically, they create a very orderly, easy to understand way to apply targeted monkey patches to an area of code.
In my opinion, the most important feature of refinements is that you can see the refinements that apply to a chunk of code (delineated by a physical class body). This allows you to be sure that the changes you are making only apply where you want them to apply, and makes refinements a real solution to the general problem of wanting aesthetically pleasing extensions with the guarantee that you can't break other code. In addition, refinements protect diligent library authors even when other library authors (or app developers) make global changes, which makes it possible to use the feature without system-wide adoption. I, for one, am I looking forward to it.
Postscript
As many of you may remember from last week, SBNation and Hyundai wanted you, the fan, to tell your story about what made you the biggest College Football fan of them all. And we had some great entries. However, there was one that stood out pretty well among the entries.
If I said the name Paul Favela, many of you may not know what the hell I'm speaking of. But, if I used the term "Husker Hombre", you'll realize what I speak of quicker. A staple at home and away Nebraska Football games, Paul is far from home, as Victoria, Texas is a good 7 hours south of my home in the DFW area, which is 10 hours south of Lincoln. Imagine that drive home every holiday break.
But, to tell their story, I'll let Paul give it to you. I can't simply do it justice at all. Here's Paul in their own words.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sombrevolution
I wasn't born into Husker fandom, although I wish I was. At least then I would have some recollection of the "glory days", the national championships, etc. . My parents were never big college football fans, having attended a small college in Kingsville, Tx. Where I grew up you only had two choices regarding college football teams, Aggies or Longhorns. Although I loved college football, over the seventeen years I lived in Texas I never felt a connection to any school in Texas. When it was time to choose a university, I figured I basically just go to a school in Texas, get through it, and simply move on with my life. Until one piece of mail changed my life completely. The University of Nebraska offered the greatest opportunity I had ever been presented with. At first the idea seemed like a joke to my parents considering we live 1000 miles away. But Nebraska offered everything I could have imagined. Affordable schooling, an opportunity to attend Dental School, and all of the college football I could handle! I was committed.
When I arrived on campus to enroll, the first thing I did was find the stadium. Although it was locked, I took pictures, set my phone's wallpaper, and started the countdown to football season. My first Husker game was one of the most amazing experiences of life, while at the same time one of the most exhausting. Still recovering from a self induced sickness from the night before that many college freshmen tend experience their first few weekends on campus, my newly made friends had to wake me up to get me to the game. I was so dazed that I nearly forgot the hat my mom had made for me before I left Texas. Not knowing my way around the stadium, my friends and I ran about three times the distance we needed to get to our seats(by that time I was about ready to puke). Of course Marlon Lucky had a HUGE game against Nevada, we won handedly, and the season never looked so good. On top of that, I was officially hooked on Husker football.
The first time I slept in front of the stadium was my first-year student year when Gameday came to town for the USC game. I've never shivered that much in my life. When Gameday was over, I ate lunch and headed back to the stadium for the 7pm primetime kick off. By the fourth quarter, my roommate and I were the only ones left in our row. They told me "Real Husker Fans stay to the end of the game, no matter what…". Once again, I've never shivered so much in my life. Anyway… We'll just skip through the rest of that season. Sound good? Okay.
About halfway into my undergrad career I found my sombrero. As I explained in my first post it was a slow progression of ideas that ultimately what lead to the "Husker Hombre". But before the Husker Hombre could come alive I had to clear a major hurdle of my life. I had come to Nebraska for three things: College Football, Meeting new friends, and dental school. I had completed two out of three of those by the start of my senior year. I interviewed at four schools: two Texas schools, Iowa, and Nebraska. Three years of late nights, stressing over exams, and working all week with the promise of a Husker Gameday on Saturdays finally paid off. I was accepted to all four schools and again was faced with a decision. Four years of college costs money. Four extra year of out of state professional schooling costs even more than that. Although moving back to Texas would have been substantially cheaper(tens of thousands of dollars cheaper) and Iowa had offered a great deal of financial aid to leave Nebraska, you can't put a price how happy I am to be a cornhusker. Four more years of UNL(technically UNMC), four more years of Husker football student tickets, four more years of the good life.
Since I first started wearing my Husker Hombre gameday gear, I've been entirely astonished by the amount of positive feedback and attention that it receives. Only a few weeks into the season I was already finding myself on a variety of internet websites with positive comments all over the place. At some point somebody even made a facebook page for me… and it had fans!(I'm now an admin on the Husker Hombre FB page). I couldn't stop laughing when I first saw it. I didn't think anyone really paid attention to the crowd/student section. I started to realize that maybe I have an opportunity to do more than just look ridiculous and make a few people smile on gameday. I have the opportunity to represent the Huskers every day, bring positive attention to the student section, and show the college football world why Nebraska is home of the Greatest fans in college football… and there's not much that I love more than that.
This season, a few of my friends decided to join me in gearing up for gamedays. One of them dresses like Kenny Bell(with their blue practice shirt and afro), the other two wear self-made red deadmau5 helmets. A girl that sits with our group asked if they could dress like a taco and stand next to me. I told them I would extremely disappoint if they didn't do so haha. And this type of thing is exactly what I hope happens. Would I be disappointed if the entire student section dressed up crazy and showed up to the games and I instead just blended in? Of course not! We would have the undisputed most crazy student section in college football. Would I be disappointed if I was the quietest person in the stadium? Of course not! Everytime the opposing teams offense takes the field I hope they can feel the ground shake from the noise Memorial Stadium makes. And would I be disappointed if somebody told me that I'm not the biggest fan in college football, let alone Husker Football? Of course not. While I strive to be the best fan I can be, I take pride in knowing college football has the best fans of any sport in the world. Add that to Nebraska having the best fans in college football… well I guess you can make the connection. I'm not the most knowledgeable fan, I'm not the oldest fan, and I don't have any money to donate to the athletic department(yet…). But I do everything I can to help the school that has done so much to help me. One day when I look back on the impact(no matter how small) I've had on my alma mater, I'll take pride in knowing it was a positive one. Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice.
My goal has always been to do everything I can do to help our team win and show the nation the opportunity Nebraska has to offer. When I started all those years ago, I was just a guy in a funny hat screaming their lungs out… and I still am. Except now I do my best to take it one step further. Ultimately if one recruit sees me in the student section and my Husker support can sway them by .01% to come to Nebraska, then I've accomplished my goal. If people see me looking ridiculous on tv and think "Nebraska has some dedicated fans…" then I've done my job. I've got two more years of student tickets after this season… although the Hombre will likely fade away, I hope there's a crazier student to replace me.
***Current Hombre/Fun Facts
• I actually almost wasn't allowed in the stadium the first game I wore my Husker Hombre outfit because my "hat was too big and is therefore considered an umbrella" . Everyone at the gate came to my defense and they let me in… I switched hats next game to avoid the hassle.
• The original Big Sombrero took 2 hours to sew "Husker" into the hat.
• I eat at Grandmother's(Restaurant) and listen to the pep band before every home game with all my best friends.
• I start growing the mustache exactly 100 days before the season begins… I'll shave it after the bowl game.
• I have Gameday socks, shoes, shirts, corn, sunglasses, jacket, belt, and boxers. Always the same every home-game.
• I usually get to the stadium at about 1am(even if the game is at 7pm)
• I've slept outside the stadium for every game this season
• I won't miss a home game for any reason( I told my brother when they were planning their wedding that It wouldn't be my fault if they planned it on a Gameday and I didn't show up… Hooray Summer Weddings!)
• I actually get better sleep in a sleeping bag outside the stadium on the ground than I normally do during the rest of week/year
• My mom actually made the jacket I wear as part of my Husker Hombre get-up.
• I wear red/black/white all season regardless of the occasion
• I will never say no to a picture… Even if we lose… Even with the opposing team's fans.
• I am always 100% astonished that any random person would want to take a picture with me haha
• I often scream so hard at games that I become light headed and nearly pass out… I usually can't talk very well the next day.
• When we lost to Texas(and Dan Beebe) in the Big 12 championship game I yelled so loud and got so angry that my nose started bleeding… Husker Red of course.
• I haven't been able to travel to away games as much as I would like because I was busy keeping my GPA up to get into dental school all through undergrad and nowadays I have to study just as much just to stay in dental school.
Places I've been:
1. Colorado(drove)
2. Texas Bowl (Bowl Crashing)(To celebrate our Holiday Bowl victory from the previous day)
3. Kansas State(drove)
4. Iowa State vs. Texas Tech(watching a friend on a bye week)(drove)
5. Ohio State(The first and only Husker Hombre away game) (Also we drove… 13 hours. And another 13 hours to get back… in one weekend) I stayed until the end… The cold, cold, end of the game… Btw, Ohio State sells hot chocolate… for 9 DOLLARS! No thanks.
• I have every ticket from every game I've ever been to in a safe place
• I only buy clothes that are red, black, or white
• The Husker Hombre has never said "no" to anyone asking for pictures, stories, writings, etc… I always feel so special haha.(I also always make sure it's a pro-NU piece)
• I would pay money to have Bo Pelini scream in my face whenever I do poorly on exams
• Now this one is kind of ridiculous sounding… I've been with my girlfriend for just over 2 years now and they were mentioning engagement over the Summer. So I did what every other normal college football fan/man would do… Made it contingent on the upcoming football season. I told them I would propose if the Huskers either won 10 games or made it to a Rose Bowl(Won the B1G championship). They said "Now I'm going to be freaking out about every game all week!". I told them "Welcome to my life, Megan." Every so often she'll jokingly say "I don't think you even want to get engaged…" to which I reply "No Megan… you have no idea how much I want to get engaged to you. But that's not up to me… It's up to Taylor Martinez right now.

A trip to North Korea
On your arrival at the airport you need to leave your cellphone, no roaming service is avaliable but if you select an operator manually you get PRK 03 although they never saw a single person with a cell-phone. Laptops are allowed it seems that north koreans are not aware of cards that can make your laptop to work like a cellphone.
The only house where a foreigner will be ever allowed on their visit. It's a model-house of a model-farmworker of a model-collective farm. There is even something that looks like a computer made of components that are not even plugged together. Internet does not exist, only intranet is avalaible.
On your arrival you will be assigned to a guide and a driver. That will constantly follow you. You can't leave the hotel on your own. The daily program consists of 2-3 visits to a landmark. In the hotel you can watch BBC,NTV (russian chan),and a couple of chinese channels, so you can't really complain about freedom of speech. The food is good, and you can't complain about that either. In a park they saw elder women picking up herbs, the guide said that it was for the rabbits, although it was clear that it was the kind of herb that the "owners of the rabbits" could eat.
Kiosk that sells foreign product to tourists, as in snickers chinese sprite and lays from 2001. You have to chose your product pay at a sepate booth get a checkstub and give it to the merchant to get your purchase.
Kiosk for locals, most of the time they sell lemonade, forigers are given a plastic cup, locals get porcelain mugs, that are washed in a bucket of water after use.
Sometimes you see people selling some kind of vegetable, that was taken next to a fruits and veggies store, they immediatly closed the door as they saw a tourist.
North Koreans are always amazed when they see a white man.
The plaster statues are clean and not broken apart. North Korea is a perfect reproduction of the year 1950.
They still havent figured out how to make flat glass withtout bubbles, the only exception are the windows in the hotel or large vitrines.
Oil is almost inexistant, so most of the labor is manual.
Water seems not to be avaliable everywhere when you leave the capital. A woman is washing their clothes in the river.
Life in a village
When building in a city they tend to block the old houses with tall bulidings , if that is not possible they put a concrete fence so you would only see the roof.
As soon as you try to take a picture different from the magazine "Korea" the guide will say: "why are you taking a picture" "it's forbidden here"
Koreans are not shy when it comes to basic needs, the guide forbid to take pictures of men taking a piss on the middle of the road, but there was no problem when it happened in the capital next to to a monument (look at the guy on the steps)
The big monument, (they cut off the electricity at 11)
The city at night is scary, there is no light on the streets and people use white lights and no curtains.
during the day the elevator didn't work for 15 mins
View from the monument, besides the pretty view you can also see the dead birds.
Reality of the NK, a forigner will not see this generally.
The whole Pyongyang is like this, when they asked the guide about the old houses the guide said that old people didn't want to move out in the new ones and like it that way

Abstinence-Only Education Is Ineffective And Unethical, Report Argues
Enlarge this image toggle caption PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou/Getty Images PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou/Getty Images
Abstaining from sexual activity is a surefire way to prevent pregnancy and avoid sexually transmitted diseases. But programs advocating abstinence often fail to prevent young people from having sex, researchers write in the September issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health.
Such programs, sometimes referred to as "abstinence only until marriage" programs, typically advocate monogamous, heterosexual marriage as the only appropriate context for sexual intercourse and as the only certain way to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.
That's "not just unrealistic, but it leaves our young people without the information and skills that they need," said Laura Lindberg, a coauthor of the report and a research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights. "We fail our young people when we don't provide them with complete and medically accurate information."
The analysis confirms previous public health findings that abstinence-only education programs don't succeed in reducing rates of teen pregnancies or STDs. Moreover, public health data indicate that such programs "have little demonstrated efficacy in helping adolescents to delay intercourse," the authors write.
When American teens do begin having sex, they may fail to use condoms or other forms of contraception, unlike their peers in other countries who have routine access to contraceptive education and counseling, the report suggests.
Promoting abstinence until marriage as the only legitimate option for young people "violates medical ethics and harms young people," Lindberg says, because such programs generally withhold information about pregnancy and STD prevention and overstate the risk of contraceptive failure.
According to a 2004 report prepared for House Democrats, language used in abstinence-based curricula often reinforces "gender stereotypes about female passivity and male aggressiveness" — attitudes that often correlate with harmful outcomes including domestic violence, the report notes.
The new analysis argues there's another reason that abstinence until marriage is increasingly unrealistic: Americans are marrying later, on average, and some are not marrying at all, but they're not waiting longer to begin having sex. The average age for initiating sexual activity has remained around 17 or 18 since the early 1990s. The net effect, the report concludes, is a substantial increase in premarital sex.
Conservative groups have long advocated abstinence education in public schools, pointing to a smaller number of studies that support abstinence-based approaches. Reacting to the report, Concerned Women for America CEO Penny Nance noted that abstinence is the only 100 percent effective form of birth control.
"It seems we have swung so far left as to embrace promiscuity for our kids," Nance said in a statement to NPR. "And at the least, we are surrendering to the idea that teenagers will be sexually active. We, as a culture, can do better."
Nance added, "Schools and public health advocates owe it to parents and people of faith to support the young girl or boy who wants to delay sexual behavior. Marriage, and delaying sex until at least adulthood, are good goals."
The U.S. government has funded abstinence programs in schools and community organizations since the early 1980s. An increased focus on and funding for them began as part of welfare reform efforts undertaken during the Clinton administration. According to Guttmacher, the federal government has spent about $2 billion over the past 20 years on abstinence-based education.
President Trump has also been friendly to such programs, naming Valerie Huber, an advocate for abstinence-only education, to a post at the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration recently cut more than $200 million in federal funds for teen pregnancy prevention programs. Meanwhile, the administration's budget proposal includes millions of dollars to extend the "Abstinence Education and Personal Responsibility Education Program."
That approach pleases much of Trump's conservative base. In a statement to NPR, Arina Grossu, director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council, said abstinence-based programs "provide the optimal message for teens." They compared the approach to "other public health models used to address underage drinking and drug use" that aim to discourage such behaviors.
Guttmacher's Lindberg takes the comparison in a different direction in arguing that teens should be given comprehensive sex education that includes training in contraception and STD prevention.
"We tell people not to drink and drive," they say. "We don't teach them not to drive. ... We would never withhold information about seat belts because they wouldn't know how to protect themselves."

The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati denied a request Wednesday from a Kentucky court clerk to stay a federal injunction that called on them to provide marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
Judges found that "it cannot be defensibly argued that the holder of the Rowan County Clerk's Office, apart from who personally occupies that office, may decline to act in conformity with the United States Constitution," especially after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. They said that Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, whose office is in Moorehead, Ky., had little or no likelihood of prevailing on appeal in their official capacity.
Citing personal religious objections against gay marriage, Davis has denied licenses to all couples following the June Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide.
In testimony last month in federal court in Covington, Ky., Davis described themselves as an Apostolic Christian who believes marriage is defined as the union of one man and one woman under the Bible — “God's holy word” — and said they contemplated their policy for months.
The American Civil Liberties Union had sued them on behalf of two same-sex couples and two opposite-sex couples, alleging that Davis violated their constitutional rights when refusing to issue licenses.
The couples argued that they live, work and pay taxes in Rowan County, a county of about 24,000 residents halfway between Lexington, Ky., and Huntington, W.Va., and shouldn't have to drive elsewhere to obtain the paperwork to get married.
U.S. District Judge David Bunning granted a preliminary injunction against Davis this month, finding that their religious convictions do not excuse them from performing official duties and upholding their oath of office.
Dan Canon, a lawyer representing couples who wish to obtain a license in Rowan County, said their clients in theory should be allowed to obtain the paperwork immediately.
"It's not terribly surprising," they said about Wednesday's order. "It's correct and yet another reaffirmation that clerks have to abide by the rule of law just like everybody else.”
Some county officials in Southern states — including Cleburne County Clerk Dana Guffey in Heber Springs, Ark.; Decatur County Clerk Gwen Pope and two others in Decaturville, Tenn.; and Rusk County Clerk Joyce Lewis-Kugle in Henderson, Texas — have resigned rather than issue licenses to same-sex couples. Alabama law says county probate judges in the state "may" issue marriage licenses, so some counties there have ceased providing the service.
The Liberty Counsel, a religious freedom organization representing Davis, plans to request a stay from Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan as early as Thursday.
Mat Staver, founder and chairperson of the group, said lawyers also will seek clarification from the District Court on whether Davis must personally issue licenses or if someone else in their office can perform the task. They said they didn't know if Davis would resume providing the forms Thursday but called it "disturbing" that the appellate judges cast doubt on their appeal.
"It suggests that individuals within a government agency don't have any independent constitutional rights," they said. "They don't lose their constitutional or statutory rights by virtue of working in a public office."
Davis has argued that signing off on the forms amounts to condoning same-sex marriage and that their objections are protected under the First Amendment and Kentucky's religious freedom law.
Bunning originally wrote that the state is not restricting their religious activities nor asking them to condone the unions, and they said their beliefs have no bearing on a “purely legal” task. Bunning wrote that the couples have strong ties to their community and an understandable preference to obtain the paperwork there.
Couples have made several attempts to get the forms in Rowan County, and at least four were refused after Bunning issued an injunction. Bunning had stayed their injunction pending Davis' appeal to the 6th Circuit.
Canon said they would expect Kagan to agree with the appellate judges.
The Liberty Counsel "will very likely use every procedural avenue that they have available to them," they said.

In Shanghai, there are a lot of bikes.. a LOT of bikes. With the high costs of car ownership, heavy pollution and traffic congestion, bikes are still a great alternative and you can quickly get around the city. However, bikes are still generally considered to be the poor-man's machine – and as the economy grows and people's income increases, people are ditching their bikes for scooters, e-bikes and automobiles. Problem is, bikes and pedestrians are the bottom of the food chain. The only traffic enforcement you will see in Shanghai is to keep pedestrians out of the way of the automobiles. The single goal is to keep cars moving as quickly as possible. In Shanghai, cars always have the right-of-way. Even if you have a “walk” signal – which indicates the “right-of-way” in North America – don't be fooled into thinking you have the right-of-way. You need to wait for a gap in cars – even though they are passing through a red light – and you need to run to avoid slowing down automobile traffic. The consequence of not doing so? At best, you will be brushed by a fast-moving automobile. Fortunately, the traffic engineers have recognized this potential conflict between cyclists and automobiles, so they have provided many barrier-protected cycle tracks for bicycles and scooters, automobile-free streets as well as bike-free streets.

Shanghai also has designated bike parking lots everywhere. There are lines painted on the sidewalk to indicate where bikes should be parked.

The following photo is from 6AM on a Saturday morning – so the bike parking lot is expectedly empty:

But don't kid yourself – these bike parking lots are completely full on weekdays and most are full on weekends too. This photo is from Friday afternoon:

But perhaps more interesting is the idea of having a “handicap” bike parking spot. I have never seen anything like this in North America, and I'm not sure if they have these in Europe.
But why not? Why shouldn't a handicapped person ride a bike or a scooter? Unless they are in a wheelchair, many handicapped people I know could still ride a bike or a scooter. It's nice to see the Shanghai government has provided a space for these people as well as everyone else to park their bikes.

What really fascinates me about the cycling in China is what the future holds. The economy in China is growing at a phenomenal rate. People's wealth will continue to increase and the temptation to use automobiles will threaten these cities just like they did in Europe and North America when car became king in the decades following World War II.
Big cities in China will hit a threshold where they may start to see bikes as an effective and pragmatic tool rather than simply using them because that's all they can afford. Or if the government isn't careful, China could simply turn into the United States. They could rip out the existing cycle paths to make more room for automobiles and then the great Chinese cities will be nothing more than big American cities.
At least bikes in China have some historical significance as being a pragmatic tool for transporting people and goods.
But will this be enough to secure the future for bicycles in China?

Stay tuned for more articles from my visit to China to discuss bikes in China as well as a profile of the fascinating Shanghai Maglev high-speed train.

Before the farmer slaughtered the rabbit, the school children were allowed to bid the creature farewell. They were standing in the school's courtyard, the rabbit pinned between their legs, and the children were in a circle around him. They should approach one-at-a-time, the farmer said, so as not to frighten the animal. "Bye bye little rabbit," the children said -- expressing gratitude that they would be able to consume it later.
The farmer from the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein had brought the gray-and-white rabbit to the school in the town of Ratekau as part of a week-long project focusing on the Stone Age, which has for years been part of the fifth-grade curriculum. Among other things, the children were to be taught that in earlier times, people couldn't just grab their food out of the freezer and throw it in the oven.
The farmer, themselves the father of a fifth-grader, had only the best intentions. Three years ago, they had carried out a similar demonstration using chickens. "Everything was done according to the slaughtering regulations," they say. And three years ago, nobody seemed to mind much.
'Killing Animals Involves Taking Responsibility'
They assumed that this time would be the same. The idea that ultimately the Education Ministry of Schleswig-Holstein might become involved never crossed their mind.
It was 10 days ago, at the very beginning of the unit, that they proposed the idea of slaughtering a rabbit to fifth-grade teachers at the school. "My point wasn't to show children death," they said. "We wanted to demonstrate the larger context: that killing animals involves taking on responsibility. Only after than can we eat the animal."
The fifth grade teachers at the school weren't sure at first how to react to the proposal. But then they took a vote: six in favor and two against. They failed, however, to inform the parents of the decision. The school's principal, Georg Krauss, says that they too are left in the dark. They say that they personally believe that animal slaughtering has no place in a school. "But the whole thing wasn't the product of sensationalism," they insist. "Children used to know that the meals on their plates had once been alive." The teachers, they say, merely wanted to raise the children's sense of value.
The farmer had three days to prepare the children for the slaughter. The process was important to them -- they studied social pedagogy and wanted to ensure that they properly contextualized what the children were about to see.
Students Launch Effort to Save Doomed Bunny
One day prior to the event, some of the fifth-graders launched an effort to save the rabbit and collected 30 signatures of classmates who were opposed to the killing. The farmer said they knew nothing about the campaign -- and the teachers ignored the petition.
"We rejected this form of protest," one of the teachers was quoted by the Lübecker Nachrichten newspaper as saying. "One can't collect signatures against a math test either."
In total, some 100 children took part in the Stone Age project -- and late last week, 50 of them voluntarily surrounded the farmer and the rabbit in the school courtyard. Before they began, the farmer told the children that what they were about to see wasn't disgusting nor was it monstrous -- and that they would agree once it was over.
Then the farmer hit the rabbit with the hammer. One child fainted, others burst into tears. Next, they slit the animal's throat with a knife, gutted the body, skinned it and hung it up to drain The next day, the rabbit was grilled in the school yard and eaten -- in Stone Age style, naturally, on a hot stone. Some mothers and fathers who had attended the feast had also tried it, the farmer recalled.
'Barbaric Events'
Shortly afterwards, outraged parents called the Lübecker Nachrichten and complained about the "barbaric events." "My son came home as pale as a ghost," one parent told the paper. "He has not slept well since then, and ate nothing for a long time." Shortly afterwards, the Schleswig-Holstein Education Ministry became involved in the case. "We consider the incident educationally problematic," ministry spokesperson Thomas Schunck said. It will be banned from happening again.
Krauss, the school principal, plans on holding "official discussions" with the relevant staff members. They will also apologize to parents for not informing them in writing beforehand. They insisted they have taken interest in the views of all parents, including those who responded positively to the lesson. "Those who have complained did not speak to me, but straight to the press," Krauss said.
The chairperson of the Parents Advisory Council for Community Schools, Stefan Hirt, said it made sense to teach children that food did not only come in frozen form. "But I find using a sledgehammer for that twisted," they said. "For 10 year olds, that is a shock that will stay with them for life. They still keep their stuffed animals in their beds."
But the farmer insisted that was nonsense. It was not the children who had the problem, but the parents. They did not want to admit, they say, that an animal must be killed to make their sausage. In any case, they say, the demonstration seems to have had the desired pedagogical effect of halting a mentality of looking away and avoiding the issue of how we actually turn animals into food. Some parents, however, disagree. "Now I have even more problems explaining to my child where meat comes from," one mother wrote to the school.
Vice President Joe Biden is having quite the week. First they used the Jewish slur "Shylock" while attempting to describe greed. Then in another speech, Biden described Asia as "The Orient."
Today at a DNC women's event (reminder, the folks over at the DNC, including Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, love using war on women rhetoric) Biden said they miss the days of bipartisanship in Washington and especially misses Republican Senator Bob Packwood.
"It was Republicans that were involved," Biden said in a speech at a DNC Women's Leadership Forum breakfast. "Guys like [former Maryland Sen.] Mac Mathias and Packwood and so many others. It wasn't Democrats alone. Republicans were the sponsors of the raises of the minimum wage. I could go on and on. I'm not joking: This is not your father's Republican Party, or your mother's Republican Party."
As a reminder, Bob Packwood was run out of the Senate for abhorrent behavior as a misogynist, serial sexual harasser/assaulter and creep.
After Republican Robert W. Packwood was narrowly reelected to the Senate by Oregon voters in 1992, The Washington Post published a lengthy front-page story outlining the senator's unwanted sexual advances as reported by 10 women, mainly former staff members and lobbyists.
The extremely detailed and convincing accounts of Packwood's gross misbehavior were appalling. Outrage toward Packwood in their home state of Oregon and across the nation grew by day. The scandal and legal entanglements surrounding it would lead the senator to tearfully end their political career in 1995.
But hey, you can't really blame Biden. Excusing sexual abuse is just a habit. After all, he's in the party that praises and glorifies Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton (who have the same records as Packwood, but because they vote the right way on abortion, were allowed by Democrats to stay in politics). At the 2012 DNC convention, Bill Clinton spoke and a seven-minute long tribute video was played in honor of Ted Kennedy's life. Naturally, they left out the chapter when Kennedy left a young woman, Mary Jo Kopechne, to die in their car.
Tourism players in Cebu and Bohol are already bracing for the impact of the declaration of martial law in Mindanao due to the ongoing gun battle between government troops and combined forces of the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups in Marawi City in Lanao del Sur.
But the blow on the tourism sector would be greater if President Duterte would extend the martial rule in the Visayas.
Placing the Visayas under martial law would be like an affirmation that terror groups had indeed reached the region, said Cenelyn Manguilimotan, past president of the Hotels, Resorts, and Restaurants Association of Cebu (HRRAC).
“I'm really praying that it (Visayas under martial law) will not happen. It will have a great impact in tourism. Declaring martial law in Visayas is like saying that the bad elements infiltrated Visayas; thus, there is a threat,” they said in a phone interview.
Manguilimotan, current general manager of the Cebu Parklane International Hotel, said HRRAC members suffered from several cancellations when at least 10 members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) attempted to set up a base in Inabanga town in Bohol on April 10.
The members of the bandit group were later killed in separate operations in the different towns in the province that lasted for over a month.
They said the businesses in the tourism sector are still trying to recover from the incident.
Just as the tourism industry in Cebu and Bohol was about to recover, the Marawi siege occurred, prompting the President to put the entire Mindanao under martial law for 60 days.
Some resorts are anticipating cancellations from guests within the week — a normal reaction when news reports about peace and order come out.
“(There is fear) that since martial law has been declared in Mindanao, some elements may also move north to escape the heat in Mindanao. With all the photos and videos posted on social media, tourist arrivals will definitely be affected,” said Be Resorts Area Marketing Communications Manager Ronalaine Fernandez-Sato.
Fernandez-Sato, who hails from Mindanao, said their whole clan is in Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur and some of their relatives are still trapped in Marawi.
“We can only do so much, but we also hear our guests out. If they don't feel comfortable coming to the Philippines, then we respect that. But instead of cancellations, we offer the alternative to rebook,” they said.
Economist and University of San Carlos professor Fernando “Perry” Fajardo said tourism players cannot anymore use the “isolated case” excuse to assure tourists that terrorist threats in the country is not serious.
Fajardo said the 2016 Davao City bombing, the ASG kidnapping attempt in Bohol, the recent explosions in Quiapo and the Marawi siege create a series of unfortunate events unfavorable to the tourism performance of the Philippines.
“Tourism will greatly be impacted downward. Watch out what's going to happen in two to three weeks as we hear of cancellations from tourists. That will affect hotel performance,” said Fajardo.
Fajardo, former assistant regional director of the National Economic Development Authority (Neda) Central Visayas, said the multiplier effect of tourism is going to affect Cebu, Bohol and tourist destinations in Mindanao such as Camiguin, Cagayan de Oro and Siargao.
“We already see it last month. What happened in Bohol affected Cebu. So what's happening in Marawi is going to affect Cebu and Bohol,” said Fajardo.
Fajardo, however, said that terrorists will not be able to penetrate Cebu or Metro Manila and will be easily neutralized just like what happened in Bohol.
“I am not worried about them coming here (Cebu). They will not survive here because they don't know this territory unlike when they are in Mindanao,” they said.
Former Department of Tourism Central Visayas (DOT-7) director Patria Aurora “Dawnie” Roa expressed their frustration in the current turn of events because of its negative impact on tourism.
“(The impact) is negative. The Japanese tourists are very sensitive. When they hear news that terrorist groups are doing something, they will immediately cancel even when the situation happens in Sulu or Basilan, which are not even destinations,” said Roa.
Roa, who spent 17 years as DOT-7 regional director and 15 years in the board of Mactan-Cebu International Airport, said situations like this will definitely discourage tourists from coming to the Philippines.
In an economic briefing on Thursday to update business leaders on investment prospects in Cebu, the discussion veered to terrorism threats and its impact to the Philippine economy when Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) president Glenn Soco asked about the country's economic health to sustain growth when faced with challenges.
Joselito Basilio, acting deputy director of economic research of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, said terrorist threats are part of the external shocks that have an impact on the growth of the economy.
Based on previous experiences with news on Brexit (Britain's exit from the European Union) and US President Trump's pronouncement of their protectionism policy, Basilio said the financial markets seemed to ride on the wave of these “noises” but things eventually settled down.
“What we hope is that this (terrorist threats) will just be temporary. We are concerned about the performance of the financial sector. Our best hope is that this noise will be short term so that this will not prolong and will not creep into the fundamental decisions of investors and businesses,” said Basilio.
Tourist destination Shangri-La's Mactan Island Resort and Spa in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, banks on the same hope as they emphasized that operations remain normal and strong security measures are in place.
“We want to assure guests and business partners that the safety and security of our guests and colleagues are our highest priority. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and maintain close contact with the local authorities,” said director of sales and marketing Myra Regner.
Fajardo said the declaration of martial law in Mindanao was “unnecessary” as it only created “negative news.”
“There is definitely a need for some form of military action in Marawi, but it was unnecessary to declare martial law,” said Fajardo.
Last week, a national leader from across the globe visited Richmond, CA to show solidarity amongst fenceline communities. Desmond D'sa, a South African native, living next to an industrial hub containing multiple petrochemical plants and two oil refineries, (one of which is the largest in the country), pointed out the vast similarities between their hometown of Durban, South Africa and the disproportionately effected fenceline community of North Richmond, CA.
At a community meeting in Richmond, hosted by International Development Exchange (IDEX), Desmond, the Director of South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA), told stories of corporate bullying, neglect and the corrupt government officials that idly stand by. These stories rang true to the residents of Richmond who have seen many of the same corporate tactics. After a toxic release in Richmond in 1991, West County Toxic Coalition wrote a letter to Chevron that included the same observation: “But when it comes to the company's damage to human beings, who are your neighbors, you have ignored your responsibilities.”
The residents of both communities are plagued by acute health problems believed to be related to the heavy industrial chemicals processed at nearby oil refineries. Asthma and cancer rates are high in both communities and the risk of accidents at the refineries is a day-to-day threat for residents. Both communities feel their health is marginalized in favor of corporate profits and that their concerns have been minimized and left to fall on deaf ears. And yet, both communities see similar solutions of real time air monitoring and emergency response plans.
Residents deserve the right to know what they are being exposed to, and real time air monitoring along the fenceline is the only way for the community to understand the level of exposure. Global Community Monitor empowers residents by training citizens to monitor their own air through the Bucket Brigade, and has worked closely with Desmond as well as other members of SDCEA. Desmond argued that collecting and distributing data regarding pollution and its health impacts were crucial in winning larger public support for environmental reforms. Industry needs to be held accountable and should be required to use their profits to clean up their mess.
These similarities do more than just make personal connections. These similarities show a troubling trend of industrial neighbors worldwide. Many industries across the globe operate with impunity and apparent disregard for their neighbors living on the fenceline. This is not an isolated problem and we cannot view it as such. In a radio interview (Desmond's portion begins around ¾ mark), Desmond stressed the need for fenceline communities, like the ones in Richmond, CA and South Durban, South Africa, to unite with other Environmental Justice groups around the world. Small groups of committed activists can alter the policies of major multinational corporations and history tells us that is usually the only way to bring about change.

Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, drew widespread criticism Sunday after they defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's press briefing on inauguration crowd sizes, saying the newly minted spokesperson had given “alternative facts” to those cited in media reports.
Chuck Todd, of NBC's “Meet the Press,” asked Conway early Sunday morning why Mr. Trump had Spicer utter a “falsehood” the first time they formally faced reporters from the White House briefing room.
“Why did they do that?” Todd questioned, referencing Spicer's incorrect assertion that the audience at Friday's inauguration was the largest to ever witness the ceremony both in person and around the globe. “It undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office on day one.”
Conway dismissed the question.
“Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck,” they replied. “You're saying it's a falsehood and they're giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that.”
“Alternative facts?” Todd shot back. “Look, alternative facts are not facts, they're falsehoods.”
The television host followed up on the continuing argument over audience turnout, which Mr. Trump also harped on Saturday while visiting CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
“What was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?” Todd pressed.
Conway quipped: “Your job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president. That's not your job.”
The senior Trump defended Spicer further against Todd: “Chuck, I mean, if we're going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think that we're going to have to rethink our relationship here,” they said. “I want to give a great open relationship with our press.”
Following the interview, social media exploded with a new trending topic: “#AlternativeFacts.”
Twitter users criticized Conway's television appearance by coming up with their own “alternative facts.”
As a member of the @backstreetboys, I had a love child with @BettyMWhite. #AlternativeFacts — Lance Bass (@LanceBass) January 22, 2017
Even a member of Congress got in on the social media action:
BREAKING NEWS: @seanspicer at #WhiteHouse says Warriors beat Cavs in championship game last year. Period. #alternativefacts — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) January 22, 2017
And the Merriam-Webster dictionary company seemed to play on the trend Sunday, tweeting out its definition of the word “fact.”
📈A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality. https://t.co/gCKRZZm23c — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 22, 2017
Spicer themselves has previously promised not to tell falsehoods to the White House press corps as an administration official.
During an appearance at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics earlier this month, Spicer told David Axelrod: “I don't think any communicator worth their salt to go out and tell a lie...To go out and tell a lie is something that's not acceptable.”
“I may tell a reporter I can't comment on something… I'm not able to discuss it. But I've never lied,” Spicer said. “I would argue that anybody who's an aspiring communicator adhere to that. If you lose the respect and trust of the press corps, you've got nothing.”
According to Donald Trump's election rhetoric, Mexico was exporting criminals and rapists. Now the president-elect is calling for a border tax on exports of Mexican-made General Motors vehicles.
In Trump's view, the southern neighbour represents a threat, whether it's from teeming migrants crossing the border to compete for U.S. jobs or low-paid workers attracting factory jobs to Mexico.
That's not what the experts say, especially for Canada.
There is growing evidence that Mexico and Canada are ideal trade partners and that Canadian business will benefit by opening doors, not building walls.
Trump tweeted their call for a "big border tax" on GM's Mexican-built vehicles yesterday morning.
General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! —@realDonaldTrump
GM was quick to respond, insisting that most of its cars sold in the U.S. were made there.
Ford, meanwhile, announced it was cancelling a $1.6-billion Mexican auto plant while expanding operations in Michigan to build electrics and hybrids.
Trade opportunity
With such a reaction, it might be tempting to suggest that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau follow suit and demand cars sold in Canada be made in Canada.
But in the case of Mexico, there's a better way.
Although the U.S. with its right-to-work legislation could try to compete with Mexico for low-wage jobs, that would be much more difficult for Canada.
Demonstrators from the countryside march down Mexico City's main boulevard past the sparkling stock exchange buildings, showing two sides of a country in transition. (Don Pittis/CBC) And despite the stereotypical view of many Canadians, Mexico is much more than a low-wage economy.
Handicraft markets on beach vacations may perpetuate a cartoon image of the country, but a visit to Mexico's vibrant and sparkling capital city, undergoing a long-term building boom, offers a very different view.
A new report by the Conference Board of Canada commissioned by HSBC makes the case that Mexico and Canada may be ideal trade and investment partners.
The report sees clear signs that Mexico is on the verge of an economic transition that will only benefit Canadian companies that get involved.
Despite Trump's claims, the number of Mexicans running from poverty to the United States has dwindled. While Spanish speakers continue to cross Mexico to enter the United States from other Latin American countries, an increasing number of Mexicans are finding good work at home.
Mexico gains as U.S. trade partner
In December, news that Mexico had displaced Canada as America's second biggest trading partner got lots of attention in Mexico.
But the reason U.S. companies want to locate there is that the country has become a global manufacturing hub, having free trade deals with more countries than anywhere else.
The median age of Mexicans is 28, compared with 42 in Canada, but the population explosion has ended. A declining Mexican birthrate and increasing job prospects are leading to what the Boston Consulting Group describes as an imminent "demographic dividend."
"Essentially, Mexico could benefit from a similar economic boom to what Canada and the U.S. experienced in the 1970s, when the wave of baby boomers entered the workforce," says the Conference Board report. "As a result, millions of Mexican households will be joining the middle class in coming years which is likely to fuel robust growth in consumer spending."
Mexico is far less vulnerable to external shocks than it was during previous economic predicaments such as the Tequila Crisis in the mid-1990s.
According to a recent report from the rich countries' think-tank, the OECD, the largest part of Mexican growth is being created at home as ordinary people strive to obtain goods and services Canadians have grown to expect.
The Golden Angel of Independence is a proud national symbol in Mexico City. (Don Pittis/CBC) "Domestic demand remains the main driver of economic activity, supported by recent structural reforms that have cut prices to consumers, notably on electricity and telecoms services," says the OECD November economic forecast for the country.
As Robert Gordon noted in their recent book, The Rise and Fall of American Growth, the one-time adoption of modern technology can create a dramatic economic transition.
Already Canadian companies have begun to offer their experience, notably Scotiabank, with more than 800 bank branches, in a country expected by the International Monetary Fund to outgrow the U.S. and Canada.
But as Mexicans explore middle-class advantages from pets to consumer goods and a wide variety of international foods, there are plenty more opportunities for Canadian companies, says the Conference Board report.
No country's future is perfectly secure. Inequality, corruption and organized crime make people feel unsafe and are bad for legal businesses.
There are signs of a backlash in the coming elections, as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as Amlo for their initials) takes a page out of Trump's book and runs for president as a populist outsider, promising to stamp out corruption and "Mafia power" and bring real change to the country.
It seems inevitable that change is coming to Mexico, and Canada has much to offer, from education and technology to services and social strategies to specialized manufactured goods and high-quality foods.
Trump's attacks on Mexico have damaged the country's pride, and the president-elect is so disliked that their image was used as a pinata during holiday festivities. Canadian business can win respect, and perhaps opportunity, simply by presenting a friendly and understanding face.

With many years of rowing training and competition under my belt, I never foresaw maintaining one's physique as a challenge. Rather, it was just a part of my lifestyle, and I took great pride in my athleticism.
After more than a year on the road, though, an old training partner saw my photos and remarked that I'd acquired the “traveler's body.” To my distaste, they were right. In a double whammy, I'd both lost my strength and gained body fat.
The pace of this degradation had caught me by surprise, but it shouldn't have. When traveling and socializing in hostels, one can easily lose track of the days of the week — and every day seems fitting for a celebration. Along with less-than-ideal food, inclinations towards liquor, and irregular sleep, one's gym and workout routines are broken. Further, air travel exposes individuals to heightened risks of infection, radiation, and altitude stress.
I'm willing to bet that frequent air travel and a long-term nomadic lifestyle have a detrimental impact on an individual's lifespan.
One can, of course, overcome and avoid the asupervisorstioned challenges. Given my pursuit of job prospects and travel adventures in new places, that's precisely what I've had to do. Gradually, I've acquired new habits that have helped, and I'd like to share my strategy with Stateless Man readers.
Most importantly, I've made running my long-term sport or recreational activity, and I've participated in a variety of marathons and shorter races to motivate my training. You might love rollerblading, swimming, aerobics, or whatever — and by all means, do them when you can — but only running offers near universal travel convenience. In my own case, I had little choice but to sell my precious rowing machine (pictured), since you can't exactly travel with that on your shoulder.
Not only can you run almost anywhere, it helps you get to know a city. That's why one of the first things I do when I arrive in a new place is to lace up my running shoes and explore. Further, given so many running meetups, it is a fast way to network with healthy, disciplined locals. (I won't forget my old friends with the Varsity Sports Running and Social Club, New Orleans, and the Halifax Running Club, Nova Scotia, in particular.)
As a primer, I recommend The Essential Runner, my own first book on the topic. Although published in 1994, it remains informative and useful because of its many inspirational stories and guidance for easing beginners into the sport.
In terms of equipment, you need little. There may be increasingly expensive and clunky running shoes on the market, but my own experience is that they tend to be a waste of money. The claim that sophisticated shoes reduce injury is becoming more doubtful, and that's one reason for the Vibram Fivefingers craze. These affordable rubber slippers seek to enable rather than work against one's natural running movements.
I still have a penchant for Asics , a high-end brand. However, for the past ten or so years I've forgone their expensive models for racing flats and basic trainers , and I've never had any serious injuries.
A watch with GPS capacity is handy, since it will give you distance and record your workouts — including when you do not have a phone or internet connection to work with. These are improving in quality all the time, and Timex appears to offer the best value. My own choice is in the image, but a newer model is available, and you can get it with or without a heart rate function.
Additionally, I get plenty of use out of my SPI running belt (pictured). This is big enough to store your cell phone, keys, bank card, and perhaps a map of the area. It's also more secure and inconspicuous than just carrying items in your hands.
Beyond running, I look for a local park with a chin-up bar. This is more common than you might realize — almost every city seems to have one, from Tres Cruces overlooking Cali, Colombia, to right here in Pompano Beach, Florida — and I then incorporate that stop into my running loops.
In addition to just stretching, these public workout areas facilitate my three favorite body-weight exercises: prone (overhand) chin-ups, one-legged (pistol) squats, and raised press-ups (“push-ups” in U.S. vernacular) — all pictured below. Each one focuses on a different part of your body — back, legs, and chest — and my preference is to do each once per week. Normally, I'll do five sets, alongside a run, with the number of reps determined by the particular exercise. For sophisticated, periodized training plans which require a gym, see The New Power Program by Michael Colgan.
If you have any additional ideas for working out on the road, don't hesitate to leave them in the comments. In future, I'll also work on a post regarding the nutrition side of the equation. If you'd like to be updated, please do not hesitate to subscribe to my weekly e-newsletter or like my Facebook page.
We took these photos at a nearby park in Pompano Beach, Florida.
1. Prone chin-ups. These have been a favorite ever since my father built a chin-up bar for me at our farm in New Zealand. We then replicated it at my flat in Cambridge, and an old friend and I sought to get to 1,000 chin-ups in one day. I only got to 500, but the next day my arms were so fatigued I could not pick up the phone.
These days I have a belt to add weight for greater resistance, but that is not so practical for traveling.
2. One-legged squats. While I love conventional squats at the gym, one-legged squats are an excellent substitute. They offer a high degree of resistance, similar to chin-ups, so you can get a fast workout. They also recruit stabilizers and build coordination.
If you find them difficult to begin with, as everyone seems to, start by squatting down to a bench, rather than going all the way down. You can also do them while resting your arm on a ledge or bar. At some point, you may wish to add weight in your hands — water bottles, for example — but body-weight alone is usually sufficient.
3. Raised press-ups. Everyone knows press-ups, but alone they offer less resistance than the other exercises presented here. That's why I recommend raising your legs on a bench and lowering your chin all the way to the ground. There is an array of more advanced versions you can also consider.
Great stuff. The list gives me a key way to think about the relative valuations of these pitchers. I moved ERod + Belt to get Salazar last week (still convincing myself I came out on top despite their most recent poor performance). A few quick questions:
1) What are your realistic expectations from Price when they come back? I drafted them way too high and am I clinging on to some hope that he's a beast upon return.
2) What are some good buy-low pitching targets for this week? I've got solid infielders who consistently sit on my bench and want to try and package them with a high sell on Gio before they start to shit the bed (as a Nats fan I'm confident that they will). I was thinking Tanaka or Quintana.
3) I've got pretty solid pitching (Darvish / DeGrom / Stras / Salazar / Pomeranz / Gonzalez / Berrios, Price/Hernandez on DL), and was considering selling high on DeGrom or Stras while they're still healthy. Do you think this would be a solid move given my pitching depth?
Thanks!
The most recent downgrade by the Fitch rating agency that leaves Russia just one step away from ‘junk' status won't have a dramatic impact on the economy, Russian economists have told RT.
“A Fitch downgrade will have a limited effect on the Russian economy, as the situation is already tense,”Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Financial Group told RT by phone. They also said that Russia has limited access to international finance after the US and the EU imposed sanctions on the country's financial sector.
Aleksandr Prosviryakov, treasury and commodities consultant at PwC Russia, also says the worst happened back in spring 2014 when the West imposed sanctions.
“Russia is already trading at yield levels above Lebanon, which is rated at six notches below at B-. Most international institutional investors started to sell their holdings of Russian assets in March 2014 after the first sanctions were announced,” they said.
Tikhomirov says the most important thing is that Russia remains at investment grade. However, they warn of more risks to the Russian rating, saying the country's economy is poised to slow down in 2015, as both investment and consumer demand will shrink.
“There's 40-50 percent likelihood that Russia will be downgraded to ‘junk' status. If it happens the Russian market will start falling sharply and the pressure on the ruble will increase,” Tikhomirov added.
They said the Fitch assessment just put it in line with S&P which downgraded Russia in December. Then S&P revised Russia's rating to BBB-, saying there is a 50 percent possibility it'll drop Russia to junk level in mid-January 2015.
Prosviryakov was more optimistic, saying no further downgrades will reflect the real situation in Russia's economy, as the current figures evidently indicate better performance.
“It is obvious that a country with US$400 billion of reserves and a public debt of 12 percent of GDP cannot be considered as ‘junk'. The ratings do not reflect the reality anymore,” they said, adding that Russia received an investment grade rating in 2004 when it had $80 billion of reserves and the oil price was around $35.
“It is also interesting to note that last week the Chinese agency Dagong maintained Russia's rating at A, which is one notch above USA's A- rating,” Prosviryakov said.
Given that Russia does not issue foreign debt any more, the possible rating downgrade will not have a material effect on the economy, they said.
However, talking about the Russian economic outlook in 2015, Prosviryakov said the economy this year is set to have negative growth dynamics.
Nevertheless, they said a turnaround is possible if there is a sharp rebound in oil prices in the second half of the year, as the steepness of the decline also depends on the prices of Russia's main export products, which are linked to the oil price.
On Saturday international ratings agency Fitch downgraded Russia's credit rating by one notch from BBB to BBB- with a negative outlook, leaving the country a peg above the non-investment rating known as ‘junk' status.
The rating agency explained that Russia's economic profile was becoming increasingly fragile amid sanctions, slumping oil, the currency crisis, and capital outflow.

Oil prices edged up in Asia after steep falls
News Hour:
Oil prices edged up on Friday on bargain-buying and a weaker dollar after another slump fuelled by a surge in US stockpiles and worries about an upcoming meeting to tackle a global supply glut, reports BSS.
Both main contracts slumped more than three percent on Thursday after Russia suggested it may not be necessary to limit production, denting hopes for its gathering with OPEC in Algeria this month.
The losses meant crude had lost a tenth of its value from its August highs, making it ripe for traders looking for bargains.
At about 0330 GMT the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in October was up 27 cents, or 0.63 percent, at $43.43 and Brent crude for November climbed 32 cents, or 0.70 percent, to $45.77.
Traders now have their eyes on the release later Friday of US jobs figures, which will be pored over for an idea of what the Federal Reserve plans to do with interest rates.
Expectations for a hike in borrowing costs have swirled since last Friday when Fed boss Janet Yellen indicated the economy was strong enough for a hike.
That, in turn, fuelled a rally in the dollar, which has dented oil prices as it makes the commodity more expensive to anyone holding other currencies.
However, the greenback retreated on Thursday after a surprise plunge in a gauge of US factory activity raised questions about the economy.
“Some rebound is expected after the sharp falls as investors adjust positions ahead of the US non-farm payrolls release and the weekend,” said IG Markets Singapore analyst Bernard Aw.
They added: “The medium-term outlook remains dim for crude oil.”
Oil entered a bull market last month — a 20 percent rise from recent loss — on hopes that Russia and OPEC would be able to reach a deal after agreeing to the Algiers meeting.
But doubts have crept in this week after OPEC members Iran and Iraq said they wanted to increase output, followed by Moscow's comments on Thursday.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was quoted as saying talks on a production freeze would not be needed if prices stood around $50 per barrel.
On Wednesday, the US Energy Department released data showing commercial crude inventories in the world's top oil consumer edged up last week and were now 16 percent higher than the same period last year.

Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday LAKings.com will count down the Top 15 moments from the LA Kings improbable run to their 2nd Stanley Cup Championship.
May 3 presented a historic night as Southern California's two NHL clubs met for the first time ever in postseason play.
Marian Gaborik made it memorable.
In Game 1 of the Kings' Western Conference Semifinal series against the Anaheim Ducks at Honda Center, the final seconds proved to be crucial as the Kings scrapped desperately to overcome a late one-goal deficit.
Down 2-1 with seconds remaining in regulation, Jonathan Quick was pulled for an extra attacker.
Mike Richards, who was aware of the waning time, feverishly worked to maintain control of the puck, and in one swift motion, fed a Hail-Mary type pass toward the front of Anaheim's net in hopes of a tip, deflection, or rebound.
Gaborik was there to capitalize, knotting the score 2-2 with :07.0 seconds remaining.
MARIAN'S ON THE CLOCK
Then, just over 12 minutes into overtime, Anze Kopitar found Gaborik streaking to Anaheim's net undetected. Kopitar fed a shot/pass that Gaborik tipped off the left post, off of Jonas Hiller's back, and into the net to give the Kings a 3-2 victory, and a 1-0 series lead.
Money.
THE BANK'S OPEN
007 strikes again for the Kings. pic.twitter.com/sImbVxOrru — Brian McCarthy (@brianmccarthy1) May 4, 2014
The newly acquired forward was snagged from the Columbus Blue Jackets on March 5 by Dean Lombardi just moments prior to the NHL's trade-deadline. It was an outstanding acquisition for Lombardi and the Kings, who only had to surrender Matt Frattin and a pair of draft picks in the trade.
Gaborik led all NHL players with 14 postseason goals, and was rewarded with a new seven-year, $34.13 million contract with the Kings on June 25.
So, the Gaborik trade has worked out so far. — Flubber McGee (@FlubberMcGee) May 4, 2014
And Dean Lombardi should probably send a fruit basket or something to Columbus. #LAKings — Jim Alexander (@Jim_Alexander) May 4, 2014

Every time you go shopping, you share intimate details about your consumption patterns with retailers. And many of those retailers are studying those details to figure out what you like, what you need, and which coupons are most likely to make you happy. Target , for example, has figured out how to data-mine its way into your womb, to figure out whether you have a baby on the way long before you need to start buying diapers.
Charles Duhigg outlines in the New York Times how Target tries to hook parents-to-be at that crucial moment before they turn into rampant -- and loyal -- buyers of all things pastel, plastic, and miniature. They talked to Target statistician Andrew Pole -- before Target freaked out and cut off all communications -- about the clues to a customer's impending bundle of joy. Target assigns every customer a Guest ID number, tied to their credit card, name, or email address that becomes a bucket that stores a history of everything they've bought and any demographic information Target has collected from them or bought from other sources. Using that, Pole looked at historical buying data for all the ladies who had signed up for Target baby registries in the past. From the NYT:
[Pole] ran test after test, analyzing the data, and before long some useful patterns emerged. Lotions, for example. Lots of people buy lotion, but one of Pole's colleagues noticed that women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks, pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium, magnesium and zinc. Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date.
Or have a rather nasty infection...
As Pole's computers crawled through the data, they were able to identify about 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed them to assign each shopper a “pregnancy prediction” score. More important, they could also estimate their due date to within a small window, so Target could send coupons timed to very specific stages of their pregnancy. One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical example. Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward, who is 23, lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion, a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc and magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug. There's, say, an 87 percent chance that she's pregnant and that their delivery date is sometime in late August. via How Companies Learn Your Secrets - NYTimes.com.
And perhaps that it's a boy based on the color of that rug?
So Target started sending coupons for baby items to customers according to their pregnancy scores. Duhigg shares an anecdote -- so good that it sounds made up -- that conveys how eerily accurate the targeting is. An angry man went into a Target outside of Minneapolis, demanding to talk to a manager:
Target knows before it shows. “My daughter got this in the mail!” they said. “She's still in high school, and you're sending their coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage them to get pregnant?” The manager didn't have any idea what the man was talking about. They looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man's daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.
(Nice customer service, Target.)
On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” they said. “It turns out there's been some activities in my house I haven't been completely aware of. She's due in August. I owe you an apology.”
What Target discovered fairly quickly is that it creeped people out that the company knew about their pregnancies in advance.
“If we send someone a catalog and say, ‘Congratulations on your first child!' and they've never told us they're pregnant, that's going to make some people uncomfortable,” Pole told me. “We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. But even if you're following the law, you can do things where people get queasy.”
Bold is mine. That's a quote for our times.

So Target got sneakier about sending the coupons. The company can create personalized booklets; instead of sending people with high pregnancy scores books o' coupons solely for diapers, rattles, strollers, and the "Go the F*** to Sleep" book, they more subtly spread them about:
“Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We'd put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We'd put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it looked like all the products were chosen by chance. “And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks they haven't been spied on, she'll use the coupons. They just assumes that everyone else on their block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. As long as we don't spook her, it works.” via How Companies Learn Your Secrets - NYTimes.com.
So the Target philosophy towards expecting parents is similar to the first date philosophy? Even if you've fully stalked the person on Facebook and Google beforehand, pretend like you know less than you do so as not to creep the person out.
Duhigg suggests that Target's gangbusters revenue growth -- $44 billion in 2002, when Pole was hired, to $67 billion in 2010 -- is attributable to Pole's helping the retail giant corner the baby-on-board market, citing company president Gregg Steinhafel boasting to investors about the company's “heightened focus on items and categories that appeal to specific guest segments such as mom and baby.”
Target was none too happy about Duhigg's plans to write this story. They refused to let them go to Target headquarters. When they flew out anyway, they discovered they were on a list of prohibited visitors.
I think most readers of the excellent piece will find it both unsettling and unsurprising. With all the talk these days about the data grab most companies are engaged in, Target's collection and analysis seem as expected as its customers' babies. But with their analysis moving into areas as sensitive as pregnancy, and so accurately, who knows how else they might start profiling Target shoppers? The store's bulls-eye logo may now send a little shiver of fear down the closely-watched spines of some, though I can promise you that Target is not the only store doing this. Those people chilled by stores' tracking and profiling them may want to consider going the way of the common criminal -- and paying for far more of their purchases in cash.

#887: “Naming myself.”
Hi Captain,
(Pronouns, Her,She)
I changed my name two years ago. I changed both my first name and last name and removed my middle name. My previous name was fairly innocuous although it more obviously denoted my heritage (Irish). My current name is also fairly innocuous and my first name is also quite similar in many ways to my old first name.
Most of the people in my life have adapted very easily and respectfully to calling me by my new name.
My mom struggled but they mostly try and sometimes does a mashup of my old and new names. I just remind them of my new name and they take the reminder well.
I have a problem with my aunt though. They believe that I need to give them a good enough reason for why I changed my name before they will call me by my new name. My reasons are entirely for spiritual growth/soul thrill but most people are going to be weirded out by that so I just say because I feel the name suits me better as a person (which is also true).
She's not someone who would be respectful of my spiritual beliefs anyway.
I just don't know how to approach this claim that they need to validate my reason of my name change! My reply at the time was a swift F you and EXIT SCENE LEFT THROUGH DOOR THAT DID NOT SLAM PROPERLY… but I would really like to wrap my head around it and be able to stand up for myself more calmly.
Thank you so much for your time whether you post or not!
Best,
Someone who loves my new name!
Dear New Name,
I don't know how much you hang out with this aunt after the Day of The Unsuccessful Door Slam, but when you cross paths again, if your name becomes an issue again, try this:
“I don't know that there is a reason that will satisfy you. It was important to me to do it and it makes me happy to have done it. I don't want to fight with you or keep having to justify a decision that's mine to make. Do you want to have a relationship with me, New Name, or not?”
If Aunt still refuses to call you by your name, then you know she's chosen “or not.” It's your human right to name yourself, and it's a really hostile & rude thing to purposely and continually call someone by the wrong name.
I hope the next time you see them it all goes better.
Officials Worry About Some Latino Converts To Islam
toggle caption Steve Ruark/AP
The FBI arrested Antonio Martinez, a 21-year-old Muslim convert, Wednesday and charged them with plotting to blow up a military recruitment center. There are two things about this case that make it particularly interesting to counterterrorism officials. The first is that Martinez appears to have been radicalized in the U.S. The second is that they are Latino. Latino converts to radical Islam have been connected to terrorism cases in this country with increasing frequency -- and officials are trying to understand why.
The FBI began tracking Martinez, who also went by the name Muhammad Hussain, in October. That's when, according to the criminal complaint against him, Martinez allegedly struck up a conversation with an FBI source and told them that they wanted to attack U.S. military personnel.
Martinez allegedly believed that the U.S. had long been at war with Muslims, and they said that Muslim brothers needed to strike back. After taping hours of Martinez's conversations, the FBI ended up providing them with what they thought was a car bomb. They allegedly parked it outside an armed forces recruiting station in Catonsville, Md., on Wednesday and was arrested after they allegedly tried to detonate it.
The explosives were inert and no one, Justice Department officials said, was ever in any danger. While there is already some discussion about Martinez having been entrapped by a terrorism sting operation launched by the FBI, officials say to concentrate on that misses another wrinkle in the case: Why do a small number of Latinos in this country seem to convert not just to Islam but to a radical form of it?
"In some ways, it is not the volume [of conversion] necessarily. It is not like folks are worried about vast communities or subcommunities of Latinos joining al-Qaida," said Juan Zarate, a former deputy national security adviser in the Bush administration who is now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "What has got people's attention is the nature of individuals who have been caught in this web."
In some ways, it is not the volume [of conversion] necessarily. It is not like folks are worried about vast communities or subcommunities of Latinos joining al-Qaida. What has got people's attention is the nature of individuals who have been caught in this web.
The individuals involved have been at the center of what terrorism officials consider important cases. There is Jose Padilla, the former Chicago native who pleaded guilty to training with al-Qaida; or Daniel Maldonado, a Latino-American who was one of the first U.S. citizens to join an al-Qaida affiliate group in Somalia. Officials also point to Bryant Neal Vinas, a Latino from Long Island who found themselves in al-Qaida's inner circle a couple of years ago. They talked to the group's leadership about how to attack the Long Island Rail Road and, according to officials close to the case, "has been a gold mine of information about al-Qaida ever since."
"It's both the nature of these individuals but also their case studies, the substantive dimensions of their work, and who they are in contact with, and what they represent that I think is why Latino converts have garnered some attention from counterterrorism analysts and the community," Zarate said. "These are cases people are still following. They are still instructive."
One of the reasons these officials are interested in Latino converts is that al-Qaida appears to be. The terrorist group has specifically recruited Latinos under the assumption that they could move in and around the United States without arousing suspicion.
Before Wednesday's arrest, the most recent terrorism case involving a Latino happened over the summer. That's when two New Jersey men, Mohammed Alessa and Carlos Almonte, were arrested as they boarded a plane for Somalia. They allegedly planned to join the ranks of a terrorist group there called al-Shabab. The New York Police Department, the FBI and New Jersey law enforcement had had the two men under surveillance for years; Almonte, in particular, became of interest because they were Latino and allegedly so firmly embraced radical Islam.
"Carlos Almonte was of Dominican heritage, a naturalized U.S. citizen, from a middle-class family; their father was a school bus driver; and they grew up in a Catholic family," said Mitch Silber, the head of the New York Police Department's intelligence unit. "And as Almonte started to change, they dropped their non-Muslim friends and their change was visible to others."
Almonte allegedly started hanging out with members of Revolution Muslim, an Islamist group in New York, and joined their online chats. They began talking about what they saw as America's war on Islam. Those are two things that they apparently had in common with the suspect in this latest case, Martinez.
Officials say the Internet isn't the only place radicalizing these Latino converts. Authorities have been tracking an increasing number of Latino converts who embrace radical Islam in prison. The concern, Zarate says, is that prison recruits will redirect their criminal energies and engage in terrorism.
"I think that it is in that intersection with prison radicalization, gang culture, religious zealotry that you have a potential problem," Zarate said. "I wouldn't say it is a wave, but it is a potential problem authorities watch for."
"We spend more on health care than any other country, but we're ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality."
It is a common refrain among politicians lamenting the state of America's health care system: spending more on health care doesn't necessarily make the United States a healthier country.
That's a theme repeated in the report accompanying the Democratic Party's convention platform. It claims, "We spend more on health care than any other country, but we're ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality."
The first part of the statement is certainly true. The United States has spent more per capita on health care than any other country for decades, and its spending has grown faster, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
A recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis shows that in the most recent figures available, U.S. spending on health care per capita was $5,711 in 2003. The second-place finisher, Luxembourg, spends $4,611.
As for life expectancy and child mortality, the Democratic National Committee couldn't provide the source for the platform committee's statistics. But the numbers do match Census Bureau statistics that are used in the CIA's 2008 World Factbook, which shows the United States ranks 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality.
You might see different rankings depending on where you look. The United States scores better in lists compiled by the World Health Organization or the United Nations.
That's because each of these organizations ranks countries differently. The U.S. Census Bureau includes many more places in its rankings, such as tiny territories and small chunks of countries, as the Wall Street Journal's "The Numbers Guy" blog has pointed out.
Still, no matter whose list you check, there's no denying that the United States' infant mortality rate is higher than other large industrialized countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and Japan. And this is true despite the United States being the world leader in spending. We give the Democratic platform committee a True.
Thecamoebians are among the 30-45 lineages of amoebae known to exist worldwide. During their evolution, they have developed the ability to produce a varyingly shaped outer carapace or shell in which to protect themselves.
A group of researchers at the University of São Paulo's Bioscience Institute (IB-USP) in Brazil, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Maringá (UEM) in Paraná State, as well as a firm of environmental consultants based in Vila Velha, Espírito Santo State, and a researcher from Minas Gerais, have identified a species of thecamoeba with a carapace that resembles the wizard's hat worn by Gandalf, one of the most important characters in The Lord of the Rings, a series of novels by J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973).
Named Arcella gandalfi as a tribute to Tolkien's wizard, the new species of amoeba is described in an article published by the journal Acta Protozoologica.
"New amoeba species are very rarely discovered because they're so tiny and not widely studied. In addition, there are very few taxonomists who specialize in this group in Brazil," said Daniel J. G. Lahr, a professor in IB-USP's Zoology Department and the principal investigator for the project.
In recent years, Lahr began receiving reports of the existence of this species of freshwater microorganism from various parts of Brazil, such as Minas Gerais, Tocantins, Paraná, Amapá and Rio de Janeiro.
The number of specimens collected in these regions was so small, however, that it was impossible to perform a laboratory analysis to make sure that they genuinely represented a new species.
Last year, Lahr was contacted by Jordana de Carvalho e Féres, a biologist who works for a firm of environmental consultants in Espírito Santo. They specialize in taxonomic identification and population analysis of zooplankton, tiny invertebrates that float freely throughout the seas and other bodies of water. They had found the testate (shelled) amoeba in two samples collected from Amapá and Rio de Janeiro, they told him. The sample from Rio de Janeiro contained 180 specimens.
They agreed that they would go to Lahr's lab in São Paulo to train in microscopy techniques and partner with the group of researchers at IB-USP on a description of the new species.
"We succeeded in isolating the organism from the samples, performed all the necessary measurements and produced images to make sure it really was a new species," Lahr said.
Their analysis was based on biometric and morphological characterization. They concluded that the characteristic funnel shape of A. gandalfi was unique among species belonging to the genus Arcella, one of the largest genera of testate amoebae.
The color of A. gandalfi ranges from light yellow to brown, and the diameter and height of its conical shell average 81 and 71 micrometers, respectively. A micrometer is one-tenth of a millimeter.
Although A. gandalfi is microscopic, it is considered large for a single-celled organism. "It's just one cell, and yet it's capable of building this funnel-shaped carapace," Lahr said.
Because it is easily identified based on its morphological features and because its geographic distribution appears to be confined to South America, the researchers suggest its use as a new flagship species.
A flagship species is a key species for a specific ecosystem or habitat, and it can serve as an icon or emblem of an environmental cause.
According to Lahr, there are no records of any species resembling A. gandalfi from any other part of the world. "The identification of a new species of microorganism in the Southern Hemisphere, as in the case of this amoeba, is very strong evidence that its geographic distribution is restricted to the region because Northern Hemisphere environments have been studied in far more depth," they said. "This is especially so for such a conspicuous species with a shape unlike any other."
Most amoebae in the genus Arcella are less than half the size of A. gandalfi and vary considerably in morphology, typically being hemispherical or disk-shaped.
Some resemble an Asian rice hat, while others are crown-like with denticulations -- small ridges resembling bristles or spines around the edges.
The genus Arcella comprises some 200 species and is one of the most diverse genera among thecamoebians.
Why the carapace?
The researchers do not yet know the exact purpose of the amoeba's carapace.
The classic idea is that the shell-like structure, made of silicon or organic matter secreted by the cell, serves as some form of protection against predators.
Lahr does not find this idea very plausible. "Thecamoebians are strongly predated, and we often find their carapaces ingested by a class of protozoans called ciliates, for example," they said. "For these microorganisms, the shell is not protective like armor plating, as it is in the case of arthropods, which are preyed on by animals of the same size."
One of the researchers' hypotheses is that the carapace may protect the amoebae not against predators but against dryness: abundant among plankton inhabiting shallow lakes and ponds, streams and reservoirs, as well as among aquatic plants, these amoebae are frequently left high and dry as water levels fluctuate.
"We think they're able to maintain a humid microenvironment inside the shell when it's dry outside, by storing even a tiny amount of water," Lahr said.
Another hypothesis is that the carapace affords protection against ultraviolet radiation. "Their habitats are aquatic, and they're often exposed to sunlight, so protection against UV rays must be a very important factor," they said.
"A multicellular organism has a number of protective barriers against UV radiation, including a layer of keratin, as well as skin pigments. In the case of single-cell organisms like amoebae, their DNA is basically exposed."
It's not over yet! More Episode Finale Art!!!Was kinda wondering what I'd be making, some that I had in high regard were this, a piece with Discord and Tirek or Golden Oak Library.Became the song related one! Oh my, the princesses singing, all of them.When we first heard Celestia singing in S3 I was already like "Let us hear the other princesses!!!". They sure delivered lol, not just with 1 but with all of them.When this started I still was worried about the perspective, but I think that turned out alright. In the end tried not to care too much about the sky's curve and horizon, focusing on the character positions.So much that can still be made with just the finale. I'm planning on another Finale piece next Saturday. Hopefully I'll be able to keep up at least a decent quality hehe.They'll play their part.Edit: Felt like Luna's mane was too far off from the show's style (too puffy and large at top) so I couldn't resist adjusting it.

If you have even a cursory interest in hip-hop, rhythm and blues, and/or hi-top fades, chances are you've heard about Canadian dark R&B mega-sensation the Weeknd. You are also probably aware that the main man behind the project is a 22-year-old ex-American Apparel employee named Abel Tesfaye. He's done very well for themselves in a very short period of time—becoming BFFs with Drake, securing an upcoming 2012 Coachella performance, and remixing a Lady Gaga song within a year of their free mixtape debut House of Balloons.
The tidal wave of hype that has been building over the last 12 months began with the release of three songs: "What You Need," "Loft Music" and “The Morning (Original Version).” Discerning listeners might remember that the production of these standout tracks was originally credited to a guy named Jeremy Rose, who has since parted ways with Abel. Yet, until now, no one knew the full story of why and how the split happened.
The handful of Weeknd fans and music journalists who have followed the story have only been able to discern that “creative differences” were to blame, Jeremy is now producing under the moniker Zodiac, and that all mentions of their name had been scrubbed from the final version of House of Balloons. Recently, Jeremy decided to set the record straight, and the facts ain't pretty. After our interview, I attempted to reach out to Abel to see if they had anything to add to the discourse. A member of their crew who goes by the name “XO” got back to me via Facebook, claiming that Abel had “no comment.”
VICE: What's your backstory? When did you start making music?
Jeremy Rose: I was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and lived around Nova Scotia, mostly Dartmouth, until I was ten. It's kind of a shitty town, so my parents, my brother, and me moved to Chatham, Ontario. I lived there until I was about 21. Chatham is a small town surrounded by cornfields. Nothing to do. Lots of drug use. Teen moms. Stuff like that. The music scene there were just kids playing screamo shit. I didn't really fit in, so that's why I got out. Then I moved to Toronto. I had some intentions of doing music out here, but I've always been a slow worker. I really take my time with it.
How did you first meet Abel?
My girlfriend was working at Poutini's [a poutine spot in Toronto, obviously] and I used to hang out with a couple of these Australian guys that worked there. That's where I met Abel, they were hanging out at their house. I was showing them some things in Ableton, because they were interested in that stuff and I was playing the beat for “What You Need.” I had that thing for a couple years and I didn't know what to do with it. Anyway, Abel was there and they started free-styling on top of it.
So that was the impetus of the Weeknd?
Yeah, that's when I asked them if they wanted to work on something—I had this idea for a dark R&B project. I think I talked to Curtis Santiago [aka Talwst, local Toronto R&B dude] about it, but they aren't really what I was looking for because they were on some other thing. Abel seemed to suit the project.
And would it be fair to say that you basically conceptualized the Weeknd's sound? Because the first three songs that leaked were “What You Need,” “Loft Music,” and “The Morning”—the original version that didn't make it onto House of Balloons, which is much slower than the version that wound up on the mixtape.
Yeah, it's slowed down and has a layered backwards beat on top of a forward beat, so it's funky that way. The version that you get on House of Balloons wasn't me. It was whoever, Doc or Illangelo [the officially credited and highly publicized producers of House of Balloons].
Just so we're crystal clear: The first three songs released by the Weeknd, which Drake posted to their blog, all feature your production.
Yeah.
And those are the first three tracks that initially got the Weeknd recognized by outlets like the New York Times and Pitchfork.
Yeah.
You also produced “The Party & The After Party,” correct?
Yeah, but originally it was just “The Party,” which is the first half of the song. The second half of the song is where it gets all..
Dark and weird.
Yeah, and slows down and everything? That wasn't made by me. That was tacked on afterward by somebody else, which I was kind of pissed off about, because, that's not very cool. But whatever, that's that.
Right. When you two first met, was Abel's creative direction heading in the same direction it has been over the past year?
No. When I met them I heard some of the stuff that they were doing. It was called the Noise. Remember that? It came out after they broke. It was this group, with them and another producer and it was called the Noise. They were a straight kind of R&B, just really light and kind of candlelight… [sings] “I wanna see you in your birthday suit”… And I was just like, “Aw, fuck that shit. No man, let's talk about, fuckin' and getting too high and trying to fuck bitches and it's not working out. Let's get really grimy about it."
Do you feel like Abel's lyrical content changed in line with the production? In other words, they aren't talking about fuckin' and suckin' and getting ripped until shortly after you met him?
They had a lot of stuff written. They always had something written in their Blackberry or something. I'm not saying they were a really light guy or anything like that. They had [the writing] in there, but a lot of it was in the form of raps.
And obviously he's not a rapper.
They can rap. I produced the entirety of an album, but it wasn't really going in a good direction so we scrapped most of it. They rapped on about a third of it.
What was your personal relationship like with Abel during this period? Would you say you were friends?
We were just trying to work on music. We were also partying a lot. We became pretty good friends, hanging out every day. At first it was working pretty well, but then I don't know if it was a change in their heart or the people around Abel trying to guide him, but they were starting to push for doing club tracks and I didn't really want to [do that]. We started as a group; it was they and I, and we called ourselves “The Weekend.” I came up with that name, by the way.
How did the “e” get dropped?
Well, I left. They dropped the “e.” But they were pushing for some things I didn't want to do, and it got to the point where they wouldn't respect my opinion. They wanted me to produce for them without any of my input. And I was like, “Well then, what's the point of being a group?” and they were like, “You can just be my producer,” and I said, “Are you going to pay me?” Then [I realized they are] not going to pay me. That's why I backed out. I was like, “You can have those three or four tracks, I'll give you the stems, just take 'em, but I don't want to work with you anymore.” I was really congenial about it, but I told him, “Just make sure that you give me credit,” and that's where things went sour.
And, of course, that's when things exploded and bloggers started writing about the music.
We knew that it was getting around to some of the smaller blogs and stuff, and just as I backed out, Drake threw up the tracks. Then the New York Times article and everything else started blowing up. I was like, “Fuck.” It started popping off. I sent them an email: “Remember! Give me credit!”
Did Abel respond?
No. I've never heard from them since I told them I didn't want to work with them anymore.
If you Google around a bit, there are certain blogs that do give you credit—the early adopters, I guess.
Yeah, but that's because they were the ones who were [up on us immediately]. It was Jeremy Rose and Abel Tesfaye. It took a long time for it to turn around because it was all word of mouth. To the early blogs, I was still part of the group. But then when the New York Times and all the big guys started covering it—
They were writing about it like it was some mysterious project, like Daft Punk or something. “Who is the Weeknd?”
It was just Abel and theirs tracks...
Yeah and this hot-shit unknown producer. A lot of people started claiming that 40 [Drake's engineer] was making the beats.
Yeah...
Did that piss you off?
I was flattered that I was being compared to 40, but at the same time, I wasn't getting any recognition! I didn't want to go out of my way and be like, “No! I did it!” because I feel like that would have looked bad. So I was pretty quiet about it.
Were your friends and other people around you encouraging you to say something? To call them out?
Oh, yeah. Everybody around me knew what was going on and thought it was bullshit. But I was just trying to take the higher ground because they [Abel and their people] were being bitches about it. I wasn't even going to get into it.
Has Drake ever contacted you about anything? Have they ever acknowledged your existence and input?
They know. I heard that they know I'm around, and I heard through my manager that 40's manager really likes my shit. I hear that from a lot of people, other producers...
Yeah, but what does that mean at the end of the day?
What does it mean? Fuckin' give me money [laughs].
So you haven't received a cent from anything the Weeknd has released?
No, not yet. We'll work on it.

Oakland arrests undermine the public trust in police
Mayor Jean Quan hoping new pact paves the way for labor peace. Chronicle photo by Paul Chinn Mayor Jean Quan hoping new pact paves the way for labor peace. Chronicle photo by Paul Chinn Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Oakland arrests undermine the public trust in police 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Oakland Mayor Jean Quan's response to the rising tide of violence in the city apparently was to round up the usual suspects and tout the arrests of eight unnamed people as a major bust under Operation Ceasefire.
Yet, when the Oakland police finally named the eight, they weren't the ones whose arrests the police had trumpeted at an earlier press conference. Further, they had no central connection to the mayor's keystone crime-fighting program, Operation Ceasefire.
This operation now appears to be one of misinformation - or perhaps disinformation - and has only served to further undermine public trust in the police and the mayor.
The mayor says the police spokesperson read out the wrong list of names, and the whole incident "seems to be an honest mistake."
Mistake or not, the incident raises troubling questions about the city's ability to use Operation Ceasefire to address widespread property crime and gang violence, including the murder of a baby and an 8-year-old girl. Also disturbing is the notion that the city would think it could set aside one of our most basic democratic protections: that people do not disappear into the hands of the police. Americans expect the police to name whom they have arrested and why.
For their part, the mayor says, they aren't involved in the details, but the police have acknowledged the mistake of releasing the wrong names. "I was on vacation or in Washington," they said.
In March, the city adopted Operation Ceasefire, patterned on a federal program used to some success in other cities, after an earlier crime-busting program failed to launch. In April, the city identified 14 gangs and hundreds of gang members and began calling gang leaders to put them on notice that they must reduce criminal activity or face arrest.
On Aug. 14-15, the police arrested eight men but then refused to release their names at a press conference called to publicize the results of the sweep. This week the police released eight names of men arrested and charged with multiple felonies, but a Chronicle check of the arrest records revealed that these men were arrested in subsequent raids. Those arrested on Aug. 14-15 were charged with lesser crimes, including suspicion of robbery and selling marijuana.
The mayor downplayed the mistake and focused on the subsequent felony arrests. "They made a good bust," they said.
It's a sad commentary on the state of Oakland leadership that ineptitude would appear to be the most favorable explanation for why journalists were given inaccurate information about one of the mayor's priority public-safety projects.
For more than a decade, “Lieutenant” Gregory Allen pumped up young military hopefuls at their gym in San Rafael, California. The bulky and bald-headed drill sergeant told war stories from their stint in Vietnam, collected donations, and even posed for photos in a U.S. Marines uniform with a Purple Heart and Bronze star.
The only problem: the Marine Corps says Allen, 67, never served. Now the wannabe jarhead is under investigation by the FBI and Department of Veterans Affairs for allegedly faking their entire military record.
The sham soldier's fall from grace came last week, after one former Marine's own detective work prompted the federal probe.
“He's helping young people who want to join the Marine Corps, but they were doing it through lies and deception,” said James Brown, the watchdog who tipped off authorities.
Allen did not return e-mails or messages left at their gym or cellphone.
More than 100 young men and women have graduated from Allen's House of Steel, a sweaty, no-nonsense gym in Marin County—known as one of the wealthiest and more liberal corners of America.
Some of Allen's “recruits” stay with the regimen all through high school. In a March 29 post on the House of Steel Facebook page, “1Lt Gregory Allen” congratulates 18-year-old Chris Vogt, a member for five years, for shipping off to training in San Diego.
“He continues to help at the HOS with the daily functions,” Allen wrote. “Chris is like a son to me. I have watched them grow and become a great young man. God Bless Him and their Family.”
In a 2010 profile on House of Steel, Allen said civilians and aspiring military officers could only join the gym after a tryout. “Usually people off the street don't make it here,” Allen told the Marin Independent Journal. “They respond with fear and shock if they haven't been warned. We get one out of five who make it.”
The gruff, light-eyed Allen looks likes drill sergeant straight out of “Full Metal Jacket.” They played their part so well that they became the president of the Marin chapter of Military Officers Association of America. Their gym-rat recruits served as the color guard and drill team at local events.
“He fooled a lot of us,” John Sammons, a past president of Marin's Military Officers Association, told The Daily Beast. “He walked the walk, they talked the talk, they wore the uniform. There's an honor [code]. Someone comes up to you and says, ‘I'm a former commissioned officer,' we don't ask for their [discharge papers].”
But Allen's story publicly unraveled after a Bay Area TV reporter exposed their dubious military career Friday. They never served in the Marines or in Vietnam, and never received any medals, ABC 7 discovered through a records request.
Instead, the poser Marine enlisted in the Navy in 1968 but was discharged after eight months because of a knee injury that they sustained playing football prior to enlisting.
When ABC reporter Dan Noyes began probing Allen's phony credentials, Allen told them to get off their property. “I'm done talking with you, partner, back up ... You're down here to do a hit piece on this place,” Allen said.
Meanwhile Allen told a local newspaper asking about their service: “I'm not going to say anything. I'm going to let the lawyer answer these questions.”
Earlier this month, Allen asked clients not to answer questions from Noyes.
“My heart is troubled and with great sadness I must tell you that the House of Steel is under a vicious and vile assault from newscaster, Dan Noyes,” Allen wrote April 14. “Please do not talk to him. They have just enough information to get themselves into trouble.”
Some supporters did heed Allen's warning. Early defenders told watchdogs that Allen does good things for the community and to leave them alone, said Brown, a former Marine who has outed other military fakers.
Brown teamed up with Noyes to investigate Allen. It all started when the sergeant major for the local Marines asked Brown if they knew who Allen was and why they were taking so much credit for helping young recruits.
Brown told The Daily Beast it wasn't hard to poke holes in Allen's story: pictures of the supposed lieutenant did the work for him. In one online photo, Allen stood next to the flag-draped casket of a fallen Marine, but the medals on Allen's red Marines blazer were out of order. (This Marine was mentored by Allen, and later committed suicide while in the service, Brown said.)
“He's got a combat action ribbon above the Purple Heart and Bronze Star,” said Brown, a board member of the Wine Country Marines. “Anyone fresh out of boot camp would have known that was wrong. Veterans look at ribbons as resumes.”
In some photographs, Allen donned a Marine Corps Rifle Marksman badge, while in others they had a Rifle Expert badge. But Brown says a Marine can't be both once you're a veteran. (“What you have qualified for when you get out of the service, is what you've got for life,” Brown said.)
Allen was also wearing a different number of ribbons in various photos.
The fake Marine couldn't answer questions on the names of their boot camp, class or drill instructors, Brown said.
Adding to the pile of suspicion was the original name of Allen's gym: “Fitness Boutique.” Brown says Allen transformed their business into a military-style stomping ground 10 years ago after fitness boot camps gained popularity.
Allen has a felony record to boot. They served a three-year prison sentence for violating a restraining order in 1997. According to the ABC7 report, Allen climbed to their wife's bedroom window and threatened to cut their throat and shoot them
Still, the faker was somehow able to obtain a VA medical card with Marines insignia and tooled around San Rafael with a veterans' license plate with a Marine Corps emblem. They have a camouflage bumper sticker with the Marines battle cry, “OORAH!” above the words, “I love this job.”
The Department of Veterans Affairs told Brown that Allen's card was valid, but that it was issued at a VA facility from out of state.
“He did enough research and enough study that they could fool the wealthy families that never served in Marin,” Brown said. “But they couldn't get past the real Marine Corps.”
Veterans like Brown are infuriated by Allen's charade. Once a troubled youth whose life was turned around by the Marines, Brown has dedicated their life to giving back to the Marines community and serves on the Palo Alto VA's Veterans Focus Council, assists the VA with outreach, and organizes the Purple Heart Ceremonies and other events.
Brown said some of Allen's recruits were inspired by the bogus lieutenant's tales of being an elite Recon sniper. At least four of those recruits never made it home, Brown said.
“A lot of men joined the military based off the information they gave them, which was all lies,” Brown said. “Some joined special forces Recon, thinking their mentor served in Recon. Four of those young men ended up getting killed in combat.”
“I have to wonder if the experience they pulled from in those life and death moments were at all inspired by their lies and advice they provided to them based on fabrication,” Brown added. “Parents trusted their children with him, and they played God with their lives.”
It's unclear whether Allen will be charged in violation of the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, which makes it a federal crime to fraudulently claim to have received military decorations in order to receive money. A local grocery store, United Markets, donated to House of Steel and touted its “generous fundraising support” for Allen's program in July 2013 circular. Another donor told ABC that they forked over $5,000 to Allen's Marine gym.
Last fall, House of Steel held an annual fundraiser at the Marin Yacht Club at $40 a ticket. The money was to go to shipping care packages to troops overseas and to fund Allen's gym program for Marines.
Brown says they alerted the FBI to Allen's "scheme" in an April 21 e-mail to David J. Johnson, special agent in charge of the bureau's San Francisco Division.
"He runs a for-profit business. A gym," Brown wrote of Allen. "And their scheme is that he's a decorated Marine Veteran, Special Forces and wears the uniform regularly to support this claim. They do not have a 501(C)3 but holds regular fundraising activities."
For Sammons, the allegations against Allen were heartbreaking. They want to defend Allen's work, as their acolytes often graduated at the top of their platoons.
They cannot, however, forgive the falsely-obtained bronze star medal, with a V for Valor, awarded for heroism during combat. Sammons has presented the American flag to fallen soldiers' next of kin.
“He stole my valor, yeah, sure, so be it on that one,” Sammons, who served as a Marine in Vietnam, told the Daily Beast. “But have you ever been to a military funeral? To me, stolen valor is any time someone is wearing something they don't deserve. They have stolen the valor not only of the person that's in the casket but every other person who's been buried under that flag.”

"Carrot Men in the Rocks" This panel is several miles south of Rangely, Colorado, in a sandstone overhang on a small wash. It is referred to as the "carrot men" site.
The Carrot Men Site is number 16 on the Rangely Rock Art Tour near Rangely, Colorado. The site is listed as Moon Canyon on the National Register of Historic Places and is considered an important resource in the work of discovering more about the early inhabitants of Western Colorado. Signs of habitation date from the Archaic Period (3000 BCE - 100 CE) up to the Ute Period (1300+ CE). More detail The red carrot men loom largest among the images. A close examination reveals that while the main portions of the carrot men were done with red iron ore pigments other colours are present, including green, blue and black, in places like their headdresses and body areas. These blue images (left) may have been done with azurite which is quite rare in this area. That might possibly signify trade with other people or distant travels. (photos courtesy of ghikes.com)
Cloning Experiments In an interesting 1958 experiment, F.E. Steward, a biologist working in the Lab of Cell Physiology, Growth, and Development at Cornell University succeeded in growing a complete carrot plant from a fully differentiated carrot root cell.
Steward literally shook apart cells from a carrot root and placed these individual cells in a rotation tube containing cell nutrients. The cells surprisingly began to divide and grew to form tissues. Some cell masses broke from the tissues and grew their own roots. When these massed were planted in soil, they developed into complete carrot plants. Steward's results surprised biologists because at the time it was thought individual differentiated cells would not divide and grow to form complete organisms. After the failure of Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King and other scientists to clone animals from differentiated cells, Steward's results led some scientists to hold on to the belief that cloning from differentiated cells was not biologically impossible
Can you get high on Carrot Seed?
Daucus has been reported to contain acetone, asarone, choline, ethanol, formic acid, HCN, isobutyric acid, limonene, malic acid, maltose, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pyrrolidine, and quinic acid. Reviewing research on myristicin, which occurs in nutmeg, mace, black pepper, carrot seed, celery seed, and parsley, Buchanan (J. Food Safety 1: 275, 1979) noted that the psychoactive and hallucinogenic properties of mace, nutmeg, and purified myristicin have been studied. It has been hypothesized that myristicin and elemicin can be readily modified in the body to amphetamines. Handling carrot foliage, especially wet foliage, can cause irritation and vesication. Sensitized photosensitive persons may get an exact reproduction of the leaf on the skin by placing the leaf on the skin for awhile, followed by exposure to sunshine

And when they return from Outer Space, what do they ask for? ..... Carrots :
Associated Press Writer Mike Schneider explained on Wed Apr 5, 2006:-
CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida. - After more than six months in orbit, returning U.S. astronaut Bill McArthur longs for two simple pleasures: a hot cup of fresh coffee and a carrot!!!.
"Life up here is an extraordinary experience ... but we miss the richness, the texture, the three-dimensional nature of living on our home planet," McArthur said Wednesday in an interview from the international space station with The Associated Press and the Houston Chronicle.
"I'm a big coffee drinker and I always like a nice hot cup of coffee in the morning," they said. "The coffee on board tastes good but it's all in bags."
McArthur will fly back Saturday on a Soyuz spacecraft, landing in the steppes of Kazakhstan. Also aboard will be Russian flight engineer Valery Tokarev and Marcos Pontes, Brazil's first man in space.
McArthur and Tokarev have been at the space station more than six months. They are being replaced by Russian commander Pavel Vinogradov and U.S. flight engineer Jeff Williams, who arrived at the station with Pontes last Friday.
McArthur said they also are looking forward to biting into a crunchy salad and feeling "that sensation of pressing into a nice fresh lettuce or a nice raw carrot."
This week, the crew tested a new method of preparing for spacewalks and produced sufficient data, even though the test was cut short, McArthur said.
Before beginning spacewalks, crew members usually have to breathe pure oxygen for several hours to purge their body of nitrogen and prevent a condition known as the bends. The new method could reduce that preparation time.
McArthur and Williams had planned to spend eight hours sleeping in an airlock. But the test was stopped after five hours when two alarms went off while the astronauts slept.
The alarms were triggered by a software glitch that gave an erroneous message about oxygen pressure.
"We were never in any danger," McArthur said. "There was never any problem with the atmosphere."
Carrots in Space (2)
Fresh Food for Astronauts on Its Way - CHICAGO-
New research indicates that astronauts will soon have their own gardens aboard the International Space Station with the ability to grow vitamin A-rich carrots in space, according to a study in the Journal of Food Science, published by the Institute of Food Technologists. Researchers from Tuskegee University in Alabama conducted a study targeted at finding a way to incorporate natural and fresh antioxidants into the diets of astronauts while travelling in space.
They grew 18 different varieties of hydroponic carrots using two different methods of nutrient delivery. Growing carrots hydroponically cultivates the vegetables by placing the roots in liquid nutrient solutions rather than in soil. Among all foods, carrots have the highest carotenoid content. They also contain a natural pigment known for provitamin A and have been associated with protection against cancer, cardiovascular diseases, cataracts and macular degeneration as well as enhancing the immune response. Astronauts can be exposed to elevated levels of radiation, which might put them at risk for some types of cancer. Researchers believe that the addition of unprocessed carrots to their diets may help reduce the negative effects of radiation and cancer development. The
Hydroponically grown carrots were issued nutrients in two different methods. One method is the nutrient film technique (NFT), in which the roots were exposed to a nutrient solution within a plastic film trough. The second method is the microporous tube membrane system (MTMS), in which nutrient tubes were embedded into Turface, a material similar to crushed clay, where the carrots were planted. All carrots were harvested 70 days after planting. They were tested for moisture, fat and carotene content as well as colour and texture. Consumer testing also occurred to test the acceptability of the hydroponic carrots.
This group evaluated colour, crunchiness, sweetness, fibrousness, blandness and overall preference of the 18 different carrot types grown using NFT and MTMS. The study concluded that hydroponic carrots grown using the MTMS method were most appealing to consumers due to their colour and more carrot-like appearance. Moisture contents were similar among all hydroponic carrots as was the carotene content. Lead researcher A.C. Bovell-Benjamin stated, The Nevis-F carrot cultivar grown using the NFT method had the highest carotenoid content and acceptability among consumers, and therefore, it will be the most likely choice for inclusion in NASAs food system.
Campaign Carrot Monument
The Carrot Campaign monument, located in Port Hardy, British Columbia Port Hardy is a small community in British Columbia, Canada located on the north-eastern coast of Vancouver Island. Port Hardy has a population of over 4,500.
It is the gateway to Cape Scott Provincial Park on the northern most tip of Vancouver Island. British Columbia provincial highway 19, which stretches from one end of Vancouver Island to the other, ends in Port Hardy, right near Rotary Park. This explains the town's motto, found on a sign entering town, that reads, "where the highway ends and the adventure begins."
If you can't read the sign, it says: The Carrot Campaign - "This carrot, marking the northern end of the island highway, is a symbol of government road building promises, dangled in front of north island settlers since 1897. The successful late 1970's 'Carrot Campaign' was aimed at making the government keep promises of a completed island highway."
There was no highway connecting the northern end of the island to the rest of the southern communities up until 1979. The only infrastructure, logging roads, in place was built and funded by private logging companies, coupled with a ferry system.
What is more, companies decided to hike prices to local ferries. Residents were in an outcry, so much so the ferry company immediately reduced fare prices to appease the northern communities. North islanders had to navigate a network of unpaved dirt roads to reach the closest community to the south, Campbell River. Naturally, residents grew tired of it.
In 1976, the North Island Gazette wrote a damning headline targeted at the provincial government, Do you carrot at all? This slogan was born out of a response to funding cuts for the highway. Residents would send carrots to the provincial capital as a reminder that there was still no finished highway, but more importantly it kept pressure on the politicians.
The island highway ends with the carrot. And theres a reason as to why theres a piece bitten out of it  a commemorative symbol that residents wanted a finished highway. We want the rest of the carrot another slogan reads Build the North Island highway. And they finally got it in 1979.
As I noted the other day, Greg Mankiw (pdf), in their defense of the one percent, seems oddly oblivious, among other things, to the extent to which America has changed since they were young. We are a much more unequal society now, and as a consequence arguably one with a lot less intergenerational mobility too.
I argued this impressionistically — but it turns out that Miles Corak has a paper for the same volume making the argument with lots of evidence. For example, here's data on “enrichment expenditures”, defined as “the amount of money families spend per child on books, computers, high-quality child care, summer camps, private schooling, and other things that promote the capabilities of their children”:

Not only do the affluent spend much more on their children, but the gap has grown a lot since Greg and I were young. Maybe all that spending is wasted — but I doubt it. We have become both a more unequal society and a society with more unequal opportunities.
There's a lot more in the Corak paper, by the way. I was especially struck by the comparison of mobility in the US and Canada. I wasn't surprised that America has less mobility, and certainly not that in America it's hard to escape the bottom decile. But it turns out that in America it's also much easier to stay in the top decile — hardly the image of a meritocractic society, unless you believe that America's top decile is genetically superior to Canada's.
Anyway, we are not the society we once were — and baby boomers should realize that.
Until 1951, motion pictures were filmed on nitrocellulose which is highly flammable. When it burns, it produces oxygen as a byproduct, so dousing it with water won't put the fire out. In fact, when “nitrate film” catches fire, it is very hard to extinguish; film projection rooms, in order to keep the fire from spreading, were often coated in asbestos. On top of that, nitrate film, as it degrades, is known to spontaneously combust. All together, a lot of old films — especially silent films — are lost forever.
And many more would have been lost, except for an odd little quirk which sent them almost into the Arctic Circle.
If you want to watch the silent films Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1928), The Great Gatsby (1926), or El Apostol (1917, and the first animated feature film ever made), the sad truth is that you can't. All three are widely agreed upon to be gone forever. The last known copy of El Apostol, for example, was in producer Federico Valle's private collection, but — as you may have guessed — burned when Valle's studio caught fire. This wasn't a terribly uncommon occurrence, and because of this, many of the first significant films in motion picture history are long gone. Per one estimate, 85-90% of movies from the silent film era are gone.
But in 1896 a seemingly unrelated thing happened — someone found gold in the Yukon. The Klondike Gold Rush (better known as the Alaska Gold Rush in the United States) began as tens of thousands went north, settling at the confluence of the Klondike and Yukon Rivers. That area became known as Dawson City, Yukon, and was home to as many as 40,000 people that year. While the town's population would quickly wane to 5,000 by the time the town incorporated in 1902, it was significant enough to warrant attention from the media and entertainment industry. Many silent films made their way to the town, but the cost and difficulty of transporting them to the icy northwest was considerable. Movies sent to Dawson City went there at the end of their tenures as actively featured films; the Dawson City library was the final intended destination of hundreds such films.
For some reason — this is speculation, but it's probably a bad idea to have hundreds of highly flammable time bombs in a library full of (paper) books — many of the films were dumped into a condemned, empty swimming pool in 1929. An ice hockey rink was built above them, and they fell out of the memories of society, effectively lost like all the others. But in 1978, the city decided to build a new recreational complex on the same site, and a bulldozer digging a new foundation came across this treasure trove of film-making history. The permafrost had kept the movies in decent-enough condition, and roughly 500 films were saved.
Bonus fact : In 1939, an author named Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a 50,110 word novel titled Gadsby. The story is about a man, the protagonist John Gadsby, who builds up their small town of Branton Hills into a city of over 60,000 residents. The book itself, though, isn't all that good, using some odd language and curious turns of phrase. This isn't a knock on the author, though — the odd linguistics were intentional. Gadsby, by design, never uses the letter “e.”

CHAPEL Hill, N.C. – North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky received a first-round grade from the NFL's college advisory committee earlier this month, although the junior quarterback does not expect to make a decision about their future until after UNC's Sun Bowl appearance on Dec. 30.
Various mock drafts have Trubisky going in the top-10 of the NFL Draft. WalterFootball.com has the Mentor, Ohio native going to San Francisco with the second overall pick, while CBS Sports has them going fourth to Chicago.
The college advisory committee includes NFL personnel evaluators as well as directors from the league's sanctioned scouting organizations, National Football Scouting and BLESTO. The committee researches possible early entrants and provides one of three ratings: potential first round, potential second round, or neither, which is considered to be a recommendation to stay in school. Over 90 percent of the players graded as first- or second-round picks by the advisory committee in 2014-15 (38-of-42) were drafted in the first or second rounds, according to the NFL.
“It's just a first-round grade and I'm trying to see if I can get more in-depth information around it,” Trubisky said on Monday.
The first-round grade is an average of scouting grades, so Trubisky and their family are trying to determine how many teams potentially had them graded as a second-round pick.  They are still acquiring information from various sources, including NFL players that have been in similar situations.
“I'm not letting it take up too much of my time or letting it stress me out that much,” Trubisky said. “I'm just trying to gain as much information as possible and trying to figure out what's best for me, but at the same time, just staying focused for the bowl game.”
UNC head coach Larry Fedora is also searching out more information as it becomes available regarding their junior signal-caller, who has completed 68.9 percent of their passes for 3,468 yards, 28 touchdowns and four interceptions in 2016.
“He's got a decision to make and will make it at some point,” Fedora said. “My role in that is to give them as much information as possible and to support them and their family in their decision. I am sure that they will make a very good, educated decision because he's got a very thorough process.”
What Fedora has yet to offer is their advice, and that's because Trubisky has yet to ask for it.
“I just haven't asked for it yet because I might be afraid of the answer and I might be afraid that it will persuade me one way or the other,” Trubisky said. “But I appreciate Coach Fedora and the rest of the coaching staff for supporting me and that they're going out of their way to provide a lot of information for me in my decision… I think I'm going to ask for that eventually because that will definitely play a factor in my decision.”
Given their draft stock and the temptation of guaranteed millions of dollars, as well as the knowledge that UNC will have to replace at least six offensive starters next season, their decision might seem to be a mere formality. Trubisky insists that's not the case, however, stressing that their ongoing development is a key variable in the equation.
“What is going to make me the best quarterback possible?” Trubisky said. “A lot of people have been telling me that I can get to the NFL, but do I want to just get there, or do I want to put myself in the best position to really excel at the next level? That may be leaving now, or that may be coming back, so those are some of the things I'm thinking about.
“What's going to put me in the best position to have a long-term sustainable career and be the best quarterback I can possibly be?”
Trubisky plans to discuss the available information with their family following UNC's bowl game and hopes to have a decision at least a week before the NFL deadline for underclassmen to file declaration papers, which is Jan. 16.

High quality and authentic metal coins for the game player who wants the best.
Kickstarter exclusive! These coins won't be sold after the campaign.
Dragon "Gold" Fortia Facta Fantasy Coin
My wife and I love to play board games. One game that we play often is Talisman. If you've played Talisman you know gaining gold is part of the game, as it is with many, many, other games.
We also love coins and the Talisman plastic coins just weren't cutting it for us. So we went searching for a metal coin that would hit the mark... something that wasn't too big, or too small and had a nice fantasy "gold" coin feel to it. While we found lots of coins, most everything really didn't fit quite right... lots of mass produced made-in-china tokens which were too big and clunky, or coins too small and ill themed.
However we did know of some very nice fantasy coins but the per coin price was a bit steep and the themes not quite generic fantasy enough. So it really got us thinking about how others might like a very cool fantasy "gold" coin to use with their favorite board game, tabletop game, role playing, or LARP game. Given a sufficient order quantity we could get our own coins designed, produced, and in the hands of players at a relatively reasonable cost given the high quality level. Not a mass produced token style, but an authentic feeling coin produced in America with screw press coining equipment... a technique developed in the 15th century.
We had three primary criteria: old-world and authentic looking/feeling, generic fantasy theme, and around dime sized but thicker (as we wanted something substantial, but nothing which would overpower the game play area).
We've been a fan of crowdsource funding for a while now.. I've even tried Kickstarting software/iPad projects in the past, as software development has been my main profession for many years now. I've been involved in producing physical products in the past, and am well experienced in project management and all the details that go into planning and executing a project. And I must say there is a particular joy in having a hand in producing something physical.
The company I'm working with to produce this coin is Shire Post Mint which is based in Arkansas and has produced fantasy coins for many years. One of their more recent projects has been producing licensed fantasy coins of George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire . Tom Maringer is a great guy and has been very helpful in the process of creating our own custom coin.
I really look forward to what I hope is our first successfully funded project. While the project is small, I think it's a good first step in the direction of many projects which I have planned.
Stretch Goal at: $9,450 - More than just gold!
Once funding hits $9,450 we'll add new reward levels which will include "Silver" and Copper versions of coins. Pricing structure will remain, however you'll specify how many of each style you want. For example, if you selected 30 coins reward, you'll be able to tell us you'd like 10 "gold", 10 "silver", & 10 copper (or whatever combination you choose). Coin faces will remain the same, however sizing will vary slightly given that the different alloys behave differently when struck.
Coin Metals:
"Gold" = Brass
"Silver" = Pewter
Copper = Copper
Size comparison
Thickness: ~0.070"
Diameter: ~0.670" to ~0.690"
Bonus #1
+1 coin to all reward levels!
Each reward level will now receive one extra coin. One coin reward is now two, five coins are now six, etc.
Bonus #2
A leather pouch!
This would be perfect to hold your valuable coins! Each reward level will now receive one leather pouch. Pouch size will vary depending on coin count of selected reward.
Bonus #3
All reward levels will receive one hand struck Momodonia coin- "Gold" "Silver" or Copper, randomly chosen.
Momodonia coins struck by NOW'ish games very own gnome workforce exclusively for Kickstarter backers.
Bonus #4
+1 Coin To All Reward Levels!
In addition to all previous bonuses each reward level will now receive one extra coin!

8.0 our score
The X universe in all its depth has probably only been explored by a relatively small percentage of gamers. A pity as the universe is one of the most complex and rich ones you can find in any sci-fi game to date. X3: Terran Conflict is the most recent instalment in the series, and even this latest entry in the series has already reached version 3.0 due to the fanatic support of its developer, Egosoft.
Gameplay
X3 is difficult to explain to people who haven't experienced a game of this kind before. It's essentially a space-based combat and economy simulation. You start in a spaceship which you directly control, with only a few credits to your name. The real goal of the game is determined by you as the player, as the game is essentially a giant sandbox. Most players will aim to make as many credits as they can in order to buy more, bigger and better ships.
The game also features an economic model with space stations in different sectors and from different races requiring certain resources to produce their products. The entire economy works on a supply & demand basis and a player can earn a lot of credits by trading. It's one of my personal preferences, and using a fleet of transport ships to ferry goods all over the universe is a great way to make a lot of credits.
On top of these players are also able to build any of the stations in the game themselves, be it mines on asteroids or full-blown weapon complexes. A complex is essentially multiple space-stations linked together, forming a much larger space station connected by tubes. There is no limit to the amount of stations you can connect this way as long as there is space available in the sector and your hardware is capable of rendering it.
Stations within a complex obviously don't need to have their products transported back and forth, so it's efficient, economic and much safer. Safety is important as the universe is a very dangerous place filled with pirates and some very aggressive alien races who don't warn before they start shooting. I've seen people post complexes with over 400 stations connected to them on the official forums, which is a truly epic undertaking when done in the unmodified game.
Setting
The X3: Terran Conflict universe is extremely rich and diverse – containing several distinct alien races and factions:
Terran – Humans from Earth / The Solar System (and a lost colony called Aldrin)
Argon – Humans
Boron – A friendly, water-based species with ships that resemble fish.
Split – An aggressive race with a family structure (quite Klingon like in that sense) with very fast ships.
Teladi – The mandatory trade oriented race.
Paranid – A very reclusive, paranoid race who don't like outsiders.
Khaak – An insect-like alien race, extremely aggressive and stars of one of the main plot lines. One of two races which are permanent enemies and cannot be befriended.
Xenon – An artificial-intelligence species, extremely aggressive and the other race which cannot be befriended.
A ton of other minor races, including Pirate Factions, the hippy Goners, etc.
Sectors are extremely diverse as well – some including full-blown planets, tons of asteroids, nebulae, etc. etc. There are several sectors which regular players will recognise instantly, despite the universe being HUGE. And I do mean HUGE. Let me stress this again, the universe is fucking HUGE – just check this X3 TC Map.
The game can be played in any way you like, but there currently are 9 major plot lines + a whole range of different corporate missions for different corporations, and hundreds of other randomly generated missions. You can literally play forever if you would want but the game has developed to keep people busy for a long, long time. As an indication, the current game I am playing through has 56 hours on the clock and I've only finished the Terran plot. I've clocked 141 hours in X3: Terran Conflict since I bought it on Steam and played X3: Reunion for over 250 hours prior to that. (TC is essentially an updated engine of X3: R, with different main plot – I'd suggest you go straight into TC.)
Egosoft
It's rare that we specifically speak about a developer during a review but for this game it's absolutely worth doing, as it's extremely relevant to the value for money aspect of our score. Egosoft is absolutely unrivalled when it comes to supporting their games and we don't state this lightly. The community has an enormous influence over the game and their feedback is taken incredibly seriously. Terran Conflict is now at version 3.0 which hasn't been released *that* long ago, despite the game being over 2 years old now. We're not talking just patches or fixes either, but regular addition of new content and new plot lines. It's very refreshing that a developer doesn't do this through expansions or DLC, but provides this content completely for free to people who already own the game.
On top of that, there is a massive modding community with Egosoft taking the most prominent mods which aren't game-breaking or unbalancing to the vanilla experience, and releasing these in the form of a Bonus Pack. This Bonus pack can be downloaded for free, and provides a signed version of these mods without breaking your vanilla game and giving you a ***modified*** tag. This is important for players who wish to upload their statistics to the official website and be ranked among other players on various aspects of the game. This bonus pack is currently already at version v4.1.01.
Ships
It's worth devoting a little section to the type of ships you can fly and own in X3: Terran Conflict as well as it gives a much better idea of the scale and scope of the game. Please note that unlike other games of this type your ships CAN be controlled by the AI so you can own and operate entire wings or fleets if that is your wish. Transports can be automated to perform specific tasks, military ships can patrol sectors, and fighters can be assigned to wings – either your own or entirely separate ones. This can be anywhere in the universe so it is possible to own thousands of ships all across the universe if that is your fancy.
The various ship types;
M5 – Very fast, small scout ships.
M4 – Fast fighters.
M3 – Heavy fighters.
M8 – Bombers.
TS – Freight Transport Ships
TP – Passenger Transport Ships
TM – Military Transport Ships, capable of carrying a handful of fighters.
M6 – Corvette ships, the largest ship which can dock at stations.
M7M – Missile Frigates.
M7 – Frigates.
TL – Large Transports, large enough to transport entire space stations.
M2 – Destroyers, large capital ships with extremely powerful weaponry.
M1 – Carriers, behemoths which can carry several complete wings of fighters.
M0 – Mother ships: extremely rare and not possible to acquire as a player.
All of these ships are scaled very well, so when you are flying your little M4 fighter class ship past a M2 destroyer, you will know your flying past something very large indeed. Owning one of these giants yourself for the first time is a truly momentous occasion. The screenshots below show the scale of an astronaut (me) vs. a relatively small passenger transport ship, through normal perspective followed by a more zoomed out view:
As a comparison your little fighter hull can be acquired for 300,000, possibly even 100,000 credits at a push and a decent space station (a large mine for example) can be purchased for under a million. That M2 is going to set you back around 100 Million without any weapons or equipment, so it's quite an achievement. Of course there are alternative ways of acquiring them, such as piracy, which is why the game has such appeal to many players: you can truly play the way YOU want and the universe will respond accordingly.
Graphics / Sound
The graphics in X3: Terran Conflict are absolutely lovely. Some of the sectors are absolutely stunning, space stations are very well detailed and visually different from race to race in most cases. Stations and ships include moving parts, such as radar dishes, rotating sections (for gravity, think Babylon 5) and moving turrets.
Ships are fantastic, the models are visually different between the races and an experienced player will identify most ships fairly easily. The size and scale of some of the ships and stations is immense – especially when you visit the Terran sectors for the first time. (The ring at Earth is just mind-blowing).
The sounds are generally very good – weapons and explosions sound as you would expect. The verbose computer is able to pronounce most ships and targets, as well as weapons and ship upgrades. It's slightly irritating after you've played for a VERY long time, but then you just switch Betty off. A lovely touch is the station announcements, which provide an additional level of immersion as well as the greeting messages when you dock at a station. Based on your standing with the faction which owns the station, the greeting can be quite different.
The music is in an entirely different league. I *love* the music in X3, and the sectors of the various races have quite a different atmosphere as a result of their background music. Some specific or special sectors have special sound tracks and some of them are plain fantastic. As I've mentioned, between X3:R and X3:TC I must have played over 400 hours and I still play with the music on. I don't think I can give a bigger compliment to the composers.
UI/Controls
This aspect of X3: Terran Conflict is much harder to review. Let me start by saying that the game doesn't have a great interface. There – I said it. It certainly is functional and a lot of the UI choices are actually very good, at least when it comes to piloting your craft and interacting with the ships around you. However, managing your galactic empire and your other crafts can be quite a pain. To give one of your other ships located in another sector a command, you first have to find the ship in your assets list. This luckily has tons of sorting options, but it's still not the best interface I've ever used. Once located, you have to click it – and open a menu which contains TONS and I mean TONS of commands. For a new player, and even for more advanced players, half of these commands make no sense without specifically knowing what they do.
On top of this – the available commands are limited to what software you installed in your ships. To make things worse, some of these upgrades can only be found in specific locations/sectors/race equipment docks, meaning you really need a lot of experience to get ships to do exactly what you want. To give you an example, to start a trader which operates on its own within certain sectors you need Navigation Command Software, Fight Command Software Mk1 and Trade Command Software Mk3. It helps to have a Jumpdrive as well. This upgrade system is one of my biggest annoyances with X3, as equipping new ships for a specific duty can become quite the epic undertaking.
This happens to some extent with weapons/shields as well, but at least the player can build factories to produce these themselves. Ship upgrades can only be acquired from those specific locations, so you need to ferry your ships around. Worse, they cannot be bought in bulk as they are not transportable goods, you must install them in the ship which is going to use them, at the location where they can be purchased. There is a trick to somewhat circumvent that, using a carrier with fighters carrying the upgrades and then transferring these upgrades over, but that's a huge pain in the arse for something that should be a lot easier.
I would also have liked the station and complex construction to be more intuitive, with better visual aids. Equally, management of said stations should have a much easier and slicker interface, as that would have really increased the appeal of the game massively.
That said, this game is HUGELY complex and discovering which command does what is part of the journey you go through when playing X3. You simply don't play this game without consulting the official forums, guides and other available information as there's just too much to see and do. There's a huge universe, hundreds of different ships, dozens of weapons, missiles, ship upgrades and more management commands than I even know about. And that's before you start looking at mods.
Conclusion
X3 is the kind of game you will either love or hate. For those people who like their space simulation, who enjoy the odd bit of trading, combat and immensely in-depth gameplay – X3: Terran Conflict will be a game you will enjoy for hundreds upon hundreds of hours. There's so much content available, and so many different plotlines and activities that I can honestly say one game can easily last you for 200-300 hours. And your game experience can differ significantly based on your relationships with all races or the type of activities you carry out. Elite, Privateer, Eve – they've got nothing on the sort of depth that X3 offers.
Is the game perfect? No, it does have it's flaws – but once you've finished vanilla, got your achievements on Steam and uploaded your statistics on the official website (if you're into that kind of thing), there are hundreds of fantastic mods coming from one of the best communities that can be found online, which will extend the life of your game even further. There's something for everyone, so if you thought specific elements of the game needed changing/upgrading/removing/adding, there's undoubtedly a mod for it.
Just the Babylon 5 mod alone is worth buying X3 for, and that's just one example. So really, my advice is to go buy X3 already!
Meanwhile, I will leave you with two shots of the most beautiful planet of all:
story,interview
Avoid the temptation
Watch a video of children taking the marshmallow test today and one thing becomes obvious: the more exposure to the marshmallow they let themselves have, the more likely they are to eat it. In other words, picking up and sniffing the marshmallow, or pretending to eat it, is not a strategy for staving off the temptation — it's a recipe for giving in imminently.
Kids who turned away from the marshmallow or pushed it farther away, on the other hand, were more successful. And other experiments found that if the marshmallow was covered by by a screen and the kids couldn't see it, they waited ten times longer, on average, before ringing the bell.
The reason, Mischel and other psychologists argue, is that the battle between instant gratification (one marshmallow now) and long-term prudence (two marshmallows later) is really a battle between two different systems of the brain. "There's the limbic system — the lower, more primitive brain, which responds immediately and emotionally, and allowed us as a species to survive a predator-filled environment in ancient times," Mischel says. "Then other parts of the brain, concentrated in the prefrontal cortex, allow us to do things like control our attention, and think about the future, and delay gratification." Neuroscientists often call this the brain's executive function.
In the book, Mischel likens the impulse-driven limbic system to "hot" thinking, and the slower, more rationally-driven executive function to "cool" thinking. These categories may oversimplify — in terms of the underlying brain structures — but they're still a helpful way of understanding our response to different sorts of stimuli. And various experiments have shown that exposure to the sight, smell, or taste of a temptation activate the sort of short-term "hot" thinking that make us most likely to give in to it.
There are all sorts of lessons for adults here, Mischel writes. If you're trying to quit smoking, surrounding yourself with smokers will inevitably drain your willpower and make you more likely to have a cigarette. "This is the reason why, even if you have resolutions about how many potato chips you're going to eat, once you open the bag, it's so hard to not empty it. It's because they taste good," they say. "Once you're focusing on that — rather than the long-term issues of cholesterol and obesity — it's incredibly hard to stop."
Distract yourself
One of the most amusing aspects of watching marshmallow test videos is the things kids do to occupy themselves instead of eating. "They take off their shoes and play with their toes as if they were piano keys. They're inventing little songs, or exploring their nasal cavities," Mischel says. Sometimes, "they engage in Charlie Chaplin-like monologues, reminding themselves, 'If I ring the bell, then I don't get the two marshmallows.'"
These sorts of activities are adorable. But they're also an interesting look at a crucial strategy. In a sense, it's the flip side of avoiding temptation: distracting oneself by doing or thinking about something else entirely.
When children were told to conjure a fun memory, they waited ten times longer than otherwise
In experiments, when the researchers suggested that the children conjure a fun memory before leaving them alone, the kids waited about ten times longer before ringing the bell than otherwise. On the other hand, suggesting that the kids think about the delicious taste of the marshmallow pretty much guaranteed they'd ring the bell or eat it immediately.
The lesson is that daydreaming or distracting yourself — instead of directly thinking about the temptation — is a way of quelling the sort of "hot" thinking that leads to giving in. This, too, can be useful to adolescents and adults as well as five-year-olds, regardless of the temptation at hand.
Mentally transform your temptation
One of factors that helped kids most effectively delay gratification was remarkably simple. "If the child looked at the cookie but pretended it weren't real — they were told beforehand to put an imaginary picture frame around it and pretend it was just a picture — the child who would previously ring the bell within 30 seconds could now wait 10 or 15 minutes, on average," Mischel says.
Simply transforming the desired object inside your brain affects your response to it — and how much willpower it will require to abstain. An adult might not be as easily persuaded that a tempting item is simply a picture, but it can be transformed in plenty of other ways. "For instance, instead of a drug being a fantastic high, pretend it's a poison," Mischel says. "How you think about it makes a huge difference in cooling your desire for it."
This sort of mental transformation is often more effective than thinking about long-term consequences. "To cool your desire for a piece of chocolate fudge, instead of thinking about your next blood test, just imagine that a cockroach nibbled on it," Mischel suggests. This is why, in other countries, cigarette packs often come with graphic photos of cancer-scarred lungs, rather than mere text.
Many psychologists argue that our sense of disgust evolved to protect us from unsanitary foods. If that's the case, triggering a feeling of disgust might be effective because it taps into the power of the impulse-driven "hot" thinking, but instinctively pushes us in the opposite direction.
This sort of thinking can even be leveraged to make long-term priorities seem more like urgent temptations. One recent study, for instance, found that people committed 30 percent more money towards their 401(k) savings accounts if they saw a photo of themselves that had been digitally altered to look about 68 years old. Just being able to see themselves in old age made the need to save for retirement seem much more urgent.
Create an "if-then" plan
"If-then" planning is now a tenet of many productivity coaches, but Mischel observed it way back in the 1970s, as part of an experiment that came shortly after the marshmallow tests.
In the experiment, four- and five-year-olds were put in a room with something called Mr. Clown Box — essentially, a talking, light-up box with toys that invited kids to come play with it. Like the marshmallow test, they were told that if they could ignore the short-term temptation (and complete a more boring task), they'd be rewarded later (by getting to play with both the clown and other toys).
These young children understandably had a tough time completing their boring task. But they were dramatically more successful when the researchers suggested that if the clown talked to them, they should do something specific, like turn away from it, or tell it to shut up. In essence, this is rudimentary "if-then" planning — explicitly creating a plan to follow in the event of a specific stimulus.
"The lesson that comes out of that, and has now been studied by other people in great detail, is that very simple "if-then" plans work," Mischel says. "For instance, 'If the alarm rings at 7:00, then I will get out of bed — I won't hit snooze. If I am working on a homework assignment, then I will turn off my phone.'"
This seems simple, but research has shown it's dramatically more effective than vaguer sorts of resolutions on a consistent basis. One study found that 91 percent of participants who created an if-then exercise plan ('If it's a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, then I will go to the gym') stuck with it, compared with just 39 who created a vague plan ('I will go to the gym more often'). "Articulating targeted plans beforehand, based on the areas of our lives in which we want to exert self-control, makes a huge difference," Mischel says.
Minimize stress
Many different experiments have shown that, both in kids and adults, high levels of stress increase the chance we'll give in to short-term "hot" impulses instead of prioritizing long-term "cool" thinking. fMRI studies have also shown that stress affects the prefrontal cortex — the region most heavily involved in long-term thinking — more detrimentally than any other area of the brain.
Over time, chronic levels of high stress appear to alter the structure of this area, disrupting someone's baseline capacity to engage in long-term thinking even on a non-stressful day. "Kids who are living under chronic stress have to get help in having that reduced to do well in school," Mischel says. In other words, children dealing with a difficult home life can't just suddenly turn on the ability to control themselves and concentrate on a lesson when they enter the schoolhouse door. (Somewhat related is the fact that, as Mischel found and other scientists have since confirmed, kids growing up in unstable home settings are less likely to delay gratification for a good reason: there's no guarantee that an adult is telling the truth about the two marshmallows later.)
This goes for adults as well, and explains why many of us find ourselves giving in to temptation during difficult times — whether it's something as mundane as stress-eating or more destructive long-term decisions.
Self-control is more important than you realize
The marshmallow test is famous not because of the self-control strategies it's taught us, but because of the striking way it has served as an indicator of its subjects long-term success.
"We found that there are correlations between the number of seconds a child delayed the marshmallow for, and outcomes in early adolescence, including early SAT scores, and teacher and parent ratings of how well the children were doing socially and cognitively in their teens," Mischel says. Teens who had waited longer for the marshmallow also reported they were better at dealing with stress and frustration.
Adults who had waited longer as children were better at pursuing long-term goals
Later, the researchers found, adults who had waited longer reported they were better at pursuing long term goals and were found to have lower body mass indexes and were less likely to use drugs. Even more recently, brain scans of the adults who'd waited longest as kids and those who waited least showed differences in prefrontal cortex activity.
In short, being able to choose two marshmallows later instead of one marshmallow now turns out to be crucial in navigating many of life's biggest challenges. "The stuff needed to delay gratification on the marshmallow test — namely, executive function — is exactly what's needed for school success," Mischel says. Kids who have that are "ready to learn, to focus on the teacher, to concentrate, to not become distracted, to keep the goal in mind."
This also applies to many other areas. "As we grow up, we have to deal with not only not gobbling up every temptation that's in sight, but we have to be able to control our negative emotions," Mischel says. "We won't do well in kindergarten if, every time we become angry, we punch everyone around us. So the ability to recognize and inhibit one's own negative emotions is another part of executive function."
But self-control isn't a fixed trait
This is the thing that many people have gotten wrong about the marshmallow test. It may be true that, on the whole, children who waited longer for the marshmallow did better, by some measures, later in life.
But the test wasn't designed to "pass" or "fail" kids. It was designed to see what circumstances and strategies make delaying easier, and which make it harder. And more than anything, it shows that self-control is a mutable skill that's highly dependent on the choices we make and the conditions we find ourselves in. It's not a fixed trait like height or eye color, but something that we can all constantly work on — like, say, the ability to play the piano.
"For me, the marshmallow test is not an indicator that our futures are already determined when we're four years old, but that our potential for maximizing our lives involves a set of skills that are already visible and teachable at age four," Mischel says. "[It] involves a set of skills that can be taught, and learned. They're acquirable. Nothing is predetermined."

Welcome back to the Short Fiction Spotlight, a space for conversation about recent and not-so-recent short stories. For December, I talked about The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2015 edited by John Joseph Adams and Joe Hill—and this time, I'd like to look at another installment in the “Destroy…” series of special issue magazines, Queers Destroy Fantasy. Christopher Barzak edits the original short fiction, while Liz Gorinsky takes care of the reprint fiction; Matt Cheney is the editor for the nonfiction.
This is a more compact issue than a few of its predecessors, but the mix of styles and tones conveying the “fantasy” motif worked well together to create a fairly balanced reading experience. There are four original pieces and four reprints, plus a novel excerpt for Charlie Jane Anders's upcoming All the Birds in the Sky. Since I'll be discussed that book as a whole soon enough, I'd like to focus on just the short fiction offerings this time around (and though the nonfiction isn't under the remit of this column, it's definitely worth checking out too).
The first piece of original fiction, “The Lily and the Horn” by Catherynne M. Valente (illustrated by Goñi Montes), has the feel of a lushly illustrated vignette—a captured moment full of nostalgia and poetry, though little traditional movement. The action is a held-breath build: waiting for the protagonist's lover, a woman whom they went to a sort of poisoner's finishing school with, to arrive to “battle” them (though the two will not speak or touch or interact, and it's all via proxy). That moment of breathless waiting, kept apart by politics and the nature of marriages for those politics, is the centerpiece of the story, and it works. The imagery is also quite stunning, so the poetics of the piece are well executed.
Then there's “Kaiju maximus®: ‘So Various, So Beautiful, So New'” by Kai Ashante Wilson (illustrated by Odera Igbokwe)—a story I found intriguing in part for the fact that it's about a couple whom one might consider, in some manner, straight. Except there's an intense reversal of gendered expectations between the hero and the hero's beloved, and that's what gives the story its punch. The world presented in it is also intriguing: the kaiju, the video-game references and the scientific asides, all give us an odd sense of unreality against the backdrop of nomadic familial struggle, a relationship that is fraught and dangerous, and the emotional core of sacrifice that the protagonist is made for. I liked it, though I did feel that I'd have liked more out of the story—it's doing a lot of interesting things, but still seemed a bit unbalanced at the end in terms of development of its themes and threads.
Our next piece has a more horror-story vibe: “The Lady's Maid” Carlea Holl-Jensen. It's got some Countess Bathory-esque weirdness, and the erotic relationship between the Lady and their maid is even more bizarre and discomfiting. It also treads a line of sadism and nonconsensual interaction that gives the horror a further edge of squick, though there seem to be hints that the Lady is perfectly aware of the things that happen if they take their head off and leaves the maid reign over their body. All the same, it's got one strong central visual and a powerful twist of body-horror; as a story, though, it didn't necessarily hold my attention and interest throughout.
“The Dutchess and the Ghost” by Richard Bowes (illustrated by Elizabeth Leggett) is the only one of the four original stories that has a traditional sense of plot arc and a solid conclusion that, nonetheless, leaves the reader pleasantly thoughtful. Having thought it over for a bit, I suspect this is actually my favorite piece of the bunch: it deals with being queer and running away to New York in the early sixties, the cost of freedom, and the cost of being one's own self. There's an unvarnished handsomeness to the narrator's descriptions that lends the piece an honest, realist air, even though it's about ghosts and time and death. It blends together its fantastical elements with its mundanity very well.
There are also the four reprints, curated by Liz Gorinsky. “The Padishah Begum's Reflections” by Shweta Narayan (illustrated by Sam Schecter) was originally published in Steam-Powered: Lesbian Steampunk Stories edited by JoSelle Vanderhooft (2011); unsurprisingly, it is a lesbian steampunk story. More interesting is the approach to the trope. Narayan gives us a perspective on the Napoleonic conflict through the lens of mechanical Empress Jahanara—who doesn't really have a lot of patience for the petty squabbles of Europeans, but is more concerned with securing their kingdom and the love of the French artisan and craftswoman whom she's had a long epistolary communication with. I do appreciate the sense of building a woman's world the way that Jahanara does, as well. This is a feel-good story, rather sweet, though the steampunk thing doesn't do it for me much.
“Down the Path of the Sun” by Nicola Griffith was originally published in Interzone (1990). After the plague, our protagonist is living with their mother and younger sister; their lover Fin also lives with their female relatives. Things have been peaceful until the sudden and brutal assault and murder of the protagonist's little sister by a roving gang. The description of loss and trauma is intense, here. Griffith has a handle on the things that dig under a reader's skin like fish-hooks. It's short but evocative.
Originally published in One Story (2006), “Ledge” by Austin Bunn (illustrated by Vlada Monakhova) takes the idea of the edge of the world and makes it real: the sailors in this piece discover the path to purgatory over the ledge, and bring back lost souls of the dead. The idea is interesting, but I found myself a little frustrated that it's another piece where historical homophobia is The Thing. While the ending here is the strong point—it manages to encompass the horror of defeating death alongside the joy of it—I thought the piece itself ran rather slow.
The short fiction ends with “The Sea Troll's Daughter” by Caitlín Kiernan, from Swords & Dark Magic: The New Sword and Sorcery (2010), and it was the best of the bunch in the reprints. Kiernan's “hero” is a drunk, the barmaid is more of a hero in their fashion, and none of the traditional high-fantasy tropes come out in the wash: the sea troll's daughter isn't a nemesis, the town elders don't have a reward to give, and nobody's doing a particularly great job at anything. It's all mundane failure in a fantastical setting, and I appreciate that cleverness; it reminds me a bit of Kiernan's take on urban fantasy as a genre in their Siobhan Quinn novels.
Overall, the Queers Destroy Fantasy! special issue is a decent read. I'd have like to see a little more tonal variation, but the topics and approaches to the fantastic were different enough to remain enticing—a solid installment in the series, though I'd hoped for a bit more out of it. The stories are good, but for the most part not spectacular; worth reading, though.

This is my original Fantroll, Karaka Shaman!
Bio:
Age: 6(.92) Sweeps [15 Earth years]
Blood Color: Black
Symbol:
Title: Princess of Shadow
Planet: Land of Blood and Wrath
Screen Name: daddysMonster
Typing Style: onlY capitalizeS thE lasT letteR oF woRdS aS welL aS alL R'S iN woRdS
Emoticons: . : ) , ; ) . : P (three eyes)
Background: Karaka Shaman is a member of the highest and most secret caste in all Troll society; black bloods. Black Blooded trolls are the ones who truly rule Troll society, serving in the shadows, and using magick and influence to control Alternia secretly. Unlike other Trolls, Black Blooded Trolls produce sexually with each other in order to keep the circle small. Karaka is the daughter of the High Priest and Priestess of the Cult of Black Blood who worship and control an ancient god called Legraleth.
Karaka' blood color also allows them to have different eye and horn colors but also gives them a natural ability to expertly craft spells and potions with ease. Personality-wise, Karaka is cool and laid back and well liked. They wish they could be like the Trolls of the lower classes and often enjoys dressing up in common clothes and pretending to be one of them.  They are exeptionally good at writing and drawing and enjoys watching anime such as The One Where The Boy With The Eyepatch Promises Their Soul To The Demon Entity In Exchange For That Entity's Servitude Until Such Time That The Boy With The Eyepatch Gains Revenge On Their Enemies And These Are The Agreed Upon Terms And Also They Might Be Gay Together Because The Boy And The Demon Are Very Close Emotionally And Often Get Close Enough Physically To Kiss (the original subtitled version). Them Lusus is the ancient god Legralth who has three eyes and 400 tentacles and whose mouth could eat the entire universe, and they call them Leggy as a cute nickname.
Them weapons are of Knifekind and they wield a knife long enough to be a sword but not quite sword-y enough to actually be a sword. They like to decorate that sword with little skulls and hearts. They also enjoy collecting and burning candles as well as writing and drawing fanfiction, often pairing together their favorite fictional characters and sometimes even people they know IRL.  They are very close to them Father, the High Priest, who sometimes lets them dictate the agenda of the planet for fun. This is where their screen name comes from.

I used to spend a lot more time on the intros to my articles. Back when I first started writing about fantasy sports, I'd spend as much time thinking about a sharp or funny opening as I would analyzing the reasons behind Giancarlo Stanton's struggles to hit the inside fastball in the early part of the 2016 season (Note: they turned it around). It just felt natural to write some sort of parable about my personal life or just some random silly thoughts in general to ease us all into the analysis.
But over the last year, I've been less able to do that. Most of it is simply a lack of time these days, but some of it is that the articles I'm currently writing don't lend themselves to easy introductions. I mean, trade values? I could talk about the time I chased my college calculus teacher through the gym to argue for a higher grade, but I don't think that really works, do you?
There's a story I tell people who occasionally tease me about being a fantasy sports analyst. Fantasy sports are awesome, and they're a wonderful distraction from our day-to-day lives. But, and I say this without hyperbole, fantasy football saved me once. I wrote about it once before, and no, it doesn't fit in well with a trade values article. But, frankly, I haven't written a long-winded opening in awhile, so you guys are stuck with it. Or, you know, just scroll down to the trade values part of it. Our relationship will be irrevocably broken, so, consider that!

Several years ago in December, my family and I learned that my father didn't have much longer to live. It was a pretty big shock to both my and my family's systems. My father was a truly wonderful guy – smart, funny, strong. So, we all had to figure out how to cope. Oh right, and I was also expecting my first child any minute. Stressful times, they were.
I remember also worrying about how to tell my friends. If you've read my articles or participated in one of my AMAs on Reddit, you know I joke around quite a bit, so it was going to be a tough conversation. One night, I was sitting in my car, and I called my buddy Fitz. I told them what was happening, and they were completely shocked and didn't know what to say.
We sat on the phone for a few minutes, just kind of not saying much. And finally, I said, “Man, my fantasy team is gonna be hard to beat in the playoffs, though, right?” There was silence for a few seconds, and then we both burst out laughing.
For the next couple of weeks, Fitz and I had a lot of conversations about fantasy football. Often times, we'd remark how absurd it was that we were talking about fantasy given my situation. But then we'd just laugh at the absurdity of it.
I remember going to the funeral parlor with my mother after my father died, making the arrangements, and then coming home and watching Michael Vick score about 30 points in the last quarter of a game against the Giants to win me my semifinal match (against Fitz, no less). I remember calling Fitz while grocery shopping for my mom, wondering if I should start Joe Webb as a wide receiver, even though they were playing QB for the Vikings (thanks to a glitch in Yahoo!'s position eligibility).
Fantasy football is how I was able to make it through my dad passing away. It's how I made it through the first few weeks after my daughter was born. And when our family dog died suddenly right at the start of this year's football season, fantasy sports (and Fitz) provided the distraction.
It's a silly game we play. But that doesn't take away how important it can become in many of our lives or how a late Marcus Mariota touchdown pass to Taywan Taylor that wins you a matchup can lead to you screaming so loud that it wakes up your kids and puts your marriage in jeopardy (Note: picked up some flowers on the way home today – marriage saved). So don't be embarrassed by the significance that fantasy sports has in your life. But trust me, have a local florist you can trust or a box of chocolates hidden away just in case!
And with that, let's jump into this week's trade values. Enjoy!
Analyze any potential deal with our Trade Analyzer >>
Quarterbacks
So, let's talk about the elephant in the room which, in addition to the ridiculously oversized stuffed animal in my daughter's closet, is also the Aaron Rodgers injury. Rodgers will likely miss the rest of the season with a broken collarbone, which is just bad for football, man. But as for trade values, it has the minimal effect of moving many quarterbacks up a tick in value, mainly because there is simply one fewer elite option, making the remaining ones worth slightly more.
Other than that, the main movers are because of injuries. Marcus Mariota was clearly limited on Monday, as they rarely left the pocket and refused to scramble even when they had a lane. But they suffered no setbacks and word is that they should be fully recovered after their bye week in Week 8. So, they return closer to pre-injury value. As for Jameis Winston, it sounds like they avoided major injury, but it's still unclear as to whether they will start this week. Winston hasn't yet shown themselves to be special for fantasy purposes this year, so it's hard to value them as anything more than a borderline QB1 at this stage.
Running Backs
My goodness. Well, I think we can officially say that there is no way to appropriately measure Ezekiel Elliott‘s value. All we know is that they will now play this week and it seems, barring some unforeseen rescheduling of a court date, next week, too. After that, it's anybody's guess. If I was trading for them today, I'd personally value them as a mid-range RB2. There are question marks surrounding just about everyone in that range, and it seems just as likely that Elliott will give you production for the rest of the season as it is that they will give you only another game or two. But, I think we can all agree, if you trade for Elliott, you have nerves of steel. So, pat yourself on the back.
As for that Adrian Peterson trade, well, everyone came out a winner. Both Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara (to a lesser extent) rise in value, as it's clear they'll both benefit from not having to cede uninspiring touches to Peterson. As for ol' AP himself, they had quite the debut for Arizona. They spike in value, but you've surely seen their best effort of the season. Buy them as a low-end RB2 going forward, however.
DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry move ever so closer in value, as the situation is moving dramatically toward a true time-share. Yes, that obviously takes away from Murray's value, but I wouldn't get all that worried yet. Murray now has four catches in each of their last two games, and they should be able to make up much of the value from their lost carries through the air. As for Henry, he's quickly reached borderline RB2 status, and should have some staying power.
Mike Gillislee fumbled. That was a bad choice. Gillislee saw carries after that fumble, but ceded significant work to Dion Lewis, who has taken on a bigger role in recent weeks. I can't say for certain which running back I'd rather have more going forward, but neither one makes a particularly exciting option at this stage.
Wide Receivers
Every Green Bay wide receiver takes an unfortunate dip in value with the downgrade from Rodgers to Brett Hundley (Note: I actually think Hundley will be quite good for fantasy, but we can discuss that another time). Randall Cobb was due for a value correction anyway, and so takes a more significant drop, but Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams have to move down somewhat as well.
It's impossible to deny Michael Crabtree‘s value as one of the top wide receivers in all fantasy football at this point. Yes, I do believe that Amari Cooper has been Space Jam'd, and there are aliens out there that have come to our planet and stolen their football ability to win an important cartoon football game. But, be that as it may, Crabtree flourished last year with Derek Carr, and he's even more impressive this year. They deserve to be valued as such.
A few former afterthoughts move into the fringe WR3 range. John Brown looks closer and closer to full strength, as they played roughly 75 percent of the snaps last week and caught their second touchdown in as many games. Nelson Agholor‘s performance has always seemed fluky to me, but he's averaging 53.5 yards per game and has the second-most receiving yards in the NFL out of the slot (behind only Golden Tate). And Marvin Jones should become even more relevant with Tate's injury. Jones had already begun seeing an uptick in targets, and that trend should continue going forward.
Tight Ends
Zach Ertz nudges ahead of Travis Kelce in value because, well, Zach Ertz is awesome. He's currently on pace for a 91-catch, 1,080-yard, 11-touchdown season. If you took the best numbers from each of their previous four seasons, you'd have a 78-catch, 853-yard, four-touchdown season. A true superstar at the position.
Evan Engram, Cameron Brate, and Austin Seferian-Jenkins all move into the reliable TE1 category, no matter how much the NFL may want to prevent Seferian-Jenkins from scoring touchdowns. All three of these guys see consistent targets and are threats to score touchdowns in every game.
Until next week, friends!

Today is May Day. Since 2007, I have advocated using this date as an international Victims of Communism Day. I outlined the rationale for this idea (which I did not originate) in my very first post on the subject:
May Day began as a holiday for socialists and labor union activists, not just communists. But over time, the date was taken over by the Soviet Union and other communist regimes and used as a propaganda tool to prop up their regimes. I suggest that we instead use it as a day to commemorate those regimes' millions of victims. The authoritative Black Book of Communism estimates the total at 80 to 100 million dead, greater than that caused by all other twentieth century tyrannies combined. We appropriately have a Holocaust Memorial Day. It is equally appropriate to commemorate the victims of the twentieth century's other great totalitarian tyranny. And May Day is the most fitting day to do so…. The main alternative to May 1 is November 7, the anniversary of the communist coup in Russia. However, choosing that date might be interpreted as focusing exclusively on the Soviet Union, while ignoring the equally horrendous communist mass murders in China, Cambodia, and elsewhere. So May 1 is the best choice.
Our relative neglect of communist crimes carries a real cost. Victims of Communism Day can serve the dual purpose of appropriately commemorating the millions of victims, and diminishing the likelihood that such atrocities will recur. Just as Holocaust Memorial Day and other similar events have helped sensitize us to the dangers of racism, anti-Semitism, and radical nationalism, so Victims of Communism Day can increase awareness of the dangers of extreme government control of the economy and civil society.
In this 2012 post, I explained why May 1 is a better date for Victims of Communism Day than the available alternatives, such as November 7 (the anniversary of the Bolshevik coup that led to the establishment of the first communist state) and August 23 (the anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet Pact). However, as I emphasized in last year's May Day post, I am more than willing to adopt a different date if it turns out to be easier to build a consensus around it than around May 1.
This year's Victims of Communism post gains added relevance due to recent events in Russia and Ukraine. The ideology of Vladimir Putin's regime is authoritarian nationalism, not communism, and its misdeeds are orders of magnitude smaller than those of the Soviet Union. The threat it poses to the West is likewise far smaller than that of its predecessor. Nevertheless, it is significant that Russia's current ruler is a former KGB colonel, and a longtime apologist for communism who has called the fall of the Soviet Union “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the twentieth century. If a former Gestapo or SS colonel became chancellor of Germany and began repressing opposition media, persecuting gays and lesbians, annexing territories that Germany lost in World War II, and calling the fall of the Third Reich the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century, there would be a great outcry even if the ex-Gestapo chancellor did not engage in mass murder and repression on the scale of the Nazis and was generally more cautious and less aggressive than Hitler.
Be that as it may, there are many good reasons to increase awareness of the crimes of communism, most of which go far beyond current events. Victims of Communism Day could help achieve that goal.
UPDATE: In this 2012 post, I addressed the objection that May Day should not be used for Victims of Communism Day because it would be wrong to take it away from trade unionists and non-communist socialists.

On January 11, 2017, the Washington Wizards were 19-19 and posed no threat in the upcoming Eastern Conference playoffs. A core of John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter Jr., Markieff Morris and Marcin Gortat is not exactly a starting lineup that keeps LeBron James awake at night.
After the game last Monday against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Wizards have the NBA talking about a potential matchup in the playoffs with Cleveland. The Wizards are hot! They're winning games and have played themselves in the middle of the Eastern Conference standings with a 31-21 record.
#2 John Wall (Courtesy of SB Nation)
How have the Wizards gotten so hot?
Let's start out with the eccentric all-star leader, John Wall. The former number one pick in the 2010 draft has averaged 23 points and 10.5 assists which would both be a career high if this trend continues.
Wall has turned a young and talented team into a dangerous unit that can dominate every aspect of the game. They have given the Wizards the leader the team needed and they have the experience to take Washington on a playoff run that could ultimately lead them in for a series against LeBron James and the Cavs.
Home Court Advantage
Going into the Cleveland matchup on Monday night, Washington had a 17-game home win streak. While the Cavs won the game, there is no doubt in any fan's mind that the Wizards put up a fight and fell a little short due to what will be considered, shot of the year.
Before the shot heard around the league, Washington was rolling at home; taking down opponents like Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Boston. When the playoffs roll around, the Wizards will be hard to beat at home. In a big market city like Washington D.C., winning in the playoffs is hard to come by. Don't be surprised if there are big fan turnouts come April and May.

Money Ball
Bradley Beal signed a massive contract this summer which included $128 million over five years. Otto Porter Jr. is a Restricted Free Agent this summer coming off their rookie contract and John Wall is proving that they are worth more than the five-year, $80 million contract extension they signed in 2013.
It makes sense that players will perform better than they usually do when a payday is on the way, and that is the case with the Wizards. Beal's contract appeared to be a very questionable move by Washington going into the season, but a campaign without injuries is exactly what Beal needed as they are having a career year. Beal has been proving all of their critics wrong as many were appalled by the huge contract Beal received in the offseason. Otto Porter was the third overall pick in a very weak draft. While Porter hasn't been as disappointing as Anthony Bennett or Alex Len, they haven't lived up to their expectations they had at Georgetown.
“Don't be surprised if you see a seven game series between [Cleveland and Washington] in the Eastern Conference Finals.”
What to Expect for the Rest of the Season
The Wizards have struggled against the top teams in the NBA (Cleveland, San Antonio, Houston, Toronto) with a 0-7 record against these teams and still have four pivotal matchups against Boston, Toronto and Atlanta left to determine the playoff seeding.
Other than that, the Wizards have been tested by the western conference and have a fairly easy schedule to close out the season besides the two matchups with Golden State.
If Washington can stay healthy, they will be a lock to host in the first round of the playoffs. Washington has proven they can beat most teams (especially teams in the Eastern Conference) and that is what will send them far in the playoffs.
This year won't be an early exit for the Wizards, they are playing good basketball and are only 2.5 games behind the Celtics for the two seed. If you liked what you saw in the Monday night matchup against Cleveland, don't be surprised if you see a seven game series between the two teams in the Eastern Conference Finals.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Provisions shoehorned into the Republican health care bill dangle extra money for Alaska and Wisconsin, home states of one GOP senator whose vote party leaders desperately need and another who co-sponsored the legislation, according to analysts who've studied the legislation.
The 140-page measure, which top Republicans hope to push through the Senate next week, is stuffed with language making some states winners and others losers. Aides say the legislation is still changing as leaders hunt the 50 GOP “yes” votes they'll need to turn this summer's jarring Senate rejection of the party's crusade to erase President Barack Obama's law into an eleventh-hour triumph.
Alaska is home to GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who's among a handful of Republicans who've not said how they'll vote. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is one of the bill's co-sponsors and their support is not in question, but the episode suggests the value of helping craft of legislation.
The bill was chiefly written by GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham. It would end Obama's Medicaid expansion and subsidies for people buying private insurance and combine the money into new block grants for states.
With all Democrats opposed, Republicans controlling the Senate 52-48 can lose only two votes if they are to succeed, leaving the bill's fate uncertain. Generally, it would shift money from states that expanded their Medicaid programs for the poor under Obama's statute, which tend to be run by Democrats, to the largely Republican-run states that shunned that expansion.
The measure would shield Alaska from some cuts it imposes on Medicaid, according to analysts, including from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, by limiting spending to a maximum amount per beneficiary starting in 2020. The federal-state program for low earners has always automatically provided whatever money is needed for eligible recipients. Montana would also qualify for the exemption.
It would also increase federal Medicaid funds for states with high American Indian populations, including Alaska, according to health care consultant April Grady.
Analysts offered no figures about how much money the provisions would mean for Alaska.
The provisions hardly ensure support from Murkowski, who's said she's studying how the measure would affect their state. The administration was pushing for their support, with Vice President Mike Pence calling into an Anchorage talk-radio show Thursday and urging listeners to contact Murkowski and ask them to “stand with President Trump” and support the bill.
According to studies released this week by Kaiser and the consulting firm Avalere Health, Alaska is among many states that would lose money overall under the bill. Alaska has unusually high health care costs because of the remoteness of many communities.
The provisions do not mention Alaska or Wisconsin by name.
But the bill allows a state that turned down extra federal funds to expand Medicaid under Obama's statute to count the rejected money in determining how large its block grant will be, analysts say.
Grady, Avalere analyst Chris Sloan and others said they were unaware of states other than Wisconsin that would benefit from the provision. This language could mean “potentially hundreds of millions” of extra dollars for Wisconsin, said Grady.
In a written statement provided by aides, Johnson said funding formulas to correct “the grossly unfair” distribution of money under Obama's law needed to be changed “to reflect the unique circumstances of many states, including recognizing the innovative reforms of Wisconsin.”
Wisconsin is among 19 states that declined to fully expand Medicaid under Obama's law, which also provided generous federal reimbursements. Under Gov. Scott Walker, a GOP 2016 presidential contender, Wisconsin just partially expanded Medicaid and agreed to accept smaller federal subsidies.
The provision in the health care bill applies to states that expanded Medicaid only up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level and had that expansion in effect this past Sept. 1.
Since the bill's details emerged, health industry and other groups have been lining up against it.
The National Association of Medicaid Directors, representing state officials who administer Medicaid, said it is concerned the measure would have damaging consequences on state budgets. Also announcing opposition recently was America's Health Insurance Plans, a huge health insurers' trade group, the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association.

Associated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed.
I just received this letter from a friend in the banking industry. They prefer to remain anonymous (you'll see why soon enough).
Dear Mark,
There's been a lot of ballyhoo recently about your IPO and your choice of investment bankers. Indeed, a war was fought by the banks to win your “deal of the decade.” As reported in the press, the competition was so intense banks slashed their fees in order to win your business. Facebook is “only” paying a 1% “commission” for its IPO rather than the 3% typically charged by the banks.
Congratulations, Mr. Zuckerberg! On the surface it appears your pals in investment banking have given you a quite a deal!… Or have they?
Let's take a closer look and see what you're getting for your money.
To start, your bankers have the task of selling 388 million Facebook shares to the public. In return, these banks will receive $150 million for their efforts. Morgan Stanley will get the largest share of that amount—approximately $45 million. But is $45 million all that Morgan Stanley makes off your deal?
Before we answer this question, let's first dissect the sales pitch that Morgan Stanley probably gave you to justify “only” the $150 million fee. We'll look at what they told you, and then what that actually means.
1) We will raise the optimal amount of money for the company, for our 1% fee. (Translation: How great is it that Zuckerberg believes they got a great deal by getting us down to a 1% fee! We can't believe they got hoodwinked into agreeing to any level of what are actually variable commission fees.)
2) The definition of a successful deal is having a good price “pop” on the first day of trading. This will make all parties happy and you, Mark, look like a rock star. (Translation: No one benefits more than us if Facebook's share price rises significantly on day one. That first day price “pop” will take money directly out of your pocket and puts it in ours and those of our “best friends”—not yours or the public stockholders. We will, at almost all costs, make this happen.)
3) This is a very complicated process, especially for such a large company, but we are here to successfully guide you through it. (Translation: It actually takes the same amount of work to do a large IPO as a small one. Thus for approximately the same amount of work we're doing for Facebook, we sometimes get only $10 million—$140 million less than we're making on Zuckerberg's IPO.)
4) We will perform due diligence on your company to make sure the business and its finances are as they seem. (Translation: While it certainly does take some time and effort to perform reasonable due diligence, Facebook is a very large and well-known company, and we have done this same procedure hundreds of times.)
5) We will write a prospectus that outlines Facebook's strategy, business plan, financials, and risks, and we will get it approved by the SEC. (Translation: Per the regulatory guidelines, a prospectus is largely a boilerplate document; for the most part, it's just a lot of cutting and pasting.)
6) Once this prospectus is completed and with input from the Facebook team, we will come up with “the range” or the approximate price we think your IPO shares should be sold at to the fund managers. (Translation: The price of your IPO will be determined by where and how we can best optimize our (secret) profits on the deal.)
7) We believe the best shareholders are large fund managers, as they will become long-term holders of Facebook stock. However, at your request, we will allocate 25% of the IPO shares to sell to individual investors. (Translation: There are 835 million Facebook users worldwide. One could argue that what is best for Facebook would be to let all of Facebook's legally eligible customers enter orders to buy Facebook stock. Then through the broker of their choosing, they could enter the quantity of shares they want to buy and the price they want to pay, just like the fund managers do—or are supposed to do. More on this scenario below.)
8) Our 10-day sales process will begin. For this important “road show,” you will be introduced to our large fund manager clients. These fund managers will receive our pitch for why they should buy your stock, and we will assess their interest and at what price. (Translation: Far from being long-term holders, many of our large fund manager “best friends” will, as soon as Facebook shares start trading, sell (or “flip”) for a windfall profit on all the underpriced shares we've given them. We'll enable this by creating a perceived “feeding frenzy” for the stock by putting out an artificially low initial estimate ($28 to $35 per share) for where we think the IPO will be priced. We will then raise that estimate during the road show. Rumors about this begin to circulate over the next day or so.)
9) At the end of the road show on the night before the IPO, we will review the overall supply and demand for the stock and then “price” the shares. This is the price at which the large fund managers will receive their “winning” Facebook shares. (Translation: The price of the stock is already known. For the past few years, Facebook shares have been actively trading on such venues as SecondMarket and SharePost.)
10) And finally, we will put a mechanism, called a Greenshoe, in place that “supports” your share price after the IPO. (Translation: Thank God Zuckerberg doesn't understand one of the greatest investment banking profit enhancing creations of all time—“The Greenshoe.” The Greenshoe will likely be our most profitable part of this deal. It's a secret windfall, and although we market it to Facebook as a method to stabilize its share price, it's really just another way for us, with little effort, to make huge amounts of money.)
We're not done yet, Mark. Now, I'd like to dig a bit deeper into what's going to happen and show you all the additional ways your banker friends and their large fund manager clients are going to make oodles of money off your deal.
1) Morgan Stanley only gives Facebook shares (“golden tickets”) to their best client “friends.” In other words, it's no coincidence that Morgan Stanley's biggest fund manager clients get the bulk of the shares offered in this kind of deal.
2) How do you become best friends with Morgan Stanley? There are lots of ways, such as trading tens of millions of shares with them or using the firm as your prime broker.
3) I'm sure there are a lot of conversations going on right now between Morgan Stanley's salespeople and their clients. These conversations are probably along the lines of (wink-wink) “before we allocate our Facebook shares, we'd like to ask first if you plan to do more trading with us over the next week to six months….”
4) Let's assume that 50 of Morgan Stanley's “best friends” trade an extra 2 million shares so they can get access to more shares of the Facebook IPO. Let's also assume that the average commission these clients pay to Morgan Stanley is 2 cents per share. Well, those extra trades will dump an additional $2 million dollars into Morgan's coffers.
5) Now comes the part where Morgan Stanley actually gives free money to its friends. If the Facebook IPO is like the majority of other recent Internet offerings, here's what Morgan Stanley will likely do. They know Facebook will be a “hot” deal. Especially, with all of the “5% orders” coming in, there will be huge demand for Facebook shares. My prediction is that Morgan Stanley will “price” Facebook at approximately $40 per share. This is the price at which Morgan Stanley's “best friends will be able to buy the bulk of the 388 million shares offered.
6) Now let's now assume that Facebook shares open for trading at $50—a lower percentage premium than Groupon's opening share-price “pop.”
7) Let's assume that one of Morgan Stanley's “best friends” decides to sell 3 million shares right after the opening at $50 per share. That “best friend” will instantaneously make a $30 million profit. That's right, a $30 million profit.
8) Here's a question for you Mark. If Morgan Stanley's “best friends” are selling Facebook shares at $50, who's buying them? The answer is your “friends,” individual investors, most of whom are your customers.
9) Now for the final insult—the Greenshoe. Technically speaking, the Greenshoe gives your investment banks a 30-day option to purchase up to 15% more stock from Facebook than was registered and sold in the IPO. In layperson's terms, this means that, over the next 30 days, your “best friends” at the investment banks are able to buy approximately 50 million of your shares at $40 per share.
10) As in our example above, let's say Facebook shares do trade at $50 soon after the IPO. Now I am a simple person, but if I were given the opportunity to buy something at $40 that I could immediately sell at $50, I would do it all day, every day…. And so will the investment banks. The Greenshoe actually gives these banks the ability to do this for 50 million of your shares.
11) So let's assume that Morgan Stanley and its other banking “friends” buy 50 million shares at $40 per share and then sell these shares at $50. Morgan Stanley and its banking “friends” will make an additional $500 million- yes, $500 million- a HALF BILLION DOLLARS off your company.
So let's now do a tally to see how much money all of your banking friends are going to make just for the privilege of doing your IPO. Let's also see where this money comes from.
“Discounted” fees/commission: $150 million
Greenshoe profits: about $500 million
Extra trading commissions from large fund managers: approximately $10 million
—————
Investment Bank Profits: $660 million
As the lead bank on your deal, Morgan Stanley is likely to get 30% of the overall take. This means that your closest investment banking “friend” will make a bit more than $200 million from your IPO.
Morgan Stanley and the rest of the investment banks involved will also make sure that their favorite fund manager client “friends” are given lots of free money. Assuming that these “friends” are given 75% of the total number of IPO shares, or a total of 291 million shares, and assuming that the stock does rise from $40 to $50, then these fund managers will collectively, in one day, make $2.9 billion dollars in realized or unrealized profits. That's right, 2.9 BILLION DOLLARS.
Mark, by now you must be asking yourself the obvious question. “Where and out of whose pocket does this money come from?”
Well, just think of it this way… Let's assume you own a very expensive piece of waterfront real estate, and you hire a broker to sell it for you. After exploring the market and after getting indications of interest, your broker advises you that $10 million would be a great price for your home. You meet with the potential buyers and decide to sell it for $10 million. After the $1 million commission you have to pay your broker, your net proceeds are $9 million. An hour later, you drive by the house and see your broker in the driveway shaking hands with some different people. You pull over to see what's going on, and you find that the people you just sold the house to for $10 million are very close friends of your broker. To your dismay, you also find out that those friends just sold your (former) house to somebody else for $15 million.
The same exact game is going on here, Mark. You'll be selling 388 million shares of Facebook stock in your IPO. A likely scenario is that your broker “friends” are telling you to sell your shares at $40 per share. You'll take their advice and sell at $40 per share, and the buyers will be Morgan Stanley's biggest fund management clients. By the time you drive around the block, these folks will have sold their shares at $50 per share. In other words, using the same real estate scenario, you'll have sold something of yours for $15 billion that is really worth $19 billion. And for that “unique” privilege, you'll be paying your “friends” at the banks $150 million as a fee.
Makes you wonder who your real friends are…

End of letter

I find the points that my (real life) friend makes here highly disturbing, but I suspect that they also fit with what we now know about dishonesty.
First, although there are many ethically questionable practices occurring here, it's not clear that anything illegal is going on. Second, I think that while this banking industry's IPO process is artfully designed in such a way that, although overall it's good for the bankers and less so for the companies, no single individual believes he/she is doing anything wrong. Third, I also suspect that since this is such a common practice, the bankers most likely truly believe that mechanisms such as getting a first-day IPO “pop” is great for Facebook and that the Greenshoe is fact put in place to stabilize the Facebook stock price, and not simply to generate more windfall profits for themselves. Forth, they probably believe in their own definition of a “successful” IPO, which in their terms is one where the stock is priced at $40 and quickly trades up to $50. In the case of Facebook, this process simply redistributes $4 billion from Facebook to the banks and the large fund managers. For Zuckerberg and their team, I have to wonder whether the emotional value of a first day share price “pop” is worth $4 billion.
I am not sure about you, but I find all of this very depressing.
Irrationally yours,
Dan
Making the Most of Medium Format: Make your own Rangefinder for Zone Focus Cameras 34
When I ordered a new Belair X6-12 I was worried that the shallower depth of field on the 90mm lens would lead to lots of out of focus shot and waste my precious 120 film. Not any more, with this amazingly simple rangefinder that can be customized for any zone focus camera.
Medium format photography is great. You get huge negatives with an amazing level of detail. The release of the new Lomography Belair X6-12 immediately had me drooling over its expansive 6×12 format but medium format can also have its drawbacks. With the longer focal length lenses you tend to get on medium format cameras you get a shallower depth of field. This can be used creatively but with a zone focus camera you can end up with lots of out of focus shots.
Shallow depth of field from medium format film
Before we dive in to this tipster it might be useful to have a quick recap. A rangefinder is a device which allows you to accurately measure the distance between yourself and a fixed object. They have been used for many years in photography to allow accurate focus on cameras which don't let you see the actual projected image. This includes all of Lomography's cameras which are either fixed focus or zone focus.
Fixed focus lenses are designed to work at their hyper-focal distance, the distance at which the maximum amount of the scene in front of you is in focus. Fixed focus lenses are often helped by being: A) fairly wide angle to increase the depth of field; B) having a smaller aperture, again to increase depth of field; C) often having the closest focus distance of around 1m away. With this type of camera, focusing is taken care of for you and as long as you don't try to get too close, everything will be in focus.
Zone focus cameras require you to actually focus them to achieve sharp results. Some of us are better at this than others but I've found that I often end up with slightly out of focus shots. With the 90mm lens on the new Belair X6-12, the depth of field at f8 can be as little as 15cm. This is great for portraits with bokeh filled backgrounds, but not so great if you don't focus correctly and leave your friend looking like a mushy blur.
To overcome this problem, this nifty rangefinder uses your eyes and outstretched arms to triangulate the distance to an object. It isn't as accurate as a proper rangefinder but it will get you very close indeed and take a lot of the guess work out of focusing.
To make the rangefinder you will need the following:
A tape measure
A friend to help you
A computer with a printer and PDF software
software Paper or card to print on
Colouring pens to make your rangefinder easier to read
Step 1
Measure the distance from your left eye to a piece of paper in your outstretched left arm. This may be easier if you have a friend help.
Step 2
Measure the distance between the centre of youR two eyes (you will really need a friend to help here). Try to be as accurate as possible with this measurement. A small error hear will multiply up to be a much bigger error in distance to the object.
Step 3
Simply plug these numbers in two this amazing website and hey presto! It takes care of all the math for you. You will need to include the focus markings on the lens which for instance might be 1m, 2m, 3m and infinity. You can also include extra focus points not included on the lens to allow extra accuracy in focus. More on this in a minute.
Step 4
Print the card following the instructions on the website. You need to print at 100% magnification to ensure the card matches your measurements. I am lucky enough to have access to a plastic card printer so I used that to make one that fits nicely in my wallet.
Step 5
Colour the card in with permanent marker pens to make it easy to spot the change in distances.
Using the rangefinder
To use the rangefinder hold the card at arm's length in your left hand and look through your left eye. Line up the left edge with the object you want to measure, then close your left eye and look through your right eye. The object should have shifted relative to the card. Look where it is now along the scale of the card and this will be the distance to your object. It can be useful to flick back a forwards a couple of times to make sure you aren't moving your arm.
The hanging ornaments are 2m away
If you really are right in the middle of two markings, it is probably safer to go with the distance on the nearer marking, firstly the scale is not linear and halfway between two markings on the card is not halfway in distance to the object. Also lenses give greater depth of field behind the point of focus than in front so you've a better chance of getting it in focus if you go for the closer marker.
The website above also gives the option to include a hyper-focal chart on the card which is great if you don't want to worry about focusing your camera. Unfortunately for any new Belair owners the formats supported only go up to 6×9 so if you are using it at 6×12 you are out of luck.
As a bonus tipster, I mentioned previously that you could include extra lens markings to improve the accuracy of your focus. The instructions for this are below:
Step 1
Start by measuring on the card, the distance from the closest focus the camera can be set to (for instance 1m), to the infinity marker. In this case it is 4.7cm. Note, don't measure all the way from the left edge!
Step 2
Using a tape measure, work out the total distance that the lens has to move to go from 1m to infinity. In this example it is 2.7cm.
Step 3
Dividing 2.7/4.7 gives us a figure of 0.57. This is the factor by which we multiply to work out the new lens markings.
Step 4
If I wanted to add a new lens marking for 1.5m I would measure the distance from the 1m mark on the card, to the 1.5m mark on the card; this is 1.5cm. Then I would multiply this by 0.57 giving 0.86cm. For the purpose of practicality I'm going to round this up to 0.9cm
Step 5
Using a tape measure, measure 0.9 cm from the 1m mark on the lens and make a new mark for 1.5m. Repeat for other intermediate markings. On my Diana I now know that 1.5m lines up with the first head of the small group of people on the 2-4m mark.
It is both easier and more important to do this for close focus distance rather than far distances as the difference between lens markings is larger at close distances and depth of field is shallower.
I hope you find these tips useful!

PBS on #ExxonKnew November 11, 2015
Description:
Oil giant Exxon Mobil was recently subpoenaed by New York's attorney general in an investigation of whether the company has intentionally downplayed the risks of climate change. Judy Woodruff hears from Eric Schneiderman, attorney general of New York, and Kenneth Cohen, vice president of Public & Government Affairs for the Exxon Mobil Corporation.
Cohen's play is to pretend that Exxon, in it's wisdom, has always taken climate change seriously, and is only interested in trying to head off ineffective policy responses to this very real problem.
Cohen's statement that investigators have taken Exxon scientists statements “out of context” suggests they suffer from an irony deficiency.
So how will they separate themselves from the climate denying individuals and organizations they have funded? Cohen says outfits like the American Enterprise Institute, and ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council) will have to speak for themselves, – as if they were out there free-forming and making things up with Exxon's money for 30 years.
Ken Cohen in Exxon Mobil Perspectives:
here's just one problem with that statement: Claiming we stopped our research and suppressed the results is the central point to ICN's exhausting series about ExxonMobil's supposed perfidy. It's the central point that has been repeated in other stories and op-eds, notably from high-profile activists Bill McKibben and Naomi Oreskes. Ms. Banjeera and their colleagues first claimed that Exxon stopped its research in its very first report on September 16, when they wrote (emphasis mine): Toward the end of the 1980s, Exxon curtailed its carbon dioxide research. In the decades that followed, Exxon worked instead at the forefront of climate denial. Ms. Banjeera and their colleagues wrote that Exxon suppressed the results of our climate work in the “About This Series” section on the ICN website (again, emphasis mine): The story spans four decades, and is based on primary sources including internal company files dating back to the late 1970s, interviews with former company employees, and other evidence, much of which is being published here for the first time. It describes how Exxon conducted cutting-edge climate research decades ago and then, without revealing all that it had learned, worked at the forefront of climate denial, manufacturing doubt about the scientific consensus that its own scientists had confirmed. One way to view Ms. Banjeera's recent statement is that InsideClimate News now admits that ExxonMobil did not halt or suppress our research. I hope ICN will add an editorial update to its series reflecting that admission, though I won't hold my breath waiting for it. I noted recently that InsideClimate News tends to make assertions while hoping nobody checks to see if they are correct. That's been their strategy in selectively quoting from our documents – they have counted on people not reading the entirety of those documents, which undercut their accusations

Arguably the greatest ever Champions League Finals, this really was a game of two halves.
The first half was all Milan's, and they got off to a flying start their captain Paolo Maldini opened the scoring inside the first minute. The half only got worse for LIverpool as Hernan Crespo scored 2 more before 45 minutes were up.
At half-time the score was 3-0 and Milan had all but won the greatest prize in football. Rafael Benitez, the Liverpool manager, would have to come up with something special.
They decided to change something. They brought on a Dietmar Hamann, a midfielder, for Steve Finnan, a defender, and changed the formation to a more attacking 3-5-2 as they would have to go all out or they had no chance of pulling back 3 goals against one of the best defences ever.
What happened next was one of the most incredible few moments in any match ever.
In the space of 7 crazy second-half minutes Liverpool scored 3 goals; first, captain Steven Gerrard headed in. Just minutes later, Vladimir Smicer reduced the deficit to 1. 3 minutes after that,Gerrard was fouled in the box and LIverpool were awarded a penalty, with the chance to complete the best comeback ever.
Xabi Alonso, Gerrard's midfield partner, stepped up to take it: Saved! But they squeezed in the rebound. 3-3!

Celebrated scientists and development thinkers today warn that civilisation is faced with a perfect storm of ecological and social problems driven by overpopulation, overconsumption and environmentally malign technologies.
In the face of an "absolutely unprecedented emergency", say the 18 past winners of the Blue Planet prize – the unofficial Nobel for the environment – society has "no choice but to take dramatic action to avert a collapse of civilisation. Either we will change our ways and build an entirely new kind of global society, or they will be changed for us".
The stark assessment of the current global outlook by the group, who include Sir Bob Watson, the government's chief scientific adviser on environmental issues, US climate scientist James Hansen, Prof José Goldemberg, Brazil's secretary of environment during the Rio Earth summit in 1992, and Stanford University Prof Paul Ehrlich, is published today on the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the UN environment programme (Unep). The paper, which was commissioned by Unep, will feed into the Rio +20 earth summit conference in June.
Apart from dire warnings about biodiversity loss and climate change, the group challenges governments to think differently about economic "progress".
"The rapidly deteriorating biophysical situation is more than bad enough, but it is barely recognised by a global society infected by the irrational belief that physical economies can grow forever and disregarding the facts that the rich in developed and developing countries get richer and the poor are left behind.
"The perpetual growth myth ... promotes the impossible idea that indiscriminate economic growth is the cure for all the world's problems, while it is actually the disease that is at the root cause of our unsustainable global practices", they say.
The group warns against over-reliance on markets but instead urges politicians to listen and learn from how poor communities all over the world see the problems of energy, water, food and livelihoods as interdependent and integrated as part of a living ecosystem.
"The long-term answer is not a centralised system but a demystified and decentralised system where the management, control and ownership of the technology lie in the hands of the communities themselves and not dependent on paper-qualified professionals from outside the villages," they say.
"Community-based groups in the poorer most inaccessible rural areas around the world have demonstrated the power of grassroot action to change policy at regional and national levels... There is an urgency now to bring them into mainstream thinking, convey the belief all is not lost, and the planet can still be saved."
The answer to addressing the critical issues of poverty and climate change is not primarily technical but social, say the group. "The problems of corruption, wastage of funds, poor technology choices and absent transparency or accountability are social problems for which they are innovative solutions are emerging from the grassroots."
To transition to a more sustainable future will require simultaneously redesigning the economic system, a technological revolution, and, above all, behavioural change.
"Delay is dangerous and would be a profound mistake. The ratchet effect and technological lock-in increase the risks of dangerous climate change: delay could make stabilisation of concentrations at acceptable levels very difficult. If we act strongly and science is wrong, then we will still have new technologies, greater efficiency and more forests. If fail to act and the science is right, then humanity is in deep trouble and it will be very difficult to extricate ourselves.
The paper urges governments to:
• Replace GDP as a measure of wealth with metrics for natural, built, human and social capital – and how they intersect.
• Eliminate subsidies in sectors such as energy, transport and agriculture that create environmental and social costs, which currently go unpaid.
• Tackle overconsumption in the rich world, and address population pressure by empowering women, improving education and making contraception accessible to all.
• Transform decision-making processes to empower marginalised groups, and integrate economic, social and environmental policies instead of having them compete.
• Conserve and value biodiversity and ecosystem services, and create markets for them that can form the basis of green economies.
• Invest in knowledge through research and training.
"The current system is broken," said Watson. "It is driving humanity to a future that is 3-5C warmer than our species has ever known, and is eliminating the ecology that we depend on for our health, wealth and senses of self."

До конца конкурса Google Lunar Xprize, стартовавшего 10 лет назад, осталось 4 месяца и продлений больше не будет. Пока что ни у одного из пяти финалистов нет уверенной даты старта. Две команды в срочном порядке ищут деньги на завершение и запуск своих изделий.Google Lunar X Prize — премия в $30 млн., учережденная фондом X Prize и Google в 2007 году. Главный приз в $20 млн. получит команда, первой совершившая мягкую посадку на Луну, проехавшая минимум 500 метров и передавшая на землю фотографии и видео в высоком разрешении.В начале 2017 были объвлены 5 финалистов конкурса:В августе 2017 дату конца конкурса окончательно передвинули на 31 Марта 2018 года. Были добавлены и новые промежуточные цели — $1.75 млн. за выход на орбиту Луны и $3 млн. за доказанную мягкую посадку на Луну. Moon Express первая частная компания в мире, получившая разрешение от правительства США на посадку на Луне. Moon Express получила $20 млн. долларов в январе 2017, которых должно хватить на доработки и на запуск. Планы у компании грандиозные и победа в конкурсе не единственная цель. Планируется доставка лунного грунта на землю, добыча полезных ископаемых и колонизация Луны! Но вернемся к конкурсу. Moon Express заказала сразу 3 запуска на ракете Electron фирме Rocket Lab's на конец 2017 года. Но после не совсем удачного старта Electron этим летом, Moon Express перенесла свои пуски на 2018 год. Следующий тестовый старт Electron назначен на 08.12.2017.У команды есть только посадочный модуль, а передвигаться по Луне он будет перелетами.Израильская команда SpaceIL еще в 2015 году первая подписала контракт на доставку посадочного модуля на Луну. Запускать свой посадочный модуль она собралась дополнительным грузом на Falcon 9.В отличии от Moon Express, SpaceIL организация не коммерческая, создана в образовательных и научных целях. В случае победы призовой фонд планируется пожертвовать на техническое образование в израильских школах. SpaceIL уже удалось собрать $55 млн, но денег не хватает и 29 ноября директор SpaceIL выступил с призывом о помощи: «Мы находмися на решающей стадии проекта. Сборка посадочного модуля закончится через две недели. Но если нам не удастся собрать недостающие $20 млн. в ближайшее время, семилетний труд израильских ученых пропадет!»Как и в Moon Express, в SpaceIL не разрабатывали ровер и преодолевать расстояние в 500м будут перелетами.Японская команда Hakuto завершила разработку своего маленького лунохода, весящего всего 4 кг., и не нуждаетса в дополнительных средствах. Спонсорами Hakuto выступают 20 японских фирм, а разработку ведет ispace inc., которая собирается добывать на Луне полезные ископаемые. Запуск планируется в марте 2018 года на индийской ракете Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle(PSLV) вместе с индийской же командой Team Indus. После неудачного старта в августе 2017 сроки запусков ракет PSLV передвинулись. Усугубляют ситуацию и планы индийского космического агенсва ISRO, запустить свой собственный луноход Chandrayaan-2, в аппреле 2018.Сама Team Indus остро нуждается в средствах не только на запуск, но и на доведение проекта до стадии готовности. Индийской команде не хватает $35 млн., что является половиной от общей стоимости проекта. В недавнем интервью представители организации даже заговорили о сборе средств через crowdfunding.Team Indus разрабатывает не только ровер, но и собственный посадочный модуль.Самым загадочным финалистом является интернациональная команда Synergy Moon , вобравшая в себя участников конкурса: STELLAR, Independence-X, Omega Envoy и SpaceMETA. Запускать собираются ровер Tesla Surveyor на ракете Neptune N-8 LUNA, специально разрабатываемой организацией Interorbital Systems Corporation. Сама ракета еще не готова. По поводу финансирования и дат запуска информации нет.Немецкая команда Part time scientist опоздала с подписанием контракта на запуск в конце 2016, но от плана полетов на Луну не отказывается. Part time scientist хотят развернуть на Луне LTE связь с помощью Vodafone. А создаваемый вместе с Audi ровер отправят к месту посадки Apollo 17. В 2018 проект перейдет в завершающую фазу, а запуск планируется на 2019.Американская Astrobotic тоже не отказывается от своих планов доставлять коммерческие грузы на Луну. В 2014 году команда выиграла все промежуточные призы XPrize на общую сумму $1.7 млн. и долгое время казалась лидером конкурса. Еще в 2011 году Astrobotic вела переговоры с SpaseX о первом полете на Луну. В дальнейшем команда заключaла многочисленные договоры о партнерстве с разными фирмами(например DHL) и агенствами(включая NASA и немецкой DLR), но первый полет постоянно переносила. В 2017 году первый полет перенесли на 2019 а лететь планируют уже на Atlas V от ULA.Успех команд во многом зависит от стартов ракет, на которых они собираются добраться до Луны, и частично от финансирования. Успеют ли команды за 4 месяца осуществить посадку — покажет время. Важно что конкурс уже выполнил свою цель и продвинул частную космонавтику ближе к Луне.
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - After a decades-long campaign to legalize marijuana hit a high mark in 2012 with victories in Washington state and Colorado, its energized and deep-pocketed backers are mapping out a strategy for the next round of ballot-box battles.

The passage of the ballot measures in Colorado and Washington state in November 2012 allowed personal possession of the drug for people 21 and older. That same age group will be allowed to buy the drug at special marijuana stores under rules set to be finalized next year in 2013. REUTERS/Anthony Bolante/Files
They have their sights set on ballot measures in 2014 or 2016 in states such as California and Oregon, which were among the first in the country to allow marijuana for medical use. Although those states more recently rejected broader legalization, drug-law reform groups remain undeterred.
“Legalization is more or less repeating the history of medical marijuana,” said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. “If you want to know which states are most likely to legalize marijuana, then look at the states that were the first to legalize medical marijuana.”
The passage of the ballot measures in Colorado and Washington state in November allowed personal possession of the drug for people 21 and older. That same age group will be allowed to buy the drug at special marijuana stores under rules set to be finalized next year.
No other states have legalized marijuana, America's most widely used illicit drug, for recreational use. The drug remains illegal under federal law. Connecticut and Massachusetts also approved medical marijuana in 2012.
The efforts in Washington and Colorado demonstrated significant funding might.
The Drug Policy Alliance spent more than $1.6 million as one of the main funders of the Washington state campaign. Peter Lewis, chairperson of insurance company Progressive Corp, gave $2.5 million to the Washington campaign, and travel guide author Rick Steves chipped in another $350,000, according to records.
Ahead of the Colorado vote, the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, which has been active in campaigns around the country, gave about $1 million to the effort, state records show.
A big question mark hangs over whether the pro-legalization momentum could be slowed if the federal government takes an aggressive stance against the new laws.
The U.S. Department of Justice has been mostly silent on the issue. President Barack Obama said in a TV interview this month it did not make sense for the federal government to “focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that, under state law, that's legal.”
CHANGING TIDE?
In 1996, California became the first state to allow medical marijuana by a popular vote, and Oregon and Washington state were part of a second wave in 1998. But Oregon rejected a marijuana legalization ballot measure in November, while California voters did the same in 1972 and 2010.
The 2010 ballot measure in California failed to sway voters because it would have left regulation to a hodgepodge of local governments, instead of a uniform set of state rules, said Dale Gieringer, director of the California branch of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
This month, California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom became one of America's top state officials to call for reform of marijuana laws when they told the New York Times that laws against the drug “just don't make sense anymore.”
Activists say they see demographic changes as giving them an advantage.
“We know that the younger generation is more supportive and the opposition really comes from the older generation. And as time goes on there's more of the younger generation and less of the older generation,” Gieringer said.
“The second factor is we have these results in Colorado and Washington under our belt, so that sort of fertilizes the ground,” they added.
One key point marijuana advocates are thrashing out is whether to pursue any ballot initiative in 2014, or wait until the presidential election of 2016, when the turnout of their reliable base of youth voters will likely be higher.
Regardless of when a ballot initiative might come to California, the nation's most populous state, groups opposing legalization vow to defeat it.
One of those is the California Police Chiefs Association.

“I have yet to hear a legalization proponent talk about how society will be enhanced, how the real social problems facing our country will be improved by legalizing yet another substance that compromises people's five senses,” said John Lovell, government relations manager for the group.
A number of addiction specialists say that where marijuana is legalized, teenagers will come to believe the drug is harmless and more will use it.
Medical marijuana is already big business in California. The state Board of Equalization in its most recent analysis from 2009 estimated medical cannabis dispensaries ring up sales of $1.3 billion a year and pay sales taxes of $105 million.
Kelvin Benjamin will miss their second straight game with a knee injury.
Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott said Friday the receiver would miss Sunday's tilt versus the New England Patriots.
The news doesn't come as a surprise after Benjamin missed practice all week. The big-bodied receiver was injured on the first drive of the team's Week 11 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. He's played less than five quarters since being traded from Carolina to Buffalo.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Benjamin has a shot to return next week.
Tyrod Taylor will try to keep pace with Tom Brady on Sunday without Benjamin, left tackle Cordy Glenn (foot, ankle) and backup running back Mike Tolbert (hamstring). Running back LeSean McCoy is dealing with knee soreness and will not practice Friday, McDermott said. However, he's expected to be good to go for Sunday, McDermott said.
Here are other injuries we're tracking on Friday:
1. Dallas Cowboys defensive back Orlando Scandrick suffered two transverse process fractures in their back and likely will miss one or more games, a source told Rapoport. Scandrick was kicked on the third play of the game Thursday against the Washington Redskins, leading to the injury. They played through it and received their diagnosis Friday.
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said they expect Sean Lee (hamstring) to play Week 14 against the New York Giants. Lee has missed the last three games. Jones also confirmed that the X-ray taken on Dak Prescott's right hand during Thursday's win over the Washington Redskins was negative.
2. Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy said Aaron Rodgers could practice Saturday for the first time since being placed on injured reserve because of a broken collarbone. "We're looking tomorrow to potentially practice them in a trial return. We'll determine that tomorrow," McCarthy told reporters. Rodgers has been on IR since suffering the injury in Week 6 against the Minnesota Vikings.  They are eligible to return off IR in Week 15.
Running back Ty Montgomery was placed in IR and is scheduled to undergo season-ending wrist surgery, Rapoport reported. Cornerback Kevin King (shoulder) will not play against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
3. Bruce Arians said running back Adrian Peterson (neck) is a game-time decision for the Arizona Cardinals. However, Arians downplayed the severity of the injury this week.
4. Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown did not practice Friday and Saturday because of a toe injury. Rapoport says the injury is minor and Brown should be fine for Monday night against the Cincinnati Bengals. Brown is listed as questionable. Cornerback Joe Haden (leg), linebackers Ryan Shazier (ankle) and James Harrison (knee), tight end Vance McDonald (ankle) and safety Michael Mitchell (ankle) also didn't practice.
5. New York Jets running back Matt Forte (knee) and guard Brian Winters (ankle) are questionable for Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Cornerback Juston Burris (concussion) won't play.
6. Atlanta Falcons cornerback Desmond Trufant (concussion) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Minnesota Vikings. Cornerback Brian Poole has been downgraded to questionable with a back injury.
7. Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen (foot) and running back Christian McCaffrey (shoulder) are both questionable for Sunday's game.
8. Miami Dolphins running back Damien Williams (shoulder) will not play against the Denver Broncos.
9. Chicago Bears linebacker Isaiah Irving (knee) has been ruled out for Sunday. Safety Adrian Amos (hamstring) also did not practice Friday and is listed as doubtful. Safeties Deon Bush (ankle) and DeAndre Houston-Carson (ankle) and cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc (illness) have been ruled questionable. Right guard Josh Sitton (concussion) and cornerback Bryce Callahan (knee) were limited in practice Friday and are questionable against the 49ers.
10. Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Beau Allen (knee), defensive end (groin), receiver Alshon Jeffrey (foot), center Jason Kelce (ankle) and cornerback Patrick Robinson (knee) all were full participants in practice Friday.
11. Houston Texans coach Bill O'Brien does not expect wide receiver Will Fuller (ribs) to play on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.
12. Andy Reid says Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Dee Ford (back), defensive back Eric Murray (ankle) and running back Charcandrick West (not injury related) won't play on Sunday against the New York Jets.
13. Minnesota Vikings tackle Mike Remmers (back) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Atlanta Falcons. Remmers was a limited participant in practice Wednesday and sat out Thursday and Friday. Linebacker Eric Kendricks (hip) is listed as questionable but Mike Zimmer said "he thinks" he'll play.
14. Baltimore Ravens guard Jermaine Eluemunor (shoulder) has been ruled out against the Detroit Lions. Running back Alex Collins (calf), linebacker C.J. Mosley (ankle), cornerback Jimmy Smith (Achilles) and tackle Ronnie Stanley (knee) are all listed as questionable for Sunday.
15. Detroit Lions running back Ameer Abdullah (neck) and guard T.J. Lang (foot) are both questionable for Sunday against the Ravens. Cornerback Jamal Agnew (knee) and center Travis Swanson (knee) are both out.
16. Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Mike Williams (knee) will not play Sunday versus the Cleveland Browns. Casey Hayward (calf/personal), Corey Liuget (toe) and kicker Nick Novak (back) are all listed as questionable.
17. Oakland Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper (ankle) will not play Sunday against the New York Giants. Cornerback David Amerson (foot), guard Gabe Jackson (ankle) and receiver Cordarrelle Patterson (hip) are all listed as questionable.
18. New York Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas (neck/wrist) will not play Sunday. Defensive tackle Damon Harrison (elbow) is listed as questionable. Offensive lineman Justin Pugh (back) is doubtful to play.
19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston (shoulder) is set to play Sunday against the Packers, but he's officially listed as questionable for the game.
20. New Orleans Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore (ankle) and offensive tackle Terron Armstead (thigh, shoulder) are each questionable for Sunday vs. the Panthers. Tight end Coby Fleener (concussion) and safety Marcus Williams (groin) have been ruled out.
21. Seattle Seahawks safety Earl Thomas (heel) is officially questionable for Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles, but coach Pete Carroll said they are fine and good to go. Linebacker D.J. Alexander (shoulder), offensive tackle Duane Brown (ankle), tight end Jimmy Graham (ankle) and linebacker Bobby Wagner (hamstring) also are questionable.
Running back Mike Davis, tight end Luke Willson and cornerback Shaquill Griffin are off the injury report and will play Sunday.
Dion Jordan (neck) is doubtful for the Seahawks. Carroll said there is nothing that can be done to elevate that. Carroll said they think it will take another week. â James Palmer (@JamesPalmerTV) December 1, 2017
22. New England Patriots wide receiver Chris Hogan (shoulder) and offensive tackle Marcus Cannon (ankle) will not play against the Buffalo Bills. Defensive end Trey Flowers (rib), cornerback Eric Rowe (groin) and offensive tackle LeAdrian Waddle are questionable. Tom Brady is off the injury report after dealing with an Achilles tendon issue over the last two weeks.
23. Indianapolis Colts cornerback Donte Moncrief (groin) is questionable for Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Center Ryan Kelly (concussion) will not play.
24. Denver Broncos guard Ronald Leary (back), quarterback Paxton Lynch (ankle), defensive tackle Domata Peko (knee) and defensive end Derek Wolfe (neck) will not play Sunday. Linebacker Shane Ray (wrist, illness) is questionable.
As has become a tradition for Valiant over the last couple of years, the publisher's Free Comic Book Day offering closes with teasers for new books launching later in 2015. This year's comic teased returns for Archer & Armstrong , Eternal Warrior , and Harbinger ; it looks as though Valiant is bringing it all back harder than an S Club 7 reunion tour.
Kano
First up are Archer & Armstrong , in a teaser image by Kano , the artist for the recent miniseries The Delinquents , which also starred the pair. Valiant doesn't offer a date for when the buddy superhero comedy will return, or a creative team, but Kano seems a likely choice for artist.
Meanwhile, artist Cary Nord provides the teaser for a November return for The Eternal Warrior , who has clearly been one of Valiant's favorite characters since the line relaunch in 2012. The character is joined here by the new Geomancer, a young girl from the future called Tama, introduced at the end of The Valiant.
Harbinger is the final new series teased in the issue, with an image that appears to be the work of Trevor Hairsine . Once more, there's nothing to indicate when the characters will return, or which creative team will handle it --- but at least we know Zephyr (everybody's favorite) will be back soon.
There's no sign of the much-anticipated second Doctor Mirage miniseries from Jen Van Meter and Roberto De La Torre , nor any sign of Shadowman , who would seem to be a lock for a new series, given he's one of Valiant's best-known characters, but that doesn't mean those series aren't in the works. They may just be a little further off.
Sadly there's also no ongoing series for Ales Kot and Adam Gorham's '80s tech cyborg Beta Max, although perhaps that one is best left in our collective dreams.
The 'Bad Boys of Brexit' who led the campaign to break Britain away from the European Union have taken on a new exit challenge: splitting California into two states.
Former UKip leader Nigel Farage and Leave backer Arron Banks have just returned from the United States, where they helped raise $1million (£800,000) for a 'Calexit' campaign, which would split California into two eastern and western regions.
There are several 'Calexit' campaigns competing for a referendum in the United States, with one aiming to remove the state from America entirely as a response to President Donald Trump being elected last year.
Farage and Banks, who led the 'Leave.EU' campaign, appear to be pitting the eastern, more rural side of California against the western 'coastal elite' liberals in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Farage and Banks, who led the 'Leave.EU' campaign, appear to be pitting the eastern, more rural side of California against the western 'coastal elite' liberals in Los Angeles and San Francisco in their campaign to split California into two parts
If broken apart, the eastern part of California would more likely vote Republican, giving the party two more senators and electoral college votes for a 2020 presidential election.
The Western side of the state would likely continue to vote Democrat in elections.
Farage and Banks' goal is to hold a referendum during the US midterm elections in 2018, according to The Sunday Times.
Banks said of the campaign: 'It would be portrayed as the Hollywood elites versus the people, breaking up the bad government. Seventy-eight per cent of people in California are unhappy with their government. It's the world's sixth largest economy and it's very badly run.'
Banks said they and Farage wanted to show people in California 'how to light a fire and win' the Calexit referendum.
The pair were recruited for the campaign by polling expert Gerry Gunster and Republican Scott Baugh, a former member of the state assembly.
Banks, Farage and their spokesperson Andy Wigmore were in California two weeks ago to receive an award for their Brexit campaign from the American Association of Political Consultants.
While in the state, Farage attended several events in Orange County, where Baugh is based, and about $1million was raised for the 'Calexit' campaign.
Banks, Farage and their spokesperson Andy Wigmore were in California two weeks ago to receive an award for their Brexit campaign from the American Association of Political Consultants
Wigmore said that those who raised money - agriculture tycoons and tech entrepreneurs - have felt 'left out since [Former President Ronald] Reagan'.
'This has been done before with West Virginia and Virginia and North and South Dakota, so it can work,' they said.
Banks added: 'We were saying that people said the same about Brexit — and we just went and did it. The money was pledged to take it to the next level. This could be the greatest political showdown ever.'
Gunster has helped win 30 state referendums in America and predicted the EU vote within .01 per cent.
In California, 365,800 people have to sign a petition for a proposition to appear on a ballot.
With a population of nearly 40 million, California is one of the most diverse states in America, with whites outnumbered by Hispanics and members of other ethnic groups,
In 2015, it also had the sixth largest economy in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund -- ahead of France and India.
In November's election, the state broke nearly two-to-one in favor of Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.
Another Calexit campaign emerging, called Yes California, would see the state seceding from America entirely.
Should that initiative make it on the ballot, a 'Yes' vote would repeal clauses in the California Constitution 'stating California is an inseparable part of the United States and that the United States Constitution is the supreme law of the land,' a statement from California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla's office said.
Farage, the former UKip leader, was the first British politician to meet President Donald Trump after their election win
Voters would then need to decide in another referendum in 2019 whether California should become a separate country.
Yes California campaigners are pushing for independence on grounds the state is out of step with the rest of the US and could flourish on its own.
'In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,' according to their website.
Farage, the former UKip leader, was the first British politician to meet Trump after their election win.
They and the other 'Bad Boys of Brexit' held a boozy Washington DC party ahead of now-President Donald Trump's inauguration in January
Farage toasted the billionaire tycoon in front of a rowdy crowd during a speech ahead of the presidential win.
In a speech to the packed room they said: 'Brexit was great but Trump becoming president is Brexit plus, plus, plus. They were right when they said it was a movement - but a movement can't exist, or flourish, without a leader. And Trump is the only man I've ever met in my life who has made me feel like an introvert.
'He is a larger than life personality. When they were given the rule book for how you run for president they tore up the book and threw it out of the window.
In February, Farage posted a picture of them having 'dinner with The Donald' at a Trump Hotel on Twitter
'And I guess, when I look back in the years to come, perhaps the greatest joy of 2016 was that realisation, as state after state in the mid-West went red, just to see the faces of those democrats.
'I've spent most my life in politics being regarded, I suppose, as the patron saint of lost causes.
'Through most of my life, what happens in America in terms of social trends or developments, we follow four or five years later. America is the leader.
'Now I would like to think in my own little way that what we did with Brexit was the beginning of what is going to turn out to be a global revolution and that Trump's victory is a part of that.'
Farage said: 'We've had Brexit and perhaps that contributed just a little bit to things changing in the USA and who's to say that bandwagon won't continue to roll in 2017 across much of Europe.'
In February, Farage posted a picture of them having 'dinner with The Donald' on Twitter.
Finding common ground with some of Trump's criticism of the political establishment, Farage met the president in November and has offered their services as Britain's ambassador to the United States - something that has been rejected by Prime Minister Theresa May's government.
Entitled 'Dinner with The Donald', Farage posted a picture of themselves smiling at a camera, with Trump and four other people around a table in a photo which gave the location as the Trump International Hotel.
Initially it was just an unconfirmed report circulating in the German FAS media that the local FinMin had proposed a "temporary Grexit" option. Then it got some more traction when a ZDF journalist reported that it was much more than just speculation...
Schäuble´s idea of a "Temporary Grexit" not yet discussed at Eurogroup meeting. But paper exists and circulates. #Greece — Stefan Leifert (@StefanLeifert) July 11, 2015
It now appears that this was not only not a rumor, but Schauble's sentiment is contagious: moments ago Finnish broadcaster MTV reported that first Finland, and then the Eurozone's smaller, if somewhat more solvent nations, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and even the Netherlands, support the German position on temporarily suspending Greece' Euro membership.

German government sources: Idea of a temporary Grexit was agreed on by Merkel and vice-chancellor Gabriel. #Greece https://t.co/Psz8oLe2xL — Stefan Leifert (@StefanLeifert) July 11, 2015
Finnish Kauppalehti confirms that the Finns party leader Timo Soini just said no to more Greek bailouts:
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini According to the Finnish Government does not allow for supporting the Greek. "The starting point is of course the fact that Finland's responsibilities do not grow. It is a government program entry," Foreign Minister Timo Soini commented on a possible third rescue package for Greece to Ilta-Sanomat.
In which case one can forget Grexit: at this point of total diplomatic failure, one should be worried how long before all the other insolvent, if actively pretending to be doing ok, PIIGS have before the wrath of "Northern Europe" turns their way. As for Greece, it now appears just a matter of time.
Microsoft, along with a slew of other major tech companies who opposed Trump's immigration ban, donated lots of cash and free services to the president on inauguration day, according to new Politico report. After donating a reported $250,000 in cash, and the same amount in technical services, to the Trump's inauguration parties on December 28, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella condemned the ban in an Q&A with employees. They said, “There is no place for bias or bigotry in any society, in any context. That's where we start from. We will always as a company stand for that diversity and inclusion.”
The question inevitably arises—is it possible for a company to stand for “diversity and inclusion” and donate money to a guy who is making good on their racist campaign promises? Of course not.

Unsurprisingly, other tech companies also donated lots of goodies to Trump's inauguration festivities, but the details on that are a little less clear. Like Microsoft, Politico reports that Amazon and Google donated both cash and tech services to Trump's big boy party, but the exact amounts are unknown. According to a Bloomberg report, Google is coordinating the funding of the legal brief that 127 tech companies—including Microsoft and Facebook—filed legal documents against Trump's executive order. Amazon, on other hand, filed motions in federal court on behalf of 49 of its employees who are citizens of the Muslim-majority countries Trump has banned.
Facebook didn't donate any cash to Trump, but confirmed to Politico that it made “an ‘in-kind' donation by providing Instagram photo booths and a mini Oval Office it had set up for party-goers.”
Tech companies that gave money to Trump after December 31 have yet to disclose their donations, since the inaugural committee has 90 days to report on its fundraising, so it remains how many companies that oppose ban gave money to the man responsible for it.

It should come as no surprise that the tech warriors tried to win the president's favor as Trump—a man who campaigned on banning Muslim immigrants—entered into office.
As Trump begins to enact more of their racist and sexist campaign promises, will the tech warriors continue to kiss the ring? (Yes.)

Republican Senator Mark Kirk was a Teabully favorite when they were elected to in 2010.? But then, in January 2102, Senator Kirk suffered a serious stroke which caused them to have to learn to walk and talk all over again. It took a year?for the Senator to return to their work in the Senate.
Perhaps the stroke caused the Senator to reflect upon the world and life in general, as Senator Kirk has broken with the Republican Party on many social issues since returning to the Senate.? We have reported on their support for the ENDA Bill, which recently passed in the Senate. ? And Republican Speaker of the House has pledged that the ENDA Bill will never be considered by the House, as it is an unneeded piece of legislation that would only lead to frivolous lawsuits.
The World Congress of Families,?(WCF) based in Rockford, Illinois, has been actively engaged in Russia and in Ukraine??promoting hate legislation. ?LiberalAmerica.org has previously reported?on these kinds of efforts.? The group had reserved a Senate meeting room for a November 15, 2013 symposium. But, following objections raised by LGBT activist groups,?the reservation was canceled. ? A spokesperson for Senator Kirk's office said Thursday that:
Senator Kirk doesn't affiliate with groups that discriminate.
And Larry Jacobs, the managing director of the WCF, said in an email responding to the cancellation, that:
Obviously Senator Kirk doesn't care about families and children and freedom and has chosen to side with the policies of decline, death, and disease promoted by the Sexual Radicals.
Fortunately for this hate group masquerading as just another group of good concerned Christians, Speaker John Boehner has stepped in for Mark Kirk to find a spot for the group to meet in the Capitol. Speaker Boehner does not see the assistance that they are giving to the WCF as tacit endorsement of their views.? Boehner said that:
One of the duties of the speaker's office is scheduling rooms throughout the Capitol complex, and we routinely provide a forum for discussion of public policy issues from across the political spectrum, including for liberal causes.
Perhaps Speaker Boehner also believes that their duties do not include putting legislation that is wildly popular with the American people onto the floor of the House for a vote.
Three Teabully candidates have already announced that they will be challenging Speaker Boehner in the upcoming Republican Primary for the 8th District Congressional seat in Ohio. By denying a House vote on ENDA, and through this action, is Boehner hoping to stave off the challengers and show their social conservative bonafides?
Senator Mark Kirk has courageously been taking the right positions on social issues since their one year absence from work.? They should be applauded for those efforts, even if they are resulting in no new legislation being presented to the President for signature.? But, Senator Kirk's efforts are also making them more likely to lose their seat to a Democrat, in 2016.
Remember one term Teabully Congressional wonder, proud deadbeat dad, Joe Walsh, who lost their seat in the District of Illinois to Democrat, war hero, and disabled vet, Tammy Duckworth in 2012?? Walsh has recently been questioning Senator Kirk's physical ability to remain in the Senate, saying:
It is expected that Walsh will challenge Congresswoman Duckworth and try to retake the House seat in 2014.? But if they lose, which the smart money says they will, is Walsh then going to try to challenge Senator Kirk in the 2016 Republican primary?
Now Senator Mark Kirk is a sympathetic and courageous individual who gets high praise for their conduct since returning to the Senate following their stroke.? And they should live long and prosper in all of their future endeavors.? But, a Democrat will certainly be opposing Senator Kirk on November 8, 2016.
And will there be a new Senator from Illinois taking a seat in the United States Senate in January, 2017 by the name of Michelle Obama?
LibreOffice 5.2 is out, and one of the key improvements to Impress and Draw has been the introduction of the Properties Panels to the sidebar - namely Slide Content Panel for Impress, and Page Content Panel for Draw.
These panels enable quick access to the slide/page size and background properties. Both these panels have the same underlying code and features, and only differ in labels depending on the Application Context. So this post aims at explaining all these features in the panel available to both Impress and Draw.
The entire enhancement report can be found here. The main credits for developing the panel go to bubli (Katarina Behrens), Rishabh Kumar, and jay (Yousuf Philips). I have been making enhancements to the same after the panel got published.
Features
Format dropdown to easily change Slide/Page format.
Quick option to change Orientation of the Slide/Page
Dropdown to change background of the slide/page. Currently 5 settings - None (no background), Color (Solid Fill), Gradient, Hatching, and Bitmap Color Setting Gradient Setting - Make a gradient with two colors, which gives added customization compared to presets Hatching Setting Bitmap Setting
Insert Image as Bitmap - With option (pop-up) to set the image as background for all pages/slides
Checkbox to toggle the display of the master slide's background.
Checkbox to toggle display objects.
GNOME 3.12
This post doesn't cover all the distributions, just let's say the most famous ones, and only their official repositories. Of course whatever applies for parent distros it more or less applies for their derivatives as well.
Additionally I'm not following the news of every distro out there, so feel free to correct me ;)
Arch
Arch is one of the most popular choices for Gnome-Users, and they (Arch) traditionally include the latest GNOME releases inside the first 2 weeks. Archers are going to be the first to get 3.12 in an official way. Anyway, nothing much to say about Arch :)
The only issue with Arch is that they don't ship GNOME-Software App, due to libalpm “incompatibility” with the latest PackageKit. ALPM (Arch Linux Package Management) is the backend of Pacman (the upgrade tool of Arch).
Gentoo
Another rolling release distro like Arch, mostly used in large and critical deployments, famous for its scale-ability, performance and customization. GNOME 3.10 arrived in Gentoo just within the last couple of weeks, and GNOME 3.12 is expected to come in the next few weeks but not in stable.
However you can tweak your ebuilds and use the GNOME Overlay where GNOME development takes place. Currently you will find GNOME 3.11.92 -and possibly 3.12 in a few days.
Fedora 20
Fedora 21 is expected to be released somewhere at the end of 2014 with GNOME 3.14. They still have a decision to make, shipping GNOME 3.12 as a regular update in Fedora 20, or using the Copr repository. A decision that can take a month or so.. Fedora never was good in deadlines, while they usually include GNOME around 1+ month after the GNOME initial release. Pretty bad.
For now you can use GNOME 3.12 on Fedora 20 from Copr building system with your own risk. There is no support for Copr, you cannot file bugs (there are bugs!), and you should have a good knowledge how to downgrade in case things go wrong.
It is a worth to mention that Fedora.Next (aka 21) is going to be the closest thing in what we like to call “GNOME OS”.
Ubuntu-GNOME 14.04
Ubuntu GNOME officially ships GNOME 3.10, and that means no 3.12 there.
With your own risk you can use the highly unstable GNOME3 Staging PPA, that includes GNOME 3.12. Not all modules have been updated to 3.12, but Ubuntu GNOME hasn't been released yet.
Final release is scheduled for April 17, including Ubuntu and all Ubuntu official spins.
openSUSE 13.1
openSUSE current version 13.1 ships GNOME 3.10. GNOME 3.12 might be available on some unsupported OBS repo at some point, if it's possible to build it against an “old” distro without changing the entire system.
The next openSUSE release (13.2) is scheduled for November 2014 and that means that they might directly include GNOME 3.14 and skip 3.12, pretty much the same as Fedora 21 does.
openSUSE Factory is the repo that openSUSE.Next is branched from, and it currently includes GNOME 3.10.
Mageia 4
Mageia is one of the best GNOME distros you will find around. Mageia 4 currently ships GNOME 3.10, where Mageia Cauldron ships GNOME 3.12.
Cauldron is the Mageia.Next (aka Mageia 5). Mageia 5 is scheduled for December 19.
Mageia's 5 technical specifications haven't yet published but ..with GNOME 3.14 coming in September and Mageia 5 Beta1 coming in September 30, it is possible to get a Mageia 5/GNOME 3.14 release.
Again like the openSUSE case, Mageia can have a 3.12 skip, but maybe an unofficial GNOME 3.12 backport will come.
Debian
The current stable distribution of Debian is version 7, codenamed “wheezy”. It was initially released as version 7.0 on May 4th, 2013 and its latest update, version 7.4, was released on February 8th, 2014. Next Debian version is codenamed “jessie” and a release date is to be announced, but it will take place inside 2015.
I'm apologizing to the friends of Debian but when I see this in the Debian GNOME page..
DebianSqueeze includes GNOME 2.30.
DebianWheezy includes GNOME 3.4.
DebianUnstable includes GNOME 3.8.
..I think there isn't any reason to say anything more. They don't “care” much about GNOME, and Debian isn't much of a desktop distro anyway. Debian is more for the enterprise and less for the home.
However, you can check the GNOME 3.10 Status and GNOME 3.12 Status on Debian, and you can get GNOME 3.10 (but not a 3.12!) there, but not with a officially supported way.
Oh, and by the way Steam OS uses GNOME Shell 3.4. This is totally a GNOME dis-advertisement..
BSDs
Just in short, you can have GNOME 3.12 in BSDs!
FreeBSD http://blogs.gnome.org/desrt/2014/03/26/gnome-3-12-and-freebsd-and-a-virtual-machine/
http://blogs.gnome.org/desrt/2014/03/26/gnome-3-12-and-freebsd-and-a-virtual-machine/ OpenBSD http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports-cvs&m=139591115404328&w=2
It seems that BSDs do better than Linux when we come to GNOME ..Interesting ;)
Note that there isn't any implementation of Systemd (soft GNOME requirement) for BSD systems. You can read an interview (FOSDEM 2013) of the legendary Lennart Poettering about Systemd in BSD.
GNOME 3.12 and Distros..
As you can see the only way to get GNOME 3.12 for now is Arch Linux. In the future I am expecting a better support from Fedora.Next (the closest release dates) and from Ubuntu GNOME. In any case I want to say that Getting GNOME page is totally obsoleted. Just let Arch there.. At least for now..
President Donald Trump's sometimes tone-deaf manner of speaking was on display again when they honored veterans of Pearl Harbor at an Oval Office ceremony Thursday. They referred to the surprise 1941 Japanese attack on the U.S. air base, which killed 2,400 Americans, destroyed nearly 200 aircraft and launched America into World War II, as a “pretty wild scene.”
“That was a pretty wild scene. You'll never forget that, right?” they asked veteran George Blake.
Blake responded: “I've never forgotten.”
Trump also noted that another vet, Robert Fernandez, based on the record of their activities during the attack, “really gave it to 'em pretty good.”
Twitter jumped on Trump's fanboy characterization of the battle, with one tweet sarcastically gushing about it being the “grooviest” since Antietam in the Civil War (in which it's estimated more than 3,600 were killed).
"The grooviest day in America since Antietam." https://t.co/dR3FbiJkLq — John Lingan (@johnlingan) December 7, 2017
“Kate Beckinsale was there. They were in their prime, let me tell you.” https://t.co/JD6q1gOyVx — Asawin Suebsaeng (@swin24) December 7, 2017
Trump signed a presidential proclamation marking Dec. 7 as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. They also took the opportunity to make a political point.
“We are building up the military beyond what you ever thought,” they told one veteran. “It got depleted. You know what happened over the last... quite a long period of time. But not with us. Our budget's now going to be higher than ever before... we're doing a job.”
Check out Trump's speech in the video above.
There's a quote by Tim Berners-Lee, Director of W3C and inventor of the World Wide Web, that says, “The power of the web is in its universality”. As people who make a living by making websites, it's our responsibility to ensure everyone has access to them. Web accessibility seems like a tall order on paper, but it's definitely much easier than it sounds.
Our ten web accessibility guidelines are designed to ensure that all websites are universal.
This will not only help screen reader users, but will also improve browsing experience for slow connections. We've sorted our guidelines by implementation time to give you a clear picture of just how much effort you'll have to put into this process. Before you get overwhelmed, take our word for it—it's totally worth it.
First things first:
What the heck is Web Accessibility?
According to W3C, web accessibility means that every person can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the web. In this regard, website accessibility encompasses all conditions that affect access to the web, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.
You'll find a bunch of content on this topic around the web, and you should really look deeper into the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) if this topic interests you.
With that in mind, here are our guidelines:
1. Do not depend on color (~ 45 minutes)
Color is a powerful tool we often use to express emotions and communicate messages on the web. However, we shouldn't put all our faith in color to convey meaning and information to our users.
Why?
For example, it's widely known that green means “right” and red means “wrong,” but what happens when we use this as our only mean of communication?
If we display important messages in our user interfaces using only color to convey information, we are leaving 4.5% of the population behind.
Color should complement an error or confirmation message, but it cannot be the only tool we use. In order to be certain that we reach all our users, we should always add labels or icons that display whether filled information in a form is right or wrong.
A very interesting solution was adopted bycaniuse.com, which provides an alternative color palette to display the content of their compatibility tables.
It is ideal to check for color blind and contrast while designing, so make sure that you and your design team have the right tools. We highly recommend theStark pluginfor Sketch that helps you design with accessibility in mind!
2. Do not block zoom (~ 5 minutes)
In the age of responsive design we might have made a few irresponsible mistakes.
One of these is the apparition of maximum-scale=1.0, which disables the functionality to zoom in on web pages using mobile devices.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1">
Astigmatism affects between 30 and 60% of adults in Europe and Asia, but blurry vision can affect people of all ages and nationalities (Hi mom!).
The ability to zoom in is not just another whiny WCAG guideline, but a tool to simplify everyday life for these people. So next time you are building a responsive website remember to think of my mom every user with blurry vision.
Besides making it possible for users to zoom freely on mobile devices, remember to also check that your layout looks good at up to 200% zoom in desktop browsers.
3. Rediscover the alt attribute (~ 45 minutes)
No matter how long you've been making websites, you might be surprised to know these few tips on the famous, yet mysterious, alt attribute.
The alt attribute is compulsory to every img tag but an empty alt attribute is completely valid. If an image is decorative or not necessary to understand the content of the page you can simple use alt=”” Screen readers tell the user that an <img> tag is an image so there is no need to be redundant and begin your alt with “Picture of”; just go straight to the point. The function of an image is as important as its meaning: if your logo links to your website's home page then your alt text should be something like ”Home Page” instead of “Logo.” Alternative text is not just about accessibility. Sometimes users with slow data connections disable images to achieve a faster browser experience. Have those users in mind whenever you write your alt attributes too!
But not all images in your website are img tags, right? You might have an SVG or two around there…or a whole SVG icon system.
How do we make SVG accessible for everyone? Luckily for us, the Scalable Vector Graphics standard has us covered! In order to describe our vectors we have the <title> and <desc> tags for short and long descriptions.
<symbol id="langIcon"> <title>Language Icon</title> <desc>Longer description</desc> <path d="M0 2C6.47 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.47 10 9.99 0h24v24H0z" /> </symbol>
4. Add subtitles and captions to your videos (4+ hours)
This might be one of WCAG's most difficult guidelines to achieve, not because of a technical difficulty, but because it can be time consuming. There are a few ways to get this done:
Let's take YouTube for instance. Once you upload a video to the platform you can enable closed-captions. These are automatically generated and might turn out to be inaccurate in some circumstances depending on the language, background noise, or the speaker's accent. Nevertheless, these are very easy to implement and can work well on most English-speaking videos. If we are looking for 100% accurate captions it's hard to trust YouTube to come up with good copy, so we must write the captions ourselves or hire a third party to do so. YouTube will take the most common subtitle formats (.srt, .sub, and .sbv) as well as letting us write the subtitles on the platform itself, which can be very convenient if we don't own any subtitle software or if we wish to ask our community to help us translate the content without giving admin access to our account.
But perhaps you don't want to use YouTube as your hosting platform. Perhaps you wish to use an HTML5 video hosted on your server. We've got you covered! HTML5 includes the <track> tag, which you can use to easily attach as many caption and subtitle files as you like using the WebVTT format (Translations FTW!).
<video controls> <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <track label="English Captions" kind="captions" srclang="eN" src="captions.vtt" default> <track label="Subtitulos en español" kind="captions" srclang="es" src="subs.vtt"> </video>
5. Semantics = accessibility (~ 45 minutes)
Font tag, remember? I hope you don't, those were dark times.
In spite of common belief, semantics weren't born with HTML5. They have been with us since the first HTML page and have greatly improved since then. With the HTML5 standard, new semantic tags are introduced for our everyday use.
Ok, but isn't semantics just for SEO?
Not necessarily. When you consciously choose an <h1> tag over a <p> or a <span>, you are deliberately changing the meaning of an element, providing hierarchy, and building a tree structure of your page's information.
Screen readers are not oblivious to this. In fact, semantics is one of its most useful weapons.
Keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility, so make sure to use the proper semantic tag for each element, from h1 to the brand new main tag.
6. Use the right mark-up (~ 30 minutes)
As a follow up to the previous point I'd like to discuss a few false friends and controversial pairs:
Time vs. Datetime
The time element displays many types of date formats, time zones, and durations using the ISO 8601 standard to represent dates and times.
Datetime is an optional attribute that helps represent the content of . Let's see some examples:
<time>14:54</time> Hours and minutes <time>2018-06</time> Year and month <time>-03:00</time> Time zones <time>2h 32m</time> Harry Potter 2 Duration <p>CSSConf Argentina took place on <time datetime=”2016-08-07”>August 7th</time></p>
Del and Ins
The web changes constantly, but there's no need for those changes to go unnoticed. We can mark edits using the ins and del HTML tags in combination with the datetimeattribute.
The ins element represents an addition to a document:
<ul> <li> <ins datetime="2017-08-02">Icecream</ins> </li> <li>Candy</li> <li>Pasta</li> </ul>
The del element represents deleted content:
<ul> <li><del datetime="2017-06-05">Rewatch Harry Potter 8</del></li> <li><del datetime="2017-06-05">Cry because ____ dies.</del></li> <li><del datetime="2017-06-06">Write article</del></li> <li>Order room</li> </ul>
Button vs. <a> tag
Get the popcorn, this is a good one. When should we use each?
Let's see:
<a> tags are meant to link one file to another or open links in a new tab or in the current one. However, this tag is not ideal whenever we wish to trigger actions such as hamburger menus or image galleries. The button element is the right choice for these situations and is usually achievable with JavaScript.
Also, the button tag can be easily confused with the input type=”button” but the difference relies on in the former being able to take more content (text, image + text or only images).
There are two things to consider when using the button tag:
First, if the content of a button is not explicit enough (take an “X” in a close button for example), we must add an aria-label attribute to help explain the function.
<button aria-label="Close">X</button>
Second, if adding an href attribute makes sense (a search component or a lightbox gallery), then we might as well use an tag and override the link behavior with JavaScript. An image gallery that uses a tag with href will degrade gracefully if JavaScript is not enabled.
But…
7. Use roles when necessary (~ 1 hour)
In order to tell screen reader users that our link triggers an action and it is not, in fact, an ordinary <a> tag, we must add the role attribute with the value “button”.
But beware!
When writing your JavaScript you need to call your functions not only on click but also when the user presses the spacebar. This is necessary because the behavior used for buttons is different from the one used for links and the user should be able to trigger the action on either of these commands.
<a href="img/kitten.jpg" role="button" onclick="handleBtnClick(event)" onKeyPress="handleBtnKeyPress(event)"> Button </a> function handleBtnClick(event) { // Do something } function handleBtnKeyPress(event) { // Check to see if space or enter were pressed if (event.keyCode === 32 || event.keyCode === 13) { // Prevent the default action to stop scrolling when space is pressed event.preventDefault(); // Do something } }
Read more about this on MDN.
Bear in mind that aria roles are not usually necessary unless you break the rules, like in the example above. HTML semantic elements have a default role already applied: “navigation” for the <nav> tag, “link” for the <a> tag, and so on. That means that a role attribute is only necessary when we wish to change these default values.
8. On hiding elements (~ 1 hour)
There are a few methods available to hide things with HTML & CSS. This table will help you find the best alternative for every situation:
If you want to hide elements from view but still let screen readers know about them, then the last option is the best.
This is very useful in form labels or skip-to-content links. The visuallyHidden class is one of those CSS codes that should go into your favorites so it is easy to find for every project. Yes, you can change the name if you like (my suggestion is .pottersCloak, fyi)
.visually-hidden { position: absolute !important; clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE6, IE7 */ clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px); padding:0 !important; border:0 !important; height: 1px !important; width: 1px !important; overflow: hidden; } body:hover .visually-hidden a, body:hover .visually-hidden input, body:hover .visually-hidden button { display: none !important; }
9. Follow web accessibility standards (~ 30 minutes each week)
Web accessibility is hard and standards and guidelines are here to help.
All previous points in this article lead here: how does <button> work? When should we use it? What's the difference between display: none; and the “hidden” attribute?
It might be dull at first but not only are W3C standards and WCAG guidelines reliable, they're also educational. Go ahead and get lost in the infinity of information they provide. I assure you you'll discover code and practices you never knew existed!
10. Audit and review (~ 3 hours)
Once you've applied all this knowledge, it's time to test it. Here's a list of the best tools to audit website accessibility:
ChromeVox: Available for Mac and Windows users, this Chrome extension is a screen reader you can use to test your website.
Accessibility Developer Tools for Chrome: Another great extension for this browser that adds an accessibility audit option in your everyday developer tools.
Color Filter: Test your website for different types of color blindness with this online tool.
W3C Validator: This official W3C tool will let you know if your HTML markup follows the web accessibility rules!
A11Y Compliance Platform: The Bureau of Internet Accessibility (BOIA) offers a graded report that provides an overview of how your website fares when tested against the WCAG A/AA checkpoints.
WAVE: A web accessibility evaluation tool made by WebAIM.
Aerolab's experience with web accessibility
We try to make a habit of testing our work constantly. Our next product should always aim to be better than the last. Yes, we sometimes make mistakes, but we strive to constantly improve and adapt, not to mention to learn something out of each challenge.
We want our products to offer the best possible experience to users, which is why we started including accessibility standards to our workflow little by little.
There's still a long road ahead of us as well as some major room for improvement, but we're darn happy to have chosen this path.
The landing pages we did for Xapo are an example of how we've been applying website accessibility standards, in case you want to check them out:
Final Words
Website accessibility is not always easy to implement, but if you make it part of your everyday workflow (instead of a last-minute checklist) implementation and testing will become easier over time.
When in doubt, don't be afraid of asking other developers or doing some research. Some of my favorite sources of information are The A11y Project, A11y Wins, HTML5 Doctor, and MDN.
So what do they do now?
All was going quite splendidly. Over a period of almost two years, Justin Trudeau's Liberals maintained a tidy lead on the governing Conservatives. Nothing Prime Minister Stephen Harper tried seemed to boost their declining fortunes.
To alter the prevailing mindset, which favoured change, something freakish had to happen.
Story continues below advertisement
What happened was the news story of the year. The deranged gunman's attack on Parliament was a mood-altering event. It elevated national security to a prime place on the issues ladder. Mr. Harper's numbers rose, Mr. Trudeau's receded. The lead has almost disappeared.
Liberals aren't panicking. "The strategy has been to force the other two parties to put out the main platforms first, which they have now done," a top strategist wrote in an e-mail. "We have a big clear target to shoot at with our own."
Are they moving up their policy release dates? "Given that we aren't using the public's money to advertise our platform, as Harper is, that would be ill-advised."
What is encouraging for them is the decline of the New Democrats outside Quebec. A two-horse race between progressives and the Harper right is "the best set of circumstances we could hope for."
Three scenarios are being taken into account, the strategist noted. A spring election, a fall election, a Harper resignation. "Anything less than a majority government is a loss for Harper, which they know."
The momentum shift, fortune's turn toward the Tories, is not disputed. That turn included the Jian Ghomeshi scandal, which suits the CBC-loathing Prime Minister just fine – all the more so because it spun off into sexual-harassment allegations involving the opposition parties, which has tied them in knots.
Behind the headlines, the Liberals are trying to put together a policy playbook that can sell. On the economy, a caucus member said, look for a focus on "infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure." On criminal justice, reported another, reforms will be aimed at repealing the 19th-century fill-the-jails model the Conservatives have put in place. There will be an activist approach on health care to address Canada's plunge in the rankings among countries with universal care systems. According to one study, Canada went from fourth of 11 countries a decade ago to 10th today.

On the military, the Liberals will be exploiting the government's shabby treatment of veterans. On the environment and climate change, they have big openings. On ethics, we can expect a big reform package to underline the Conservatives' sorry record, illustrated by the Senate expenses scandal.
To contrast a Prime Minister who has refused to sit down with the premiers in first ministers' conferences, the Liberals will likely highlight co-operative federalism: Just because meeting with all the premiers can be risky business doesn't mean that you run and hide. Other prime ministers, as they correctly point out, did not display that kind of cowardice.
Playing the waiting game on policy pronouncements may work in Mr. Trudeau's favour because their party will be in a position to respond to the initiatives of the others and occupy flanks not taken. It will also leave Mr. Harper's heavily financed advertising machine with fewer Liberal targets.
The more important consideration, as former PM Jean Chrétien noted in a recent chat, is the mood of the people. The party in sync with the national mood wins, they said.
The key questions now are how much the mood has changed as a result of the trauma of Oct. 22 and how long this change will last. The story of the year favoured the Conservatives because it increased the appetite for a leader who brings stability, not change.
Most, including Mr. Chrétien, seem to believe that its impact won't last much beyond the start of the new year. But there are a lot of ways for the Conservatives to keep the fear card alive. Unforeseen occurrences, such as another terror strike, could work in their favour as well.

This set introduces the following race(s) for the following civilization(s):
In the fall of 1985, four teams of photographers started a project to document the elevated Orange Line and the communities it served before its planned demolition in 1987. The project, conceived by the photographer Linda Swartz, and managed by Urbanarts, Inc. for the MBTA, paired a professional photographer with a student from the photography program at the Hubert H. Humphrey Occupational Resource Center.
During the course of the two year project, the students and their mentors created hundreds of photographs of the elevated, its riders, and their neighborhoods. The result was an historical document of the elevated and the communities it connected as seen and explored by a group of talented photographers from a variety of backgrounds, who approached the project from a variety of aesthetic and conceptual directions. The project achieved both of its major goals: To use photography to focus our attention on the hidden and ignored details of the world that surrounds us and to create a dynamic visual record of a part of Boston that was to change and never be the same.
Photographers who worked on the project: David Akiba, Ziad Aoude, Edgardo Calcano, James Cullers, Lou Jones, John Lueders-Booth, Jeffrey Mooltrey, Melissa Shook, Ricardo Smith, Linda Swartz, Irene Welch, Stacey Woodberry.

The Homeland Security Department has abruptly reversed course and dropped plans to ask a private company to give the government access to a nationwide database of license plate tracking information.
Secretary Jeh Johnson canceled a contract proposal on Wednesday that had been issued last week.
The proposal said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was planning to use the license plate data in pursuit of criminal immigrants and others sought by authorities. The contract notice came amid growing concerns about government surveillance of U.S. citizens but didn't address potential privacy consequences.
Gillian Christensen, an ICE spokesperson, said the contract solicitation was posted "without the awareness of ICE leadership."
"While we continue to support a range of technologies to help meet our law enforcement mission, this solicitation will be reviewed to ensure the path forward appropriately meets our operational needs," Christensen said.
The department said Johnson has ordered a review of the proposal.
Before the notice was canceled, Christensen said the database "could only be accessed in conjunction with ongoing criminal investigations or to locate wanted individuals."
Law enforcement has been using license plate readers for several years, but privacy advocates have raised concerns that the unchecked collection of such information could allow for the tracking of an average citizen's every movement. Lawmakers around the country, meanwhile, have been wrestling with whether or how to control the collection and use of license plate data.
At least 14 states are considering measures that would curb surveillance efforts, including the use of license plate readers.
License plate readers — essentially cameras that snap rapid-fire pictures of license plates and vehicles as they pass — are in use in a host of locations, by private companies and law enforcement. They can be mounted to police cars, traffic lights or toll booths.
But it's not just the license plate number that gets recorded. The readers also record the date, time and location of the vehicle when the picture was taken.
According to the contract proposal, the government wanted "a close-up of the plate and a zoomed out image of the vehicle."
The Homeland Security Department also wanted instant and around-the-clock access to the records and is asking for whoever wins the contract to make the information available through a smartphone app. It is not clear from the contract notice how long individual records would be kept or what other government agencies may have access to the trove of records.
Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney with the San Francisco-based civil liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said those unknowns represented serious privacy concerns.
"The base level concern is that license plate data is location data, and location data is very revealing," Lynch said. "It can tell you a lot about a person's life: where they go, who they associate with, what kind of religion they practice, what doctors they visit."
In 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union criticized the collection of license plate scanner data and warned that millions of records were being collected with little or no safeguards for people's privacy.
Catherine Crump, an ACLU lawyer, said Wednesday they were pleased to hear that the department has canceled the contract proposal but still worried about that it might be brought back to life at some point.
"While we are heartened that it looks as though the plan is off the table for now; it is still unexplained why the proposal was put forward and why it has been withdrawn," Crump said.
The government's contract proposal was published amid revelations of surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency. Privacy advocates have argued that NSA phone data collection programs and other surveillance programs are gobbling up massive amounts of information about U.S. citizens who have no ties to criminals or terrorists, which the government has said the programs are designed to target.

Quentin Capobianco, 18 (right), was accused of beating Jesse Smith, 29, to death with a hammer in Astoria on Jan. 12, 2015. View Full Caption Facebook, LinkedIn, DNAinfo/Trevor Kapp
KEW GARDENS — A Bitcoin trader charged with murder Tuesday beat their roommate to death with a hammer after being tied up and forced to liquidate their stocks, they told police.
Quentin Capobianco, 18, told police that their lawyer roommate, Jesse Smith, 29, had tied them up with duct tape and zip ties in their upscale Astoria apartment on Monday, and ordered them at gunpoint to sell their assets.
Capobianco told police at least one other person besides Smith was involved in the act.
The Queens District Attorney's office believes Capobianco's account but still hopes to convict them of murder because they escaped their bindings and went to another room where they snatched a hammer and clobbered Smith, their captor and business partner.
“I grabbed the hammer from the kitchen and hit Jessie three or four times until they were unconscious,” Capobianco told the police.
Capobianco and Smith ran a currency exchange business centered around Bitcoin, an online currency, according to government records and Bitcoin sites.
Sources told DNAinfo New York that Smith had argued with the young trader over damage done to the apartment in the Exo building at 26-28 21st St. about 3:30 p.m. Monday before tying them up.
Capobianco's lawyer Ronald Bekoff said it was too early to comment further on their client's case, although they confirmed that the 18-year-old had a black eye — though they couldn't say how they got it.
Capobianco was charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon at Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens. Judge Elisa Koenderman ordered them held on $250,000 bond.

Newcastle United's future is a little clearer today – and a looks a lot less scary.
It is not as frightening as watching the up-to-date Premier League table on the BBC website which for two short spells – although they felt like an ice age – showed Newcastle were third bottom.
There could have been few other games not involving Newcastle over the years which meant so much to the club such as the one between Wigan Athletic and Swansea.
If Alan Pardew was true to their word then they did not watch the action from the DW Stadium because “he had had enough nerves for a week.”
The manager's nerves would have been shot if they had tuned into this game.
Twice Wigan took the lead and twice Pardew's side were sent bottom of a mini-league of seven teams fighting to stay in the Premier League – and for all the world looking like favourites to go down. Yet Swansea did Pardew, Newcastle United and their supporters a huge turn by scoring three goals to win a game that, in all honesty, meant little to their own players.
Newcastle fans themselves did not know whether to go for a long walk to avoid going through the agony of watching what was happening through in Lancashire.
Some watched. Others took to the drink. Many did both.
Wigan, who have the joy of a FA Cup fnal on Saturday, were superb going forward and scored two good goals through Roger Espinoza and James McCarthy to lead 2-1 with almost an hour gone.
Thankfully for all in the North East – and that does mean everyone – Wigan's defending was atrocious and a goal by Swansea's Dwight Tiendalli won the game for the Welshmen and kept the Magpies fourth from bottom and crucially out of the relegation zone.
It is hardly a boast, I know, but Newcastle will take that with two games to go.
Tiendalli's scrambled goal is as important as any last-minute winner from Papiss Cisse.
However, let's forget what has been and concentrate on what needs to be.
Newcastle will believe, with some justification, a win against QPR this Sunday will be enough.
If Aston Villa lose at home to Chelsea on Saturday, then a win at Loftus Road would mean Newcastle are safe for the simple-ish reason Villa and Wigan play each other in the final game.
If that sequence of results happens, then both those club cannot finish above Newcastle.
Got that?
If Wigan lose to Arsenal next midweek at the Emirates, which you would have to say is likely, then they are down so long as Newcastle, Sunderland and Norwich, who are all on 38 points, do not lose this weekend.
So, really, Newcastle would have to really blow it to be relegated.
However, to put this crazy season into some perspective, Fulham on 40 points and in 12th place could still be relegated and finish in the top ten. It is unlikely, but not impossible.
Don't write off Wigan just yet. They showed last night they will always score goals, but they now need to win their last two games.
It is looking bad for them and good for everyone else.
All the clubs near the bottom has a test of bottle in the penultimate round of fixtures.
Pardew and their players will come up against a QPR team which has won just four times in the league this season and came apart at the seams after week three.
Win and the United supporters are, you would imagine, spared a final day of nail-biting and listening to the radio, while hoping Arsenal, chasing a Champions League place, have an off day.
For once, the stars are lining for the men in black and white.
Wigan played well last night and still contrived to lose.
Their midfielder James McArthur missed a relatively easy chance to make it 3-1, moments before Swansea ran up the field and scored a second on their own.
On such small margins can club miss out on the biggest TV deal in football history.
Oh, and Newcastle owe Swansea's players a debt of gratitude for the way they turned up for a football match which meant little to them.
Now Newcastle's players need to turn up for a game which means everything. It is surely not a lot to ask.
The United States national team icon and Fulham legend spoke with ASN's Brian Sciaretta about a wide variety of topics including the Cottagers' search for a new coach, MLS, and Jurgen Klinsmann.

very little by way of introduction. A stalwart for the United States national team and a legend for Fulham, the Illinois native built their reputation on hard work, soccer smarts, and being one of the nicest guys in the game.
Recently McBride was named to Fulham's official search committee to hire a new coach following the dismissal of Felix Magath. In the end, Kit Symons was promoted from within the Fulham organization and McBride was both excited by the hire and was happy to help out their former club.
In a wide-ranging interview, ASN's Brian Sciaretta spoke with McBride about numerous topics including Fulham, MLS, the U.S. national team, and their future plans in the game.
: As we all know, Fulham had a very difficult start to the season. Felix Magath was fired on September 18 and youth coach Kit Symons was named interim manager. The search committee then named Symons the full-time head coach. How do you like the direction of the club at the moment?
: I think what Kit has done is come in and change the morale of the group. They really got everyone playing for the team. I think there were a few people who didn't get on with the former manager. Sometimes when that happens, it's kind of tough to bring those players back from the mindset of really thinking they're not going to be a part of the team. Kit has done a great job in doing that. Not only that, he's just turned things around almost 180 degrees. I know there are some games we tied recently that we would have loved to have won but they deserve a lot of credit.
: What has been your relationship with the club since you left to return to MLS? Being named to the committee suggests that a strong bond between you and Fulham still exists. Are you still involved?
: Since I left, I was much more on the periphery than involved. Still, I was just like a lot of ex-players who played at Fulham—feeling very passionate and paying attention and always checking to see how they're doing. While I've been in the States, I had contact with a few of the people who are on the staff. When Clint Dempsey was there, I'd talk to them a little bit more often.
Recently, it became a little bit more—of course with them asking me to be part of the committee but even before that with [American owner] Shahid Khan's group. It was them reaching out to say hello and getting to know me a bit better. I'm getting to know a lot more about the ownership group from the dealing of what is going on. I've really enjoyed it.
: Did being part of the search committee and having an official role for the team remind you of how much you missed the club? What were your emotions towards the process? Did it take you by surprise that they asked you?
: It's always been there. I've always wanted to be a part of it. In fact there were times I reached out and said, “If there is any way I can ever help or do anything for the club, please reach out to me and I will gladly help if I can.”
: You were part of some memorable moments for Fulham and you helped the club fend off relegation a few times including that amazing 2007-2008 season when the Cottages escaped relegation. How much of a setback was it for the club to get relegated last season and what are the club's plans to make a quick return—if not this year than in the next few?
: It was a huge disappointment, of course, for everybody who was ever at the club or more so for the people who were there to experience that. Having been in that situation and staying up the last season I was there, it pulls at your heartstrings a little bit more. But there definitely is a very big commitment from the ownership group, from what I've seen, to try and do everything they can to get back into the Premier League. By no means is it a short-sighted thing. I think they definitely have a vision to push the club back there and really be a club that matters in the Premier League.
: It seems like a huge part of the push is the club's youth movement which has achieved some impressive results in England in recent years.
: It has. Of course it's always a more gentle transition that you'd rather have with some of the young and talented players you have coming through. You sort of want to have the Scottie Parkers, the leaders on your team, and having the veterans showing the way of how it is to be a good professional and to really grow into your career. But certainly, there's definitely a huge amount of talent in the youth side. It speaks loudly for what the youth program has done.
: Fulham has tremendous ties with American players, including you, Clint Dempsey, Eddie Johnson, Carlos Bocanegra, Eddie Lewis, Kasey Keller, and Marcus Hahnemann. As someone who was such a key part of that, was American influence coincidental or did the club perhaps believe in the American player more than other teams?
: It was a little bit more coincidental than anything else. Chris Coleman, the coach who brought me over, could see a lot of attributes [in American players]. During the time I was there, if we finished midtable, it would be great; the top half of the season would be amazing, More than likely, you'd be fighting to stay in the league. I think [Coleman] knew that they needed players that were willing to put in the hard work—and not just Americans.
: While you said it is a coincidence, Emerson Hyndman is continuing that tradition today. Have you had a chance to watch them much this year or speak with him?
: I haven't reached out or talked with them but I've certainly seen them play a few times. Yeah, you can see the talent is there. Of course the history with their family is very soccer-oriented. There is a lot going for him. At Fulham right now, especially with Kit being the coach, they understand the strengths and weaknesses of all the players breaking in right now. They have a lot of positives happening right now in that movement.
: Since you've retired, you've had your academy and you've also been commentating on television. Is this what we should expect from you in the future, or do you have any longer-term goals in the sport?
: That's a good question, a very relevant question. I certainly will be making some decisions here. I have made a few already made but I'd rather not bring them up now. There definitely will be some changes in a very positive way for myself. But long term I want to stay involved in high-level soccer.
: The U.S. national team will be playing Colombia at Craven Cottage later this month. Will you be in attendance?
: At the moment I'm not planning to attend. I would love to, of course. But I think it's a great opportunity. I am very excited about the current players on the U.S. national team that are going to get a chance to play such a great stadium. When I say great, it's not this huge 80,000 seat stadia. It's a stadium with a lot of character and tradition and history that you can just feel when you walk into it. I'm looking forward to hearing what some of the players have to say about it.
: Your reputation at Fulham is so strong that the pub inside Craven Cottage is named after you. I've been told that the American Outlaws are planning a big pregame event at McBride's. What do you think about that?
: Really? Wow. Well, it's a long bar. I'm not so sure what kind of food they have, but there's plenty of beer. I want them to enjoy themselves like they always do and continue with the amazing support that give all the national teams.
: What are your thoughts on the U.S. national team since the new cycle began?
: I think it's going to be a transition period before qualifying starts—which is something that always has to happen after a World Cup. Certainly Jurgen has a vision and he's had a vision for a very long time of where they want U.S. Soccer to go. I think it's a good vision. There are times when people question some of the decisions but the one thing you can't question is their knowledge and their understanding of what they want to get out of the players. Having that foresight into the longer term is only going to help.
Of course there are question marks of who is really going to be mainstays but I think we've got a great base with Matt Besler in the centerback position, which is always important. Omar Gonzalez actually had a very good World Cup and they continue to show growth. Clint still has a lot to offer alongside many other players who will continue to make an impact. Jozy is still very young.
I think it's a bright future. When you look at it, you certainly want to be able to call on depth in case of injuries. The nice thing gain is that you have a year-and-a-half before qualifying. I don't expect anything less than getting to go the World Cup. Once you're there, getting out of the group is always going to be your first goal but I think that the results leading up to that will determine what the expectations are.
: You had two stints in Major League Soccer—with the Columbus Crew and the Chicago Fire. There has been a lot of talk recently about how the league prepares players for the next level. How satisfied are you with the direction of the league and how do you think of it as a place for younger players?
: I think you have to view it as very positive growth. Certainly the talent among players that are not necessarily marquee names is better because they have a better understanding of the game. I still think that is probably going to be our biggest necessity to growing—to have players that understand the game. When they're in a certain position, they should be doing this, or if they are in a certain position on the field, they should be doing this. The more players we have who are smart, it's only going to help us improve the league. We know we have players who are athletic, players who are technically talented. It's now combining that with a soccer brain. That is really going to make the next step for MLS.
: You were able to make a successful transition from the Crew to Europe. I know you had an initial stint in Germany as well as loans to Preston and Everton before Fulham, but how difficult is that transition? We see some players like Geoff Cameron make while others struggle. Why do you think it is so tough for Americans? What did you have overcome?
: I think it's easy to say it was successful for me but it was a transition the first six months—being in and out of the team, not necessarily playing some part in every game. Mentally that is the hardest part. For me, I was fortunate because I had already been to Europe right out of college for a year with Wolfsburg when they were in the second division and we had a good team.
But mentally I was just not prepared. It really affected me. It affected my ability to play. That's such a huge part of being able to make a transition from one place to another. It doesn't even have to mean between countries. It can be one city to the next city or one type of team to another. Fortunately I already had that experience and I knew what that would be about. Plus, I went on loan two times. So I had a good base. That's good and international soccer helped me before I made the move. Some players don't have that when they move over.
So the initial shock of everything outside of soccer is big. Then, of course, trying to adapt, step up, and prove yourself will always be difficult one. The ones that do it are probably just a little bit more prepared mentally and maybe even more physically.
: It's a different time right now with MLS. When you were in the league the first time, the best MLS players seemed to eventually find their way overseas. Now the best American players in Europe are finding their way back to MLS during their prime years. Did you ever expect you would see this trend?
: I think for the league to be considered one of the upper echelon leagues, it eventually had to do that. But I still think it's a ways off from that. Gradual growth is good. I'd like to see, of course, an increased salary cap for the players. One of the biggest differences is players have a lot of power in Europe. I don't know when you're going to have that here, but there will have to be some drastic changes in MLS. Some of those could good. Some of those could be bad. I'm not debating that. Certainly for the league to be considered upper echelon, you are going to need to have more players wanting to come here in their prime.
Thankfully, we're seeing some of that, but were also seeing some of the younger players who are talented international players who perhaps aren't necessarily brand name players willing to come, and that only helps the league.

Produced in Belgium by Sifaco Benelux S.A., Makla El Kantara Bentchikou is a menthol flavored variant of Makla, a traditional oral tobacco product which originates from North Africa. Makla is produced using a blend of selected and minced Rustica tobacco leaves combined with a special blend of natural texturing agents. Every can of Makla El Kantara Benchikou comes with 25 grams (.88 oz) of Makla. Although the cans are fairly small, makla contains a significant amount of nicotine and thus you'll be using less than you would snus or dip!
Not long after opening my can, I began to notice a strong menthol aroma, coupled with hints of very earthy tobacco in the background. Soon after putting a dime sized amount of makla in, I immediately started to feel a strong sensation of icy menthol, and as a big menthol fan I appreciated the taste. The menthol flavor was dominant and lasted for around ten minutes before slowly starting to diminish but remaining ever present until about the thirty minute mark. I also noticed just a hint of tobacco in the background, and it had a very earthy character to me.
The grind of Makla is extremely fine, and I would say that it resembles snus except becomes finer when in your mouth (I generally place it in my lower lip). Unlike snus and similar to dip, you'll need to spit while using makla. However, I didn't find myself spitting as much as I do with dip as I use much less makla in a session than I would dip. Within a few minutes I began to feel a strong nicotine buzz set in and it was very pleasant. The nicotine buzz generally lasted for around twenty five minutes before starting to diminish.
One other thing to keep in mind is that you should try to keep your can of makla horizontal as much as possible, as placing a Makla tin vertically may cause water to slowly seep out leading to the tobacco drying out faster.
As a whole, I must say that I really enjoyed my can of El Kantara Bentchikou. It has a unique taste and is very potent, meaning you can use less and still get a pleasant nicotine buzz. I highly recommend giving El Kantara Menthol a try if you're looking to try something totally new and mix up your daily rotation!

Curacao politician shot dead at beach
WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) - A Curacao official says a prominent politician in the Caribbean island's coalition government has been fatally shot.
Public Prosecutor Norman Serphos tells The Associated Press that lawmaker Helmin Wiels was killed Sunday at Marie Pompoen beach. They say witnesses reported seeing attackers shoot Wiels and then speed off in a car.
Wiels was the fiery leader of the Pueblo Soberano political party, which advocates for Curacao's independence. The island is a mostly autonomous "constituent country" of the Netherlands.
The pro-independence party led voting in October elections but holds only five of 21 seats in Parliament.

When Congress last voted on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in 2007, the bill would have prevented employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation but not gender identity or expression. House Democrats removed transgender protections from the legislation, claiming they wouldn't have enough votes to pass an inclusive ENDA.
"There is more resistance to protection for people who are transgender than for people who are gay, lesbian and bisexual," Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said in a statement at the time. "This is not a good fact, but ignoring bad facts is a bad way to get legislation passed."
The House did pass the bill, after quarreling over the non-inclusive language and repeatedly postponing a vote, but it died in the Senate. It was the seventh time ENDA had been introduced since 1994 when the first, non-inclusive version emerged. In 2009 and 2011, versions of the bill that did include gender identity language were introduced, but they languished in committee both times.
This year ENDA was reintroduced again — an inclusive version that would prohibit workplace discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation — and it must be passed by the Senate and the House before President Obama can sign it into law.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Monday that they plan to take up ENDA "soon" and told reporters last month about a personal reason they support a ban on workplace discrimination.
"My niece is a lesbian," they said. "She's a school teacher. Them employment shouldn't be affected with that. We should have a law that says that, not just the good graces of wherever you work."
In the West, everyone knows Florence Nightingale, in many ways the founder of modern nursing. But many centuries earlier, a woman named Rufaida Al-Aslamia introduced nursing to the Muslim world.  They are estimated to have been born in the year 620 — exactly 1,200 years before Florence Nightingale.
Just like Florence Nightingale, who became famous when tending for the wounded during the Crimean War, it was war that brought Al-Aslamia to nursing. They had learned many medical skills by assisting their father, who was a famous healer, and they converted to Islam after religion's “Holy Prophet”, Muhammad, settled in their hometown of Medina. During the early battles of their followers, they provided first aid to injured soldiers, made sure they had drinking water, and arranged shelter from the heat and the desert wind for the wounded and dying. And just like Nightingale, who trained a team of volunteer nurses, they did not go alone, leading a group of Muslim women to work with them
Once the wars were over, Muhammad gave Rufaida permission to erect a tent inside the Prophet's mosque (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi) in Madina to keep providing nursing care, and to train more Muslim women and girls as nurses. They advocated for preventative care and is even said to have drafted the world's first code of nursing conduct and ethics.
Since this all took place in very early history, our knowledge of their life is of course limited. Even how you write their name, exactly, depends on all kinds of transliteration issues and uncertainties: Rufaida Al-Asalmiya, Rufayda al-Aslamiyyah, Rufaidah Al-Aslamiyah, Rufayda Bint Sa'ad Al Aslamiyya? But they were praised for spending their life taking care of the sick and dying, looking after poor people, orphans and the handicapped, and providing the people of their city with health education.  They are described as having been patient, kind, devoted, and committed, and as a good organizer.
Stories about their work were passed on through the generations as oral history, but over time became forgotten. In recent decades, however, they have been rediscovered as the founder of nursing in the Muslim world, and several scholarly articles were written about them In one of the first, Suad Hussain concluded that “Rufaida devoted their life to the development and improvement of nursing. They succeeded in laying new rules and traditions as the basis of better nursing.” In Pakistan, a building at The Aga Khan University School of Nursing was named after them An annual Rufaida Al-Aslamia Prize in Nursing is awarded at the University of Bahrain.

While NBC's Constantine aims to be a more faithful adaptation by keeping them blonde, British, and decidedly not Keanu Reeves, one of their most defining characteristics has already been transformed by broadcast standards. “On network, it's the one thing, you can't smoke on network,” pilot director Neil Marshall tells Collider. “That's one of their character traits. We're working around that. We're trying to get aspects of it in there as much as possible. We'll see.”
Marshall didn't elaborate on how the show planned to have “aspects” of John Constantine's chain-smoking habit without ever showing them actually chain smoking—such as, for example, everyone always remarks on how super cool they are, and how he's obviously a rebel who doesn't have to take shit from anybody. But the smoking ban has preemptively ruled out one of Constantine's most identifiable attributes—not to mention the root of one of the series' most compelling storylines, crucial to both the comics and the 2005 movie, that ironically serves as an excellent anti-smoking PSA.

On the brighter side, as Hannibal has shown, you can force-feed a character their own body parts on NBC, so long as they don't enjoy a rich, satisfying smoke afterward. “Whatever the regulations are, you can be as dark and disturbing as you want and we're going to go in that direction. The intention is to be as dark and scary as possible with the show,” Marshall added. “But the smoking is very frustrating. Who knows where it will go; where the story will go; where the character will go?” Wherever that is, and however immersed in grisly murder and supernatural terror it may be, at least parents can be assured their kids won't see anyone smoking cigarettes.
Stephen Curry records 25 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds in the Warriors' 125-94 victory over the Bulls. With the win, Golden State improves to 20-4 on the road this season. (1:52)
CHICAGO -- Sports records mean less than the experiences they abridge, even if a numerical shorthand like "72 wins" endures. When the Golden State Warriors flayed the current Chicago Bulls 125-94 at United Center on Wednesday, the question of whether they'll eclipse the 1996 Bulls' 72 mark was paramount -- an obvious thematic connection asked about before and after the game. The question of whether they'll do it is interesting, but also somewhat bloodless. It says nothing about the incredible experience of watching either team.
Yes, "72" is a number, an impressive number to be sure, but just a number. If the Warriors do it, it'll be a resounding accomplishment. But it isn't how witnesses will relate to that feat. It isn't why thousands teemed at the pregame sidelines just to get a glimpse of Stephen Curry playing against an invisible defender.
People aren't tuning into this team because it can best Jordan's Bulls by some dry standard. They're watching because this greatness is charismatic, just the way it was back with Jordan's Bulls. People will obviously celebrate the Warriors more if they achieve historic success, but there's power in how the success is happening. It's fast-paced, fun and unselfish (38 assists for the team on Wednesday). It makes winning look good, and few things endure better than style melded with substance.

The power of memory was clear when after the game, Curry and Draymond Green discussed their own recollections of the 1990s Bulls. The current Chicago team still plays the same, famed introduction song it used back in Jordan's days. It's a song called "Sirius" by The Alan Parsons Project. Like so many basketball fans, Green knows it only by another moniker.
"I call it 'The Jordan song,' " Green said after a rugged game in which they took a shot to the face from Bulls forward Taj Gibson. "Every time I hear it, I think Michael Jordan. 'Number 23 Michael Jordan' about to be said. So, that's what the song is to me. I looked at Steph, and I'm just like, 'Yo.' And they looked back, like, 'Man, every time.' That song gets me every time."
Further acting out the conversation, Green continued: "You hear that, man? I just think back to those days watching Jordan, watching 'Space Jam,' all that stuff and it's just amazing."
Curry spoke of the feelings evoked, saying: "Me and Draymond were stretching on the scorer's table before the game. And you hear the intro song and the anthem. That brings back a lot of memories of watching the Jordan Bulls teams and all that and something that gets you a little goose-bump feeling."
There's some wonder in that, when you consider how differently Curry and Green grew up. Curry was wealthy, the son of an NBA player, someone who got to see Michael Jordan in person. Green grew up hardscrabble in Saginaw, Michigan. The toughness of their upbringing was referenced when they made an analogy between the accidental shot from Gibson to the fights of their youth. Through the magic of sports, Curry and Green share a connection to what stirred their souls as children.
It's happening right now -- not to the degree of Jordan's influence, but it's happening now. On Wednesday, the NBA announced that Curry's is its top-selling jersey. It's hardly shocking when one goes to these road arenas and sees so many kids in the 30 jersey. They resonate with young fans who see the flicked wrist as their only shot against hulking adversaries. All the better that when Curry dunked left-handed, as they did for the first time in their NBA career on Wednesday, it's considered a shocking event.
One play can summarize the resonance. With a little more than eight minutes left in the third quarter, Curry drove at Pau Gasol, reaching across the 7-footer's body. Gasol used their size, spreading their arms and swatting the scoop layup away. Curry casually collected the ricochet, and this time lofted the ball far higher, floating above Gasol's reach like an escaped balloon. The ball found net, the crowd reacted with "Oohhhs," and Gasol slumped in disgust. For a moment, height was decisive, as it's supposed to be in this big man's sport. That is, until Curry suddenly decided it wasn't.
There's more to the Golden State experience than just Curry, of course. There's Green's hyperdrive versatility. There's Klay Thompson's glorious streak shooting. There are Andrew Bogut's water-polo pass fakes and toss-ahead assists that remind of soccer "through balls." On Wednesday, we were treated to Leandro Barbosa looping an alley-oop to Andre Iguodala that looked more like a trapeze act than a basketball play.
You could have been satisfied Wednesday night, just watching Shaun Livingston's quirky game, one they have analogized to a pineapple upside-down cake. Livingston's approach is "inverted," as they call it, a point guard who posts up like a big man. Their balky back-and-forth rhythms could also remind of an Allen wrench, getting the job done, slowly rocking the defender into place.
Whatever the fans took from another Golden State blowout, it's better than the speculation such play inspires. Will they win 72? We can't know that yet, just like we can't know if they'll win titles beyond last season's. We can, however, surmise that their particular journey is connecting right now, in ways reminiscent of a not-so-distant past. Kids wanted to be like Mike. In increasing numbers, kids want to be like Steph. If the Warriors keep blitzing history in this fashion, those kids will, as adults, relate over how "amazing" this all was to witness.
Futurama is renowned for its hidden Easter eggs, some that even diehard fans couldn't have picked up on upon first viewing. That's because these little secrets foreshadow events and characters that wouldn't happen or appear until seasons later.
1. Leela's Parents in the Crowd
NY Mag
Leela's mutant parents can be seen standing in a crowd in the season two episode "I Second That Emotion." At this point in the series, Leela's origins were still a mystery. The audience wouldn't learn the truth until the season four episode "Leela's Homeworld," when those same parents are formally introduced.
2. Nibbler's Shadow in the Pilot
imgur
Nibbler's shadow can be seen underneath Fry's chair in the first episode, "Space Pilot 3000." Even though the character hadn't been introduced yet, Nibbler's presence in the pilot is explained years later in the season 4 episode ""The Why of Fry," when it is revealed that the critter pushed them into a cryogenic tank. In DVD commentary for the pilot, Matt Groening explains, "What we tried to do is we tried to lay in a lot of little secrets in this episode that would pay off later."
3. Killer Wasps and the Old Planet Express Crew

Speaking of the first episode, Professor Farnsworth retrieves Fry, Leela, and Bender's new career chips from a package labeled "Contents of Space Wasp's Stomach," implying the old crew was killed by space wasps. This foreshadows the season four episode "The Sting," in which we find out that this did in fact happen to the old crew as the new Planet Express gang are almost killed by giant space bees.
4. The Mysterious Number 9 Man
theinfosphere.org
A man wearing a tunic that says "Number 9" appears in the background many times throughout the series. (Here they are in " Bender's Big Score," again in "My Three Suns," in "How Hermes Requisitioned Their Groove Back," and also in random crowd shots.) They first showed up in the pilot, but wouldn't play a pivotal role until the 2010 Futurama movie, Into the Wild Green Yonder, a full eleven years (and one series cancellation) after their initial appearance. In the movie, it's revealed that the Number 9 Man is the leader of the "Legion of Mad Fellows," a group of telepaths.
5. Futurama itself was predicted by The Simpsons
The creation of Futurama itself was foreshadowed in the 1993 episode of The Simpsons, "The Front." In the episode, a writer resembling Futurama co-creator David X. Cohen exclaims, "I'm gonna do what I've always dreamed of. I'm gonna write that sitcom about the sassy robot." Futurama (and sassy robot Bender) wouldn't premier on Fox for another six years.
6. The Omission of Fry's Grandfather is for a reason
tvtome.com
In "The Luck of the Fryrish," Fry's father tells Fry's brother Yancy that their name (Yancy) has been passed down for generations, from their father's grandfather, to their grandfather, to him, then down to Yancy. They leaf out their own father (Yancy and Fry's grandfather) implying they were named something other than Yancy. This is because in the next-season episode "Roswell that Ends Well," it's revealed that Fry becomes their own grandfather.
Max Keeble's Big Move is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Tim Hill, written by David L. Watts, James Greer, Jonathan Bernstein and Mark Blackwell and starring Alex D. Linz, Larry Miller, Jamie Kennedy, Nora Dunn, and Robert Carradine.
The film was released in the United States on October 5, 2001 by Walt Disney Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $18 million against its $25 million budget.
Plot
Max Keeble is a paperboy who starts their first day of middle school. Max is antagonized by the corrupt megalomaniacal school principal, Elliot T. Jindrake, resident school bullies Troy McGinty and Dobbs, and the Evil Ice Cream Man. Max also learns that an animal shelter they visit next door to the school is being closed down to build Jindrake's opulent football stadium.
When Max's father, Donald, reveals that they are moving to Chicago for their boss, because they are unable to stand up for himself, Max realizes that they can do whatever they want to their tormentors, facing no consequences because they will be gone by then. Enlisting their equally socially outcast friends, Robe and Megan, Max sets up a variety of pranks, which include traumatizing Troy by playing the main theme song of the children's television show MacGoogle the Highlander Frog (which frightened them as a child), then trapping them in the gym with a MacGoogle costume wearer; instigating a fight between Dobbs and the Evil Ice Cream Man by stealing the coolant coil for the ice cream truck and Dobbs's handheld device; and ruining Jindrake's chances of becoming successor to the current superintendent, Bobby "Crazy Legs" Knebworth (an alumnus who was a star football player for the school) by planting animal pheromones within their breath spray, instigating a food fight in the cafeteria in view of Superintendent Knebworth, and later by sabotaging their TV announcements by placing a cardboard cutout of Max mocking him.
After their missions are completed, Max ends up ditching Robe and Megan's going away party by accepting an invitation to a milkshake party hosted by their crush Jenna, causing a falling-out. Taking Max's earlier advice to heart, Don announces that they quit their job and started their own business, meaning that Max is not moving after all. Max freaks out at this news, and learns that other students at their school are suffering because of their actions.
Max confronts Jindrake, Troy, and Dobbs one final time, and with the help of other students at their school, Max eventually defeats Troy and Dobbs for good by throwing them into the dumpster with their schoolmates' help and stops Jindrake from demolishing the animal shelter. Jindrake is fired for manipulating with the school budget to build their stadium due to Max tricking Jindrake into publicly admitting to their crimes earlier.
The film ends when Max rides on their bicycle delivering newspapers around their neighborhood, and the Evil Ice Cream Man starts pursuing them once again.

Leon Camier turned a lot of heads at Indianapolis in their first ride on the Drive M7 Aspar Honda production racer. The Englishman was drafted in to replace Nicky Hayden while they recover from surgery, but despite it being the first time they rode a MotoGP bike, the Bridgestone tires, carbon brakes, and the Indianapolis circuit, Camier was very quickly up to speed with the other Open class Hondas.
Having a fast rider come in to MotoGP from World Superbikes allows a number of comparisons to be made. Among the most interesting is the difference in technology and tires. At Brno, Camier explained the difference in feel and cornering between the World Superbike Pirellis and the MotoGP Bridgestones. The front tire, especially, is a completely different kettle of fish, requiring a different style, and therefore different set up.
"The main [differene] for me is the tires and the brakes," Camier told us, "the tires being the biggest one. It's just that you have so much more front grip and with angle that you can brake and turn in with the brake on. [The front tire] is adjusting itself to be able to do that."
That difference presented a major challenge, Camier explained. "If you don't have enough weight on the front tire late in the corner, the bike doesn't turn. So you have to be able to go in fast enough to be able to load the bike that late on in the corner. Which is hard, because you need the setting to be right for that."
This was the stage at which Camier and their crew had arrived. "That's what we are trying to find at the moment, trying to find the right balance for that. At the minute, the bike's quite soft, and I can roll round the track quite nicely, but to go faster, I need to start braking later, turning in with the brake on, and bury the front tire."
Burying the front tire was the key to going fast. With the World Superbike Pirellis, the key was to brake, release the brake to allow the tire to resume some of its shape, and then use this shape to get the bike to turn. Respected MotoGP journalist Mat Oxley, also present, put the historical example of Simon Crafar riding Dunlops during the 500cc era. Crafar, Oxley said, would use the point at which the bike deflected back to its normal shape to help hook the bike round the corner, and assist turn in.
Camier recognized this from World Superbikes. "That's more like a Pirelli," Camier said. "You go in with the thing absolutely buried, and you have to sort of get it up off the tire for it to come into a more normal shape to turn." The Bridgestones are the opposite, Camier said. You do not wait to stop braking before turning in, you turn the bike into the corner when the front tire is loaded up under braking. "This turns when it's flattened," Camier said. "And it does turn. But the grip is so much more as well. It takes some getting your head around."
The First Minister warned that Scots who back the Tories will cause 'deeper cuts'.
Independence: Nicola Sturgeon said they would set out their plans for EU membership at a later date. PA
The general election is not about deciding if Scotland should be independent or not, the First Minister has said.
Scots will go to the polls on June 8 in a snap vote called by the Prime Minister last week.
The election comes shortly after Sturgeon called for a second independence referendum after Downing Street rejected their plans to keep Scotland inside the European single market even if the rest of the UK left.
The SNP leader warned Scottish voters who back the Conservatives in June's election will enable Theresa May to carry out "deeper cuts" on the country's public services.
Sturgeon made the comments in an interview on STV's Scotland Tonight programme.
They said the forthcoming vote "is not deciding whether or not Scotland is independent" and added it would be for a subsequent debate about the country's future where they "would have to set out the process for resecuring our future with Europe."
Sturgeon told STV they want Scotland to be a "full member of the European Union" because it is in the country's interests "particularly in the European single market."
The First Minister declined, however, to say their party's forthcoming would contain a pledge for an independent Scotland to apply for EU membership.
Two opinion polls published on Sunday show the Conservatives are on course to unseat a number of SNP MPs on June 8.
Sturgeon warned Scots from backing the party at the poll.
They said: "There is no cost free, tactical Tory vote in this election.
"If people vote Tory then what they are doing is what the Prime Minister has asked them to do which is to strengthen them hand.
"Strengthening the hand of a Tory government has big implications for Scotland and the UK as a whole.
"It will mean more austerity, deeper cuts, and the voice of the Scottish Parliament being steamrollered so my message in this election is 'if you do not want the Tories to be strengthened and emboldened and instead you want to have a strong opposition and Scotland's voice being heard then loudly and clearly then the only way to do that is to vote SNP."
A Conservative spokesperson said: "These are desperate comments from a First Minister who's rattled and watching Scotland turn its back on their separation obsession.
"People are fed up with the SNP's grievance agenda, and will make that clear at the ballot box."
You can watch the full Scotland Tonight interview with the First Minister at 10.30pm on STV.
Their last Facebook post was perhaps the only clue of Raed Jaradat's yearning for vengeance: it showed a Palestinian teenager lying dead with their headscarf soaked in blood and the message “Imagine if this were your sister.” Dania Irsheid, 17, had been shot by Israeli security forces in October 2015 at the entrance to the Ibrahimi mosque (Jews call it the Cave of the Patriarchs) in Hebron. Police said they had tried to stab Israelis; Palestinian witnesses say they were unarmed.
The next day Raed, a 22-year-old accounting student from the town of Sair, near Hebron, went to a checkpoint nearby and stabbed an Israeli soldier in the neck before he, too, was shot dead. Later their 19-year-old cousin, Iyad, was killed during stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops. Raed and Dania had never met but, at their funeral, their fathers said their children should be married “in Paradise”.

Such is the rhythm of the Palestinian “stabbing intifada”. Since its outbreak in late 2015, there have been hundreds of knife and car-ramming attacks against Israelis. If the violence has ebbed, it may be in part because the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have become better at forestalling attacks. Israeli spooks reckon they have lessons to offer Western countries struggling to stop lone wolves.
One is that conventional intelligence organisations, even Israel's well-honed system, are designed to penetrate organised terrorist groups, so they struggle to spot imminent attacks by self-radicalised individuals or small groups. After reviewing the profiles of scores of attackers, IDF intelligence officers found they often acted on the spur of the moment. They were rarely linked to militant factions, and were not especially religious or poor. Many had a grievance: a son who felt unjustly treated, a brother who was disinherited, a bride who was beaten by their husband, and so on.
Sometimes they were teenagers bullied at school who wanted to be admired as “martyrs”—Clark Kent becomes Superman, as one officer put it. Often they were so inept that they appeared to be trying to commit “suicide by IDF”. And, as with teenage suicides, there was a pattern of copycat attacks, or at least a tendency of those close to a “martyr” to seek revenge. In Sair, for instance, 13 people have died since 2015 in attacks on, or confrontations with, Israelis.
These days IDF algorithms monitor the social-media accounts of young Palestinians to look for early-warning signs. These include “tripwire” terms such as the “sword of Allah” or “day of the sword”, associated with the writings of past attackers. The IDF also monitors the activity of relatives, friends, classmates and co-workers of recent “martyrs”.
The parents of those deemed suspicious might receive a telephone call or a visit from the Shin Bet security service, and their names could be passed on to the Palestinian Authority. Their phones are tracked to see if they meet other suspects, or leave their districts to move towards potential Israeli targets. In such cases, security forces detain the suspect.
How much of this could be applied in the West? Perhaps not much. Israel holds millions of Palestinians under occupation. Its security barriers restrict their movement and keep them segregated. The army can seal off restive areas, enforce curfews and impose punishments, such as the demolition of homes. In contrast, most Muslims in the West move and mix freely as full citizens. Israeli-style ethnic profiling and ubiquitous electronic surveillance would be neither possible nor desirable.
Still, cleverly fusing clues from social media with other information might help, as could early intervention to steer suspects away from possible violence. That means keeping would-be attackers online, where they can be watched.
Biotech company Sage Therapeutics has announced that their experimental postpartum depression drug was able to relieve symptoms in 70 percent of patients. The drug was tested in a Phase II clinical trial, which found that severe symptoms of depression could be put into remission for a month.
While the initial results look promising, the study did contain a few limitations. For one, the sample size was only 21 patients, with no follow-up after 30 days of the study.
According to Sage, the drug was well-tolerated among participants and no serious adverse events were reported. The company has not released all study data however, instead choosing to save some for a future medical conference.
Not long ago, postpartum depression was a nearly-unrecognized condition despite its prevalence in new mothers. While reliable statistics on the prevalence of postpartum depression are hard to come by, Sage estimates that 10 to 15 percent of the 4 million mothers who give birth to live babies each year, are affected by the condition in some way.
The company's experimental treatment – named SAGE-547 – is delivered intravenously, making it ideal for patients who are hospitalized as a result of severe depressive symptoms. According to Sage, the drug is an allosteric modulator which interacts with the GABA A receptor, a key component in signals propagated by neurotransmitters.
Ten of the 21 patients enrolled in the Phase II clinical trial were given SAGE-547, while the remaining 11 participants were given a placebo. Some patients experienced improvement in their symptoms as early as 24 hours after the drug was administered.
Using the standard HAM-D depression scoring system, the researchers found that seven out of ten women on the postpartum drug saw their condition go into remission within 60 hours of receiving the treatment. This was compared to one out of the 11 patients in the placebo arm of the study, who saw improvement.
After 30 days, all seven patients on SAGE-547 were doing well, compared to two patients receiving the placebo. While the drug has so far only been tested on a relatively small number of women, the results are nevertheless very encouraging for a historically difficult-to-treat patient group.
“This is potentially one of the most important clinical findings in the pharmacologic treatment of postpartum depression to date,” said primary investigator Samantha Meltzer-Brody, an associate professor and director of the UNC Perinatal Psychiatry Program. Sage plans to further investigate the postpartum depression drug by enrolling more patients in the clinical trial to determine the optimal dose. The company also plans to develop an oral form of the medication.
When estimating the size of the marijuana industry and its stupendous growth, it's always a measure of billions—as in how many billions of dollars are available to entrepreneurs or investors seeking a piece. Most peg the cannabis industry's current size as around $10 billion or so, with increases of 100 percent possible by 2020. But it only took days, not years, after California and three other states legalized adult-use cannabis—increasing the number of Americans living under legalization to 65 million—for the cannabis industry's first billion-dollar company to emerge.
But it's not in California, the U.S.'s “marijuana basket” where as much as 70 percent of the nation's herb is grown. Nor is it in Colorado, which has been the country's de-facto capital of legal cannabis commerce since the state legalized in 2012.
It's in Canada, the new-and-future home of marijuana-related commerce in North America.
Shares in Canopy Growth—headquartered in Ontario and operating out of a repurposed chocolate factory—had increased by 386 percent as of Friday to establish itself as the very first marijuana-powered “unicorn.” (Full disclosure: This writer holds a very small position in the company, and wishes wholeheartedly they had had the foresight to sink their entire 401k and every other penny of their limited wealth and that of their friends and relatives into the firm.)
That's growth no “Uber of pot” or any other American company can match or even hope to approach, no matter how many states legalize—because for now, Canadian companies have an insurmountable competitive advantage: legitimacy.
Every American businessperson and entrepreneur dealing directly with the cannabis plant is breaking federal law. This is why dispensaries and cultivators have trouble opening a bank account and are routinely audited by the IRS—and forget even thinking about interstate commerce.
In Canada, more than 40 companies have licenses from Health Canada to produce medical cannabis. That's right—licenses from the federal government. Until American companies can claim that status, they'll always be playing catch-up to northern counterparts.
“The longer it takes for U.S. federal law to deem marijuana legal, the longer the Canadian licensed producers have to establish more international partnerships and create higher barriers to entry,” Dundee Capital Markets analyst Daniel Pearlstein told The Financial Post, adding that even the most advanced American company is “three to four years behind” Canada.
Put another way: The feds are screwing the American marijuana industry.
And Americans are well aware. The principals of weed-focused equity firm Privateer Holdings have invested heavily in Canadian companies, including British Columbia-based Tilray.
This situation was inconceivable even recently—and shows how much America's attitude on the drug has relaxed, and how little political capital the country has to spend on drug policy. You may recall the time, not too long ago, when the U.S. successfully bullied Canada into dropping a plan to decriminalize marijuana.
In 2004, then-President George W. Bush's ambassador used threats of decreased trade and a “border crackdown” to help convince Canadian lawmakers to back off of relaxing marijuana laws. That display ensured Dubya was greeted by marijuana smoke as well as antiwar protesters during their state visit the following year, but it also set things back in Canada by several years, and led to moronic statements from Stephen Harper, the country's Conservative former prime minister, that marijuana is “infinitely worse” than tobacco.
Now, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party back in power and cannabis legalization a key plank in the party platform—federal licenses! In a legalized market!!—Canada's cannabis industry leaders are poised to grow even bigger.
This is a near-total turnaround that isn't likely to change anytime soon—not under President Donald Trump. While Trump the candidate said on the campaign trail that he'd respect state law and leave legalized states be, much will hinge on who they name to the Supreme Court and to lead their Justice Department.
But to cross the final frontier, Canadian cannabis firms will need help from Trump & Company. That frontier is the border itself—and how to reach a point when Canadian cannabis can be legally shipped south to consumers in the United States.
Brendan Kennedy, Privateer's CEO, thinks that day is within sight. And with so much money at stake—the entity which Trump respects more than anything else, judging on their life and their campaign—it may be an easier sell than we know.

Like a defecting Syrian colonel or converted climate-change denier, Sanford I. Weill has been heartily welcomed among those on the right side of history.
The sheer inappropriateness of the vessel, the breathtaking audacity of the messenger, can oddly confer authority on an idea. If even the creator of Citigroup now believes that the giant banks should be broken up, who could not believe it?
Their belated conversion is only the latest from the corner-office-to-Zuccotti-Park banking crowd. The former merger aficionado Philip J. Purcell, who headed up the pithily named Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover, wrote a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article suggesting that shareholders should break up the banks. Sallie Krawcheck, a former top-ranking Wall Street executive, recently criticized big banks. Two other former top executives, David H. Komansky and John S. Reed, have attacked the current financial system.
These converts tend to have followed a similar path. They participated in the merger frenzy and pushed deregulation when the getting was good. They departed from finance's sweet embrace sometimes involuntarily, ousted in power struggles. And they stayed quiet, or did little, throughout the debates on how to fix the system when the nation was struggling over the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul.
That's when it would have mattered.
Those who are left defending the banking status quo are on an island. These are current bank executives — who can be counted on to change their views the instant they lose out in the corporate race and are booted from the organization with engorged severance packages — and the politicians and lobbyists who love them.
And so what? Supporters of change can win all the intellectual arguments they want; the structure of the financial system remains intact.
As every frustrated American knows, no major banking executive has gone to prison or has been fined any significant amount in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
But what's astonishing is that Wall Street bankers seem not to have paid any social cost either. They sit on corporate and nonprofit boards and attend functions and galas. They remain top Wall Street executives, or even serve as regulators. The nation's prominent op-ed pages, talk shows and conferences seek their opinions. If you are rich, you must be intelligent. Your views must be worthwhile, never mind the track record.
The embrace of Mr. Weill sets a new standard for reputation rehabilitation.
Some disagree that they played a central role in creating the modern financial system that blew up the world economy. Perhaps. But these people must concede that they failed on their own terms as a business person.
Sandy Weill was a deal maker who aspired to more. They had a vision to create a financial supermarket. The scrappy public school graduate from the streets of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn realized their dream and created Citigroup.
And it didn't work.
Mr. Weill's only unambiguous success was to make themselves enormously rich.
By the mid-2000s, Citigroup was a flop. The business synergies never materialized and the stock was lagging. Its chief executive then, Charles O. Prince, was divesting divisions. In 2007, investors and analysts called for the very sort of breakup that Mr. Weill now endorses. Then the financial crisis hit and the government had to bail out the behemoth Mr. Weill created.
Their institution had also served as a (unheeded) harbinger of the banking rot to come. Throughout the 2000s, Citigroup was riddled with scandal. It settled with the Federal Trade Commission over deceptive practices. Its CitiFinancial unit was embroiled in predatory lending controversies before it was fashionable. The bank was an entwined backer of both Enron and WorldCom. Citigroup employed Jack Grubman, who was at the heart of the research conflict-of-interest scandals of the early 2000s. Even back in their less reflective days, Mr. Weill had to apologize for that.
Things got so bad that the otherwise somnolent Federal Reserve actually banned Citi from making any more acquisitions while it sorted out its mess.
What's a guy gotta do around here to lose a little credibility?
Our society wasn't always this way. In Edith Wharton's novel “The Age of Innocence,” set in the 1870s, the arriviste Julius Beaufort's bank fails (it appears not to be fraud, just recklessness). Mr. Beaufort is banished from New York society for a generation.
After the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, major Wall Street figures populated prisons, not presidential advisory panels. The head of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Whitney, who hailed from one of the most patrician families in America, went to Sing Sing for embezzlement.
In 1936, Roosevelt gave their famous speech listing reckless banking and speculation among the "enemies of peace." These enemies hated them and they asserted, “I welcome their hatred.”
It wasn't just rhetoric. F.D.R.'s appointees “were neither impressed by, nor subservient to, bankers,” said Eric Rauchway, a historian from the University of California, Davis. Roosevelt appointed people like William O. Douglas, the future Supreme Court justice, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They threatened to nationalize the stock exchange.
No such situation for us today. Our meager lot is to celebrate when these guys change their minds.
Squirrels are scarce in literature, but the few appearances they have made are telling. Herman Melville identified the flying squirrel as the fiction writer's model for a realistic character: The creature is exactly as weird and incongruous as an actual person. One of Kafka's most unsung creatures was a squirrel whose “bushy tail was famous in all the forests,” and whom they describe, in a jot in their notebooks, as “always traveling, always searching.” However, “it couldn't talk about this, not because it lacked the power of speech but because it had absolutely no time.”
Our respect for squirrels as fellow commuters is all the more extraordinary when we consider that they belong to the hated Rodentia order. But squirrels' stylish outerwear and good manners make them kindred city folk — so much so that we pay them the ultimate urban compliment: We totally ignore them.
Yes, there's tension. The squirrel is not man's best friend, but more like an honored frenemy. Squirrels are probably a bit too similar to us for comfort: They are workaholics, road-ragers and inadequate dads. They can be territorial and unkind to outsiders. They have been known to help themselves to the fruits of private gardens. I know this from experience. When I was young and Orthodox, a squirrel absconded with my yarmulke, which I had taken off my head while playing basketball. I tracked them to the woods, to their home tree, and I watched them clamber up to the snug opening of their den, a gap between the branches, through which they gleefully — or so it seemed to me — disappeared, along with my former yarmulke.
Squirrel panic is not unknown in our country. According to an anti-squirrel website, John C. Inglis, former deputy director of the N.S.A., supposedly said, “Frankly, the No. 1 threat experienced to date by the U.S. electrical grid is squirrels.” Of course the counterargument is so ethically unambiguous it's no wonder an N.S.A. officer would miss it. The problem, as always, is our own rapacious overuse of energy, our own monstrous overbuilding of infrastructure, not the few squirrels who are the ensnared victims of it.
We would do well to take small acts of squirrel sabotage as a gift, a free warning about overstepping boundaries and a reminder of the need to share. Minor clashes with squirrels, the occasional breaches in the grid or the loss of a yarmulke here or a kumquat there serve only as reminders that we can, if we choose, afford to live in respectful peace with our neighbors.

They're not the best fighters in the UFC, but Paige VanZant, Sage Northcutt and Mickey Gall are proving they're already among the company's biggest draws.
The show on Fox Saturday featuring the three young up-and-comers at Golden1 Arena in Sacramento averaged 3.2 million viewers for the entire show, and peaked at 4.8 million viewers during Michelle Waterson's first-round submission victory over VanZant in the card's main event.

The show's ratings were the highest for a UFC show on Fox since April 20, 2013, when Benson Henderson defeated Gilbert Melendez in San Jose, Calif., in a lightweight title bout. It was the No. 2 show in primetime on broadcast and cable on Saturday among males 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54.
UFC president Dana White heaped praise on Northcutt and Gall, who were discovered on their web series, “Dana White: Lookin' for a Fight,” as well as VanZant. They appeared on ABC's “Dancing with the Stars,” earlier this year and that season ended up averaging 11.5 million viewers. White said that Northcutt's episode of “Lookin' for a Fight” has three million views, while Gall's has two million.
“There's something about them and they have that star quality where people are interested in seeing them,” they said. “Sage is ripped and is an unbelievable physical specimen. Mickey was on the show and then they fought [ex-WWE champion] CM Punk and Paige had that exposure on ‘Dancing with the Stars.' If you get out there and promote yourself, this shows you that you have a chance.”
Saturday's show, which included four fights, grew 28 percent from beginning to end. It also included popular bantamweight Urijah Faber's retirement fight. But even after Faber's fight, which was second on the broadcast, was off, ratings continued to rise.

It drew 574,000 adults 18-34; 1.4 million among adults 18-49 and had 905,000 males 18-49.
It was a big show that will lead into what is expected to be another major one. UFC 207 on Dec. 30 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas features the return of Ronda Rousey, as they fight for the first time in 13 months when they meet Amanda Nunes for the women's bantamweight title. The show is on a Friday instead of its normal Saturday, which will probably cut into the sales, but it's still likely to exceed 1 million in sales.
CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. flag makers said on Tuesday they will stop manufacturing and selling Confederate battle flags in the wake of last week's attack on worshipers at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina.

Reggie VandenBosch, vice president of sales at the privately owned Valley Forge Flag, said the Pennsylvania-based company came to the decision as pressure grew on South Carolina to remove the banner from outside the State House in Columbia.
Annin Flagmakers, based in Roseland, New Jersey, announced later on Tuesday that it too would stop making the flag used by the pro-slavery Confederate states during the American Civil War of the 1860s.
Eder Flag Manufacturing, a flag maker based in Wisconsin, also said it would no longer sell or manufacture Confederate flags because of the Charleston shooting.
While some in South Carolina see the flag as a reminder of the state's proud history of defying federal authority, many others view it as a shameful tribute to the institution of slavery, once a pillar of the U.S. South's plantation economy.
“We hope that this decision will show our support for those affected by the recent events in Charleston and, in some small way, help to foster racial unity and tolerance in our country,” Valley Forge Flag said in a statement.
The 133-year-old company sells millions of flags each year, VandenBosch said, with Confederate flags making up only a tiny slice of that business.
Annin makes some 10 million flags every year, and only about 1,000 of them are Confederate flags, said Mary Repke, the company's vice president of marketing.
The flags are popular in Civil War re-enactments, they said.
According to Annin's website, the company supplied the U.S. flags for Union troops during the Civil War, and an Annin flag draped the coffin of slain U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.
According to Valley Forge Flag's website, its American flags accompanied astronauts on Apollo space missions and landing parties on the beaches of Normandy during World War Two.
Eder said it made its decision because longtime former owner Eugene Eder fought in World War II “against the forces of bigotry, hatred and tyranny” and wanted to produce American flags as symbols of freedom and opportunity.
“Our hope moving forward is that all communities are able to live together in unity so that everyone can experience the freedom and opportunity for which Mr. Eder and so many other veterans fought,” said Jodi Goglio, chief operating officer, in a statement.
Supporters say the Confederate flag is a reminder of South Carolina's heritage and a memorial to Southern casualties during America's 1861-65 Civil War.
The flag, however, has also long been embraced by white supremacists. Last week, photos emerged online of Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old white man charged with murdering nine worshipers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, posing with the flag.

The photographs prompted renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be removed from the capitol grounds.
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley on Monday called on lawmakers to take down the flag, saying it does “not represent the future of our great state.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Sears Holdings Corp said they would stop selling products bearing the Confederate flag.
On Tuesday, online auction site eBay Inc said it would ban Confederate flags and related items containing the flag's image from its website as it had become a “contemporary symbol of divisiveness and racism.”
Indian Muslims in Lucknow on their way to Saudi Arabia, covered by Hajj subsidy (air tickets)
The Haj subsidy is a subsidy that is given to Indian Muslim Hajj pilgrims by the Government of India in form of discounted Air fares on Indian Government owned Air India. The program has its origins in British colonial era.[1] In post-colonial era, the Government of India expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.[2] The subsidy initially applied to Indian Muslim pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Haj subsidy started in 1954, as an idea initiated by the then government, with flights between Mumbai and Jeddah. Additional flight legs were added over the years, and since 1984, all Haj traffic has been shared by Air India and Saudia, the national carriers of India and Saudi Arabia. The monopoly of these airlines has proven the most contentious point of the subsidy with some Muslims objecting to it by claiming that the real beneficiary is Air India as the subsidy is actually a discount on an overpriced air fare.[3] There have also been requests by Muslims to withdraw subsidy including some Muslim Parliament members as it is against Islam even it was beneficial.[4]
Since 2000, over 1.5 million Muslims have used the subsidy; since 2008, over 120,000 Indian Muslim every year make use of the subsidy.[5] The Hajj subsidy includes an airfare subsidy as well as assistance to Muslim pilgrims for domestic travel to reach specially designed Haj departure airport terminals, meal, medical care and lodging assistance[6] provided by the Government of India.[7][8] The average airfare subsidy was about ₹73,526 (US$1,000) per Muslim pilgrim in 2008; while the average non-airfare financial assistance was ₹2,697 (US$38) per pilgrim.[5][6] The total subsidy provided by the Government of India was US$1,815 per Muslim pilgrim in 2008. In a Central Haj Committee meeting in November 2017, it was decided that Haj subsidy will be completely phased out in 2018 and funds will be utilised on educational programmes especially for girl children of the minority community. On 16 January 2018 Union minister for minority affairs said that the Hajj subsidy has been completely taken off (Rs 700crore) and this amount will be made used for educational purposes of the children belonging to minority.[9][10]
In May 2012, the Supreme Court of India bench, composed of Altamas Kabir and Ranjana Desai, ordered the government to end the practice by 2022.[11][12] "We direct the Central government to progressively reduce the amount of subsidy so as to completely eliminate it within a period of 10 years from today," said a bench of Justices Aftab Alam and Ranjana P Desai.[13] "The subsidy money may be more profitably used for uplift of the community in education and other indices of social development," said Justice Alam, who wrote the order. The court said it has no authority to speak on the minority community's behalf and that it would be presumptuous to tell the Muslims what was a good or bad religious practice even though it cited Quran to say that haj pilgrimage was mandatory only for those who could afford the expenses for traveling, food and accommodation.[13]
History [ edit ]
Pre-1947 British Raj era [ edit ]
The Haj subsidy traces its origins to the British colonial era. In 1932, the British colonial government enacted The Port Haj Committees Act, which provided for government funded Haj Committee and named Bombay and Calcutta as two embarkation points for Haj by Muslims in British India.[1] Along with Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937, the Haj Committees Act was one of a series of laws passed by the British colonial government to address Muslim demands in a riot torn, pre-partition South Asia.[1][14][15] The colonial government also granted a monopoly for sea-based Haj pilgrimage by South Asian Muslims to Mogul Line ships, owned by the British company Turner Morrison & Co. Ltd.
Post-colonial era [ edit ]
In 1959, Indian government repealed and replaced the 1932 Act, enacting Haj Committee Act, to establish a Committee in the Port of Bombay for assisting Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan and for matters connected therewith. The purpose of this Act was to manage all affairs of pilgrims like disseminating information, to negotiate travel arrangements, arranging guides, helping the needy and to address grievances of pilgrims. [2] Article 16 of the 1959 law also created a taxpayer financed Haj Fund to cover overhead expenses.[2]
From sea travel to air travel [ edit ]
The Haj subsidy was modified in 1973, when the Indian government abolished sea travel as a means of making the Hajj for two reasons - rising oil prices after formation of OPEC and a ship accident that killed 39 pilgrims in June 1973 during the government managed Haj trip.[16] The government of India replaced the means of travel to Saudi Arabia from ships to aircraft. The government simultaneously increased the subsidy to cover the difference between sea and air fares.[12]
Since 1994 the round trip cost to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia has been fixed at ₹12,000 (US$170) per pilgrim, and the government has footed the rest of the bill. In 2007 the government spent ₹47,454 (US$660) per passenger.[17] In the year 2009 the cost was ₹8.26 billion (US$110 million).[18][19]
Ministry of Civil Aviation provides subsidy for air travel to the pilgrims through the Haj Committee of India. The amount on air travel charged per pilgrim during Haj 2014 was Rs. 35,000/- whereas the actual air fare ranged from Rs. 63,750 to Rs. 1,63,350 depending on the embarkation point in India which were always higher than normal charges of air tickets. For Haj-2015, an amount of Rs. 42,000/- will be charged as airfare from each pilgrim performing Haj through HCOI. The subsidy amount extended was Rs.836.56 crores in 2012 to Rs. 680.03 crores in 2013. In 2014, it has further reduced to Rs. 533 crores.[21]
Supreme Court order to abolish Haj subsidy [ edit ]
In 2012, the Supreme Court of India ordered that Haj subsidy must end by 2022.[22] The Supreme Court found that Hajj by Indian Muslims is funded to a substantial extent by the Indian Government. The Court ruled that this subsidy is not only unconstitutional but inconsistent with the teachings of Quran. The Court cited Quran verse 97 in Surah 3, Al-e-Imran ordains as under: "In it is manifest signs (for example), the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham); whosoever enters it, they attain security. And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka'bah) is a duty that humankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one's conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then they are a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)."[22]
The Court directed the Central Government to progressively reduce the amount of Haj subsidy and abolish it by 2022. The Court, in its 2012 order, said the Centre should invest that amount in education and other development measures for the minority community.[23] also directed the Indian government to stop providing Hajj subsidies to Muslims identified by central government as very important person (VIP), very very important person (VVIP), and the special dignitaries and eminent persons nominations of 3,000 Muslims per year under so-called Goodwill Delegation to Saudi Arabia.[22]
In August 2010, the Minority Affairs Ministry formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme, was contrary to the teachings of Islam. The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely. (Instead, "a premium would be charged from better-off Hajis to cross-subsidise the travel cost for the less well-off Hajis".)[24]
The Centre had informed the Supreme Court that it had decided to restrict Haj pilgrimage at government subsidy to Muslims only as a "once in a lifetime" affair as against the existing policy of "once in five years". In an affidavit filed before the apex court, the government said the new guidelines have been framed to ensure that priority is given to those applicants who have never performed Haj. The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by the Centre challenging a Bombay high court judgement which had directed the Ministry of External Affairs to allow certain private operators to operate the services of 800 of the 11,000 pilgrims earmarked under the VIP quota subsidised by the government. Earlier, the bench had pulled up the Centre's practice of "politicising" the annual Haj pilgrimage by permitting official delegations to accompany the pilgrims, for which the government offers huge subsidy, saying, "It's a bad religious practice."
On 27 July 2012, the Supreme Court declined Centre's request to defer till next year its 23 July order downsizing the government's discretionary quota to 300 from the proposed 5,050 seats and had hoped these would be allotted on "reasonable basis".[25]
The subsidy had been reduced from Rs. 685 crore in 2011 to Rs 200 crore by 2017.[26] It was stopped by the government from 2018 onwards and will be used instead for education of Muslim girls. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi confirmed it had been withdrawn.[27]
Criticism [ edit ]
Considerable criticism has been levelled against this practice, both by Hindu organisations opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups. As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidised fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare.[28] However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large. Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, have resulted partly from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control. They suggest charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey.[29] Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority.[29] one of India's most Renowned Islamic Scholars, Dr. Zafarul Islam Khan states that,"Muslims, in general, are not in favour of the Hajj subsidy. We consider the subsidy as a subsidy to Air India and not to the Muslim community."[12]
Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Delhi's Jama Masjid mosque, said a decade was far too long for the subsidy to be phased out. "It should be done away with within a year," they told reporters. Salman Khurshid, minister for minority affairs and a member of the Congress party, which heads the coalition government, expressed no surprise about the court's decision, telling reporters that discussions to "roll back the Haj subsidy" had been underway for four years. Asaduddin Owaisi, a member of parliament from the city of Hyderabad said, this amount of subsidy is to simply being a subsidy for Air India. Ticket prices would be far lower, they said yesterday, if Air India's monopoly were broken and pilgrims simply bought their own, unsubsidised tickets on other airlines.[30]
Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-Islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead. Maulana Mahmood A. Madani, a member of the Rajya Sabha and general secretary of the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic Sharia, since the Koran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources.[31] Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is UnIslamic.[32] Praveen Togadia of Vishwa Hindu Parishad has argued that the government sponsored Haj subsidy is provided from taxes of Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and demanded that it be abolished or similar grants be extended to Hindus.[33]
A New York-based food service company that oversees concessions at Boston's TD Garden and Minneapolis' Target Field, among other places, will no longer purchase lobster from Linda Bean's Maine Lobster, a well-known processor.
The decision by Delaware North Companies Sportservice of Buffalo, New York, was made after the animal rights group PETA released secret video footage last September of lobsters and other crustaceans being processed at the Rockland facility.
That video, taken undercover by a PETA investigator who worked briefly at Linda Bean's Maine Lobster, shows, among other things, live lobsters being ripped apart by hand.
PETA – which stands for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals – claimed the processing method shown was cruel and inhumane.
Wendy Watkins, vice president of corporate communications for Delaware North Companies, confirmed Tuesday that the company is no longer doing business with the Maine company but did not address the PETA video.
“Delaware North has a longstanding commitment to sustainable and responsible practices in food purchasing, and we do our best to maintain very high standards with our vendors,” they said in an email.
PETA praised the firm for dropping Linda Bean's Maine Lobster.
“Smart companies know that consumers object to the unnecessary suffering of animals killed for food, so Bean should be prepared to lose even more customers as word gets out,” PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said in a statement.
Linda Bean is a granddaughter of the legendary Maine retailer L.L. Bean and a major player in the state's lobster industry. In addition to the processing facility, they own restaurants in Freeport, South Portland and Port Clyde.
Bean's attorney, Stephen Hayes, said Tuesday they couldn't comment on Delaware North Companies' decision or its effect on business.
When the PETA video was released last year, Hayes defended the company's processing practices.
“Our practices do not violate Maine's laws on cruelty to animals because lobsters do not come within the covered definition,” they said in an email.
“Simply put, lobsters are not ‘sentient creatures,' a position supported by long-standing and oft-repeated scientific and governmental studies.”
Maine's top fisheries official and others in the industry also defended the Rockland processor.
The research on whether crustaceans feel pain is inconclusive. Some European researchers cited by PETA have found that lobsters exhibit behavior consistent with response to painful stimuli.
PETA said it repeatedly approached Bean's company before releasing the video to discuss “alternative slaughtering methods,” but was unsuccessful.
The group said humane ways to kill lobsters include stunning them, which kills any nerves and any ability to feel pain.
A less common method is “high-pressure processing,” which kills and cooks lobsters in seconds, but it's expensive.
PETA had asked the Knox County District Attorney's Office to charge Linda Bean's Maine Lobster with animal cruelty, but DA Geoffrey Rushlau declined.
Linda Bean's Maine Lobster is among more than a dozen processors licensed by the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Collectively, they process 10 million to 12 million pounds of lobster a year, or about 10 percent of the state's catch.

Banks have reduced the time it takes customers to switch current-account providers. It's a well-known saying that customer-bank relationships last longer than most marriages. But what are the other really long relationships?
More than 50% of all UK current-account holders have never switched their account, according to market research firm Mintel.
The average current-account relationship lasts 17 years, while the average British marriage which ends in divorce lasts just 11 years and six months.
But the stats don't signify a happy relationship. Nearly half of current-account holders stay put because they perceive switching to be too much of a hassle, according to uSwitch. On Monday, the banking industry said the time customers would have to wait to switch current accounts would be slashed from 30 days to just seven.
But what's going on with these long-term customer relationships?
Hairdressers

Some people tell their hairdresser more than they'd tell their family. And there are those who would travel further for them and on a more regular basis.
It's been reported that a loyalty survey of 2,000 adults found hairdressers are the businesses that customers are most loyal to, with two-thirds of consumers stating that they would continue to go to the same hairdressers, without even thinking of switching to another salon.
"With hairdressers there is a risk of uncertainty and risk when people go to someone new," says consumer psychologist Philip Graves. "They've got to describe how they want their hair cut, and they probably don't know how to do that technically. On the other hand, with someone familiar it feels comforting."
The trauma of ending a relationship with a hairdresser has been well documented. Both the Chicago Tribune and Huffington Post have blogged on the subject.
Dentists
Many people hate going to the dentist, but when they do, it's better the devil they know.

A survey by dentistry firm Oasis found that 43% of people were loyal to their current dentist, saying they would not change unless they really had to. It found that 22% had never changed dentist, with 60% having been with their dentist for five years or more.
Across the other side of the world in Australia, the bond's even longer, lasting nine years on average.
However, there is evidence the patient-dentist relationship is not as strong as it once was, with a generational spilt emerging.
Only 35% of 16-24-year-olds identify themselves as "loyal" to their dentist, compared with 56% of 55-64-year-olds, according to Oasis.
There's also a geographical divide with 28% of patients saying they would "shop around" for different prices across the UK, rising to 40% in London.
Mobile phones

Nearly 25% of consumers have never changed their mobile network provider, according to Mintel.
But Graves thinks network providers have an advantage when it comes to technology.
"With mobile phone contracts there is the carrot of a new handset, which is an attractive way of tempting people over.
"There can also be an immediate lower cost to line rental, whereas with something like an electricity bill, it's harder psychologically as there's no tangible cost benefit. Most people aren't able to think, 'We'll make the switch now and be £100 better off in a year' and feel better. There is no instant gratification," they say.
Energy suppliers
About 95% of energy customers are aware they can switch suppliers, but only 38% have ever done so, according to uSwitch.

Moneysupermarket.com estimates the figure to be even higher. "About 70% of people have never switched, and if they are on a standard deal, they could save about £200 by doing so," says Kevin Mountford, head of banking at the website.
For Graves, it's a question of not seeing the benefits.
Unless people do clever accounting, or put money away that they would be spending on energy every month, it's hard to imagine the savings.
"And let's face it, who is going to do that, and who would want to spend time at a party with someone like that?" they say.
Gym memberships

Gym memberships are another relationship that seem to stand the test of time - not least as many signs up to long-term deals.
Mountford says the problem is people with the best of intentions often end up throwing money away.
"People wouldn't go to the supermarket and spend £40 without actually getting anything, so people shouldn't do it in gyms.
"If people want to take control of their finances, it might be better to go to a council-run gym once or twice a month rather than a super-gym," they say.

While some people might question the rationale of not shopping around, Graves says it's an entirely rational pattern of human behaviour.
"Engaging with something requires us to use cognitive resources, and they are limited.
"People tend to give things attention when they decide they are going to get a psychological return from it. For some people, changing bank accounts might feel like a big thing to do - something that involves a lot of learning for not much reward. They'd rather spend two days looking around at a new pair of mountain bike socks, or whatever hobby they have," they say.
Loss aversion also comes into play, according to Graves. "In evolution terms, we avoid doing things that are risky, that would lead to our demise. Of course we don't live in an age where these decisions are likely to affect our existence, but that instinct is still there.
"So with banks, on one hand it might show that only 1% of people who move accounts have a problem. On a human level, we are likely to think of potential disruption - such as if rent doesn't come out on time there might be grief from a landlord," they say.
Gun background checks have jumped 41 percent over the past year in New Jersey, an indication that gun sales are rising again after falling for the last few years.
State residents who have firearms permits started the process of purchasing a gun more than 10,000 times in October 2016, up from roughly 7,000 times in October 2015, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Overall, gun checks in New Jersey have increased since 1998, when the FBI began running residents through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The number of background checks has increased from 39,000 in 2000 to 70,000 in 2015.
Gun checks had previously reached a peak in mid-2013, when legislators discussed increasing gun regulation after the Newtown, Conn. mass shooting. The recent rise came soon after the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015, which broke national records for most gun checks in a single day and week.
Then President Barack Obama announced their support for expanded background checks, followed by reports of increased permit applications and gun sales from police departments and firearm dealerships.
"It's true certain events can lead to an uptick in gun sales," said Eric Ruben, a jurisprudence fellow at the Brennen Center for Justice, part of New York University's School of Law.
They said the rise in background checks could be related to the amount of rhetoric in this election about what would happen to gun rights if either candidate wins.
"Gun rights advocates have been saying it will be a doomsday scenario for gun rights if Clinton is elected," they said.
Any purchase from a licensed firearm dealer must first be run through the FBI's system to check the criminal background of the customer. However, a background check does not always lead to a sale, and private gun sales have no such requirement, though they account for up to 40 percent of actual gun sales.
The data also doesn't reveal who is purchasing guns, and how many. Research has shown that 3 percent of Americans own half of all guns.

Shortly after 3am local time, prominent Bahraini blogger Mahmood al-Yousif was arrested in their home. Before leaving with police officers, the blogger tweeted:
Police here for me
Al-Yousif is an influential blogger whose writings of late have been in favor of unifying Bahrainis. On March 15, they wrote:
[I] choose to come back [to Bahrain] to continue to espouse sanity and tolerance. To continue to try to show people that regardless of their beliefs, status or wealth, our destinies as Bahrainis are intertwined and it behoves us to find equitable ways to live together and ameliorate our differences. I don't want to point fingers nor am interested in apportioning further blame. I favor the recognition of the root causes of this strife in order to move on, no matter how painful that exercise may be.
Al-Yousif has long been the administrator of a site called JustBahraini, a unity campaign against sectarianism. They wrote recently of a campaign supporter being threatened by police.
Their arrest was confirmed by their brother, as well as their son, who tweeted:
Police just came to my house and arrested my father, Mahmood Al-Yousif. @BahrainRights @OnlineBahrain

Drones accounted for a third of all civilian deaths in air strikes. (Photo: Defence Images)
Civilian drone deaths in Afghanistan tripled last year, according to a report by a UN agency. Forty-five civilians died in drone strikes in 2013.
The report, by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama), found that drone strikes accounted for at least a third of all civilian deaths in air strikes last year. Unama notes that it is sometimes difficult to establish which type of aircraft carried out a strike, so the true total could be higher.
The UK and US are the only countries to operate armed drones in the conflict. A December 2012 report by the Bureau found that the two forces had carried out over 1,000 drone strikes in the country in the previous five years. British drones have carried out over a fifth of all these strikes, despite having a much smaller fleet.
Related story – Revealed: US and Britain launched 1,200 drone strikes in recent wars
Unama identifies 19 separate incidents in which civilians were killed. It raises concerns about ‘possible negligence' by international troops over a drone strike on September 7 2013 in which local officials immediately claimed civilians had died. The governor of Kunar province, where the attack took place, told Reuters: ‘Four women, four children, two drivers, a merchant and three suspected (insurgents) were killed.'
‘The apparent failure of international forces to identify the presence of a group of women and children… could suggest negligence'
– Unama report
‘During Unama's initial meetings with Isaf on the incident Isaf denied the possibility of civilian casualties,' the report notes. Isaf claimed a senior insurgent had probably been killed and the dead were ‘insurgents', although it did not identify them.
‘After multiple meetings in which Unama called for a review of the incident, Isaf confirmed two civilian deaths “one female and one child” and “would not rule out the possibility of another woman's death,' Unama's report adds.
Unama conducted over 50 interviews with relatives of victims, community representatives, and Afghan and Isaf officials, and found that the attack killed 10 civilians and seriously injured a four-year-old girl. It notes that Isaf has not published the results of any investigation into the incident or indicated any change in its targeting policies.
‘The apparent failure… of international forces to identify the presence of a group of women and children in a vehicle prior to engaging the vehicle with a UAV/RPA [drone] strike could suggest negligence,' Unama notes. ‘Of further concern, was the apparent failure of international military forces to confirm the identity and/or status of the men accompanying the fighter targeted by international military forces.'
Isaf spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Will Griffin told the Bureau that after Isaf investigated, it ‘acknowledged responsibility for at least three civilian casualties'.
‘We certainly respect the work that Unama does in this regard and agree that any civilian casualty is one too many'
– Isaf spokesperson
They added: ‘Isaf identified a target individual in a vehicle and followed them to an area remote from villages and apparent civilians. In spite of persistent observation, unknown to ISAF there were at least three civilians located in the vehicle with the target. Although ISAF's engagement was successful against the insurgent target, regrettably the strike resulted in three other casualties. One of these was a four-year-old child, for whom ISAF took responsibility for sending to the US for advanced medical treatment.'
Asked about the disparity between Isaf's casualty count and Unama's, they pointed to ‘variance between the sources and methodolgies used by Isaf and Unama to verify information'. They added: ‘We certainly respect the work that Unama does in this regard and agree that any civilian casualty is one too many.'
Unama does not state which force operated the drone. A Los Angeles Times report on the strike, published in December 2013, mentioned discussions with US officials about the strike. Philip Hammond, the British defence minister, wrote in the Guardian in December 2013 that only one attack by a British drone has killed civilians – a March 2011 attack, in which four farmers were killed.
Related story – A changing drone campaign: US covert actions in 2013
The numbers killed in air strikes represented a tiny fraction of the overall violence captured in Unama's report. After a decline in civilian deaths in 2012, last year they rose again to approach 2011's record highs. Nearly 3,000 non-combatants were killed, including 1,300 women and children.
Three quarters of the deaths were caused by the Taliban and other insurgents, with improvised explosive devices alone killing almost 1,000 civilians. International air operations represented 2% of all civilian deaths, and declined by 10% compared to 2012.
The rising civilian toll in drone strikes is in stark contrast to the CIA's operations over the border in Pakistan, where the Bureau has found drones killed a maximum of four civilians in the year's 27 drone operations. However civilian casualties also rose in US drone operations in Yemen, where at least six civilians were killed in a US military strike that reportedly attacked a wedding procession.

Hamza Kashgari, a Saudi Arabian 23-year-old, has the unpleasant distinction of being the first person facing state execution over Tweets.
Is their situation thanks, in part, to Interpol?
After posting a series of Tweets about the Prophet Muhammed -- "I will say that I have loved aspects of you, hated others, and could not understand many more" reads one message -- Hamza faced a public uproar and fled their home.
They were caught in Malaysia and was likely en route to New Zealand where, according to Al-Jazeera, they hoped to secure asylum.
They may be executed. Clerics have called for Hamza's killing in Saudi Arabia, where apostasy is punishable by death.
But is their predicament has drawn attention to the reported role of Interpol, used by the world's police agencies to share information and nab country-hopping fugitives.
Malaysian police tell Reuters they extradited the Saudi Tweeter after viewing an Interpol notice.
But Interpol tells the UK's Guardian newspaper this: "The assertion that Saudi Arabia used Interpol's system in this case is wholly misleading and erroneous."
No matter the truth, Interpol will seek distance from this case's messy tangle of religious and free-speech conflicts. And Malaysian authorities, despite the criticism they've faced for quickly extraditing the Saudi, are likely glad to be rid of him. Though blasphemy isn't a capital offense in Malaysia, the Muslim-majority country is home to plenty of voters who are unlikely to see Hamza as a sympathetic figure.
Social media's role in this case doesn't end with Twitter: fury over Hamza's Tweets was ramped up in large part by a Facebook group demanding their execution.
Al-Jazeera has a screen shot here.
I love the knife life
Here's the thing: If I ever have to eat you, this would be the knife I'd use.
Oh, don't get me wrong: I'm not threatening you or anything. I consider you a dear friend! But if tragedy were to strike and we were to become stranded in a forest in a blizzard or something, I could use either of this knife to gut and clean your corpse. I mean, I wouldn't enjoy such a thing; I would only do it if it were a matter of life and death and I had to eat your flesh to survive. I would ask your blessing in your final moments, but to be honest it wouldn't really matter once you were gone, right? You're not using it any more.
Look, if you can take any comfort in this, just know that the knife's innovative design would provide me with a secure grip while I worked the meat away from your bones. And the drop point blade will make cutting easier and give me superior penetrating power. I won't expend much precious energy harvesting much-needed calories.
What do you mean, "what if I die first?" In that case, you'd have to get your own friggin' knife.

If you've been working in Japan for a while and following all the money-saving advice on this site, by now you've probably built up a pile of cash. While you could spend your stash on a gold-laced cocktail at the Mandarin Oriental, you might want to consider sending it home, or to a country that doesn't have negative interest rates. So what are your options to transfer money out of Japan?
tl;dr: Likely the cheapest and easiest (but not necessarily fastest) method for transferring your yen out of Japan is Likely the cheapest and easiest (but not necessarily fastest) method for transferring your yen out of Japan is TransferWise
N.B. If you want to transfer money to Japan, see our article on transferring money to Japan.
Bank transfers
Japan is renowned for its stable banking system, but that's because the banks haven't changed the way they do business in 20 years. A simple international transfer will typically involve you filling out an overly detailed form at the branch, getting charged up to 4,000 yen just for the transfer, and then getting shafted with horrible exchange rates. Unless you're set on being a martyr to the Japanese banking system, our advice is to avoid this option.
TransferWise
TransferWise have been around since 2011, but they've only fairly recently set up in Japan. They allow you to transfer your funds to a local bank account before they get whisked overseas. The main benefit of TransferWise is they don't make money on the exchange rate, and they try to make the whole procedure as smooth and painless as possible.
The cost structure is this: You pay a fixed fee, plus a percentage of the total amount. What you pay depends on which currencies you're using, but it's very reasonable for most of the major ones. The exchange rates (when we checked) were almost identical to those on exchange rate reference site xe.com, which lists mid-market rates.
How to use TransferWise
To transfer, you go to their site and put in the amount that you want to send (in either the source or target currency), then you enter your details. You'll be asked to upload photos of either your “My Number” notification (that's the plain piece of paper) or your My Number photo ID. If you have the photo ID, that's all you need to upload; if not, you'll need to upload a scan or pic of some other photo ID, such as a Japanese driver's license or a foreign resident's card.
Once you've uploaded your docs, you'll get a confirmation screen with the details of your transaction. After you agree to this, you'll get information of a local account at Mitsubishi Tokyo UFJ to transfer the total amount to. You can go ahead and make the transfer. (Note that if you've signed up for a new account, the transaction won't go through until your documents have been checked off, and you may be asked to post in a few things.) You can download the app for easy transactions going forward.
TransferWise gives you an estimate of when the money will arrive in the destination bank account—approximately four days, usually. But with our test transfer, the funds arrived in just two days.
The following was calculated using the transfer calculator on the site on February 25, 2019. For the sake of comparison, we chose a transfer to USD.
*We deducted the fee from the starting amount for this and all calculations below.
JPY Amount 10,000 100,000 Fee (JPY) 276 849 Rate (JPY->USD) 0.00904 USD Amount 87.90 896.33 Rank 1 1 Rates on February 25, 2019
Nice extra: TransferWise recently added a borderless account to their services. It's basically an international bank account, minus the fees. You can read more about the borderless account here. Note, however, that if you're resident in Japan, you may not be able to set one up.
GoRemit
GoRemit is the crusty incumbent to TransferWise's feisty challenger (GoRemit has been at this for more than 15 years—they were formerly GoLloyds). The process is basically the same, but the fee structure is slightly different. While the exchange rates are more or less the same, the handling fee is fixed at a flat 2,000 yen. This means for amounts under 200,000 yen, it works out more expensive than TransferWise. For amounts over 200,000 yen it starts becoming more competitive.
GoRemit sign-up takes place offline—so you'll need to fill out forms and send copies of ID documents by post. However, they did recently launch an app to make things easier once you're all set up.
JPY Amount 10,000 100,000 Fee (JPY) 2,000 2,000 Rate (USD->JPY) 111.80 USD Amount 71.56 876.57 Rank 4 2 Rates on February 25, 2019
Seven Bank
Seven Bank offers a service in conjunction with Western Union. While you could just use Western Union without using Seven Bank, the integration with the bank account makes things a bit smoother. The fee you pay increases with the amount you send.
JPY Amount 10,000 100,000 Fee (JPY) 990 2,000 Rate (JPY->USD) 0.00870 USD Amount 78.40 852.78 Rank 3 4 Rates on February 25, 2019
PayPal
PayPal is by far the most opaque of the money-sending services. Depending on the currency pair, there may be a conversion charge of between 0.5% and 4%.
While easy to use once it's set up, getting money into your account from your bank can take a little while. Also, there may be restrictions on the receiving end. Depending on the country, the recipient may not be able to receive the cash you are sending. Apparently, measures like these are to stop money laundering and terrorism. As you may have noticed, both of these activities are flourishing, so I guess they got that one wrong.
The calculation below is based on a 0.5% currency conversion charge. This may vary quite a bit on your own account.
JPY Amount 10,000 100,000 Fee (JPY) 50 500 Rate (JPY->USD) 0.00870 USD Amount 86.57 865.65 Rank 2 3 Rates on February 25, 2019
Our recommendations to transfer money out of Japan
Small to medium amounts
For small amounts and even amounts into the hundreds of thousands of yen, TransferWise generally appears to be the best-value option. For amounts over 200,000 yen, GoRemit might start to make more sense than TransferWise. Note that TransferWise is limited to amounts of no more than 1,000,000 yen. PayPal is also relatively good for small amounts of money, even though the exchange rate is often fairly poor.
Larger amounts
For large transfers of yen outside Japan, GoRemit or, provided you are not a long-term resident of Japan, possibly OFX are the best options, as their usage charges do not vary.
Choice of currencies
TransferWise and Seven Bank win out in terms of the number of currencies available. GoRemit is limited to 11 foreign currencies: USD, CAD, GBP, EUR, AUD, NZD, CHF, HKD, SGD, SEK and INR. PayPal can handle up to 23 currencies (with some conditions attached).
Ease of use
TransferWise is probably the best when it comes to ease of set-up and use. Once set up, they are all relatively easy to use, though.

China's rapid strides in digital technologies have indirectly inspired India to digitise its economy, TCS' Asia-Pacific president has said.
In mobile payments and artificial intelligence, China is already leading and has shared its expertise with its neighbours, Girish Ramachandran said.
The Belt and Road Initiative will help China bring some of its world-class technologies to economies along the trading routes, they said.
“The initiative is a great opportunity for global trade, and to build connectivity,” Ramachandran has been quoted as saying by state-run China Daily today.
Chinese technologies are making inroads in India, exemplified by the export of Ant Financial Services Group's wireless payment solutions to Paytm.
The two signed an agreement in 2015 to create an Alipay clone in India.
India, like China, does not have an entrenched credit card culture. So with the right technologies and business models, jumping from cash to mobile payment is not difficult, they said.
Today, Paytm covers 150 million users in India and enables people to complete a variety of purchases and access micro loans with a scan of their phones, they said.
“The demonetisation accords with the Indian government's push to combat the black market, increase transparency and digitise the economy. Clearly China has played a significant role in this,” they said.
From the all-in-one app WeChat, to some of the nascent artificial intelligence start-ups, Ramachandran said China has exhibited huge potential in the global high-tech race.
It is now time for China to properly brand these technologies and make them available overseas.
“Most of the apps, technologies and services are being used in China only. Turning them into world-renowned brands would pave the way for China's next phase of growth,” they said, adding that the Belt and Road Initiative would certainly drive that goal.
China's high-tech giants have already entered the South Asian market.
Tencent Cloud, the cloud business division of Tencent Holdings Limited, has established overseas services nodes in India and a data center in Singapore to provide “secure and cost efficient” IT infrastructure, the Daily report said.
UCWeb Inc, a subsidiary of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, announced the launch of a We-Media Reward Plan 2.0 in India to encourage and sponsor self-publishers and content distribution through the internet, it said.

This past summer, John K. Bush was confirmed as a federal judge on the Court of the Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, over cries of protest from progressive groups. Bush, who was nominated to the position by President Trump, once spoke publicly in front of a crowd and used the word “faggot,” quoting Hunter S. Thompson, without appearing to be uncomfortable with the slur. They also argued in a paper that the Kentucky Supreme Court had become “overly aggressive,” citing as evidence the fact that the Court had “immunized consensual sodomy from criminal prosecution.”
Serving alongside Bush is Joan Larsen, another newly installed circuit judge. In 2016, when they held a seat on the Michigan Supreme Court, she, too, expressed hostility toward LGBT people when they refused to hear a case on same-sex parental rights, and suggested gay families were “lesser” than heterosexual ones.
Bush and Larsen are just two of the 16 Trump judicial nominees that have been fiercely opposed by Lambda Legal, an organization advocating for the legal rights of LGBTQ people. According to new analysis the group released this week, nearly one-third of the president's nominees so far have records that suggest they would not uphold the rights of LGBT people. They range from those who “have openly denigrated LGBT people and families” to others who “have more quietly undermined LGBT rights and protections,” the report's authors write.
To date, Trump has nominated 59 judicial nominees, including Neil Gorsuch (who's now on the US Supreme Court), Gregory Katsas (who's now serving on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit), and Amy Coney Barrett (who took the bench on the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit). All three were opposed by Lambda Legal for their anti-LGBT records.
“We are in the midst of a judicial crisis for LGBT Americans, spurred by Donald Trump's full-on assault on our rights, our families, and our children,” said Sharon McGowan, the director of strategy at Lambda Legal, in a statement. “Over the last year, we've seen Trump nominate judges who are unqualified and hostile to our community—they have used slurs like ‘faggot' in public addresses, have called our children a part of ‘Satan's plan,' and have even targeted a transgender teenager on Twitter for public ridicule and mockery.”
"We are in the midst of a judicial crisis for LGBT Americans, spurred by Donald Trump's full-on assault on our rights, our families, and our children."
Because of the influence the federal courts have in interpreting the country's laws, the people filling these positions will directly impact the lives of all Americans. It's because of litigation fought on the federal level—such as the groundbreaking civil rights case of Obergefell v. Hodges, which gave same-sex couples the right to marry—that the LGBTQ community is able to access many of the same rights straight people have.
This week's report also highlights the sheer speed in which the administration has moved to fill the more than 120 federal judicial vacancies. So far, 18 judges have been confirmed, 12 at the circuit court level and six in US District Court. “By comparison,” the authors point out, “at this time in their administrations, President Barack Obama had confirmed three circuit court judges, President George W. Bush had confirmed five circuit court judges, and President Bill Clinton had confirmed three circuit court judges. In other words, Trump has confirmed more circuit court judges than all three prior presidents combined, at the same time of their presidency.”
In fact, three of the most recent judicial nominees were confirmed just last week: Leonard Steven Grasz to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and Don Willett and James Ho to the Fifth Circuit. All were opposed by Lambda Legal. Lambda Legal argued that Justice Willett, for example, would not offer a fair hearing to LGBT people because they trivialized the importance of marriage equality. (In 2015, the day after same-sex marriage was legalized, they tweeted: “I could support recognizing a constitutional right to marry bacon.” The tweet has since been deleted; they told the Senate Judiciary Committee that they meant it as a joke.)
What's perhaps most frightening about the impact of these judgeships is that many of them are lifetime appointments. As McGowan pointed out in their statement, “each of these confirmed judges will outlast this administration and have the potential to decimate civil rights in the Trump's vision for generations to come.”
But Kaepernick has also pledged to give away a million dollars – $100,000 per month – to a variety of smaller organizations dedicated to helping oppressed communities. Some of these organizations don't have the national presence of, say, Planned Parenthood or the ACLU, but they're taking on the same problems at a smaller scale.
Most recently, Kaepernick donated $25,000 to a cause we've written about before, an urban farming and food-education nonprofit in Minneapolis called Appetite for Change. (You might recall an unexpectedly catchy song called “Grow Food” that Appetite for Change released last year.) Appetite for Change is a multi-layered organization; its goals are to encourage healthy eating and community growth in North Minneapolis, an area so bereft of decent food options that it's classified as a “food desert.”
The organization maintains large plots of farmland, as well as education and activities for locals, right in the city, in addition to various other efforts in advocacy and outreach. In addition to doing great work, Appetite for Change is media-savvy, but it's still a small, regional effort, which can make it hard to attract major donors.
“We were thinking about our capital campaign and who we can reach out to, and as we were pooling our resources, a few of us were saying who we knew, and we knew a few football players and football players' agents,” says Princess Titus, the director of education and training for Appetite for Change. “I was on vacation, and when I came back, they were like, Colin Kaepernick said yes, he's giving us $25,000.”
Kaepernick, says Titus, was very knowledgeable about Appetite for Change, what the organization does and what it needs, and wanted to make sure their donation would be used in the right ways. “Our goals were to find more garden space and expand our gardens so they can really be farms,” says Titus. “We need composting on them, we need rain barrels, we have to pay for the water from the city of Minneapolis, we have to run hoses underground down the block to the fire hydrants, and that's a big financial burden.”
Luckily, Kaepernick seemed to know just what to give. “The things that they actually offered the dollars for were things that we really needed,” says Titus. Their donations will go to purchasing a new plot of land – currently, Appetite for Change either rents or borrows land, rather than owning – as well as organizational stuff like increasing staff and developing new programs.
The press (oh, hello) that comes from a celebrity donation like this one is also valuable beyond merely the dollar amount; more people will become aware of Appetite for Change, and what they do, than if anyone else had made the same donation. It's a gift that, Titus hopes, will keep on giving.
Worldwide, an estimated $574 billion (USD) was sent by migrants to relatives in their home countries in 2016, a 1% decline from 2015, when the amount was $581 billion, according to economists at the World Bank. This is the second drop in global remittances since the global financial crisis. Despite this recent decline, remittances sent by migrants are still about double what they were a decade ago, before the sharp decline in the global economy during the late 2000s.
Tracking remittances worldwide is difficult because many countries do not track funds that are sent or received. Based on data it is able to collect, the World Bank has used a statistical model to estimate the amount of money coming from each sending country to each receiving country. Because these numbers are estimates, there is some room for error. For example, the total incoming or outgoing remittances for some countries may not be the same as actual remittances.
Analysis:
Microsoft's Surface Pro tablet is set to go on sale in late January. After unveiling the pricing for its Windows 8 tablet late last year, Microsoft has remained relatively quiet about the exact timing of release outside of a promised January timeframe. Calls made to several Microsoft retail stores by CNET reveal that employees expect its latest tablet at the end of the month. Our own sources have confirmed to The Verge that the Surface Pro will be released in late January, despite rumors of a CES timeframe.
Priced from $899, the Surface Pro includes an Intel Core i5 processor and 1080p HD display. The Pro will run a full version of Windows 8, unlike the Surface RT running on Windows RT. Microsoft originally opened up pre-orders for its Surface RT tablet 10 days ahead of its release on October 26th. If the company is following a similar pattern of pre-orders then we'll likely see an announcement shortly after CES. The software maker previously announced its plans to scale down its presence at CES 2013, with no booth on the show floor or a Microsoft-led keynote — a sign that the company wants to manage its own products and announcements separately from the industry trade show.
“I Don't Think A Lot Of People Will Be Happy”: Former Top DOJ Official Hints IG Report Might Be A Doozy For Hillary Clinton
Thanks to the soon-to-be released Justice Inspector General report, Hillary Clinton may find themselves in MORE hot water if political bias is found to have played a role in the email investigation's findings, says former Justice Department official Michael Bromwich.
USA Today reports:
Former Justice inspector general Michael Bromwich said that the office has a long established record as “a reliable and independent voice” that has held some of the most powerful institutions to account. The disclosures of the agents' text messages, they said, “has certainly re-focused the spotlight on investigation that many people may have forgotten about but remains an important piece of work that needs to be completed.” More than once, Bromwich found themselves at the center of a firestorm while inspector general. In 1997, Bromwich authored a damning review of the FBI's crime laboratory on the eve of the federal trial of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. While McVeigh was ultimately convicted and executed, the lab had been heavily involved in examining evidence in that case. “Michael (Horowitz) is a very solid guy with exactly the right background for the job. It's a job that doesn't make you many friends,” Bromwich said. “And I don't think a lot of people will be happy when it's over. But I think they are going to call it as they see it.”
Unsure who Horowitz is? Here's the latest on the Inspector General:
In a recent letter sent to Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ron Johnson (R-WI), Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz revealed details about the discovery of the anti-Trump texts.
Daily Caller reports:
Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department watchdog, said that their office obtained the text messages from the FBI on July 20. A week later, they met with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to inform them of the politically-charged texts. […] Horowitz, writing to Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, said that their office obtained the Strzok texts after asking the FBI to produce communications from bureau-issued phones for a select group of employees who worked on the Clinton email probe. […]
“After finding a number of politically-oriented text messages between Page and Strzok, the OIG sought from the FBI all text messages between Strzok and Page from their FBI-issued phones through November 30, 2016, which covered the entire period of the Clinton e-mail server investigation,” Horowitz revealed to both Grassley and Johnson.
Below is a photo of Horowitz.

This month, Fox News published a portion of the approximately 10,000 texts messages sent between FBI agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page. Among the messages is an exchange revealing Strzok and Page discussed an ‘insurance policy,' against a Trump presidency.
Strzok, who was fired from Mueller's Russia probe after reports revealed the disgraced law enforcement officer sent ‘anti-Trump,' texts to a colleague, personally changed key language that former Bureau Director James Comey used to describe Hillary Clinton's email conduct.
CNN reports:
A former top counterintelligence expert at the FBI, now at the center of a political uproar for exchanging private messages that appeared to mock President Donald Trump, changed a key phrase in former FBI Director James Comey's description of how former secretary of state Hillary Clinton handled classified information, according to US officials familiar with the matter. Electronic records show Peter Strzok, who led the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server as the No. 2 official in the counterintelligence division, changed Comey's earlier draft language describing Clinton's actions as “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless,” the source said. The drafting process was a team effort, CNN is told, with a handful of people reviewing the language as edits were made, according to another US official familiar with the matter.

Grassley apparently referred to a report that Sergey Kislyak had spoken to then-Alabama Sen. Sessions on Trump campaign issues, according to Kislayk's accounts of the conversations to Russian officials which were intercepted by U.S. spy agencies.

The intelligence was leaked to The Washington Post by a former U.S. intelligence official, who also said the conversations included talks of what U.S.-Russia relations might look like under a Trump administration.
Trump blasted The Washington Post article on Saturday, calling the leaks "illegal."
The reported conversations add to speculation about alleged collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia while Moscow was actively trying to influence the election.
Sessions originally failed to disclose a meeting with Kislyak, and then said that their conversations had nothing to do with the Trump campaign.
Less than two years ago, Rand Paul and the Koch brothers were poised to take libertarianism to the next level. Today, they're even further back than where they started.
Back in the summer of 2014, the New York Times Magazine ran a cover story on Sen. Rand Paul, asking in the title, “Has the libertarian moment finally arrived?” In it, writer Robert Draper catalogued the many ways in which Paul and libertarian activists were strategizing to broaden the political appeal of libertarian ideas throughout the country. The article teased at a future where the Republican Party didn't just talk a big game about making government smaller and increasing freedom, but actually made it the fundamental objective of the party.

For a little while, it looked like that dream might come true. From early 2014 to mid-2015, Rand Paul was the ascendant outsider Republican. In July of 2014, they were leading the presidential polls in Iowa (albeit with just 11 percent support) and even led in the national polls as recently as June of this year (again with just 11 percent support). Paul was by no means the sole front-runner, but pundits of all political stripes were lauding their chances of building a sizable coalition of young independents and Tea Party-affiliated voters to make a credible run at the presidency.
But today, just six months after those highs, Rand Paul's bid to bring libertarianism into the political mainstream looks like it has failed completely. Today, Rand Paul routinely garners just 2 percent in the polls, and when compared to the relative success of their father, Ron Paul—who finished second place in the 2012 New Hampshire Republican primary—it looks like American libertarianism has receded to a level of political power not seen since George W. Bush was president.
What went wrong for Rand Paul and for libertarians in general? And why is it that the Republican Party—which seems like such a natural fit for libertarian beliefs—never seems to follow through on its promises of smaller government and greater liberty?
To answer that question, we need to start by giving libertarianism some credit. It's a political philosophy with deep and long-standing roots in American political culture, and it's not going away any time soon. Americans love freedom, and libertarians advocate for the most of it. It's just that when it comes to Social Security, healthcare for the poor, or universal access to military-grade assault rifles, most people start thinking of freedom in a slightly different way.
But the rise of the Tea Party following Barack Obama's election in 2008 made it seem like libertarianism was on the verge of something bigger. Rand Paul themselves swept into office in the Republican wave of 2010, and the Edward Snowden revelations, the passage of Obamacare, and a new torrent of federal regulation brought renewed vigor to the libertarian movement. Even in the elections in 2012 and 2013, you got the sense something was afoot. Libertarian candidates across the country were getting 6 percent-7 percent of the vote and throwing statewide contests (for example, a Senate race in Montana and the governor's race in Virginia) largely to the Democrats.
If the political grass roots were primed for the rise of Rand Paul, the money and organization were even better. With hundreds of millions of dollars pledged to support libertarian causes, the Koch brothers continue to provide unprecedented amounts of cash and logistical support to bring the ideology of minimal government to the forefront of political action. Their organizations—Americans for Prosperity, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and countless others—have employed an array of carrots and sticks to move the Republican Party toward a more libertarian agenda.

And even if you weren't high on Rand Paul or the Koch brothers, there was still one more major development that should have propelled libertarians to greater political power: the continued success of “disruptive” Silicon Valley companies like Uber and Airbnb. These companies have clearly displayed at a national level the manifest benefits of deregulation and less central planning. Not only have these companies inspired an entire generation of young entrepreneurs, but these businesses have become political players in their own right, with countless successful campaigns that leveraged their popularity among their consumer base to pressure politicians to reduce government regulation.
Add it all together, and it looked like the libertarian movement had everything it needed for a winning agenda: a strong national candidate, lots of money and political infrastructure, and plenty of business and activist support to draw on. What went so horribly wrong?
The short-term answer clearly involves the rise of Donald Trump. If you're Rand Paul, it would be difficult to draw any other conclusion. The 10 percent to 20 percent of the Republican primary base that might normally turn out for a Ron or Rand Paul has shifted to the populist, xenophobic camp of Donald Trump. Libertarians come in all shapes and sizes, and if the polls are to be believed, many prefer at this moment to support a candidate who gives voice to their frustrations rather than their hopes for reducing the scale and size of government. As Michael Lind at Politico put it back in September:
“...Trump's popularity is, in effect, final proof of what some of us have been arguing for years: that the Tea Party is less a libertarian movement than a right-wing version of populism. Think William Jennings Bryan or Huey Long, not Ayn Rand. Tea Partiers are less upset about the size of government overall than they are that so much of it is going to other people, especially immigrants and nonwhites. They are for government for them and against government for Not-Them.”
But the rise of Donald Trump doesn't explain why libertarians have gotten so little out of Congress and the legislative process as a whole. This is where the hundreds of millions of dollars from the Koch brothers were supposed to yield tangible results. But if Congress is any measure, the Kochs haven't gotten a lot for their money, insofar as you believe that their goals are ultimately libertarian. The only real attempt to flex libertarian muscle was the failed repeal of the Export-Import Bank, and the Kochs lost that battle entirely. After all those hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kochs, this Republican Congress has been much more motivated to attack Planned Parenthood and oust its own speaker than to cut entitlements, replace Obamacare, reduce federal regulation, or otherwise pursue a libertarian agenda. The Koch brothers have seen more legislative success on the state and local level, but just as in Congress, it's usually been the standard anti-liberal, pro-corporate agenda that establishment Republicans never objected to in the first place.

The real roots of this collapse should be no surprise: establishment Republicans have every reason to “cheat” on their libertarian leanings. Ronald Reagan deserves a lot of credit for bringing the smaller government ethos to the Republican Party, but most Republican politicians since then have found it much more useful to simply pay lip service to the libertarian movement while quietly taking the side of incumbent businesses whenever those two interests conflict. Establishment Democrats have a similar response to their pro-consumer supporters who want to see the big banks, the cable companies and the healthcare industries subject to greater market forces, but never seem to pull the trigger when real reform is on the table.
For establishment Republicans in particular, the temptation to cheat and pick winners and losers is often too hard to resist. Sure, they may talk a big game about believing in the free market, but once they become aware of whom the winners or losers of a legislative change will be, that belief in the free market gets tossed by the wayside. It becomes about rewarding your side or punishing the other team, not about reducing the size of government. A Republican member of congress may not like big government, but when it comes to cutting the generous agricultural subsidies that go to their hardworking constituents, their stated ideology often has a funny way of bending.
Saab fans "occupy" GM Facebook wall
Nov 21, 2011, 8:59am ET
by Andrew Ganz
Saab enthusiasts have taken to GM's Facebook wall in an effort to help save the Swedish brand.
Upset with General Motors' statement that it would not support a sale of its former Saab unit to a pair of Chinese automakers, enthusiasts of the small Swedish brand have banded together for a Facebook "occupation" of sorts.
"Let Saab go" is the operative phrase typed by what appears to be about three individual Facebook commenters an hour. Many commenters have included photos of their own Saab vehicles.
GM has said it will not approve a plan by Swedish Automobile, Saab's Dutch holding company, to sell Saab to Chinese industrial firms Pang Da and Youngman. GM sold Saab to Dutch supercar manufacturer Spyker, which later formed Swedish Automobile, in 2010, but the Michigan automaker retained a small share in the brand, as well as the rights to distribute certain technologies. GM also builds Saab's newest model, the 9-4x crossover, under contract.
Saab says it has remained in constant contact with GM regarding the deal, although no official word has emerged from either side.
This isn't the first time that GM has shown some concern with selling Saab to Chinese buyers. In 2009 and 2010, several Chinese brands were named as possible suitors, but GM flatly rejected all offers from buyers outside of North America and Europe.
Tough new security measures, including restrictions on bags allowed in stadiums, surprise fans at NFL preseason games. NBC News' Chris Pollone reports.
For many football fans this month, the excitement of seeing their favorite side play the first game of a new season will likely be teamed with frustration over strict new regulations governing what types of bags can be brought into stadiums.
Less than a month after April's deadly Boston Marathon bombings, the NFL's Stadium Security Committee voted unanimously to limit the size and type of bags allowed into stadiums.
The new rules ruffled more than a few feathers as excited fans attempted to get into preseason games last week, only to find that the bags they were accustomed to bringing in were no longer allowed.
“I had season tickets for over 36 years and they continue to complicate things over and over again,” a Cleveland Browns fan said on their way into the game last Thursday.
The new rules state that fans are allowed to bring in one small clutch style purse, plus a one gallon plastic storage bag or a bag provided by the team that measures about 12 inches by 12 inches.
Those who fail to comply with the new rules will be turned away.
An NFL spokesperson said the policy is not meant to make the fan experience more difficult, but only “to deliver a better and quicker experience at the gates and also provide a safer environment.”
While there may be growing pains as fans return for the start of the 2013 NFL season, league officials believe the football faithful will soon adapt without problem.
“I understand the safety procedures, I understand the caution that they're going through,” said one fan, whose large purse was not allowed into the game.

Jeremy Langford 's fantasy value has been rising fast in the past week. In a year starved for quality running backs, can Langford be a savior for your fantasy team?
ADP Rising
Langford had been sitting solidly in the mid-5th round for the past month. However, the pre-season game against the Patriots on August 18th changed everything.
In that game, Langford had eight carries for 55 yards and a touchdown. That performance answered questions around their ability and workload.
Below is Langford's average draft position for 12-team drafts in PPR scoring over the past month. The data is driven by PPR fantasy football mock drafts here on Fantasy Football Calculator.
Their ADP has now risen to the 11th pick in the 4th round.
Their performance yesterday against the Chiefs was somewhat mixed. They only went 6 for 17 yards, but they demonstrated that they are clearly the lead back. They also had a nice 10 yard gain that showed burst and power (video @ NFL.com)
Warnings…
However! There is a reason he's not a 1st or 2nd rounder. Given that he's a lead running back, why are they so low to begin with?
Both Football Outsiders and Pro Football Focus warn that Langford isn't a special talent. Their advanced metrics are tepid on the 2nd year running back, which is one reason why Langford is available in the 4th round.
Draft Strategy
Langford can fit into your draft strategy if you are willing to pull the trigger on them in the 4th round. If you wait until the 5th round, it will probably be too late.
While is average draft position is 4.11, the Scenario Calculator shows that in a 12-team PPR league, you only have a 28% chance of them being on the board at the 5.03 draft pick.
If you take them in the late 4th, they could fit into a WR/WR/RB/RB strategy. In 12-team PPR leagues, drafting from the 3rd position, that strategy performs significantly better than other draft strategies, scoring an extra 3 fantasy points per week.
And if you're going wide receiver heavy early in your draft, a quick look at the other running backs being taken in the 4th round shows that they all have their own question marks as well.
Conclusion
Many signs are pointing to a breakthrough year for Jeremy Langford. As a 4th round draft pick, they could give you excellent running back production after you've loaded up on wide receivers.
Solar panels come in many forms: Crystalline silicon, thin film, even sprays and transparent plastic.
Time to add paper to the list.
A research team from the MIT has developed a flexible and extremely thin solar technology that, when printed, looks like an ordinary document ready to be stapled and turned in as homework.
But when wires are clipped to one end of a floppy sheet and set in the sun, it can power an LCD clock display and other small “gizmos,” researchers said. The technology may help push the solar industry away from hulking, expensive installations and toward options that can easily generate renewable electricity anywhere.
Using vaporous “inks” made from common elements rather than pricey, toxic components like tellurium, solar cells are deposited onto plain, untreated paper -- including tissue, tracing paper and even newsprint.
The process, which is similar to the one used to make the shiny interior of potato chip bags, is nearly as simple as ink-jet printing -- just with a vacuum chamber thrown in.
The pages can be molded into paper airplanes and still generate electricity when unfolded. They're also long-lasting, according to researchers, who tested cells produced last year.
The technology, according to MIT engineers, is cheaper and more adaptable than current commercial solar options that use glass and require heavy support structures. Paper solar cells, they said, could be taped to a wall, attached to laptops or made into window shades and clothing, even laminated to protect against harsh weather.
It'll be a while before commercialization, since researchers are still working on improving the device's efficiency from its current 1%. But maybe Apple Inc., which has studied how to create a solar-powered touch screen for its smartphones, should call them up.
The MIT team reported the findings in the Advanced Materials journal this month. Watch the cell being folded below:

Match date: 20 September 2015
Borussia Dortmund have had an excellent start under Thomas Tuchel, coming into the match having played ten matches and winning all ten. The Dortmund players have spoken about how refreshing Tuchel is and how attentive to detail they are, as well as how tactically sound the German coach is. While Dortmund has started brilliantly, Leverkusen have struggled a bit to recapture their good form of last season.
This is Borussia Dortmund's first ‘big' test under Tuchel. Bayer Leverkusen have been excellent under Roger Schmidt, so it was always going to be a good match. Tuchel continued with a 4-2-3-1 / 4-1-4-1 and had their strongest XI on the field, excluding Marco Reus who was only fit enough for the bench with a toe injury.
Bayer Leverkusen and Roger Schmidt started in a 4-4-2 with the newest signing, Javier Hernandez, up top with Stefan Kiessling.
Leverkusen's Press, Hummels
So far under Thomas Tuchel, Gündoğan and Weigl have been incredibly important to Dortmund's play. When Borussia Dortmund played Monchengladbach, Gündoğan's display seemed to capture a lot of what Tuchel wanted their side to look like. Since that 4-0 win, Dortmund have continued in good form and continue to impress with the performances behind the good results. Up against Leverkusen, however, they had their biggest test. This is not really because Leverkusen are a ‘big club' in Germany or because they did well last year compared to Dortmund, but rather because of Roger Schmidt's tactics. They enjoy a high-tempo match with their sides continuously pressing high up the pitch while Dortmund like to control the ball (as good Bayern Munich though and Leverkusen lost that match 3-0) and will look to play out of the back through Leverkusen's pressing.
The opening minutes of the match saw Hummels and Sokratis exchanging passes. Leverkusen were high up the pitch in a 4-4-2, but neither striker was putting pressure on the Dortmund centre backs, instead, they were cutting off the passing lanes into Gündoğan and Weigl. Calhanoglu and Bellarabi were both narrow as well, again, hoping to cut off the forward passing lanes from Sokratis and Hummels, in particular. The German centre back is one of the best ball-playing centre backs in the game, so if Leverkusen and Schmidt were going to cut off the passes to Gündoğan and Weigl, they had to ensure that Hummels did not have any forward options. Below you can see a screen capture from early in the match with Sokratis on the ball. Notice the positioning of the Leverkusen strikers and wide players as they cut off those passes in the Dortmund centre midfielders.
This approach from Leverkusen worked to an extent as Gündoğan and Weigl and struggled to get on the ball less than they typically would, although because of the high percentage of Dortmund's possession in the match, they still saw plenty of the ball. In the above screen capture, you can see where Weigl wants to be receiving the ball; between the first and second lines of Leverkusen's pressing. Early on, however, Leverkusen's positioning forced Hummels and Sokratis to play the ball into their respective full backs; a forward pass, but not really breaking Leverkusen's pressing lines and because of that were not that threatening, rather than getting the ball into Weigl.
Even when Dortmund's midfielders were getting on the ball, a Leverkusen player was usually touch tight to them, forcing the ball back to Hummels and Sokratis. With Leverkusen suffocating passes into Gündoğan and Weigl, Dortmund had to work the ball to Kagawa and Aubameyang another way and so Hummels became the deep-lying playmaker of sorts that Gündoğan was in that 4-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach. However, for Hummels to get the ball through the Leverkusen midfield, it meant that Gündoğan and Weigl had to be clever in their movement. The Dortmund duo had to drift apart to drag the Leverkusen players with them and create a passing lane for Hummels to play forward. The outward movement of Gündoğan and Weigl was a trigger for Aubameyang to come checking in for a pass from Hummels, likewise with Hummels to Kagawa. The first good Dortmund attack came from this scenario. Bellarabi left their position to press Hummels, Weigl began moving into the half space with Javier Hernandez following him, and Aubameyang checked into the centre passing lane that was created. A few passes later, Jonas Hofmann had a good chance. Below is a screen capture of Hummels' ball bypassing the Dortmund midfield as well as Leverkusen's first two lines of pressure.
For the first half, Kagawa and Aubameyang were the target players for Dortmund. Gündoğan and Weigl were responsible for creating the passing lanes into the more advanced two and Hummels had to play the pass. There were times when Kagawa would move into the wide areas, again, triggered by the movement of Gündoğan and Weigl in the midfield. In the match, Hummels made ten passes to Kagawa and Aubameyang, nine of which came in the first half as Dortmund bypassed the midfield and Leverkusen's press.
Dortmund Going Forward
During Dortmund's build up play, Gündoğan and Weigl were usually on the same receiving line, but when the home side were able to break Leverkusen's press, Dortmund's shape was more of a 4-1-4-1 than a 4-2-3-1 with Gündoğan moving forward to be in line with Kagawa. Mkhitaryan and Hofmann would typically drift in and out of the half spaces laterally, opening up space either centrally for Kagawa and Gündoğan to operate or in the wide areas for Ginter and Schmelzer to get forward, or they would push further forward in line with Aubameyang. Weigl was almost always available when Dortmund were in Leverkusen's half as the home side had a man advantage in the centre of the pitch. Weigl's positioning allowed the home side to move the ball more freely as Leverkusen defended in a 4-4-2 for most of the match, although looked like a 4-2-3-1 at times in the second half. Below is an example of Dortmund's shape when in possession in Leverkusen's half, in particular focusing on the midfield triangle's shape.
The particular phase above came after Dortmund had overloaded the left side of the pitch, which they look to do often under Tuchel. Aubameyang, Kagawa, and Mkhitaryan had all drifted over while Hofmann took up a central striker role. Dortmund overloaded the left constantly throughout the match, opening up the right side for a quick switch, but the combination play on the left, through the half space and centrally, particularly between Kagawa and Mkhitaryan, was excellent and dragged the Leverkusen back line out of their shape consistently.
A year ago, Mkhitaryan was looking down and out at Dortmund. They struggled to find the form that earned them a move from Shakhtar Donetsk, but under Tuchel, they have looked fantastic. As mentioned above, Mkhitaryan's movement through the half space on the left was fantastic. They would drift inside and their combination play with Kagawa, Aubameyang, and Schmelzer was excellent. The Armenian international was excellent with the ball at their feet as well. They would pick up the ball in the left half space and go on diagonal runs with the ball, evading defenders, while creating space for their teammates. It was not as explosive as Messi's runs, but against Leverkusen, it was just as effective in getting away from defenders and creating space.
Schmidt's Changes
At halftime, Schmidt took off Kiessling and Kramer. Neither performed particularly well. Kiessling was unable to really help Javier Hernandez press either Hummels or Sokratis and the German striker was unable to keep up with the movement of the ball to take away the central passing lanes. They were also meant to be an aerial outlet for Leverkusen when Dortmund pressed, but they struggled to win their duals against Sokratis and Hummels. With that, it made sense for Schmidt to replace them with a more energetic forward option in Julian Brandt. The thought behind the youngster's introduction was to allow more pressing, but also a counter attacking option. With Brandt, Bellarabi partnered Hernandez up top.
Schmidt also brought Mehmedi on at halftime for Kramer. This moved Calhanoglu into the middle with Kampl, which gave Leverkusen an energetic midfield duo, but meant they lacked some a real ball winner in the centre of the pitch.
Conclusion
Tuchel's side got the best of Leverkusen in every part of the match. While Leverkusen's pressing seemed difficult to break down at times, Dortmund were able to adjust in order to break the lines. With this win, it gives Dortmund 11 wins in 11 matches under Tuchel. The movement of the midfield was key to opening up Leverkusen and going forward, Dortmund's combination play was too much for Leverkusen.
Schmidt has struggled to find the form of last year and now has just six points from their opening five matches. Tuchel tactically got much the best of Schmidt with the latter never really adjusting their side once Dortmund were able to pass through the midfield.
Aims to 'make the kinds of games [he] really wants to make'
A few years ago, Keiji Inafune left Capcom to pursue independent game development. Following in those footsteps, Koji Igarashi worked their last day at Konami this past Saturday, March 15. Igarashi has been synonymous with the Castlevania franchise since their work on Symphony of the Night. They intend to open their own development studio, hoping to make games their fans will enjoy.
In an interview with IGN, Igarashi said, "I've decided to break out on my own to have the freedom to make the kind of games I really want to make -- the same kind I think fans of my past games want as well. Leaving Konami was a big decision, and not one I took lightly – I've spent my entire career there, made many friends, and had a lot of great opportunities – but I hope all the gamers and fans who have supported me in the past will join me in being excited about what comes next. Wish me luck!”
Before leaving Konami, they had been an employee for almost 25 years, and has been credited in more than a dozen Castlevania titles. I'm hoping we finally get an HD 2D Castlevania-like from their new studio. It is what the fans want, after all.

News Sam Nicholson Back in Scotland, Mulling Minnesota Offer by Jeff Rueter on 8 June 2017
Sam Nicholson met with Minnesota United last week and left the club with an offer. With the summer transfer window looming, he's struggling to make a decision.
On May 29, we reported that Sam Nicholson was on their way to meet with Minnesota United about a possible contract. The Scottish winger arrived on a Tuesday and met with Minnesota brass throughout the week.
FiftyFive.One has now learned that Nicholson is back in Scotland mulling their options. While it seems Nicholson is receptive to Minnesota's offer, they do have plenty of teams after their signature. Among the clubs with reported interest are Barnsley, Bristol City, Rangers, and Aberdeen.
Have you taken the FiftyFive.One Reader Poll? Vote for the Bests of Minnesota and win a gift card to Town Hall Brewery!
At this time, there's no indication whether or not there will be further talks between the Loons and Nicholson. It's believed that Minnesota's offer is the most lucrative of the five, but moving across the Atlantic would be a big step for any player. That said, the salary Minnesota has offered Nicholson is below the Designated Player threshold.
An out-and-out winger, Nicholson would bring exceptional pace and technical ability on the ball. They play exclusively on the left wing.
As Nicholson's contract expires in the coming month, they wouldn't be able to join Minnesota until July 10. Once the summer transfer window opens, incoming players can be ready to suit up for their new clubs. However, Minnesota United's senior roster is currently full –any incoming move would require somebody to be jettisoned. Ultimately, Nicholson's decision is likely to come in the next couple of weeks.

An annual ranking of the world's top universities suggests Canada's institutions may be losing ground, at a time when Asia's schools are rising.
The Times Higher Education 2016-17 World University Rankings has ranked Canada's perennial top three performers all lower this year:
University of Toronto fell from 19 to 22
University of British Columbia moved down from 34 to 36
McGill University dropped from 38 to 42
Asia's top three universities, meanwhile, were all up:
National University of Singapore moved from 26 to 24
China's Peking University leaped from 42 to 29
China's Tsinghua University bumped up from 47 to 35.
Only six of the 25 Canadian universities that were ranked in 2015-16 improved:
University of Montreal is ranked 103 (up from 113)
University of Alberta is ranked 107 (up from 137)
University of Waterloo is ranked 173 (up from 179)
University of Calgary is ranked 195 (up from 201-250)
Queen's University and Simon Fraser University are between 201 and 250 (up from between 251 to 300)
Times Higher Education Editor Phil Baty said it's proof “Canada will have to watch out for Asia's continuing ascent.”
“Canada's success cannot be guaranteed in the long-term while more of Asia's leading universities soar to join the world elite,” they added.
Canada's research funding – a major component of the rankings -- fell from third in the OECD in 2006 to eighth in 2013, according to Universities Canada. However, the country's three main granting agencies got a $95-million boost in the 2016 budget, so that may help with next year's ranking.
In total, Times Higher Education evaluated 980 universities using 13 numerical indicators related to teaching, research, citations, international outlook and industry income.
There are 26 universities on the list from Canada this year, including new entrant University of Windsor.
The annual ranking continues to be topped by institutions from the United Kingdom and the U.S.
Here are the top 200:
Clothes often look horrible in video games. People look like they have their suits and dresses painted on their bodies. Or their capes clip right through their arms.
Terrible.
And hair... long hair almost never works. So you get all these games that won't let you give your character long hair.
Thank goodness we've got people like Cloakworks' Joe van den Heuvel trying to solve this. He's got some tech called Shroud that he's showing in a small booth at the Game Developer's Conference (here's the official website). The tech was borne from work done for a Batman: Gotham by Gaslight pitch (see that here). It will be used in the next Hitman, Hitman Absolution. I expect Agent 47's coat to flap and drape realistically. Now if only the guy had long hair...
There's nothing quite like “Live PD,” the hit A&E series that follows cops and sheriffs — live, in real time, as they patrol various cities and counties across the country. The series began as an eight-episode experiment, for two hours a week, back in October 2016. But as it turned into a sensation, A&E kept expanding the show's footprint.
Now, “Live PD” airs twice a week, on Friday and Saturday nights, for three hours both evenings (from 9 p.m. to midnight). And other than a brief five-week hiatus in September, it's been on the air for most of the year.
“It is by far the most frustrating, challenging, and gratifying program that I have ever been involved with,” said executive producer Dan Cesareo, whose Big Fish Entertainment is behind the series. “No two nights are the same. You could have a great show one night, where we made the right decisions and did a great job with the storytelling, and then the next night you could hit the tunnel where it feels like you've never made the show before.”
It's that kind of unpredictability that has turned “Live PD” into a sensation for A&E. Viewership is up 145 percent from its launch, and it's now averaging 2.1 million viewers — helping make A&E the most-watched non-sports network among adults 18-49 and adults 25-54 in those timeslots.
Dan Abrams hosts “Live PD” with analysis by Tom Morris Jr., and other in-studio guests who provide commentary for what's going on. “Live PD” will air its final episodes this weekend before a two-week holiday break, and feature fan favorite Deputy Rebecca Loeb of Lake County, Ill., known for their pink handcuffs.
IndieWire asked Cesareo to share a few secrets from “Live PD” as it heads into its final weekend telecast of 2017.
A&E
“Live PD” may boast the most chaotic control room in all television.
Unlike every other show — including most live events — there is no production rundown for “Live PD.” Every episode is produced by the seat of their pants.
“It's a crazy, difficult show to produce,” Cesareo said. “We're the only live show on television where we show up at 9 p.m. we have three hours of television to make and we have no clue where we're going or how it's going to unfold.”
Some observers have compared “Live PD” to DirecTV's “Red Zone,” which similarly shifts to different cameras, depending on the action. But “the thing about the ‘Red Zone' is you know someone is trying to put the ball in an end zone. I think ‘Live PD' is closest to a significant breaking news event where you just don't know how the story's going to unfold.”
Every episode takes place in six cities, with two police units in each city.
During the show, there are 12 units being filmed live, and with three cameras per unit, that's at least 36 cameras chronicling the action. Producers in the studio are in constant contact with producers in the field.
“You're building a puzzle based on timing that you have to figure out,” Cesareo said. “Sometimes a department will say, ‘We'll be there in two minutes,' and it takes them 12. Other times, they say they'll be there in five to seven minutes and all of a sudden they're there in 30 seconds. It's learning that shorthand, how these departments operate.”
Departments that have participated so far on “Live PD” include Allen County (Ky.) Sheriff's Office, Arizona Department of Public Safety, Bridgeport (Conn.) Police Department, Calvert County (Md.) Sheriff's Office, Clark County (Iowa) Sheriff's Office, Edmonson (Ky.) County Sheriff's Office, Jeffersonville (Iowa) Police Department, Lake County (Ill.) Sheriff's Office, Logan County (Ky.) Sheriff's Office, Midland County (Tex.) Sheriff's Office, Mission (Tex.) Police Department, Pasco County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office, Richland County (S.C.) Sheriff's Office, St. Tammany Parrish (La.) Sheriff's Office, Santa Rosa County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office, Spokane County (Wash.) Sheriff's Office, Tulsa (Okla.) Police Department Gang Unit, Utah Department of Public Safety, Wakulla County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office, Walton County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office and Warren County (Ky.) Sheriff's Office. Additional departments are in negotiations for 2018.
“We really wanted a cross-section of law enforcement,” they said. “We didn't just want cities or heavy metropolitan areas.”
Viewers at home have pointed out activity — such as suspects throwing drugs out of car windows — that even police have missed.
“Different departments handle it differently,” Cesareo said. “There are departments that monitor Twitter during the show, and when the viewers point something out, they might send an officer back to investigate it. For us it's happening so quickly, most of the time the viewers are seeing things we learned about the same way the police does.”
The show doesn't select the officers who appear on camera.
“We work with the department and follow the officers who have shifts when we're live,” Cesareo said. “The cameras are there so much and filming along a longer period of time that people are who they are. Anyone who thinks they're going to behave differently when the cameras are present, that goes away very quickly.”
A&E
The control room team boasts live news and sports experience, while camera operators in the field were recruited from other law enforcement TV shows.
Director John Gonzalez was originally approached for a recommendation on another candidate, but they were so intrigued by “Live PD” that they signed on himself. Gonzales' background includes Major League Baseball, while their team combined boasts more than 10,000 hours of live news coverage. But for the crew on the front lines, Cesareo said it was key to find producers and camera operators who were well versed in covering law enforcement.
“Safety is paramount, it's something we reinforce on a weekly basis,” they said. “They've all shot on all sorts of shows and been in high-risk environments.”
Lawyers are stationed in the control room to make sure the show is protected.
Because “Live PD” is considered a live news program, the show is legally able to show faces on camera. But both Big Fish and A&E have attorneys in hand in the control room to make sure “Live P.D.” isn't exposed to any legal problems. “We spent a lot of time and a lot of careful thought in the nine to 12 months we were developing the show before it launched, really crafting our legal protocol,” Cesareo said.
Like most law enforcement series, “Live PD” is starting to receive requests for footage, which is owned by A&E. It's handled on a case-by-case basis.
With so much footage being shot weekly, most of it is deleted afterward.
Anything that appears on air is saved, of course, but “Live PD” is also shooting throughout the week, and most of what doesn't make it on screen is recycled. “It's cost prohibitive to keep it,” Cesareo said. “We have 36 to 40 camerae, and if they're shooting three hours a night on the weekend and during the week we're generating 300 to 400-plus hours of content a week.”
A squealing pig may have been the show's funniest moment so far.
“Live PD” was shooting in Florida last month when cops began to pursue a suspect who bailed out of a car and started running. But in the course of tracking that guy down, police came across a pet pot-bellied pig that was on the loose.
“The officer decides they're going to corner this pig and figure out who had lost it,” Cesareo said. “They picked this pig up and this pig squeals and goes crazy for a good minute or minute and a half. The owner comes running. It went from this very high tense moment to this moment of levity and I think that's what's unique about this show. It captures this job like nothing else that has come before.
“The moments I love in ‘Live PD' are the moments that would never be in an edited show. When you make an edited show it's about a singular story, how you're putting it together. What we're doing is pointing the camera at these stories and giving it all.”
“Live PD” airs Fridays and Saturdays at 9 p.m. on A&E.
LOS ANGELES — Disney ended its fiscal year in blockbuster style on Thursday, reporting solid growth in fourth-quarter profit, unveiling a substantial Netflix deal and savoring a stock price that has climbed 35 percent over the last 12 months.
Its challenge now is to keep the momentum going.
For the fiscal quarter that ended Sept. 28, the Walt Disney Company reported a profit of $1.39 billion, or 77 cents a share, a 12 percent increase from $1.24 billion, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 7 percent, to $11.57 billion. The results beat analyst expectations.
Disney's theme parks provided the biggest boost, although one resort — Disneyland Paris — continued to slump. Operating profit for the company's parks division, which includes Disney Cruise Line, increased 15 percent, to $571 million. Disney noted that higher ticket prices at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California contributed to a 9 percent increase in per-capita guest spending at those parks. Tokyo Disney Resort also had a strong quarter.
At Disney Consumer Products, operating income surged 30 percent, to $347 million. Merchandise tied to the animated movie “Planes” sold particularly well — “an incredible juggernaut,” Disney's chief financial officer, Jay Rasulo, told analysts in a conference call.
Transparency, openness, and reproducibility are readily recognized as vital features of science (1, 2). When asked, most scientists embrace these features as disciplinary norms and values (3). Therefore, one might expect that these valued features would be routine in daily practice. Yet, a growing body of evidence suggests that this is not the case (4–6).
A likely culprit for this disconnect is an academic reward system that does not sufficiently incentivize open practices (7). In the present reward system, emphasis on innovation may undermine practices that support verification. Too often, publication requirements (whether actual or perceived) fail to encourage transparent, open, and reproducible science (2, 4, 8, 9). For example, in a transparent science, both null results and statistically significant results are made available and help others more accurately assess the evidence base for a phenomenon. In the present culture, however, null results are published less frequently than statistically significant results (10) and are, therefore, more likely inaccessible and lost in the “file drawer” (11).
The situation is a classic collective action problem. Many individual researchers lack strong incentives to be more transparent, even though the credibility of science would benefit if everyone were more transparent. Unfortunately, there is no centralized means of aligning individual and communal incentives via universal scientific policies and procedures. Universities, granting agencies, and publishers each create different incentives for researchers. With all of this complexity, nudging scientific practices toward greater openness requires complementary and coordinated efforts from all stakeholders.
THE TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS PROMOTION GUIDELINES. The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Committee met at the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia, in November 2014 to address one important element of the incentive systems: journals' procedures and policies for publication. The committee consisted of disciplinary leaders, journal editors, funding agency representatives, and disciplinary experts largely from the social and behavioral sciences. By developing shared standards for open practices across journals, we hope to translate scientific norms and values into concrete actions and change the current incentive structures to drive researchers' behavior toward more openness. Although there are some idiosyncratic issues by discipline, we sought to produce guidelines that focus on the commonalities across disciplines.
ILLUSTRATION: DAVIDE BONAZZI
Standards. There are eight standards in the TOP guidelines; each moves scientific communication toward greater openness. These standards are modular, facilitating adoption in whole or in part. However, they also complement each other, in that commitment to one standard may facilitate adoption of others. Moreover, the guidelines are sensitive to barriers to openness by articulating, for example, a process for exceptions to sharing because of ethical issues, intellectual property concerns, or availability of necessary resources. The complete guidelines are available in the TOP information commons at http://cos.io/top, along with a list of signatories that numbered 86 journals and 26 organizations as of 15 June 2015. The table provides a summary of the guidelines.
First, two standards reward researchers for the time and effort they have spent engaging in open practices. (i) Citation standards extend current article citation norms to data, code, and research materials. Regular and rigorous citation of these materials credit them as original intellectual contributions. (ii) Replication standards recognize the value of replication for independent verification of research results and identify the conditions under which replication studies will be published in the journal. To progress, science needs both innovation and self-correction; replication offers opportunities for self-correction to more efficiently identify promising research directions.
Second, four standards describe what openness means across the scientific process so that research can be reproduced and evaluated. Reproducibility increases confidence in results and also allows scholars to learn more about what results do and do not mean. (i) Design standards increase transparency about the research process and reduce vague or incomplete reporting of the methodology. (ii) Research materials standards encourage the provision of all elements of that methodology. (iii) Data sharing standards incentivize authors to make data available in trusted repositories such as Dataverse, Dryad, the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the Open Science Framework, or the Qualitative Data Repository. (iv) Analytic methods standards do the same for the code comprising the statistical models or simulations conducted for the research. Many discipline-specific standards for disclosure exist, particularly for clinical trials and health research more generally (e.g., www.equator-network.org). Many more are emerging for other disciplines, such as those developed by Psychological Science (12).
Finally, two standards address the values resulting from preregistration. (i) Standards for preregistration of studies facilitate the discovery of research, even unpublished research, by ensuring that the existence of the study is recorded in a public registry. (ii) Preregistration of analysis plans certify the distinction between confirmatory and exploratory research, or what is also called hypothesis-testing versus hypothesis-generating research. Making transparent the distinction between confirmatory and exploratory methods can enhance reproducibility (3, 13, 14).
Levels. The TOP Committee recognized that not all of the standards are applicable to all journals or all disciplines. Therefore, rather than advocating for a single set of guidelines, the TOP Committee defined three levels for each standard. Level 1 is designed to have little to no barrier to adoption while also offering an incentive for openness. For example, under the analytic methods (code) sharing standard, authors must state in the text whether and where code is available. Level 2 has stronger expectations for authors but usually avoids adding resource costs to editors or publishers that adopt the standard. In Level 2, journals would require code to be deposited in a trusted repository and check that the link appears in the article and resolves to the correct location. Level 3 is the strongest standard but also may present some barriers to implementation for some journals. For example, the journals Political Analysis and Quarterly Journal of Political Science require authors to provide their code for review, and editors reproduce the reported analyses publication. In the table, we provide “Level 0” for comparison of common journal policies that do not meet the transparency standards.
Adoption. Defining multiple levels and distinct standards facilitates informed decision-making by journals. It also acknowledges the variation in evolving norms about research transparency. Depending on the discipline or publishing format, some of the standards may not be relevant for a journal. Journal and publisher decisions can be based on many factors—including their readiness to adopt modest to stronger transparency standards for authors, internal journal operations, and disciplinary norms and expectations. For example, in economics, many highly visible journals such as American Economic Review have already adopted strong policies requiring data sharing, whereas few psychology journals have comparable requirements.
In this way, the levels are designed to facilitate the gradual adoption of best practices. Journals may begin with a standard that rewards adherence, perhaps as a step toward requiring the practice. For example, Psychological Science awards badges for “open data,” “open materials,” and “preregistration” (12), and approximately 25% of accepted articles earned at least one badge in the first year of operation.
Summary of the eight standards and three levels of the TOP guidelines Levels 1 to 3 are increasingly stringent for each standard. Level 0 offers a comparison that does not meet the standard.
The Level 1 guidelines are designed to have minimal effect on journal efficiency and workflow while also having a measurable impact on transparency. Moreover, although higher levels may require greater implementation effort up front, such efforts may benefit publishers and editors and the quality of publications by, for example, reducing time spent on communication with authors and reviewers, improving standards of reporting, increasing detectability of errors before publication, and ensuring that publication-related data are accessible for a long time.
Evaluation and revision. An information common and support team at the Center for Open Science is available (top@cos.io) to assist journals in selection and adoption of standards and will track adoption across journals. Moreover, adopting journals may suggest revisions that improve the guidelines or make them more flexible or adaptable for the needs of particular subdisciplines.
The present version of the guidelines is not the last word on standards for openness in science. As with any research enterprise, the available empirical evidence will expand with application and use of these guidelines. To reflect this evolutionary process, the guidelines are accompanied by a version number and will be improved as experience with my accumulates.
Conclusion. The journal article is central to the research communication process. Guidelines for authors define what aspects of the research process should be made available to the community to evaluate, critique, reuse, and extend. Scientists recognize the value of transparency, openness, and reproducibility. Improvement of journal policies can help those values become more evident in daily practice and ultimately improve the public trust in science, and science itself.
We've got a special guest post today from someone who is an aircraft dispatcher for a major US airline. This person wrote in to me after my interview with Kate Hanni with an enlightening piece on lengthy ground delays that I thought would be of interest to everyone here. Here is their take on things . . .
If folks want the systemic, “big picture” view of why the new 3-hour limit is such a BAD idea, they need go no further than an airline's central dispatch office, or any air traffic control facility, and chat with the actual working dispatchers and air traffic controllers, respectively, who are the front-line troops in the annual weather war.
Dispatch is an airline's “Mission Control” center, and I've worked in one as a dispatcher for upwards of 30 years. A flight crew might operate 3-5 flights per day, but the average dispatcher works ten times that many flights in a single shift, and has a more-detailed awareness and understanding of the various problem areas within the airline's route system. The dispatcher is also the one that plans the flight, including the routes, the alternates, and the fuel load, and is also the one passing along updated info to the crew while enroute. When weather hits, we're also the ones that divert flights, and sometimes, if need be, we also cancel them.
There are two separate and distinct problems with delays, yet Ms. Hanni and their band of followers doesn't seem to be able to discern the critical differences between them. In the last decade or so, there have been a handful of scenarios that produced 7+ hour delays, including, of course, the thunderstorms that caused Ms. Hanni's American flight to be diverted to Austin. Admittedly, all the above situations were intolerable and handled poorly, and these are the “apples” when it comes to the issue of ground delays.
With respect to the delay Ms. Hanni suffered, I captured an image of the radar that night, and there was a big low pressure system anchored over west Texas resulting in a lengthy line of thunderstorms oriented north-to-south in central Texas. I'm sure Ms. Hanni and their ilk probably think a thunderstorm is a thunderstorm, but there are many variables associated with them that vary the net operational impact, such as coverage (Isolated? Scattered? Broken? Solid line?); movement; trend; tops (Permitting aircraft to fly over them, or not); and the potential for the weather to “train” over the same location on the ground. The cells in that line of thunderstorms in Texas the night of Ms. Hanni's flight moved south-to-north and kept DFW in the weather much longer than had this been the more typical line of thunderstorms one sees with an approaching cold front which quickly moves W-E or NW-SE.
I've already mentioned the rare “apples” of the ground delay issues. The “oranges” are the much more common 2-4 hour delays one sees when thunderstorms impact major airports or regions, especially on the east coast. Ms. Hanni's “solution” to the “apples” problem is NOT going to solve the “oranges” problem, yet I think the majority of Ms. Hanni's success with their movement has been the ability to tap into the general public's mistaken notions that ALL delays are equally evil no matter how short the duration; that EVERY operational situation is predictable by the airline with 100% accuracy; and that ANYTIME anything goes wrong it's the automatic fault of the airline. There is no one-size-fits all solution here. Let's look at some common-sense tests, assumptions, misassumptions, and observations:
The general public can relate to the fact that their cross-town car trip will take 1x time in good weather and with dry roads, 2x time if it's raining, and maybe 3x time if there's snow or ice. Is it such a stretch to conclude that aircraft are similarly slowed down in such conditions?
Does it make sense that airlines enjoy delays, or perhaps are they just forced to tolerate them, since (last time I looked) the airlines have no control over the weather? Nobody at an airline “likes” delays, but we realize that a good many of them are the unfortunate cost of doing business within the current ATC system. (The “oranges”, not the “apples.”)
Likewise, does it make sense that airlines have the ability (at 11:07am) to predict with absolute certainty that a thunderstorm (or fog, or whatever) will impact XYZ airport at 5:23pm, or 6:03pm, or 7:16pm? Once bad weather starts occurring, will it end 1:23 from now, or 2:10 from now, or 3:33 from now?
The concept of airspace capacity constraints is a foreign one to the general public, as they look up at all that sky and assume (incorrectly) that it has unlimited capacity. All that open sky, and there's no room for my one flight? Again, that's an individual flight perspective, and one that ignores systemic issues.
As far as “just returning to a gate” and “just getting some portable stairs and buses” go, where can airlines (and airports) find the magic wands needed to conjure up these extra resources (and additional gates) when needed on short notice? Should every airport have double the number of gates normally used “just in case” problems occur? Should Phoenix have the same number of snow plows that Anchorage does? What's reasonable for an airport to have?
Airport capacity is a variable commodity, and not a constant one. Look at the San Francisco airport acceptance rate (AAR) chart, for example. Notice that the AAR (a per hour figure) can vary greatly depending upon what runway(s) are, or are not in use. AAR is the “supply” and the flights that airlines (and non-airlines) fly into the airport are the “demand”. When demand is less than supply, things are good, but when the weather such as surface winds, cloud ceilings, visibilities change (often suddenly, despite forecasts) and drive a change to the runways in use that involve a drop in the AAR, demand then exceeds supply, and delays ensue. Some flights in the air will need to circle, and may even have to divert. Some flights that haven't departed (still on a gate, or on a taxiway awaiting departure) will be delayed (think metered freeway on ramp here).
If a thunderstorm event precludes aircraft from landing at XYZ airport for 2 hours, and XYZ normally handles 50 flights per hour, that's 100 flights that are going to be affected, and they don't just all disappear. Some will be able to hold and get in, others will hold and divert to alternates. Of those flights diverting, some will cancel, and some will refuel and try and go back to XYZ. Once the weather improves at XYZ, ATC will be working a backlog of traffic—things don't immediately snap back to normal once the weather clears out.
If airline schedules are restricted such to always be able to fall within an airport's worst-case AAR, you'll be “solving” a problem that maybe occurs 20% of the time and unnecessarily restricting things during the 80% of the time when it's not warranted.
If we say it's foggy at XYZ and you tell the customer service agent the weather is OK at Aunt Tilly's house nearby, that's nice, but it's only relevant if we're shooting approaches to Aunt Tilly's house and landing in their driveway. It's the weather at the airport that counts. (You'd be genuinely surprised at how often this comes up.)
One hears a great deal about “NextGen” ATC stuff, and while it will help in some operational contexts, it won't in many others such as runway capacity. Also, if one is trying to get from LaGuardia to O'Hare and there's a solid line of thunderstorms from Toronto to Atlanta topping 50,000 feet, it matters not whether the flight is navigating using VORs, GPS, Boy Scout compass, or taxiing on Interstate 80–you're NOT going to get through the weather, and there will be delays.
Please keep in mind that airline employees are not all interchangeable. Customer contact personnel don't have detailed knowledge of the specifics of ATC delays, only that there are ATC delays. Likewise, many pilots only have their viewpoint of their specific flight, and not much awareness of any systemic issues. It's no different than walking into a hospital. It's unreasonable to expect detailed surgical questions to be answered by anyone other than by a surgeon—an admissions clerk won't do–and it's unreasonable to expect that clerk to be trained to answer surgical questions.
In closing, I'll reiterate that nothing that I've written should be construed as acceptance of the delay that Ms. Hanni and others experienced in that handful of really lengthy delay situations. Irrespective of however well-meaning their efforts might have been, their pushing of a one-size-fits-all solution is going to end up being severely counter-productive. By DOT's new 3-hour rule and the huge fines the airlines are now facing, it is the height of financial irresponsibility (if not insanity) for any airline to risk allowing EACH aircraft that busts the 3-hour limit to incur a multi-million dollar fine. Pre-emptive cancellations will occur earlier than the 3-hour mark, so as to ensure aircraft can get through any taxiway gridlock and get back to the gate before the bell does “ding” at 3 hours.

Tresorit for Linux is an end-to-end encrypted file sharing service that allows teams to collaborate securely and easily.
Or so says the press release that landed in my inbox a few days ago.
I generally steer clear of writing about things I don't use, can't use or won't use. Tresorit falls firmly in the former camp as it is aimed at businesses and enterprise users rather than desktop ones like me (and a great many of you).
But it has a feature that warrant it a mention, as illustrated by this comparison chart that pits Tresorit against Dropbox, SpiderOak and Box:
The press release says: “Our zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption provides ultimate security for files: unlike standard file sharing solutions, our encryption is done on the user's s device, guaranteeing that no one else can access the files besides the owner”.
Tresorit is based in Switzerland, and all user data is protected by Swiss privacy laws (stricter than those in the USA, and the EU).
Tresorit isn't free. It costs between £10-£15 a month per use for small businesses, which gives 1TB encrypted cloud storage space per user. Bespoke, but more expensive, enterprise plans are also available.

Nine days after suffering a stroke that had their family rushing to their bedside in Texas, Mr. Hockey woke up hungry. And playful.
It took them about 30 seconds to polish off a huge chocolate-chip muffin. And they chased that with a healthy bowl of yogurt. Then Gordie Howe decided they wanted to sit up a bit and enjoy the visit with their family. As they began to move, their son Murray, the physician, tried to help give them a boost, and Gordie grabbed them with their big right hand to push themselves upward.
The same right hand that was rendered immobile by paralysis when the stroke hit him. A recovery few expected was unfolding. When Gordie needed to move from their bed, they waived off the wheelchair and grabbed a walker. They braced it with both hands and made their way across the room.
It didn't matter that anybody who happened to witness it couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Gordie Howe lent their life to extraordinary achievements that thrilled and astounded fans who filled arenas to watch them play hockey like no one before them — or since.
A medical attendant in the room — and there have been lots of them at daughter Cathy's house in Lubbock these days — was stunned, according to a family member who briefed other family and friends about Mr. Hockey's phenomenal comeback. "Based on the short time frame from their stroke," the attendant said, "I am absolutely astonished."
A short time later, while a nurse held a stethoscope near Gordie's heart, they began tapping their fingers rapidly on their chest, making it sound to the nurse like a herd of horses was galloping across the room.
Gordie smiled, and that is when everyone knew how very far they have come in so short a time. At 86, they remain something of a physical wonder.
Either the stroke wasn't quite as bad as physicians initially thought, or the guy it attacked was so robust that he's been able to shake it off. Dr. John Finley, a former Red Wings physician who has looked after Howe and tended to their many serious injuries and illnesses for more than a half-century, suggests it's a little of both.
"From a physical standpoint, they have the ability to have strength in their muscles that might be needed for this kind of recovery that the average person might not have," Finley said, adding that it appears the stroke was "on the smaller end" of the spectrum from what doctors first feared when they detected the paralysis.
"Every day they gain, it doesn't allow things to happen that become harder and harder to overcome, from a physical standpoint," Finley said.
In other words, the longer Howe fights, the better their prognosis.
So while their father continues their impressive recovery, Murray, a radiologist, has returned to work in Toledo, and Mark flew off to scout other NHL teams for the Wings. Both will return frequently to spell Marty and Cathy.
Gordie is seen each day by a nurse. Twice a week, they spend time with a speech therapist, an occupational therapist and a physical therapist.
Meantime, hockey fans everywhere continue sending prayers. And mail. Bags full of prayers and well-wishes arrive daily — and Gordie listens to every one of them.
Someone sent them a hand-made Wings blanket. The Ilitch family sent a planter the size of Texas.
Although these are better days than any could have expected not so long ago, no one can accurately predict what's ahead for Mr. Hockey.
Gordie Howe, as the sports medics are prone to tell us, is day to day.
Then again, aren't we all?

Sixteen Hull pensioners fleeced out of their savings by a gang of fraudsters posing as police and bank staff were aged between 70 and 94, a court heard.
Prosecutors say the victims were targeted by the London-based gang because they are "from a generation that is public-spirited". They were also said to be from "an age group more likely to have a landline" and have other information available on public records.
Abu Kaher, of Camden Gardens, Camden, London, and Syed Rashid, of West Avenue, Hayes, Middlesex, both 25, are on trial at Hull Crown Court and both deny conspiracy to defraud.
Eight other men have admitted being part of the conspiracy – Tanvir Ahmed, 26, of Birmingham, and Londoners Mohammed Miah, 25, Ali Nuruddin, 25, Junid Patwary, 24, Mizan Ali, 21, Amanul Islam, 25, Ruhin Khan, 24, and Abdul Ali, 25.
Towards the end of the prosecution case on Tuesday, the court heard the ages of each victim for the first time, and how much they lost in the scam.
They included two sisters aged 85 and 81 who lost a combined £20,000 - with one losing £5,000 on consecutive days.
In some cases, the victims had been asked by the gang to withdraw more than they actually did, and were only stopped from doing so by their banks.

A woman aged 94 asked their bank for £10,000, but staff stopped them from withdrawing it. A man aged 87 asked for £9,000, but only lost £5,000. An 83-year-old man was asked for £8,650 - "all they had" - but did not lose any money.
The total actual loss between the 16 was £39,000, but they had been asked for £84,150.
The figures requested for some people who did not lose money were not available, but using an average, police said the potential scale of the fraud was about £112,000.
The court has earlier heard how one pensioner, who was saved from the gang, had told their daughter they were "on police business" as they climbed into a cab booked to take them to their bank. The daughter eventually flagged a police car down, which led to the arrests of Islam and Ali, the jury was told.
A pensioner from Hedon revealed they and their wife lost £2,500 from their joint Lloyds account after they were convinced over the phone they were assisting police by going to their branch and withdrawing the money.
A caller to their landline had said a bank employee had been arrested, £2,000 had gone from their account, and they needed to check other notes for fingerprints.
They handed the money over in an envelope to a man outside their home after being given a previously agreed "password". They had been told they would receive a "reward" of £2,939, but never saw or heard of any of the men involved again.
Both defendants are expected to give evidence in their defence. The trial continues.

ATLANTA, Oct. 31 (UPI) -- Hillary Clinton's trip to Clark Atlanta, a historically black college, was marked by applause and protest.
During their speech on Friday, a small group of protesters briefly drowned out Clinton with chants of: "Black lives matter! Black lives matter!"
Clinton, who had arrived to detail their campaign's latest criminal justice reform proposals, briefly acknowledged the protesters, saying: "Yes, they do. Yes, black lives do matter!"
But the chants continued as they attempted to proceed with their speech. As Clinton became momentarily inaudible, the enthusiastic crowd came to their defense, chanting their name and "Let them talk!"
Eventually, Clinton was allowed to pick up where they left off.
"Race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind," Clinton told the packed auditorium. "Racial profiling is wrong, demanding, doesn't keep us safe or help solve crimes. It's time to put that practice behind us."
In their speech, Clinton promised to end the prosecution and sentencing disparity between cocaine and crack. They also said they would prohibit government agencies and contractors from soliciting criminal history information on job applications, arguing that barriers to gainful employment only encourage repeat offenders.

Atlanta was Clinton's first stop on a swing through the South, where they are expected to continue to court African American support.
Polling suggests Clinton already commands a sizable lead among African Americans, especially in the South, over their closest rival, Bernie Sanders. Sanders has also faced Black Lives Matter protesters.
For their part, the BLM protesters who interrupted Clinton on Friday say they aren't yet satisfied. They want concrete proposals, not just speeches.

"Unfortunately, rhetoric DOES NOT save us, nor does it give confidence to black voters that we can trust Hillary to prioritize the necessity of ensuring our safety," the group said in a released statement. "We've been waiting for weeks to see the platform that addresses these issues from Hillary Clinton's campaign. We will wait no more."
A series of stabbing, shooting and vehicular attacks have resulted in the deaths of eight Israelis at the hands of Palestinians. At least 70 more people have been wounded in the attacks. At least 39 Palestinians have been killed, including 21 who died in clashes with Israeli security forces. Eighteen other Palestinians were killed during alleged attacks on Israelis.
The recent videos, McCants said, are most likely an effort to capitalize on the media attention surrounding the recent spat of violence in Israel and the occupied territories to recruit more fighters.
"Israel doesn't really loom large in Islamic State propaganda," said Will McCants, an IS expert at the Brooking Institution. "It's not mentioned as a top territorial priority for IS acquisition."
The coordinated media campaign, which came out of several IS controlled provinces in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, is a rare foray into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for the group, which typically focuses on recruiting fighters and drawing adherents to the territories under its control.

The Islamic State released a series of videos Sunday praising attacks against Jews in Israel and encouraging more violence.
The coordinated media campaign, which came out of several IS controlled provinces in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, is a rare foray into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for the group, which typically focuses on recruiting fighters and drawing adherents to the territories under its control.
"Israel doesn't really loom large in Islamic State propaganda," said Will McCants, an IS expert at the Brooking Institution. "It's not mentioned as a top territorial priority for IS acquisition."

As the unrest entered its fourth week the Israeli army has moved to lock down Arab portions of East Jerusalem, installing concrete barricades at the edges of Palestinian neighborhoods and establishing impromptu checkpoints on arterial roads in and out of the city.
The IS propaganda videos urge Palestinians to ramp up attacks. Composed in IS's signature macabre style, it includes footage of children executing prisoners, interviews with IS fighters, and stock images of past attacks in Israel. The videos emphasize the religious significance of al-Aqsa — the embattled Jerusalem holy site that's sacred to both Muslims and Jews — and praise past Palestinians who have taken up arms to defend Muslim claims to the holy site.
The recent violence, many Palestinians say, has been fueled by an aggressive Jewish presence at the al-Aqsa compound, including an uptick in visits by religious Jews during the recent holiday season.
In a video released by the Iraqi Nineveh province media wing, Does fighters urge Palestinians "to continue their fight against Jews by all possible means... and to not forget [to use] explosive devices."
By Monday morning, IS had released six separate propaganda videos. One video, titled "Return Terror to the Jews," features a masked fighter who praises Palestinians who attack Jews, calling them "lone wolves who refused to be subdued and spread fear among the sons of Zion."

It's definitely one of the group's biggest propaganda pushes directed at Israel," Nadav Pollak, a counterterrorism expert and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VICE News. "It's a great recruiting tool for them."
The Israeli military was quick to highlight the videos — IDF spokesperson Peter Lerner tweeted out "#ISIS encouraging more beheadings. Now in #Israel."
When contacted by VICE News, Lerner declined to elaborate further on the significance of the videos, or how they would alter Israeli security procedures.
""The current wave of violence, has so far been fueled by the same social media tactics that IS has been using to recruit people," Consul for Media Affairs at the Israeli Consulate in New York Shimon Mercer-Wood said. "We can't completely isolate ourselves from the violent rhetoric that's going on around us."
In the past the Israeli government has been quick to link the US-led coalition's campaign against the Islamic State with its own conflict with the Palestinians. In a speech before the 2014 UN General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proclaimed "Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas."
The reality on the ground may be a bit more complicated.
"ISIS could be trying to recruit people from Hamas, and bring them over to ISIS," Pollak noted. Far from praising the Palestinian leadership, the IS videos released over the weekend contain explicit attacks on both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority for their inability to aggressively confront Israel.
During the most recent round of violence, the Palestinian Authority has largely cooperated with Israel to tamp down unrest, sending in its own security forces to help quell demonstrations.

Some Palestinians worry that the latest Islamic States videos will, ironically, prove to be a strong Israeli propaganda tool.
"The Israeli government tries to make a false link between the Palestinian struggle and what's going on with IS in the region more broadly," said Diana Butto, former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization. "We've never asked anyone from Al Qaeda and ISIS to do this on our behalf."
They fear that the videos will be used by Israelis to link their crackdown on Palestinians with the broader fight against terrorism in the region.
"It should be clear that in Palestine what people are inspired by is not what ISIS says or does," they said. "What's inspiring people is that a generation that was born into occupation."
Pollak disagrees — they fear the videos mark a new trend where IS inspires more violence against Israelis.
"Palestinians see incitement to violence online and that motivates them," they said. Though he's quick to acknowledge that none of the recent attacks can be linked to the group.
"I see it as a effort by IS to capitalize on the current tensions," McCants said. "Rather than anything that's going to have a meaningful impact on ground in the Palestinian territories."

The Infinite Quest is an animated serial based on the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was made by BBC Television, but does not share the same producers as the live-action series. It was aired in twelve weekly parts (three and a half minutes each) starting 2 April 2007 as a segment of the children's spin-off show Totally Doctor Who. The final instalment (after episode 12) was shown at the end of the "Omnibus" episode, thus increasing the total to thirteen parts, making the compiled series the equivalent length of a standard episode of Doctor Who.[1][2] The compiled story was broadcast on 30 June 2007, coinciding with the finale of Series 3.[3]
Synopsis [ edit ]
The Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones set off on an adventure through space to find the datachips to unlock The Infinite, a huge spaceship that can grant people their heart's desire. However, the evil Baltazar is also searching for the ship.
Plot [ edit ]
An alien named Baltazar has set their sights on Earth, planning to compress its population into diamonds. The Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones arrive on their ship, which they hand-crafted himself, to stop him. The Doctor threatens them with a spoon, which Baltazar cuts in half with their metal claw hand. The spoon happens to be made of a special fungus, which when introduced to the metal ship quickly begins to rust it. As the ship falls apart, the Doctor frees Baltazar's huge metallic bird, Caw, who carries Baltazar away. The Doctor muses that Baltazar will end up on the ice prison planet Volag-Noc at some point.
Some time later, Caw takes the Doctor and Martha to their home planet, where they give Martha a brooch as a gift. They also spit up a datachip, explaining that it and three others like it hold the location of The Infinite, an ancient spaceship that can grant people their heart's desire. Each datachip leads to the next one. At first unwilling to search for it and about to destroy the chip, the Doctor is forced to when Caw notes that Baltazar has a copy of the datachip. As the two set off on their quest, Caw is revealed to be working for Baltazar.
The first chip leads to the planet Boukan, where the pirate captain Kaliko is raiding the living oil rigs they find there.  They are wearing the next datachip as an earring. Assuming the Doctor and Martha to be spies for the oil companies, Kaliko tells their crew of skeletons to throw them overboard, unaware that their first mate, Mr. Swabb Mate, is in fact the spy, as they have been promised a new body. Swabb stages a mutiny and has the oil rigs shoot down the ship, but their poor aim causes them to scatter the crew in doing so. After Swabb is knocked out by being knocked off the ship, the Doctor reveals the reason for their visit to Kaliko. They try to escape in a pod, but is found murdered after landing near the TARDIS. With nothing left to do, the Doctor and Martha take their datachip and follow it to the next one.
The next chip is on the planet Myarr, being used as a necklace by a lizard alien named Mergrass. Mergrass has been hired to advise the Mantasphids, alien bugs, on military strategy against the humans attacking them, but in reality is little more than a gun-runner. During an attack by the humans, a pilot is captured. They reveal that the Mantasphids invaded the planet for its fertile dung, and that the humans were there first. To rid themselves of the bugs, the humans have decided to bomb the entire hundred-mile area. The Mantasphid Queen turns to Mergrass for help, but is unwilling to pay them for it, and as such they refuse to arm the weapons they provided them with. As Mergrass leaves, the Doctor is forced to defuse the situation by impersonating the supposed pirate-master, Doctor Vile, of the Mantasphid, which proves successful. Quickly telling the pilot to work with the Mantasphid for the benefit of both species, they follow after Mergrass. By this point, Mergrass has also been killed, so again the Doctor and Martha take the left-behind datachip and head for the next planet.
The final datachip is on the ice prison planet Volag-Noc. Upon arriving, the Doctor is quickly identified as a wanted criminal, sentenced to 2,000,000,000 yrs and dumped in a cell with a damaged robot. Martha is taken to the Governor of the facility, a human named Gurney. They have the final datachip locked in a safe. As they discuss things, both Martha, when Gurney says nobody was to be locked in the cell where the Doctor is, and the Doctor discover that Gurney isn't the Governor, but one of the prisoners. Locke, the robot with whom the Doctor is sharing a cell, is in fact the Governor. The Doctor apparently shouldn't have been put in the cell in the first place. Upon being fixed by the Doctor, Locke decides that all the prisoners are irredeemable and orders their execution, giving Gurney a chance to shoot Locke and escape with the datachip. The Doctor manages to prevent the prisoners' execution.
On the surface, Martha catches up to Gurney, but can do little to stop them without a weapon. At the same time, however, Baltazar arrives riding Caw. Gurney shoots down Caw, but is apparently dispatched by Baltazar off-screen. Caw dies from the damage caused by Gurney's shot while the Doctor and Martha comfort him, claiming they were promised "all the gold they can eat". Baltazar then takes the two hostage, forcing the Doctor to show the way to The Infinite. They also reveal that Martha's "brooch" is actually Squawk, Caw's child, which flies to the body of their parent. Once the Doctor locks in The Infinite's location, Baltazar takes control of the TARDIS – as flying the TARDIS involves little more than a button-press, they no longer needs the Doctor, and knocks them out with a blast. They leaf the Doctor to perish in the snow.
On The Infinite, Baltazar orders Martha to find the hold, which they do by accidentally falling through the deck. In the hold, Martha finds the Doctor waiting for her, but quickly realises that it is a creation of the ship: the ship is doing as promised. The real Doctor is close by, however, riding a matured Squawk. They quickly knock Baltazar out and comes to Martha's aid. The Doctor informs them they just has to reject the vision, which they do, causing it to fade away. The Infinite tries to find the Doctor's heart's desire but they ward it off. They explain that for them it has been nearly three years, in which time they weaned Squawk and helped re-establish Volag-Noc, making sure to tone down the somewhat homicidal Governor. They further explain that the desires granted by The Infinite are little more than illusions, the last spark of whatever powerful being died within its walls. Baltazar has not yet realised this; they are standing in a treasure room, oblivious to Martha's warnings about the illusion. The Doctor uses their sonic screwdriver to vibrate the wreckage, causing the ship to fall apart. They and Martha flee in the TARDIS, leaving Baltazar to rely on Squawk, who has been trained by the Doctor to take Baltazar back to Volag-Noc to be imprisoned. With the day saved, the Doctor and Martha resume their adventures.
Continuity [ edit ]
As Martha is traveling freely with the Doctor, the story may be set somewhere between the series three episodes "42" (which follows directly on from Martha's invitation to long-term travel in "The Lazarus Experiment") and "Utopia" (which begins the series finale). However, the Character Bios on the DVD release state that Martha is traveling with the Doctor for one more trip, which seems to set it before "The Lazarus Experiment". The Doctor states in both the first and third segment that the serial takes place in the 40th century. Caw indicates that many years have passed between the first and second episode, in which time Baltazar has gone to prison, supposedly sold out by Caw, and has since got out again.[4]
The Doctor names various other beings from the same time as The Infinite including the Nestenes (Spearhead from Space, Terror of the Autons, "Rose", "The Pandorica Opens"), the Great Vampires (State of Decay) and the Racnoss, ("The Runaway Bride"), all of which they have met.
While walking the ice cold wastes of the prison planet in their regular clothes, the Doctor seems quite unaffected by the cold. This was a trait shown by the Second Doctor in The Tomb of the Cybermen, the Fourth Doctor in The Seeds of Doom and The Hand of Fear, the Ninth Doctor in "The Unquiet Dead" and the Tenth Doctor in "Planet of the Ood", and an improvement over how the First Doctor responded to cold – not just subzero cold – in The Space Museum.
Outside references [ edit ]
The Doctor compares Baltazar to Napoleon Bonaparte, Boudica, and Blackbeard. The former appeared in The Reign of Terror while the latter appears as a fictional character in The Mind Robber. The Doctor also refers to Delia Smith, Fanny Cradock, and Madame Cholet from The Wombles as among Earth's greatest chefs. Martha refers to Bill Oddie, who played the pirate captain Red Jasper in the Big Finish audio adventure Doctor Who and the Pirates.
Pilot Kelvin describes the final weapon to be deployed on Myarr using the phrase "kills all known bugs, dead." This is similar to the UK advertising slogan for the bleach Domestos.[5] Baltazar's promise to Caw of "as much gold as they could eat" is a reference to Monty Python's Life of Brian in which the same promise is given by Naughtius Maximus to Brian's mother.[citation needed]
DVD release [ edit ]
The serial was released on DVD in its compiled state on 5 November 2007. This release included deleted scenes, interviews and behind-the-scenes documentaries.
This story was released in Australia and New Zealand on 6 June 2008.
BBC Worldwide Americas, BBC Video, and Warner Home Video jointly announced on 31 July 2008 that The Infinite Quest would be released in North America on 18 November 2008 as a single disc (also the same release date for the live-action series' The Complete Fourth Series on DVD for North America). As in Australia and New Zealand, this serial was never broadcast in North America.
Production [ edit ]
One segment of The Infinite Quest was shown each week during Totally Doctor Who from 2 April to 29 June 2007. The serial, animated by Firestep, was the second officially licensed, animated Doctor Who is a serial, the first being the flash-animated Scream of the Shalka (2003). Missing episodes of the 1968 serial The Invasion were also animated for that serial's 2006 DVD release. Both of these animations were produced by Cosgrove Hall. The BBC describes Firestep as "the creative team behind previous Doctor Who animated adventures for the BBC."[1] The Firestep website attributes the name to former Cosgrove Hall animators Jon Doyle and Steve Maher.
An earlier animated series based on Doctor Who, to be produced by Nelvana for CBS, was planned in the 1980s, but fell through.[6] Production art had been drawn up by Ted Bastien.[7] Three limited animated webcasts – Death Comes to Time, Real Time, and Shada – were made and "cast" on the BBC Website before Scream of the Shalka.[8]
A second animated serial, Dreamland, was produced and aired and released in six part on BBC Red Button from 23 November 2009, and was broadcast in full on BBC Two on 5 December 2009.[9]
The title sequence for the omnibus version is identical to that for the television series, except that the photorealistic model of the TARDIS is replaced with a cel-shaded version as it appears in this story.
Cast notes [ edit ]
Anthony Head previously appeared in the Series 2 episode "School Reunion" as Mr Finch. They were also the Doctor's adversary in the Excelis Dawns, Excelis Rising, and Excelis Decays audio dramas produced by Big Finish and appeared in the webcast Death Comes to Time. Head had auditioned for the role of the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 Doctor Who television movie. Head narrates series 3 and 4 of Doctor Who Confidential and the BBC Audio release Doctor Who: Project Who?.
Freema Agyeman's voicing of Martha Jones in the first episode of The Infinite Quest was their second televised appearance in the role, airing two days after their first appearance in the main series.
One of Australia's major publishers has backtracked on releasing a book detailing Chinese influence in the country -- amid threats of retaliation from Beijing, the book's author says.
Clive Hamilton, a prominent Charles Sturt University professor, said Monday that publisher Allen & Unwin dropped their book “Silent Invasion” last week over fears of “retaliation from Beijing through a number of possible avenues including legal threats, orchestrated by Beijing,” Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
“After extensive legal advice we decided to delay publication of Clive's book ‘Silent Invasion' until certain matters currently before the courts have been decided,” the publisher said in a statement.
Hamilton slammed the decision to stop the book from publishing just when it was about to hit the bookstores. “What we're seeing … is the first instance where a major Western publisher has decided to censor material of the Chinese Communist Party in its home country,” Hamilton told the public broadcaster.
“This really is a watershed in the debate over China's suppression of free speech,” they said, adding that “I think if we succumb to this in Australia then we have lost a big battle in trying to defend what we take to be fundamental rights and privileges and freedoms in this country.”
The book's focus was the Chinese Communist Party's activities in Australia and the claims made in the book have been vetted by the lawyers, according to the professor.
“The Chinese government's campaign is far more extensive than ever previously understood. If you're going to analyze how Beijing is influencing Australian society and politics you have to analyze that activity of individuals and name names, and that's what I've done,” they told the Guardian Australia.
“It's a factual book with 1,100 footnotes and it has been meticulously researched, but short of redacting 100 names from the book there's always the possibility someone might launch a vexatious legal act against the publisher, in this case Allen & Unwin.”
The author remains convinced the book in its full form will still be released, but it remains unclear when or if another publisher will risk the possible legal threat from the communist regime.
Rolling burnouts in a parking garage? Dirt-track slides through construction zones? Wheelies that would impress Travis Pastrana? What's gotten into Honda? The future of motorcycling, maybe. This is the Taiwanese-built MSX125, known as the Grom 125 in Japan. Launched overseas early this year, the MSX (Mini Street Xtreme) is rumored to be coming to the U.S. as a 2014 model.
Honda says development of the MSX125 resulted in four patent applications “focused around the split-structure tank cover and frame.” To keep the package desirably small, components for the PGM fuel injection are housed inside the cover of the 1.45-gallon gas tank. Despite scooter-size 120/70-12 front and 130/70-12 rear rubber, this entry-level machine said to use “full-size motorcycle parts.” Claimed curb weight is 224 pounds. Seat height is 30.1 inches, .4 shorter than a CBR250R.
Like the littlest CBR, the MSX125 is equipped with big-bike features, such as a projector-beam headlight, an LED taillight, a liquid-crystal-display dash and hydraulic disc brakes front and rear. Output for the air-cooled, two-valve Single is reported to be 9.7 horsepower at 7000 rpm with 8.0 foot-pounds of torque at 5500 rpm; hop-up kits, including a bigger-bore cylinder and throttle body, are already available in Japan. A four-speed transmission works in concert with chain final drive.
Larger picture? Honda is steadily stuffing its U.S. model line from the displacement basement: step-through Ruckus, Metropolitan and PCX150 scooters, dual-purpose CRF250L, CBR250R, three sporty 500cc Twins—CB500F, CB500R, CB500X—plus the modular NC700X standard and CTX700 cruisers.
Will the MSX125 be the two-wheel kick in the pants that drives today's teens to motorcycling? “Small it may be,” says Honda, “but in terms of worldwide sales, brand awareness and owner satisfaction, its impact will be large.”

Post-Communist underground stations in Moscow, like the recently completed Pyatnitskoye shosse, are still, very visibly, Moscow Metro stations. Regardless of the need or otherwise for nuclear shelters, they're still buried deep in the ground; ubiquitous still is the expensive, laborious, but highly legible and architecturally breathtaking practice of providing high-ceilinged vaults with the trains leaving from either side. There have been attempts at “normal” metro lines, like the sober stations built under Khrushchev, or the “Light Metro” finished in 2003, but they didn't catch on. Largely, the model developed in the mid-1930s continues, and not just in Moscow — extensions in Kiev or St Petersburg, or altogether new systems in Kazan or Almaty, carry on this peculiar tradition. Metro stations are still being treated as palaces of the people, over two decades after the “people's” states collapsed. This could be a question of maintaining quality control, but then quality is not conspicuous in the Russian built environment. So why does this endure?
Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station Moscow Metro station
.
The original, 1930s Moscow Metro was the place where even the most skeptical fellow travellers threw away their doubts and surrendered. Bertolt Brecht wrote an awe-filled poem on the subject, “The Moscow Workers Take Possession of the Great Metro on April 27, 1935,” dropping their habitual irony and dialectic to describe the Metro workers perusing the system they'd built on the day of its opening. At the end, the poet gasps, their guard down, “This is the grand picture that once upon a time/ rocked the writers who foresaw it” — that is, that here, at least, a dream of “Communism” had been palpably built. It was not an uncommon reaction, then or now, nostalgia notwithstanding. The first stations, those Brecht was talking about, were not particularly over-ornamented, especially by the standards of what came later, but their extreme opulence and spaciousness was still overwhelming. Stations like Sokolniki or Kropotkinskaya didn't bludgeon with classical reminisces and mosaics. Yet three things about the underground designs created by architects Alexei Dushkin, Ivan Fomin, Dmitry Chechulin et al were unprecedented in any previous public transport network, whether Charles Holden's London, Alfred Grenander's Berlin or Hector Guimard's Paris. First, the huge size of the halls, their high ceilings and widely-spaced columns; second, the quality of the materials, with various coloured marbles shipped in from all over the USSR; and third, the lighting, emerging from individually-designed, surreal chandeliers, often murkily atmospheric, designed to create mood rather than light.
Although, unlike their successors, they didn't quite go all the way towards neo-classical, neo-baroque and neo-Byzantine, they don't feel modern as such, but oddly dynastic, ecclesiastical, haunting. They are dream spaces which linger in the memory. That's even before the explicit propaganda, the statues and mosaics and majolica and stained glass, the High Stalinist style that lasts from the late Thirties to the mid-Fifties. And even these aren't just general propaganda blare, but something more complex — themed stations, stations with narratives, or in the case of the Ring, an entire line of narrative, retelling revolution, war and the Metro's own construction. After a brief toning-down under Khrushchev, new stations continued in this vein in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties, albeit with classicism exchanged for futurism, as with the astonishing Vostok Vienna Secession ballroom at Aviyamotornaya. Similar are the Brezhnev and Gorbachev-era systems in Novosibirsk, Volgograd, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara and other Soviet cities outside Russia. They share an entire, coherent aesthetic between lines and cities, all fragments of the same underground metropolis — more coherent, often, than the chaotic cities above.

It's not difficult to work out why the Metro's style was and is so popular, but it's harder to discover its sources. The dreaminess of Art Nouveau or the didactic, illustrative civic palaces of Victorian Britain may be distant cousins, but the Metro is largely a completely unique phenomenon. And unlike other, similarly grandiose Stalinist schemes, it lacks the widespread Russian tendency to use spectacular facades to mask the absence of content (known in Russia as the “Potemkin” element, in honour of Count Grigory Potemkin, a favourite of Catherine the Great who built mock villages to conceal the poverty and unpopularity of Russia's new southern colonies). The “Seven Sisters,” the ornate post-war skyscrapers built by Stalin, and the grand boulevards were expressly designed for an elite, and are frequently insubstantial and piecemeal, quickly giving way to shabbier and simpler pieces of townscape. Not so the Metro. It is what it purports to be — a public transport system raised to the status of a series of miniature palaces, aristocratic spaces for the proletariat. It's hard to see the catch, at least if you forget that from the Thirties to the Fifties, the reckless construction methods employed under Metro bosses “Iron” Lazar Kaganovich and their deputy, and future Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev cost scores of lives.
The Metro persists as a deeply official yet unproclaimed continuous artwork. Given that most of the new stations and the extensions under construction were planned under the USSR it is in the applied art, rather than in the architecture, that you find the differences with Soviet practice. Park Pobedy, in 2003, was the Metro's equivalent of the neo-Stalinist trend in architecture, with red marble and murals by Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's favourite artist Zurab Tsereteli depicting the victories over Napoleon and Hitler — a vacuous version of the USSR's more architecturally imaginative hurrah-patriotism. Other 1990s stations seem to sit halfway between optimistic late-Soviet futurism and something more ambiguous. Rimskaya, for instance, is in its main hall another science-fiction hangar, but examine its sculptures and you find babies atop collapsed columns, allegedly a reference to Romulus and Remus, but with an obvious pertinence to a more recently collapsed empire. Much more coherent is something like the Dostoevskaya station, finished in 2010 — here we have a narrative station again, with macabre little illustrations of scenes from Dostoevsky's novels, executed by artist Ivan Nikolayev in a creepy, cartoonish style far from Tsereteli's clumsy heroics. As if as a joke at the authoritarianism behind the Metro, a looming portrait of the author themselves stares out at the commuter at the end of one of the vaults. Today maybe, it's still as Brecht wrote in 1935, where “men, women and children, greybeards as well/ turned to the stations, beaming as if at the theatre.” But whether we can say, as they did, that the Metro's “builders are the proprietors” is another matter.

News media narratives tend to group horse-race developments into one of the three basic categories: win, lose, or draw. Sometimes, however, a political event falls into the awkward middle ground between those realms.
Thursday night's vice-presidential debate in Danville, Ky., is a potential example of this. Instant polls conducted after the debate are suggestive of something between a tie and a modest win for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
A CBS News-Knowledge Networks poll of undecided voters who watched the debate found 50 percent giving the advantage to Mr. Biden, 31 percent to the Republican, Representative Paul D. Ryan, and 19 percent calling the debate a tie.
A CNN poll of debate-watchers, however, had 48 percent giving the debate to Mr. Ryan, and 44 percent to Mr. Biden.
The surveys are not directly comparable: the CBS News poll was conducted among undecided voters only, while the CNN poll was among all debate viewers. But it might be noted that Mr. Biden's margin in the CBS News poll was somewhat larger than Mr. Ryan's in the CNN survey, which was within the poll's margin of sampling error.
The social media sentiment during the debate also seemed to flow along these lines. The liberals in my Twitter feed seemed a bit more satisfied with Mr. Biden's performance than the conservatives were with Mr. Ryan's, but it wasn't a slam dunk.
Vice-presidential debates rarely move head-to-head numbers between the presidential candidates – even when there is a much clearer verdict in instant-reaction polls. So one should err on the side of caution in assuming that the debate had much influence either way.
There is a plausible hypothesis, however, that some of Mr. Romney's recent surge in the polls reflects a growing “enthusiasm gap” between Democrats and Republicans. To the extent that Mr. Biden's performance re-energized Democratic partisans, they may have left President Obama in a slightly better position than where they started the night.
Another hypothesis, not necessarily unrelated to the prior one, is that some of Mr. Romney's gains in the polls are momentum-driven, and could include some soft support that might come up for grabs again once the news cycle turns over. We'll have to wait and see how long the vice-presidential debate leads the news, as opposed to Mr. Obama's poorly-reviewed performance last week in Denver.
The conventional wisdom about debates also sometimes evolves in a way that differs from the initial reaction to them. Instant polls of the first presidential debate in 2000 showed a modest lead for then-Vice President Al Gore — but it was their opponent, George W. Bush, who made gains in head-to-head polls after there was criticism of Mr. Gore's demeanor.
My best guess: perhaps Mr. Biden can be credited with what in baseball statistics would be termed a “hold”: something a bit shy of either a win or a save and which will probably seem perfunctory with the passage of time, but which might have done their team a bit of good.
However, they won't have relieved Mr. Obama of the burden of needing to improve their performance in next week's presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y.
The Washington Redskins is "disparaging to Native Americas," according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office which canceled six federal trademark registrations this week.
View the full opinion here.
"The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board agreed with our clients that the team's name and trademarks disparage Native Americans. The Board ruled that the Trademark Office should never have registered these trademarks in the first place," said Jesse Witten, attorney for Amanda Blackhorse, who brought the case against the team.
"It is a great victory for Native Americans and for all Americans. We filed our petition eight years ago and it has been a tough battle ever since. I hope this ruling brings us a step closer to that inevitable day when the name of the Washington football team will be changed," Blackhorse said. "The team's name is racist and derogatory. I've said it before and I will say it again – if people wouldn't dare call a Native American a 'redskin' because they know it is offensive, how can an NFL football team have this name?"
The decision means that the team can continue to use the Redskins name, but it would lose a significant portion of its ability to protect the financial interests connected to its use. If others printed the name on sweatshirts, apparel, or other team material, it becomes more difficult to go after groups who use it without permission, according to the Associated Press.
The ruling only applies to the Redskins name, not the team's logo.
Is it time for a decision like this for the Cleveland Indians Chief Wahoo name and logo?
For the last 21 years, Native Americans and supporters have protested the use of the Cleveland Indians team name and the club's Chief Wahoo logo at early season home baseball games.
"Colleges and high schools around the country have done the right thing and dropped names of sports teams that are demeaning to indigenous people," Ferne Clements, of the 500 Years committee, previously said. "We want our hometown team to do the same. We're not just being politically correct here, this is morally wrong."
"We truly believe it is an individual perception issue," Bob DiBiasio, spokesperson for the Cleveland Indians, previously said. "When people look at our logo, we believe they think baseball. We have added a logo, the block C, recently in addition to the Wahoo logo and the script 'Indians.' Fans of the team have alternative ways to express their support."

IN 1998, John Shelby Spong, then the reliably controversial Episcopal bishop of Newark, published a book entitled “Why Christianity Must Change or Die.” Spong was a uniquely radical figure — during their career, they dismissed almost every element of traditional Christian faith as so much superstition — but most recent leaders of the Episcopal Church have shared their premise. Thus their church has spent the last several decades changing and then changing some more, from a sedate pillar of the WASP establishment into one of the most self-consciously progressive Christian bodies in the United States .
As a result, today the Episcopal Church looks roughly how Roman Catholicism would look if Pope Benedict XVI suddenly adopted every reform ever urged on the Vatican by liberal pundits and theologians. It still has priests and bishops, altars and stained-glass windows. But it is flexible to the point of indifference on dogma, friendly to sexual liberation in almost every form, willing to blend Christianity with other faiths, and eager to downplay theology entirely in favor of secular political causes.
Yet instead of attracting a younger, more open-minded demographic with these changes, the Episcopal Church's dying has proceeded apace. Last week, while the church's House of Bishops was approving a rite to bless same-sex unions, Episcopalian church attendance figures for 2000-10 circulated in the religion blogosphere. They showed something between a decline and a collapse: In the last decade, average Sunday attendance dropped 23 percent, and not a single Episcopal diocese in the country saw churchgoing increase.
This decline is the latest chapter in a story dating to the 1960s. The trends unleashed in that era — not only the sexual revolution, but also consumerism and materialism, multiculturalism and relativism — threw all of American Christianity into crisis, and ushered in decades of debate over how to keep the nation's churches relevant and vital.

Traditional believers, both Protestant and Catholic, have not necessarily thrived in this environment. The most successful Christian bodies have often been politically conservative but theologically shallow, preaching a gospel of health and wealth rather than the full New Testament message.

But if conservative Christianity has often been compromised, liberal Christianity has simply collapsed. Practically every denomination — Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian — that has tried to adapt itself to contemporary liberal values has seen an Episcopal-style plunge in church attendance. Within the Catholic Church, too, the most progressive-minded religious orders have often failed to generate the vocations necessary to sustain themselves.

Many others were skeptical of Kushner's implication that they had not known what the meeting was supposed to be about prior to attending it.
“That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at their office,” Kushner wrote. “Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as ‘Meeting: Don Jr. | Jared Kushner.' No one else was mentioned.”
Some people on Twitter were quick to point out that Kushner wouldn't have needed to read the full email chain, as the subject line was: “FW: Russia – Clinton – private and confidential.”

A 10-year-old boy has died after suffering serious head injuries in an "incident involving store furniture".
They were taken to hospital after being injured at 16:15 GMT in the Topshop store in the Oracle Shopping Centre, Reading.
The boy, who was in a life threatening condition, died later at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Thames Valley Police said.
Their death is being treated as unexplained but non-suspicious.
Image copyright Ryan Sheehan Image caption Thames Valley Police said further enquiries would take place
South Central Ambulance said three ambulances and two officers in a rapid response vehicle were sent to the scene and the shop was cordoned off to customers.
Police said the boy's next of kin had been informed and that further enquiries would take place.
(Natural News) They often say that art imitates life and that, sadly, never seems truer than when it comes to science fiction. Despite the fact that most stories in the genre are otherworldly, time has shown that writers and filmmakers are never all that far off when it comes to predicting the future. The latest example of a science-fiction story resembling real-life far too closely is Incorporated — a new TV series on the Syfy channel that finds the United States being run completely by corporations in the not-too-distant future.
Chuck Barney of The Mercury News reports, “Set in 2074, ‘Incorporated' (10 p.m. Wednesdays, Syfy) imagines a world where many countries have gone bankrupt after a rash of calamities. In the absence of effective government, mighty corporations have become de-facto governments. A small sliver of the population lives in luxury, while most people live in squalor and fear.”
While this subject has been a major plot point in many fictional stories throughout the years, it has never been more timely than in 2017. Thanks to the globalist empire that looks to create a singular, world government, corporations like Monsanto are stronger than ever. While there are plenty of patriots and freedom-loving folks who are trying their hardest to prevent this takeover from manifesting, the powers that be are not going down without a fight. We saw this happen very recently with Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Of course, the people spoke and Donald Trump was elected, but it was an extremely close race.
We came dangerously close to having President Hillary Clinton, which certainly would have meant having a Monsanto-backed leader of the free world. In a lot of ways, the corporations would have been running our country. Clinton merely would have been a figurehead. So while Incorporated may be a fictional television show, reality isn't too far off. (RELATED: For more news regarding a potential societal collapse, visit Collapse.news)
Even star Dennis Haysbert believes that a dystopian future could be on the horizon if our federal government doesn't divert from that potentially horrific path. Haysbert stated, “We are nose-diving into that world. I just hope it doesn't become as dystopian as the show … I think a lot of people have lost their integrity. They all drank the Kool-Aid. Let's see if it backs up on them.”
Hollywood, a lot of the time, tries to avoid subjects that paint the federal government in a negative light. Since the film industry is run by the same leftists that bowed down at the throne of President Barack Obama, they refused to create anything that could potentially make them look bad. Thankfully, it appears as though there are still some people in the entertainment industry that are willing to expose the truth and show just how corrupt the United States government has become.
While Incorporated may not be the solution to all of our problems, it could definitely help start a conversation about the direction that our country is headed — and has been headed for quite some time. If we are ever going to overcome the odds and receive true liberty in the United States, we are going to need the public at large to know that there are severe issues challenging our freedom every single day.
Though the best way would be through facts and statistics, fiction has a history of getting the point across in a much more easily digestible manner for the average person. That's what we should be doing with Incorporated and other science fiction stories of a similar nature. It may sound silly in theory, but in execution, it could very well work in our favor.

A female sergeant with nearly 20 years on the force is coming forward with claims of sexual harassment and discrimination within the Toronto Police Service, allegations detailed in a recent complaint filed to the Human Rights Tribunal on Ontario.
“I hope you don't call the (Special Investigations Unit) on my (sic) when we do the nasty,” Morris texted them on Nov. 27, 2015 according to the claim, a message sent after Morris caught wind that the SIU, Ontario's police watchdog, was probing sexual assault allegations against a colleague.
Sgt. Jessica McInnis, a 43-year-old officer who has earned accolades since joining the Toronto Police Service in 1998, alleges they were subjected to a “steady barrage of unsolicited sexist, sexual, harassing and obscene messages” by Det. Mark Morris, their former police partner and co-leader of their Criminal Investigations Bureau (CIB) team, at downtown's 14 Division.
None of the allegations has been tested at the human rights tribunal.
“Often when a woman would report a sexual assault, male officers would make comments about how they were simply after the money. If a woman had been drinking to excess prior to the incident, they would suggest that they deserved it,” McInnis alleges in their claim.
McInnis also alleges there is a “general culture of sexism” within 14 Division, an environment that discourages women targeted by sexist behaviour from coming forward, and has implications for public complainants.
At work, in front of subordinates, McInnis claims Morris undermined her, called their vulgar and demeaning names, commented on their body parts and referred to them as “Needle Dick.” Repeated complaints to them and superiors were fruitless, they allege, and damaging to their career. The complaint says a senior officer told them they should be tough enough to withstand the behaviour.
“Remember if I slapped that ass it's not a sexual assault if I say nice game. That's what we do in sports,” they added, according to the claim.
Also named as a respondent to the claim is Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders. Police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said the service will carefully review the claim and consider their response, as with any allegation.
David Butt, Morris' lawyer, said in an email Wednesday that “Detective McInnis' allegations are either false or deliberately misleading. They will be vigorously contested. Out of respect for legal processes, Detective Morris will respond in detail only in the appropriate legal forum, and at that time they will have plenty to say. Until then there is nothing close to sufficient information on the public record to permit the drawing of either informed or accurate conclusions.”
Gray could not confirm whether the claim had been received by Toronto Police as of Friday.
“Until that time comes, we will not offer specific comment on the details put forth by the officer,” they said an email Friday.
McInnis previously pleaded guilty to discreditable conduct at the Toronto police disciplinary tribunal for making an inappropriate sexual comment to a subordinate female officer in two encounters in 2012. The specifics of what McInnis said are not included in a written sentencing decision from 2014, which saw McInnis docked 20 days' pay, though the decision states they were about the subordinate officer's “personal circumstances.”
The hearing officer on that case, Supt. Debra Preston, wrote that while they did not know what was said — a deliberate choice made at the hearing to “insulate the victims” — the comments had been described as “egregious in nature.” Though both times McInnis said they had meant the comments as a joke, Preston said it would be wrong to dismiss them as such when, as a supervisor, McInnis should have known better.
However, Preston also noted that while McInnis' misconduct was serious, they had apologized, worked hard to regain their reputation, and had an unblemished service record during the 14 years prior.
McInnis' 15-page human rights complaint alleges there has been negative fallout from complaining about Morris' conduct. They claim they were subjected to unwarranted investigations into their police work by superiors seeking to charge them with professional misconduct.
McInnis' lawyer describes them as a police officer who consistently exceeds expectations. But at the same time, “she has an ongoing fear that they will be the target of further reprisals, and this constantly causes their stress,” said Barry Swadron, who is representing McInnis alongside Marshall Swadron and Lisa Leinveer.
Appended to the claim are over 100 text messages or group chats through messaging app WhatsApp that McInnis alleges were sent to them between February 2015 and March 2017. The messages — the bulk of them alleged to be from Morris — include sexual comments about McInnis and themselves and images or videos of partially or fully naked women and men, according to the complaint.
Throughout the messages, Morris repeatedly refers to their genitalia as ‘Anaconda,' according to the appended text. In one message, they say they would describe themselves as “quiet, reserved, calculating and horny.” In one instance, Morris is alleged to have shared an Islamophobic joke about women who wear niqabs.
McInnis' claim also includes messages in “The Dream Team” chat, a group comprised of current and former members of one of 14 Divisions CIB teams. It includes a mix of sexually explicit images and at times refers specifically to McInnis in degrading terms.
In one group message, a member is alleged to have posted a photo of a woman in black underwear with the caption “Black Panties Matter.” In another, an officer shares an image of “a man's perfect remote” which includes buttons that say: “Remove clothes,” “PMS off,” “Stop nagging,” “Stop Whining,” “Boobs,” and “Sex/Food/Beer.”
In the claim, McInnis says that on some occasions they felt pressured to respond positively to Morris' behaviour “in order to fit into the culture of 14 Division and maintain working relationships.”
According to the claim, McInnis complained to Morris and superiors about their behaviour. In one incident, Morris is alleged to have become extremely upset with McInnis after they were ordered to investigate their friend, a fellow Toronto police officer, concerning sexual assault allegations.
After that officer was arrested, McInnis alleges that Morris began screaming at them in front of colleagues, banging on their desk, throwing things and calling them a “f—king rat” and that they were going to “get kicked out.” When they reported the behaviour to Toronto police Det.-Sgt. Laurie Jackson, they were told to “suck it up, you are a detective now,” according to the claim.
Jackson, who is named as a respondent in the human rights claim, could not be reached for comment.
McInnis' claim says they feared confronting Morris about their inappropriate texts because of their aggression toward them When they later did, Morris agreed to stop sending sexual messages — only to send them a link about National No-Bra Day four days later, the complaint states.
McInnis' complaint alleges Morris “made it clear to me that they enjoyed institutional protection for their discriminatory and harassing behaviour.”
The situation became unbearable in March 2017, the claim states, when McInnis was interviewed by a member of Toronto police's Professional Standards unit after questions arose about how a sexual assault investigation was conducted by officers at 14 Division. Although they had no choice but to speak with the officer, McInnis claims Morris became angry with them like never before and alleges in the claim that they lunged at them with clenched fists; they were fearful that they would hit her, the claim says.
That night, McInnis asked their bosses to have Morris be removed from the workplace, but according to the claim, Jackson said: “Oh honey it was just an argument.” McInnis went on sick leave for a week.
When they returned they were told they were being placed in an administrative role and advised of the first of several investigations into their police work that they say were unwarranted, including the complaint that they had written a date down wrong in a memo book, according to the claim.
They requested a transfer from 14 Division and in May moved to a different division.
As a result of McInnis' complaint, Morris is under investigation by Toronto police professional standards, according to the claim. In October, McInnis was advised that they had become a subject officer in the investigation their complaint about Morris had initiated — meaning she, too, is under investigation.
McInnis' claim also alleges that throughout their policing career, they have experienced bullying and harassment, including an incident where a male inspector grabbed them in front of other supervisors and kissed them on the lips. In another example, a male instructor told them they “dressed like a slut.”
“I have also learned from other women in the TPS of the serious and ongoing sexual harassment and discrimination they have experienced at work. When they finally came forward, the TPS did not support them, but instead permitted reprisals to be brought against them and made their work experience unbearable,” McInnis writes in the complaint.
Indeed, in one exchange on the “Dream Team” group message, some of McInnis' colleagues bring up another female Toronto police officer who is alleging sexual harassment in the workplace. Sharing a link to a news story about Heather McWilliam's ongoing human rights tribunal hearing, Morris, who says they trained McWilliam for six months, said: “I knew they were a little odd but this? I don't know.”
They went on to say that “they called them ms piggy and they were not my type.”
“R vs anaconda coming soon lol,” replied another member in the group chat, apparently joking that Morris was going to be charged, using the nomenclature of criminal court cases.
McInnis' claim includes a number of requested remedies, including human rights training for supervisory staff at 14 Division; that Toronto police conduct regular audits to probe workplace sexual harassment; and that the service establish policies to address any barriers employees face in reporting harassment.  They are also seeking just over $600,000 in damages and reimbursements for lost income.
Excerpts of sexual text messages
Sgt. Jessica McInnis' complaint to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario includes a 15-page list of the sexual and inappropriate messages they were allegedly sent by their then-police partner, Det. Mark Morris.
Also included are group messages from “The Dream Team,” a group of Toronto police officers currently or formerly within Toronto police 14 Division. Below are some of the messages alleged to have been received by McInnis.
May 24, 2015: When McInnis texts Morris about a missing Black man, they respond by sending them a photograph of a naked black man with a large penis.
April 1, 2016: (Chatting about how “The Dream Team” is group message that everyone can see). Morris: “Soo what you are saying is that everyone can see and read the text right? Cause (McInnis) sometimes may want to send me nudes. I will let them know not to do this and keep it professional only.” Another officer replied: “Lol! Ya every one can see these msgs. So make sure they send it to u directly.”
June 1, 2016: Morris sends “The Dream Team” group chat an image of a naked Black man dragging a large penis on the ground. “That one is McInnis' favourite one,” Morris wrote.
September 15, 2016: Morris a photo to McInnis of a woman with large buttocks and a caption that said scientists have found that woman with bigger butts have smarter children. “Hmmmm…. i guess if you had kids…. they would be geniuses,” Morris wrote.
October 20, 2016: Morris sends the “Dream Team” group a video of a woman dancing with part of their buttocks exposed. When one officer says “Nice. Who is that?” Morris says: “It's the black Jessica McInnis. I'd tap that.” The other officer responds: “Lol ya I would too haha.”
It's taken awhile, but LeBron James finally sounds like a guy who believes they can be one of the greatest basketball players of all time. After winning two championships, that sort of thing will happen. There was never any question about James' physical abilities, it was always just a question of whether they were mentally tough enough. But after a decade in the league and four MVPs, there's no question that James is mentally tough. He's in their prime now and the only question remaining is how great their legacy will be.
So where does James think he'll end up when it's all said and done? On basketball's hypothetical Mt. Rushmore.
Here's what James told Steve Smith in an interview for NBA TV:
“I'm going to be one of the top four that's ever played this game, for sure. And if they don't want me to have one of those top four spots, they'd better find another spot on that mountain. Somebody's gotta get bumped, but that's not for me to decide. That's for the architects.”
So who's on James' Mt. Rushmore right now? Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Oscar Robertson. They apparently had to think hard on the fourth choice.
To me, I don't see how they could have left Julius Erving off the mountain. People don't realize the impact they had on the game. Do yourself a favor and watch the Dr. J documentary that NBA TV did a couple years back. Watch that and you'll conclude that it's just wrong to leave the Doctor off basketball's Mt. Rushmore.
But getting back to James, is it possible? Could they work their way into the top four or higher someday? Sure they could. But I don't think it's likely. James is destined to be a top 10 player in my book. Unless they win an unprecedented amount of MVPs or they win six or seven titles, I just don't see a way they can move ahead of Bird, Magic, Jordan or Dr. J.
All of those guys changed the game forever. James is simply the greatest player of their generation. Have they done anything revolutionary? Not in my book. Not yet, anyway.

Spruce tip beer is, in one form or another, a very old style of beer. Back in Colonial times, hops were rare, so the colonists made a beer with molasses and used spruce or fir tips in place of the hops. This is not that beer.
This is a modern interpretation of a spruce or fir tip beer that is a rich amber ale with enough hops to give it backbone — and lots of fir tips, which lend a balsamic, citrusy flavor.
It is a wonderful beer to drink in a tulip glass, as you get all those amazing aromas full on; it's like drinking with Vikings in the Northwoods.
What is a spruce tip? The brand new springtime growth of spruce, fir, redwoods, pines and other conifer trees is a pretty pale green. At first they are little compressed bullet-like structures, but as they mature they begin to look just like older growth, only lighter in color. You can use them at any point, and can even use older growth if you must, but the older the needles get the less citrusy and more turpentine-like they become.
Note that when I say springtime, I mean spring where the tree is. Where I live in Northern California, I can get the new growth of fir trees all the way into August, depending on how high I go. I picked some lovely Engelmann spruce tips in Arizona in late July. My advice is to gather a lot, vacuum seal them and freeze so you can make this beer all year 'round.
As for the foraging part, taste test many different trees, as each one will be slightly different. Then, when you find one you like, pick from that one — but not too much, as you don't want to hurt the tree. And never, ever pick the growing tops of small trees. You will stunt them.
My main advice with this recipe is to age the beer a month or more in the bottles. It starts out harsh and bitter, but mellows wonderfully after a month and will continue to smooth out over time.
To make a fir tip or spruce tip ale, you need to be set up for brewing. If you are, you're good to go. If you're not, there is substantial equipment you really do need to do this right. At a minimum, you will need:
A large pot, or several slightly smaller ones. I used a regular stockpot plus another soup pot before I got a proper brewing kettle.
A thermometer. I highly recommend a laser thermometer. I use this one .
. A gram scales. Yep, precision matters in beer making. This is the scale I use.
I use. Something to ferment in. I prefer glass carboys, which are large jugs, but some people prefer buckets.
An airlock. You need to keep air off the fermenting beer at the same time you let CO2 escape. The airlock does the trick.
A strainer. A fine-meshed strainer removes debris, called trub, and the stray bits of seasoning and hops.
Sanitizer. Yes, you need it. There are any number of good ones out there, but I use either Iodophor or Star-San.
or Star-San. Bottles, caps and a capper , or a kegging system.
And, of course, you need malt and hops and yeast. Your nearest homebrew store will have all of this stuff, or you can buy it online.
I chose to make the beer rather dark because that's what I wanted. But if you would rather make this a pale ale, add the extracts late in the process (they darken as they boil) or just go with a lighter grain bill. I chose the Northern Brewer and Saaz hops because I wanted something to play backup to the spruce tips, and because Northern Brewer's flavor is pretty piney to begin with. They play nice together.
Here are the estimated stats on this recipe:
Estimated Alcohol by Volume (ABV): 6%
IBUs: 52, but the spruce tips will add hoplike bitterness and aromas to this
Original Gravity and Final Gravity: 1.064, going down to 1.018
Print Fir or Spruce Tip Ale Prep Time 1 hr 30 mins Cook Time 1 hr Total Time 2 hrs 30 mins Fir and spruce are different plants, and have slightly different flavors, but both are citrusy, piney and, in high doses, bitter. Either works. You could experiment with chopped pine needles or juniper branches, too. This beer is pretty "hoppy," and I use quotation marks because some of that will come from the spruce or fir tips. Hard to determine exactly what the IBUs will be, but it'll be more than the 52 listed here. You can of course reduce the hops addition if you want a less pungent brew. Course: Drinks Cuisine: American Serves : 3 gallons Author : Hank Shaw Ingredients 40 ounces dry light malt extract (50%)
12 ounces dry wheat malt extract (15%)
1 cup liquid Munich extract, about 1 pound (20%)
12 ounces pale crystal malt, cracked (15%)
20 grams Northern Brewer hops, added at 60 minutes to go in the boil
10 grams Saaz hops, added at 30 minutes to go
35 grams fresh fir or spruce tips, added at 30 minutes to go
1 Whirlfloc tablet, added at 10 minutes to go (helps clarify beer)
15 grams Northern Brewer hops, added at knockout
85 grams fresh fir or spruce tips, added at knockout
White Labs Scottish Ale yeast Instructions Steep the crystal malt. Put the crystal malt into a grain bag or tie it up loosely in cheesecloth and cover it with 2 quarts of water. Bring this to 150°F to 155°F over medium heat and hold it at this temperature for 1 hour. Remove the bag and set it over the pot in a strainer. Pour 2 quarts of water heated to 170°F over it to rinse the grain. Let the bag drain for 10 minutes, then remove. Discard the grain or feed it to animals. Start the boil. Add 3 more gallons of water to the pot and bring this to a boil. As the water heats up, stir in all three extracts, making sure there are no lumps. When you reach a boil, add the hops and set the timer for 1 hour. Add your first hops. Add fir tips and hops. With 30 minutes to go, add more hops and your first addition of spruce or fir tips. Whirlfloc and chiller. If you are using it, add the Whirlfloc to the boil along with the wort chiller, if you have one. This allows it to sanitize. Knockout. Turn off the heat and add the final addition of hops and spruce or fir tips. Crash chill the wort. Use your wort chiller to chill the wort back to 75°F or cooler, depending on how warm your tap water is. Or, put the pot in a cooler with lots of ice water in it. Use a clean metal spoon to create a whirlpool in the wort, which will help it chill faster. Hopefully you will see gnarly bits in the wort that look like egg drop soup, or separating miso in soup: That's cold crash trub, and seeing it means you will have a clearer beer. Move the wort to the fermentor. Add the Scottish ale yeast to the fermentor; I use a glass carboy. Pour the contents of the pot through a sanitized strainer into the fermentor. If the strainer gets all gunked up with trub, remove it before continuing. Put a sanitized airlock on the fermentor and put the beer in a place where it can ferment cool, ideally 66°F to 69°F. Leave it there for 1 week to 10 days. Rack the beer to a secondary. If there is a lot of gunk in the fermentor, rack the beer from the primary fermentor to a sanitized secondary fermentor -- this one needs to be a glass carboy. I do this only if there is a lot of crud in the fermentor. Either way, let the beer finish fermenting for 1 more week. Bottle or keg the beer. If you are bottling, you want to add enough priming sugar to the batch to get about 2.4 volumes of CO2, about 2 1/2 ounces or 72 grams for 3 gallons. Bottle condition 2 weeks before opening the first bottle. This beer ages well. I like the mix of Scottish ale yeast with this beer, but any subdued ale yeast is fine. Avoid Belgian yeasts.

Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Max Payne 3 and Grand Theft Auto V parent company Take-Two Interactive, is not worried about the fact that the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are not backwards compatible.
"I don't see it as a problem at all," Zelnick said today during the Credit Suisse 2013 Annual Technology Conference. "I don't think backwards compatibility affects consumers at all."
Zelnick said gamers who want to continue to play their Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 games can simply keep their existing consoles and use an input switch. It's "no big deal," they said. Their comments match up with what former Xbox executive Don Mattrick said during E3 in June.
At the time, Mattrick claimed that only 5 percent of gamers play past-generation titles on new machines. Thus, it would not make sense to invest time and resources into creating technology to allow gamers to play older games on Xbox One, they said.
"If you're backwards compatible, you're really backwards," they said at the time.
Though the Xbox One and PS4 do not support Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 physical discs, Microsoft has said its cloud servers are capable of streaming full games, while Sony has confirmed users can stream PS3 titles on PS4 through Gaikai beginning in 2014.

By re-signing Carl Pavano to a two-year, $16.5 million deal the Twins created a rotation logjam with six starters for five spots and today they announced that Scott Baker will be the No. 5 guy, leaving Kevin Slowey bullpen bound as the odd man out.
Baker and Slowey both significantly out-performed Nick Blackburn last season and have similar, if not superior, career marks, yet manager Ron Gardenhire awarded Blackburn their rotation spot weeks ago. As for Baker getting the nod over Slowey, that's definitely not a surprise.
Not only was Baker the Opening Day starter last season, he's been a full-time member of the Twins' rotation since 2007 while posting an ERA below 4.50 in each of those seasons. Oh, and he's also owed $11.5 million for this season and next, whereas Slowey will get $2.7 million this year with no long-term commitment from the Twins.
All of which isn't to say Slowey deserves a demotion to the bullpen. They haven't been very durable in three full seasons with the Twins, tossing a career-high 160 innings in 2008, but a 4.42 ERA in 82 career starts makes them a perfectly solid mid-rotation guy. There's been speculation about the Twins souring on Slowey on and off the field for a while now, and my sense is that they'd love to trade them for an impact reliever. In the meantime they'll hope they can contribute out of the bullpen while serving as insurance should injuries strike or Blackburn bomb again.

The investigation of debit- and credit-card fraud involving Bashas' customers is part of a larger scheme involving account charges made in several states and multiple countries, officials said Tuesday.
Tuesday, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said more than 400 cases of fraudulent use have been reported since Jan. 18. Investigators determined the purchases were made from Bashas', AJ's Fine Foods and Food City grocery stores, said Tim Gaffney, a spokesperson for the Pinal County Sheriff's Office.
Charges to victim's accounts have occurred in states including Texas, Illinois and New York and from countries including Italy, Canada and Mexico, Gaffney said.
The FBI is investigating along with federal, city and state authorities,
Bashas' stores, which had a cyber-attack in June or July 2012, are encouraging customers to closely monitor their debit- and credit-card transactions following a cyberattack on the stores' online systems, which provided criminals with access to customer payment information.
Bashas' located and removed a highly-sophisticated piece of malware from its systems, said Kristy Jozwiak, a spokesperson for Bashas'.
Victims have been limited to Lake Havasu City and Pinal County, but all customers are being warned to check their transactions, they said.
Forensic specialists and federal law enforcement officials have begun an investigation into the cyberattack to find those responsible, Jozwiak added.
Jozwiak said they believe the cyberattack is connected to recent investigations into credit-card fraud by the Lake Havasu City Police Department and the Pinal County Sheriff's Office.
Bashas' has installed additional security measures to protect customers' personal information from attacks in the future, Jozwiak said.
More information will be provided to customers as it is discovered, they said.
Lake Havasu City police and the Pinal County Sheriff's Office have been warning residents about credit-card fraud after a spike in fraudulent transactions during the past couple weeks, authorities said.
More than 200 cases are seemingly connected with nearly 100 reports coming in during the weekend, said Lake Havasu police Sgt. Troy Stirling. They said many of the cases appear to stem from local Bashas' and Food City stores.
The Pinal County Sheriff's Office issued a news release Jan. 30 indicating that more than 150 cases of credit-card fraud had come in since Jan. 18. According to the release, the fraudulent transactions are taking place outside of Arizona and as far as France, Italy, Canada and Mexico.

Ottawa has announced new provisions Tuesday to ensure the oil industry is responsible for cleaning up spills during offshore drilling and commercial production.
New measures — expected to be introduced this fall in Parliament and the legislatures of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland — will increase liability and transparency.
The changes will leave operators with unlimited liability when they're at fault. Even where there is no proof of fault or negligence, operators will now be responsible for up to $1 billion in clean-up costs. That's up from the current provision of $30 million.
Operators also have to make $100 million available to offshore regulators and have financial assets of at least $1 billion. Another proposed change will require the public disclosure of emergency plans and environmental monitoring reports.
Currently the information is secret.
The changes were announced Tuesday morning at a ceremony in Halifax. Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver also announced that liability in the Arctic will increase to $1 billion from $40 million.
Oliver said the move is aimed at aligning Canada's accountability regime with current international standards in the event of an oil spill.
Mastering new technology is key to keeping our country safe. That can't happen without keeping innovative, foreign-born minds inside our borders. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)
Encouraging bright minds to stay in the United States after graduation, grow businesses and create jobs is critical to secure our country's position as a high-tech hub and global leader in innovation. It's also important to our national security.
Recently, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel proposed military spending cuts that would reduce the size of the U.S. Army to pre-World War II levels, while investing in new technologies, saying, “We must maintain our technological edge over potential adversaries.” Many of the tools we need to keep our country safe are born of the minds of tech innovators. But political leaders appear to have given little thought to the national security ramifications of inaction on this issue. It's time for our politicians to drop their protectionist rhetoric and allow those who come to the United States to study and earn graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields to stay, grow businesses and create.
Our nation's defense capabilities are increasingly dependent on the latest advances in science and technology. Too often we take for granted that the United States has the world's most sophisticated communications, weaponry and aerospace technology and equipment. When we lose STEM students, we lose access to their future innovations. Sending top STEM talent away based on outdated immigration laws may actually be putting us in danger.
President Obama has repeatedly stressed the need to allow foreign graduate students who get STEM degrees in the United States to stay here and become citizens. But they insist that any action be tied to comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans agree on the need to grant citizenship to U.S.-educated STEM immigrants, but disagree with Democrats on both the importance and details of comprehensive immigration reform.
Despite these differences, last June the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation by a vote of 68-32. The legislation included provisions allowing immigrants with advanced STEM degrees to become U.S. citizens. Yet the legislation now languishes in the House. Republicans are concerned about leaving enforcement of overall immigration legislation to a president they feel selectively enforces laws. More, they fear Tea Party retribution if they act to solve one of the nation's biggest problems. Perhaps the stalemate would end if both parties considered how continued deportation of STEM graduate students will cripple our national security?
A 2013 National Foundation for American Policy study found that as many as 70 percent of students in some key STEM university graduate programs in the United States are foreign-born. Much of the $6 billion in taxpayer money given by the National Science Foundation to STEM research in U.S. universities each year is spent on research conducted by these foreign students. And a 2012 Congressional Research Service study found that the ranks of foreign-born grad students in the United States are multiplying: In 1990 we had just over 91,000 foreign graduate students, while in 2009 we hosted almost 149,000 foreign graduate students studying in the United States.
Our country is investing a significant amount of taxpayer money into foreign-born students and their research, yet once they graduate, we kick them out of the country. Meanwhile, STEM graduates who are U.S. citizens are typically drawn to Silicon Valley, big companies, start-ups or academic institutions. This leaves a huge gap in national defense, where the need for STEM expertise is arguably greatest.
International defense contractor BAE's outgoing U.S. CEO Linda Hudson recently spoke about immigration reform and the defense industry's hiring problem. “For the most part, in defense we are not permitted to hire foreign nationals,” they said. “I cannot help but wonder if hobbling our ability to hire top scientists, mathematicians, programmers, and engineers who happen to have been born on foreign soil doesn't carry national security risks of its own.” Hudson has been an outspoken proponent of the benefits of immigration reform, arguing for a path to citizenship for foreign students who want to stay and work in the United States.
We cannot let politics block action critical to preserving our national defense. Congress must act, and do so quickly. We must encourage foreign students getting STEM graduate degrees from our best universities to stay here, providing them a quick pathway to citizenship. More, we have to establish mechanisms so these bright minds are able to get the necessary security clearance to work in the U.S. defense industry.
The security and future of our nation depend on a strong military, one that leads the world in technological capability. Yet unless we open our eyes and figure out a way to utilize the talent we do have, we lack the incoming human capital to maintain our edge. It is past time for the House to pass immigration reform and get our country back on track. This isn't simply an economic issue – our national defense depends on it.

Odell Beckham Jr. stepped outside the realm of possibility Sunday night.
The New York Giants rookie made the catch of the year in prime time, beating Dallas Cowboys cornerback Brandon Carr and grabbing an Eli Manning pass with one hand like a double-decker taco.
Simply put, Beckham's catch stunned a nation of fans, who eventually remembered to breathe and then immediately fired up Photoshop.
The following are the best memes of Beckham catching things.
ESPN sideline reporter Sam Ponder also recreated the moment with the help of their child. Babies with gloves!
If the pictures don't tell the story, the praise Beckham received after the game from their opponents might give you an idea of how ridiculous the play was.
"Man's a monster," Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant told reporters, via the New York Post's Zach Braziller.
Bryant elaborated: "That catch is outstanding. ... You got to give it to him, for real. ... Hat's off to him. I respect playmakers and he's a playmaker."
Of course, the Giants would honor Beckham's performance by folding and losing 31-28.

TRENTON -- The private gaming joint venture that operates New Jersey's lottery received a more than $30 million bonus despite having originally over-promised a billion dollars in revenue at the start of its contract, its latest annual report shows.
Northstar New Jersey, which oversees Powerball, MegaMillions as well as various scratch off games, was paid a $30.6 million incentive for reaching contractual obligations that were renegotiated downward in February to more easily attainable goals.
At the urging of Gov. Chris Christie in 2012, the state entered into a 15-year contract with Northstar under which the gaming venture committed to sending "at least" $1.42 billion in additional income back to New Jersey in exchange for its making an upfront payment of $120 million in 2013. Northstar was the only bidder on the contract.
That agreement was short-lived, however.
After Northstar fell short of its promised income targets two years in a row, it renegotiated its contract with the state. In Feb. 2016, the company's financial targets were lowered by $1 billion through 2029, about $76 million less a year.
In 2013, Northstar had been forced to tap into a $20 million reserve established at the outset of its contract with New Jersey to pay for its shortage penalties.
But because 2016 produced an unexpected surge in ticket sales -- more than $3.29 billion through June -- the conglomerate was able to finally reach its renegotiated contractual obligations, according to its 2016 annual report, which runs through New Jersey's fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.
Lawmakers demand to know what's ailing N.J. state lottery
Northstar, a joint venture made up of lottery operators GTECH and Scientific Games along with the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, was also paid $104 million for "management and system fees" as well as advertising and marketing costs, the report said.
The state gets back $987 million, or 30 percent of the $3.29 billion in 2016 ticket sales, the absolute minimum required by law.
"Record-breaking sales enabled the Lottery to make a record-breaking contribution to its beneficiaries," Carole Hedinger, the lottery's executive director, said in a statement released to media.
"The Lottery could not have achieved those goals without investments made by Northstar New Jersey in technology, marketing, personnel, retailer expansion and capital equipment," said Will Rijksen, director of communications with the state's Treasury.
Rijksen also noted that after Northstar's contract was renegotiated, its bonus shrank to 3 percent of net income, down from 5 percent. Doing so, Rijksen said, ensured "that Northstar would not receive a windfall if (ticket) sales turned up dramatically."
Much of the 2016 windfall was the result of greater public interest in Powerball, which had its first billion-dollar jackpot this year, resulting in $93 million more in tickets sold that had been budgeted, according to the annual report.
But William Weld, the two-time governor of Massachusetts who's previously served as national co-chairperson of the U.S. Privatization Council wrote a recent op-ed in Forbes that "even as a long-time proponent of private management, I am constrained to say that the results obtained by private managers in Illinois and New Jersey have been a disappointment."
An email to Northstar officials requesting comment was not immediately returned, and there was no answer at the telephone number for its Princeton headquarters.
