Nektar Data Systems will assist the City of New York Parks Department to monitor and report on events and tasks for tens of thousands of trees planted as part of the City's MillionTreesNYC environmental initiative. The New York City Parks department required a cloud-based mobile data collection system to quantify the contractual requirements for tree planting and maintenance work as completed by contractors hired within the program.
With the thousands of trees and the obvious congestion and geography of New York City, the monumental task of managing the contractual obligations of the contractors have led the city to seek out a tree tracking, mapping and data collection tool. After a successful pilot, New York City has chosen Nektar Data Systems' Histree product as their choice to accomplish this feat.
Using Nektar Data Systems' Histree product, the City of New York's Parks Department will track, record and report on all contractor/tree events. This embracement of the Histree data collection solution will allow New York City parks staff to perform inspections on trees and to fully document, map and quantify exactly when and where work is being performed by contractors. The information gathered will include dynamic information such as tree inspections and assessments, pictures, date and time stamps records, as well as the exact GPS map location of each tree and event. All data will be hosted in cloud servers giving the contractors and NYC Parks administrative staff the option to add data to the data base or retrieve and view each tree's 'histree' at any time from any device. Users will also be using Histree's GPS mapping functionality to facilitate routing and scheduling processes within a single interface.
"The ability to manage a tree's well-being, directly from the field, using a smartphone or tablet will revolutionize municipally managed tree planting programs" said Nektar Data Systems President and CEO Art Maat. "It brings everyone's accountability in planning, implementing and follow-up on any green project, big or small, to the forefront," he said.

About MillionTreesNYC
MillionTreesNYC, one of the 132 PlaNYC initiatives, is a citywide, public-private program with an ambitious goal: to plant and care for one million new trees across the City's five boroughs over the next decade. By planting one million trees, New York City will increase its urban forest—its most valuable environmental asset made up of street trees, park trees, and trees on public, private and commercial land—by an astounding 20%, while achieving the many quality-of-life benefits that come with planting trees. The City of New York will plant 70% of trees in parks and other public spaces. The other 30% will come from private organizations, homeowners, and community organizations. In addition to community planting initiatives the City of New York engages with contractors to plant and maintain tens of thousands of street trees annually.

INTRODUCTION
Since the euro crisis began, many have seen the German economy as the model for the rest of Europe to emulate. In particular, the reforms of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder are credited with laying the ground work for current German economic success and global competitiveness by tackling an excessive welfare state and sclerotic labour market.
But research in a new ECFR paper by Sebastian Dullien - A German model for Europe? - suggests this argument is wrong. Sebastian says Germany's current strength comes from wage restraint and pressure on education and research and development – a formula that would harm other European economies if it was applied more widely.
The German approach has involved cuts to research and development, and to education – if this is copied elsewhere it would result in a lower rate of technological progress, harming long-term growth.
Emulating Germany's deflationary wage policy across Europe would reduce aggregate demand at a time when the EU's companies are looking for customers.
Widespread wage restraint could also lead to a mutually destructive “beggar thy neighbour” situation in Europe, with each country holding down earnings in an attempt to make their own economies more competitive.
“The German model cannot be a blueprint for Europe. Instead of trying to copy the German approach as a whole, European leaders should carefully examine which of the elements of German reforms could actually increase productivity, output, and employment without detrimental effects on the partners or on long-term growth” - Sebastian Dullien
October 2010 Reynald Temarii, president of the Oceania Football Confederation, is recorded telling Sunday Times reporters that two bids had offered "huge" payments for his support in the 2018 World Cup bidding process and that he had received offers of between $10-12 million (£7.5 million). Amos Adamu, a Fifa executive committee member from Nigeria, says he wants $800,000 (£500,000) to build four artificial football pitches, which contravenes Fifa's rules. Both men tell reporters they could facilitate access to the men who'll decide where the tournaments will be held. Adamu and Temarii are provisionally suspended from all football-related activity pending the outcome of an investigation. Sunday Times also exposed the referees committee, Ahongalu Fusimalohi and former executive committee member Ismael Bhamjee.
October 2010 Fifa president Sepp Blatter writes to all 24 executive committee members promising a full investigation into allegations. It emerges that the Spain-Portugal and Qatar bids could face expulsion from the contest for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments if the duo are found guilty of colluding. Spain-Portugal's bid leader accuses England of doing a deal with the USA in breach of Fifa regulations.
November 2010 It is reported that the Spain-Portugal and Qatar World Cup bids could escape censure over the allegations of collusion, after Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer confirms that no hard evidence had been passed to its ethics committee. Adamu is suspended for three years and fined 10,000 Swiss francs (£6,341) while Temarii is banned for a year and fined 5,000 Swiss francs (£3,170). Panel concludes there is insufficient proof of collusion between the Spain/Portugal and Qatar bids.
December 2010 English FA is humiliated as Russia is handed 2018 World Cup finals; Qatar gets the 2022 tournament. Roger Burden, acting chairman of the FA, stands down after relations between FA and Fifa descend into acrimony. Burden said he “wanted nothing more to do with them [Fifa]”. Swiss government prepares to investigate risk of corruption in sports bodies based in the country following Fifa's controversial award of the two World Cup finals.
January 2011 Documents seen by Telegraph Sport reveal that Qatar offered to relocate the headquarters of the Asian Football Confederation to Doha.
Evidence emerges of Qatar and Spain-Portugal collusion Blatter confirms that the Qatar and Spain-Portugal World Cup bids colluded to trade votes in the contest for the 2018 and 2022 finals.
May 2011 Geoff Thompson endorses Sepp Blatter's campaign to retain the Fifa presidency despite having been chairman of England's failed World Cup bid. Telegraph Sport discloses that England football officials hired a “corporate investigations” company to investigate their rivals during the failed bid to host the 2018 World Cup. Six of Fifa's executive committee are accused in Parliament of “improper and unethical behaviour” during World Cup bidding. Fifa demands the FA provide evidence to support allegations of corruption and “unethical” behaviour against six executive committee members. Blatter vows to complete the inquiry before presidential election. The FA reveal they will hold independent inquiry into Lord Triesman's allegations of corruption against four Fifa executive committee members. The FA board agrees to abstain in the forthcoming Fifa presidential election because of doubts over the probity of both Blatter and his challenger Mohamed Bin Hammam. Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid committee accuses Parliamentary committee of “insulting” behaviour as it launches attempted fight-back against allegations of corruption leveled against it. The FA call for the June 1 Fifa election to be postponed and for an independent review of the world governing body's structures.
March 2011 Reports say the FA will support any challenger to Sepp Blatter in forthcoming Fifa presidential election. Fifa presidential challenger Mohamed Bin Hammam considers striking deal with Michel Platini that would see him step aside in favour of the Uefa president after just one four-year term if he is successful in his campaign to unseat Sepp Blatter. Blatter promises to hand out $1 billion (£610,000) in “development” funds to the 208 members associations that will decide his fate as president in the forthcoming Fifa election.
May 2011 Fifa presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam says Amadou Diallo, a Guinean national accused in Parliament of facilitating bribes on behalf of Qatar's World Cup bid, is a close friend of his but not involved in any wrongdoing. Amadou Diallo, the man accused of facilitating bribes on behalf of Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid worked for Fifa for at least six years as an advisor to Mohamed Bin Hammam, the governing body confirms. It then emerges that Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, a Fifa vice-president, are to face disciplinary action for allegedly offering bribes to members of the Caribbean Football Union in exchange for votes in forthcoming election. Fifa's ethics committee suspend the pair from all football-related activity pending the outcome of a full inquiry into bribery accusations. Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke confirms that an email in which he made the sensational allegation that Qatar "bought" the 2022 World Cup is genuine after Warner, the recipient, reveals it to the press.
July 2011 The whistleblower in FIFA 2022 corruption claims, Phaedra Almajid retracts her claims. Hassan Al-Thawadi, the secretary-general of the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, dismisses bribery claims. He then outlines the nation's plans to construct air-conditioned stadiums.
December 2011 The Daily Telegraph reports that the FBI are investigating alleged hacking into email accounts for England and America's World Cup bids.
July 2012 Fifa employ American attorney Michael J. Garcia to investigate allegations of corruption in world football. A month later, Garcia declares his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar

August 2013 Blatter confirms that that the FIFA executive committee will meet to decide on when the 2022 World Cup should be held, due to Qatar's hot climate. He admits that playing the World Cup in the summer there is "not rational and reasonable''. Blatter goes onto say that Fifa made “a mistake” when appointing Qatar as the host nation for the 2022 World Cup.
June 2014 million new documents are made public by the Sunday Times, showing how bribes changed hands in order to secure Qatar the 2022 World Cup. Fifa claims it is taking the claims seriously.
September 2014 Garcia delivers his 350-page report, but Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm of FIFA's ethics committee, declares that it will not be made public for legal reasons. Instead, Eckert reveals that he will produce a summary of the report ready for public consumption by November 2014.
November 2014 Eckert makes public the 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing the Garcia's report. The summary clears both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Critics denounce Eckert's summary as ‘a whitewash', while Garcia denounces it as "materially incomplete" with "erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions". FIFA's Appeal Committee then dismiss Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary. Garcia resigns a day later, before FIFA's executive committee agree to publish a "legally appropriate version" of the Garcia report.

Bangalore: When Milind Katti, a Pune-based sales professional, was attempting to develop a software product that could potentially help enterprises manage their customers efficiently, he did not seek meetings with the usual investors that wannabe entrepreneurs chase. Instead, Katti sought the help of a friend who worked at Mu Sigma, a data analytics firm that has a valuation of around $1 billion, to get an appointment with founder Dhiraj C. Rajaram.
The idea was to seek help from somebody who knew the space well, and had real insights about developing a product to manage revenue streams from large, Fortune 100 customers.
In November 2011, when Katti first met Rajaram, Mu Sigma had less than $100 million in revenue. It counted Pfizer Inc. and Microsoft Corp. among its top customers.
“I asked him if having technology tools for account management was a key pain area for him and he asked for more details," said Katti, who has spent more than 15 years in sales.
Rajaram asked Katti to meet him at his office on a Thursday afternoon in November 2011.
After listening to the idea, Rajaram offered to put in half the money, some ₹ 20 lakh, in building a software product from scratch.
“I listened to him, and liked the idea because it addressed a genuine problem," said Rajaram.
Katti put in an equal amount and was promised access to real account management experience across different projects at Mu Sigma. A pure venture capital investor could never have matched the value offered by Mu Sigma—of learning from real-time projects and building a product alongside.
“The twist is that here the angel investor is a successful entrepreneur, allows access to validate and build the product closely at his company and deeply understands the problem we are solving through the product," said Katti.
Rajaram also introduced Katti to a dozen professionals in the industry who dealt with customer account management problems that none of the existing products solved effectively.
Katti, who had co-founded outsourcing firm QED Baton in 2000 with Abhijit Gangoli, decided to spend all the time with the new firm being incubated at Mu Sigma. In February last year, he registered a company called Demand Farm Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
“The big challenges for a start-up are idea validation, customer development, initial funding and the right advice. We were able to meet all of them with this kind of arrangement. Therefore, this model is not simply about ‘funding' a start-up," Katti said.
He, however, did not rule out raising more money for expanding Demand Farm from traditional venture capitalists (VCs). “That being said, VCs will have a role to play in future...in Demand Farm as we go further in our journey."
Katti is one of a growing tribe of entrepreneurs tapping potential customers for jointly building products and even raising seed money.
Demand Farm, for instance, has scaled up to around 200 users at Mu Sigma responsible for managing dozens of customer accounts. Some customers, who enter early in the game, start feeling left out after the start-up scales up, experts said. “They invest because they feel, ‘They grew on my back, so how do I retain some engagement even after scale up?'," said Ravi Gururaj, chairman of the Nasscom Product Council.
Rajaram and several other angel investors have now invested around $1 million in Katti's firm and hold 40% of the equity.
More than money, enterprise customers are able to help start-ups build products that address real problems. “It is an age-old tradition. Start-ups need to lean on customers for requirements, investment, credibility and reference accounts, while customers like to know that they can have a solution to a pain, they sense value," said Gururaj.
In a similar example, former Infosys Ltd executives Arun Ramu and Rajinder Gandotra were mentored by former chief technology officer of ICICI Bank LtdPravir Vohra. Ramu and Gandotra founded Avekshaa Technologies Pvt. Ltd two years ago, offering ways to make different enterprise solutions work together.
Vohra helped them understand potential problems that their product could address by becoming Avekshaa's first customer. With revenue of ₹ 4 crore in the year ended March, Avekshaa aims to become a $100 million firm in five years.
“An anchor client is always important in the journey of a company. Initial endorsement from a customer like Pravir was extremely important as it was reaffirmation of our business idea. This also helped in gaining further business as we had a reference project we could talk about with our client," Gandotra added.
To be sure, entrepreneurs need to be cautious in enlisting potential customers as investors, some companies tend to give away too much exclusivity in a hurry, which shackles future growth.
“The biggest challenge is keeping the product relevant for a larger customer base and not just one customer," said Katti, who moved with his four-member team to Bangalore from Pune last month.
Online retailer Zappos.com is asking its 24 million customers to reset their passwords after a cyberattack, according to a posting on the company's website.
"We were recently the victim of a cyberattack by a criminal who gained access to parts of our internal network and systems through one of our servers in Kentucky," says the posting, which was sent out as an e-mail from company CEO Tony Hsieh to Zappos employees on Sunday.
The company said it had expired and reset customers' passwords and would be sending an e-mail with further instructions to all its customers. It also posted password reset instructions on its website.
Zappos said that hackers gained access to customers' names, e-mail addresses, billing and shipping addresses, phone numbers, and the last four digits of credit card numbers and encrypted passwords.
Full credit card numbers and other payment info were stored on a separate server which was not hacked, the company said.
Because it expects a deluge of phone calls related to the hacking, Zappos said it was temporarily turning off its phones and would answer all inquiries by e-mail.
"If 5% of our customers call, that would be over 1 million phone calls, most of which would not even make it into our phone system in the first place," the company's e-mail to employees said.
"We've spent over 12 years building our reputation, brand, and trust with our customers. It's painful to see us take so many steps back due to a single incident," Hsieh's e-mail said..
The e-mail also went out to customers of Zappos discount website, 6pm. com.
While large, the hacking attack was not the largest of the past year. In April, Sony's PlayStation Network, with 70 million customers, was hacked, with an "unauthorized person" obtaining users' names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, birth dates and passwords, according to Sony.
It's another busy day for students in Nikki Dates' fifth grade class at Jefferson Elementary School in Gary, Indiana.
Date has a lot to cover -- she teaches every subject from this one classroom: “One class. One person. All day,” she said.
Dates is a product of Gary's school system and came back to Gary after college to begin her teaching career. She's been at it for 16 years, with the last nine at Jefferson.
“These are my people,” said Dates, who appreciates the “sense of being able to give back to my community.”
But Dates is finding it increasingly difficult to do that as Gary schools struggle to stay afloat financially. The school where she taught before Jefferson was shuttered. Now, Jefferson is facing the same fate.
In December, the school board voted to close Jefferson and two other school district facilities at the end of the academic year to save money.

It's just the latest cost-cutting effort for a district drowning in red ink. By June, Gary's accumulated debt is expected to reach $101 million.
In the last two years, Gary has had to close six buildings amid declining enrollment, dwindling tax revenue and competition from public charter schools.
The school system is struggling make payroll each month. It delayed checks to 700 employees, mostly teachers, in November. March is also likely to be a problem, school district staff said last week at a Gary School Board meeting.
It wasn't always this way
Gary's public school system was once one of the largest in Indiana and a model nationwide.
It educated a Nobel prize winning economist, an Oscar-winning actor, successful business leaders, entertainers and athletes.
“The Gary Community School Corporation is experiencing an unprecedented financial crisis unlike any school corporation has experienced in the state of Indiana,” Indiana State Sen. Eddie Melton told an education committee at the Indiana Statehouse this month. His district includes Gary.
“The district is struggling on a day-to-day basis to ensure payroll is met and that critical vendors, such as health insurance and bus services, are paid,” the Democrat said.
He and other Hoosier lawmakers are searching for solutions for Gary, including greater funding, forgiving outstanding state loans or appointing a fiscal monitor.
But none will fix two of Steel City's greatest problems: industry decline and population loss.
Since 1970, some 100,000 residents -- almost half the city's population -- have left Gary. Only about 77,000 remain, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Gary has been bleeding jobs, especially at the steel mills, for decades.
Big employers like U.S. Steel are still around, but its workforce has shrunk over the years. And, the huge steel facility can't produce fat property tax checks for the school system because a decade-old state property tax cap limits how much the Gary schools can collect.
Declining funding
The cap has caused tax revenues to plummet all over the state, but no community was hit harder than Gary because of its reliance on the steel industry. Then, a recent effort to raise property taxes by $8 million a year was narrowly rejected by Gary voters in November.
Those problems have drained Gary of students and the needed tax dollars to run a healthy school system.
“When I first came to Gary in 1964, there were over 40 schools in the city,” longtime Gary school board member Nellie Moore explained. “We had about 40,000 children.”
Today, there are fewer than two dozen schools and school-related buildings the district maintains but less dollars to do so. On Feb. 14, the school board voted to lay off 11 custodians.
Gary's schools have suffered while enrollment at Gary's public charter schools has soared.
“There is a connection between the proliferation of charter schools and the need to stabilize the Gary Community Schools Corporation,” said Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson.
Every child who leaves Gary's public schools for a charter takes with them tax dollars that the city could spend on its schools.
In 2006, Gary schools had about 12,000 students. Today, the traditional public schools serve less than 6,000. Another 5,500 are enrolled in charter schools in Gary.
“I believe in school choice,” Freeman-Wilson told the senate committee on Feb. 2. “I think our job right now is to make sure that every choice that a parent has is a viable and a quality choice. And right now that means working to shore up the traditional public school corporation in the city of Gary.”
Back at Jefferson Elementary, principal Michael Buckner walks the halls trying to keep spirits high.
“The morale is low right now,” Buckner said. “And we're doing everything we can to conduct business as usual.”
Jefferson is more than just a school in this struggling community. Besides providing breakfast and lunch for students, the building acts as a sort of community center, even providing services to parents, like computer training and job search assistance.
Though the decision to close Jefferson has been made, Buckner is still hoping his school could be saved.
“I truly believe if we can really make a turn around and show higher test scores and better behavior from the kids, they might have to reconsider closing Jefferson,” Buckner said. “I'm hoping and praying for that to happen.”

Siri, meet Donna.
Donna is the name of a new iOS(s AAPL) app that blends location services, calendaring, reminders and push notifications to embody an actual personal assistant that keeps your schedule for you. It was created by the four founders at San Francisco's Incredible Labs: former Twitter product lead Kevin Cheng, along with Scott San Filippo, Arshad Tayyeb and Spence Murray, who arrived from Gracenote, DoubleTwist and Netscape, respectively.

Siri is a voice-powered assistant — you ask Siri questions about anything, from directions to making reservations for dinner. Donna's creators are less focused on search; this app asks the questions and triest to anticipate what you need before you even have to ask what's next on your personal schedule.
In developing the app, they talked to personal assistants, executive assistants, and people who employ them to understand the attributes that make for a good assistant. They didn't just pick a random woman's name — the app is named after an iconic television assistant: Donna Moss, the assistant to the Deputy White House Chief of Staff Josh Lyman on The West Wing — and someone they think reflects the best qualities of a person in that position: proactive, strong, intelligent, Cheng said.
“Good assistants seem to be people who, you ask them something, and they give the information back to you,” Cheng told me in a call earlier this week. “But really great assistants are the ones that are a step ahead of you and gave you the information before you realized you even needed it.”
In that way Donna shares similarities with Google Now(s GOOG) — which is Android-only at the moment. That's a search product, but it also uses location and user habits to anticipate what you want. But it doesn't quite mimic the schedule-keeping of an assistant.
Putting an app to work for you
Based on all the stuff she does, it's clear Donna is intended for really busy people — people who use an app like AnyDO or Wunderlist may see similarities, but with an added proactive element. It takes your appointment details from your phone's calendar, uses your contacts, your location and the location of where you need to be next to tell you where and when you need to leave to make your next appointment on time. It cuts out fiddling with your phone to figure out directions, the weather or what's coming next on your calendar.
It does other things to mimic a real human assistant too: you get a push notification when it's time to leave for your next meeting; you get an update at the end of the day about what's on the schedule for tomorrow; and if it's raining at the location you're heading too it'll let you know to bring an umbrella.
But the app is designed so that you actually don't spend that much time in it: you simply get a notification for what's next (or a call, which is in the works). And in order to not be annoying it only notifies you with something that immediately needs your attention — time to leave, time to get on a Skype call or Webex discussion, time to wake up, etc.
From there it does a lot of work for you: swipe the notification for a conference call and it will not only automatically dial you in, it will put in the conference code and mute you as well — to mimic a personal assistant dialing you in.
The app is free and the company won't have any ads in Donna — the info you share with your personal assistant should stay personal, Cheng said — but they do have a business plan in mind: subscription access. But that's only if they can make themselves “valuable” enough someday to charge, he said.
Donna is launching in private beta starting Thursday, so you'll have to sign up for an invitation. Cheng says he hopes to open the app to the public soon after.
Incredible Labs has raised $2.5 million in seed funding so far from Khosla Ventures, Betaworks, Maynard Webb, Crunchfund, Ashton Kutcher and others.
It's been more than a year since the Hawaii Department of Health urged developer Forest City Residential Management to test the soil near homes on Marine Corps Base Hawaii on windward Oahu for possible pesticide contamination.
The soil sampling still hasn't happened.
But 44 military families have filed five separate lawsuits against Forest City and its former subsidiary Ohana Military Communities, now owned by developer Hunt Companies, contending that the firms failed to disclose pesticide contamination near their homes.
Residents have raised concerns about health problems that they fear are linked to possible pesticide contamination of the surface soil surrounding their homes.
Forest City and Hunt Companies are pursuing their own case against Cara Barber, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran who lived on the Kaneohe base for several years and was the lead plaintiff in the initial lawsuit against Forest City in 2014.

After a magistrate judge recommended against certifying her case as a class action, Barber settled the case in February for undisclosed terms. In May, Forest City and Hunt filed a motion for preliminary injunction against her for allegedly violating the confidentiality provision of her settlement agreement and defaming the companies on Facebook and her blog.
The settlement is sealed and relevant sections of related court documents have been redacted. But the developers provided thousands of pages of exhibits, including emails and social media posts, to back up their argument.
“While Mrs. Barber has long made a practice of posting exaggerated and disingenuous statements to social media, her new campaign is dangerously untrue and misleading,” the developers said.
They contended that Barber coordinated a “smear campaign” with her former attorneys to “intentionally spread false information and fear related to MCBH housing in an attempt to drive new clients to Ms. Barber's former attorneys.”
Judge Helen Gillmor ruled partially in the companies' favor Aug. 26. Her order is sealed, but is summarized in a publicly available mediation questionnaire, and in Barber's appeal filed with the Ninth Circuit Court.
Forest City OMC Exhibit
Forest City and Hunt Companies have also sought to prevent Barber's attorneys from Smith Law and Revere & Associates from representing Barber “and all other current and former residents of military housing who have submitted mediation demands against Defendants since May 1, 2016.”
The companies said more than 100 families contacted them seeking mediation after May 1.
So far, 44 families have filed lawsuits, and attorney Kyle Smith said there are more to come.
But he may not get to represent them. Forest City and Hunt, represented by attorneys from Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel and Cox Fricke filed a motion on Oct. 28 to disqualify Barber's attorneys, contending that they have conflicts of interest and violated professional rules of conduct by allegedly soliciting clients.
As evidence, the companies point to a letter from Smith and attorney Terry Revere to many MCBH residents explaining the Barber case had settled and stating, “We are writing to inform you that you should contact an attorney if you wish to pursue your potential legal claims against Forest City.”
The letter also says that families who lived in Marine Corps Base Hawaii from 2006 to 2014 may have valid legal claims for the return of their Basic Housing Allowance, a subsidy provided by the Department of Defense.
In a court filing, Smith and Revere called the companies' efforts “onerous blackmail tactics,” noting that the companies offered to drop their case against Barber if her attorneys agreed not to represent any additional families who have raised concerns since May 1.
“(Ohana Military Communities') motion not only seeks to stifle speech by Mrs. Barber related to MCBH regardless of content, but OMC intentionally wields its motion as a sword to prevent new claims by other MCBH families,” they wrote.
There hasn't yet been a ruling on the motion to disqualify Smith and Revere, according to federal court records available online.
Health Concerns
The concerns about potential pesticide contamination at Marine Corps Base Hawaii date back to 2006.
That's when Ohana Military Communities, at the time a subsidiary of Forest City, took over housing on the base. In the process of the demolishing some homes and building others, the developer discovered the soil contained high levels of organochlorine pesticides left over from termite treatments.
Forest City completed a state-approved pesticide management plan, which permitted higher levels of carcinogenic pesticides than the Environmental Protection Agency generally recommends remaining in the surface soil because it was assumed military families would not live on the base longer than six years.
In the meantime, residents were reporting problems with asthma, cancer and birth defects. Dr. Walter Chun, an environmental hazard consultant who worked for the developer that built the original homes on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, created a map of the illnesses and urged the state repeatedly to take action on the pesticide concerns.

Hawaii Department of Health remedial project manager Eric Sadoyama requested soil sampling from Forest City in September 2015 after reviewing Chun's anecdotal data of health concerns.
He didn't hear back until May 2016. Since then, he's been working with Ohana Military Communities to develop a soil sampling plan and hopes to receive one by the end of the month.
Representatives of Forest City and Hunt Companies declined to comment for this report, citing the pending litigation.
Barber similarly declined to comment on the lawsuit against her, but said she's still very concerned about the lack of soil sampling.
“I'm hoping and praying that the Department of Health will be able to get testing done,” Barber said.
Soil Sampling
Sadoyama said even if the soil sampling plan is received and approved this month, it could still take several months for the testing to be conducted and analyzed and for a report to be written.
That means it might be well into 2017 before families like Barber's get answers to the long-held concerns.
According to Sadoyama, the Department of Health believes it has the jurisdiction to require Ohana Military Communities to conduct soil sampling.
But he said the Department of Defense and Forest City have previously disputed that jurisdiction, and the agency hasn't fought the issue, choosing instead to “strongly recommend” that the developer conduct testing and wait for voluntarily compliance.
Sadoyama said the agency's reluctance to set a timeline for the developer to comply is due to the lack of evidence that there is pesticide contamination.
“If we did have clear evidence that something is actually wrong, we would move on it,” he said. Still, he said the agency has continued to urge the developer to conduct soil sampling because so many residents have reported health concerns.
“We want to resolve this issue because we don't want to have this lingering question out there,” Sadoyama said. “As far as we can tell, we don't have any evidence that suggests that something was done wrong. We just don't have enough evidence to know for sure it was done right.”
Below are the four lawsuits recently filed against Forest City and Ohana Military Communities:
ISLAMABAD: Facing the charge of receiving funds from unauthorised means, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has now called for scrutiny of the accounts and funds of all political parties, specifically the religious parties.
Claiming that the PTI has submitted complete record of the party funds and accounts as well as a list of all donors to the Supreme Court, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhry said that now it was the turn of other political parties, including the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) and religious parties, to disclose their sources of funds.
Speaking at a news conference along with the party's former information secretary Naeemul Haq here on Monday, the PTI spokesman asked the country's intelligence agencies to find out the sources of funds of the religious parties.
“We have presented our record. We hope that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other institutions will now ask (about the source of funding) from other parties,” he said, adding that instead of treating overseas Pakistanis with suspicion, secret agencies and other institutions should probe “funding of the PML-N and religious parties with keen eye”.
PPP rejects allegation of receiving funds from abroad
Fawad Chaudhry, who is one of the legal advisers of PTI chief Imran Khan, alleged that Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) had been receiving funds from Libya whereas there were parties which received funds from Saudi Arabia and Iran.
The PTI leader said his party had been asked to provide details of its accounts and funds only for the period between 2010 and 2013, but they had submitted the seven-year record till March 2017.
Showing the bulk of documents, he claimed that the party had submitted the list of more than 30,000 Pakistanis living in the US who had contributed to the party funds. Over the past seven years, he said, the party had received more than $3 million and all transactions had been made through “official banking channel”. He said that under the US laws, individuals could not donate funds directly to parties, so the PTI had to hire services of “agent companies” for the purpose.
Fawad Chaudhry claimed that all members of the board of governors of these companies were overseas Pakistanis and their details had also been provided to the Supreme Court, adding that that 99 per cent of the donors had donated the amount between $10 and $15. He said the PTI did not have big donors like Osama bin Laden who, he alleged, had provided billions of rupees to the PML-N.
On the other hand, he said, the Joint Investigation Team, which probed the money laundering allegations against the Sharif family, had revealed that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had donated Rs145m to the PML-N. But, he claimed, there was no mention of this amount in the accounts details of the PML-N.
“Where has this money gone? This shows that Nawaz Sharif has used the PML-N for money laundering,” he said, criticising the ECP and other financial institutions for not taking action against the ruling party.
He criticised Defence Minister Khawaja Asif for accusing Imran Khan of misusing the charity money and said the minister had not been able to even establish a dispensary in his hometown Sialkot, but always remained active in criticising the projects like Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital.
Naeemul Haq claimed that the PTI had not violated any law of the country while receiving funds from abroad. He said the PTI had also submitted to the court details of the accounts of other political parties so that it could make a comparison.
Money trail documents
PTI secretary general Jahangir Tareen posted on his official Twitter account images of the documents which Imran Khan had submitted to the Supreme Court to prove the money trail for the purchase of his flat in London.
Mr Khan, while speaking at a news conference on Sunday, had shown some of the documents to journalists and said he had provided complete details of his banking transactions to the court and money trail for not only his London flat, but also Banigala property.
PPP rebuttal
Spokesman for the Pakistan People's Party Senator Farhatullah Babar on Monday rejected the PTI's allegation that the party had received funds from abroad.
“Neither the party has received funds from abroad nor it has held fund-raising events in any foreign country at any time,” Mr Babar said while commenting on reports that the PTI had submitted some documents before the ECP claiming that the PPP had also received foreign funding.
Mr Babar said the PPP was funded entirely by the money raised in Pakistan while the overseas units of the party financed themselves locally there in accordance with the laws of the country.

China has protested to the United States after Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington hoisted a Taiwanese flag on New Year's Day, calling on the United States to respect the “One China” policy, the foreign ministry said on Monday.
Taiwan's China Post newspaper reported on Saturday that it was the first time the Taiwanese flag was raised in the United States in 36 years since the United States switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1979.
More than 100 people attended the ceremony at the Twin Oaks Estate in Washington last Thursday, including Taiwan's top envoy to the U.S. Shen Lyushun, the China Post said, citing the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Washington.
“We resolutely oppose the so-called flag-raising ceremony by Taiwan's agency in the United States and have lodged solemn representations with the United States,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing.
Mainland China deems Taiwan a renegade province and has never ruled out the use of force to take it back, particularly if the island makes a move toward independence. China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since defeated Nationalist forces fled to the island at the end of a civil war with the Communists in 1949.
Hua called on the United States to abide by the ‘One China' policy and “prudently and properly handle” any issues related to Taiwan so as to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
The flag-raising ceremony is the latest incident involving Taiwan to roil relations between the United States and China. Beijing said in December that it had lodged a protest with the United States after President Barack Obama signed into law legislation authorizing the sale of up to four Perry-class guided missile frigates to Taiwan.
While Taiwan and China have signed a series of landmark trade and economic agreements since 2008, political and military suspicions still run deep, especially in democratic Taiwan where many fear China's true intentions.

A Website in a Minute Using Dancer, the Effortless Web Framework
While Perl has a few heavy hitters in the web framework world (Catalyst, Jifty, CGI::App), sometimes they can seem like overkill. When writing a light web service or a high-end but not-as-complex website, you might want something smaller and simpler. This is where Dancer comes in.
Dancer is a web framework whose purpose is to let you get a website up and running within a minute, if not sooner. It started as a port of Ruby's Sinatra but has since took its own path.
Dancer supports Plack/PSGI from an early version and has a built-in scaffolding script to help you get up and running within seconds. It creates deployment scripts for you, includes a guide for deployment situations to help you configure your webserver (whether Perlbal, Apache, Lighttpd or anything else you might care to use) and has a default clean design to help you prototype your website faster.
Dancing
The best way to learn, understand, and fall in love with Dancer is to get on the dance floor:
$ cpan Dancer # or cpanp, or cpanm $ dancer -a MyApp + ./MyApp + MyApp/views + MyApp/views/index.tt + MyApp/views/layouts + MyApp/views/layouts/main.tt + MyApp/environments + MyApp/environments/development.yml + MyApp/environments/production.yml + MyApp/config.yml + MyApp/app.psgi + MyApp/MyApp.pm + MyApp/MyApp.pl + MyApp/public + MyApp/public/css + MyApp/public/css/style.css + MyApp/public/css/error.css + MyApp/public/images + MyApp/public/404.html + MyApp/public/dispatch.fcgi + MyApp/public/dispatch.cgi + MyApp/public/500.html
The dancer application creates a views folder, which contains layout and templates. It contains sane defaults you can use to start. It also creates a config.yaml file and an environments folder for environment-specific configurations. MyApp.pm and MyApp.pl are the main application files. MyApp.pl includes a built-in webserver for the development (or even deployment!) of your application. The public folder contains default CSS and images.
This directory tree includes a few other interesting files; these are dispatchers for various backends. The PSGI dispatcher is app.psgi. The CGI and FCGI dispatchers are public/dispatch.cgi and public/dispatch.fcgi, respectively.
Look in MyApp/MyApp.pm. Dancing really is this simple!
package MyApp; use Dancer; get '/' => sub { template 'index'; }; true;
What does this all mean?
Routes
Dancer uses the notion of routes to specify the paths your users might take in your website. All you need in order to write a Dancer application is to define routes. Routes are not only simple, but concise and versatile. They support variables (named matching, wildcard matching), regular expressions and even conditional matching.
Here are a few examples:
get '/' => sub { return 'hello world!'; };
This route defines the root path of the application. If someone reaches http://example.com/, it will match this route.
The word get signifies the HTTP method (GET) for which the path exists. If you use a web form, you need a route for a POST method:
post '/user/add/' => sub { # create a user using the data from the form };
There are a few more methods (del for DELETE, put for PUT). You can also use any to provide a single route for all HTTP methods or for several specific methods:
any ['get', 'post'] => sub { # both post and get will reach here! };
Variables are clean and simple:
get '/user/view/:username/' => sub { my $username = params->{username}; template 'users' => { username => $username }; };
This route matches http://example.com/user/view/variable/, while variable can be of any type.
Of course, you can write a more complex wildcard matching:
get '/download/*.*' => sub { # we extract the wild card matching using splat my ( $file, $ext ) = splat; };
If you feel rambunctious, you can define a regular expression:
get r( '/hello/([\w]+)' ) => sub { my ($name) = splat; };
Note that in these examples, the splat keyword returns the values that the wildcards (the * used in routes) or regular expressions (declared with r() ) match. As a convenience, note also that you do not have to escape the forward slash regex delimiters used in r() ; Dancer escapes them for you.
Multiple Routes
When writing many routes, you might find it easier to separate them to different files according to their prefixes. Dancer provides prefix and load to help you with that.
# in main Dancer application: load 'UserRoutes.pm'; # in UserRoutes.pm: use Dancer ':syntax'; # importing just the syntax to create routes prefix '/user'; get '/view/' => sub { ... }; get '/edit/' => sub { ... }; get '/delete/' => sub { ... };
These will match http://example.com/user/view/, http://example.com/user/edit/ and http://example.com/user/delete/, respectively.
Built for scalability
Dancer has a built-in route caching mechanism, making sure that even when you have a lot of routes, it will be able to serve them at almost the same speed as though you had only a few routes. This means that even if you have 600 routes, you do not have to worry about your application being slow!
Variables
Dancer supports internal variables. Declare them with var , and you can later fetch them inside your routes:
var waiter => 'sawyer'; get '/welcome/' => sub { my $name = vars->{waiter}; return "Hi, I'm $name and I'll be your waiter this evening."; };
Filters
Sometimes you want to be able to specify code to run before any route. KiokuDB, for example, requires you to make a scope whenever you want to work with the database. This is easy to automate with the before filter:
before sub { var scope => $dir->new_scope; };
Another common technique is to verify a session:
before sub { if ( !session('user') && request->path_info !~ m{^/login} ) { # Pass the original path requested along to the handler: var requested_path => request->path_info; request->path_info('/login'); } };
Templates
Dancer will return to the user agent whatever you return from a route, just like PSGI does. “Hello, world!” in Dancer is:
get '/' => sub { 'Hello, world!' };
Plain text isn't always what you want, so Dancer has powerful support for templates. There are various template engines available (Template::Toolkit, Template::Tiny, Tenjin, Text::Haml, and Mason, to name a few). Dancer also provides a default simple template engine called Dancer::Template::Simple. This gives you a simple self-contained template engine at no additional cost!
The template keyword allows you to specify which template to process and which variables to pass to the template:
get '/user/view/:name' => sub { my $name = params->{name}; # Dancer adds .tt automatically, but this is configurable template 'show_user' => { name => $name, user => get_user($name), }; };
Dancer automatically supplies you an encompassing layout for your templates, much like Template's WRAPPER option. This built-in template means you can use the layout with other template engines, such as Template::Tiny.
Dancer accomplishes this by rendering two templates: the one you provided and a (configurable) layout template. The layout template gets the output of rendering your template as a content variable, then embeds that content in the general page layout.
The default templates that come with Dancer demonstrate this point very well. Here's main.tt, the default layout:
<html><head><!-- some default css --></head> <body> <% content %> </body> </html>
Serializers make RESTing easier
Serializers are a new feature in Dancer (available since version 1.170). They allow automatic serialization for your output in various forms (Data::Dumper, YAML, or JSON) to shorten the amount of code you have to write in your application.
When programming a RESTful service, the JSON serializer cuts down much of your code by automatically serializing your output. This makes your server-side AJAX code much more efficient and less boilerplate code for you to write.
File uploads are fun
File uploads exist since version 1.170. Within a route, write:
# several files my @files = request->upload(); # single file my $file = request->upload(); # then you can do several things with that file $file->copy_to('/my/upload/folder'); my $fh = $file->file_handle; my $content = $file->content; my $filename = $file->filename;
Easy configuration
You can configure everything (logging, session handling, template layout, file locations) in Dancer using the main configuration file (appdir/config.yml). There are configuration files for your specific environment (production and development) and you can provide environment-specific configurations in the corresponding file (appdir/environments/development.yml, for example).
Summary
While Dancer is still evolving, it is already a production-ready simple-yet-powerful web framework lets you get from zero to web in record time. Put on your dancing shoes, define your steps, and bust a move!
Dancer is available on the CPAN (Dancer), and Dancer development takes place on Github.

Changing mindsets begins with you! The only mind you can be sure of changing is your own, and the only way that you can demonstrate this mindset change is through your behaviors. If you aspire for your organization to be faster, more innovative, less afraid of failure, it has to begin by you being faster, more involved in innovation and being willing to be the failure role-model. If you doesn't try it, why should anyone else who works for you?
We live in the midst of a landscape-changing revolution, driven by unprecedented access to information, the globalization of ideas and accelerating convergence of sensors and knowledge. Business models are unrecognizable; customer engagement is completely different than it used to be; revenue is collected in patterns that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago, including “free”; our new talent has different aspirations; and we all work in a fundamentally different way than we did in the past. Powerful digital engines are everywhere, capable of the continuous production of new knowledge to feed new ideas. But, where are you? Are you still an analog leader in a digital world?
The key aspect of digital mindsets are:
Speed in everything – quick bursts of experimentation and feedback seeking; prototyping and then rapid scaling up. About 100,000 customers had registered on Flipkart to buy the 20,000 Mi 3 smartphones. They were sold out in 5 seconds. Analog mindsets cannot comprehend this kind of speed, much less respond in kind. Think continuous processes, e.g., customer surveys are ongoing and the response to feedback is instantaneous. Every employee is in both sales and customer service! Multiple sources of data. Data gathering is also continuous. Big Data backed by Analytics drives choices.
We believe that leadership and innovation starts with personal action. Want to be innovative? Act innovatively! The metaphor that we think fits best with this is that the “spirit of our times” has moved from analog to digital, and that leaders now need to act digitally rather than analog. That means doing things in a way that the digital economy would suggest, rather than the way we've always done it [analog]. Below are some of the attributes of analog and digital leadership that we see – in an exploratory, prototyping sense.
What you'll notice is that some aspects of digital leadership have been around for a long time….. not surprising! However, it's the coherence of the leadership approach – practicing all of these things routinely, rather than one of these things occasionally, that makes the difference between an analog and a digital leader. If leadership style matters, and we think it certainly does, than a coherent style will always be better than an incoherent one, especially if you want to establish a shared style among your team, or your colleagues, or your organization.
Be digital!
When Jyllene Edwards Wilson had a problem — a cold, an ache or odd pains — she called her ob/gyn of 20 years. When he changed offices, she followed him. When she and her husband's hopes of conceiving a child ended in an ectopic pregnancy, the doctor held her hand and cried with them both.
Nikita Levy, she said, was like family.
So when police discovered in February 2013 that Levy, the Johns Hopkins gynecologist Wilson thought of as “gentle and caring,” had been secretly taking thousands of sexually explicit videos and photos of his patients with a tiny camera hidden in pens or key fobs, Wilson at first didn't believe it.
Now, she is too ashamed to face the host of friends and family she enthusiastically referred to Levy. And she has yet to see a doctor again or step foot in the East Baltimore clinic where Levy practiced.
“I trusted this man with my innermost parts and my innermost secrets,” she said. “Now, I'm not trusting anyone. Not at all.”
Wilson is one of about 8,500 women who are part of a class-action lawsuit against Johns Hopkins Hospital alleging a grotesque violation of their trust and their privacy. On Monday, Hopkins agreed to pay $190 million to settle their claims.
In court papers filed last week, the women also allege that Levy performed unnecessary and excessive pelvic examinations, touched them in inappropriate ways and sometimes saw them alone, failing to follow the routine practice of having another medical staffer in the room.
Wilson said she is not the only one who hasn't been to the doctor since the investigation was made public in February 2013. Levy took his life shortly thereafter.
“These women are distraught. They're in fear. Angry. Anxious. They feel betrayed,” said the women's attorney, Jonathan Schochor. “Many of them have just dropped out of the medical system. They're not going to physicians. They're not getting tests done. And many are not taking their children, either.”
Levy, who was 54 when he died, was a graduate of Cornell University Medical College and had worked at Johns Hopkins's East Baltimore Medical Center since 1988. It is a community clinic that serves the largely low-income and African American surrounding neighborhood.
Although 12,500 women signed onto the class action, Schochor said that some names may be duplicates. He estimates that 8,500 women will ultimately be compensated. The women will be assessed by a forensic psychiatrist, he said, divided into four classes, from mild to severe experiences, perceptions and symptoms, and an allocation team will recommend amounts for each plaintiff.
Schochor said the settlement, which received preliminary approval from the Baltimore City Circuit Court, will now proceed to a fairness hearing, set for Sept. 19. And, if there are no appeals, it could be finalized in mid-October.
Schochor, who said he has been filing medical malpractice claims against Hopkins since 1974, said he and the other plaintiff attorneys have been in “brutal negotiations” with Johns Hopkins for 18 months. He commended the hospital for signing off on the settlement agreement.
“This is a significant step forward,” Schochor said. “Everyone is very hopeful that the final fairness hearing will end in fair compensation for Dr. Levy's patients, so everyone can put this catastrophic event behind them.”
Johns Hopkins Hospital spokeswoman Kim Hoppe said that funds for the settlement will be paid through insurance and would not affect patient services.
“It is our hope that this settlement — and findings by law enforcement that images were not shared — helps those affected achieve a measure of closure,” she said in a statement. “We assure you that one individual does not define Johns Hopkins.”
But Wilson, Levy's longtime patient, said she is far from closure, much less understanding.
“I wish I could have some closure. This was a person I knew and grew to love. He was the only doctor I ever gave Christmas presents to,” she said. “But then he killed himself, and left us all wondering, why did he do this? I feel like such a fool.”
A co-worker contacted Johns Hopkins Hospital's security department Feb. 4, 2013, about Levy, and within a day, according to hospital officials, they determined the gynecologist had been taking photos and videos of his patients without their knowledge or consent. He was fired Feb. 8 as Baltimore police began to investigate.
Police seized six cameras concealed in pens, two cameras hidden in key fobs, four computers and external hard drives from Levy's Towson, Md.-area home. He was found dead Feb. 18, a helium-filled plastic bag over his head. He had left a note of apology to his wife. Police concluded their investigation in March 2014.

The pong from handling iron or copper comes from your own skin.
The pong from handling iron or copper comes from your own skin.
Why does metal smell? Chemists have found a surprising answer: it doesn't.
After you've grasped an iron railing, a door handle or a piece of steel cutlery, your hand often gives off what seems to be a metallic odour. But Dietmar Glindemann of the University of Leipzig, Germany, and his co-workers say that you're not smelling the metal at all.
They have found that the musty odour comes from chemical compounds in your skin, which are transformed in an instant by the touch of iron. They report the results in the international edition of Angewandte Chemie1.
Copper has a similar effect, accounting for the metallic smell created by handling coins made of copper alloys. "When a shopkeeper hands you a coin," says Glindemann, "you're smelling his body odour."
The smelly reactions induced by these metals create "the sensory illusion that it is the 'metal in itself' that we smell right after touching it", the researchers say. In other words, a 'metallic' smell is only deemed to be so by association.
Sweaty palms
“ When a shopkeeper hands you a coin, you're smelling his body odour. ” Dietmar Glindemann,
University of Leipzig When a shopkeeper hands you a coin, you're smelling his body odour.
Glindemann began studying this question years ago when he became curious about the garlic-tinged metallic aroma of iron after it has been touched by a sweaty palm. He found that acids naturally present in sweat induce reactions between carbon and phosphorus impurities typically present in iron, generating smelly, volatile molecules called organophosphines.
But the 'metallic' smell left on your hands after you handle iron or copper was different from the scent of metals touched by acid in the lab. "This problem tortured me for five or six years," Glindemann says.
The breakthrough came when he teamed up with environmental chemist Andrea Dietrich at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg. She was trying to understand why people often complain of a metallic taste in drinking water.
Exploring the issue of metallic taste led her to think about metallic smell. That took her to Glindemann, and they cracked the problem together.
The researchers captured the vapours emitted from the skin of people who had handled iron objects, and studied their chemical composition. The gases contained several compounds called aldehydes and ketones, which often have strong and distinctive smells. The odour of preserving fluid, or formaldehyde, makes for the characteristic reek of old anatomy labs, for example, while the ketone acetone makes the distinctive solvent whiff of nail-varnish remover.
These compounds are produced by rapid reactions between iron or copper and oils on our skin.
Is that mushrooms?
One such compound in particular, called 1-octen-3-one, which is found in the vapours above skin touched by iron, is particularly smelly. Humans can detect it at very low concentrations, and experience it as a mushroom-like, metallic odour.
The researchers think that every person generates a subtly different blend of odorant molecules when they touch metal, and that this blend may change if the individual has a disease such as cancer. So analysing the chemicals in 'iron smell', for example, might provide a kind of medical diagnostic tool. "We're now working to see if the smell caused by iron on skin provides a fingerprint of disease," says Glindemann.
The reactions could also explain Dietrich's question of why drinking water sometimes tastes metallic: organic food particles could be reacting with rust in the water to help form the odour compounds.

Oftentimes, these scenarios can get pretty complicated. To put it simply, two teams could possibly secure a trip to the postseason Sunday: Denver and Indianapolis.
The Colts, who face the Browns on Sunday, can clinch the AFC South with a victory over Cleveland and a Texans loss.
How the Broncos can punch their ticket is a bit more confusing.
Denver captures a playoff spot with a victory over the Bills and a Ravens loss, a Steelers loss, a Browns loss, a Chiefs loss and a Texans loss or tie. The Broncos can also ensure a postseason berth with a win over Buffalo, plus losses by Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and San Diego, a loss or tie by Houston, and a tie by Kansas City.
Already eliminated from postseason contention are the New York Giants, Washington Redskins, Oakland Raiders, Jacksonville Jaguars, Tennessee Titans and New York Jets.

We've all been there—we Google a place, write down the things we think are important to remember, pack to the best of our ability, then embark on an adventure. It usually all works out—as long as you're willing to be flexible and take things in stride. While going with the flow can be great, the best way to learn exactly what you should know is from someone who's been there. So, after three months of living in Peru, here are 7 of the most important things I wish I knew before visiting Peru.
1. Everything is pretty inexpensive, especially the food
If you're about to pay U.S. prices for a meal, you have probably fallen into one of the many tourist-trap restaurants. When it comes to shopping for food or going out to eat in Peru, nearly everything is pretty cheap. You might feel odd at first paying $2 USD for a three-course meal or $4 for take-out Chinese food—I know I sure did—but you'll quickly realize that price does not necessarily correlate with deliciousness.
Yes, there are certainly a number of places worth the splurge, like Central—the fourth best restaurant in the world located in the heart of Lima—but some of my favorite meals in Peru were under $5, eating authentic Peruvian cuisine in quaint hole-in-the-wall restaurants.
2. Things may be cheap, but Western goods aren't always available
I'm not sure what it is about peanut butter, but it seems that once you've entered Peru, it is nearly impossible to find quality peanut butter. While everything is relatively inexpensive, especially food, not everything you are used to will be readily available. In Peru, you will be hard-pressed to find Western candies and chips, pre-packaged vegan foods, and, while avoiding gluten was not a problem for me, it was almost impossible to find the American gluten-free brands I had grown to love. Be sure to plan ahead if there is something you absolutely cannot live without. And yes, I have since packed at least three jars of my beloved peanut butter each time I go somewhere new for an extended period of time.
3. Get ready to do a LOT of hiking
This one is especially applicable if you're planning to travel/move to Cusco, Ollantaytambo, Aguas Calientes, or Puno. These places are smack-dab in the middle of the Andes Mountains, so be prepared to do a lot of uphill hiking. I thought I was in good shape until I started hiking in Cusco—boy, was I wrong. Between the incline and altitude, even the most in-shape travelers may want to train a bit beforehand if planning to climb the Rainbow Mountains, Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu, or do general sightseeing in the more mountainous regions of Peru.
4. The mountain views will take your breath away—literally
I will admit that I was warned about this, yet I still made the mistake of thinking that I would be immune to altitude sickness. The altitude in the center of Cusco is over 11,000 feet, with the peaks of the mountains surrounding it getting to the upper 12,000s. While some people are more prone to it than others, you will get altitude sickness if you push yourself too hard. I, unfortunately, learned this the hard way.
Luckily, coca—a mild stimulant that combats thirst, hunger, pain, and fatigue—can help. Coca leaves, coca candy, and coca tea are plentiful, as are cans of oxygen you can rent or buy, both of which will effectively help you combat the effects of the high altitude. Take it easy your first day in Cusco or anywhere with an elevation of over 10,000 ft. Even walking around the hilly city of Cusco can feel difficult while you are adjusting to the altitude.
Trying to climb the tallest, most beautiful mountain your first day may result in an interesting story for years to come, but probably won't make for an enjoyable climb. As a general rule of thumb, allow at least a day before trying to tackle the mountainous ruins in and surrounding Cusco, and at least two days before embarking on the Inca Trail.
BEWARE: alcohol will affect you more quickly at high altitudes!
5. You'll see stray dogs everywhere
The dogs are pretty harmless, but you should expect to see stray dogs in the middle of the road. This definitely induced a bit of culture shock in me, a girl born and raised in suburbia where dogs were rarely seen without leashes or in fenced-in yards. Just keep in mind that if you feed the dogs, you will become their new best friends, for better and for worse. Sometimes you really don't want a stray dog following you to the gym at 5 am, but hey, what are you gonna do?
6. Bus rides can feel like near-death experiences, especially in the Andes
When I was living in Cusco, my friends and I decided it'd be a good idea to get a cheap bus from Cusco to the Amazon Rainforest. What we did not expect was the terrifying experience that came with it. Barreling down the side of a mountain on windy, one-lane roads, passing crosses that marked where people had perished in the past is not my idea of fun. For a few more dollars, buy a plane ticket and save yourself 12-hours of terror.
Side note: the buses up to Machu Picchu can also be scary, but the drivers are very experienced. Try not to look down the side of the cliff and you'll do fine!
7. Be prepared to fall in love with the people and the culture
Peru is amazing! It is the perfect blend of culture and history while still having modern amenities. From Incan history to Amazonian eco-tours, boating in Lake Titicaca to exploring the more modern city of Lima, if you let yourself, you will fall in love with Peru.
In just three months living in Cusco, I met so many wonderful people! I was welcomed into my host mother's family and was able to immerse myself in rich Peruvian culture. Traveling and living in Peru is all what you make of it. If you approach your experience with an open mind and a willingness to genuinely connect with locals over a Pisco Sour or two, you are sure to walk away with a new-found love.

A pair of polls released Tuesday provides further evidence of a scenario I posited would be conceivable back in December of last year, and predicted was possible in May: the Republican Party's hilariously disastrous decision to nominate Donald Trump for president means that Texas is now in play. According to the Washington Post/Survey Monkey poll , he leads Hillary Clinton by a mere two points. The University of Houston, similarly, puts Trump's lead at three.
These are not the first polls to find Trump with a surprisingly narrow lead in Texas, but my impression, from the reactions they've received, is that many people are just now starting to suspend their disbelief. The explanation for that would be, I suppose, that the evidence is aligned with the narrative that has emerged in the past several weeks. In 2012 Mitt Romney carried Texas by a nearly 16-point margin. But then Romney didn't spend the final weeks of the campaign flailing around furiously, as Trump has been doing lately. It's been a tight race in Texas all summer, but now the close margin makes sense to many people.
The narrowing Texas polls made sense to me even before Trump spent a week lashing out at the numerous women who've stepped forward to say that he assaulted them in precisely the way he bragged about doing, back in 2005. In fact, I predicted, in May, that Clinton could be the first Democratic presidential candidate in decades to put Texas in play. I thought that because I subscribe to the old saw: character is fate. Most Texans are decent people. On that basis alone Trump was bound to underperform Romney and the 2008 nominee, John McCain. Plus, as I noted in December, the same factor that made it hard to believe Clinton had a chance in Texas this year explains why she had a chance of doing so if Trump became the nominee: Texas is a red state. The Republican coalition runs the gamut from temperate pragmatists to principled fighters. Trump, by contrast, is gratuitously vitriolic and ideologically inconsistent at best; with him as the nominee, I wrote, many Texas Republicans would have cause to defect or abstain.
I point all of this out because the current Texas polls, and my ability to predict them, put the lie to Trump's assertions that the election is “rigged.” He means that both metaphorically and literally. Over the past week, he's repeatedly asserted that the media is actively colluding with Clinton and the DNC to make him look bad. He's also insisted that voter fraud is endemic and widespread. As I wrote in August 2015, such arguments have ominous implications, in part because they are inevitably nonfalsifiable:
It's no coincidence that [Trump] keeps casting himself as the victim. His supporters have already succumbed to the premise that Trump is a conservative outsider—a noble underdog, determined to fight the establishment and to speak truth to power. Having accepted that premise, they are predisposed to take any criticism or disagreement as further evidence for Trump's claim that he is surrounded by powerful enemies who are determined to thwart him for their own selfish or corrupt or ideological reasons. His ultimate failure will be taken as proof that the game is rigged—against the candidate, but also against people like themselves, his supporters.
That prediction, too, seems to be playing out. The target audience, at least, is receptive to Trump's claims. A poll taken last week found that 41 percent of voters, including 73 percent of Republicans, believe that the election could in fact be stolen from him at the ballot box. The more nebulous argument, about media bias, is even more intractable, as illustrated by this column by Breitbart's Joel Pollak.
So I've been quite gloomy about Trump's assertions and fatalistic about the prospects for debunking them. But it occurs to me that the tight race in Texas is evidence against Trump and his apologists. No one's rigging anything here, in any sense of the word.
Our election laws, and our elections themselves, are largely under Republican control. Further, Republicans have carried all recent statewide elections by whopping margins; Greg Abbott was elected governor, two years ago, by roughly 20 percent. Voter fraud happens occasionally, as I noted in August, but it is vanishingly rare, especially in states like Texas, where Republicans have taken precautions against it. In other words, even if we assume Texas elections are vulnerable to large-scale fraud, it beggars belief to suggest that such shenanigans would be sufficiently common to obliterate the Republican margins we've come to suspect. Nor would impending voter fraud explain why the University of Houston poll, which put Romney's lead at 17 points four years ago, now shows Trump and Clinton in a virtual tie.
Similarly, the fact that I'm in a position to spike the football the way I did above gives the lie to the idea that the media is rigging the election, either by directly colluding with the DNC or, more generally, by having helped prop up Trump thus far. People like Pollak, at Breitbart, can make a plausible argument that the media, writ large, has helped Trump get this far, if only by giving him so much airtime during the Republican primary. But Trump's boosters can't make that argument against me: I spent most of this year's primary trying feverishly to warn Republicans against his nomination.
And in May, when I laid out my reasoning about why Trump's nomination could put Texas in play, no one took it too seriously. Nor did people believe Clinton, later that month, when she mischievously posited that she saw a chance of winning Texas. And her campaign has, thus far, allocated its resources elsewhere; on Monday it announced its first ad buy in Texas—worth, at most, $100,000, as Abby Livingston explains at the Texas Tribune. Texas Democrats have, meanwhile, been characteristically subdued about the opportunity Trump represents. Even now, with the general election about three weeks away, many of them are surprised by the fact that Trump is struggling here, and reluctant to even get their hopes up.
Texas, in other words, is about the last state that anyone would even try to “rig” on Clinton's behalf. Republicans have put plenty of precautions against voter fraud in place; they also swept the 2014 statewide elections by blistering margins, and Democrats effectively ceded the state's electoral votes to them before this year's election even began. And yet the new polls are in line with the prediction I made months ago. The only explanation that makes sense is the one I offered. Trump is struggling in Texas because he's an incredibly weak candidate. And if he loses the election next month, that will be why.
Bea Arthur was ready to walk away from “The Golden Girls” on more than one occasion, according to a new tell-all book about the cult-favorite 1980s sitcom.
Jim Colucci, author of "Golden Girls Forever: An Unauthorized Look Behind The Lanai," says the bawdy star was particularly upset by what the show's writers came to call “Dorothy bashing.”
“Bea was offended,” he tells FOX411.
“When the writers called Rose [Betty White] dumb or Blanche [Rue McClanahan] a slut or Sophia [Estelle Getty] old, it could roll off those women's backs because they were not like their characters.”
“Unfortunately, the things that were said about Dorothy were that she was big and ugly. And that wears on an actress after a while.”
Arthur was one of 250 actors and crew members Colucci interviewed for the retrospective, which hits bookstores today. He describes Arthur as a “quirky and complicated woman” who hated birds and couldn't stand being around people who chewed gum.
“If you were chewing gum on the set, she would try to have you fired.” he says.
“She also never wanted to wear shoes. She had it written into her contract that she was allowed to not wear shoes as long as she agreed not to sue the producers if she hurt herself.”
According to Colucci, Arthur often spoke about returning to the Broadway stage where she won a Tony Award in 1966 for the role of Vera Charles in “Mame.”
“By the start of the 7th season, Bea made it very clear that she was done,” he says. “She thought the quality was starting to slip. She wanted to go out while it was still a good show and she felt she was done with it.”
The 183rd — and final — episode of “The Golden Girls” aired May 9, 1992.
Ironically, NBC was initially opposed to casting the former “Maude” star as substitute school teacher Dorothy Zbornak, who, after her divorce, moves into a Miami home with her mother and two widowed friends.
“They told the producers, ‘We don't like her,” Colucci says.
At the time, millions of Americans were still turned off by her previous TV character, Maude Finley, who opted to have an abortion in 1972 — before the passage of Roe v. Wade.
“NBC was afraid of putting her in this show because they thought she brought some baggage with her,” he explains.
The network briefly courted Elaine Stritch.
“They wanted a bawdy broad and Elain was cut from the same cloth,” Colucci says.
“But they ultimately relented when [writer] Susan Harris said, ‘I wrote this role for Bea and I want Bea.'”
Here are a few more fun tidbits Colucci shared about the show:
1. Producers wanted a different theme song
“They approached the publishing company for Bette Midler's song, ‘Friends,' but it was too expensive. Eventually of the producers remembered Andrew Gold's song, ‘Thank You For Being A Friend.'”
“They licensed it and hired a session singer named Cynthia Fee. Even though the recording session was slated to last for an hour, she did it in one or two takes — maybe 20 or 30 minutes — and planned on never thinking of it again. The irony is that thanks to unions, every time your song gets played, you get paid. So this job she did on a random weekday in 1985 has put her kids through college.”
2. Betty White and Rue McClanahan switched roles at the last minute
“Betty was cast as Blanche because she played Sue Ann Nivens on ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show' so she could play man hungry. Rue was cast as Rose because she had been Vivian on ‘Maude' and Aunt Fran on ‘Mama's Family.'”
“The director of the pilot, Jay Sandrich, had an idea and said to Rue that he wanted to try her to prepare lines for Blanche. Betty wasn't particularly happy with [the switch] at first but she learned to like it.”
3. The whole thing started as a gag
NBC presented a live spoof comedy sketch to press and advertisers in the fall of 1984 featuring Doris Roberts and Selma Diamond. “They did this schtick where they were confused thinking there was a show on NBC called ‘Miami Nice.' ‘Oh, it must be about old people in Miami. That does sound nice.' When people laughed, the president of the network thought, ‘There might be something there.'”
"Golden Girls Forever: An Unauthorized Look Behind The Lanai" is in bookstores now.

It really is one of the most popular questions around the Disney community: Are the Walt Disney World Dining Plans worth it?
Unfortunately, that is a question that only you can answer by sitting down and doing the math for your group. When price increases occur, many folks reconsider the economics of the Disney Dining Plans.
Recently, Disney quietly increased all three Disney Dining Plan prices for the rest of 2013, which means that anyone who books a package from this point on will be paying these increased prices. It also seems that the “seasonal pricing” during peak seasons now no longer applies: prices are the same year-round.
Here is a look at what you can expect when purchasing the Disney Dining Plans as we move forward with the rest of 2013.
Quick-Service Plan
Adult 10+: $39.64
Child 3-9: $15.75
(Increased from $37.58 for Adults and $14.32 for Children)
The Quick Service Dining Plan allows each guest to get 2 Quick Service Meals per day. For Breakfast you'll receive an entrée or combo meal and a non-alcoholic beverage. For Lunch and Dinner you'll receive an entrée or a complete combo meal, dessert, and a non-alcoholic beverage. You'll also get 1 Snack Option per day, and 1 Refillable Mug per person for the length of your stay.
Standard Dining Plan
Adult 10+: $58.68
Child 3-9: $18.88
(Increased from $55.59 for Adults and $17.16 for Children)
The Standard Dining Plan comes with 1 Quick Service Meal per day, which includes an entrée or combo meal, dessert (lunch or dinner only), and a non-alcoholic beverage. You also get 1 Sit Down Meal per day which includes entrée, dessert (lunch and dinner only), and non-alcoholic beverage, or, if eating at a buffet, the full buffet. You'll also receive 1 Snack Option per day and 1 Refillable Mug per person.
Deluxe Dining Plan
Adult 10+: $104.94
Child 3-9: $29.51

For the Deluxe Dining Plan, guests receive 3 Meals, which can be any combination of either Table Service Meals or Quick Service meals. Table Service meals include an appetizer (lunch and dinner only), entree, dessert (lunch and dinner only), and a non-alcoholic beverage. Or, if eating at a buffet, the full buffet. Quick Service Meals include an entrée or combo meal, dessert (lunch and dinner only and a non-alcoholic beverage. Also included in the plan are 2 Snack Credits per day plus one resort refillable mug per person for the length of stay.
The best thing to do when planning your trip, is to figure out which Disney Dining Plan (or if the Disney Dining Plan) is worth it for you, and to do that, make sure to check out this great post from the blog a few months back with the Disney Dining Plan Calculator Spreadsheet. It may very well be able to help you answer the age old question.
Image caption Toni Paussu is one of the True Finns candidates in the capital Helsinki
An anti-immigration party in Finland - the True Finns - has surged in popularity and could produce a surprise in Sunday's general election, opinion polls suggest.
Jan Sundberg, Professor of Political Science at Helsinki University, looks at the True Finns phenomenon and the party's chances of joining the next coalition government.
The True Finns saw political potential among the neglected people in society. Their political message is two-fold: social-democratic welfare combined with nationalism and xenophobia.
They have targeted dissatisfied Finns who have suffered from the previous governments' economic policies.
The last time Finland faced a similar situation was in 1970, when the True Finns' predecessor, the Rural Party, surged from almost nothing to 18 seats in the 200-seat parliament.
Later the Rural Party split, but it made a successful comeback in the 1983 election.
'Embraced to death'
Finnish politics has been stable for years because ruling coalitions have integrated and then diluted the radical parties of left and right.
Image caption Wide choice: Outright victories are very rare in Finnish general elections
That was the fate of the Communists and, later, the Rural Party. Novelist Leif Salmen wrote that the Communists were "embraced to death". The True Finns emerged from the Rural Party in the 1990s when that party failed to keep its election promises.
Finland is officially bilingual, but the True Finns' nationalism has no room for Swedish. It excludes Swedish as something unfamiliar to Finnish culture. Polls suggest that most Finns share that view and want to stop the mandatory teaching of Swedish in Finnish schools.
There is also a widespread view that immigration is damaging Finland and Finnish culture.
Parties tend to follow popular trends among the electorate, even if they have an authoritarian streak. That is a general weakness of democracy.
The right-wing populist Danish People's Party is not a strong actor in Danish politics, but its xenophobia has spread to the major parties.
The Sweden Democrats, on the other hand, are kept isolated by all parties in the Swedish parliament.
In contrast to Sweden, parties in Finland have adopted - to differing degrees - the nationalist stance of the True Finns. That is certainly true of the Christian Democrats and Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi's Centre Party.
Nationalist message
The True Finns' manifesto indicates they have much in common with right-wing populist parties elsewhere in Europe.
They believe that a low birth rate is not solved by immigration, as that results in problems and foreigners do not fit into Finnish culture. Instead, young women should study less and spend more time giving birth to pure Finnish children. That is like a faint echo of Nazi ideology.
If the True Finns do as well as expected the rival parties may opt for the traditional strategy of integration, but this time it is likely to backfire, because the economic climate has changed.
Finland suffered when the Soviet economy collapsed, because the USSR was a major export market for Finnish goods.
But in 1995 Finland joined the EU and Nokia developed into a globally successful mobile phone manufacturer. Finland joined the eurozone wholeheartedly in 2002.
But for many Finns today EU membership is no longer sexy - not when it involves bailing out countries like Greece, the Republic of Ireland and Portugal.
Other companies have caught up with Nokia and even the traditional "green gold" of Finland - timber - has lost its lustre. One paper and pulp mill after another has closed and many workers have been fired.
If the True Finns join the next coalition Finland will turn in some degree towards stronger nationalism and protectionism.
Correction 20 April 2011: This story has been amended to make it clear that it is the mandatory teaching of Swedish in Finnish schools that is in question - not a ban on teaching Swedish.
In a short statement, the established Church said that the scale of the majorities in both the Commons and Lords made clear that it is the will of Parliament that same-sex couples “should” be allowed to marry.
The Bishop of Leicester, who leads the bishops in the House of Lords, said they would now concentrate their efforts on “improving” rather than halting an historic redefinition of marriage.
It represents a dramatic change of tack in the year since the Church insisted that gay marriage posed one of the biggest threats of disestablishment of the Church of England since the reign of Henry VIII .
And it comes despite a warning from the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, that the redefinition of marriage would undermine the “cornerstone” of society.
The climb-down comes as the newest diocesan bishop in the Church of England said that support for gay marriage was “understandable” because of the way gay people had been treated in Britain in the past.
The Rt Rev David Walker, who was named today as the new Bishop of Manchester, insisted that although the Government bill was “flawed” had he been in the House of Lords he would not have voted against it.
Peers voted by 390 to 148 against a motion which would have struck down the Government's same-sex marriage bill on Tuesday.
It will now be scrutinised by peers who are likely to add a series of amendments to add extra protections for teachers or other workers who object on grounds of conscience.
In a statement, Rt Revd Tim Stevens, Convenor of the Lords Spiritual, said bishops would now “join” with politicians to strengthen parts of the bill rather than resisting it.
“Both Houses of Parliament have now expressed a clear view by large majorities on the principle that there should be legislation to enable same-sex marriages to take place in England and Wales,” he said.
“It is now the duty and responsibility of the Bishops who sit in the House of Lords to recognise the implications of this decision and to join with other members in the task of considering how this legislation can be put into better shape.”
And he made clear that the bishops would look not only at strengthening opt-outs for those who oppose a new definition of marriage but at the future practicalities for people in same-sex unions.
He signalled that bishops would seek to introduce a notion of adultery into the bill and extend parental rights for same-sex partners.
Under the current bill people in a same-sex marriage who discover that their spouse is unfaithful to them would not be able to divorce for adultery after Government legal experts failed to agree what constitutes “sex” between gay or lesbian couples.
The bishops are also seeking to change a provision which says that when a lesbian woman in a same-sex marriage has a baby her spouse is not also classed as the baby's parent.
The result is that in some cases children would be classed as having only one parent.
Bishop Stevens said: “The concerns of many in the Church, and in the other denominations and faiths, about the wisdom of such a move have been expressed clearly and consistently in the Parliamentary debate.
“For the Bishops the issue now is not primarily one of protections and exemptions for people of faith, important though it is to get that right, not least where teaching in schools and freedom of speech are concerned.
"The bill now requires improvement in a number of other key respects, including in its approach to the question of fidelity in marriage and the rights of children.
“If this bill is to become law, it is crucial that marriage as newly defined is equipped to carry within it as many as possible of the virtues of the understanding of marriage it will replace.
“Our focus during committee and report stages in the coming weeks and months will be to address those points in a spirit of constructive engagement."
His comments came as the new Bishop of Manchester signalled sympathy with supporters of gay marriage.
In his first comments since he was named as replacement to Rt Rev Nigel McCulloch, who recently retired, he said that the bill was flawed but added: “I fully understand why in a society where for so long gay people have been subjected to such abuse and ill treatment many people say if they are asking for equality in the area of marriage that is something they can get.”
He added: “I can see why in our society many people now – the majority of people – think that if this will help them to feel less badly treated then let them have it.”
Bishop Walker, who is currently the Bishop of Dudley – a junior bishop in the diocese of Worcester – attracted headlines earlier this year when he took on David Cameron over welfare cuts and accused politicians of scaremongering over immigration.
It emerged last month that Manchester Diocese, one of the biggest dioceses in the Church of England, had included a requirement to foster better links with the city's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities as part of its new bishop's job description.
20th Anniversary Beer and Party
Hi friends,
As you know, we're celebrating our 20th anniversary this year. We've hosted contests, commissioned custom artwork and reminisced about our humble beginnings. But, what would a celebration be without BEER?!
Following on the heels of Deca for our 10-year anniversary, Bolt Cutter for our 15th, we're happy to share our 20th anniversary beer…
Tank Bender
eisbock aged in bourbon barrels
Tank Bender is our first foray into the rare style known as eisbock. This style involves freezing water off the beer, resulting in ultra-concentrated flavor, deeper body and, in our case, a bent tank from collapsing ice. A liberal addition of Munich malt highlights the toasty and dark fruit notes while a stay in bourbon barrels tames those intense flavors. Tank Bender comes in at 15% ABV.
We will be selling special Tank Bender bottles and gift sets on-site at the brewery. They will be sold near our Education entrance off of Williams St. beginning at 10am on October 14 and running through 11pm or until we run out – whichever comes first.
First come, first served – that's right – this should hearken back to the good ol' days.
There will be two options: 750mL individual bottle ($20 each) OR a gift set, which includes (1) 750mL bottle, (2) commemorative glasses, a custom box and booklet ($60 each). Each customer will be limited to purchasing either (3) 750mL bottles OR (2) 750mL bottle and (1) gift set.
Tank Bender will also be on draft during the party. Details below.
Save the date for our 20th anniversary party! We'll be celebrating in our taproom as well as the street out front
October 14, 2017.
No cover charges.
Party starts at 1pm in both the taproom and the street out front. We'll close the outdoor party at 11pm and continue in the taproom until 2am.
Live music from the FBC All Stars and more!
Food trucks and special offerings from the Founders deli.

Finishing touches are being put to Anfield's Main Stand expansion which will complete the project over the coming weeks.
The home and away team dressing rooms were the final areas to be completed and were used for the first time during the Merseyside derby last month.
Construction work on the Main Stand started back in January 2015 and it was officially opened 614 days later when the Reds thumped Leicester City 4-1 on September 10, 2016.
As a result of the additional 8,500 seats in the Main Stand, the attendance at Anfield this season has averaged over 53,000 and every game has been a sell-out.
Andy Hughes, Liverpool FC's chief operating officer, said: “We're absolutely delighted with the success of the Main Stand expansion project. The feedback from supporters has been incredible. For a construction project of this scale to come in on time and on budget is an outstanding achievement by everyone involved.”
It's going to be another busy summer for the club this time around with further construction projects taking place at Anfield over the closed season.
Work will start on increasing the number of wheelchair bays from 195 to more than 250 positions, adding more than 150 extra amenities and easy access seats around the stadium, improving viewing positions for visiting disabled supporters, and creating new raised disabled bays in the Centenary Stand for home disabled supporters.
A new pitch will also be installed over the summer, which will improve the playing surface and overall quality of the pitch ready for the new season. Outside of the stadium, construction work is continuing on Anfield's multi-million pound flagship store with the main structural work completed in preparation for opening at the start of next campaign.
Hughes added: “It's important that we continue to invest across the club and develop our infrastructure and facilities.
“The Anfield Road Stand also provides opportunities to further develop our stadium in the future. We always said that we would complete the Main Stand and assess its success before looking at any development for Anfield Road. Our outline planning consent expires in August 2019 and we will follow the same robust process for Anfield Road as we did for the Main Stand.
“We are currently working up design, feasibility, cost, capacity and economic viability options. Only once we have completed this comprehensive process and come to a conclusion will it be the right time to move forward with any development programme.
“In addition to all the work happening at the stadium over the summer, we will also look to submit a planning application to develop our site at Kirkby to bring our first team and Academy football training operations and facilities together.
“All these developments are an important part of the club's strategy to continuously improve and ultimately support the team and further attract players. Equally, we must also continue to manage our operations of the club and maintain the financial stability everyone has worked so hard to establish.”
Note: This article was first published on February 9, 2017 and is being republished today as India's human rights record will be examined at the UN Human Rights Council for the third time under the Universal Periodic Review process on May 4. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi will be leading the Indian delegation.
New Delhi: In three months, India will be under the microscope of the international community on its domestic human rights performance by taking part in Universal Periodic Review process for the third time.
Reflecting the fact that Internet-related issues have now entered mainstream discourse, with digital policy now becoming a mainstay of the NDA government's agenda, New Delhi's self-appraisal publication will for the first time talk about online censorship, surveillance and privacy rights.
Notably, a draft of the publication states that India's mass surveillance project, the Centralised Monitoring System, will be fully operational by the first quarter of 2017.
The UPR review process is based on three documents, two of which are compilations of information provided by UN bodies, special procedures and civil society organisations. The third one – the national report – has to be submitted by the state under review of its domestic human rights laws and implementation.
India made its draft national report public in January, as part of the process to finalise its content. While the ministry of external affairs is the coordinator for the UPR exercise, the report has been compiled with the assistance of the National Law University and line ministries.
The outline of the report were broadly similar to the previous editions, but with some tweaking which include inclusion of ‘cross-cutting issues' such as Inclusive development, Climate Change and “Human Rights and Counter-terrorism”.
A completely new topic introduced in this draft report is on the role of the state in controlling the Internet, with two dedicated sub-sections under the title of “Fundamental Freedoms and Participation in Public and Political Life”. They were part of the overarching framework of “Civil and Political Rights”.
“India recognizes the importance of extending free speech guarantees to activities on the internet,” the report said, before segueing into the need to control “misuse of the Internet for inciting violence, spreading rumours and hatred or committing other illegal activities”.
“In order to prevent arbitrary use of this power to block content on the internet, the Supreme Court of India has put in place various adequate procedural safeguards such as the right to appeal a blocking decision, and the requirement for reasons in writing for issuing a blocking order,” asserted the report. A footnote refers to the Supreme Court's interim measure in the 2013 landmark case which stopped any arrests under Section 66A of the information technology act; the latter of which was eventually wholly struck down.
CMS now online
The subsequent section in the report is labelled ‘Right to Privacy and Surveillance', which asserts that the government has an implicit right to surveillance due to security concerns. The government mentions the setting up the “Centralised Monitoring System” to automate the “lawful interception and monitoring of telecommunications” – that is, voice and data records over mobile phones, landlines and internet.
New Delhi reiterates in the draft national report that there are enough safeguards to address “concerns about privacy and freedom of speech”, noting that the surveillance program “furthers” India's national security interests.
“India believes that its surveillance programme furthers its national security interests, and that safeguards in the law, including safe transmission of content, requirement for authorization from senior officials, and the existence of a Review Committee to oversee such authorisations, are sufficient to address concerns regarding privacy and freedom of speech,” the report stated.
An Oct 2016 stakeholder's report by the NGO Internet Democracy Project on India's UPR mentioned the apprehensions about the scope of CMS. “No information has been made available about whose data will be collected, how the collected will be used, or how long the data will be retained,” it pointed out.
The report also states that the CMS “is likely to be completely operationalised in first quarter of 2017”. This is the first time that the government has given a relatively firm date for operationalisation in two years.
In December 2015, Ravi Shankar Prasad had told Lok Sabha that the CMS will be “progressively operationalised from the end of the financial year”. Then in April 2016, Prasad told Lok Sabha in another written answer that the Centre Monitoring Centre in Delhi and the Regional Monitoring Centres in Delhi and Mumbai have been operationalised, while the others are being opened in a phased manner.
Why delays?
Why did it take until 2017 for the system to become wholly operational? Multiple sources tell The Wire that while the major areas of Delhi, Kolkata and Maharashtra were quickly covered, other zones such as Haryana and Madhya Pradesh (states with notoriously low-quality digital infrastructure) took longer for integration. One senior government official even suggested that delays in quick operationalisation were caused by concern that some of the surveillance equipment was of Chinese-origin, although this could not be independently confirmed by The Wire.
The government in the past, reiterating points made in its UPR document, has also told parliament that privacy concerns emanating from the CMS would be taken care due to oversight mechanism and an “inbuilt” check and balance between the security agencies and provisioning agencies.
The draft report – made public last month – also announces that possible misuse of the surveillance program could be offset by a new law. “However, in recognition of the potential of such a system to impinge on the freedom of speech, the Government is in the process of legislating on right to privacy,” the draft report asserted.
This anodyne reassurance, however, does not present a full picture.
Privacy experts say that there are two major problems with India's submission to the United Nations. Firstly, the government, through Attorney General Mukul Rohatagi, has argued before the Supreme Court that India has no “fundamental right to privacy”. This argument, crucially and ironically, took place during a three-justice bench hearing on potential privacy violations emanating from the Aadhaar project.
“Violation of privacy doesn't mean anything because privacy is not a guaranteed right,” the Attorney General was reported to have said. And yet, the Indian government has maintained, both through this UN draft report and at other public forums on the record, that it plans on passing new legislation that will enshrine a right to privacy'.
Secondly, India's privacy bill has been in cold storage from 2014, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the matter. For most of 2016 it has gone back and forth between the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), which initially drafted the bill back in 2010 just after the Radia tapes controversy, and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) From 2010, however, it is widely understood that various intelligence agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau have resisted full-fledged privacy legislation.
Indeed, over the last six months, officials within Deity feel that amended the Information Technology Act, 2000 is a surer bet. In the wake of demonetisation and various large-scale cybersecurity incidents, there is already a team that is working on strengthening provisions related to cyberattacks and cybercrime; the thinking appears to be that a few provisions on data protection and surveillance safeguards can be added.

This is the third time that India's domestic human rights record will be scrutinised by peers at Geneva – the previous instances had been in 2008 and 2012. India's date to get her human rights report card is the afternoon of May 4. Both of India's first and second UPR presentation was led by Attorney General Goolam Vahanvati. The troika of states, who facilitated India's review, at the first cycle was Ghana, Indonesia and the Netherlands, while Kuwait, Mexico and Mauritius were selected from a draw of lots at the second cycle. The current troika for India's third UPR cycle are Latvia, South Africa and Philippines.
According to a database maintained by non-profit organisation UPR info, 75 states had made 200 recommendations to India in the last two cycles.
As per UNHRC resolution, states under review can “accept” or “note” recommendations, but cannot reject them. Out of 200 recommendations received in last two cycles, India has accepted 30.5 percent, while the rest fall in the “noted” bracket. This is in contrast to the cumulative acceptance rate of 73.19 percent for all recommendations.
The Geneva-based NGO has developed a method to categorise the recommendations made by the states based on the action requested, ranging in scale from category 1 for minimal action to category 5 which lists specific action.
None of the 61 recommendations that India “accepted” in last two cycles called for a “specific action”. The “noted” recommendation mainly dealt with taking particular steps like ratification of Convention against Torture, protection against Enforced Disappearances, abolition of death penalty and anti-conversion laws, end of discrimination based on sexual orientation and repeal the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or join the International Criminal Court.
At a debate on UPR process in the human rights council, India's permanent representative, Ajit Kumar had batted strongly against suggestions to review the mechanism as it was ‘losing its steam'. “We reiterate that the UPR mechanism should not be tinkered with as any such attempt carries the potential of diluting the universal support that it currently enjoys. This process is less than ten years old, and hence, it is too early to pronounce on its ultimate effectiveness or to identify need for reforms,” he said in September 2016.
Kumar strictly objected to any “attempts” to violate the rules and regulation of UPR. “Pressurizing member states to focus on selected areas of concern can turn counter-productive by adversely affecting a country's voluntary and objective participation,” he added.
The senior diplomat made it clear that India's affection for the UPR process is due to its non-intrusive nature. “The primary reason for universal participation in the UPR process is the policy space this mechanism provides to the member states with regard to their final decisions on the recommendations, taking into account their respective social, political and economic circumstances,” he said.
On the National report, Kumar had said that it was a “matter of concern that some doubts have been raised regarding the content and methodology of national reports prepared by the States under Review.” This was “avoidable” as states “do their utmost” to have a broad consultation to draft the report, he claimed. Besides the inclusion of the section on internet speech and censorship, India's draft 2017 national report also has some other tweaks from the 2012 edition. There is no section on “recent developments” like in the 2012 report had talked about terrorists attacks and Maoists, with the need for civil society to build pressure to eschew violence.
Unlike the last report, New Delhi does acknowledge the work of human rights defenders, adding that the government is “committed to ensuring a safe working environment for people engaged in promoting and protection of human right”.
But, the 2017 draft report added a qualification: “At the same time, India believes that the activities of the human rights defenders should be in conformity with the legal framework of the land and the rights guaranteed by our Constitution”. With AFSPA expected to be brought up again during the review process, India has a substantive section dedicated to defend the continued application. India has argued that judiciary has upheld AFSPA's constitutionality and laid down guidelines for exercise of this act.
At the end of the report, a table lists out the government's specific response and implementation of the specific recommendations obtained in 2012. The Vatican had suggested strengthening the Indian government's guarantee of “freedom of religion to everyone in the world's largest democracy”.
Repeating the text from the main body of the report, India responded that anti-conversion laws were an “as an important safeguard against coercion and inducement to convert or reconvert from one religion to another in a multi-religious society”.
Noting that standard operating procedures to deal with communal violence had been laid down, the draft report then informs the international community that steps were being taken to against so-called Gau Rakshaks. “To protect against vigilante groups and miscreants that seek to disrupt law and order and communal harmony under the guise of cow protection, the Government has issued an advisory to states to take strict action in such matters,” it said.

Watch as Saturn's Rhea steals a star from the sky for nearly a minute on the evening of Friday September 12th.
Rarely does a planetary moon occult a bright star, but Saturn's Rhea is likely to do just that on Friday evening September 12th for skywatchers across much of the eastern U.S. and Ontario.
Thumbing back through my memory, I can't recall ever seeing this rarity. Hmmm ... I must have some reason to fly to New York that evening.
For those in the lucky locations, a clear sky and modest telescope are all you'll need.
One challenge will be to scout out an observing site with an open view to the southwest, where Saturn will be low. Stray clouds or dense haze might also be deterrents, but I trust you'll persevere.
If you're lucky, you'll see 10.2-magnitude Rhea black out 7.6-magnitude SAO 159034 for up to 58 seconds — depending on how far you are from the center of the shadow path — between 8:38 and 8:39 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. While Saturn's low altitude likely means soft images from air turbulence, the vanishing of the star should be obvious in a 60-mm telescope.
The occultation map below is only the most-likely case; "The prediction is quite uncertain," says David Dunham of the International Occultation Timing Association;
"It's possible that the actual southern limit will pass almost entirely north of the Earth, so that even observers in the Northeast would have a miss, but it's also possible that it will shift south; even observers in Florida have a chance for an occultation. The dotted line parallel to the southern limit and south of it, passing approximately from Houston to Orlando, is the southern limit in case of a 1-sigma southward shift of the path, considering the various prediction errors; there is a 16% chance that the path would shift at least that far south (and an equal chance that it will shift at least a similar distance north). The chance that the occultation will occur somewhere entirely between the two dotted lines is 68%."
Still, all of us will get to see the Saturnian system temporarily invaded by a bright star posing as a moon, whether there's a hit or a miss. As Rhea and Saturn go their separate ways, SAO 159034 will appear to slowly drift away from the planet, soon giving itself away as an intruder.
We know Rhea's diameter with precision thanks to 10 years of observations by the orbiting Cassini probe, but new information about the occulted star may come to light. Although SAO 159034 is listed as a single star, occultations can sometimes reveal that seemingly solitary stars have extremely close companions that reveal themselves as stepwise drops of the star's light.
However you enjoy the event, consider that Rhea, at 949 miles (1,528 km) across, will perform that favorite occultation sleight of hand where the little guy gets to eclipse the big guy, in this case a star estimated at some 121 million miles (195 million km) across.

Got to give a shout out to the Everton fans following our 3-1 loss to them last night.
The Toffees fans came in great numbers as they always do (and as us Villans on the road always do) and of course, the usual banter songs of going down were sung… we`d be doing the same so no good getting offended and also, it isn`t anything we don`t already know to be fair!
Anyway, remembering this is the most played game in the league because of the age of both these esteemed clubs, as the match progressed they got slightly quieter. We were joking where I sit that we were so bad that we`d shocked the Everton fans into silence.
The Villa fans started to sing anti Randy and anti Tom Fox songs and then pretty much all around the ground came out a rallying call, Villa til I die which hopefully reminds the owner, the board, the manager, the players… they come, they go… WE STAY.
I looked over at the Everton fans and they were standing and clapping the Villa fans.
A fantastic touch of respect. Proper fans recognising proper fans. As another also noted in the forum, it is these ‘little` but special moments that remind me why I love football so much.
Respect!
Neil Lennon took charge at Bolton after leaving Celtic in 2014
Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist thinks that Neil Lennon could return to Celtic should Ronny Deila exit the Scottish champions as team boss.
Lennon left Bolton Wanderers on Tuesday with his side sitting bottom of the English Championship.
It came amid continued speculation about Deila's future at Celtic Park.
"If Celtic do change their manager, I think Neil Lennon would certainly be a possibility," said McCoist. "He did an exceptional job at Celtic."
Lennon was a Celtic manager from 2010-14, winning the Scottish title three times, and duelling with McCoist during the latter's first season in charge at Ibrox.
Celtic won the title after Rangers squandered a 15-point lead amid a financial crisis that led to them playing in Scotland's bottom tier the following season.
Lennon has experienced a similar scenario at Bolton, the 44-year-old's departure by "mutual consent" coming five days after the Sports Shield consortium completed a takeover of the club that has been close to administration.
Sympathy for Lennon
"I for one could sympathise and understand what Neil Lennon's been going through more than most in terms of his managerial job in the last year or so," McCoist told BBC Radio 5 live.
Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist were in opposite dugouts with Glasgow rivals Celtic and Rangers
"Our own club went into administration then liquidation. You get players turning up and they don't know if they're going to get paid.
"There are restrictions on you all over the place. It is an extremely difficult job."
Despite his side continuing to lead the Scottish Premiership, Deila has come under pressure, especially after his side's poor results in Europe this season, their defeat by Ross County in the semi-final of the League Cup and Aberdeen narrowing the gap to one point at the top of the table.
Former Celtic players David Moyes, the former Everton and Manchester United boss recently sacked by Real Sociedad, and Malky Mackay, the former Watford, Cardiff City and Wigan Athletic manager, have both been linked with the job with the reigning champions.
However, former Northern Ireland and Celtic midfielder Lennon has now been made favourite by some bookmakers to succeed Deila.
Sympathy for Ronny Deila
"Now that he has moved on, is there a possibility he could go back to Celtic? I would have to say yes," said McCoist.
Ronny Deila's side are one point ahead of Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership
"The current manager at Celtic is a man I have a great deal of sympathy for because, no matter what he does, it is probably not going to be enough.
"Scottish football for the last three or four years has been in an absolutely bizarre situation when nobody really knows what's good and what's bad and what's indifferent."
McCoist thinks the Norwegian is the victim of a lack of real competition at the top of the Scottish game.
"Both cups are held by teams in the Highlands," he said of County's victory in Sunday's League Cup final, which followed last season's lifting of the Scottish Cup by neighbours Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
"It is a fairytale story, but it does tell you more about the lack of strength among the big guns than anything else.
"For us as a country to have three of our biggest clubs out the top division last season, I don't think we are a strong enough footballing nation to have that.
"And the sooner Rangers, Celtic, Hearts, Hibs and Aberdeen are back in the top flight together the better."
With the announcement of the United States Treasury taking steps to curb inversion deals that will allow companies to avoid the high U.S. taxes, shares of AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE: AZN) and Shire PLC (ADR)(NASDAQ: SHPG) have dropped drastically.
With the Treasury department intervening, agreed deals like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) buying Shire for $55 billion and the deal between Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and AstraZeneca are now in jeopardy. Both AstraZeneca and Shire combined have lost $8 billion in market value since President Obama shed light on the negative effects of companies doing tax inversion deals.
Many investors had expected the Obama administration to step in, and they were correct. The administration started mentioning how companies that are reincorporating should be to blame for America's economy. The tax inversion deals are now the top priority for Democrats all over the country, while the Republicans believe that other issues are more important at the moment.
Navid Malik, head of Life Science researches at Cenkos Securities said that with the administrations putting a black cloud on those companies who are trying to dodge the high American tax rate. “Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off,” said Malik.
The Treasury is also limiting levels of ownership that the former U.S. owners have once they reincorporate elsewhere. The issue now is finding a way to help companies incorporating in America and doing it while paying lower tax rates. Look at tax inversions to be an important topic for both parties in upcoming elections.
Scans have confirmed defender Steven Morris has ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during the first quarter of Friday night's game against North Melbourne.
The injury will end the 27-year-old's 2016 season, and he will undergo surgery in the coming weeks.
“The injury is disappointing for Steve, he's a tough competitor and been playing great football this season,” Dan Richardson, Richmond's General Manager of Football said.
“It's never easy to see a player go down with a long-term injury, but Steve is a resilient person and we'll support him throughout the rehab process.”
Ben Griffiths has a lateral ligament sprain in his right ankle, the Club will assess his improvement over the course of the week.
Defender Dylan Grimes was a late change in Friday night's match after feeling hamstring soreness in the warm-up.
Grimes will need to train fully this week to be available to play in this Sunday's match against the Gold Coast Suns.
Nick Vlastuin's night ended at half-time of Friday night's match after the young defender suffered concussion.
Vlastuin will need to pass the standard concussion tests later this week to be medically cleared to play this weekend.
I can't imagine what it's like to be sexually attracted to children. To look at the leg of an eight year old and feel a swell of desire. To find the children's clothing section of catalogues alluring. I find the concept alien and disturbing.
If you were to tell me that there was a programme I could go on that would make me become sexually attracted to children I doubt it would succeed. But even if it did, I would still have a choice about acting on that desire.
This is how sexual desire works for all of us. The nature of our sexual desire does not come with a switch that you can simply flick on and off. You can no more make me become a paedophile as you can turn paedophilia off in someone else. And in a similar way that none of us choose to be attracted to men or women, paedophiles do not choose to be attracted to children. It's something they realise about themselves. But having had that realisation they do face a choice. They get to decide whether to act on their sexual desires, or not.
On Tuesday night, a self-confessed paedophile, Eddie, 39, who has never acted on his desires, is going to out himself in a Channel 4 documentary – in a bid to ask for more help for people sexually attracted to children. It's a brave move, which I support whole-heartedly.
Paedophilia is a sexual interest in children who have not gone through puberty. Officially a psychiatric disorder under DSM-5, it's a condition that can affect people from early adolescence onwards. Some paedophiles meet the criteria for diagnosis because they have committed sex offences against children. Others meet it because their attraction to children causes them distress. For this latter group, of which Eddie is a member, their paedophilia is completely legal. The law does not sanction sexual desire. Laws are made around what we do with our desires. The paedophile who never acts on their desire is a law abiding member of the community. The paedophile who does act on their desire becomes a sex offender and rightly faces the full consequences of our criminal justice system.
So why should we care about ‘non-offending' paedophiles, like Eddie? Shouldn't we just wish them out of existence like we do with sex offenders? Shouldn't we find the risk they pose to our children too much to tolerate?
On the contrary, the risk they pose is the very reason why we need to support paedophiles who don't want to become sex offenders. We all want the same thing. We don't want them to offend. Their potential victims don't want them to offend. And miraculously they don't want to offend. But what they are living with can be distressful and hard to manage. They need support and therapy. They need to learn how to live with their sexual desire in a way that keeps them offence-free.
Without our support these people are likely to remain underground. They may find that the only place they can find sanctuary and understanding is with sex offenders. And in the worst-case scenario they may decide to commit an offence in order to get the help that they want.
There is no paedophile switch for society. We can't just switch them off or wish them away. For the sake of their potential victims we urgently need to learn how support those amongst them who never want to offend.

Are you online looking for something interesting, newsworthy, inspirational, or merely useful in some way in the music media? You may be looking for a long time, because, well, those things are hidden beneath other, more pressing matters. If you've read Ryan Holiday's book “Trust Me, I'm Lying”, you'd be familiar with the fact that our current mainstream music media (music and otherwise) and blogosphere want to polarize issues, trivial gossip and controversial content, whether it's true or not. Rage pays. Apologies, corrections and updates simply mean more traffic at a later date.
Many comments on music blog's features add up to “Is this really newsworthy?” and “Why would you guys post this?” as of late. We look for music news and instead we're faced with endless posts such as “Earl Sweatshirt trashes Jay-Z” (shouldn't that be between them?) or “Bieber did WHAT off a balcony?” (from the Huffington Post today. I'm still not sure what he did), meant to anger us so that we click. Once we click, nothing more is needed of us. We realize that we've been had and the site earns. Two days after Earl Sweatshirt trashes Jay-Z, he announces his new album. What a particularly sad promotional trick. Who's time was wasted? Ours.
Traffic is the currency, from the bottom to the top, and your success often depends on what you're willing to do to get it. Gossip magazines used to be something people would purchase in the same way as, say, condoms or rash cream. Throw a few other items in the mix and hope it goes unnoticed. Now, the internet keeps our squeamishness intact and everyone engages. It's gone mainstream, from the very highest to the smallest. Traffic means advertising, after all.
Until someone (come on, Google) comes up with an internet filter where we can block certain things from our viewing (to remove, say, Lana Del Rey from our news feeds for example), we'll have to contend with this trend. To make things entertaining, I thought I'd Google a particularly silly piece of news that made the rounds worldwide. Miley Cyrus “twerking”. I must admit, when this first started showing up on just about every music blog I frequent, I didn't read, and still haven't read, any of the articles on the subject…because personally, I just don't care, not to say that you shouldn't. In this list you'll see initial posts by major publications, which pave the way for endless follow-up posts. This is a technique often used to gain more traffic. Spread something apparently scandalous and put celebrities in the position of defending themselves. Bandwagon hopefuls get involved, too.
If you were recently promoting a major event, a charitable cause, an important piece of news, a groundbreaking company, or artist, and wondering why appealing to the mainstream media was so difficult, this is why. This is what gets the hits.
The Guardian features a headline saying “Nicki Minaj reminds Miley Cyrus that she can twerk in the pool”, while The Huffington Post highlighted a piece on Demi Lovato and how she “avoids twerking”.

This case study is one of thousands of examples. I don't want to name names, but your favorite music blog's news feed probably has many similar “stories”.
What's the positive side?
There are many publications who provide excellent content, such as Consequence of Sound, Pop Matters, The Quietus or Pitchfork, and of course, thousands of smaller publications. Focus on them for your press needs, and don't give gossip rags your valuable hits. Once you click, they've made money from their advertisers. Support the blogs you feel are doing good work. Give THEM the traffic. Next time you see a great music feature, take the time to comment. Share it. Resist the urge to click on the next “beef” piece. Contribute to the culture by starting a quality blog of your own. It's up to us how we communicate with each other and what we cover. Things change depending on the choices we make every day, and you're your own filter.
For being a true conservative, Donald Trump sure has funneled a lot of cash to prominent liberal Democrats over the years.
The billionaire media mogul has flirted with presidential politics before. But this time, he's finally going for it. Yesterday, Donald Trump officially announced that he's running for president.
During a press conference at Trump Tower, the Donald declared that the nation needs someone to “take the brand of the United States and make it great again.” Mr. Trump knows something about rebranding. He's done a lot of it over the past few years.
On the conservative speaking circuit, Trump has stumped for the support of the base. Railing against the Obama administration, he has styled himself as a foreign policy hawk with social conservative sensibilities.
But a closer look at his history reveals that Trump has been more politically promiscuous than his recent rhetoric would suggest.
Here are 23 Democrats who have handsomely profited from Trump dollars over the last two decades.
1. Hillary Clinton
Trump wanted New York to hire Clinton when she was running for The senate. He personally donated $15,500 to his potential Democratic presidential rival.
2. Charlie Rangel
Censured by the House Ethics Committee, Harlem's Charles Rangel still secured $20,350 over the years from Donald Trump.
3. Chuck Schumer
New York's Charles Schumer raked in $9,900 in Trump cash.
4. Harry Reid
For several years, Trump has supported the senator most responsible for the passage of ObamaCare. Harry Reid has collected $9,400 from Trump.
5. John Kerry
Until Senator Kerry launched his campaign for president in 2004, Trump regularly bankrolled the Massachusetts senator's campaigns to the tune of$5,500.
6. Anthony Weiner
Before the Twitter selfies, Trump pumped up Weiner's political ambitions with $4,300 in campaign contributions.
7. Tom Daschle
The former Senate Majority Leader who nearly become Obama's HHS secretarytook $4,000 from Trump.
8. Joe Biden
Before Senator Biden moved onto the White House, Trump helped him move into the Senate with a generous $1,000 check.
9. Chris Dodd
Co-author of the Dodd-Frank Law that bears his name, the Connecticut senator accepted $3,000 from Trump.
10. Joe Lieberman
The Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, Lieberman has collected $23,000 from Trump over the years.
11. Ted Kennedy: $6,000
12. Dick Durbin: $1,500
13. Frank Lautenberg: $7,000
14. Robert E. Andrews: $6,900

“Russell! Hey, Russell!” cries a crowd of eager children on a warm June morning in Richmond.
They jostle to get closer to the fence of the Tuckahoe Sports complex, necks craning upward, their faces flushed with anticipation. Russell Wilson is about to take the field.
The 2014 Super Bowl-winning quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks is back in his hometown for the fifth year of the Russell Wilson Passing Academy, a one-day football camp for kids ages 8 to 17, the third stop on the camp's six-city tour across the U.S. and Canada.
Marc and Eileen Molina have driven their 8-year-old son, Marc Jr., all the way from Union City, New Jersey, to attend the camp, confessing, “We told him Russell checks the grades, and if he got honors he would get to go to camp.” The Molinas are among the more than 350 kids and parents who have gathered here today, including Trish Werner of Richmond and her 11-year-old son, Will, who plays for the Tuckahoe Tomahawks—the same youth football team Wilson played for as a boy before going on to Collegiate School, where he led the Cougars to state championships in 2005 and 2006, and was twice named the Richmond Times-Dispatch's athlete of the year.
For these kids, Wilson's success on the field has made him a hero—for their parents, that success combined with Wilson's easy confidence and focus on all-American values has made him a role model. He's the real deal.But before the now 25-year-old Wilson became a hero, before he won the Super Bowl, before he was named to two Pro Bowls, before he won Rookie of the Year and before he was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks, he was considered by NFL scouts to be just too short, at 5-feet 10 inches, to succeed as a pro quarterback. “He's too short! He's too short! He's too damn short!” said ESPN analyst and former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach John Gruden in 2012, mocking the litany of preseason draft reports.
For all the sports writers and draft wonks who doubted, there were people closer to Wilson who did not. “It was pretty clear from the get-go how good he was. He was always very competitive. I always thought he was going to be in the NFL,” says Cole Hawthorne, Wilson's friend and teammate at Collegiate with whom he and a third friend, Scott Pickett, founded the Passing Academy after graduating from high school in 2007.
“Russell was a tremendous leader,” says Charlie McFall, Wilson's football coach at Collegiate for three years. (Wilson also starred in baseball and basketball.) “The way he carried himself, he earned the respect of not only his own team, but of the opposition.” McFall remembers that even in the most heated of rivalries (“there was some bad blood,” he says), after the game, opposing players would leave their animosity on the field to give him a genuine band-of-brothers slap on the shoulder pads.
Wilson didn't play organized football until the 6th grade, showing up to a Friday night practice for the Tuckahoe Tomahawks because one of his baseball coaches asked him to stand in for a big game the next day. “On the very first play, our starting quarterback got knocked out of the game. The coach sent me in to play quarterback,” says Wilson. “I told him, ‘I don't know any of the plays.' He just told me to do the best I could. Well, I drew plays in the grass and just improvised my way through. I ended up throwing six touchdown passes, and we won by 45 points.”
Even if his athleticism came naturally, many of the traits to which Wilson attributes his success were learned from his parents, Harrison Wilson III, a lawyer who died from diabetes complications in 2010, and Tammy Wilson, a legal nurse consultant. “Our dinner conversations always centered around three major themes—faith, family and education,” says Wilson. “We talked about role models, all the way across the board, from Martin Luther King Jr. to Derek Jeter. These were role models that lived the life that my parents wanted for my brother, sister and me.”
Though he was offered a major league baseball contract directly out of high school (and would even spend the last two summers of college playing minor league baseball in the Colorado Rockies organization), Wilson decided against professional baseball to attend N.C. State, to play both football and baseball, largely at the urging of his father, who was insistent that his son go to college. At N.C. State, Wilson made a promise to his father that he would graduate in three years—a promise he fulfilled. He then played a final season at the University of Wisconsin, setting a school record for passing touchdowns in a single season and leading the Badgers to the Rose Bowl.
Education and athletics have always gone hand-in-hand for the family. Harrison Wilson Jr., Wilson's grandfather, (who served as the president of Norfolk State University from 1975-1997), played basketball, baseball and football at Kentucky State University. Both Wilson's father and brother were multi-sport athletes at Dartmouth College and the University of Richmond, respectively, and his sister Anna, one of the top-ranked basketball recruits in the country, will graduate from Collegiate in 2016 with a scholarship offer to attend Stanford University already sealed.
After lunch, the campers crowd around Wilson, reaching out for a fist bump or a high five. “Were you nervous before the Super Bowl?” one boy asks. “No, not at all. I never get nervous before games. God's given me a tremendous ability to play the game of football. It's a game. It's a game that I love, that I put all my work and energy into, and it's also my job, but I don't look at the game of football as life and death.”
The kids are quiet as he continues. “I think about my dad getting sick, my mom having to take care of him, my dad passing away. That's pressure, and I feel like a game is supposed to be fun. Being out here with you guys, jumping up and down, throwing the football, enjoying this game is what it's all about.”
Does it feel the same for Wilson to step out onto the field now as it did when he was a kid? “I love the energy of the game. That has never changed for me. I love competing …. It's always been the same. I just love the game. That's every single day.”

IRVING, TX—According to sources within ExxonMobil's global headquarters, Rex W. Tillerson, the company's president, chairman, and CEO, was completely devastated Wednesday by what 18-year-old Skidmore College freshman Samantha Huestis was saying about him in her dorm room.
After aides abruptly pulled the 58-year-old executive out of a deepwater-exploration meeting, Tillerson was said to have gasped audibly and shaken his head in apparent despair when notified that the communications major had charged ExxonMobil with "raping the environment" and had claimed that Tillerson himself "only cares about money."
Advertisement
"I've never been so hurt in all my life," said Tillerson, who is worth an estimated $720 million. "For Samantha to lie on her bed and tell Kaylee, Ben, and even Becky Stanmore—the dorm's RA, for Christ's sake—that I am poisoning the planet…it's just tearing me apart inside."
"How could she say those things?" continued Tillerson, his voice breaking. "A heartless capitalist? Is that all I am to her? I actually feel sick to my stomach. I don't know what else to say."
Advertisement
Sources confirmed that upon hearing that Samantha called him "a greedy bastard," Tillerson drew the blinds of his spacious corner office and sat in stunned silence for several minutes before meekly requesting that his secretary hold any incoming calls and cancel all his meetings and appearances for the remainder of the week.
When informed that roommate Jenny Gagnon bolstered Huestis' tirade by connecting ExxonMobil's carbon emissions with the plight of polar bears, the leader of the world's largest publicly traded oil company report≠edly buried his head in his hands and re≠peated the phrase "This can't be happening."
"He's really taking the news hard," said executive assistant Pam Geary, who admitted that Huestis' attacks on ExxonMobil's environmental record, executive pay practices, and public skepticism of climate-change science had shocked Tillerson, causing him to wonder aloud how Huestis could be so cruel. "When he heard that Samantha called the company evil, the poor guy went white as a sheet and just slumped in his chair. It was heartbreaking. Truly heartbreaking."

Fearing that this could be "the beginning of the end" for the world's third-largest corporation, Tillerson told reporters he was considering giving Huestis a call at her work-study job to smooth things over. Tillerson also discussed taking his private Learjet to Saratoga Springs to confront Samantha during her intramural broomball game about why she called ExxonMobil "a shitty company," but his associates advised against it.
Throughout the course of the day, Tillerson grew increasingly worried as he agonized over what could happen if the undergraduate ever posted her anti-oil views on Facebook, sources reported.
"How can I possibly move on from this?" said Tillerson, who canceled a lunch date with hedge-fund manager John Paulson and Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, stating that he had lost his appetite. "Sure, we recorded more than $9 billion in profits last quarter and our stock price is near an all-time high, but that doesn't mean anything anymore—not when Samantha thinks I'm selfish."

By early evening, after reportedly cycling through a range of emotions from humiliation to anger to despair, Tillerson acknowledged that he had begun to take Huestis' message to heart, leading him to question ExxonMobil's entire corporate mission.
"You know what, maybe she's right," said Tillerson, staring at his own image on a framed cover of Forbes magazine. "Maybe we are just a moneygrubbing octopus that doesn't care about anyone else but ourselves. I guess the only conceivable course of action is to abandon our $400-billion-a-year business model and focus exclusively on clean energy, like she suggested."
"It will certainly cost a lot of money, but it's like Samantha says: We're the most profitable corporation in the world, so what does it matter to us?" Tillerson continued. "I just hope she's willing to give me a second chance."

At press time, the Israeli government was reportedly holding its breath on word that Huestis had stopped to read a flyer for the campus group Students for Palestine.

Scrape was born as a wild, improbable idea in the mind of Terry Cook, one of Hot Rod Magazine‘s former editors. He made so many modifications to the Zephyr that the build took no less than four years to complete.
Notably, he got creative and combined different body panels from various years of the Zephyr's production run to create the exact car he dreamed up — one that Lincoln never built. He also chopped the top, and made the fenders much wider to give his creation that low-slung look hot-rodders drool over. The interior was completely redone, too. The new-look makes us want to hit the highway with our favorite roadtrip songs.
As you might have guessed, the name Scrape alludes to the custom Zephyr's ground clearance — or lack thereof. It can nonetheless drive over speed bumps without leaving a long (and expensive) trail of paint because the steel suspension was replaced by a fully-adjustable hydraulic system.
We're sure the Zephyr's 4.4-liter V12 engine was downright impressive when Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House, but it was outdated and underpowered in the 1990s, when Scrape was built. It looks like Zephyr's engine bay is now home to a more modern V8, though up-to-date technical specifications haven't been released.
Scrape has changed hands several times over the past two decades. The current owner gave it a sinister, murdered-out look by painting it deep black, tinting the headlights, and installing steel wheels with stock-looking metal hubcaps. We think it looks much better now than it did when it was purple, but to each his own. If you want to get to know our taste, check out our picks for best sports cars.
If this classic hot rod sounds like your dream ride, you're in luck. It's scheduled to cross the auction block in Santa Monica, California, on June 24. We hope you've already started saving up, because it's expected to sell for anywhere between $300,000 and $400,000, which is roughly the price of a new Lamborghini. If that's too much, rest assured the Hot Wheels version is markedly more affordable.

“I find people in the political arena are very understanding and forgiving,” former Oregon Senator Bob Packwood told me recently. We were talking about his life these days, his comfortable recovery from the tawdry headlines of 20 years ago that forced him from his job in Congress. Given the successful lobbying career that the former Republican lawmaker continues to enjoy at 81, there's substantial evidence to support his contention about Washington being a land of redemption—even absolution.
There was, after all, a lot to be forgiven when Packwood left the Senate. His drawn-out downfall came after the emergence of a good many stories of sexual harassment directed at staffers and lobbyists. One woman who worked in his office said Packwood suddenly kissed her on the neck. Soon after, he followed her into a room, stood on her feet, pulled her ponytail and tried to yank down her girdle. The woman escaped but he threatened her, saying, “If not today, some other day.” She resigned.
Story Continued Below
It wasn't just accusations of his randy behavior that ended his lawmaking career. Packwood kept a diary in which he damned himself, writing with incredulity about being rebuffed once by an employee in the copy room. “She made this big stink about it,” Packwood wrote. “I have one question—if she didn't want me to feather her nest, why did she come into the Xerox room? Sure, she used that old excuse that she had to make copies of the Brady Bill, but if you believe that, I have a room full of radical feminists you can boff.”
After the diary was subpoenaed by the Senate Ethics Committee, it was discovered that Packwood had removed some incriminating material, including threats to his colleagues (ever the confessor, he wrote in the journal about making the edits). In the end, he said, he was a victim of “dogmatic women,” and wrote in his diary that he didn't know what all the fuss was about. “I am accused of kissing women,” Packwood wrote, “on occasion of perhaps overeagerly kissing women, and that is the charge—not drugging, not robbing, kissing.”
The committee took a different view of his profligate affections and recommended unanimously that he be expelled from the Senate for ethics violations. Packwood went ahead and announced his resignation in October of 1995, leaving Congress as a “pariah in his state,” observed the New York Times. But while the lion's share of the negative publicity focused on the senator's sexual appetites, his promiscuity of a different kind—with Washington's lobbyists—was also remarkable. In one instance documented in the diary, he arranged to have a cash retainer paid to his then-wife by a lobbyist; in another entry, he pledged to a lobbyist working for Shell Oil that he'd pass a special oil tax bill to thank him for raising campaign cash. “Ron, I still hate the oil companies,” he told the gentleman, “but I'll do you a favor.”
Indeed, Packwood was in a good position to do favors. The chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, he had spent his career serving as one of those now-extinct species called a liberal Republican, currying favor with friends on both sides of the aisle—and growing powerful with the lobbying community. A spokeswoman for Shell once acknowledged in an interview that the company hired a particular lobbyist because it believed he had “a way to get in and meet with” Packwood's top staffers. Another lobbyist, according to Packwood's diary, once told the senator that he could offer Packwood's wife $37,500 for five years of part-time work, adding, “If you're chairman of the Finance Committee I can probably double that,” Packwood then became chairman of the committee, though he had his sights set on an even better job. He confided to his diary that he dreamed of working on K Street, hoping one day to “become a lobbyist at five or six or four hundred thousand” dollars annually.
He did better. Soon after departing office amid the diary scandal, Packwood founded the Sunrise Research Corporation, a lofty-sounding one-man-lobbying shop that has routinely made as much as $1 million per year for that one man, who works on issues ranging from health care to food regulations to tax policy. “My clients have come from across the political spectrum, from the AFL-CIO to United Airlines to the Court of Ohio,” he told me, explaining that he finds a way to be useful to all comers.
By any measure, life is pretty good for Packwood these days. He spends half the year in Washington—about 80 percent of the time Congress is in session—and the balance of his days in the posh Portland suburb of Dunthorpe. As a lobbyist does, he fills the weeks he's in D.C. trudging up to Capitol Hill to buttonhole congressional staffers or lawmakers. The work reminds him not of his own days in Congress, but of his first career. “It's similar to my time as a lawyer,” he says, explaining how he discerns what his clients could benefit from on the Hill and then presses their interests vigorously (“in clear, Anglo-Saxon language”). His old connections and his once-powerful perch count for very little in his new line of work, Packwood would have me believe. “There really is very little legalized bribery inside or outside Congress,” he says, and his tone is even and earnest as he says it. “I find people vastly overrate the importance of money and power.”
***
While Packwood may or may not be correct, his own success as a lobbyist suggests we overestimate something else entirely: the degree to which a scandal impedes a former member of Congress. Rather than slink away from Washington—and the local notoriety of their sins—plenty of lawmakers who've exited office under less-than-ideal circumstances have, perhaps not surprisingly, found soft landings on K Street. For instance, Senator Larry Craig, the Idaho Republican who left office after a notorious incident with an undercover cop in a bathroom stall in 2007, promptly took up work as a lobbyist, launching a firm called New West Strategies, which has earned north of $200,000 working on behalf of Murray Energy Corporation of Ohio and the veterans group Operation Military Family. Last year, he took in more than $150,000 representing Western Pacific Timber. “When you have significant experience in Congress, it's assumed you'll have clients come to you automatically,” he told a reporter. “But that's not the case, you have to hustle, and you always hustle.”

RIVER NORTH — Eataly Chicago will open Dec. 2 with a mix of imported Italian foodstuffs and locally-sourced ingredients in its two-story River North grocery and restaurant complex.
The two-story food emporium features several restaurants interspersed with grocery vendors sorted by category.
"When you taste something there, we want you to know that you can make it," co-founder and celebrity chef Mario Batali said at a media preview of the complex Monday.
The high-concept grocery store is modeled after the Eataly series in Italy and New York City, though the Chicago outpost is the biggest at 63,000 square feet.
"Our customers love that at the end of the day, when they walk out of here, they haven't spent more than they would have spent at their normal grocery store," Batali said of the high-end grocer that seeks to make gourmet ingredients and produce affordable. "And they're a little tipsy."
The store's wine section features varieties bottled especially for the Chicago eatery served in-house from wooden barrels, as well as imports. Guests are encouraged to imbibe while they shop, and pairing suggestions are highlighted at the meat, fish, bread, cheese and pasta stations.
The River North complex also hopes to attract travelers and roving diners with a gelateria, Nutella-centric snack bar and Lavazza coffee shop on the ground floor at 43 E. Ohio St.
As is tradition with the Eataly line highlighting innovators at each location, the Chicago outpost was dedicated to Ernest Hemingway at the event Monday.
West Loop Salumi's cured meats will have a featured spot inside the monolith building that once housed ESPN Zone. So will cheese from Downstate Champaign's Prairie Fruits Farm and Creamery and Ludwig Farmstead and Creamery in nearby Fithian, Ill.
Chicago's Eataly outpost will be the biggest of the franchise, which has sites in New York, Italy and Japan. Spokesman Dino Borri said that was no accident.
"Chicago is the most important city in the center of the United States," Borri said. "It's already a really important foodie city. The quality of the food there is amazing."
The Eataly concept values extremes, and specificity. Borri noted that the Eataly Chicago pasta collection will feature "over 200 shapes," many of which will be served in Eataly's interior restaurants.
The experience is modeled after the open-air Campo de Fiori market in Rome.
"Sometimes you go to the restaurant, and you taste something, and you say 'Oh my God, this is so good, I would like to buy it.' Sometimes you ask the chef, 'Where is this from?' and he'll say 'Oh the fish market down the street,'" Borri said.
"Here, you say, 'Oh, this pasta is so good, where can I buy [it]?' and they say 'Two feet over there,'" he said. "This is the beauty of our store."
In addition to curating a selection of locally sourced ingredients, Borri said Eataly Chicago will also import lots of hard-to-find products from Italy and elsewhere.
"I really think in Chicago, a store like ours will be a destination for the daily shopping of the Chicago people," Borri said. "We have some products that nobody sells right now."
Restaurants and "stations" inside will include "a new meat restaurant that we don't have yet in New York," and a "fried station, Frito, where it's all fried stuff that is really typical in South Italia, like fish fry," Borri said.
In the name of variety, many items will be available on a rotating schedule. The by-the-glass wine selection of 50 to 60 wines will change weekly, Borri said. Classes and guest lectures with "wine experts, beer experts, pasta experts" will "teach people about the history of the products, the quality of the products, when the producers are in town," and demonstrate recipes assembled entirely from Eataly's stock.
When Trek announced they had redesigned their Madone we were intrigued; when they said they had given it an aero makeover we were concerned. In gaining the ability to cheat the wind, bikes can lose the character that made them great in the first place, all for a few extra watts.
Highs: Swift and lithe – a brilliant ride
Lows: Powerful brakes take some adjustment in application
Buy if: You want a bike whose ride is as impressive as the technical know-how that went into creating it
Trek have been clever, though, using their KVF (Kammtail Virtual Foil) tube profile. This uses an aerofoil shape with a chopped-off tail that not only complies with UCI regulations but is also rigid and resists torsional twist. Crucially, ride quality is not compromised: it immediately feels very similar to the previous Madone chassis.
If anything, the oversized tapered steerer and head tube feel even more sorted. Tipping the 5.2 into high-speed corners on descents it feels planted, direct and sharply responsive, its deep down tube, massive BB90 bottom bracket shell and asymmetric seat tube allowing no unwanted flex from front to rear.
With the seatstays now slimmer and not connected at the seat joint, there's a noticeable softness to the rear end over rough surfaces, resulting in a superbly smooth and connected ride.
The frame is made from Trek's high-end 500 series OCLV carbon; considering the price we'd have expected some kit downgrades but the only deviation from Ultegra is a 105 cassette. Its 50/34 chainset and 11-28 cassette should be ample for most of us. In-house brand Bontrager provide the finishing kit, the highlight being the Race wheels – well-sealed, stiff, smooth-rolling and tubeless-ready.
Trek madone 5.2:
The compact bar and aluminium stem fit the bill, though not all of us liked the flattened section of bar near the hoods, which puts pressure on your hands on extended rides.
The dual-pivot brakes are mounted directly to the frame. They're lighter, more aero and more powerful than standard, and feel equally powerful through the lever stroke – which means a little adjustment in how you apply your brakes.
We'll admit to more than a little reticence trying out the new Madone. The old Madone was one of our favourite rides, but Trek's designers have delivered a delight, improving what was already a classic. Chapeau, Trek!

CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick talks about the return of Golden State coach, who has been out all season because of complications from offseason back surgery USA TODAY Sports
Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr made his debut Friday against the Indiana Pacers. (Photo11: AP)
OAKLAND – All those months had passed, with Steve Kerr telling Bob Myers day after day that he just wasn't ready to return to the court, and the response from the Golden State Warriors general manager to his ailing coach was always the same.
“Steve, do what's best for you,” Myers would say to Kerr. “The Warriors are going to be fine. It's a basketball game.”
Those words held true on Friday night, when Kerr coached for the first time in more than six months and the fact that the Warriors beat the Indiana Pacers to improve to a league-best 40-4 had almost nothing to do with the meaning of it all. The part that mattered most, that had Myers smiling afterwards and inspired Kerr to call his general manager “an amazing human being” before tipoff, is that he was happy and healthy again.
The Warriors' beloved coach was back doing the work he loved, this job that moves him.
Just like Myers' late brother-in-law, Scott Dinsmore, used to say.
As Kerr made his way back from complications caused by offseason back surgery, those kind and patient words from Myers had come from a place that was as special as it was sad. On Sept. 12, 2015, right about the time Kerr was deciding whether or not he'd be ready to take on the rigors of training camp while dealing with severe headaches and fatigue, the 33-year-old Dinsmore was killed by falling boulders while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro with his wife, Chelsea.
The love of her life, this passionate man whose TED talk imploring people to follow their dreams has approximately 2.6 million views and who founded a company – “Live Your Legend” – based on that uplifting principle, was just a few feet away from her on the mountain when he was taken. Their backpacking adventure around the globe had come to a tragic end. She would hike back down the mountain alone.
Chelsea Dinsmore lives in the Myers' San Francisco home now, with Bob, his wife, Kristen, and their two young daughters all trying to fill an unfillable void. As Myers searched for the right words to explain the devastation of it late Friday night, the look of anguish on his face said more than enough. He was forever changed by this.
But somewhere along the path, while Myers' family grieved and Kerr wondered how he'd gone from the NBA's mountaintop in June to a lonely hike downward of his own, these two men who had no relationship before becoming partners in May of 2014 began to lean on one another. Their bigger-than-basketball bond was born.
“We would often say that this was the best year and worst year of our lives,” Myers, who joined the Warriors in April of 2011, told USA TODAY Sports. “What he went through personally, and what I went through in a family way, it's a true statement. Only a few people knew about it, or know it, and so yeah there was a very sad common bond that we both were able to talk about and empathize.
“I'm lucky to have a guy like that in my life, who I respect and trust. He spoke to my wife and family (after Dinsmore's passing) and wrote an e-mail to them afterwards that was one of the most beautiful e-mails I've ever seen. It meant a lot to me to do that to my wife's family, so there are a lot of layers here that go deeper than (the typical) coach-GM (relationship).”
Kerr, the five-time champion as a player who served as Phoenix Suns general manager and TNT analyst before joining the Warriors, is certainly no stranger to loss. His father, Malcolm Kerr, was the president of American University in Beirut when he was assassinated on Jan. 18, 1984. Kerr, who was a star at the University of Arizona at the time, has spoken openly for years about the profound effect losing his father had on who he would later become.
But these past six months have been trying in their own right. Kerr, who spent most of his time in his San Diego home with his wife, Margot, until reappearing around the team recently, was forced to step away from this job he so dearly loves. His return date kept moving. The symptoms kept coming. Those constant chats with Myers, though, helped keep his restless mind sane.
“Bob is an amazing human being; he really is,” Kerr said. “His support is just … incredible. There (are) no conditions to it. He's going to support me and cares me and he feels that way about everybody on our team. Obviously we all want to win, but Bob is a person who has an understanding of humanity and people and family and he knows all that stuff is way more important than winning a game and it's genuine. His support has been huge for me.”
As has Kerr's for Myers.
“(The NBA is) so results oriented, and that's OK because it always will be and we signed up for that,” Myers said. “But if you can somehow, within all of the chaos, understand that there's going to be some really good days and some really hard days, have strong relationships and bonds, it makes it all that much better. That's the part that I think I'm proud of (with Kerr), and I hope he's proud of it. It is real.”
Before the past few months, through Myers' time as a high school star in nearby Danville, Calif., a member of the national champion UCLA Bruins in 1995 and his career as an NBA agent-turned-front-office-executive, he said he never considered himself the empathetic type. He was widely known as affable and very capable, to be sure, but truly understanding the trials of others, he said, was a weakness.
In this, however, there is strength. For them both.
“With these last two experiences, I have a profoundly different outlook on life based on what he went through and what I'm going through with my wife, and her parents,” Myers said. “It certainly changed me, because there are depths of emotion I hadn't gone to (before). I viewed what (Kerr) was going through in a different light too – as a person, as a friend…That will last a lot longer than whatever happens in the next year or five years.
“I always said, ‘Steve, do what's best for you. The Warriors are going to be fine. It's a basketball game. We're going to be ok. How are you?' That's what you want to get to. Hopefully we go through this together a long time, but we're not always going to be this good. We know it. And then when things are tougher, and you face adversity, having that strong bond is very meaningful.”

‘Her Body and Other Parties' by Carmen Maria Machado
This National Book Award for Fiction shortlisted book's blurb captures it best: “earthy and otherworldly, antic and sexy, queer and caustic, comic and deadly serious". Machado's debut collection is dark as it is daring and genre-defying.
‘A Life Of Adventure and Delight' by Akhil Sharma

Last week we've been experimenting with SVG paths to animate the content of a full-page hero slider. Today we use the same technique to create a responsive carousel. This time, though, we used SVG paths to directly clip the slide images, with no need to show an intermediate layer.
Images: Unsplash
Creating the structure
The HTML structure is composed by an unordered list ( ul.cd-slider ), containing the slides, and two additional list elements ( ul.cd-slider-navigation and ol.cd-slider-controls ) for the slider navigations.
Each list item inside the ul.cd-slider is composed by an svg containing a <clipPath> element (used to change the clipping area of the slide image) and an <image> element (whose clip-path url attribute is the <clipPath> id).
<div class="cd-slider-wrapper"> <ul class="cd-slider" data-step1="M1402,800h-2V0.6c0-0.3,0-0.3,0-0.6h2v294V800z" data-step2="M1400,800H383L770.7,0.6c0.2-0.3,0.5-0.6,0.9-0.6H1400v294V800z" data-step3="M1400,800H0V0.6C0,0.4,0,0.3,0,0h1400v294V800z" data-step4="M-2,800h2L0,0.6C0,0.3,0,0.3,0,0l-2,0v294V800z" data-step5="M0,800h1017L629.3,0.6c-0.2-0.3-0.5-0.6-0.9-0.6L0,0l0,294L0,800z" data-step6="M0,800h1400V0.6c0-0.2,0-0.3,0-0.6L0,0l0,294L0,800z"> <li class="visible"> <div class="cd-svg-wrapper"> <svg viewBox="0 0 1400 800"> <title>Aimated SVG</title> <defs> <clipPath id="cd-image-1"> <path id="cd-changing-path-1" d="M1400,800H0V0.6C0,0.4,0,0.3,0,0h1400v294V800z"/> </clipPath> </defs> <image height='800px' width="1400px" clip-path="url(#cd-image-1)" xlink:href="img/img-1.jpg"></image> </svg> </div> <!-- .cd-svg-wrapper --> </li> <li> <div class="cd-svg-wrapper"> <svg viewBox="0 0 1400 800"> <!-- svg content here --> </svg> </div> <!-- .cd-svg-wrapper --> </li> <!-- other list items here --> </ul> <!-- .cd-slider --> <ul class="cd-slider-navigation"> <li><a href="#0" class="next-slide">Next</a></li> <li><a href="#0" class="prev-slide">Prev</a></li> </ul> <!-- .cd-slider-navigation --> <ol class="cd-slider-controls"> <li class="selected"><a href="#0"><em>Item 1</em></a></li> <li><a href="#0"><em>Item 2</em></a></li> <!-- other list items here --> </ol> <!-- .cd-slider-controls --> </div> <!-- .cd-slider-wrapper -->
Adding style
The slider structure is quite basic: all slides have an opacity: 0, are in absolute position and are placed one on top of the other (top: 0 and left:0). The .visible class is added to the selected slide (at the end of the clipping animation) to make it visible, while the .is-animating class is added to the list item during the clipping animation (z-index: 3 so that it is over the li.visible item).
Note: we had to use the Padding Hack to make the svg responsive (IE assumes svg height to be 150px if you don't explicitly define it). Basically, we set the div.cd-svg-wrapper height to 0 and its padding-bottom to 57.15% (to preserve svg proportion, in our case 800/1400), and set the svg height and width to 100%.
.cd-slider > li { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; opacity: 0; } .cd-slider > li.visible { position: relative; z-index: 2; opacity: 1; } .cd-slider > li.is-animating { z-index: 3; opacity: 1; } .cd-slider .cd-svg-wrapper { /* using padding Hack to fix bug on IE - svg height not properly calculated */ height: 0; padding-bottom: 57.15%; } .cd-slider svg { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }
Events handling
To animate the slide image clipping area, we animated the 'd' attribute of the <path> element inside the <clipPath> .
First of all, we had to define the different steps of our animation: we used the same process described in the Animated SVG Hero Slider article (Events handling section); but in this case, we needed only 6 steps (3 steps to animate from a slide to the next one and 3 more steps to animate from a slide to the previous one).
Once defined the paths, we added to the .cd-slider a data-stepn attribute (one for each step) equal to the 'd' attribute of the defined path (to easily retrieve it with JavaScript).
We then used the animate() method provided by Snap.svg to animate the path element.
clipPath.attr('d', path1).animate({'d': path2}, duration, firstCustomMinaAnimation, function(){ clipPath.animate({'d': path3}, duration, secondCustomMinaAnimation, function(){ oldSlide.removeClass('visible'); newSlide.addClass('visible').removeClass('is-animating'); }); });
Besides, we implemented a basic slider for the image gallery (with keyboard and touch swipe navigation, previous/next and dots navigation).
BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Riding on rave reviews and huge anticipation around the globe, Warner Bros. Pictures' and Village Roadshow Pictures' “Mad Max: Fury Road” thundered at the worldwide box office with an opening weekend of more than $109.4 million, making it the #1 new release at the global box office. It is also the biggest opening ever for director George Miller and is already the highest grossing of all the “Mad Max” films. The announcement was made today by Dan Fellman, President of Domestic Distribution, and Veronika Kwan Vandenberg, President of International Distribution, Warner Bros. Pictures.
George Miller's return to the world of “Mad Max” was a major draw overseas, where it earned an aggregate estimated $65 million in 68 territories on 16,900 screens. It was #1 at the box office in almost 40 territories, including Australia, the birthplace of the post-apocalyptic anti-hero, as well as such key markets as France, Russia, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Korea, all of Scandinavia, and many more.
On the domestic front, “Mad Max: Fury Road” had an excellent opening of more than $44.4 million at 3,702 locations.
In making the announcement, Fellman said, “George Miller, together with his extraordinary cast, led by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, and fellow filmmakers, has created a movie-going experience that critics agree is not to be missed, as evidenced by the 98% ‘Fresh' score on Rotten Tomatoes—resulting in the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated actioner so well-reviewed. Word of mouth is already tremendous and should drive box office returns well into summer.”
Kwan Vandenberg stated, “It's truly gratifying to see the fantastic critical reaction translate to such strong numbers at the box office. George Miller's edge-of-your-seat, action-packed experience is a must-see big-screen visual stunner that is luring both diehard followers and new fans around the world.”
Sue Kroll, President of Worldwide Marketing and International Distribution, said, “Anticipation began with our early campaign, which offered just a taste of the world inhabited by George Miller's unique characters. Triumphant premieres in Los Angeles and at the Cannes Film Festival further fueled the social media buzz surrounding ‘Fury Road,' which, combined with phenomenal reviews, turned the release into a global event.”
Greg Silverman, President, Creative Development and Worldwide Production, added, “The success of ‘Mad Max: Fury Road' is a testament to the commitment of George Miller and his team to deliver something moviegoers have never seen before. George's vision not only lives up to the legacy of his pioneering ‘Mad Max' films but expands upon that legacy for a new generation. We thank our partners at Village Roadshow and, together with them, congratulate everyone involved in the film.”
From director George Miller, originator of the post-apocalyptic genre and mastermind behind the legendary “Mad Max” franchise, comes “Mad Max: Fury Road,” a return to the world of the Road Warrior, Max Rockatansky.
Haunted by his turbulent past, Mad Max believes the best way to survive is to wander alone. Nevertheless, he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by Imperator Furiosa. They are escaping a Citadel tyrannized by the Immortan Joe, from whom something irreplaceable has been taken. Enraged, the Warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the high-octane Road War that follows.
Tom Hardy (“The Dark Knight Rises”) stars in the title role in “Mad Max: Fury Road”—the fourth in the franchise's history. Oscar winner Charlize Theron (“Monster,” “Prometheus”) stars as Imperator Furiosa. The film also stars Nicholas Hoult (“X-Men: Days of Future Past”) as Nux; Hugh Keays-Byrne (“Mad Max,” “Sleeping Beauty”) as Immortan Joe; Josh Helman (“X-Men: Days of Future Past”) as Slit; Nathan Jones (“Conan the Barbarian”) as Rictus Erectus; collectively known as The Wives, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (“Transformers: Dark of the Moon”) is The Splendid Angharad, Riley Keough (“Magic Mike”) is Capable, Zoë Kravitz (“Divergent”) plays Toast the Knowing, Abbey Lee is The Dag, and Courtney Eaton is Cheedo the Fragile. Also featured in the movie are John Howard, Richard Carter, singer/songwriter/performer iOTA, Angus Sampson, Jennifer Hagan, Megan Gale, Melissa Jaffer, Melita Jurisic, Gillian Jones and Joy Smithers.
Oscar-winning filmmaker George Miller (“Happy Feet”) directed the film from a screenplay he wrote with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. Miller also produced the film, along with longtime producing partner, Oscar nominee Doug Mitchell (“Babe”, “Happy Feet”), and PJ Voeten. Iain Smith, Chris deFaria, Courtenay Valenti, Graham Burke, Bruce Berman and Steven Mnuchin served as executive producers.
The behind-the-scenes creative team included Oscar-winning director of photography John Seale (“The English Patient”), production designer Colin Gibson (“Babe”), editor Margaret Sixel (“Happy Feet”), Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“A Room with a View”), second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris (“Australia”), and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt (“Knowing”).
Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Kennedy Miller Mitchell production, a George Miller film, “Mad Max: Fury Road.” The film is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures. This film has been rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout, and for disturbing images.

Here in Virginia, U.S.A., I'm aware that the native people were murdered, driven out, and moved westward. But my personal connection to that crime is weak, and frankly I'm too busy trying to rein in my government's current abuses to focus on the distant past. Pocahontas is a cartoon, the Redskins a football team, and remaining Native Americans almost invisible. Protests of the European occupation of Virginia are virtually unheard of.
But what if it had just happened a moment ago, historically speaking? What if my parents had been children or teenagers? What if my grandparents and their generation had conceived and executed the genocide? What if a large population of survivors and refugees were still here and just outside? What if they were protesting, nonviolently and violently — including with suicide bombings and homemade rockets launched out of West Virginia? What if they marked the Fourth of July as the Great Catastrophe and made it a day of mourning? What if they were organizing nations and institutions all over the world to boycott, divest, and sanction the United States and seek its prosecution in court? What if, before being driven out, the Native Americans had built hundreds of towns with buildings of masonry, hard to make simply disappear?
In that case, it would be more difficult for those unwilling to face the injustice not to notice. We would have to notice, but tell ourselves something comforting, if we refused to deal with the truth. The lies we tell ourselves would need to be much stronger than they are. A rich mythology would be necessary. Everyone would have to be taught from childhood onward that the native people didn't exist, left voluntarily, attempted vicious crimes justifying their punishment, and were not really people at all but irrational killers still trying to kill us for no reason. I'm aware that some of those excuses conflict with others, but propaganda generally works better with multiple claims, even when they can't all be true at the same time. Our government might even have to make questioning the official story of the creation of the United States an act of treason.
Israel is that imagined United States, just formed in our grandparents' day, two-thirds of the people driven out or killed, one-third remaining but treated as sub-human. Israel is that place that must tell forceful lies to erase a past that is never really past. Kids grow up in Israel not knowing. We in the United States, whose government gives Israel billions of dollars worth of free weapons every year with which to continue the killing (weapons with names like Apache and Black Hawk), grow up not knowing. We all look at the “peace process,” this endless charade of decades, and deem it inscrutable, because we've been educated to be incapable of knowing what the Palestinians want even as they shout it and sing it and chant it: they want to return to their homes.
But the people who did the deed are, in many cases, still alive. Men and women who, in 1948, massacred and evicted Palestinians from their villages can be put on camera recounting what they did. Photographs of what was done and accounts of what life was like before the Nakba (the Catastrophe) exist in great volume. Towns that were taken over still stand. Families know that they live in stolen houses. Palestinians still have keys to those houses. Villages that were destroyed still remain visible in outline on Google Earth, the trees still standing, the stones of demolished houses still nearby.
Lia Tarachansky is an Israeli-Canadian journalist who covers Israel and Palestine for the Real News Network. She was born in Kiev, Ukraine, the Soviet Union. When she was a child, her family moved to a settlement in the West Bank, part of the ongoing continuation of the process begun in 1948. She had a good childhood with a real sense of community in that “settlement,” or what we would call a housing subdivision built on native farm land in violation of a treaty made with savages. She grew up not knowing. People pretended nothing had been there before. Then she found out. Then she made a movie to tell the world.
The film is called On the Side of the Road and it tells the story of the founding of Israel in 1948 through the memories of those who killed and expelled the people of Palestine, through the memories of survivors, and through the perspectives of those who have grown up since. 1948 was a 1984 year, a year of doublespeak. Israel was created in blood. Two-thirds of the people of that land were made refugees. Most of them and their descendants are refugees still. Those who remained in Israel were made second-class citizens and forbidden to mourn the dead. But the crime is referred to as liberation and independence. Israel celebrates its Independence Day while Palestinians mourn the Nakba.
The film takes us to the sites of vanished villages destroyed in 1948 and in 1967. In some cases, villages have been replaced with woods and made into national parks. The imagery is suggestive of what the earth might do if humanity departed. But this is the work of part of humanity attempting to erase another human group. If you put up a sign commemorating the village, the government removes it quickly.
The film shows us those who participated in the Nakba. They recall shooting the people they called Arabs and whom they'd been told were primitive and worthless, but who they knew had a modern literate society with some 20 newspapers in Jaffa, with feminist groups, with everything then thought of as modern. “Go to Gaza!” they told the people whose homes and land they were stealing and destroying. One man recalling what he did begins with an attitude almost bordering on the carefree heartlessness one sees in former killers in the Indonesian film The Act of Killing, but eventually he's explaining that what he's done has been eating away at him for decades.
In On the Side of the Road we meet a young Palestinian man from a permanent refugee camp who calls a place his home although he's never been there, and who says that his children and grandchildren will do likewise. We see him obtain a 12-hour pass to visit the place his grandparents lived. He spends half the 12 hours getting through check points. The place he visits is a National Park. He sits and talks about what he wants. He wants nothing related to revenge. He wants no harm done to Jews. He wants no people evicted from anywhere. He says that, according to his grandparents, Jews and Muslims lived together amicably before 1948. That, he says, is what he wants — that and to return home.
Israelis concerned by their nation's open secret take some inspiration in the film from an art project in Berlin. There people posted signs with images on one side and words on the other. For example: a cat on one side, and this on the other: “Jews are no longer allowed to own pets.” So, in Israel, they made signs of a similar nature. For example: a man with a key on one side, and on the other, in German: “It is forbidden to mourn on the Day of Independence.” The signs are greeted by vandalism and angry, racist threats. The police accuse those who posted the signs of “disturbing law and order,” and forbid them in the future.
At Tel Aviv University we see students, Palestinian and Jewish, hold an event to read out the names of villages that were destroyed. Nationalists waving flags come to try to shout them down. These properly educated Israelis describe cities as having been “liberated.” They advocate expelling all Arabs. A member of the Israeli parliament tells the camera that Arabs want to exterminate Jews and rape their daughters, that the Arabs threaten a “holocaust.”
The filmmaker asks an angry Israeli woman, “If you were an Arab, would you celebrate the state of Israel?” She refuses to allow the possibility of seeing things from someone else's point of view to enter her head. She replies, “I'm not an Arab, thank God!”
A Palestinian challenges a nationalist very politely and civilly, asking him to explain his views, and he swiftly walks away. I was reminded of a talk I gave last month at a university in New York at which I criticized the Israeli government, and a professor angrily walked out — a professor who'd been eager to debate other topics on which we disagreed.
A woman who participated in the Nakba says in the film, in an effort to excuse her past actions, “We didn't know it was a society.” She clearly believes that killing and evicting people who seem “modern” or “civilized” is unacceptable. Then she goes on to explain that pre-1948 Palestine was just what she says mustn't be destroyed. “But you lived here,” says the filmmaker. “How could you not know?” The woman replies simply, “We knew. We knew.”
A man who took part in killing Palestinians in 1948 excuses himself as having been only 19. And “there will always be new 19-year-olds,” he says. Of course there are also 50-year-olds who will follow evil orders. Happily, there are also 19-year-olds who will not.

OGDEN — A 13-year-old girl was accidentally shot in the neck by her 11-year-old sister Sunday after the girls found a gun in their grandparents' bedroom while cleaning.
The girl, however, did not suffer any life threatening injuries. Ogden Police Lt. Jake Sube said she was very lucky.
"It absolutely could have been very tragic," he said.
The incident happened just after 3 p.m. while the girls were at their grandparents' home in the 100 North block of Pingree Ave.
"It appears that the two girls were alone cleaning the grandparents' bedroom when the gun was found. Moments after finding the gun, the 11-year-old accidentally discharged the firearm striking the 13-year-old in the neck," he said.
Sube did not know Sunday where in the bedroom the gun was found. The older girl actually told her sister to be careful after she found the weapon because it might be loaded, he said.
"About the same moment it was fired," Sube said.
The weapon used was described as an older model .22-caliber revolver, Sube said. Police believe the elderly grandparents had not used the gun for many years and likely forgot it was in the bedroom.
"It had been out of sight, out of mind for a long time," Sube said.
He said the bullet broke her skin but did not penetrate any vital organs. He said a lump in her skin where the bullet came to rest could be seen.
"When police first made contact with the victim, she was conscious and alert but obviously shaken up. She was taken to a local hospital in good spirits and will likely have surgery to remove the bullet," Sube said. "She had a very positive attitude."
No arrests were made or citations issued Sunday. The investigation would continue, he said.
"The family involved has avoided a tragedy today and we are very thankful. This could have been much worse," said Sube who also said the incident was a good reminder for all gun owners to keep their weapons secured in their homes, even if they don't have children of their own.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Stephanie Lopez is on leave from both the Albuquerque Police Department and her position as president of the Police Officers Association after her arrest on felony child abuse charges Thursday evening.
Toni Balzano, a spokeswoman for the police union, said the union's board members will meet next month to decide the future of Lopez's position. Meanwhile, Shaun Willoughby, vice president of the police union, is the acting president, according to a statement from the union.
Lopez, who became the union president in May 2013, was taken into custody after, investigators said, she repeatedly struck her 14-year-old daughter in the face, causing significant bruising.

She also pulled the girl's hair and threw her to the ground after the girl failed to tell Lopez about a utility shutoff notice posted on the family's door, according to a criminal complaint written by a Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office detective.
She was charged with child abuse without causing great bodily harm, and bribery and intimidation of a witness.
She allegedly warned the girl not to say anything when she dropped her off at school on Wednesday morning, the day after the incident, according to the complaint.
Lopez, 40, was released from jail after a woman named Rebecca Lopez posted $5,000 cash bail on Stephanie Lopez's behalf. Lopez is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges at 10 a.m. today in Metropolitan Court, according to court records.
Lopez could not be reached for comment Friday.
Willoughby said in a prepared statement: “Allegations of child abuse are obviously a very serious matter, and of course we understand the importance of thoroughly investigating any claims made by a child. With that being said, I have only known Stephanie Lopez to be a loving single working mom who was doing her best to raise bright, caring and well-behaved children.

“We trust in the judicial process to resolve this matter for her and her family,” he said.
Lopez's conditions of release include not possessing firearms or having contact with the victim, according to court records.
Officer Tanner Tixier, a spokesman for the Albuquerque Police Department, said that Lopez was placed on paid administrative leave on Friday. That means her badge and gun were taken away, he said.
Lopez, who has been with the department since July 2000, has been the subject of controversy before.
She received a letter of caution from the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy Board in July 2014 for mixing her role as a police officer with that of union president.
She responded to a domestic violence call involving a fellow officer and was accused of putting her personal feelings into a police report on the matter, according to board documents. The police gave her a suspension in that case.
Lopez also was disciplined for an April 2011 case in which a KOB-TV reporter filmed an altercation between Lopez and a person at a nightclub. Police confiscated the camera and deleted some of the footage, according to Journal archives.
Police didn't release her entire internal affairs file on Friday, or say whether she had been given other suspensions.
But government critics and members of the group saw the closing as a sign that the Jordanian government felt confident that it could join Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in cracking down on the Brotherhood, which has long operated legally in Jordan and was considered the largest opposition party.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan has been thrown into internal turmoil in recent years, with a rift developing between older, more moderate members who want to calm tensions and more hawkish members who want to challenge the government on political reforms, rights and other issues.
In February, 400 members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, including some of the group's founders and top leaders, resigned in protest against the group's continuing affiliations with the regional Muslim Brotherhood, based in Cairo, which they see as increasingly militant and marginalized.

The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan subsequently decided to cut ties to the regional movement, hoping to lure back some of those who had left. Many of them had already joined the Muslim Brotherhood Society, however, and many said it was too late to go back.
The former deputy party leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, Nimer Assaf, said by telephone that the closing of the headquarters was “a dangerous step, because this group was against terrorism and had been part of this country for a long time, and such actions drive people to extremism.”
Stamp Collecting Values
Quickly determining stamp collecting values, or finding out how much a stamp collection or single postage stamp is worth, should be easy.
Why does it take years to become an expert in the field of stamp collecting? 1. Identifying stamps is complex requiring extensive research, knowledge, and experience 2. There is an overwhelming amount of information to learn but that info isn't easy to find or use 3. Value is extremely dependent on condition and many stamps have been intentionally altered to "look" better and these take experience to identify
The good news is you can pretty quickly get a general idea of stamp collecting values by following a few rules of thumb. The bad news is these rules help identify what is likely not valuable so more research and effort will likely be required to get an accurate valuation.
Figuring out how to appropriately adjust prices on individual rare stamps is based on centering and condition. There are many subjective variables but, again, there are a few general guidelines that will steer you in the right direction for the vast majority of collections. It doesn't take decades of stamp collecting to understand how the stamp market works.
There are some great online resources to get comparative prices. Check ebay and look for the same stamps of the same condition and same centering. I can't stress how important it is to find examples as close as possible to what you have because even sligth condition differences can mean dramatic price differences - a $100 stamp with a tear is probably not worth $10.
Always remember to reduce that ebay price by about 20% to account for the ebay and paypal fees - a lesson many learn they hard way when they get far less than expected after all the fees.
But that shouldn't dissuade you from checking for similar listed stamps - being armed with multiple pricing sources of information will help you better estimate the value.
In addition to price comparisons of 'like' stamps online, check out the industry-standard price guides. In the United States that is the Scott Postage Stamp Catalog. There are many other catalogs of note throughout the world, such as the appropriately named Stanley Gibbons Commonwealth and British Empire Stamps Catalog.
In the US, most public libraries have a set of Scott catalogs but, depending on when it was printed, the prices may be quite different than current prices. There are cyclical price fluctuations in the stamp market just like any other asset market so you can find catalogs with out of whack prices, both higher and lower, from current valuations.
One example showing the importance of using current prices is the stamp asset bubble that burst in the early 1980s. Rather than the massive price increases you would expect over three decades, some of the rarest and most popular stamps have actually gone down in value over the past 30 years.
The United States 1930 release of the Graf Zeppelins (Scott #C13 - C15) is a notorious example. This popular and scarce set of stamps was more valuable in 1980 than it is today.
Back to the catalog - the best thing you can do is spend 15 minutes reading the introductory material in the front of the catalog where the pricing method and prices are described in detail.
Once comfortable, start flipping through checking for the stamps you have. Use the catalogs as a general tool and it won't steer you wrong.
But don't zero in on any one stamp as having a huge postage stamp value - I've lost track of the times I've found a stamp worth hundreds of dollars only to realize I had the "common" version and was mistaking it for the "rare" version.
For example, one of the mostly widely used stamps of its time, the 1861 issue of a 1 cent Franklin was produced in estimated quantities of 150,000,000!
Such huge quantites mean that even today it is a common stamp and most examples are worth a few dollars. Most US Stamps collections contain one or more of these stamps, shown at left.
However, this same stamp was issued in a slightly different format with a Z-grill impression on the back of the stamp (Scott #85A). Only 2 examples of that rarest of US stamps are known to have survived and it is valued at $3,000,000.
Quite a difference for two stamps that have the identical design and can only be told apart by an expert adept at identifying and expertizing the generally faint and incomplete grill impressions.
I've been holding off on the bad news but here it is – most stamps and stamp collections are worth little to nothing. That being said, there are rare stamps out there worth millions just waiting to be found so let's get started!
General rules that are usually, but not always, true for stamp collecting values.
• Mint stamps with original gum on the back are worth more than used stamps
•Earlier stamps are worth more than modern stamps
•Stamps with any faults (creases, tears, thins, etc.) are worth far less than those in perfect condition. One thing that is common with most collectibles, especially stamps, is that condition is everything. The same stamp that normally sells for $100 may not even be worth $10 if there are creases, thins, tears, etc.
•Boxes of loose used stamps are usually worth very little
•Stamp albums that are sparsely filled are usually worth very little
•Stamp albums for children or beginners are usually worth very little
•Used US postage stamps printed in the last 70 years are worth almost nothing
• Mint with original gum US postage stamps printed in the last 70 years are, with a few exceptions, worth less than their face value and can be used for postage without worry. I use old stamps back into the 1930s as postage to mail envelopes. Old stamps are still valid for postage...well, all stamps issued after the civil war at least :)
Often the best you can do with postage is to use it for mail. Unfortunately, many collections have so many modern mint stamps that there is no chance to actually use them all even in a few lifetimes! This is why people routinely sell stamps at far below face value (many stamp dealers offer 50-70% depending on their customer base, how much postage they already have in inventory, and what denominations are included). They will then either use it for postage or resell it at 75-90% of the face value to buyers that use it on mailings.
The stamp collecting boom of the 1930's resulted in countless thousands of collectors hoarding newly issued stamps the US Postal Service issued. This kicked off a positive feedback loop that prompted the USPS to design and print more stamps to meet the increased demand.
The net effect is that virtually all US stamps produced since the 1930s are available in quantities that far exceed collector demand so stamp collecting values have suffered.
With mail use going down, stamp collecting values have also suffered. Sadly, for many stamp collectors that means that their stamp nest egg is worth only a fraction of what was originally paid.
Stamp collecting values also depend on the type of collection.
- Is it a collection of stamps on envelopes - Either first day covers, postal history, or otherwise?
- Are there boxes of loose stamps?
- Are there stamp collecting albums?
- Are there books? Stamp catalogs, philatelic literature, etc?
- Are there boxes of ‘other stuff' that probably looks like a mix of stamps in small envelopes and glassines, stamps in dealer stock cards or pages, and a wide variety of stamps in different mounts and formats?
For collections with better and rare stamps it won't be enough to figure stamp collecting values in general. You'll need to selectively check some individual stamps to get a general sense of quality of the collection. This can have dramatic implications as a small collection of perfect stamps can be worth many, many times that of the same stamps in poor condition. You don't know which quality of collection you have until you check the stamps.
At the single stamp level, there are many factors that can dramatically affect stamp collecting values but, for the most part, it all comes down to supply and demand. Many stamps are rare but not valuable because there is not enough demand to drive the price up. But find a rare and high demand stamp and watch out. A handful of the crown jewels of philately have sold over the past few decades for multi-million dollar sums.
And there are further supply and demand factors at work affecting ranges of stamp collecting values for unique copies of the same stamp. For example, classic US stamps have a high demand from the stamp investors for perfectly centered and completely faultless stamps which drives stamp collecting values up exponentially.
The price of a ‘perfect' stamp can be hundreds of times the price for the exact same stamp that is slightly off center or has some minor condition problem (e.g. a small crease that you can't even see without a magnifying glass).
Share. You got your MOBA in my shooter. You got your MOBA in my shooter.
Every year, the studio developing Call of Duty tries something new to shake up the familiar formula.
Sledgehammer Games, for example, wanted more speed and verticality, so Advanced Warfare had jetpack-like Exo suits. Treyarch's plan for Black Ops 3 doesn't sound as revolutionary, and until you play the game, it might not make any sense.
“ They're taking the shootiest shooter around, and... adding more shooting.
They're taking the shootiest shooter around, and… adding more shooting. That's not cynicism; it's genuine astonishment.
When I visited Treyarch to see Black Ops 3 in action, the developers kept using the phrase “guns up.” Boiled down, it means no matter what you're doing, you're going to have full control of your weapon.
“Guns up” goes hand-in-hand with the game's expanded movement mechanics, like wall running and reverse powersliding. In Black Ops 3, you spend a lot of time not on the ground. If you couldn't effectively control your weapon during all those crazy maneuvers, you'd probably keep your boots on the dirt, which would render many of the game's more fun mechanics pointless. Thus, guns up!
Exit Theatre Mode
Because Black Ops 3 is set in 2060 (only a few years after Advanced Warfare), I don't think “new coat of paint” is the right phrase here. Instead, seeing as it's now possible to zip around like a slippery gerbil, “new coat of grease” is more fitting. Nowhere is that more evident than in multiplayer, so that's where I'll start.
And dont' worry, campaign and zombies details are on the way too.
Multiplayer
Let's get the biggest question out of the way first. Does Black Ops 3 have Exo suits?
“ Does Black Ops 3 have Exo suits? No, it does not.
No, it does not.
However, we're not going back to Call of Duty: Ghosts either. There is a thruster pack on every character, but it feels different from what I played last year.
I know this might sound weird, but it helps me to think about it mathematically. Movements in Advanced Warfare's Exo suits are very sharp and aggressive. If you start at point A, boost to point B, then boost to point C, that entire path would probably look like a sharp angle.
In Black Ops 3, you can boost to points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G in the same amount of time, and the result would look more like a curve. You have subtle control now. You can tap the boost button repeatedly to course-correct, for example, or turn toward an hole in a blasted-out wall.

Black Ops 3 is about chaining movements. The following scenario is entirely possible: you can sprint, vault over cover, jump onto a wall, run along it, kill someone while wall running, notice an enemy on your radar, jump off, boost into the air, spin around, land on the ground, initiate a reverse powerslide, and kill the player who was running behind you.
The next big point is one that makes the MOBA player in me very, very happy. You no longer play as generic soldiers. Before a match begins, you pick a unique character, each with his, her, or its own unique power and weapon. You can only pick one though (the power or the weapon), and each is treated like a miniature score streak.
Though Treyarch is still tweaking things, when I played, I felt like I unlocked my weapon or power about as often as I unlocked a UAV.
“ You no longer play as generic soldiers.
Four Specialists have been revealed so far, with at least another five on the way.
Ruin's weapons are Gravity Spikes, which allow him to leap through the air and slam down on his target with an area-of-effect shockwave. His power, Overdrive, greatly accelerates all movement for a short time.
Seraph's (my personal favorite) weapon is the Annihilator, a huge, high-caliber revolver that kills enemies in one shot and has penetration rounds. If you can line up two enemies, you'll take them both out. Her ability is Combat Focus, which triggers a bonus multiplier to score steak points.
Outrider's weapon is the Sparrow, a compound bow with explosive bolts. Her ability is Vision Pulse, which expands out from the player, tagging all enemies' locations and allowing you to see them through walls.
Reaper is a killer robot. His weapon is the scythe, a minigun that emerges from his arm. His ability, Glitch, allows him to flash back to wherever he was a few seconds ago.
Specialist aren't tied to loadouts, so you can't change them in the middle of a match. Pick wisely.
Campaign
Black Ops 3 is set in 2060. 35 years after the drone strikes in Black Ops 2, the world's leaders have developed DEAD (Directed Energy Air Defense) systems, which make air superiority useless. Military strength shifts back to “boots on the ground.”
DNI (Direct Neural Interface) technology gives soldiers complete control over their physiology. It also allows them to integrate with computer systems, including enhanced cybernetic limbs. For a squad of Black Ops soldiers, DNI allows them to communicate and coordinate faster than ever before.
At the beginning of the game, a Black Ops team is sent to a CIA site in Singapore. For the first time ever, contact with them is lost. What follows is the largest leak of military intelligence in history. This is where the campaign begins.
Exit Theatre Mode
While I wasn't told much else, I did get a good look at a few big changes. New powers, called “Cyber Cores,” can be customized by the player and used in any level. Rather than having cool abilities that can only be used at certain times, you can now use the powers you want, when you want.
A few examples are “immolation,” which allows you to set a target on fire with a flick of the wrist. Another is “remote hijack,” which lets you take command of vehicles and robots (like drones) and use them against their allies.
Treyarch wanted the four-player online co-op experience to feel great, not tacked on. So the campaign levels are built more openly to accommodate a larger number of players and allow different tactics. If you're playing alone, however, Treyarch says you shouldn't be overwhelmed because open areas are built with multiple smaller “routes” in mind that feel more precise and focused.
Aside from more guns, another benefit to playing four-player co-op is T-mode. If one player can see an enemy, that enemy is tagged for allies, regardless of whether they have vision or not. It encourages you to seek high ground and split up to cover more area.
Zombies
Treyarch stayed tight-lipped about Zombies, though they did say it's going to be bigger than it's ever been. Zombies in Black Ops 3 will have its own storyline and a full XP-based progression system.
Aside from those details, I saw an image of a zombie holding a card decorated with weird symbols and imagery. At the top of the poster was the phrase “Only the cursed survive.” Mysterious.
Black Ops 3 doesn't feel as different from Advanced Warfare as Advanced Warfare did from Ghosts. That's not a bad thing at all; it just seems like Call of Duty developers are entering a refinement period like the one we saw after the original Modern Warfare.
Players who pre-order Black Ops 3 will have access to a multiplayer beta on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. No beta date has been announced yet, but when it's released, try out the fast-paced Black Ops 3 for yourself and let us know what you think of the new mechanics. And, as always, for more on Call of Duty, stay with IGN.

International tensions spilled into competition on Friday when an Egyptian judoka refused to shake his Israeli competitor's hand following their bout at the Rio Olympics.
Or Sasson stepped forward to shake Islam El Shehaby's hand after defeating the Egyptian fighter, but El Shehaby shook his head and backed away.
Judo fighters typically bow and shake hands before and after a bout. El Shahaby was called back to bow by the referee and gave a nod of his head.
El Shahaby was booed loudly by the Rio crowd.
The 32-year-old had reportedly faced pressure from some Islamist and nationalist Egyptians to withdraw from the match.
“My son watch out, don't be fooled, or fool yourself thinking you will play with the Israeli athlete to defeat him and make Egypt happy,” Mataz Matar, a television host in the Al-Sharq Islamist-leaning network, said on Thursday,
according to the Associated Press. “Egypt will cry; Egypt will be sad and you will be seen as a traitor and a normalizer in the eyes of your people.”
International Judo Federation spokesman Nicolas Messner said there is “no obligation” to shake hands after a fight, “but it is compulsory to bow, that's why the Egyptian was called back to bow and he did.”
Messner said it is “already a big improvement that Arabic countries accept to (fight) Israel,” and that El Shehaby's “attitude will be reviewed after the Games to see if any further action should be taken.”
After draining 14 of 18 three-pointers in the first half, the Rockets appeared well on pace to break some records against the Warriors. And indeed, in blowing out Golden State 140-109, Houston blasted right through the franchise high for three-pointers (17) and set the record for points scored at the Toyota Center with 140. With 3:41 remaining and garbage time in full effect, Donatas Motiejunas drained Houston's 23rd three, tying the all-time NBA record.
Houston had plenty of time to make history, but Mark Jackson's Warriors would have none of it. First they watched the Rockets -- clearly gunning for the record -- miss a couple of eager heaves while the crowd rained down chants of "ONE MORE THREE!"
When Patrick Beverley drove the lane, threw down a big dunk, and celebrated a little too demonstratively for a guy whose team was up 30, the Warriors finally snapped. First Draymond Green got ejected for a hard hit on Beverley, then Jackson engaged a troll job for the ages.
On Houston's last few possessions, the Warriors assured there would be no more threes. Jackson knew full well the Rockets were hunting for the record, so he had his guys commit intentional fouls to prevent Rockets from even attempting to break the record. It worked. Houston couldn't even pull a three-pointer in the final 1:58 and finished the game with 23 threes, tying the mark set by the Orlando Magic in 2009.
Well trolled, Coach Jackson. Good to see you've still got some pride down 30-plus points.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an emergency meeting of his high-level security cabinet Thursday morning as top officials mulled how to respond to a unity bid between the militant Palestinian Hamas group and the more moderate Fatah movement.
Israeli officials have slammed the pact as proof that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is uninterested in reaching a peace accord with Israel, while Palestinians have defended the deal as bringing a two-state solution closer.
Israeli radio said ministers were likely to announce fresh retaliatory measures on top of a raft of financial sanctions unveiled this month when the Palestinians applied to join 15 international treaties.

They were not expected to order a complete halt to US-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians, however.
Netanyahu's office described the deal between Abbas and Hamas, which opposes all peace talks with Israel, as “very grave.”
But it said it was for ministers to decide whether to announce any new measures after Thursday's meeting.
“By tying itself to Hamas, the Palestinian leadership is turning its back on peace,” a Netanyahu aide said.
On Wednesday, Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is dominated by Abbas's Fatah movement, agreed to form a unity government and call for new elections across the West Bank and Gaza. The move would bring the terror group Hamas into the Palestinian Authority fold and make it party to negotiations with Israel.
Netanyahu lambasted the decision and phoned US Secretary of State John Kerry Wednesday night to denounce the move, which he said showed the “Palestinians were running away” from making decisions, according to a senior Israeli official, referring to efforts to extend peace talks with Israel past their April 29 deadline.
“Abbas has chosen Hamas and not peace. Whoever chooses Hamas does not want peace,” Netanyahu said in a statement.
Israel also canceled a round of peace talks scheduled for Wednesday night.
However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told AFP there was no meeting scheduled and Ramallah would hold a bilateral meeting with US meditor Martin Indyk on Thursday.
Hamas is labeled by the US and Israel as a terror organization and has refused to recognize Israel or renounce violence. The group has been bitterly opposed to peace efforts.
The US State Department expressed “disappointment” with the Palestinian move Wednesday.
The security cabinet comprises nine top ministers, including Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman, Finance Minister Yair Lapid, Economy Minister Naftali Bennett and and the chief peace negotiator, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, all of whom have castigated the unity deal.
“The reconciliation agreement that Mahmoud Abbas signed with Hamas is a bad step, which not only caused the cancellation of the meeting, but cast a heavy shadow on the possibility to progress,” Livni said Wednesday night.
Bennett, from the Hawkish Jewish Home faction, took the harshest line, saying the reconciliation made the PA into the “world's largest terror organization.”
Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said that Abbas's earlier threats to dissolve the PA and hand responsibility for the West Bank back to Israel was “illogical,” but maintained that the Fatah-Hamas unity deal was even worse.
“Hamas is not a government,” he said. “It is a jihadist terror organization that has inscribed on its flag the killing of civilians — women, children, old people — just because they are Jewish.”
As reports of the deal leaked out early Wednesday, Liberman said the pact would sink peace talks. “The signing of an agreement for a unity government between Fatah and Hamas is a signature on the end of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.”
Responding to Israeli anger, Abbas denied that reconciliation with Hamas precluded peace efforts.
“There is no incompatibility between reconciliation and the talks, especially since we are committed to a just peace on the basis of a two-state solution in accordance with the resolutions of international law,” Abbas said in a statement issued by his office.
“This move, supported by the Arab world and internationally, will strengthen the ability of the Palestinian negotiators to realize the two-state solution,” the statement read.
Jibril Rajoub, deputy director of the Fatah Central Committee, told The Times of Israel that the decision of the two Palestinian groups to form a unity government was an internal national matter, adding that “no party that believes in the solution of two states for two peoples has the right to deny it.”
Hamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since 2007, when Hamas violently took over the Gaza Strip, leaving Fatah to rule the West Bank. Previous efforts at reconciliation have failed.
Thugs who carry acid on the streets will face up to four years in prison under a new crackdown announced today by prosecutors.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it would in future seek to charge offenders caught with a corrosive substance with possession of an offensive weapon. The crime carries a potential four year jail term.
Prosecutors will be told to bring even tougher charges – carrying a maximum life sentence – against those who throw acid, even if no harm is caused to the intended victim.
It said the move was a response to public concern about a spate of horrific attacks and a recognition of the life-changing consequences that can be inflicted by acid and similar substances.
The announcement came as details were released of the most recent acid conviction in which a burglar admitted inflicting 24 per cent burns on a 69-year-old woman by spraying corrosive liquid on her after breaking into her home in Ilford.
The man also threatened a 90-year-old woman with acid during another break-in and used corrosive substances in other attacks. He will be sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court next month.
Unveiling the new crackdown today, Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was updating her guidance to prosecutors to ensure that the courts had the “widest possible sentencing power” to deal with acid offenders.
Burglar sprayed pensioner in terrifying attack A burglar who left a female pensioner with 24 per cent burns after spraying her with acid during a break-in has been convicted at a London court. Gerard Whelan, 45, from Paddington, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent after squeezing acid from a bottle onto the 69-year-old woman during a night-time burglary at her home in Ilford in July last year. She had to have skin grafts and other surgery and has been left with permanent scars to her arms, legs and face. The substance used to inflict her injuries had the same strength as sulphuric acid. Whelan was also convicted of a series of other offences involving acid. One was another burglary in December during which he threatened a 90-year-old with a screwdriver and sprayed acid on a wall before demanding money.He also caused serious injuries by squeezing acid onto another woman during a break-in in Ilford the day before. He had previously woken her up and threatened her by holding a screwdriver over her as she lay in her bed saying: “If you don't be quiet I will kill you.” He took a bangle and rings from her hand and arm and used acid on her when she tried to escape. Five other people, three men and two women, were also attacked with acid during separate robberies carried out by Whelan. He also carried out other assaults using a screwdriver during his crime spree. He will be sentenced in September at Wood Green Crown Court.
Another aim was to deter those who carried acid instead of a knife or other weapon in the mistaken belief that they could escape criminal sanctions.
“The point is that if you can't just expect to carry acid around without an excuse. It counts as an offensive weapon just as much as a knife or a screwdriver could be,” Ms Saunders told the Evening Standard.
“We are very conscious of the impact of this crime and how there has been a recent spate of it so we are very keen to make sure that we do prosecute it and the court has the right sentencing powers.
“We are recognising that there's been an increase in this type of crime, we are recognising the serious nature of it, the impact it can have on individuals who suffer from having corrosive fluids or acid sprayed at them, which can be life-changing.
“It's about making sure that we are prosecuting in a way that makes it clear there is a deterrent. It's not just about when you have sprayed, it's about having it with you because if you are carrying acid around we will look to prosecute you for carrying an offensive weapon.
"The maximum sentence for that is four years.”
Ms Saunders said that other charges that would be brought included inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. It applies when serious injury is caused and carries a potential life term.
Offenders who miss their target or fail to inflict injury because the victim is protecting themselves will risk an alternative charge of throwing acid or a similar corrosive substance with “intent to maim, disfigure or disable” a person. It too carries a maximum life sentence.
Other offences that today's new guidance urges prosecutors to consider include the crimes of possession of an offensive weapon on school premises and threatening with an offensive weapon in a school or public place. All carry up to four years in prison.
Ms Saunders added: “The guidance is to make clear that it's serious stuff. So on the public interest side we are very clear that so long as you have got the evidence you should be prosecuting these crimes.
“We are giving the courts the widest possible sentencing power they could possibly want which is up to life.”
Today's guidance emphasises that there are “a number of compelling public interest factors in favour of prosecution” when people are caught carrying or using acid in attacks.
They include the fact that the “the offence is widespread in the area where it was committed” and that a “culture of carrying weapons encourages violence” that “may lead to more serious criminal behaviour”.
Another factor in favour of charging is that prosecution will have a “positive impact” on community confidence.
The guidance also describes how acid and corrosive substances can be used “in connection with hate crime, so-called honour based violence, domestic abuse, and by gangs in retribution.”
It adds: “Acid and corrosive substance attacks have a devastating effect on victims and when thrown on to the victim's body – usually their face – cause the skin and flesh to melt, sometimes exposing and dissolving the bones below.
“The long-term consequences .. may include blindness, permanent scarring of the face and body, and social and psychological difficulties.
“Acid and other corrosive substances are becoming a preferred weapon of offenders carrying out criminal activity, due to it being easy to obtain, cheap and difficult to trace back to the perpetrator.”
Ms Saunders said that people such as cleaners who might have a genuine reason to possess acid would not be prosecuted if they could prove that they were carrying the substance for a legitimate purpose.
The CPS currently has 14 acid prosecutions for offences in London underway after a spate of muggings, revenge and hate attacks carried out with corrosive substances.
Official figures have revealed that more than 400 acid or corrosive substance attacks were carried out in the six months up to April 2017 across England and Wales.
Bleach, ammonia and acid were the most commonly used substances. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has responded by promising stricter rules on acid sales and a review of law enforcement measures that can be taken against the problem.
For generations now, April 20 has been known as an unofficial “stoner” holiday — a day of indulgence, extravagance, and excess. Local news stations were likely to cover the celebration with shots of of tie-die–clad revelers or college campuses cloudy with cannabis smoke. But as marijuana becomes more mainstream, 4/20 is evolving. It's not just for stoners anymore.
“What's happening right now is we're welcoming all these people to the cannabis community who've been afraid,” said Jessa Lewis, the marketing and brand director for Washington-based Nectar Craft. Older Americans are returning to cannabis after decades away, more and more women identify as consumers, and adults who never thought they'd try “dope” are increasingly canna-curious.
A decade ago it was hard for media to mention cannabis without making a Cheetos joke. Now publications hail 2016 as the “year of the upscale cannabis consumer.” The times are changing — and fast.
What does that mean for 4/20? Dispensaries and retail shops risk alienating some of the newest members to the cannabis community when they fall back on tired stereotypes, Lewis said. Garish graphics and hyper-potent products (not to mention blowtorches) no doubt appeal to a subset of customers, but they can be intimidating to casual consumers.
That doesn't mean business owners should scrap their 4/20 deals on dab rigs — experienced consumers are certainly looking to celebrate — but this year more than any, there's a lot to gain by being welcoming. Seasoned consumers may want deals on dabs, but newcomers might get more from education; think in-store classes on how to roll a joint or clean a bong. And don't forget to warn rookies to start low and go slow when it comes to edibles.
Concentrates might be the hot thing with committed consumers, but dispensaries should also consider products that resonate with newer clientele, such as pre-rolls, vape pens, or edibles. Leafly also recently published a list of strains that resonate particularly well with women — a growing group of cannabis consumers.
While 4/20 used to unite a marginalized group — those daring enough to admit to using cannabis — these days it's a big-tent affair. Some in the industry, Lewis said, have even thought about reframing the holiday as something broader, such as “Legalization Day.”
“Ask yourself a question: What kind of store do you want to be, and what kind of clientele do you want to serve?” she said. While she's not advocating a break from the 4/20 tradition, she encouraged business owners to approach the holiday the same way the industry has changed its strategy on cannabis itself: “Package it so everyone can enjoy it.”

For other people named James Kelly, see James Kelly (disambiguation)
Not to be confused with Joseph Kelly (crimper)
James Kelly, better known as "Shanghai" Kelly, was an American crimp of the 19th century who kidnapped men and forced them to work on ships. The terms "crimping" and "shanghaiing" are used to describe this type of work. Kelly wore a red beard and had a fiery temper to match. A legendary figure in San Francisco history, Kelly was known for his gift of supplying or shanghaiing men to understaffed ships.
Kelly kept a boarding house in San Francisco, variously reported to be on Pacific or Broadway.[1] He also ran a number of bars including the Boston House, at the corner of Davis and Chambers streets near the waterfront.[1] He also ran a saloon and boarding house at No. 33 Pacific between Drumm and Davis streets.[1] These businesses provided Kelly with a steady supply of victims.
In the early 1870s, Kelly was reported to have shanghaied 100 men for three understaffed ships in a single evening. Renting the paddle steamer Goliath, he announced that he was hosting a free booze cruise to celebrate his "birthday", and to say "thank you" to his fellow crimps and runners who had helped him through the years. After leaving port, his bartenders served opium-laced whiskey to his guests, who were then offloaded to the waiting ships.[2][3] His greatest concern – returning from a well-publicized event with a boat devoid of revelers – was alleviated by a stroke of luck, when he learned that the Yankee Blade had struck a rock and was sinking. After rescuing everyone on board, he simply resumed the celebration, and those on the waterfront were none the wiser upon his return.[2]
Actor Robert Taylor played Kelly in the 1967 episode "Shanghai Kelly's Birthday Party" of the syndicated television series Death Valley Days, which Taylor also hosted.[4]

On Monday, MSNBC host Chuck Todd derided President Donald Trump's attacks on the media and suggested they were more dangerous than normal media criticism.
“Let's call this what it is: the president and the White House is waging a war on the media,” Todd said during his show, “Meet the Press Daily.” His show played several clips of Trump attacking the media. These attacks, Todd suggested, showed a president moving toward “authoritarianism.”
“Folks, if these actions and this language was being used by a leader in a different country, our State Department — not just we in general — our State Department would be saying: ‘Hmm, that country is inching towards authoritarianism,'” Todd said.
He argued that typically, the first sign of authoritarianism is a leader delegitimizing the free press, as Trump did.
NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—As the curtain comes down on the Michael Bloomberg era, the three-term mayor of New York received fulsome praise last night from his most appreciative constituency: the people who can still afford to live there.
Harland Dorrinson, principal owner of the hedge fund Garrote Capital, hosted a black-tie dinner in the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to pay tribute to a mayor who, in Mr. Dorrinson's words, “put living in New York out of the reach of everyone except the deserving few.”
“To a lot of people, Mike Bloomberg will be remembered for reducing smoking and improving people's diets,” said Mr. Dorrinson. “But that shouldn't overshadow his greatest accomplishment, creating unaffordable housing throughout New York.”
“When Mike took office, this city was teeming with regular working people,” Mr. Dorrinson said, shuddering at the memory. “Today, it's a magnificent tapestry of investment bankers, real-estate developers, and Russian oligarchs.”
The hedge-fund owner is such a fan of Mr. Bloomberg's, in fact, that he has only one bone to pick with him: that he left office too soon “to finish the job.”
“There are still a few pockets in the city where, regrettably, the middle class seems to be hanging on,” he said. “The rent is too damn low.”
As for Mr. Bloomberg's critics, Mr. Dorrinson was philosophical: “I know there are some people who think Mike was terrible for New York, that he took a city rich with diversity and ruined it. But fortunately, they all live somewhere else now.”

On Friday morning in Memphis International Airport, a pilot ordered two Muslim clerics, traveling to a religious conference, off a plane, The Commercial Appeal reports. Both men had been screened by the Transportation Security Administration, and were cleared. They were also subject to additional security screening at the gate. They boarded the Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight and the plane left the gate, only to have the pilot turn around and expel the two men.
One of the men, Masudur Rahman, an adjunct instructor of Arabic at the University of Memphis, said they were told the pilot refused to accept them because some other passengers could be uncomfortable. As both men were clerics, they were dressed in the traditional garb, including skullcaps. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American Islamic Relations, called the incident a “Juan Williams thing,” in reference to the former NPR correspondent who said he was leery of flying with people in Muslim garb.
After Osama bin Laden's death, a closer eye has been placed on security, fearing retaliation from Al Qaeda and other extremist groups, as those groups have threatened. In Los Angeles, for example, massive security upgrades are planned for the rail lines, including a chemical-detection system and scores of new video surveillance cameras.
COLUMBIA, South Carolina — Hillary Clinton dealt Bernie Sanders a bruising defeat in South Carolina's Democratic primary Saturday, with early returns showing her crushing the insurgent senator by a 3-to-1 margin.
While the win was no surprise, it was still one of the best nights of Clinton's second attempt at the presidency thus far because it proved the basic electoral theory of her campaign: That a strong advantage among minority voters would carry her to her party's nomination — and potentially all the way to the White House.
The resounding victory makes it clear that Sanders, despite his best efforts, has been unable to address his fundamental weakness with black voters.

African Americans represented 61 percent of the turnout in the sate's Democratic presidential primary — up from 57 percent in 2008 — and Sanders lost the group 84 percent to 16 percent, according to NBC News exit polls.
If Sanders couldn't close the gap among African Americans in South Carolina, where he had the most time, money, and resources devoted to introducing himself to the community, then it will be all the more difficult in upcoming states.
Sanders made a real effort to compete here, hiring more than 200 paid canvassers and visiting the state on numerous occasions.

But for African Americans, who have known and liked the Clinton family for more than 25 years, Sanders' effort was too little, too late — or perhaps doomed from the start.
Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state's top Democrat whose late endorsement for Clinton gave her an extra boost, said his state's voters had months to compare and contrast the candidates.
"Tonight, the Democratic voters of South Carolina have rendered a significant verdict," Clyburn said at Clinton's victory rally in Columbia.

Clinton has now demonstrated massive victories among African Americans in two very different states on opposite sides of the country — Nevada and South Carolina — suggesting that their loyalty to her, and the so-called firewall built on that loyalty, will hold.
The margins raise the real possibility Clinton could take a major pledged delegate lead in next week's Super Tuesday contests, when six southern states with large African-American populations will hold nominating contests at once.
Even under the rosiest scenarios for Sanders, it will be hard for him to catch Clinton on Super Tuesday.
Sanders was not in South Carolina Saturday night, instead campaigning in Minnesota ahead of that state's Tuesday primary. But in a statement released shortly after polls closed, the Vermont senator vowed to continue his fight.
"Let me be clear on one thing tonight. This campaign is just beginning. We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina," Sanders said. "Our grassroots political revolution is growing state by state, and we won't stop now."
Sanders' supporters were braced for the loss, but the drubbing will be a test of his small-dollar fundraising apparatus, which is the lifeblood of his campaign.

Clinton supporters, meanwhile, are likely to begin urging Sanders to drop out of the race so she can begin to focus on the general election.
"I don't see a path forward for Bernie Sanders. The sooner he gets out the better," said Boyd Brown, a Democratic National Committee member from South Carolina who supports Clinton.
At a high-energy victory party in massive gymnasium here, Clinton beamed as she took the stage to chants of "madam president!"
The former secretary of state suggested she was looking to the next phase of the campaign, the general election campaign after that, and even her potential presidency. “Tomorrow, this campaign goes national,” she declared.
With exit polls showing that Clinton won black voters by an even larger margin than Barack Obama beat her with in 2008, the win bolsters her plan to reassemble the divers coalition that twice put President Obama in the White House for a third Democratic win.
"Despite what you hear, we don't need to make America great again — America has never stopped being great," Clinton said, making it clear she was already setting at least one eye on Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner.

Climate change is no longer a doomsday theory about our distant future - it's here. Farmers around the world are already dealing with more variable climates and dramatic weather events, like the drought in California and gigantic typhoons in Asia.
So what can be done?
In light of the fact that today so few of the planet's residents seem willing or able to reform old habits, farmers - especially those in developing nations - will have to adjust to climate change as fast, and as cheaply, as possible. Or, in the parlance of those who study climate change, they will have to both "mitigate" to lessen the effects of climate change and "adapt" to their new surroundings.
Often, feeding the world in the face of climate change is viewed as a solely technological problem. If we could just get farmers new and improved drought resistant seeds, the argument goes, or more fertilizer, yields could rise and everyone could eat.
But researchers at the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) - a global consortium of major agricultural research groups with almost 10,000 scientists and staff around the world - says very low-tech adaptation and mitigation strategies for farmers is essential in the face of changing weather. In fact, many of the methods farmers can use to adapt to increased variability will also make their farm more resilient and (mitigation).
"A simple example is, if a farmer increases organic matter in soil, that increases the carbon storage – a mitigation function - but more organic matter also means better water capacity," says Sonja Vermeulen, the Head of Research for CCAFS. "So that means you are much better able to deal with delayed onset of rains, or dry spells which are the kinds of problems farmers deal with under climate change."
The graphic below - created by Column Five Media for CCAFS - depicts strategies believed to be most important for farmers in the developing world. Holistic approaches like diversifying farms, agroforestry (combining trees with crops), and adapting more sustainable farming techniques will be the key to making farmers more resilient. For more information on climate change in agriculture, see CCAFS's newly designed website.
The BC Liberal Party says it is returning nearly $100,000 to donors after a Globe and Mail investigation revealed lobbyists had made indirect contributions that obscured the source of the money – a practice that is now the focus of an RCMP investigation.
The party issued a statement late Friday afternoon that said it had identified 43 contributions totalling $92,874.36 in which donors used their personal credit cards and were later reimbursed. The statement acknowledges such donations are "prohibited."
In addition, the Liberals say 30 people approached the party to report "clerical errors" that resulted in donations being recorded as personal donations rather than contributions from their employers. The party says it will notify Elections BC of those errors and will "proceed as required," though it did not confirm whether those donations would also be returned.

Investigation: How B.C. lobbyists are breaking one of the province's few political donation rules
Explainer: Political donations in Canada: A guide to the 'wild west' vs. the rest
The Globe investigation prompted Elections BC to launch a probe, later handed over to the RCMP, into the fundraising practices of the province's political parties. The governing Liberals and the opposition New Democrats also announced reviews of their own fundraising records.
"Much of the confusion around these issues has taken place as more contributions and ticket purchases have moved online," said the statement from Liberal spokesman Emile Scheffel, who added the party has made changes to its online payment system.
Mr. Scheffel declined to reveal the names of the problem donors, citing the RCMP investigation.
Political fundraising has been shaping up as a potential campaign issue ahead of the spring election.
Premier Christy Clark has responded by announcing an independent panel to review the province's election laws, which impose few limits on who can donate or on the size of their donations. Ms. Clark has also proposed more frequent disclosure, which her party recently began doing voluntarily.

The governing Liberals have been criticized for cash-for-access events in which donors pay thousands of dollars for a chance to sit down with the Premier. Ms. Clark was also criticized for accepting a $50,000 yearly stipend from her party, in addition to her salary as Premier. She announced earlier this year she would no longer take the stipend but instead be reimbursed by the party for expenses.
Glen Sanford, deputy director of the B.C. New Democrats, said the Liberals statement left unanswered questions.
"Let's start with who were the donors involved? It doesn't address at all the serious allegations that [The Globe and Mail] revealed," he said.
He also wondered why the party's statement did not say it was also returning money to 30 people who reported "clerical errors."
"They may be clerical errors, but they're also improper donations. And when we checked with Elections BC, they referred us to the section of the Elections Act that said improper donations need to be returned within 30 days," he said.
The NDP earlier this month returned cash to two donors after an internal review found the contributions had been improper. One donation of $7,250 had been attributed to an individual donor who bought tickets to a fundraiser and was later reimbursed by their employer. The second donation was for $1,500 and also involved a person who was later reimbursed by their employer.

Green Party leader Andrew Weaver said the problems surfacing with lobbyists' donations could be avoided if the government simply banned contributions from corporations and unions.
"The donations should not have been there in the first place," Mr. Weaver said in an interview. "And if they had actually done what people have been calling for, which is ban corporate and union donations, we wouldn't be in this position."
The Green Party banned corporate and union donations last year.
Democracy Watch co-founder Duff Conacher said he was surprised to see the Liberals say individuals and organizations were "unaware that reimbursements were not permitted under the [Elections] Act."
"Ignorance of the law is not an excuse," Mr. Conacher said. "I think all of these people should be prosecuted because they made an illegal donation."
He'd like to see that happen before the provincial election in May.

"It sounds like all the facts are there – those facts should be turned over to the RCMP and the prosecution should proceed."
XML vs. JSON: A Security Perspective
David Petty Blocked Unblock Follow May 15, 2017
The JSON vs. XML wars are brutal like trying to till a rough patch of land that returns no gain. Understanding the security considerations of both is like a green pasture providing a fruitful harvest of knowledge.
The age-old question of which is better between XML and JSON has been a hot topic on the Internet as JSON has risen in prevalence. JSON has been relevant since its adoption in popular web services in the mid-2000s. XML, is older, having been around since 1998 when the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) officially recommended it.
XML and JSON are both universal formats for arbitrary data sharing between computer architectures and programs, but there are a number of differences between them. These differences have motivated blog posts and other documents on the Internet comparing the two, and a compilation of even a couple of these resources would cover most of their functional advantages and disadvantages. However, in my research I haven't seen a comprehensive comparison of the two standards that addresses the security considerations of using one or the other, and these are important for any developer trying to minimize a web API's attack surface. Hence, the purpose of this blog is to gather this information into one place so XML or JSON developers can understand the functional reasons to choose one over the other in addition to the security precautions that they should take with either choice.
Before I dive into the security aspects, it's important to know the functional differences between XML and JSON. If you're already familiar with these, it may be useful to skip to the Security section.
Similarities
Before diving into their differences, it's important to first summarize what XML and JSON have in common:
1. Both are widely used data sharing standards with publicly available documentation.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4825 (XML)
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159 (JSON)
2. Both are self-describing and human-readable: self-describing in that they are represented as a hierarchical tree of metadata, and human-readable in that the data itself is ASCII and Unicode characters.
3. Libraries for working with both exist for many programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, Perl, Ruby, and more.
4. Client JavaScript code may access responses in both languages through asynchronous requests with the XMLHttpRequest object, despite its name.
Simplicity and Parsing
In terms of simplicity and parsing speed, JSON has the advantage in most cases. Its syntax is usually less verbose because XML requires beginning and end tags for each branch of the data tree while JSON represents data in arrays with name/value pairs. Examples of both representations of the same data are shown below.
XML (174 characters)
<document id="1" name="test">
<dimensions>
<width>10</width>
<height>15</height>
</dimensions>
<objects>
<object id="1">
<object id="2">
</objects>
<window onclick="openDoc()" />
</document>
JSON (155 characters)
{"document": {
"id": "1",
"name": "test",
"dimensions": {
"width": "10",
"height": "15"
}
"objects": {
"object": [
{"id"= "1"},
{"id"= "2"}
]
}
"window": {
"onclick":"openDoc()"
}
}}
Due to syntax differences, programs can usually parse JSON faster than XML. This is not only because JSON generally uses fewer characters, but because its syntax better matches object-oriented languages' data structures, especially JavaScript. These languages have libraries for parsing both JSON and XML, but generally there's a standard minimal JSON parser that's more intuitive than the XML counterpart(s). The official JSON site summarizes JSON's advantages. Some other resources that favor JSON are a Cloud Elements blog and a w3schools page.
Extensibility
The reason JSON is usually simpler and faster is because it has limited support for data types, i.e., only strings and numbers that can be organized into arrays. This standardizes how it can be parsed, but it also restricts the flexibility of what types of documents the receiving program can parse. There are a number of advantages to XML's complexity:
1. XML's user-defined elements make it a better option for more complicated documents that include images, charts, or other non-primitive types.
2. XML gives the ability for the user to set metadata within a specific data's tag in the form of attributes, for example, <document id="1" name="test"> in the code above, and this could help a developer better organize the information.
3. XML allows resolving name collisions through namespaces, which may be useful for client programs that need two variables of the same name in different scopes. w3schools provides a summary of namespaces and how to implement them.
4. XML documents can be validated using a Schema document that the XML document references as it is transferred from server to server. The parser uses the schema to validate the structure of the XML data to make sure it maintains a specific syntax. An example can found here.
5. There are some powerful tools for reading and writing to XML documents, including XPath for querying nodes or values and XSL for modifying and displaying documents.
Here is a blog defending XML that summarizes these advantages.
Security
As shown in the previous sections, many blogs and articles address the XML vs. JSON debate, and the opinions vary from favoring one over the other to a neutral stance. I, too, would take a neutral stance because, in terms of functionality, one is not necessarily better than the other; they both are a better fit for different data transfers.
However, the security aspects of using one or the other is often ignored, but they are incredibly important because, unlike functional inefficiencies, insecure implementations can lead to the exploitation of a system. Both XML and JSON parsers have security considerations of which developers should be aware.
XML
There are a number of security issues involved in the configuration of XML parsers and how they interact with the document structure, and these need to be addressed in order to properly secure an application that is utilizing XML.
XML External Entity Injection (XXE)
XXE arises when an application resolves arbitrary external entities defined in an XML document. External entities are like macros that expand to a local or remote resource through a system identifier. This identifier is assumed to be a URL that the XML parser processes, and then all instances of the external entity within the XML document are replaced with the contents of the external resource. An attacker can exploit this to obtain sensitive data on the application's machine or perform remote code execution. Here's a classic XXE example:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY>
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]
<credentials>
<user>&xxe;</user>
<pass>somevalue</pass>
</credentials>
Here the attacker has modified the XML document to include an external entity referencing the local machine's /etc/passwd file. If the server allows unrestricted external entity expansion, the contents of this file could be reflected any server response derived from the XML input, and the attacker would obtain user information from the server.
The external entity could also reference URLs as a way to bypass firewall restrictions that permit access from the exploited server but not from an outside address. The attacker could then potentially access privileged information through HTTP GET responses that are reflected in the webpage UI. OWASP gives a more in-depth explanation of XXE with more attack examples.
Another area of XXE attacks is resource exhaustion, which can utilize a couple different payloads, including generic and recursive entity expansion. In these attack payloads, a large number of external entities are declared that reference each other, and when the server is forced to evaluate all of them, it runs out of memory and crashes. This attack is also called an “XML Bomb”. A ws-attacks wiki article summarizes these attacks.
Similarly, the attacker may be able to carry out a remote code execution using the PHP expect module, but the server must have this module loaded, and this type of XXE occurs rarely. The OWASP vulnerability page mentioned above also includes an example for this attack.
Remediation: XXE attacks can be prevented by simply disabling external entity substitution or expansion. The terminology can vary with each XML parser, and further, disabling DTDs entirely is the safest option. The problem is external entity expansion is often enabled by default, but is rarely necessary for legitimate functionality. OWASP provides a guide for XXE prevention.
XML DTD Validation
Another vulnerability that can be exploited in the default configuration of XML parsers is the validation against untrusted external DTD (Document Type Declaration) files. The DTD of an XML document is one way to define the valid structure of the document, i.e., rules for what elements and values are allowed. These rules can be implemented internally within the document's DTD, or can be loaded externally by referencing a file or URL. An example external declaration would look like this:
<!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM "http://www.example.com/schema.dtd">
<foo>
...
</foo>
A security problem arises if the server's XML parser accepts an arbitrary external DTD URL and attempts to download the DTD and validate the XML document against it. In this case, an attacker could input any URL and execute a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack where the attacker forces the server to make a request to the target URL. The server may have privileges to access certain resources that the attacker doesn't, and the attacker can leverage this to scan and attack services behind the server's firewall. A summary of SSRF can be found here.
Remediation: Disabling DTDs completely (i.e., as in a non-validating XML parser) would mitigate this vulnerability.
JSON
As a simple data format with no document-based configurations, merely parsing a JSON document is not open to security misconfiguration. However, given that JSON is designed to be a subset of JavaScript, it is tempting to parse a JSON document by simply passing it to a JavaScript engine (e.g., the eval method). Certain implementations of JSON exchanges in JavaScript work this way and can open up an application to vulnerabilities, e.g., through JSONP.
JSONP
JSONP was developed as a way for developers to exchange JSON data across different domains outside the restrictions of the Same-Origin Policy. It's simply a modified version of a JSON data exchange where the target URL is stored in a src attribute within <script> tags, and the JSON data being accessed is passed to a JavaScript callback function. Because browsers evaluate JavaScript in the context of where it is embedded, the JSONP request that is downloaded and executed by the client is not restricted from interacting with the calling page by the Same-Origin Policy. For information on the Same-Origin Policy, there are many resources on the Internet, e.g., here.
The following illustrates a JSONP exchange.
A webpage could use the following to make a JSONP request to a resource on another server, example.com:
<script
type="application/javascript"
src="http://example.com/someFile?callback=someFunc">
</script>
The client visiting this page would receive a response with a JSON-wrapped function like the one shown below. The function then executes with the JSON data as input. For the exchange to function properly, the receiving server must be configured with a JSONP API to send this response.
someFunc({"name": "foo", "id": 1});
JSONP is dangerous because it allows cross-origin exchanges of data. If “example.com” were compromised, the attacker could send arbitrary JavaScript code to execute in the context of the page holding the <script> tag, rather than a callback function and JSON document.
Another exploit would be a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. An attacker could trick a victim into visiting a malicious webpage that creates a JSONP request to a third-party site utilizing a JSONP API. Depending on the request and the requested data, the server may respond with sensitive JSON data (e.g., usernames, passwords, credit card information, etc.) that would be disclosed to the attacker. For this CSRF attack to succeed, the JSONP server endpoint would need to use cookies for authentication and not implement CSRF protection (e.g., CSRF tokens).
It's important to note that JSONP is a security risk that developers must choose to take by implementing its functionality. Unlike the XML issues, this is not the default behavior of JSON web exchanges.
TL;DR
In terms of functionality, XML and JSON are similar in a lot of ways, and their differences provide advantages depending on the context of the application's data types. Overall, one is not better than the other. In regard to security, processing untrusted Internet-facing requests is one of the most basic functions of an XML or JSON parser. Unfortunately, common XML parsers are not suitable for this purpose in their default configuration; only with hardening to disable external entity expansion and external DTD validation are they safe. Conversely, JSON parsing is almost always safe, so long as the programmer uses modern techniques rather than JSONP. As long as web developers are aware of these security risks and take the steps to defend against them, either option is completely viable in the current web environment.
Uber service appeared to be briefly disrupted in Paris amid a series of deadly attacks Friday night that wreaked havoc on transportation systems across the city and kept many bus and train stations closed into Saturday morning. Uber service was fully available again by Saturday morning.
“Our hearts go out to everyone in France after these horrific terrorist attacks,” an Uber spokesperson said.
More than 120 people were killed in the coordinated attacks. President Francois Hollande shut France's borders and declared a national state of emergency, saying, “This is a terrible test, another assault on France.”
Parisian Uber users saw an “Emergency Situation” message when opening the app that said: “Attacks are underway in Paris and its surroundings. The Prefecture of Police of Paris has asked that you stay safely inside. Do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Nearly all the drivers are busy. Uber France.” An Uber spokesman said service was not suspended but that there was a “huge demand” and no cars available because all drivers are busy. “You can't realize what is happening, it's a nightmare,” the spokesman said.

The message changed from earlier, when it read: “Service Disrupted: We're doing the maximum to help Parisians in their travel, and particularly tonight. If possible, submit your travel [request] later. Take care of yourself, Team Uber.”
Parisians also began using the hashtag #PorteOuverte, which means “open door,” to offer shelter for those seeking safety.

UPDATED at 5:30 p.m. with response from College Station official:
COLLEGE STATION – The Tweet heard 'round the college football world was much ado about something minor, but one more example of how the most scrutinized college athlete in the nation has followers dissecting his every word.
Texas A&M sophomore quarterback Johnny Manziel's frustrated Twitter post at 1:38 a.m. Sunday morning claiming it's “(expletive) like tonight is a reason why I can't wait to leave college station … whenever it may be,” was over a parking ticket, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
Manziel, the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner, had been fishing in Port Aransas on Saturday and was still on the coast, according to the insider, when he talked over the phone to an officer, who wrote him a ticket for being parked the wrong way in front of his house and for his windows being tinted too dark (his Mercedes was in College Station while he was with friends in Port Aransas). Manziel tweeted out his frustrations in dealing with the matter, quickly removed the post, followed with a tweet that he loved A&M but for people to please walk in a day in his shoes.
A College Station official said Wednesday late afternoon that any interaction that night occurred between the officer and Manziel's roommate, and police did not talk to Manziel. The official added that the ticket was written as the result of a driver complaining he or she had nearly hit Manziel's parked car that night, and that the driver also complained about the car's window tinting. The official said no ticket was written for the tinting.
There were no keys left at Manziel's house for the roommate to move the car, according to the official, therefore a ticket was written.
A&M nearly didn't have a Heisman winner on its hands to fret over this past season, either, after he nearly transferred last summer, according to the insider and first reported by the Dallas Morning News on Tuesday evening.
Manziel was arrested in the Northgate bar district last June for fighting, failing to identify himself and possessing two fake IDs, and as a result the university arbitrarily suspended him for the football season, according to multiple insiders.
Manziel was preparing to transfer to a junior college to play immediately when the suspension was overturned on appeal midway through training camp – and the next day he was named the starting quarterback over Jameill Showers, who intends to play at UTEP this fall.
Multiple insiders said the athletic department had nothing to do with Manziel's suspension – a suspension overturned by the dean of student life. A “status of compliance” hearing is set for July 15 concerning the arrest.
As everyone knows by now, including his more than 370,000 followers on Twitter, Manziel went on to star for the 11-2 Aggies during their first season in the Southeastern Conference.

Dr. Jordan Peterson's scheduled talk at Linfield next Monday has been canceled after ASLC pulled funding for it due to stipulations not being met by Peterson and the event requester, Young Americans for Liberty, according to an email sent to students by Susan Agre-Kippenhan, vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty.
The talk will now take place at the Falls Event Center Evergreen Museum in McMinnville, which will begin at 7 p.m. on Monday, April 24.
Peterson, who is a free speech activist, philosopher and psychologist, tweeted on Tuesday to his 107,000 Twitter followers, “I'm violating more safe spaces soon: Linfield College.”
In response to Peterson's tweet, Agre-Kippenhan said that Linfield's Anti-Harassment Protection and Academic Freedom policy states that “anti-harassment policies are not intended to limit the free exchange of opinions or the vigorous debate over ideas.”
She states further that “intimidation, harassment, exploitation, and the use or threat of force are incompatible with the preservation of this freedom.”
The stipulations YAL needed to complete were that the event needed to be a closed Linfield event, which means no publicizing outside of Linfield community. It needed a contract, and the contract had to include what the speaker was going to talk about.
“We cannot welcome speakers when the stipulations for their appearances are not met and who intend to violate the safety of our community,” Agre-Kippenhan said.
“The speaker's organization sent out a press release that invited more than just the Linfield Community,” ASLC Cabinet President Nathan Pellatz said.
“We did not get a contract until 18 hours after the deadline, and it did not contain what the speaker was talking about. It was because of all these factors, the decision was made to pull funding for the Jordan Peterson event,” Pellatz said.
Senior Parker Wells, a member of YAL, was the coordinator for Peterson's appearance at Linfield.
“I've put forth my most genuine effort in being respectful and communicative while coordinating this event,” Wells said. “Unfortunately, the school has seized on circumstances outside of our control in order to cancel it.”
“Students and faculty alike were excited about the opportunity to exchange ideas with Peterson. We in the ideological minority on campus are greatly disheartened to see that opportunity taken away,” Wells said.
Britain has joined a war against Islamic State (Isis) within a political framework that guarantees frustration if not failure. The House of Commons was rightly wary of another open-ended foreign intervention in Iraq, Syria or anywhere else. But, while MPs are conscious that Britain is entering a minefield, they were much less good at identifying where the mines are and what, if anything, can be done about them. As in 2003, the US and Britain are plugging themselves into a series of inter-related conflicts in Iraq and Syria in which the main players have very different agendas from what they pretend.
Take the current Isis offensive against the Kurdish enclave of Kobane in northern Syria on the border with Turkey, where 300,000 Kurds are squeezed into a smaller and smaller enclave as they battle better armed Isis fighters. Some 200,000 Syrian Kurds have already fled across the Turkish border. Here, if anywhere, the US could have deployed its airpower to attack the advancing militants. It was US air strikes that helped to save the Iraqi Kurdish capital Erbil in August so why not do the same for Kobane?
Strangely, until yesterday the US was using its airpower everywhere in Syria except Kobane where Isis has launched its most serious offensive since US air attacks on Syria began. It has seized 64 villages, using tanks and artillery barrages from guns captured from the Iraqi and Syrian armies. Why the American reticence? It appears to be motivated by a wish not to offend Turkey which never cared for the semi-independent Kurdish cantons, home to many of Syria's 2.5 million-strong Kurdish minority, that have grown up across its southern border since 2011.
Its actions are strong evidence that Ankara can see the advantages of using Isis against the Kurds. Reporters on the ground on the Turkish side of the border say that Isis militants still found it easy last week to cross backwards and forwards, unlike Turkish Kurds wanting to fight Isis. An observer in Turkey asks the question: “Why Isis fighters are still being taken across the border into Turkey to be treated in hospital for their combat wounds, when medical staff treating non-violent but injured protesters in Gezi Square are put on trial for ‘assisting terrorism'?”
For all Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's statements at the UN in New York that he opposes Isis, the militants receive a degree of toleration from the Turkish state. This was graphically illustrated by pictures on successive days last week of police treatment of two demonstrations in Istiklal Caddesi in the heart of Istanbul. The first shows pro-Isis demonstrators holding a long white banner untroubled by the police. The second picture shows a group in the same street the following day protesting at the imposition of religious education who are being beaten by police in full riot gear.
It is not that the Turkish government is hand in glove with Isis, but that getting rid of President Bashar al-Assad as well as weakening the Syrian Kurds has been higher up Mr Erdoğan's agenda. By going along with this, the US is committing the same mistake it made in Afghanistan after 2001 when it failed to respond to Pakistan's covert but crucial backing for the Taliban. Several US diplomats later saw this as a massive error that doomed from the start American and British intervention in Afghanistan.
The point to keep in mind here, as Britain makes its first largely symbolic military intervention in Iraq, is that there are limits to what can be achieved by military means in this crisis. This is being obscured by the bombast accompanying the first days of military action with military experts pontificating about the terrible damage being done to those targeted and television viewers ghoulishly watching pictures of missiles and bombs destroying supposed Isis command and control centres.
But Isis is a guerrilla army with long experience of being bombed by the American, Iraqi and Syrian air forces. It is worth recalling that the US had 150,000 soldiers in Iraq and an air armada overhead at the height of its intervention in Iraq in 2007 and still failed to eliminate al-Qaeda in Iraq and other Sunni resistance groups. There is no reason it should be any different this time round.
There is a role in Iraq and Syria for foreign airpower to act as a fire brigade to stop Isis from storming Erbil in August or taking Kobane now. But go beyond this limited but important role and air strikes swiftly become counter-effective. It all depends on whose interests in these multi-faceted civil wars that airpower is being employed. It is here that political ignorance or self-deception becomes so dangerous, such as that of British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon declaring that we would be using British air strikes in support of Iraq's newly formed inclusive and representative government under Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. This administration is apparently acceptable to Iraqi Sunni, unlike that of the violently sectarian Shia-dominated government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
The impression given by Mr Fallon is that if American, British or French air strikes help to clear the way for the Kurdish peshmerga or the Iraqi army, then they will be greeted with open arms by the Sunni of Mosul. Except that none of this is true. The new Iraqi government is much like the old and equally, if less overtly, sectarian. The most effective fighting force of the Baghdad government is the Iranian-managed Shia militias of which the Sunni are terrified and with some reason.
ORDER IT NOW
I had experience of this in 2003 when Kurdish peshmerga captured overwhelmingly Sunni Mosul after advancing under an American air umbrella. The Iraqi army was breaking up so there was no resistance in Mosul until the Kurds moved in. At first there was jubilation that Saddam Hussein had fallen, but this was rapidly replaced by fear and anger that the Kurds were in charge. Shooting began as loudspeakers called for vigilantes to build barricades and stop the Kurds. I had driven from Erbil with a Kurdish driver called Yusuf who was almost lynched when a crowd leaving a Sunni mosque noticed that our vehicle had licence plates from a Kurdish province. I had walked into medieval Christian quarter but when I got back I found that Yusuf was looking shaken and said that he had almost been killed by a hostile crowd in which one man kept shouting: “Let's kill him and burn the car.”
What Britain should be doing in addition to sending the Tornadoes is to do everything possible to get negotiations going between the main outside players in the Iraq-Syria crisis. These would include the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran as well as inside players such as the Syrian government, Syrian Kurds and non-Isis opposition to Assad. The only way to eliminate Isis long term is to look for a way of de-escalating the crisis so that local parties do not all feel that they are fighting for their lives. Isis is essentially a war machine, and so long as the Syrian war goes on it cannot be beaten.
BATON ROUGE, La. — The East Baton Rouge Parish Metro Council has voted 8-4 vote to reject a proposed local law banning discrimination against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
The Baton Rouge Advocate reports the proposal generated weeks of passionate debate about the legal protections for LGBT people in the capital city.
But not long after it was introduced, it became clear that the measure was unlikely to win over a majority of the council Wednesday night.
Ultimately, the council voted 8-4 against the measure.
Council member Ronnie Edwards said she felt the fairness ordinance left out too many groups of people who are also discriminated against, including women, people living in poverty, people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, overweight people and ex-convicts.
Edwards said an ordinance alone would not end discrimination.
Council member John Delgado, who supported the ordinance, said he will actively work to bring the measure before voters.

New Zealand studio Grinding Gear Games has done a good job maintaining Path of Exile with updates since the free-to-play action RPG released in late 2013. Soon, they'll be putting the biggest set of weapons, skill jewels, levels, and other stuff to date in an expansion called The Awakening, "Act 4" of PoE. Grinding Gear stopped by our office earlier this week to show it off.
Path of Exile: The Awakening is making significant additions to the base game's core systems and story. You'll wade into Highgate, exploring the home of “The Beast,” a big bad who's awakening could trigger a cataclysm. Within Highgate, Grinding Gear showed me levels that were constructed from the dreams of characters in Path of Exile lore. There was Daresso's Dream, a muddy area that had the look of WWI trenches mixed with a Roman arena. The level itself culminated in an arena-style fight, a reflection of Daresso's history as a character. Grinding Gear says there will be nine “act boss-caliber” boss fights in The Awakening, some of whom will be against legendary figures from Wraeclast's past, like Voll, Kaom, and Daresso himself.
More exciting, maybe, are the changes you'll be able to make to existing characters and the new builds that The Awakening's new items should inspire. Path of Exile is known for its ludicrous skill tree, but instead of simply making that sprawling web of icons more enormous, Grinding Gear are adding new socketable jewels that have interesting effects over a radius within the skill tree—see above. They're adding AOE effects within the skill tree, essentially. One jewel they showed me, Eldritch Knowledge, gave +1% increased chaos damage per 10 INT from allocated passives in radius. So if you could find a spot in the tree where you'd already allocated a lot of intelligence bonus-granting skills, you could stack a bunch of chaos damage atop that. Other jewels I saw are more mechanical than stat-driven: Selfless Leadership applies bonuses from passives within the radius to your minions instead of you, and Intuitive Leap grants you the passives within a radius while being able to ignore their requirements.
Grinding Gear's goal is to give players exciting tools and ideas to play with. “We love it when the community comes up with a build that we've never seen before,” producer and lead programmer Jonathan Rogers told me. Partly because the possibilities presented by this new mechanic are so great, however, Grinding Gear will run a beta for The Awakening beginning April 20. You can sign up for it here.
The Awakening will also add new equipment (Maraketh weapons) and more than 70 new unique items to bring against now double the number of different enemies. I saw Empire's Grasp, a pair of Goliath Gauntlets that reversed knockback damage—the item would essentially pull enemies toward you, which is especially useful against some bosses, Grinding Gear told me. There was also Sire of Shards, which caused socketed gems to fire their spell in a nova, encouraging you to get right into the middle of enemies so your spell could erupt from all directions.
Grinding Gear says they'll also be touching up other details of the game, like UI presentation and gameplay options, in the expansion. PoE's also being rebalanced for new players to make their entry into the game a bit smoother. I'm surprised that a new character class isn't part of the bundle, but otherwise this seems like a massive wave of new toys and new content for hardcore left-clickers to play with.
The New Horizons spacecraft experienced an anomaly this afternoon that led to a loss of communication with Earth. Communication has since been reestablished and the spacecraft is healthy.
The mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Maryland, lost contact with the unmanned spacecraft -- now 10 days from arrival at Pluto -- at 1:54 p.m. EDT, and regained communications with New Horizons at 3:15 p.m. EDT, through NASA's Deep Space Network.
During that time the autonomous autopilot on board the spacecraft recognized a problem and – as it's programmed to do in such a situation – switched from the main to the backup computer. The autopilot placed the spacecraft in “safe mode,” and commanded the backup computer to reinitiate communication with Earth. New Horizons then began to transmit telemetry to help engineers diagnose the problem.
A New Horizons Anomaly Review Board was convened at 4 p.m. EDT to gather information on the problem and initiate a recovery plan. The team is now working to return New Horizons to its original flight plan. Due to the 9-hour, round trip communication delay that results from operating a spacecraft almost 3 billion miles (4.9 billion kilometers) from Earth, full recovery is expected to take from one to several days; New Horizons will be temporarily unable to collect science data during that time.
Status updates will be issued as new information is available.
I arrived home today in anticipation of opening my gift, as I saw it had been delivered. All I knew was that it weighed 2.1 pounds and was coming from a state bordering mine. So I arrive home and there it is on my stoop! Though unassuming, it stated on the outside that it was from Santa, so I knew... this is it! After careful inspection, I opened the box to find... another box, but this one was beautifully and festively wrapped! I then took a break to eat some french fries, because I hadn't eaten yet today and didn't want to faint with excitement and low blood sugar. Returning to my package, I opened it and inside was a wonderful and thoughtful card explaining why my gift was chosen. Then on to the gift itself. To be honest, probably 1 of those 2.1 pounds was the tissue paper protecting it. Ten minutes later, I was able to unveil to myself the most gorgeous handcrafted wind chime. What's so awesome about it is that not only does it totally go with what I like, but Santa somehow knew that a sound reminiscent of a beach would make me super happy! HOW DID YOU KNOW THE OCEAN IS MY HAPPY PLACE! Anyway, I am super excited to find a place for it in my home and to show it off to my cats. Maybe my friends too if they come over.
The curious case of a homeless Californian called Kai, Stephen Colbert said Tuesday, was cause for him to rethink his longstanding prejudice against ax-wielding hitchhikers.
Kai's story of impromptu heroism has become an online hit after his colorful interview with KMPH-TV last week, in which he explained how he saved a Pacific Gas & Electric worker and a witness from a man who claimed to be the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.
“Thanks to Kai, the man hit by the car is okay. The bystander is okay,” Colbert explained. “And for the first time in human history, people are saying, ‘Boy, we sure are lucky that homeless hitchhiker was carrying a hatchet.'”
Kai was hitching a ride with the suspect, identified by The Fresno Bee as 54-year-old Jett Simmons McBride, before the incident.
“He's like, ‘You know what? I come to realize, I'm Jesus Christ, and I can do anything I fucking want to,” Kai told the station. “And, [he said] ‘Watch this,' and he smashed into this fucking guy right there, pinned him between that fucking truck.”
The PG&E employee, who has asked not to be identified, is recovering from a broken leg after being pinned between the suspect's car and a company truck. McBride then allegedly attacked a woman who tried to stop him from driving off.
“He just kept saying he's Jesus Christ and he's going to save all of us,” said the witness, Tanya Baker. “But we have to get — he used the n-word, meaning the black people — he said we need to get them off the Earth.”
When McBride allegedly put Baker in a bearhug, Kai said, he went to her rescue.
“A guy that big can snap a woman's neck like a pencil stick,” he told the station. “So I fucking ran up behind him with a hatchet. Smash, smash, suh-mash! … Yeah.”
But Colbert pointed out that the suspect said he “came to realize” he was Jesus. If it happens to him, he said, Kai's response to the suspect made him sound like the kind of guy he wants there when it happens.
“Kai here is quoting Scripture,” said Colbert, a devout Catholic. “[Specifically] Matthew 25, which reads, ‘For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. Then one will be like, ‘Bro, if you're fucking Jesus Christ, I'll be the Anti-Christ, man, fuck that shit.'”
Watch Colbert's take on Kai's heroics, aired Tuesday on Comedy Central, below.

Imam Shamil: The Mujahid and Sufi who resisted an Empire
When you think of a sufi order in this day and age, physical Jihad isn't usually the first thing that comes to mind. But historically, and scripturally, Tasawwuf and Jihad aren't worlds apart like one might imagine these days. There are few better recent examples to show this than in the life of Imam Shamil, a noble Sheikh from the Caucasus who lived in the 1800s. He was well-educated, spiritually devout, and would ultimately lead the Muslim fight against the Russians in the Caucasian War of the 1800s. This article looks briefly at his life and valiant resistance.
The Caucasus
The area between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea is known as Dagestan and Caucasia. For centuries, adamant tribes lived an autonomous life in this mountainous location where dozens of ethnicities, languages and their dialects exist today.
Islam arrived in this region from two sides. Georgians, Laz and Circassians living in the Caucasus became Muslim through the Ottomans. Dagestan was already introduced to Islam through Arab merchants in the early centuries of the rise of Islam. Being pressured between the Russian and Persian Empires over years, Caucasus and Dagestan got closer to the Ottomans. Unable to stand against imperial Russia's goals, Muslims in the Caucasus migrated to Anatolia in masses from 1864.
The relations between Dagestan and Muslims in the Ottoman Caliphate date back longer. For some time in the 16th century Dagestan was an Ottoman province. From 1747 onward, Dagestan was invaded by the Russians. The Russian army under Gen. Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov suppressed the people's resistance in 1819. In 1830, tribes in Dagestan declared jihad against Russia. Imam Shamil was the legendary figure who led resistance against the Russians.
From noble roots
Born in 1797, Imam Shamil was the son of a religious and noble Avar family. Avars are a native Caucasian ethnic group that lives in the north Caucasus between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Earlier, Avars were a Turkic community that established a khanate extending from Central Asia to central Europe in the sixth century. They laid siege to Istanbul and crossed the Bosporus on horseback. The Avars came apart after Frankish attacks in 805 and mingled among local people in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Some of them, who settled in Dagestan, learned local language of Lezgi people and adopted Islam in the 13th Century.
Belonging to an ethnicity that marked such history was something like a harbinger of Imam Shamil's bright life. His name was changed from Ali to Shamil because he frequently got sick, and according to a folk tradition, changing someone's name brings health. After Shamil got a traditional education in his village, he was enlightened by Jamaluddin al-Ghumuqi, a sheikh from the Naqshbandi sufi order. He married Ghumuqi's daughter and later went to Damascus to meet Ghumuqi's famous teacher Khalid al-Baghdadi. There Imam Shamil gained an advanced level of knowledge in religious sciences.
Experience out in the field
When he returned home, he took part in the resistance against the Russian Empire facilitated by his childhood friend Ghazi Muhammad. Russian forces killed his friend in 1832. When Hamza Bek, who led counterattacks after Ghazi Muhammad's death, was also killed in 1834, Dagestani mujahidin chose Imam Shamil, who was 39 years old then, as their imam.
Imam Shamil re-organized the mujahidin. With a height over 2 meters, an athletic appearance, strength, knowledge, articulation and an unbreakable faith, he gained the trust of people around him. He formed a fully-established military unit against the Russians. These mujahidin became a nightmare for Russian armies; Russians responded with crowded military forces and heavy weapons to Imam Shamil's defiance with basic arms from 1834-1859. Their stubborn resistance in the Caucasus was heard all around the world.
Adept administration
He established regents in the areas under his control. Five regents formed a province and an emir was assigned to each province responsible for religious and life affairs. Regents collected taxes and soldiers as well as acting as judges. In each village, a qadi (judge) was in charge responsible for maintaining security, writing correspondences to regents and declaring orders to the public. Each regent was also responsible of looking after 300 cavalry men. In villages, a soldier was taken from each 10 homes and his family would be held not to pay taxes. The number of mujahideen reached 5,000 people in 1843. All men aged 15 to 50 had to be adept at horsemanship and using arms because they protected their homes by themselves from attacks. Imam Shamil provided arms partially from both the Ottomans and Persians. However, they had an old, big arms manufacturing plant built in a rocky area in Kubachi.
Imam Shamil had almost a 1,000-member special guard unit. They used to wear green turbans on a papakha made of galyak – fetal lamb pelt. Soldiers appeared in yellow Caucasian attire while officers wore traditional clothes in black. The group's sign was a square-shaped ash grey rag placed on the front of their hats.
Single soldiers were not allowed to marry while married soldiers were forbidden to meet their families during military service. They took a share from captured treasure. Imam Shamil's military forces became famous among the public as whichever village they went to, locals competed to treat them.
Russian rivalry
The Dargi War was the most famous victory of Imam Shamil's against Russian Imperial forces. A Russian army of 150,000 soldiers surrounded Dagestan and blocked the roads. Following a significant loss, Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, the leader of an advance guard with 18,000 soldiers heading to Imam Shamil's headquarters had to draw back from Dargi on July 25, 1845. Three generals, 195 officers and 3,433 soldiers were killed by Imam Shamil's forces. Vorontsov attempted to burn forests, which he saw as a big strategic advantage for Shamil, yet failed. In 1851, Hadji Murat, a regent of Imam Shamil, joined the Russian forces. Hadji Murat, who escaped with regret and then died tragically, was the protagonist of Leo Tolstoy's famous namesake novel.
Tsar Nicholas I of Russia twice wanted to personally meet Imam Shamil, whom he admired. Imam Shamil sent a refusal to the tsar's letter full of endless promises and bright offers. He was persistent in war and even further declared penalties on those who offered to negotiate with the Russians. Meanwhile, Imam Shamil's mother, who heard about Muslim villagers being tortured by Russians from two Chechens, asked her son to make an agreement with the Russians. It was a very famous account which described when Imam Shamil ordered 100 strokes of the cane for his mother as punishment, yet it was applied to him as he did not find it in his heart to carry out the punishment on her.
After the Crimean War in 1854 during which Imam Shamil's military forces supported the Ottoman army, Russians blocked the roads through where Shamil supplied arms. Russian forces bought some tribes to the point where they were unable to resist. Chechnya fell following a two-year struggle. Small groups left Imam Shamil afterwards and Dagestan was entirely surrounded. Still fighting against the Russians, Imam Shamil reached Gunib, a fortified village in Dagestan, with his family. He protected the fortress with his 400 soldiers, yet their number reduced to 100 following artillery fire from 14 well-armed Russian battalions. On Sept. 6, 1859, Imam Shamil surrendered with his two sons.
An agreement made between the Russians and Imam Shamil forced him to go to Istanbul with his companions.On the other side, Russians would not collect soldiers in Dagestan. However, Prince Baryatinski, the battle's victorious commander, did not keep his promise. Imam Shamil was brought to St. Petersburg. Strangely, Tsar Alexander II of Russia tried to please him with an unprecedented ceremony. During the feast in honour of Imam Shamil, the tsar said: “I am proudly honoured to host you at our table.”
Final years
Following a 10-year obligatory residence in Kaluga, Imam Shamil was allowed to go the Hijaz to observe his pilgrimage. He was hosted by Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz in Istanbul and Khedive Ismail Pasha in Egypt. Shamil could not return to Istanbul after his pilgrimage and died in Medina in 1871. He was buried in the Maqbaratul Baqī', the Baqi Cemetery in Medina.
Imam Shamil's son Ghazi Muhammad Pasha entered the Ottoman Caliphate's service. He managed the cavalry brigade on the Caucasus front during the 1877 Russo-Turkish War. His other son, Shafi, who was captured by the Russians, became the tsar's aide-de-camp and a Russian general. Said Shamil, his grandson from his youngest son Kamil Pasha, fought for the independence of Dagestan from 1918-1921, yet failed. He died in Istanbul.
There is much to value in the life and legend of Imam Shamil. He was most surely a stalwart defender of his domain, and may Allah reward him and his loyal allies for their endurance and determination in that regard.
For us, historical figures like the Imam are a lesson as to what tasawwuf was and how an authentic Sufism went hand in hand with shariah and jihad, in its roots. From what we know, Imam Shamil took his religion seriously, and we see that he would not hesitate to enter the battlefield, especially as he was called upon to defend the Muslims in his care. The Imam certainly makes for someone to look up to, and is an enduring figure of bravery and resistance worth pondering in our times.

In December 2015 he wrote 'if a kafir does not see you as a threat to his safety then you know you have something wrong with the way you practise the Deen [religion].' In March 2016 he changed his Facebook cover photo to a quote 'The Islamic State: a state for all Muslims, so let's participate together to build and protect it'. One of the videos he posted was titled 'Ramadan Under the Shades of the Khalifah', showing IS fighters attacking the Syrian Army. After the Paris and Brussels attacks he called on other Muslims to study the Quran to 'learn why those attacks were 100% right'. He also boasted on encrypted social media app, Telegram, that he had attended a protest outside the Israeli embassy with a homemade poster saying 'Hitler you were right.' As this is the UK, anybody is free to say what they want unless you are white Non-Muslim then you have no rights whatsoever. However The UK authorities were forced to act when poor little asylum features decided to upload on his facebook account the personal details of more than 56 US military personnel The details included email addresses, home addresses and names of their bases in the US and were attached to the hashtag "US Army pigs completely hacked". He wrote: "All praise to Allah alone"
“It was awkward and it was a viral loop. People tipped $150,000 in 10 days, and then a lot of people who got bitcoin… it sat there and they didn't do anything with it, ever.”
Blockai CEO Nathan Lands is referring to the spike in interest in first bitcoin project, QuickCoin, a Facebook-integrated wallet that sought to entice new users. That project has now evolved into Blockai (pronounced ‘block-i'), which takes a similar approach to spreading bitcoin, although it places more emphasis on the capabilities of its blockchain rather than its use as a digital currency.
While resembling a social stream – more of a “frontpage for the blockchain” according to Lands – Blockai is a single application that seeks to merge a traditional Internet browser with a publishing tool. Using Blockai, users can read and comment on messages embedded into bitcoin blockchain metadata and also write and share their own creations.
The end result, according to Lands, is that Blockai will help people find the blockchain, while allowing them to easily visualize its capabilities beyond bitcoin as a currency.
Lands explained:
“If you're trying to figure out what is the blockchain and how to use it, you're going to need to be able to interact with different applications on there with a single place, versus having to go out and search how to use this protocol.”
To start, users will be able to post permanent messages, sign and timestamp documents and declare their love on the blockchain using Blockai's tools. Once users create an account they select a username and add a profile photo, before adding funds to their wallet address.
Perhaps most critically, it also includes a social sharing button and ‘love button' that enables content creators to reward each other with tweets and micropayments.
Lands went on to describe the project as one that could become a “trojan horse for bitcoin”, solving issues that led to difficulties with his first venture.
“QuickCoin was amazing at getting bitcoin to people, but then there was nothing, it would die right there. You have to do something that's a lot more meaningful,” Lands said.
Building Blockai
On a technical level, Blockai is a fully functioning bitcoin web wallet that is also used for reading and interpreting confirmed bitcoin blocks. This means that what users see on its colorful screen is a stream of the bitcoin network's metadata.
Blockai's wallet software then runs in the browser and posts via a third-party blockchain API. Transactions are scanned and confirmed by its servers.
“Everything you read or write on Blockai are full on-chain bitcoin transactions and we hold no privileged position. Anyone could create their own software that reads and writes the same data,” explained Blockai CTO William Cotton.
To use the service, users send bitcoin to their Blockai wallet at no cost, although the price for sending messages and time-stamping documents is set at a price of 10 bits (around $0.002).
As for how much control users have over the wallet, Cotton indicated it is now not possible for users to import or export private keys to another application, though he said such functionality could be added this year.
“We'd rather not give our users the option to import keys until we're assured that we've got a secure solution in place,” Cotton added.
Visualizing the blockchain
Lands is keen to position Blockai as a Netscape-type breakthrough, referring to the pioneering browser that is credited with helping the world discover the potential of the Internet.
“We want to show the world how to use the blockchain,” Lands said of the beta version of Blockai. “Obviously it's a browser in terms of we're digitizing the blockchain as a stream.”
Over time, Lands sees Blockai evolving into more of an app store, allowing users to potentially discover other bitcoin applications and more easily understand how they are used with the help of a visual aid.
“If your idea is you want to submit a document, maybe that's how you're going to use it. But different people are going to use it in different ways, the same way people are going to use the iPhone in different ways for different applications that are relevant to them,” Lands added.
The Blockai team intend to keep their approach to the project open, and while they have ideas for new applications, Lands indicated they would be keen to respond to user feedback so that the service could evolve organically.
Big ideas
Throughout the interview, Lands stressed that Blockai is only in beta, meaning that the initial set of capabilities it enables are more novelties, examples of how the service could evolve, and thus not indicative of its potential usefulness.
For example, Lands noted his background at gamification startup Gamify, as well as Cotton's prior experience in the music industry as factors that would influence how Blockai intends to diversify in the coming months.
[post-quote]
Regardless of the service, however, the intent is that Blockai enables content creators to use the blockchain as a means of publishing, so that the viral growth that propels social platforms can bring added attention to the blockchain.
“We don't have a lot of viral features in there yet, but obviously it's going to be improved,” Lands said, arguing that, whatever the service adds, these tools will at least appeal to users who may not have been persuaded to investigate bitcoin as a currency.
“I really think that not everyone is going to get into bitcoin because of speculation,” he explained. “You can send bitcoin to someone with no purpose, but I think those things are going to result in bitcoin spreading at an OK rate, versus if you try to give people interesting things to do with bitcoin and then invite them to spread it.”
‘Drop in the pond'
Given that Blockai is seeking to take advantage of bitcoin's metadata, however, the service is likely to stir up debate regarding whether the blockchain should be used principally for financial use cases.
For instance, critics have long argued that non-financial uses ‘bloat' or spam the blockchain with unnecessary transactions. However, Cotton and Lands don't see their service as one that will be problematic for the network as a whole.
“We're currently not doing anything to prevent either spam or bloat, as neither have really become an issue just yet,” Cotton said. “There are only around 17,400 total transactions with OP_RETURN data. These transactions account for around 700kb of data embedded in 16mb of transactions. This is a drop in the pond compared to the rest of the blockchain.”
Nonetheless, they acknowledged their methods might be controversial, adding that they'll be “actively monitoring” the effects of their service on the blockchain when such issues “become more than just speculation”.
Of course, given that Blockai is making metadata visible in the blockchain, there arises concerns about whether bitcoin users would be unknowingly making certain materials discoverable to the tool's users.
Lands said that while, in theory, users could have the option to hide metadata transactions from Blockai, such a capability is not yet on the horizon for the product. First, the project will look to implement filtering features for users, so they can uncover more relevant information on the blockchain.
“They'll start off with simple filters, which we'll be implementing pretty soon,” Lands said. He added that, as with Internet browsers before it: “Over time we'll want to give you better ways to see more relevant data.”

Bitcoin Startups Believe Africa Is Fertile Ground for Crypto-Solutions
Bitcoin is growing in popularity in Africa particularly in regions such as Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana. This week the Hong Kong-based Bitspark has launched a remittance service to Nigeria at rates 14.4 percent better than competitors, by leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Bitcoin network.

Bitspark Offers Cheaper Remittances by Leveraging the Bitcoin Blockchain
The startup Bitspark is a cryptocurrency-financial services provider servicing the Asia-Pacific region and now countries located in Africa. The company has created an end to end remittance service powered by the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitspark says they will focus on Nigeria first as the country has the largest population and economy within the African continent. According to statistics, Nigeria has received an annual US$21 billion in remittances from countries across the globe.
Bitspark details that its newly launched Nigerian payment service will save people transaction costs as the company believes it is far cheaper than remittance competitors.
“For every one dollar you send to Nigeria you'll receive $0.14 more than if you use a competitor's offer which at the end of the day can work out to be hundreds of dollars to the average transaction,” explains Bitspark.
This is made possible by using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the payment method without the need for banks. This is a great benefit to the end user receiving the money and Nigeria as a whole ensuring more money makes its way into the hands of the people which in turns helps develop the rapidly growing economic prospects of the nation.
Significant Interest Stems from South African Countries
South African countries are embracing bitcoin as Google Trends points out significant interest is arising from Nigeria and Ghana. Furthermore, according to a research report from the wallet provider Luno, concerning South Africa, bitcoin is attractive to citizens within the country. Luno's report also details that 66 percent of South Africans surveyed say they trust bitcoin. 12.9 percent of responses say South Africans are using it for faster payments but 39.6 percent of those surveyed are holding bitcoins as an investment vehicle.
Other Bitcoin-Based Payment Service Startups Are Targeting the African Continent
Just recently the payment platform startup Bitwala announced a new service offering bitcoin-to-M-Pesa transactions at zero cost. Bitwala customers will be able to utilize the service to send funds to friends and family members in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania free of charge.
Other companies focused on bitcoin remittance applications in Africa are also making headway in the region. Last month the African payment services provider Bitpesa partnered with the bitcoin-based lending platform Bitbond. In order to make cross-border lending possible both companies utilize the bitcoin blockchain for faster, more efficient payment processing.
“This means that a small business owner from Kenya can receive loan funding from investors from all over the world via Bitbond and have the funds paid out to his mobile money account in 20 minutes,” explains the founder of Bitbond Radoslav Albrecht. “This is an unprecedented level of innovation and convenience in the entire online lending space.”
Bitcoin-centric businesses are focusing in on Africa, and the South African region as cryptocurrency interest is growing fast.

Accused International crime-kingpin Alexander Surin's new nickname is "Don Car-leone" after his arrest included the seizure of millions of dollars in exotic cars. That nickname's different than his secret forum screenname we found flaunting his automotive collecting prowess. UPDATE.
Surin was arrested by Spanish authorities and extradited to France in September, leading authorities to seize the following vehicles from Switzerland and the United Kingdom. These vehicles represent what they now believe is only part of his amazing collection:
Bugatti Veyron (x2): $1,680,000 ($3,360,000)
Enzo Ferrari (x2): $613,000 ($1,226,000)
Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé: $491,000
Rolls-Royce Phantom: $421,500
Ferrari 599 GTB: $318,000
Ferrari California: $220,000
Porsche 911 GT3: $125,000

The collection inspired one Interpol source to tell The Sun:"It's absolutely incredible. Never mind the Godfather's Don Corleone - he is Don Car-leone."
One would expect a lifestyle like Alexander Surin's to stand out. But despite jet-setting around Europe for his "business," which, according to European police, most certainly included organized crime and drug-running, and amassing a collection of some of the most expensive exotic cars in the world, Surin supposedly lived a very quiet public life. Police claim he drove a "humble banger" around England rather than one of his fleet of exotic cars and never flaunted his amazing ill-gotten wealth.
Advertisement
That's because Surin kept his love of exotic cars hidden from the real world. Instead he chose to freely flaunt it in the digital world.
In 2006, Surin created an anonymous account on the Ferrari Chat (membership required) forum, a semi-exclusive online automotive lounge for owners and lovers of the famed Italian marque. It was there where he posted under the name "Icemanbops," a hilarious screen name given "iceman" is a slang term for a cocaine dealer. The "Bops" part is because this Alexander Surin may be Michael Boparan, a trader busted in a major customs sting in 2003 whose conviction was overturned due to a mistake on the part of the prosecution. He previously served time for masterminding an extensive identity theft ring in 1995.

There are accounts under the same name on the Pistonheads forum and on Benzworld, where he talks about his SLR Roadster and refers to himself as a "Pharma Manufacturer."
Considering the secrecy with which he lived his life — police say he stashed more than $1.1 million in cash in the cars they found — the details he shared online — photos, and information about his Ferraris and about future Ferrari products — is astonishing.
Advertisement
It's clear in the many posts we examined on FerrariChat that Surin was seeking praise for his generosity (buying cars for his brother and wife) and also the acknowledgment of his amazing collection he couldn't get in the real world.
Most of the other forum members gave Surin platitudes:
"Congrats!! I enjoy all of your threads. Please continue to post photos of your great collection. Most of us could only dream of living the great life that you are. :)"
Advertisement
What a life indeed.
in hindsight, some of the comments Surin posted on the forum are extremely appropriate, including an acknowledgment of the best way to do business with a dealer:
In Europe its really a matter of getting to know your local dealer and getting a order placed. They will always take an order with deposit, its just a matter of then opening up a dialogue to ensure you get yours as quickly as possible and then not flipping it. Once you have one on ordered and delivered the next one is much easier.

He was also incredibly well-connected with the Ferrari establishment, sharing information about the Ferrari 599 GTO, which debuted this last week in China, way back in February 2009:
Just to let you know that Ferrari will be building a 599 GTO, it will be a strictly limited edition car, offered to invited known Ferrari owners. Will let you know as I have more details, car will be available end of this year.
Advertisement
Other than the timing he was completely right.
Not everyone took to "Icemanbops," who went by the name "Mike" (possibly in reference to his real name) in private conversations, mostly because there were few who believed someone could own all these cars. At one point another member calls BS on Surin's request for help in locating an Enzo, not realizing who he was dealing with.
An offended Surin responds:
No Doubt you have seen or heard it all before. I am not here to waste anyones time, I have subscribed to this forum and simply requested help from people who have a genuine interest and regard for this marque. I could buy the first and probably most expensive car offered, wouldn't make sense as its not how I run my life or my businesses. I also enjoy the hunt. (emphasis added)

No one seems to ask what his business is, and he never tells. When someone presses him later to prove after he buys the Enzo its his he says he'll do whatever it takes to prove the car is his except pose for a picture with it. "I will answer every question and pander to all requests for pics (of the car that is)!" His brother, however, he was okay with showing in pictures.
He also apparently was willing to give a ride to a member of the Detailingworld forum (where he may have used the name Tbops) in exchange for a wash-and-wax with the $2,200 Vintage Glaze car treatment. From this we've got video of the car driving around and, possibly, a bit of the alleged kingpin's voice.

Surin drops off the forums after April 2008 but returns in October to crow about the new Enzo (his second) he'd purchased. Once again he's faced with skepticism from people unaware of the type of person is on the other end of the message board. Calmly and coolly he withdraws from the forum:
Gentlemen I take offense in having my integrity questioned. It has been in this thread and also in the 5 yr old Lebanon Enzo thread. I am withdrawing from F-chat as an active participant, it should be a forum that shares and involves and invokes enthusiasts of this very special marque. I have given a number of inside lines as to new cars coming into production and many insights into cars I own. However I am getting tired of defending myself, I shall just enjoy the cars I have and the many on order. Not being too sensitive at all, just tired of it. Will just smash about in the cars from now on and keep my opinions to myself and live the dream. If you ever see me , hoot or pull up and have a chat. Take it easy Bye guys. Mike.
He did return, once again, to talk about his displeasure with his Ferrari California ("Even my wife won't drive it") and to share the news of his Bugatti purchases. His last post was in August 2009 and concerned with who might be the first to buy a Ferrari 458 Italia. That wasn't the last time he'd hit the FerrariChat forum. According to his profile, he last signed on March 13th at 5:46 am. He made no posting since and now has deleted his profile. Was he on the run from the cops? Did he know he was being hunted?
This is rumored to be video of Surin/Boparan himself getting out of one of his Ferrari Enzos.

A spokesperson for the SOCA (Serious Organized Crime Agency) of the British Government confirmed to Jalopnik they've "Frozen a number of properties and high-value cars as part of an ongoing civil recovery investigation." Given what's on the FerrariChat forum it's clear there's more out there.
A June study found that the number of people worldwide with more than $1 million to invest soared to a record 12 million in 2012, a 9.2 percent increase over the previous year. The number of ultra rich -- the 111,000 people with investable assets of at least $30 million -- surged 11 percent.
The Stanleys and the Neumanns, meanwhile, are falling behind. Whatever your politics, please watch this film. These two families, one black and one white, put a human face on the polarized debate about what is happening to the American middle class.
Conservative viewers may feel that the two couples made mistakes -- failing to go to college, for example, or not moving out of a dying industrial town like Milwaukee. Liberal viewers may see them as victims of a globalized economy that rewards the few spectacularly and relegates the many to low-paying jobs.
Whatever the cause, their spiral is startling.
When filmmakers Bill Moyers, Kathleen Hughes and Tom Casciato, first visited them in 1991, the family's wages from union factory work comfortably supported them. In the early 1990s, however, as Milwaukee factories moved overseas, both of the Stanleys, and Tony Neumann, the Neumann patriarch, lost their jobs. They took lower-paying work and, to makes ends meet, Tony Neumann's wife, Terry, also had to enter the workforce.
Throughout the 2000s, the couples struggled on. Claude Stanley, the Stanley patriarch, waterproofed basements, started his own home inspection business and became a minister. By 2012, an illness has saddled him with enormous medical bills and his business had failed. At 59, he was a city forestry department worker making $26,000 a year trimming trees and collecting garbage. His wife Jackie became a realtor, but never gained a foothold in a declining housing market. Only one of their five children finished college, paying tuition with credit cards.
After his layoff, Tony Neumann took a low-paying overnight factory job, and rarely saw his wife and three children. His wife Terry worked as a security guard, forklift operator and home healthcare attendant. By 2012, the couple, high school sweethearts, had divorced and lost their home through foreclosure.
The children in both families fared even worse. Those who attended at least some college had steady work. Those who did not have low-paying jobs or no work at all.
Many also had failed relationships. As of 2012, one Neumann son was a high school dropout who had fathered two children with two different women. The other was unemployed and had fathered three children with two different women. Defying stereotypes, the Stanleys, who are black, proved to be a more stable family than the Neumanns.
In one of the film's most wrenching scenes, Terry Neumann visits the house she lost to foreclosure, where she had expected to live out her American dream. The family that bought it at auction for $38,000 looks on as she tours the home, wondering what went wrong.

The Public Health Agency of Canada has issued advice for travellers on the Zika virus , recommending that Canadians practice special health precautions while travelling in affected countries. Pregnant women and those considering becoming pregnant should avoid travel to Venezuela. See Health for more information.
Avoid all travel to Venezuela due to the significant level of violent crime, the unstable political and economic situations and the decline in basic living conditions, including shortages of medication, food staples, gasoline and water.
Safety and security
Safety and security
The security situation in Venezuela remains unstable and could deteriorate with very little warning. A nationwide state of exception (state of emergency) has been in effect since January 15, 2016.
If you decide to travel to Venezuela despite this advisory, seek help from a reputable tour company, family or friend who has a good understanding of the current situation. Stay in accommodations with good security.
Crime
Violent crime
Venezuela has one of the world's highest homicide rates.
Murder and other violent crimes are pervasive throughout the country. Crimes include:
Armed robbery, particularly in the capital city of Caracas
Home invasion
Carjacking
Kidnapping for ransom
Violence against locals and visitors alike can occur in both urban and rural areas, including in those popular with tourists.
Organized criminal groups and gangs are rampant. Many criminals carry firearms, and victims are often injured or killed for failing to cooperate.
If you are threatened, stay calm and don't resist
Don't walk on city streets at night, and avoid walking alone in less busy or isolated areas during the day
Don't visit “barrios” (heavily populated slums), especially in eastern and western areas of Caracas but also in any part of the country, as barrios are extremely unsafe
Petty crime
Street crime is common, particularly in major cities, and often results in violence. Pickpockets are active in crowded bus and subway stations.
Criminals have targeted pedestrians and motorists, sometimes from motorcycles.
Authorities (e.g. police, airport, immigration) have harassed and extorted money from travellers. If you experience such problems, report the incident to the Canadian embassy in Caracas.
Police response times are poor or non-existent in most parts of the country, and most reported crimes don't result in prosecution.
Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times
Don't show signs of affluence or display valuables, particularly jewelry and electronics, including cell phones
Avoid carrying large sums of cash and keep foreign currency out of sight
Maintain a low profile and remain aware of your surroundings at all times.
International border regions
The borders with Brazil and Colombia are closed until further notice. The maritime borders with Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire are also closed. Flights to and from those islands are suspended until further notice.
Armed criminal groups frequently operate on both sides of the border with Colombia, conducting illegal activities such as:
Smuggling
Drug trafficking
Black market sales
There is a high military presence in a number of municipalities located along the border. Nevertheless, general lawlessness, particularly in the area within 20 km of the border with Colombia, increases the risk of extortion and kidnapping in this region. The situation is less prevalent in La Fría (state of Táchira) and Puerto Ayacucho (state of Amazonas) and on main highways.
Smuggling and drug trafficking also occur along the borders with Brazil and Guyana.
Stay informed of the security situation, as well as which border crossings are open, and their hours of opening.
At the airport
Simón Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía (Caracas) is dangerous. Incidents of violent crime occur frequently, both inside the facilities and in the surrounding areas.
Kidnappers and armed robbers have targeted foreigners, who are assumed to be holding large amounts of foreign currency. Criminals often approach tourists at the airport and offer to exchange money. They may also pose as taxi drivers.
Arrange your travel so that you arrive and depart the airport during daylight hours
Have a friend, family member or a trusted transportation service waiting to pick you up upon arrival
Don't take a taxi from this airport
On the road
Incidents of crime along intercity roads are common. Armed bandits set up illegal roadblocks and rob vehicles, including intercity buses.
There have been incidents of motorists being robbed after stopping to assess the damage to their vehicle from improvised spikes on the road or stone throwing from highway overpasses and bridges near poorer neighbourhoods.
Keep your valuables out of plain sight
Remain vigilant when driving, especially when stopped
Always drive with the doors locked and windows closed
Avoid driving after dark
Kidnapping
Express kidnappings are frequent and can occur anywhere in the country. Victims are usually kidnapped from the street and forced to withdraw funds from an ATM.
Be careful when dealing with recent acquaintances, especially when they offer rides
Use ATMs located in secure locations during daylight hours only
Don't use ATMs at the airport
Be extremely cautious after having exchanged or withdrawn money
Be discrete when handling money in public
Demonstrations and social unrest
Large-scale and violent demonstrations frequently occur in Caracas and many other areas across the country. They have resulted in many arrests, including of foreign reporters, injuries and deaths in the past.
Demonstrations can take many forms, including:
large-scale gatherings
marches
national strikes
roadblocks, including on major highways
Demonstrations can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.
Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
Don't attempt to cross road blockades, even if they appear unattended
Don't participate in political discussions or activities in public, or appear to take sides on any local issue related to the current political situation
Don't photograph sensitive installations, including the presidential palace, military sites, government buildings and airports
Follow the instructions of local authorities
Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
More about mass gatherings (large-scale events)
Shortages
There are severe shortages of basic food items and necessities, including medicine and personal-care products. They have led to long line-ups at grocery stores and pharmacies across the country. Rioting, fighting and theft occur in line-ups.
Municipal water and power shortages occur in parts of the country, including in Caracas, even during the rainy season.
Fuel may also be scarce outside of cities.
Ensure that your emergency kit is complete.
Emergency kit
Communications
Telecommunication infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. Interruptions are frequent. It is very difficult to make international calls.
Some areas don't have cellular coverage. Check local providers' coverage.
Piracy
There have been incidents of piracy against ships in coastal areas and marinas, some involving a high degree of violence, including murder. Be aware of the risk of attack and take appropriate precautions if you own a small vessel.
Live Piracy Report - International Maritime Bureau
Spiked food and drinks
Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
Adventure tourism
If you intend on undertaking excursions or recreational activities:
never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
ensure that businesses offering excursions follow proper safety measures
buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
ensure that you're properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp
Water activities
Rescue services and aquatic equipment may not be consistent with international standards.
Ensure that equipment is safe and in good condition
Ensure that helmets and life jackets are available
Check that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities
Water safety abroad
Road safety
Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Unmarked road damage or construction also poses a hazard. After heavy rains, sewer grates may have been displaced and potholes may be hidden in puddles. Street lighting is often inadequate.
Drivers do not respect traffic laws. They are extremely aggressive and reckless. They often don't stop at red lights or stop signs, and some don't turn on their vehicle lights. Drinking and driving is prevalent.
Outside of cities, gas stations and restaurants can be few and far between, and gas pumps are often empty.
Crime increases at nightfall. Therefore, driving at night is risky.
Public transportation
There is a high risk of theft on both inner city and intercity buses, especially at night. There is a risk of theft in the subway, and some subway stations are unsafe.
Only take the subway during daylight hours, and avoid peak hours
Seek advice from locals before using this means of transportation
Taxis
Licensed taxis are generally safer than unlicensed taxis. Mototaxis are not recommended as drivers can be reckless.
Pre-book a licensed, radio-dispatched taxi
Avoid hailing a taxi in the street
Advise a friend of your movements, the taxi company's name and the taxi number
Air travel
We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.
General information about foreign domestic airlines
Travelling within or out of the country on short notice can be difficult. International and domestic commercial flights are limited. Some international airlines have reduced the number of flights arriving to and departing from Venezuela or have suspended services altogether.
CTV Winnipeg
A 14-year-old boy was rushed to hospital after being accidentally stabbed in class Monday afternoon.
Police said the incident happened around 2:20 p.m., during a woodworking shop class at Westdale Junior High.
The superintendent of Pembina Trails School Division confirmed the school, located on Betsworth Avenue in Charleswood, was locked down following the stabbing.
Monday evening, Winnipeg police tweeted the boy, who was in stable condition, had been released from hospital with minor injuries.
Earlier in the day, officers told CTV a 14-year-old boy was taken into custody in connection to the event.
Police have ruled the stabbing was not criminal in nature, but a poor choice involving horseplay. They say the two boys were close friends.
Police reported that during the class, the boys were given instructions to complete an assignment using an ‘exacto' knife. At some point, one boy flipped the knife in the direction of the victim, striking him in the upper body.
Staff members immediately administered first aid to the victim, while the suspect was taken to another area within the school and held for police.
No charges are being pursued at this time.
At its highest function, the Atlanta BeltLine can encourage development and job growth, connectivity to new and existing job centers, and stability for neighborhoods cut by the lingering effects of the recession. With the Westside Trail, we are committed to preserving and uplifting the historic neighborhoods of southwest Atlanta, such as Adair Park, Capitol View, Oakland City, Mozely Park, West End, and Westview.
A New Type of Development
Unlike the Eastside Trail, the neighborhoods adjacent to the Westside Trail consist of mostly single-family houses. Economic development on the Westside Trail will be encouraged in a few key nodes, most notably Murphy Crossing.
The Westside Trail will potentially become a major economic catalyst, providing support to existing businesses, growth to new businesses, jobs, and connectivity to job centers.
See What's Happening Now
Urban Agriculture
Aluma Farm at Adair Park is the Atlanta BeltLine's first agriculture site around the 22-mile corridor. The farm is privately operated, and produce is sold locally. The site serves as the Atlanta BeltLine's pilot for an urban agriculture program that could serve as a model for other potential sites around the corridor. Learn more
Murphy Crossing
The “Murphy Crossing” site, as it is known, is comprised of parcels that once held the State Farmers Market, adjacent to the Westside Trail between Murphy Avenue and Allene Avenue in southwest Atlanta.
With the release of this request for proposals, ABI will engage a consultant to craft an analysis and set of recommendations focused on activating the Murphy Crossing site and adjacent neighborhoods. Analysis will consider the potential redevelopment of existing buildings, inclusion of workforce housing, and scenarios to encourage job growth. The 16-acre site is a prime economic development node for its proximity to MARTA rail lines, the Westside Trail and future Atlanta Streetcar transit, the Atlanta University Center, the Allene Avenue Urban Farm site, and the historical Adair Park, West End, Washington Park, and Westview neighborhoods.
Enota Park
In October, Atlanta BeltLine requested proposals for the design of the Enota Park expansion on the Westside Trail. The expanded park will be over 8-acres and will include elements such as active recreation fields, sidewalks and walking trails, access to the Westside Trail, public art, benches and seating, signage and wayfinding, and more. More info will be available as the design process advances.
Friday's Last Word: Docker CEO Ben Golub sat down with Talkin' Cloud to help us understand who he is away from the office. Here are the details.
Friday's Last Word: Docker CEO Ben Golub — Who is he?
Docker CEO Ben Golub has been leading the San Francisco-based open source platform provider since joining the company in April 2013. Most recently, he oversaw Docker's Series C venture capital financing round of $40 million. The company plans to use the capital to drive the adoption of its platform in the enterprise and broaden its ecosystem of application developers, system administrators, platform providers and technology partners.
Before joining Docker, Golub was the president and CEO of Gluster, an open source platform acquired by Red Hat in October 2011. He also served as president of Comcast's Plaxo Division. He'd worked with Plaxo for five years before it was acquired by Comcast in May 2008. He also worked with Verisign, an authentication services company that was bought by Symantec.
What does Golub have planned for Docker in 2014?
Golub expects to continue the company's momentum, “particularly coming off of this week's funding announcement.” He plans to grow the Docker community and ecosystem, and drive adoption of Docker's open source platform within enterprises.
Who does Golub challenge to sit in Friday's Last Word's hot seat?
Rob Bearden, CEO of Hortonworks, a Palo Alto, California-based software company focused on the development and support of Apache Hadoop. Up for the challenge, Bearden? Have your people reach out to our people — and we'll talk.

SAN ANTONIO - The fight to help our nation's heroes get off the streets has gotten a big push in the Alamo City with a $2.1 million donation from United Services Automobile Association to the citywide initiative to house homeless veterans.
San Antonio joined a national initiative last January to lower veteran homelessness, dropping the number of homeless veterans from 800 to around 300. The goal now is to house those last 300 by March 21.
"Those are the folks who have issues that have been a little more difficult to address," Mayor Ivy Taylor said.
The veterans are often chronically homeless and many are dealing with substance abuse or legal issues. The new funding will further a program in which formerly homeless vets help counsel currently homeless peers into housing.
"They've been living under a bridge for 7, 8, 9, 10 years. You cannot just fix that right away. You've got to establish some relationships you have to have resources ready," said Travis Pearson, CEO of Family Endeavors, which helps battle homelessness.
Family Endeavors will use some of the money to target newly homeless veterans to prevent them from chronic homelessness. Pearson said that will be possible by improving a "real time" database that's already been established.
"We can plug in a veteran and their various needs or barriers and then immediately we'll know of all the agencies across San Antonio, who has a bed, who has this service and we can get them connected right away," he said.
The challenge will accomplish the goal by the deadline that the agencies set for themselves. Pearson and Taylor both said the goal is attainable.
Taylor encouraged other businesses, faith-based organizations and community members to donate to the cause. She said continued funds will help keep veterans from returning to the streets.
Texas Veteran Statistics
Homeless veteran shares experience
The city's been working on this goal of housing all veterans here.
Will Rogers was one of the homeless vets, even though he had a job.
“I've been in and out of homelessness for some time, for a good 10 years, but I never considered it," said Rogers. "I never thought myself as being homeless because I was what they call sofa surfing, sleeping on someone else's sofa, staying with a family member, so I always had someone there to assist me so I never really hit rock bottom. But I was dependent upon someone else's resources instead my own.”
Overall homelessness issue addressed by veteran homelessness
Now he's an advocate for other veterans to get into programs like Family Endeavors. Bobby Ehrig, a former veteran himself and a program manager at Family Endeavors, said that by addressing homelessness within the veteran community, homeless overall will be given a lot more focus.
“Approximately 18 to 20 percent of the population that is currently homeless on any given day in our county is actually a veteran of the community who has served his country and I think that just by tackling that specific demographic, that we can help reduce homelessness overall because other than freeing up resources and funding for other people or other needs, it also allows the veterans that we service, much like Will, to become another part of society helping to give back to others.”
Can it be done?
Many people ask how all veterans can be housed. Program leaders say they believe it's possible. But there's a term called functional zero. That means the programs target vets that want to be helped.
“In terms of functional zero is that we have a plan in mind and that we have the resources in the community to help that individual when he or she does become homeless," said Ignacio Leija is with the American GI Forum in San Antonio. On a daily or a weekly basis, we work with other providers… as these individuals show up on our lists, then it's up to us and other providers in the community to work with them and to give them the wherewithal, the resources they need to get into housing and a job situation if possible so they will be able to sustain themselves.”
The partnership with USAA, the city and programs around San Antonio aims to eliminate veteran homelessness.

A lot of people in higher ed are wondering how the Trump administration and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos might change the federal rules around campus sexual-assault investigations and adjudications (disclosure).
In her confirmation hearing, DeVos said it would be “premature” to pledge that she would retain the infamous 2011 “guidance” that imposed the “more likely than not” evidence standard and strongly discouraged cross-examination, among other changes.
She also met with a leading critic of the Office for Civil Rights' “Dear Colleague” letter, Republican Sen. James Lankford, who chairs a subcommittee that oversees federal regulation.
And yet others are wondering why the sweeping mandates from the department – which threatened to revoke colleges' federal funding if they didn't comply in full – aren't being imposed on American society as a whole.
The Chronicle of Higher Education has a feature on how the guidance has upended college practices for nearly six years, and the confusion that preceded it, but it saves the most eye-opening passage until the end:
In fact, some argue that the Obama administration's admonitions to campuses should have applied more broadly. Peter F. Lake, director of the Center for Higher Education Law and Policy at the Stetson University College of Law, says higher education must do more to expand Title IX outside its own walls — particularly if it wants support for how it deals with reports of assault. The same protections that now exist for college students, he says, should be extended to all Americans. “It's hard to make the argument to the American people broadly that we should be so obsessed with Title IX on college campuses when so many millions of Americans are affected by sex trafficking, domestic violence, and workplace violence, and we don't appear to be caring about those things,” says Mr. Lake. “If we only care about our own bubble and the only people who get access to our help are those inside the fortress wall, it rings pretty hollow.”
Lake has previously said that the Title IX consulting industry should look for other business opportunities under Trump administration higher-ed directives.
But it sounds like he's suggesting just the opposite here: There's a killing to be made by importing the Title IX industrial complex into homes, businesses and the legal system.
How a 20-page letter changed the way higher education handles sexual assault: https://t.co/8a74QP1Ahr — Chronicle (@chronicle) February 8, 2017
This work is already underway at the American Law Institute, which tried to quietly redefine “sexual assault” in a “model penal code” to match its definition on many campuses, as well as in California and New York state laws. Think of courts treating “unwanted touching” over clothes and violations of “affirmative consent” (morning kissing) the same as forcible rape.
There's a counter-effort being led by the Center for Prosecutor Integrity, a due-process group, in the wake of some police departments launching “victim-centered” investigations that mimic campus investigations that favor accusers and tilt against accused students.
Stop Abusive and Violent Environments, a group allied with the center that started its own campaign to “end kangaroo courts,” also just released a report on how Lake's vision is being implemented by the Justice Department.
The feds are promoting policies that directly contradict scientific research showing a “persistent sex bias in the criminal justice system” against men, particularly black men, from sentencing to police treatment, the report says:
In 2015 the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) published a guidance document titled, “Identifying and Preventing Gender Bias in Law Enforcement Response to Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence.”16 The COPS report makes claims that directly contradict the findings of the studies cited above, instead alleging the bias is directed against women … These assertions of bias against come out of “thin air” — the report does not present the findings of a single scientific study that compares police response to requests for help by male and female domestic violence victims.
The same office put 28,000 federal employees through anti-male “implicit bias” training last summer and awarded millions in grants to implement DOJ's guidance on “gender bias” in response to sexual assault and domestic violence:
There is no doubt that members of racial minorities and others have experienced discrimination by the criminal justice system. But the COPS Guidance on Identifying and Preventing Gender Bias and its promotion by means of $9.4 million in grant funding are nothing less than Orwellian. Making claims of bias against women that can be readily refuted only serve to undermine the important efforts to end bias against other groups.
Peter Lake's apparent dream of an America where anyone's life can be ruined for ordinary relationship behavior, deprived of all context, may be closer to reality than we think.

Two officers, both seven-year veterans of the Detroit Police Department assigned to an elite unit, are described as hard workers and have been recognized for identifying people involved in violent crime.
Charles Lynem, 32, and Chancellor Searcy, 29, who were partners with the Tactical Response Unit, were together again Tuesday — this time appearing before a judge on felony charges.
Among the allegations against the officers: they are accused of confiscating money from a 33-year-old Detroit man they arrested in March 2013, and fabricating the “circumstances and documentation” involving the arrest of a 41-year-old man in September 2014.
Lynem and Searcy each face several counts, including misconduct in office, embezzlement less than $20,000, larceny less than $20,000 and false report of a felony.
Both officers, now suspended without pay, appeared Tuesday before 36th District Magistrate Laura Echartea via a video connection. Not guilty pleas were entered during their arraignments in Detroit.
"Whenever an officer is accused of criminal misconduct, certainly it is a dark day for the department," Detroit Police James Craig said at a news conference Tuesday. "I stress that these are allegations."
Searcy has been charged in four cases and Lynem was charged in two cases involving allegations from March 18, 2013, to Sept. 27, 2014. They were given $10,000 personal bonds for each case they were charged in.

Attorney John Goldpaugh is representing the officers and said he wants them to have their day in court and expects them to be vindicated.
“They're both hardworking people that have been out there serving Detroit,” he said. “And serving Detroit well.”
The investigation began almost a year ago when the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office brought information to the police department and police opened an investigation, Craig said.
Police said the two officers were suspended with pay on Oct. 30, 2014, and were suspended without pay Tuesday.
“We always take any allegations of misconduct ... seriously,” Craig said.
The charging decision was made Monday and Searcy and Lynem voluntarily turned themselves in at 4 a.m. Tuesday, Craig said.

"We work for the people, and the people hold us accountable to enforce the law constitutionally," he said while addressing reporters about the case.
Craig said the vast majority of Detroit police officers serve the community with distinction and honor.
According to a news release from the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, Searcy and Lynem arrested a man at a gas station in the 10600 block of Outer Drive in Detroit the night of March 18, 2013, and confiscated money from him. According to court records, the man was charged with drug and weapons counts and later pleaded guilty to carrying a concealed weapon. The other charges were dismissed.
“It is alleged that there was a wrongful conduct surrounding the detention, frisk, seizure of property and the arrest of the suspect,” the release said.
In a separate incident, both men are also accused of fabricating "the circumstances and documentation” surrounding the arrest of a man accused of carrying a concealed weapon. Those allegations stem from the night of Sept. 27, 2014, in the 8000 block of West Grand Boulevard, prosecutors said.
“The case was subsequently dismissed because of the alleged fabricated circumstances and documentation issues in the case,” Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, said in an email.
Searcy faces charges in two other cases, including an incident on Aug. 4, 2014, where he is accused of stopping a 28-year-old man in the 4000 block of Webb and taking money from him. During another incident on Aug. 10, 2014, Searcy is again accused of taking money from a man. Both of the men made formal complaints, prosecutors said.
Mark Diaz, president of the Detroit Police Officers Association, called the allegations “the most unfortunate thing we can imagine,” but he predicted the officers ultimately would prevail against the accusations.
“These are two solid police officers with one goal, and that is to protect our citizens,” Diaz said. “I'm incredibly confident that at the end of this, these two officers will be exonerated.”
Diaz described the officers as the hard-charging type who were exceptional at getting armed criminals and drug dealers off the street. He said it's not unusual for suspects to allege that police planted evidence or stole from them, in an attempt to deflect blame for arrests.
Lynem received a "TOP COPS" award last year in Washington, D.C., with an honorable mention as part of the National Association of Police Organizations program. He was the only officer in Michigan to be recognized by the program in 2014.
Their next court dates are Nov. 3 for a probable cause conference and Nov. 15 for a preliminary examination.

The Disney World Minute is here! In this video series, I'll share Disney World tips, tricks, and trivia, all in about a minute or less. For this video, I'm giving you the best places to sit on the most popular Disney World rides. Think all seats were created equal? Think again. From the mountains of the Magic Kingdom to the thrill rides of Sunset Boulevard, here are the best places to sit on WDW's best rides. Read on for more details, and to find out a really simple tip in order to get these coveted seats. And be sure to subscribe to the Guide2WDW YouTube Channel for more Disney World and Disneyland videos each week.
Here are a few more details and a couple bonus suggestions that I couldn't fit in the video.

Magic Kingdom
Seven Dwarfs Mine Train: There are two good options for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. The front row feels the slowest, but gives the best views of Fantasyland. Also, the timing of the dark ride mine scene seems to work best for the front row, and front row riders get the most time to look at the surprise cameo at the end of the ride. The back row feels the fastest, so Seven Dwarfs Mine Train's mild thrills get kicked up a notch. Either of these rows are the best way to ride Seven Dwarfs Mine Train.
Splash Mountain: In terms of ride intensity, pretty much every spot in the log feels the same. However, dryness is another story. If you want to stay as dry as possible on Splash Mountain, sit in the back left of the log. The front of the log will absorb most of the water from the big splash down, and you'll avoid the extra water from the waterfalls and water effects that tend to hit the right-hand side of the vehicle. Want the best view of the drop? Sit in the front row.
Space Mountain: I haven't noticed much difference of ride intensity from the back seat to the front seat, but there is a big difference in immersion. Since there are no people sitting directly in front of you, the front most seat is the darkest, most surprising ride.
Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: Want the wildest ride in the wilderness? Sit in the back row. It is considerably faster on the drops than the front row, making it a much more intense experience. For a bonus sense of speed, ride it at night. Through a completely scientific process, I've determined that Big Thunder goes faster at night (aka I've ridden it a bunch and it feels faster and scarier in the dark to me, even if the speed is probably the same. #science).
Epcot
Soarin: Currently, this is the only attraction at Epcot where your seat selection can make a big difference on your ride experience. Be sure to sit in the middle section (section #2) on the top row. If you're on the top row, you'll avoid seeing other people's feet dangling in front of you as you glide across California/The World. Also, the giant Soarin' screen curves at the edges, so the middle section will get the least amount of distortion.
Hollywood Studios
Tower of Terror: The randomized drops feel the same from every part of the elevator. However, I personally love the view I get of the park by sitting in the front row. Those with a fear of heights might feel better sitting in the back (or skipping the ride altogether).
Rock ‘N' Roller Coaster: For me, this ride is all about the front seat. The exhilarating 0-60 mph launch feels the most intense from the front row of the super-stretch limo, and you'll get the best view of the giant neon sights of the indoor coaster.
Star Tours: Have trouble with motion sickness? Try sitting the closest to the middle of the vehicle as possible, around the middle of row 3. Want a more intense ride? Sit in the first or last row, away from the middle.
Animal Kingdom
Expedition Everest: Like Rock ‘N' Roller Coaster, this ride is all about the front seat for me. Thanks to the dual-directional nature of this ride, it provides both the best views (especially at the peak) and the best thrills (especially right after the peak). Wave hi to the yeti as you zip by.
Kilimanjaro Safaris: Nothing beats the window seats on Kilimanjaro Safaris, especially if you're taking pictures. You'll have an unobstructed view of the safari by sitting next to the window. As far as which side, it really depends on the day and which animals are out when you get on the ride. Sometimes I've had great luck with the right hand side, and sometimes I wish I was sitting on the left.
Tip: How to get these seats
So, now that you know which seats are the best, how do you get them? Well, it's as simple as asking. Look for the cast member loading the ride: that's usually the Disney employee right before the ride vehicle that asks you how many people are in your party. Politely ask them if you can ride in your requested seat. i.e. If you're going on Expedition Everest, just ask them for the front row. You may have to wait an extra minute or two (a few of these even have mini-queues for people who have requested the most popular row), but Disney employees will almost always honor your request.
That's it for the best places to sit on Disney World rides. Is there another ride that you have a seat preference for at Disney World? Or do you have a suggestion for next week's Disney World Minute video? Let me know in the comments below!
This is really linked to HotSpot and the default option values (Java HotSpot VM Options) which differ between client and server configuration.
From Chapter 2 of the whitepaper (The Java HotSpot Performance Engine Architecture):
The JDK includes two flavors of the VM -- a client-side offering, and a VM tuned for server applications. These two solutions share the Java HotSpot runtime environment code base, but use different compilers that are suited to the distinctly unique performance characteristics of clients and servers. These differences include the compilation inlining policy and heap defaults. Although the Server and the Client VMs are similar, the Server VM has been specially tuned to maximize peak operating speed. It is intended for executing long-running server applications, which need the fastest possible operating speed more than a fast start-up time or smaller runtime memory footprint. The Client VM compiler serves as an upgrade for both the Classic VM and the just-in-time (JIT) compilers used by previous versions of the JDK. The Client VM offers improved run time performance for applications and applets. The Java HotSpot Client VM has been specially tuned to reduce application start-up time and memory footprint, making it particularly well suited for client environments. In general, the client system is better for GUIs.
So the real difference is also on the compiler level:
The Client VM compiler does not try to execute many of the more complex optimizations performed by the compiler in the Server VM, but in exchange, it requires less time to analyze and compile a piece of code. This means the Client VM can start up faster and requires a smaller memory footprint. The Server VM contains an advanced adaptive compiler that supports many of the same types of optimizations performed by optimizing C++ compilers, as well as some optimizations that cannot be done by traditional compilers, such as aggressive inlining across virtual method invocations. This is a competitive and performance advantage over static compilers. Adaptive optimization technology is very flexible in its approach, and typically outperforms even advanced static analysis and compilation techniques.
Note: The release of jdk6 update 10 (see Update Release Notes:Changes in 1.6.0_10) tried to improve startup time, but for a different reason than the hotspot options, being packaged differently with a much smaller kernel.
G. Demecki points out in the comments that in 64-bit versions of JDK, the -client option is ignored for many years.

A simple coding error in at least 685 apps put millions of smartphone users at risk of having some of their calls and text messages intercepted by hackers, cyber-security firm Appthority warned on Thursday.
Developers mistakenly coded credentials for accessing text messaging, calling and other services provided by Twilio Inc, said Appthority's director of security research, Seth Hardy. Hackers could access those credentials by reviewing the code in the apps, then gain access to data sent over those services, he said.
Affected apps include the AT&T Navigator app pre-installed on many Android phones and more than a dozen GPS navigation apps published by Telenav Inc. Such apps have been installed as many as 180 million times on Android phones and an unknown number of times on Apple's iOS-based devices.
Shares of Twilio slid nearly 7 percent after the Appthority report. Hackers covet Twilio credentials because they are used in a variety of apps that send text messages, process phone calls and handle other services. Hackers could access related data if they log into a developer's Twilio account, Hardy said.
Appthority, cautious not to tip off potential hackers, did not list all the apps that could be vulnerable. Twillio's website says its users include Uber Technologies Inc and Netflix Inc. However, large companies like those typically have security reviews that catch common coding errors like the one Appthority described.
There was no indication that Uber or Netflix were affected by the problem.
The findings highlight new threats posed by the increasing use of third-party services such as Twilio, which says on its website that it powers communications for more than 40,000 businesses worldwide. Developers can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities if they do not properly code or configure such services.
"This isn't just limited to Twilio. It's a common problem across third-party services," Hardy said. "We often notice that if they make a mistake with one service, they will do so with other services as well."
Appthority said it also warned Amazon.com Inc that it had found credentials for at least 902 developer accounts with cloud-service provider Amazon Web Services in a scan of 20,098 different apps.
Those credentials could be used to access app user data stored on Amazon, Hardy said.
A representative with Amazon declined comment.
One problem with third-party services is that developers often use the same account across multiple apps, similar to how consumers might use one email address for a variety of financial services and can have fraud problems at all of them if hackers compromise that single email account.
Appthority found Twilio credentials exposed in a now-defunct version of the AT&T Navigator mapping and GPS app. The AT&T app was a re-branded version of an app originally built by Telenav.
Appthority found that newer versions of the AT&T app appeared to be safe, but data sent over them could still be at risk if the developer of a related app is still using the same Twilio account. It said the same Twilio credentials were found coded in more than a dozen other Telenav apps.
AT&T and Telenav could not immediately be reached for comment.
The mistakes were caused by developers, not Twilio, Hardy said. Twilio's website warns developers that leaving credentials in apps could expose their accounts to hackers.
Twilio spokesman Trak Lord said the company has no evidence that hackers used credentials coded into apps to access customer data but was working with developers to change credentials on affected accounts.
The Twilio vulnerability only affects calls and texts made inside of apps that use its messaging services, including some business apps for recording phone calls such as Wrappup and RingDNA, according to Appthority's report. Wrappup an RingDNA could not immediately be reached for comment.
In a survey of 1,100 apps, Appthority found 685 problem apps that were linked to 85 affected Twilio accounts. That suggests the theft of credentials for one app's Twilio account could pose a security threat to all users of as many as eight other apps.
Twilio's shares closed down 6.8 percent at $25.93. Shares had rallied in pre-market trading after Twilio beat revenue expectations and raised its revenue forecast during an earnings report after the markets closed on Wednesday.

We evaluated the quality and content of fish oil supplements in New Zealand. All encapsulated fish oil supplements marketed in New Zealand were eligible for inclusion. Fatty acid content was measured by gas chromatography. Peroxide values (PV) and anisidine values (AV) were measured, and total oxidation values (Totox) calculated. Only 3 of 32 fish oil supplements contained quantities of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that were equal or higher than labelled content, with most products tested (69%) containing <67%. The vast majority of supplements exceeded recommended levels of oxidation markers. 83% products exceeded the recommended PV levels, 25% exceeded AV thresholds, and 50% exceeded recommended Totox levels. Only 8% met the international recommendations, not exceeding any of these indices. Almost all fish oil supplements available in the New Zealand market contain concentrations of EPA and DHA considerably lower than claimed by labels. Importantly, the majority of supplements tested exceeded the recommended indices of oxidative markers. Surprisingly, best-before date, cost, country of origin, and exclusivity were all poor markers of supplement quality.
news Shadow Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has publicly claimed that Labor's National Broadband Network project could could cost as much as $100 billion to build, despite the company's own estimates showing that it will require around $37 billion of capital injection from the Government and eventually make a return.
The comments were made in an interview on the Sky News television channel over the weekend. “The fundamental problem that we've got with the NBN is not simply that it's costing so much money – I mean that is huge obviously, and that's our biggest complaint – but it's taking so long. At the rate they are going this could take 20 years or more to complete, and it could cost up to $100 billion,” said Turnbull.
When questioned by the presenter where that figure came from, Turnbull replied that it was based on how much it was costing NBN Co per premise to deploy the network. “… of course you have got to remember they have reached now as of end of December passed only 70,000-odd premises out of 12.25 million they are supposed to do over the next eight years,” the Liberal MP said.
However, it is not clear where Turnbull is sourcing the $100 billion figure from, as the MP has recently criticised NBN Co for not releasing cost per premise data with respect to its current network rollout.
It's not the first time a senior member of the Coalition has mentioned a $100 billion figure with respect to the NBN. In October last year, for example, Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey used the exact same figure in an interview with ABC Radio's AM program at the time.
“… we can't trust the numbers that the Government is putting in the budget papers,” Hockey said. “Last year they said there was going to be a $22 billion deficit, it turned out to be a $44 billion deficit. There is not one contractor in Australia that believes the Government is going to roll out its National Broadband Network for $32 billion. Expectations are as high as $60 billion, $70 billion or even $100 billion for the National Broadband Network.”
Similarly, in an article published on his website and on business media outlet Business Spectator, Turnbull wrote on September 6 that he could not provide precise financial figures regarding the difference between the Coalition's rival NBN policy and the Government's existing project:
“I have been careful not to nominate a particular sum of money as the difference between what we would do and Labor's current plan. For a start there is enormous scepticism that the NBN Co project can be completed within the cost and timeframe of their business plan. Several very experienced civil contractors and engineers have said to us recently that they think the actual build cost is likely to be $80 to $100 billion for example.”
Additionally, Turnbull pointed out at the time that telecommunications consultant Cliff Gibson had estimated a similar amount industry newsletter Communications Day in May 2011, saying: “I do know that the two partner organisations that we work with would have put tens of millions of dollars worth of work in to put the bid together and our experience on this exercise, and the costing involved, would lead me to think that the cost of roll- ing out the optic fibre to 93% of the homes around Australia is going to cost between 60-80 billion.”
However, based on current evidence, it currently appears as if both Turnbull and Hockey are incorrect in their claims that the NBN project could end up costing to $100 billion in total.
NBN Co's current corporate plan (PDF) states that NBN Co will require some $37.4 billion in capital expenditure over the next decade to construct its network infrastructure. It will also spend some $23.1 billion in operating expenditure over that period, although that figure is expected to be made up mainly from $26.4 billion in revenues over that period. Ultimately, over the long term (30 years or so), NBN Co is projecting that it will make a return of 7.1 percent on the Government's investment in the infrastructure — meaning that it is currently projected that the construction of the NBN will actually make the Government money on its investment.
Additionally, not all of its funding is expected to come from the Government. NBN Co is currently projecting that it will require about $30 billion worth of government investment over its life, with another $14 billion to be funded through debt arrangements.
NBN Co has already locked in construction contracts for much of the next half-decade in states and territories around Australia, as well as network equipment and other related contracts, giving it significant forward visibility in terms of its costs. In addition, the company has finalised its $11 billion agreement with Telstra and its $900 million deal with Optus, and it is also seeing more Australians take up higher-value NBN plans than it had been estimating, meaning that its revenue estimates may be conservative.
In comparison, the Coalition has consistently declined to provide detailed financial information relating to its own policy, which is currently based on fibre to the node technology, as opposed to the NBN's fibre to the home rollout. Turnbull initially stated in mid-August that the Coalition had a fully-costed policy “ready” to be released, but later rescinded the statement, telling the ABC that the Coalition was not in a position to be able to fully cost its policy before the next Federal Election.
In a statement released last year, Communications Minister Stephen Conroy called on the two Coalition politicians to “stop misleading the Australian public” about the cost of the NBN. “The Government released the 2012-2015 NBN Co Corporate Plan provided by the NBN Co Board on 8 August. That plan stated the capital cost of the NBN will be $37.4 billion,” Conroy said. “Since then both Mr Hockey and Mr Turnbull have claimed that the cost could be as high as $100 billion. This is false and inaccurate.”
“The NBN Co Corporate Plan is informed by the agreement with Telstra and signed construction contracts. The Corporate Plan was prepared by the experienced executives of NBN Co, and was approved by the highly qualified independent NBN Co Board. Mr Hockey's and Mr Turnbull's outrageous claims effectively accuse the NBN Co executive and board of being negligent in their duty.”
“This is a disgraceful slur on NBN Co. They should apologise immediately and stop misleading the Australian public.”
The Opposition has made a number of other inaccurate statements about the NBN over the past few years which have been picked up by various segments of the media. Several months ago, speaking on Channel Ten's Meet the Press program, Nationals Leader Warren Truss made a number of major factually inaccurate statements about the project, as detailed in this article by Delimiter at the time. In addition, Truss had previously made a number of inaccurate statements about the NBN over the past several months.
In June, for example, Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey inaccurately claimed that 4G mobile broadband had the potential to be “far superior” to the fibre technology of the NBN. In mid-May, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott misrepresented the cost of connecting to the NBN, in comments which the Government claimed represented a deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian public on the issue. Turnbull similarly made a number of factually incorrect statements on the NBN throughout March, and in January Abbott got quite a few facts about the NBN wrong in a radio interview.
Conroy himself has from time to time made inaccurate statements about other projects in his portfolio. In February, for example, the Minister appeared to consciously tell a factual inaccuracy with respect to the current implementation status of Labor's controversial Internet filtering project, stating that Telstra and Optus had implemented the mandatory filtering system, when they have only implemented a drastically reduced voluntary version.
opinion/analysis
As I wrote in October:
There's not really much to analyse here. NBN Co and Conroy have provided clear financial estimates for the NBN based on actual contracts which have been signed and actual customer take-up. In comparison, the Coalition has declined to provide the working for its own financial estimates. There just isn't any evidence right now that what Turnbull and Hockey are saying is correct.

The government is purging the Education Worker's Union, by completely rehiring with these criteria that not only look for people who are not going to fight for labor rights, but change the mold of education from the revolutionary model that came out of Mexico's revolutionary period, to a model that creates workers for a neoliberal, globalized economy.
Live from Mexico City, Laura Carlsen reports on teachers' strike in Oaxaca - from the protest's struggle against neoliberal labor and education policy changes that strip worker rights and ignore surging economic inequality, to the state's deadly response to this and other challenges to their economic agenda - and updates us on the political aftermath of the government killing of Honduran activist Berta Cáceres.
Laura spoke to the Real News Network for their segment Nine Killed in Police Crackdown on Oaxaca Teacher's Strike.
Now re-opened after officers discovered the package was not dangerous
Police closed Tower Bridge and evacuated the area for nearly two hours after reports of a 'suspicious package'.
The Metropolitan Police have confirmed officers were at the scene trying to establish what was inside after receiving the report earlier today.
They got the call at 2.38pm and they rushed to the scene, closing the bridge and evacuating shops and offices in the area - one of the busiest and most crucial roads in the capital.
Ghost town: The usually busy bridge was totally deserted after the evacuation earlier today. Twitter
Police emergency vehicles rushed to the scene after the the report at 2.38pm today
Overlooked: London was tweeting as the prominent area in the heart of London was evacuated
Dramatic scenes: The unusually quiet bridge is overlooked by prominent skyscrapers in London that could see just a few vehicles on a bridge that's usually packed from one end to the other
The usually busy bridge looked eerily empty after police set up a cordon and dramatic scenes unfolded with emergency vehicles turning up at the scene.
Delays caused traffic chaos as queues built up either side of the bridge and in the surrounding areas in the run up to rush hour.
Luckily, the road was re-opened at around 4.15pm after officers discovered the package was not dangerous.
However, congestion is expected to remain in the area until the backlog of vehicles clears.
Lammey: Chances the Broncos land Redskins QB Cousins in free agency
After a sixth consecutive loss Sunday at home and the dismissal of offensive coordinator Mike McCoy, it's clear the Denver Broncos have entered full evaluation mode for the rest of the 2017 season.
Quarterback Paxton Lynch, Denver's first-round pick in 2016, should see the starting lineup as the team wants to determine if there's anything to salvage after he failed to win the starting job two years in a row.
“I'm pleased with how I've progressed mentally and physically up until this point,” Lynch said last week. “I'm excited about the opportunity whenever it presents itself.”
But no matter what Lynch shows over the rest of the regular season, the Broncos could look to free agency in 2018 for a starting quarterback.
One quarterback who should be available is current Washington Redskins starter, Kirk Cousins.
But what are the chances Denver adds Cousins in free agency?
The Redskins are scouting quarterbacks
Sources tell me the Redskins are in the process of scouting the top quarterbacks likely to be available in the 2018 NFL draft with Doug Williams, the Redskins senior vice president of player personnel, traveling across the country to personally scout the best passers.
Williams could have his eye on guys like Josh Rosen (UCLA), Sam Darnold (USC), and Lamar Jackson (Louisville).
Rosen could be the best of the bunch, as he's bright and has a rocket arm, beautiful deep accuracy, and an alpha-male attitude.
Darnold has the tools to be a quality starter in the pros, but, mechanically, he needs to clean up some footwork issues.
Jackson is the most athletic of this group, and he's incredibly dangerous as a runner, reminding some in the scouting community of Houston Texans rookie Deshaun Watson.
Washington has fought hard this year, but, with a 4-6 record, they are unlikely to make the playoffs in an incredibly tough NFC.
Even if they land a top-15 pick, I'm told the Redskins would consider a move up to get a franchise quarterback.
Cousins wants out?
We've seen the Redskins slap the franchise tag on Cousins two years in a row. In 2016 and 2017 combined, Cousins will have made around $44 million fully guaranteed.
Washington actually does have the option to franchise tag Cousins for a third time, if they want to, but the price tag would be outrageous — $34 million for next season alone.
Sources tell me Cousins wants a long-term deal, but he's reluctant to sign a long-term contract with Washington.
If he hits the open market, Cousins could command quite the hefty price tag and get that commitment he's been looking for.
A quick fix for the Broncos
The Broncos need a franchise quarterback, and they've had great success with quarterbacks who started their careers elsewhere.
Following the plan laid out by Peyton Manning in 2012, Denver could try to do the same thing with Cousins in 2018.
They still need to draft a quarterback, in my opinion, whether or not they get Cousins. It's wise to draft and develop a young quarterback if at all possible.
A young quarterback plays with a low price tag and allows you to build other spots on your roster with the extra salary cap space.
There is a serious need for a quality starting quarterback here in the Mile High City, and adding Cousins could all of a sudden make a roster that looks shaky seem somewhat like a contender.
Image: Auris Surgical/U.S. Patent and Trademark Office An artist's rendering (from Auris's patent application) that gives a hint of what the teleoperated ARES surgical robot could look like.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has just approved the first medical robot from Auris Surgical, a stealthy startup led by the co-founder of industry leader Intuitive Surgical, makers of the widely-used da Vinci robot.
The teleoperated ARES robot (the acronym stands for Auris Robotic Endoscopy System), was cleared by the FDA at the end of May, and could now be used for diagnosing and treating patients.
Auris, which describes itself only as a “technology company based in Silicon Valley,” was previously thought to be working on a robotic microsurgical system designed to remove cataracts, and the company has in fact filed several patent applications along those lines.
However, an investigation by IEEE Spectrum suggests that the company has greater ambitions, including, according to current and former employees, “building the next generation of surgical robots… capable of expanding the applicability of robotics to a broad spectrum of medical procedures.”
A close reading of recent patent applications filed by Auris scientists shows that the company is focusing on so-called endolumenal (or endoluminal) surgery. This involves surgeons introducing flexible robots via the body's natural openings (the mouth in particular), to address conditions of the throat, lungs and gastrointestinal system. IEEE Spectrum can reveal that Auris has already carried out at least one successful human trial of such a robot, outside the United States.
Because endolumenal surgery does not involve large incisions or (usually) general anesthesia, it benefits fragile patients who cannot withstand the trauma of normal surgery. The Society for American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons estimates that effective endolumenal therapies for obesity and reflux diseases alone could help more than 1 million patients a year in the United States.
Traditional endoscopes are controlled manually by manipulating levers or dials, with the surgeons helped by images from tiny cameras mounted at the instruments' tips. Some procedures require doctors to operate in contorted positions, and guiding the endoscope can involve complicated CT (computed tomography) scans or X-ray fluoroscopy.
“A robot helps keep your surgical team out of that radiation exposure,” says David Drajeske, president of Applied Dexterity, a start-up that makes a surgical robot for research. “Robotics can also add more precision and repeatedly get tools where they need to be, while maintaining good ergonomics for the surgeon.”
The ARES robot, which Auris has yet to announce publicly, was approved by the FDA as a bronchoscope to view and treat lung conditions. It appears to be quite similar to Medrobotic's Flex Robotic System, an endolumenal robot, fitted with one of a number of surgical instruments, that goes down the throat. The Flex was cleared by the FDA in 2015.
Auris would not confirm that the ARES, which may have a different brand name when it launches, is the same system described in its patent applications. That paperwork describes a system where “interchangeability of instrument device manipulators allow [the] robotic system to perform different procedures… Any number of procedures that may require a tool or no tool at all can be performed using the flexible endoscope.”
One of Auris's patent applications mentions tools including lasers, forceps, needles, graspers, and scalpels, potentially enabling a surgeon to do everything from biopsies and gastric repairs to excising tumors. “Once a device is on the market, there is a tendency for surgeons to look for new ways to make use of it,” says Drajeske.
Like the well known da Vinci robot, Auris's robot would be remotely controlled by a qualified surgeon at a desktop work station. She would operate the robot using 3-D maps generated from a collection of 2-D CT scans, and locate the device with electromagnetic sensors, accelerometers, or even automatic video tracking.
Ariel Waldman, an author, digital anthropologist, and co-founder of Science Hack Day, a global science-based hackathon, is working on the hardware and software interface for Auris. Waldman describes the system as a “new breakthrough surgical robot.”
Although Auris Surgical does not feature in the U.S. government's database of clinical trials, IEEE Spectrum has discovered that in late 2014, Auris sponsored a small clinical trial of a robotic bronchoscope in a hospital in San Jose, Costa Rica.
According to the principal investigator, Dr. José Rafael Rojas Solano: “The pilot study we carried out was to test for the first time on humans, a robot designed to perform diagnostic bronchoscopies on patients with lesions in the bronchi or lungs suspicious [sic] of cancer.”
The study found that Auris's robot was able to navigate the airways of all 15 patients in the trial without adverse effects. Of the nine patients eventually diagnosed with cancer, the robot obtained biopsy material from eight. “This study constitutes the first step of [a] very promising technology in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer,” says Solano.
Auris has grown rapidly since it was started in 2007 by Frederic Moll, co-founder of Intuitive Surgical. Last year, the company raised $150 million from high profile investors including Lux Capital and the Peter Thiel-backed Mithril Capital Management. It then spent $80 million in April to acquire Hansen Medical, yet another surgical robotics firm that Moll had started, back in 2002. While Hansen's robotic catheter and blood vessel robots have not proven as successful as Intuitive's da Vinci, Hansen does hold a horde of patents—and a cross-licensing deal with Intuitive—that could smooth Auris's route into the flexible robotics market.
Auris does have some interesting intellectual property of its own. A patent application published late last year describes a 3-D coordination system for surgical robots that includes an internal ‘geo-fence' to prevent surgeons from accidentally injuring patients from the inside.
“Moll is brilliant and I've been waiting for his next act,” says Ken Goldberg, head of the Berkeley Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering. “I'm very curious if he's considering some form of supervised autonomy. He could pull it off.”
With VC millions in the bank and Auris's first robot almost ready for market, Moll looks well positioned to impress the world yet again.
Carolina Panthers cornerback Josh Norman (24) and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant (88) exchange pleasantries after Carolina's Kurt Coleman returned an interception for a touchdown in the first quarter during the Carolina Panthers vs. the Dallas Cowboys NFL football game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on Thursday, November 26, 2015. (Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News)
All-Pro Redskins cornerback Josh Norman was asked Friday for the wide receiver matchups he's looking forward to most this season.
Norman gave the following list as a guest on ESPN's NFL Live: 1.) Antonio Brown, 2.) A.J. Green, 3.) Kelvin Benjamin, 4.) Dez Bryant, 5.) Odell Beckham Jr.
Norman said he picked Brown and Green because he hasn't defended either much during his four-year career. He had Benjamin third because they were teammates the previous two seasons in Carolina.
The conversation then moved to what makes Bryant so difficult to defend.
"He goes after the ball like no other receiver does like that, besides Julio [Jones]," Norman responded. "There are a handful of guys, but he is more or less making a play out of no play. That's kind of his game, man. He's a game-changer in that aspect. He'll let you know about it and I like playing against guys like that, I really do, because you get the most out of that battle. It makes you want to do more than you thought of yourself. He brings it out of you. I love challenges like that."
A somewhat surprising response considering the words Norman spoke about the Cowboys' star receiver after their matchup last season. Bryant, who clearly wasn't healthy, playing through multiple injuries, was held to only two catches for 26 yards in a 33-14 loss to the Panthers.
While walking back to the Carolina locker room that Thanksgiving Day, Norman said: "Hey, they need to get Dez's 70 mil back."
Bryant signed a five-year, $70 million deal last offseason.
Norman inked a five-year, $75 million deal with the Redskins in April.
Those two will see each other at least twice this season. The Cowboys travel to Washington in Week 2 and host the Redskins in Week 12.
Schiavone Construction Co was awarded an $80.6 million contract for repairs to the M train "Bushwick Cut," pictured above. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Gwynne Hogan
BUSHWICK — A contractor with a history of defrauding the MTA has scored an $80 million contract with the agency.
Schiavone Construction Co. has been partly blamed for delays at the Second Avenue subway line, accused of worker safety violations and had to pay $20M to the government in 2010 after it lied about hiring women and minority owned businesses.
Yet it won the backing of MTA board members for a multi-million dollar deal to rebuild the Bushwick Cut, a spur of the M train line just north of Broadway in Bushwick.
The MTA recently approved the contract, according to board documents published Dec. 12.
Schiavone Construction Co., whose representatives didn't respond to a request for comment, undercut their closest competitor Kiewit Infrastructure Co. by $10 million in the competitive bidding process, according to the MTA.
"The [selection committee] unanimously ranked Schiavone as the most technically qualified firm and unanimously recommended it for award based on the selection criteria," the document reads.
They "provided the best value to NYC Transit."
"Schiavone brings a history of timely and/or accelerated performance of similar work in confined spaces," the document reads.
Schiavone has more than a half a century of experience in the industry and has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts over the years, including $350 million to reconstruct Times Square and South Ferry subway stations.
But in 2010, the company was forced to pay $20 million to the government after a federal investigation revealed it had breached its contract with the MTA by pretending some of its subcontractors were minorities and women — which is required by the MTA.
In 2005, the company was linked to a scheme in which workers at Schiavone were recorded by an informant plotting to hire subcontractors that were posing as minority and women owned business.
In fact they were fronts for mob owned businesses, according to a 2005 affidavit filed in federal court as part of an organized crime probe and reported by the New York Times.
No formal were charges were filed against the company in that case.
In its current work on the Second Avenue subway line, a contract it shared with two other companies, the three firms were cited for a slew of worker safety issues including lacking proper fall protection and training requirements and allowing workers to be exposed to gas, vapors or mists without proper respiratory protection, according to records from the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
And a goof on the part of the trio in which they incorrectly set up dynamite in 2012 led to an explosion that rocked the Upper East Side, the Daily News reported.
When asked about the company's track record, MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said, "NYC Transit has performed a thorough background check on Schiavone and finds them to be a responsible contractor."
For the Bushwick Cut reconstruction, Schiavone is required to subcontract 15 percent to minority-owned and 15 percent to women-owned businesses, according to the MTA.
When asked how the MTA would assure that Schiavone upholds the latest contract's requirement, spokesman Ortiz said, "We hold all of our contractors accountable."
I want to talk about the greatest thing our forefathers and mothers left us here in the United States.
It's known around the world that the United States always pays its debts. Rain or shine, war or peace. Whether we're a scrappy young country or the sole remaining superpower. Hey you might not like us, or we might not like you, but that's not the point. You will invest in the United States because when it comes to money our word is sacred. We are safe. We're pretty much the only country that people depend on this way. It's something we can and should be proud of.
And that, I hear, is the cornerstone of the world economy. Take away the trust in the United States economy and the whole thing crumbles.
The tradition goes all the way back to the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton.
And because of that, our currency is the reserve currency of the world. We create money that everyone believes in. We are exceptional in this regard. It's why we live relatively well while producing relatively little. The thing we make that everyone wants that no one else can make is the US dollar. But it doesn't have to continue that way. We could be the generation that blows up the legacy. Simply by failing to pay the interest on our debt. Which is, I understand, what would happen if the Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling. Or even seems to be seriously considering it. That would spoil the trance and we would quickly (instantly) lose what makes us special.
The people we elected are getting ready to piss that away. If we let it happen not only will our children and grandchildren curse us, rightly, but so will the ghosts of our ancestors. We will go down as the stupidest generation ever. The one who had it all and threw it all away.
Persistent Questions About the Future of the US Economy
We've covered a lot of ground over the past few months. Not much action in the markets yesterday, so let's stop here and take stock.
What we know so far…
First, it was clear from the get-go that there was a bubble in finance and housing. The only people who couldn't see it were the people in finance and housing…and the feds. It reached its peak in '05-'07…then, exploded.
Second, it was obvious that the US economy entered a period of debt destruction — a Great Correction, we called it. There was never really any hope of ‘recovery.' Once it blows up, you can't put the pieces of a bubble back together.
Third, the question then was how long the Great Correction would last…which depended on what it was correcting. No one knows. We're still correcting the debt bubble, which could take another 10 years or so. But this correction could be tough; there are other things going on. Which led us to start asking questions about what we don't know:
Can any government in the developed world survive? Will there be enough growth to keep them from going broke? Was the growth of the post-war period a fluke? Was the Industrial Era driven entirely by cheap energy…a ‘growth spurt' that is now played out? Are the developed economies so burdened by zombie institutions that they can never hope to compete with the emerging markets? How do governments shuck off the zombies?
Those questions gave us something to think about.
We saw, for example, that the theories of government were mostly wishful thinking, apologia, and claptrap. Government is raw force…used to transfer wealth and status to the insiders who control it. The reason for the triumph of democratic government is that it gives more people the illusion of power…and welcomes more people as insiders (however modest their participation). As time goes by, more and more groups get special privileges, contracts, jobs, tax breaks, bailouts, protections and redistributions. Eventually, there are more insiders collecting wealth than there are outsiders producing it. Then, reform is practically impossible. The political system is entirely under the control of the zombies. The only resolution of this is catastrophe — either in the form of bankruptcy, hyperinflation, war, revolution, or some combination.
Zombies are expensive parasites. The more political power they gain, the less flexible and adaptable the economy and the society become. Capitalism is corrupted. The ‘system' cannot correct itself. Politicians may talk about cutting spending, balancing the budget, and protecting the nation's finances. But they can't do it. The leeches want more and more blood. Sooner or later, the host goes broke.
But bankruptcy is not the biggest menace — not for the US. An empire risks losing its soul as well as its money. That is the drama we are watching in the Republican presidential race. The devil has already laid his trap — the Pentagon budget, Homeland Security, Patriot Act, the Defense Authorization Bill, sidelining Congress, torture, the use of drones at home and abroad, the pre-meditated murder of Osama bin Laden. It is probably just a matter of time until it springs shut.
“Wait, Bill,” writes a reader. “You keep going on and on about the Pentagon. But the military is going to take the budget bullet, if you know what I mean. That's where the automatic cuts are focused.”
Oh yeah? More below…
Of course, we don't know what will happen. We're just watching, wondering…guessing…like everyone else. We're also probably a bit more ‘pessimistic' than most observers. Because we have a lower opinion of our fellow man than most people do. Not that he is bad. But he is subject to influence. And sometimes the influences upon him are rotten. The average person we meet is a decent enough character; we almost always like him. But the average Roman in Caligula's reign was probably a decent fellow too. Sometimes people get trapped…where the worst take over…and decent people can't stop them.
Remember the meeting at Davos with the “remodeling capitalism” theme? We were suspicious and dismissive. After all, no one ever modeled capitalism in the first place. It seemed vain to talk about remodeling it.
Besides, we've seen these architects and decorators at work before. We wouldn't want to live in a house they designed.
Stephen Roach, an economist with Morgan Stanley and Yale, took part in the discussion. His account of the conference confirms our guess: this was the most prestigious meeting of dumbbells on the planet.
One speaker urged a repudiation of materialistic values. Another wanted to confront human rights abuses. Another wanted to make some point about the Arab Spring.
Two thirds of the participants, writes Roach in The Financial Times, “felt capitalism was not working.” But none seemed to have any idea of what capitalism really is…or what might be wrong with it.
A group of Occupy agitators broke into a chant: “No speeches. No stage. Join us!”
Join us? Why?
“We simply cannot continue to cut our defense budget if we are to remain the hope of the Earth,” says Mitt Romney.
Where do candidates get this sort of stuff? Who writes lines like that? Who takes them seriously?
According to Romney, the Earth itself longs for more US military spending.
His adversary, Newt Gingrich, says he thinks that Obama's Pentagon cuts will make the US as vulnerable to attack as it was before World War II.
But the Pentagon won't really have less money to spend. They're not really talking about cutting defense spending; they're talking about cutting projected military spending increases. Even after the ‘cuts,' the US military will still be spending more than the next 10 biggest spenders put together.
While Republican candidates try to out-Rambo each other, the president himself sends teams of Navy Seals to rescue American hostages…and never fails to remind Americans that he was the one who ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden.
All the candidates think the American people want war. Or…what?
Actually, Americans don't want war. The latest Pew Research polls show them more opposed to foreign military adventures than at any time in the last 15 years. They're more interested in getting a job…and protecting their retirements. Given the choice, they would probably want to see military spending cut back and the money put into their own pockets.
But they won't be given the choice. The system is rigged. Between them and the outcomes are 10,000 lobbyists and millions of zombies. This is why representative democracy doesn't work.
Decent people will generally have decent responses to decent questions. Put to a ballot, how would American's vote?
1. Should the US balance its budget…or continue to spend $1.50 for every dollar in revenue?
2. If you have to give up something, which would you rather do without: foreign wars…or domestic health and retirement benefits?
3. Should Congressmen be forced to leave Washington after a maximum of 2 terms?
4. Should members of Congress be forced to live by the same laws as the voters?
5. What do you say to a flat 10% tax rate, on all income…across the board…? Yes or no?
6. Should the President be allowed to kill or imprison anyone he wants, without due process of law?
Our guess is that the voters would do the right thing.
But they'll never get the chance. The system is in the hands of the zombies now. Lobbyists, lawyers, connivers, chiselers, contractors, layabouts and scalawags and world-improvers — each one takes a little piece of the old republic…until there's nothing left.
Tomorrow: how the zombies work…

Correction Appended
The clearest explanation yet of the forces that converged over the past three decades or so to undermine the economic well-being of ordinary Americans is contained in the new book, “Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer — and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class.”
The authors, political scientists Jacob Hacker of Yale and Paul Pierson of the University of California, Berkeley , argue persuasively that the economic struggles of the middle and working classes in the U.S. since the late-1970s were not primarily the result of globalization and technological changes but rather a long series of policy changes in government that overwhelmingly favored the very rich.
Those changes were the result of increasingly sophisticated, well-financed and well-organized efforts by the corporate and financial sectors to tilt government policies in their favor, and thus in favor of the very wealthy. From tax laws to deregulation to corporate governance to safety net issues, government action was deliberately shaped to allow those who were already very wealthy to amass an ever increasing share of the nation's economic benefits.
“Over the last generation,” the authors write, “more and more of the rewards of growth have gone to the rich and superrich. The rest of America, from the poor through the upper middle class, has fallen further and further behind.”

Last year was a terrific year for those at the very top. Professors Hacker and Pierson note in their book that investors and executives at the nation's 38 largest companies earned a stunning total of $140 billion — a record. The investment firm Goldman Sachs realized profits of $13.4 billion and paid its employees an average of nearly $500,000 per person in total compensation.

Something has gone seriously haywire in the distribution of the fruits of the American economy.
This unfortunate shift away from a long period of more widely shared prosperity unfolded steadily, year after year since the late-'70s, whether Democrats or Republicans controlled the levers of power in Washington. “Winner-Take-All Politics” explores the vexing question of how this could have happened in a democracy in which — in theory, at least — the enormous number of voters who are not rich would serve as a check on policies that curtailed their own economic opportunities while at the same time supercharging the benefits of the runaway rich.
INCHEON South Korea (Reuters) - The head of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) has launched a scathing attack on India over its refusal to enter a cricket team at the Asian Games, saying its decision was “killing” the sport.

Twenty20 Cricket was added to the Asian Games programme four years ago as a way to try and promote the sport in the region.
But India, the world's richest and most influential cricketing nation, has steadfastly refused to send a men's or women's team to either the 2010 or the 2014 Asian Games.
The Board Of Control For Cricket In India (BCCI) said its players were too busy with their other commitments. The Asian Games, which ended in South Korea on Saturday, clashed with the lucrative Champions League Twenty20 taking place in India.
But the OCA president, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, said India's stance was short-sighted and damaging the game.
“They are killing cricket, limiting the NOCs (National Olympic Committees) participating in cricket and killing the market,” Sheikh Ahmad told a news conference at the Asian Games on Saturday.
“Sorry to say this as a sports fan, but this is the reality. This is why cricket is only a Commonwealth sport.”
India has also opposed the inclusion of cricket at other multi-sports events, including the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games, a stance that has put them at odds with other cricketing nations and players.
Sri Lanka, the current Twenty20 world champions, sent a team to the Asian Games and won the men's gold medal, beating Afghanistan in the final.
Pakistan won the women's gold medal for the second time in a row, but followed India's lead and did not send a men's team because many of its best players are competing in the big-spending Champions League.
Australia's players have been very vocal in arguing that cricket should be on the Olympic programme but the International Cricket Council (ICC) has been opposed to the idea.
Sheikh Ahmad, one of the most powerful men in the Olympic movement, said the OCA could not force India to compete at the Asian Games but he was disappointed by its stance.
“When we put a sport in a programme, we always wish to have the top athletes here,” he said.
“I'm sorry that the Indian delegate did not attend. We have to respect their own request.
“The people in charge want money. This is not a sport, this is business,” the OCA chief said.
“I hope in future they will understand keeping it as your baby in your chest — it's not your personal toy, it's the people's game and you have to deliver it for the people.
“You can be rich by the game but you have to cover the other sector, and this is why cricket is still only a Commonwealth sport,” he added.
The increasing influence of India's mega-rich Twenty20 leagues has come under widespread criticism in recent years with former players and administrators complaining it has become too powerful and could be fuelling corruption in the game.
Just last month, former England all-rounder Ian Botham called for the Indian Premier League (IPL) to be scrapped because it was taking players away from representing their own countries.
Botham said he also feared that the IPL could unwittingly fuel corruption and gambling — a scourge which has tarnished the sport's image in recent years.

The current chairman of the ICC is Narayanaswami Srinivasan, an Indian industrialist who is currently being investigated over a betting scam on IPL matches.
Earlier this year, Srinivasan was ordered by the Supreme Court to stand down as president of the BCCI after his son-in-law was indicted for illegal betting on IPL.
“Corruption is enough of a problem in itself, but the IPL compounds that problem given it provides the perfect opportunity for betting and therefore fixing,” Botham said.
Donald Trump may have won the election, but he lost the American people. Trump comes to office with no mandate.
To date, Trump is behind Hillary Clinton in the popular vote by over 2.2 million votes: the worst absolute margin of victory in all of American history. The runner-up? George Bush losing the popular vote by over 500,000 in 2000.
And it's just as bad for Trump where it really counts, in his percent of the total vote. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary by 1.63 points (1.63%), and growing. Hillary currently has 47.97% of the vote, while Trump only has 46.34%.
That means Donald Trump won the presidency by the 3rd worst margin in American history. Let that sink in a moment.
Historically, only two presidents fared worse than Trump in the percent difference in the popular vote: Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and John Quincy Adams in 1824.
Trump's abysmal showing in the popular vote is small comfort to Democrats who fear the far-right kleptocracy that is coming to Washington in Trump's wake. But Trump's lack of a mandate matters, as it will severely hamper the Republican Party's efforts to drastically change the country.
Look at the list of elections below. Note that the handful of elections in pink are those in which the winner lost the popular vote. The orange/yellow highlight is Trump v. Clinton. I have ranked the elections according to the percentage difference in the popular vote. You'll see that in every single election, save two, the winning candidate did better than Donald Trump . (Below the image, further discussion about why this matters.)
As I noted above, our president is picked according to Electoral College rules rather than the popular vote. But, presidents like to claim mandates in order to push their agenda, and you do not win a mandate when you lose the popular vote. And you really don't win a mandate when you have the third-weakest victory in all of American history.
Quite simply: The American people did not vote for Donald Trump; they voted for Hillary Clinton. Trump's loss in the popular vote isn't just indicative that Trump has no mandate, it's a truly unprecedented rebuke of an incoming president.
Keep these numbers in mind as Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and Trump's stand-in as president, the ultra-far-right Mike Pence, try to implement their radical un-American agenda, starting with the abolishment of Medicare.
With the election of Donald Trump, AMERICAblog's independent journalism and activism is more needed than ever.

4-player split screen won't be possible when Halo 5: Guardians comes out next year for the Xbox One.
4-player split screen was popularized back in the day with games like Goldeneye and Mario Kart back in the '90s. The Halo series continued this tradition even though online multiplayer grew a lot in the '00s.
A fan asked 343 Industries' Josh Holmes on Twitter if split screen is possible in the Halo 5: Guardians beta. The beta itself is just a single player affair, but split screen is possible in the full game.
Holmes however said that “local split screen for 2 players” will be in the final build of Halo 5: Guardians. This pretty much confirms that four player split screen is no longer an option to do for hardcore Halo fans.
This is disappointing to hear, but at least offline multiplayer will still be retained in Halo 5: Guardians. Hopefully 343 Industries shares more if there will be co-op in the main campaign too. After all, the story has both Master Chief and Agent Locke.
The addition of any sort of local 2 player modes in Halo 5: Guardians is cool to hear anyway. Games like Destiny, Titanfall and even a racing game like The Crew have all been single player games with online modes only. Offline multiplayer isn't dead yet which is good news.
Wealthy Americans earn about 50 percent of all income but pay nearly 70 percent of the federal tax burden, according to the latest analysis Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office — though the agency said the very richest have seen their share of taxes fall the last few years.
CBO looked at 2007 through 2009 and found the bottom 20 percent of American earners paid just three-tenths of a percent of the total tax burden, while the richest 20 percent paid 67.9 percent of taxes.
The top 1 percent, who President Obama has made a target during the presidential campaign, earns 13.4 percent of all pre-tax income, but paid 22.3 percent of taxes in 2009, CBO said. But that share was down 4.4 percentage points from 2007, CBO said in a finding likely to bolster Mr. Obama's calls for them to pay more by letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire.
The big losers over the last few years were the rest of the well-off, especially those in the top fifth, who saw their tax burdens go up.
“Specifically, between 2007 and 2009, the share of taxes paid fell for the bottom three income quintiles, was close to flat for the fourth quintile, but rose for the highest quintile,” CBO said. “Within the top quintile, however, the shift was uneven; the share paid by the top percentile fell, and the share paid by the rest of the top quintile rose.”
The tax fight has risen to the top of this year's presidential campaign, with Mr. Obama calling for the wealthy to pay more money both to lower the deficit and fund his new spending promises. He wants households making $250,000 or more a year to see their rates return to Clinton-era levels, though he has proposed a one-year extension of the rest of the Bush-era rates.
Republicans have countered that they want a one-year extension of all current rates in order to have breathing space to tackle a broader overhaul of the tax code.
CBO, the nonpartisan agency that serves as Congress' official scorekeeper, said the current tax code is progressive chiefly because of the income-tax structure. On average, the lowest 40 percent of earners actually get money back through the income-tax code because of refundable tax credits.
Overall, the federal tax rates in 2008 and 2009 — at 18 percent and 17.4 percent — were the lowest in the last three decades, suggesting at least part of the reason the federal government has run record deficits in recent years.
In terms of actual earnings, the top 1 percent suffered the most in the recession, with their average earnings dropping from $1.9 million to $1.2 million. The lowest 20 percent saw their incomes drop from $23,900 to $23,500 during that time.
CBO included a wide range of measures of income including wages, employer-paid health insurance premiums and capital gains.
CBO said the top 1 percent earned an average of $1.9 million in pre-tax income in 2009, while the top 20 percent as a whole averaged $273,000. The fourth quintile averaged $98,400, the middle quintile averaged $67,600, the second quintile averaged $45,600 and the lowest quintile averaged $23,900 in income.

From the age of three, little Stephanie knew she was different. Growing up in Germany, she hated wearing dresses so much that her grandmother sewed her special trousers and shirts.
Wearing her hair very short, she was regularly mistaken for a little boy, and would even introduce herself to strangers as Stefan.
Twenty-seven years and several operations later, Stephanie is now Liam.
"I'd always felt a little confused about my gender identity, but I hadn't thought too much about it as a child," explains Liam, now 40. "But when I hit puberty, I began growing the most enormous breasts, and it was very distressing for me."
Huge relief
Liam hid his breasts underneath big, baggy sweatshirts, and developed poor posture from hunching over to hide his burgeoning chest.
"I'd stopped introducing myself as Stefan at this age and was living as a girl, but I felt that there was something very wrong," says Liam. "But I couldn't work out exactly what it was that was making me feel so unhappy."

Tentatively, Liam (then still Stephanie) began to date boys, but it stirred up a lot of emotions.
"I really couldn't figure it out," he says. "I didn't feel gay, and I wasn't really interested in men or women. I didn't enjoy sex, even when I fell in love for the first time."
Liam muddled along unhappily until one day something happened that would change his life forever. At the age of 21, he got a job in a cinema.
"It was a very boring summer, so I read a lot of library books," he remembers. "There was one book which had a story about transgender people. I was sitting there next to the popcorn machine, turning the pages and I had the sudden realisation that I was transgender."
(Image: Liam Klenk)
In those days, transgender people such as the Kardashian's former stepfather Caitlyn Jenner and boxing promoter Kelly Maloney were less common in the media, so Liam hadn't had anyone he felt he could relate to. But that afternoon, he suddenly understood a part of himself that he'd struggled with for his whole life.
"The realisation was a huge relief, but I was also completely terrified," explains Liam. "There was no choice, I had to become a man – even if that meant losing my friends and family.
"I knew that if I didn't begin gender reassignment, I'd probably end up either killing myself or being horribly unhappy for the rest of my life. With surgery at least I'd have a shot at happiness."

Liam found local self-help groups and, for the first time in his life, began to meet people who felt the same way as he did. But he thought the groups were depressing, because so many of the people there were deeply unhappy and felt that they'd lost years of their lives by living in the wrong body.
Liam wanted to look at his change in a positive light, so decided to see his doctor. After psychiatric tests, he began hormone therapy. Over the course of a year, he injected himself every 20 days with drugs that started to make him more masculine.
"I felt excited but also scared," he says. "But it felt like the only way forward and I had a funny sensation that everything would be okay. It was like a second puberty, and for a while I was a weird hybrid creature, a woman with big breasts, a budding beard and a deepening voice."
Positive reaction
Still working at the cinema, Liam had struggled to explain his changing body to his colleagues. As his voice broke during his ‘second puberty,' he had pretended he had a cold. But one day he decided the time had come to tell the truth.
"One evening, I just sat them down and told them I had an announcement to make," says Liam. "I was so freaked out and nervous, as a lot of them were older and quite conservative . I said, “Guys look, I'm not really a woman I'm actually a man and I would really appreciate it if you could all call me Liam.”'
The reaction from his co-workers was overwhelmingly positive, but one colleague had something more to say.
"The projectionist was very conservative and had this twirled moustache," remembers Liam. "He sat me down, all serious and I was worried. But he just said, “Liam? Really? That's the best you could come up with?” and that was it!"
Liam's mother found it difficult at first, but did her best to understand her son. His father, who later came out as gay, was more understanding.

"He told me he'd always suspected there was a boy inside me because of the strange things I'd done as a child," he says. "He gave me a present, it was a bottle of cologne and a razor. It was so touching it made me cry."
At the end of the year, Liam had some further gruelling psychiatric tests to establish that he was ready for surgery.
"I wanted my female organs out of me because they felt so foreign and alien."
At 22, Liam had two major surgeries.
"I had my ovaries removed first, and I woke up after the operation and felt great," says Liam. "Three months later, I had my breasts removed. I was so happy – straight away I said, “Oh my God I can see my feet!”
"It was an awesome feeling and, even though it was a big operation, I didn't have any complications, just a few annoying weeks of wearing bandages and taking it easy."

Eventually, Liam's love of the sea took him to the Maldives, where he qualified as a Scuba Diving instructor – a job he never would have had the confidence to do.
"For the first few years I was very shy about taking my shirt off in public because my scars are pretty big," says Liam. "So to get over my fears, I took a job where I had to take my shirt off pretty much every day! And now I don't care, I take it off wherever."
Liam moved to Hong Kong in 2012, where he met his wife Helena.
"I'd had some lovers before, but they were very frantic affairs – when I met her it was very calm. The more I talked to her, the more I realised there was so much depth to her."
"I don't need a penis…"
Of course, any new relationship for Liam means he needs to explain his gender history. Although he has had the surgery to remove his female organs and has had hormone therapy for years, he took the decision not to have a penis constructed – a choice which his psychiatrist says shows just how sane he is.
"At that time, it was a very dangerous procedure, and would need about 30 follow-up operations," explains Liam. "But I don't need a penis, it isn't what makes you a man. Plus, I didn't want to lose my sensation while having sex."
Helena was completely relaxed about Liam's revelation, and the couple went from strength to strength. Now blissfully married, Liam could not be happier.
"The things that I've been through have made me a more compassionate person," says Liam. "I'm grateful that I experienced part of my life as a girl, because I can understand the world better.
"I'm never going to whistle at women in the street, I'm never going to be disrespectful towards them because I know how it feels to be both a woman and a man."

A grotesque collision of fossil-fuel-laden vessels happened in a bayou south of New Orleans on Tuesday evening, where tug-boat operators crashed a barge carrying crude oil into a submerged natural-gas pipeline.
The result was predictable: A spectacular conflagration erupted that injured two of the four members of the tug-boat crew, including the captain, who reportedly suffered burns covering more than three quarters of his body. Emergency crews on Wednesday were scrambling to contain spilled oil spreading south of the accident.
The crash occurred at about 6 p.m. local time 30 miles south of New Orleans on Bayou Perot, according to the Coast Guard.
Pipeline owner Chevron isolated the severed section of line by shutting off some of its valves, and emergency crews allowed the gas left inside it to burn off, The Washington Post reports. Various outlets reported that the barge was carrying more than 2,000 barrels of oil and that the tug boat was fueled with diesel.
The fire burned through the night and past dawn.
The oil spill may be substantial. In a telephone interview on WGNO this morning, while the tug and pipeline still burned, a Coast Guard spokesman said a 30-foot-wide ribbon of “what looks like combusted oil” was heading south from the accident site.
The fishing area and oil and gas field is no stranger to fossil-fuel accidents. Shorelines in the area were heavily polluted following BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the spring and summer of 2010. And in late 2010, three welders were injured when the rig they had been working aboard in the shallow waterway exploded.
Italy has been packed full of NATO and US military bases across the country, which serve as testing grounds for the US and the alliance; Sputnik Italy talked to Fulvio Grimaldi, Italian journalist, war correspondent and documentarian on the everyday damage these military facilities cause to the country.
"We fell victim to the self-restrictions contrary to our own interests. Europe is tormenting itself," Grimaldi told Sputnik while commenting on the issue.
"It is in the interests of the US that Italy has imposed sanctions on Russia which have harmed Moscow less than Italian farmers and the country's industry, which have subsequently found themselves in grave economic conditions," he noted.
The journalist further acknowledged that his home country has been forcefully militarized. There are around 90 US bases in the country, let alone a lot more NATO bases on its territory, which are at the US disposal.
"We are a country overflowing with military bases, and this is a serious burden for our economy to the detriment of construction, maintenance of medical facilities, schools and land improvement," the journalist said.
These military facilities also put Italy at risk of becoming a potential target for those countries who will decide one day to stand up to NATO aggression.
The correspondent cites as an example the American Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), a modern satellite communications system located in Sicily, the largest Mediterranean island, which is capable of reaching out to Africa and the Middle East.
"It is a huge social and industrial burden for the island," he said.

Another example is the US military facility on another large Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea, Sardinia, which serves as a testing range for the newly released weaponry which pollutes the environment and threatens the health of local residents.
The economic damage is also substantial. NATO military operations around the globe cost the Italian defense ministry 55 million euro ($61.7mln) per day. If you take into account the expenses of other related ministries, the daily cost rises to 80 million ($89.7mln).
"This is the contribution of the country which has no interest in the military operation in any country of the world, because it is facing no threats," Grimaldi said.
The US military and political control over the Italian territory comes as the aftermath of the Second World War which deprived Italy of its sovereignty.
"I see no reasons for optimism in such a situation. What I actually see is the acknowledgment of similar subordination in other countries of the EU, and this aggressive strategy of NATO is leading us towards an epic failure," the journalist said.
However he added that he is certain that one day the authorities will finally come to their senses and change their stance towards the alliance.

The day was a turning point in his life Two-hundred-and-seventy people died in the Lockerbie plane bombing nearly 20 years ago. As new questions are raised over the conviction of the bomber, one man continues to marvel at his lucky escape from the doomed flight. At Heathrow Airport on 21 December 1988, Jaswant Basuta checked in for Pan Am flight 103 to New York in plenty of time. "After all," he thought, "you can't be too careful - what with the Christmas rush and everything." Tomorrow was an important day. The next morning, the 47-year-old car mechanic was due to start a new job and his wife, Surinder, was coming to the airport to collect him. He had come to the UK to attend a family wedding in Belfast, but now he was looking forward to going home. FIND OUT MORE The Conspiracy Files: Lockerbie is on BBC Two on Sunday 31 August at 2100 BST or catch up on iPlayer after the broadcast Visit The Conspiracy Files website
Lockerbie evidence not disclosed Timeline: Lockerbie bombing Some relatives from nearby Southall had come to see him off at the terminal and they decided to take Jaswant for a drink in the bar upstairs. Jaswant was by no means a heavy drinker but on the odd occasion when there was cause for celebration, he was partial to a Carlsberg Special Brew. And what with all his relatives here, today certainly was a special occasion. No doubt about it. One drink led to another. And another. And slowly Jaswant wasn't in such a rush anymore. "When his glass is empty, make sure you pour him another," his brother-in-law said to the barman. The barman duly obliged. Row at the gate Finally, he insisted he really must be going and it was only as he tore himself away that he realised the time was rapidly approaching flight time: six o'clock. "Pan Am 103, New York, Gate Closing," was flashing on the departure screen. Eleven were killed on the ground It was one of those awful, sinking, slow-motion moments when one suddenly becomes very sober, very quickly. Or at least one tries to. He said a hurried farewell, grabbed his bag and ran for the departure gate. An Olympic athlete wouldn't have made it in time but that didn't stop Jaswant trying. He made it quickly through passport control and security and thundered down the travelator, only to arrive at the gate to see the room empty except for the Pan Am ground crew breezily tidying up at the desk. They were not impressed with his athletic prowess. No matter how much the slightly tipsy Jaswant pleaded, begged and argued the ground crew didn't give any, well, ground. Why me? Why was I saved?
Voices were raised on both sides, but it was no good. Through the window he could see the 747 jumbo jet gently push back from the gate and slowly taxi away under the sodium lights towards the end of the runway. It was just after six o'clock. A thoroughly dejected Jaswant drifted away and prepared to spend a fitful night on a row of seats in the departure lounge. He felt unable to call home and face the music. After a couple of dozy hours, things went from bad to worse. Across the hall Jaswant saw two policemen walking purposefully towards him. "Are you the passenger who missed the Pan Am flight?" Confused, he was bundled away. The police station at Heathrow airport is not a friendly place if you're just suspected of having caused Britain's worst terrorist attack. Near-miss For although Jaswant wasn't aware of it, 38 minutes after take off, Pan Am flight 103 had blown up over the Scottish borders town of Lockerbie killing all 259 passengers and crew on board and 11 people on the ground. The Heathrow police had quickly discovered that one passenger - a certain Basuta, J, Mr - was a no-show at the gate. Pan Am ground crew had been anxious not to delay the departure of the flight and admitted that - in a breach of security regulations - his suitcase had been left on board. There was more to come. Jaswant is a Sikh. Just three years before, Sikh terrorists had been suspected of blowing up an Air India jumbo jet over the North Atlantic, killing all 329 on board. To make matters worse, this Sikh had come to London from Belfast just two days before. The police could be forgiven for thinking they had the case cracked before the fires of Lockerbie had been extinguished. Surinder had grieved like a widow before she heard the news But when the officers started to question their befuddled suspect on suspicion of having caused Britain's biggest mass murder, it became clear he was innocent. When the desk officer got through to the Basuta home near New York, there was much wailing in the background and when Mrs Basuta finally came on the line, he came straight to the point. But before he could explain, an inconsolable Surinder sobbed down the line, "Yes, I've heard on the TV. My husband's plane has crashed." The officer told her that her husband was in fact sitting beside him, but it took some moments for the truth to sink in. 'God had mercy' "It was the happiest moment of my life," says Jaswant, now 67, with tears welling up in his eyes. "We cried and cried and cried." It proved to be a turning point of his life. "Why me? Why was I saved? I should have been the 271st victim and I still feel terrible for all the other people who died." That day, I was given the gift of life
Even now, nearly 20 years on, the experience continues to have a profound effect on this life. He has become a more humble and spiritual person. "I keep thinking why did God have mercy on me? I hadn't even been very religious up until that point in my life. God gave me a second chance." Jaswant doesn't often talk about that night he escaped death. "That day, I was given the gift of life... all over again. It was as if a voice in my head said: 'Now do something good with your life!' It is my duty to repay that gift by helping others in any way I can - and this is what I try to do." Months after the crash, the FBI showed him a photograph of a battered and partially-burned suitcase which they believed was his. It had been recovered from the wreckage at Lockerbie. "They asked me if I wanted it back. But what would I do with that? I have my life and my family, what more do I need?" Guy Smith is producer of The Conspiracy Files: Lockerbie, was broadcast on Sunday, 31 August 2008 at 2100 BST on BBC Two.

The central bank in Azerbaijan has abandoned its currency peg and floated the manat, following a similar move by Kazakhstan earlier this year.
The manat fell by nearly 48 percent against the U.S. dollar (from 1.04 to 1.55 manat to the dollar) following the announcement by the central bank on December 21.
Azerbaijan's central bank said the move was made to "preserve hard currency reserves...and ensure the national economy's competitiveness on the international arena."
In February, Azerbaijan's central bank changed the way it values the manat, moving away from the dollar and instead to a dollar-euro basket.
Falling global energy prices have hit Azerbaijan hard. Energy exports account for about three-quarters of the country's state revenues.
The latest move by Azerbaijan is similar to action taken by Kazakhstan in August when that Central Asian state depegged its currency, the tenge, from the dollar.
Since then, it has lost about 85 percent of its value. Last month, the central bank introduced a new 20,000-tenge note.

Leading ageing expert Aubrey de Grey talks to Sheila Harney and Jessica Elkin on halting the ageing process and what it means for society
07 APRIL 2016 | SHEILA HARNEY AND JESSICA ELKIN
You know, people have this crazy concept that ageing is natural and inevitable and I have to keep explaining that it is not
Dr Aubrey de Grey is a prominent biomedical gerontologist and chief science officer of the SENS Foundation. He is editor-in-chief of Rejuvenation Research, a Fellow of both the Gerontological Society of America and the American Aging Association, and sits on the editorial and scientific advisory boards of numerous journals and organisations.
During his 20 years of work on the biology of ageing he has become well known for his often controversial views and eccentric manner. These centre on the largely theoretical potential to develop techniques to eliminate ageing from our bodies and extend human life expectancy significantly, for potentially up to 1,000 years.
We meet de Grey in a pub in Cambridge on a bright yet chilly Sunday afternoon. He is an intriguing figure; his cut-glass English accent contrasting with the Old Testament-style beard (apparently his wife is a fan) and eclectic attire.
Originally a computer scientist, he graduated from Cambridge in 1985, and spent several years working on artificial intelligence research in software verification. During that time he met his wife, a biology professor. “So over the next couple of years I kind of accidentally learnt a lot of biology,” he explains. “Very gradually it began to dawn on me that we were never talking about ageing.
To me, ageing was the world's most important problem. It was so obvious that I never tested the assumption. I always presumed that everyone else thought the same.”
Shocked to discover that biologists were not focusing on this issue, de Grey started to devote his spare time to educating himself on his wife's specialism, before eventually switching career fields to focus on the topic full-time a few years later. Although his first few papers were well received, once he began to talk about reversing the ageing process he struggled to gain acceptance within the scientific community: “You know, people have this crazy concept that ageing is natural and inevitable, and I have to keep explaining that it is not.”
His views on ageing are simple. “The human body is a machine with moving parts and like a car or an aeroplane, it accumulates damage throughout life as a consequence of normal operation.”
Historically, efforts to postpone the ill health of old age have focused on finding ways to clean up our metabolism so that we accumulate damage to the body more slowly. About 15 years ago, de Grey had a ‘Eureka!' moment upon realising that the most practical way to achieve this would be to find ways to repair the damage rather than looking to slow it down. “I realised we can classify different types of genetic damage into seven major categories, for each of which there is a different repair approach”. This is the focus of the SENS foundation. “We have all these diverse projects across various strands of research that we think need to be done, and because we are an independent non-profit charity, we have the luxury of being able to work on the hardest problems.”
Although some of his views are met with scepticism and disbelief, he feels that the scientific community is become more accepting of his ideas, citing a recent breakthrough publication in Science, one of the world's leading scientific academic publications.
“As time goes on, our progress becomes more significant in proving the feasibility of my ideas. When I first started talking about these, people found them heretical and there was a lot of denigration from the scientific community, but I've gradually won them over. Other people are also making progress in actually implementing what we're doing. Just recently, an important US paper came out that showed you could extend the lifespan of mice using a particular type of damage repair that we'd been talking about for a decade.”
The topic of longevity expansion has also featured in mainstream media of late, with a particular focus on preliminary studies that have found anti-ageing properties in drugs such as Metformin, Rapamycin and Resveratrol, which all demonstrate a phenomenon called calorie-restriction mimetics. De Grey explains what this means for his research. “Essentially, these are drugs that trick the body into thinking that it's in a famine situation when it isn't. Studies have shown that if you take a mouse or a rat and you reduce its normal food intake by 30%, it lives about 30% longer than it would otherwise.
“This was discovered 80 years ago and has been a major topic of interest among gerontologists. Unfortunately, it doesn't scale. The longer-lived the species that you look at, the less the effect of famine in terms of longevity.
During a military training session in Pennsylvania, an unnamed United States Army instructor listed evangelical Christianity as an example of religious extremism along with Al Qaeda and Hamas.
While the session reportedly occurred over a year ago, the matter is just now coming to light. It involved a briefing with an Army Reserve Unit that was receiving training on extremism around the world.
Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) obtained a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which includes a slide that lists 18 religious groups that the instructor deemed to be extremist. While it is not known whether the groups were ordered in relation to their severity, evangelical Christianity appears first on the list, followed by the Muslim Brotherhood, Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, a group called “Christian Identity,” Al Qaeda and Hamas.
“Extremism is a complex phenomenon; it is defined as beliefs, attitudes, feelings, actions, or strategies of a character far removed from the ‘ordinary,'” the slide states. “Because ‘ordinary' is subjective, no religious group would label itself extreme or its doctrine ‘extremism.' However, religious extremism is not limited to any single religion, ethnic group, or region of the world; every religion has some followers that believe that their beliefs, customs and traditions are the only ‘right way' and that all others are practicing their faith the ‘wrong way,' seeing and believing that their faith/religion superior to all others.”
“Extremist organizations follow ideologies which are considered extreme by societal norms,” another slide outlines. “[A]nd we are talking about this today because individuals who hold extremist views that conflict with Army Values are sometimes inadvertently recruited.”
Ron Crews of the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty told reporter Todd Starnes that he was disturbed by the inclusion of evangelical Christians in the presentation.
“We find this offensive to have evangelical Christians … to be listed among known terrorist groups,” he stated. “It is dishonorable for any U.S. military entity to allow this type of wrongheaded characterization.”

Army representative George Wright stated that the slide was not endorsed by the military and was an individual effort.
“This slide was not produced by the Army and certainly does not reflect our policy or doctrine,” he said. “It was produced by an individual without anyone in the chain of command's knowledge or permission.”
Wright also noted that the slide has now been deleted from the presentation due to a complaint. The presenter, who remains unnamed, has since apologized.
One of the soldiers who was present at the training briefing requested copies
“He considers himself an evangelical Christian and did not appreciate being classified with terrorists,” Crews outlined. “There was a pervasive attitude in the presentation that anything associated with religion is an extremist.”
The presentation had utilized information and data collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that classifies “hate groups” throughout the country. The Southern Poverty Law Center came under criticism last year after it branded the Christian non-profit lobbying group Family Research Council as a “hate group” for holding to a Biblical viewpoint on the institution of marriage. It denies, however, that all evangelical Christians are considered “hate groups.”
Julian Green was born in Tampa, Florida to an American father and a German mother. Due to his parent's split nationalities, Green was eligible to play for either the American or German national teams. He was highly sought after by both.
After appearances for both nations — and a contract with Bayern Munich — Green filed for a one-time switch to play for the United States on March 18th, 2014. FIFA approved his change of nationality on March 24th, thereby making him an American international for life.
“Obviously this was a big decision, and I spent a long time discussing it with my family,” Green said, adding, “I was born in Florida and my father still lives there, so I have deep roots in the U.S. I'm very proud to be representing the United States.”
Two days later, Green was called up to the senior national team for a friendly against Mexico, making his debut in the second half. Green was 19 years old at the time.
Two months later, Green was named to the 2014 U.S. World Cup roster. He scored on his first touch of the tournament, a 107th minute volley in U.S' 2-1 Round of 16 loss to Belgium. With this goal, he became the youngest American ever to score in a World Cup.
Following this goal, expectations surrounding Green skyrocketed. Bayern Munich, however, loaned Green to Bundesliga side Hamburger SV for the 2014-2015 campaign, where he only amassed 113 first-team minutes, failing to score a goal.
Green returned to Bayern Munich for the 2015-16 campaign, although he appeared exclusively for the club's fourth-tier reserve side.
Despite failing to impress at Bavaria, Green was selected to participate in the 2016 International Champions Cup, most likely due to his American background. While the tournament is essentially understood to be a glorified exhibition showcase, Green's performance managed to raise a few eyebrows.
The youngster managed a 35-minute hat trick against Italian-side Inter Milan, as Bayern dominated, winning 4-1 at Bank of America Stadium. Following the performance, manager Carlo Ancelotti promised that Green would not be loaned out for the 2016-17 season.
“He will be with us. There is a lot of competition in the squad; it won't be easy for him to play but this preseason he is doing well,” Ancelotti said, adding “he's scored four goals, he is moving well, he is playing well with the team. He has to improve but he is young.”
On October 26th, 2016, Green scored his first competitive goal for Bayern in a 3-1 DFB-Pokal (German Cup) victory over FC Ausburg. With the goal, Green became the first American to score for the club. Green only appeared one other time for Bavaria.
He subsequently left Bavaria over the winter break, moving to second division side VfB Stuttgart on a permanent transfer.
"Julian wants to have a new experience at a club where he'll be a first-team regular," said Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, FC Bayern München AG chairman, adding that this "was tricky at FC Bayern due to a lot of competition. I wish Julian all the best for the future. He always was a hard-working, reliable and very likeable player for FC Bayern."
Green received praise following his first appearance for Stuttgart; a 0-0 draw against MSV Dusiburg.
“Julian Green had a couple of good situations in his first game for us,” Wolf told Stuttgart's website, adding “it was clear to see that he has distinct qualities and that he can help us further. He certainly still needs some match practice, but he'll get that over the next few days and weeks.”
On February 6th, Green finally broke through, scoring for Stuttgart in a 2-0 win over Dusseldorf. In eight appearances for Stuttgart, this was Green's only goal.

Stuttgart, with 63 points, recently secured promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2017-18 season. Julian Green will therefore be back in the top-tier of German soccer.
Green's international and club career has been a disappointment to most fans. In his World Cup selection, Green was lauded as the American soccer messiah, much like Christian Pulisic is today.
Although Green is a solid player, he never truly had Pulisic-like potential. Green's mythical talent was a narrative constructed by Jurgen Klinsmann and only furthered by his World Cup goal, which was most certainly an aberration.
Speaking to ESPN FC in 2013, Klinsmann called Green “a tremendous talent,” adding that we "we have been scouting him for more than two years, and we are thrilled to bring him into our camp and introduce him to the Senior Team program. We believe we could help him grow into a special player.”
Green was Jurgen Klinsmann's big discovery — a youngster who could demonstrate the former manager's eye for talent and hopefully save his job. Klinsmann pursued a similar strategy with other German-Americans (see: Andrew Wooten and Terrence Boyd), but he deemed Green to have the best potential.
Although Green was certainly a talented prospect, he never should've been coronated as the harbinger of American soccer success. By selecting Green over Landon Donovan for the 2014 World and inevitably inviting the comparison between the past and future, Klinsmann did just that.
As Bleacher Report's Dan Levy argued following the roster's release, “Klinsmann's decision is obviously more about the distant future than the immediate, and while Green could turn out to be the best player the U.S. will ever see, Donovan is the best player we've ever seen—past tense—but still good enough that he can help the present team on and off the field in Brazil.”
Klinsmann's actions — referring to Green as a well of talent, selecting him over Donovan and thereby juxtaposing him with the best American to date — unfairly placed American hopes on a severely-inexperienced youngster.
Following Green's 15 minutes of World Cup fame, the hype train only picked up steam. Looking for a silver lining in an otherwise disappointing loss, the American media was quick to highlight Green as the man who would lead the U.S. over the hump and towards an eventual World Cup championship. SportsCenter led the way, likening the youngster to Lionel Messi.

Following SportsCenter's lead, Dan Itel, former writer for MLS, further compared Green to Messi, writing “his (Green's) first goal for the Yanks – coming on his first touch just seconds after his first World Cup appearance in the 107th minute – made him the youngest scorer in the tournament since a certain someone named Lionel Messi opened his account in 2006,” adding “things have since worked out pretty well for Messi,” who scored 12 years ago in Argentina's 6-0 win over Serbia and Montenegro for his first World Cup goal also as a 19-year-old.
Yahoo Sports ran a story on the match with the headline “Julian Green gives U.S. glimpse of future with late goal against Belgium.”
Green, a talented prospect — of which the U.S. has many — was now the physical embodiment of America's promising soccer future. Unsurprisingly, Green has fallen short of this impossible-to-reach benchmark.
Countless articles have deemed Green to be a failure. He has been portrayed as a lazy yet-talented player who has let his country down. While Green should have likely performed better than he has at times, headlines like “Believe the hype, Christian Pulisic can be the superstar Julian Green should have been” are entirely unfair.
Outside of Klinsmann's rhetoric and a 15 minute performance in a single match, there was never a legitimate reason to treat Green as American soccer's next big thing.
Following Stuttgart's promotion and Bruce Arena's hiring, Green may very well have a bright future. He is back in the Bundesliga, where he could secure a solid amount of playing time, meaning that at the least, Green is a solid player on a team in one of the world's best three leagues. It could be a lot worse — ask Freddy Adu.
In terms of the national team, Green confirmed that he has spoken to new headman Bruce Arena.
“He was at the game against Heidenheimer and then we had a talk on the phone,” Green stated, explaining “we had a good talk and I hope I can be in the squad.” Green also told The Washington Post “he (Arena) said he's looking out for me and is always watching what I'm doing here in Stuttgart. And that was it. So we'll see what happens.”
Julian Green is not Christian Pulisic. He never was, and he never will be. While the Klinsmann-fueled hype machine promoted a mythical world in which Green would deliver the U.S. to the promised land, these expectations were unfounded, unwarranted, and wholly unfair.
Green may very well return to the U.S. national team. He may not. Regardless, right now, 21-year-old Julian Green is back in the Bundesliga, making good money, and competing for a spot on the national team.
Really, it could be a lot worse.
Obama Task Force Director On The Cancer 'Moonshot' Initiative
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Back in January at the president's State of the Union address, there was one ambitious announcement that stood out.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BARACK OBAMA: Let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you think, Joe?
(CHEERING)
CORNISH: President Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of what is now called the Cancer Moonshot Task Force. The mission is as ambitious as putting a man on the moon used to be - eliminate cancer as we know it. The task force now has an executive director - Greg Simon. He's been on the job for a week and a half, and he joins me now. Greg Simon, welcome to the program.
GREG SIMON: Thank you.
CORNISH: So talk about exactly what this task force is supposed to do, especially in so short a period of time, right? President Obama's tenure's coming to a close.
SIMON: Well, it is a short period of time, but there are very few problems that are holding us back in cancer research that are unknown. We know what the problems are, and now we need to start the action to deal with those problems because the overarching goal of this initiative is to achieve 10 years of progress in five years.
Now, there are some things that can't be speeded up. You can't do a three-minute egg in one minute, but you don't have to spend six weeks setting it up. And that's often what we do in science. So we're looking at, how can we share data from cancer centers to cancer centers to accelerate knowledge transfer? We're looking at how to communicate with the public the importance of being in clinical trials. We're looking at the importance of the pharmaceutical industry of opening up their compound libraries for more people to explore possible therapeutic agents in those libraries.
CORNISH: You mentioned this idea of getting different cancer center databases to share information. What are the obstacles to that right now?
SIMON: Well, there are cultural obstacles. People tend to want to keep the data in their institution because that data is valuable. It can lead to new therapies. It can lead to new ways to treat patients, and people want them to come to their center.
Our technology for sharing has improved faster than our attitude about sharing, and that's part of what the vice president is doing - is helping change that attitude so that people realize the more you share, the more you have.
CORNISH: Now, you have worked with the medical company Pfizer. You've worked with nonprofits in the cancer care industry. Fundamentally, this is still business, and people are competing with each other.
SIMON: That's true, but this is sort of the tragedy of the commons example. If people don't take care of a common space, it deteriorates, and everybody suffers. The common space here is people surviving cancer. Academia is not very good at taking a drug to market, and they're not very good, and they shouldn't be that good at raising billions of dollars for those clinical trials and the cost of bringing a drug to market.
The pharmaceutical industry is very good at clinical trials and marketing, but they tend not to often have the trust of the people they're trying to help. There are many foundations that want to partner with the pharmaceutical industry to do research into a rare disease that would otherwise not be funded. And the foundations bring money, and they bring patients. But what they don't have are the scientists to develop the drug.
And those collaborations are a way that we can link patient community and the pharmaceutical community for both people's benefits.
CORNISH: Do you worry about overselling what can accomplish here? I mean, it's called the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. Do you think people think you're going to cure caner altogether?
SIMON: Well, we try to avoid giving the impression that in between now and the end of term we're going to cure cancer now and forever, but what we can do, is we can identify what needs to be done and put the power of the vice president and the president behind it while we're here and create a blueprint for any next administration to take this forward because the kind of issues we're dealing with are things that can ease the path for the scientist out there to do their job better.
You know, I always say that the people who are in the system don't have the time to fix the system. They're too busy trying to save our lives with new drugs and therapies. But those of us on the outside - it's our job to fix the system. And there are plenty of things in the system that are totally amenable to being improved this year and over the next several years that will save lives.
CORNISH: Greg Simon is a executive director of the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. Thank you so much for speaking with us.
SIMON: Thank you.

This can't be right: A powerful corporation making a risky decision that put costs ahead of environmental safety? That's crazy talk!
About 11 hours before the Deepwater Horizon exploded, a disagreement took place between the top manager for oil giant BP PLC on the drilling rig and his counterpart for the rig's owner, Transocean Ltd., concerning the final steps in shutting down the nearly completed well, according to a worker's sworn statement.
Michael Williams, a Transocean employee who was chief electronics technician on the rig, said there was "confusion" between those high-ranking officials in an 11 a.m. meeting on the day of the rig blast, according to a sworn statement from Mr. Williams reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Williams himself attended the meeting.
The confusion over the drilling plan in the final hours leading up to the explosion could be key to understanding the causes of the blowout and ultimately who was responsible.
What is known from drilling records and congressional testimony is that after the morning meeting, the crew began preparations to remove from the drill pipe heavy drilling "mud" that provides pressure to keep down any gas, and to replace this mud with lighter seawater.
Ultimately, the crew removed the mud before setting a final 300-foot cement plug that is typically poured as a last safeguard to prevent combustible gas from rising to the surface. Indeed, they never got the opportunity to set the plug.
[...] Typically well owner BP would have final say, since it was paying roughly $1 million a day to lease the rig and pay for services from 12 companies that had people on the rig.
What is clear is that workers soon began displacing the mud. Later that afternoon a pressure test provided ambiguous readings, a possible sign of gas seeping in, according to what Rep. Henry Waxman says a BP executive told House investigators. Eventually, in the evening, after further tests, BP made a decision to carry forth in removing more drilling mud. The rig blew about 10 p.m.
Hello everyone!With today's update, we're fixing a few things which have been lingering in the queue for a while:* Two of the achievements could not be triggered, this has now been fixed.* Material required for World upgrades have been rebalanced to the following values: 250, 750, 1500, 2500, 5000.We reworked the vertex build algorithm for chunks and ships to produce less memory swapping and therefore remove crash causes.Also, we fixed a significant performance leak with ingame video players.

Hello fellow Galactineers!Today is a great day, we're officially leaving Early Access!The project now been in development for 6,5 years and in Early Access for almost exactly three years, and in our eyes, the game has developed big in that time.Now is the best time to sayto everyone who contributed to the project during this great journey, with their ideas, playtests, bug reports and feature requests!We went through two entire refactorings of the game code and implemented all features planned for the Early Access phase - but also a lot more thanks to your feedback: We added PVE missions, coop raids, PVP arenas and a lot of balancing and UI features due to community request. Last but not least: A lot has been done in terms of tutorials, in-game wikis and videos, which wasn't originally planned for Early Access.
Now we feel, the project evolved far enough to call it a game! We know there are still a few empty PVE spots on your map, which we will fill in the next time, but there's still the option for the community to contribute and to be part of it. Community made missions may also be added in place of developer made missions. To celebrate the full release, we're launching with a 10% discount for everyone new to the game. Join now, try it out, download some cool community ships from the workshop, and have fun! Cheers Chris
This Christmas, Concussion will bring to the big screen the latest saga in football's inherent reckoning with the damage and violence it inflicts upon players. This sort of condemnation, however, is not new.
Over a century ago, opponents of football charged that the sport was too violent to deserve any reputable sanction in the United States. The Washington Star newspaper featured an article titled “The Game of Manslaughter” (PDF) lamenting that the 1897 football season had only just begun and “yet at least three deaths have already occurred as the direct results of” football.
The danger of concussions was known even then: “The latest death was typical of most others that are to be charged against the game. The victim had the ball, was tackled and thrown, and was instantly buried beneath a mound of human forms. His brain suffered a fatal concussion and he died within a few hours practically without having regained consciousness.”
Amidst this rising tide of opposition to football's brutality arose a new game: basketball.
Played for the first time on Dec. 21, 1891, basketball debuted at the YMCA's Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. The YMCA instructor responsible for the sport, James Naismith, was attempting to find a sport playable indoors during winter months. In devising his new sport, Naismith keenly observed contemporary sports and attempted to mitigate, if not altogether remove, the odious violence of football.
FOOTBALL'S TENSION
The most popular American sports in the 1890s were baseball and football. Baseball was the domain of professionals and football championed as the sport of amateurs. The YMCA was one of, if not the, premier champion of amateur sports in this period. So, even if riddled with violence, football had a measure of redeeming value thanks to its overwhelming amateur nature.
In December 1891, the same month basketball was invented, the YMCA Training School's journal, The Triangle, dedicated an entire edition to football. The Triangle, edited by none other than Naismith, featured the following graphic on what made amateur football superior to professional baseball:
Baseball was clearly not the sport of choice for the amateur enthusiasts within the YMCA. Not only was it dominated by professionals, but it encouraged individualism and laziness. Football on the other hand demanded “too much manhood” to be a professional sport. (Clearly the editors of The Triangle did not see the NFL coming.) Teamwork was essential and success depended on the entire team doing well, not merely one or two-star players.
Still, the middle-class, native-born white Americans who most vocally supported amateurism, found an unease with football because of its violence. These proponents of amateurism were also the same progressives that decried business monopolies of the Gilded Age, and unfettered immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe to urban areas, and lynchings in the American South.
Generally in the progressive view, capitalism was good, but unbridled it could funnel all of society's wealth to a tiny few causing violent unrest. Immigrants could benefit America, but only in manageable quantities, otherwise the new Americans might overrun the country. Opposition to the extralegal mob violence of lynchings was balanced with admonitions that black Americans shouldn't do anything to “incite” lynching. Everywhere one looked in the progressive agenda, there was a tension to maintain an equilibrium that kept society away from perceived extremism.
Football slid quite capably into that tension. It was capable of doing good (promoting amateurism), but was susceptible to destroying those who played it, if left unchecked. In that December 1891 edition of The Triangle, there was a debate centered on whether football was, on balance, worthy of being played at YMCAs.
Opponents of football charged that the sport was too brutal. “Continually we hear of the slugging that is carried on, of the ungentlemanly conduct indulged in, and of the opportunities for the satisfaction of private spite that are afforded,” charged the opposition. Football, they continued, “is a modern gladiatorial fight, where many men are injured but not so many killed as formerly.”
Supporters of football dismissed brutality as not essential to the game, but as a result of “neglect of the umpire in enforcing the rules, which amply cover such cases.” “The game,” they insisted, “must be judged from those instances in which the rules are obeyed and not by those in which the rules are openly violated.”
Other arguments were offered up in the debate, which you can read, but the three-judge panel ruled in favor of the opposition by a score of 44 to 42. As the score indicates, it was not a clear-cut disavowal of football. Serving as one of the judges in this debate was James Naismith, so he was well aware of the pros and cons of the sport.
Over the next 20 years, many universities, colleges, high schools, and others held similar debates calling for a major reformation, if not outright ban, of the sport.
David Dayen of Politico described the violence pervading football of the era:
“'While this carnage did not prevent crowds from gathering and growing—ask any Roman emperor why—it worried several prominent leaders. “I saw a game of football last Saturday,” said Rep. Charles B. Landis of Indiana, brother of the future baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, in 1905. “There was not a boy in the game who did not run the risk of receiving an injury that would send him through life a hopeless cripple… dog fighting, cock fighting and bull fighting are Sabbath school games in comparison with modern football.'”
Ultimately, Teddy Roosevelt had to use the bully pulpit of the presidency in 1905 to instigate safety changes to the game, lest it be banned across the nation.
In 1910, Kansas University came close to abolishing football in favor of rugby, generally considered a less dangerous sport. At a mass student meeting supporting football, Naismith (now employed at Kansas) spoke out in favor of the beleaguered sport, saying he had “always believed that football [was] the typical college game.” Kansas and its fellow members of the Missouri Valley Conference voted to more heavily regulate football instead of abolishing it.
That Naismith would defend football is not surprising. He had played the sport back at the YMCA Training School alongside famed footballer Amos Alonzo Stagg. However, Naismith defending football from complete dismemberment isn't the same as a complete embrace of the sport.
Indeed, looking at his thought process behind creating basketball indicates that Naismith, like many others including President Roosevelt, may have admired football, but still found much to be expunged from the sport. Indeed, maybe a better sport could be made to maintain all of football's benefits without its crippling downside.
BASKETBALL'S SOLUTION
James Naismith died in 1939. Fortunately, he had finished his memoirs on creating basketball, Basketball: Its Origins and Development, which was published in 1941. The memoirs are an invaluable insight to the process Naismith went through in creating the sport.
Naismith's first attempt at creating an indoor winter sport, which eventually became basketball, involved modifying his students' favorite sport: football.
Naismith tried to eliminate the roughness of football by “substitut[ing] the tackling of English Rugby for that of the American game.” Naismith explained that “in Rugby, the tackle must be made above the hips, and the endeavor is to stop the runner rather than to throw him.” After trying the modified football with tamer tackling rules, an irritated Naismith reported that “the changing of the tackle did not appeal to the members of the class, who had been taught to throw the runner with as much force as possible… they would have none of it.”
Determined to prevent the viciousness of football in his nascent basketball, Naismith pondered why tackling was necessary in any sport. After contemplation he concluded, “It was because the men were allowed to run with the ball, and it was necessary to stop them… ‘If he can't run with the ball, we don't have to tackle; and if we don't have to tackle, the roughness will be eliminated.'”
Indeed Rule 5 of Naismith's original basketball rules expressly forbade “shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking, in any way the person of an opponent.” If this rule were violated, a foul would be called. In football, there might be wrong ways to shoulder, push, trip, etc., but in basketball none of those maneuvers were to be allowed without punishment.
In his memoirs, Naismith also reduced basketball down to five principles. The fourth principle seemed to be a direct indictment of the warlike setup of football. Principle 4 stated, “Both teams are to occupy the same area, yet there is to be no personal contact.” As we know, basketball can be a very physical sport. Indeed, the very first game—played by football enthusiasts remember—was a raucous affair, but Naismith's principle still holds. Both teams fully share the court space and when sudden contact is made, referees are forced to make a ruling on who is at fault.
A month after the first basketball game was played, Naismith published the first article about the sport in the January 1892 edition of The Triangle. Naismith in this earliest publication on basketball unequivocally declared, “It is intended that this game should be free from much of the reputed roughness of Rugby, and in framing of rules this has been kept strictly in view. If some of the rules seem unnecessarily severe, it will be remembered that the time to stop roughness is before it begins.
“The very men who are rough in playing will be the very first ones to oppose the game on this account,” accused Naismith.
What followed next was a statement so confident it bordered on bravado, something atypical for Naismith, as he denounced those who engaged in rough play. Indeed, the statement is so certain, it's hard to imagine its sentiment wasn't guiding Naismith all along as he tried to create a sport predicated on skill and teamwork, without the slugging and savagery of football.
“There is neither science nor skill taking a man unawares, and shoving him, or catching his arm and pulling him away, when he is about to catch the ball. A dog could do as much as that.”

Would Germany be Germany without Bavaria? The wealthy southern state comprises roughly one-fifth of Germany's landmass. It is the country's second-most populous state. Oktoberfest, lederhosen, sauerkraut? All Bavarian in origin.
Yet some Bavarians want nothing to do with Germany. The state is home to a pro-independence Bavaria Party, and one Bavarian man even filed a court case last year in an attempt to force a referendum on whether the state could vote to leave Germany.
But if 2016 was year of Brexit, 2017 is unlikely to be the year of “Bayxit” (in German, Bavaria is known as Bayern). On Monday, a German court released a decision saying that the country's constitution does not allow Bavaria to break away. There will be no referendum, the court said, because states are not allowed to leave Germany.
“In the Federal Republic of Germany … states are not ‘masters of the constitution,'” the court wrote in the decision, according to a translation from the Local. “Therefore there is no room under the constitution for individual states to attempt to secede. This violates the constitutional order.”
The news was met with a message of defiance from the pro-independence Bavaria Party, which posted on Facebook that the “struggle for Bavarian independence” would be decided not by a court bu “by the will of the Bavarian people.” The chairman of the party, Florian Weber, said that he expected the decision: When you want to drain the swamp, Weber reasoned, “you do not ask the frogs!”
Bavaria's independence movement isn't especially well-known, but it has a long history in the fiercely prideful region. Bavaria was for centuries one of the richest and most influential of the many smaller territories that made up the Holy Roman Empire. It was briefly an independent kingdom in the 19th century before it was incorporated into the newly unified Germany as a state in 1871. Even after unification, many Bavarians felt their home was closer to Catholic Austria than the Protestant Prussians who ruled the nascent empire.
Efforts to leave Germany continued for years without much success. After World War I, there was a short-lived attempt to form a Soviet Republic of Bavaria. Later, in 1923, Bavarian nationalists attempted to declare Bavaria independent and restore the Bavarian monarchy (that particular attempt failed in part because a right-wing agitator named Adolf Hitler tried to co-opt the uprising in what is now known as the Beer Hall Putsch).
After World War II, there was again a push for an independent Bavaria. The state was instead accepted as part of a federal Germany, but the independence movement didn't fully die down. The Bavaria Party earned considerable shares of the vote in the late 1940s and 1950s before fading from view.
Meanwhile, Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) became the only regional party with a major national voice, forming a union with the Christian Democratic Union — the party of current Chancellor Angela Merkel — in the German Bundestag (the CSU does not favor Bavarian independence).
Over the past few years, the independence movement has made a comeback of sorts. The movement has been aided not only by the growing clout of independence movements in Britain, Spain and elsewhere, but also the woes of the European Union that helped prompt Britain's “Brexit.” Many Bavarians feel they have to economically support not only weaker E.U. states but also poorer parts of Germany. The European refugee crisis, during which hundreds of thousands of migrants crossed into Germany through Bavaria, also fueled anger in the state, with Bavarian politicians quick to criticize Merkel for not doing more to stop refugees.
“Bavaria Can Also Go It Alone,” a book by a CSU-linked journalist, was published in 2012. The book argued that Bavaria's powerful economic and political status mean it should be independent “Maps are not set in stone for eternity,” author Wilfried Scharnagl once told Der Spiegel. “Who would have imagined, 25 years ago, that there would soon be a free Latvia, a free Estonia and a free Lithuania?”
But even if more people are talking about independence, it's unclear how many Bavarians are willing to vote for it. One survey from 2009 found that only 23 percent of Bavarians thought they might support independence. And while the Bavaria Party scored its best result in decades in 2013's local elections, that still amounted to just 2.1 percent of the vote.

Amitav Ghosh among 10 writers up for the £60,000 fiction award, while big names Karl Ove Knausgaard and Haruki Murakami don't make the cut
From the Guadeloupian novelist Maryse Condé to the French-Congolese writer Alain Mabanckou, a world-spanning shortlist for the Man Booker International prize will offer readers “an extraordinary variety of experiences”, according to chair of judges Marina Warner.
Announced on 24 March at the University of Cape Town, the 10-strong shortlist for the prestigious £60,000 award features eight writers in translation, and a new lineup of contenders, none of whom have previously been finalists for the prize. Six of the nationalities represented on the shortlist have never been included before: Mia Couto is the first author from Mozambique to make the final cut; Ibrahim Al-Koni the first from Libya; Condé the first from Guadeloupe; László Krasznahorkai the first from Hungary; Marlene van Niekerk the first from South Africa; and Mabanckou the first from Congo-Brazzaville.
India's Amitav Ghosh is arguably the best-known writer internationally to make the shortlist, which is completed with Lebanon's Hoda Barakat, Argentina's César Aira and US poet and writer Fanny Howe.

Karl Ove Knausgaard – feted and disparaged in equal parts in his native Norway, and now an enormous success in translation – was one big name to miss out on a place on the shortlist, as was the Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami. Bookmaker Paddy Power had given Harper Lee odds of 6/1 to win the prize, after it was announced that her second novel, Go Set a Watchman, would be released later this year, but judges will not yet have seen Lee's forthcoming work.
Awarded to a living author who has published fiction originally in English, or whose work is “generally” available in translation in English, the biennial Man Booker International prize has previously been won by North American writers three successive times: American short-story writer Lydia Davis was triumphant in 2013; American novelist Philip Roth in 2011 (somewhat controversially, after judge Carmen Callil resigned from the panel in protest at the decision); and the Canadian short story writer (and subsequent Nobel laureate) Alice Munro in 2009. The late Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe won in 2007, and the Albanian writer Ismail Kadare in 2005.
Academic and writer Marina Warner said the panel had “had an exhilarating experience reading for this prize”. She added: “We have ranged across the world and entered the vision of writers who offer an extraordinary variety of experiences.”

Warner echoed the sentiments of William Fiennes, chair of the Folio prize, who spoke earlier this year of how the novel is still “refreshing itself, reaching out for new shapes and strategies, still discovering what it might be, what it might do”. She said: “Fiction can enlarge the world for us all, and stretch our understanding and our sympathy.”
“The novel today is in fine form: as a field of inquiry, a tribunal of history, a map of the heart, a probe of the psyche, a stimulus to thought, a well of pleasure and a laboratory of language,” she added. “Truly, we feel closer to the tree of knowledge.”
Jonathan Taylor, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, praised a “most interesting and enlightening list of finalists”, and added: “It brings attention to writers from far and wide, so many of whom are in translation. As a result, our reading lists will surely be hugely expanded.”
New York Review Classics editorial director Edwin Frank, who joined Warner on the judging panel, admitted the judges had faced serious quantities of reading over the last year.
“It would be pretentious to say we wanted to survey the world, but we wanted to be mindful of the wider world of literature,” he said. “For me, I've learned all sorts of things about authors I'd never read... especially in Arabic literature, which is still woefully underrepresented in English. And we've various writers from Africa, writing in very different languages and literary traditions.”
Frank said he was “passionately concerned” with encouraging translation of literature into English. “This [judging process] has widened all our experiences on the panel, and happily so,” he said. “But I think this is a good moment, a better moment, for the life of books in translation in English. There are lots of small presses, in the UK and the US, such as And Other Stories, beginning to widen our horizons.”
The Man Booker International prize is awarded every two years to honour a writer's “achievement in fiction”. Authors cannot be put forward by their publishers; instead, the judging panel, with the help of an informal advisory network made up of past judges and winners, choose the top title.
As well as Warner and Frank, this year's panel features the novelist Nadeem Aslam, the writer and University of Oxford English professor Elleke Boehmer, and SOAS professor of Arabic and comparative literature Wen-chin Ouyang.
“It's heartening to see such a genuinely international list,” commented cultural journalist and critic Maya Jaggi. “Apart from Amitav Ghosh, many of these names may be unfamiliar to general readers in English. Yet most are towering figures in regional literatures - from Ibrahim al-Koni's starkly beautiful desert fables in Arabic to Maryse Conde's Caribbean classics in French. It's good to see writers who are pushing the boundaries of their languages, as well as serious comedy, represented - in the playful and savage satires of Alain Mabanckou in French and Marlene van Niekerk in Africaans.”
If a writer in translation wins the prize, the winner – to be announced on 19 May in London – can choose a translator of their work into English to receive an additional award of £15,000.

It wasn't always pretty for the Dallas Mavericks but they made it to the NBA playoffs. Dallas put a run together late in the year to earn a spot in the playoffs; they finished with the 6th seed. Waiting with the 3rd seed is the Oklahoma City Thunder and their dynamic duo of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant. Oklahoma City won the season series 4-0 over Dallas and the consensus expects the same results in the playoffs as well.
In order for Dallas to make this series competitive it will need to the following, easier said than done I know.
Stop Russell Westbrook. If you can't stop Westbrook, at least get in his way or something. Kevin Durant is the more polished player and the one destined for the Hall of Fame but Westbrook puts fear in your eyes. Westbrook is one of the best point guards in the world right now. He can slash to the hoop in a blink of an eye, or stop on a dime and drill a pull-up jumper. He'll even stare down the guard, almost admitting he's going to shoot, and drain a three right in their face.
Westbrook is a bad man, and the Mavericks only option is to let Wesley Matthews guard him and hope he misses. Hopefully Dallas conjures up a better plan, if not Westbrook will eat the Mavericks lunch.
The second key to victory is rebounding. OKC averages 49 rebounds per game compared to Dallas' 43, not far off but individually it's not close. Kevin Durant, Enes Kanter and Westbrook average 8 rebounds per game while Ibaka is just shy of them with 7. The Thunder's starters combine for 34 rebounds per game. Dallas starters only average 16 as a starting unit.
That can't happen in this series. Expect to see a heavy dose of Pachulia, Mejri and Powell in order to get the difference on the glass smaller. Based on game one success we'll see who Dallas will start at center going forward.
The final key for Dallas is simply Dirk. This Dirk shows he still has it and as long as Dirk still has it, you cannot count the Mavericks out. They have to get the ball to Dirk early and often, he has shown in the past that he can score on OKC, so use that. If Dirk does not score at least 25 in every game Dallas loses the series. They need Dirk.
The world seems set on OKC easing through this series but I would not close the door on Dallas just yet. After all, it is the NBA playoffs, anything can happen.
I was fortunate enough to be invited to a private dinner at marijuana icon Steve DeAngelo's house to celebrate his successful book launch. It was an amazing experience on many levels. The dinner was prepared by Jeff the 420 Chef, and it was mind blowing. The entire multi-course dinner was infused with cannabis, even the beverages.
Jeff is truly a talented guy, and it's no coincidence that he has been featured in so many media outlets. He is the best cannabis chef on the planet right now, and sent over a couple of recipes to post for Weed Newsreaders. The first is a cannabis infused sesame oil, which when prepared, can be used to make a number of things. It's a very versatile recipe, and is a healthier alternative to cannabis infused butter. If you like the recipe below (which you absolutely should), then you should pick up Jeff's new cookbook. It's PACKED with cannabis foodie goodness:
Number of servings: 8 1-tablespoon servings
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 4 hours + blanching and decarbing
Idle Time: 24-48 Hours plus overnight
Approximate THC per Serving*
10%: 30.5 milligrams
15%: 45.7 milligrams
20%: 61 milligrams
What You'll Need
Distilled water
Tea strainer
Medium/large-sized pot
Bowl filled with ice water
French press coffeemaker
Heat-resistant glass dish or baking tin
Aluminum foil
Glass jar
Ingredients
¼ ounce (7 grams) cannabis
3 ounces light or extra-light olive oil
2 ounces Sesame Oil
Steps
Step 1—Soak and Blanch Herb
Coarsely grind dry herb (also known as flower or bud) and soak in distilled water for 24-48 hours. Change the water every 12 hours. This cleans out a lot of the impurities that cause bad taste.
The next day, place “cleaned” herb in a tea strainer. Bring water to a boil in pot. Place tea strainer in boiling water for 5 minutes.
Immediately remove tea strainer after 5 minutes then place in bowl of ice water for 1 minute. Remove from ice water and pour distilled water over the tea strainer to rinse out any residual impurities. Remove herb from strainer and wring out excess water.
Step 2—Dry and Decarb
Spread cannabis evenly in a large baking pan and lay a large piece of aluminum foil loosely on top of it (i.e., don't crimp it down tightly around the edges). Let it sit overnight.
Your cannabis should be dry by the next morning. You can skip this step if you use a dehydrator.
When dry, preheat oven to 300ºF. Now, crimp down the foil and “bake” for 20 minutes. (This is how to decarb your cannabis.)
Remove from oven. Let sit for 5 minutes so THC or CBD vapors can settle back onto the herb. Remove foil and loosely cover with a couple of paper towels. This creates a dark environment with airflow.
Let pan sit, covered with paper towels, on the counter for 1-2 hours to dry out any residual moisture.
Note: Your final yield will weigh +/-20 to +/-50% less than your starting weight, depending on how moist or dry your cannabis was when you started the process.
Step 3—Infuse Oils
Pour both oils into a French press placed standing up in pot of simmering water. Mix decarbed cannabis to oil and cover the French press. Press plunger to just above the oil. This will be your water line.
Gently simmer (slow boil) for 4 hours. Check the water level every 20 minutes to ensure it is even with or slightly higher than the water line.
After 4 hours, remove the French press from the pot, push the plunger all the way down, and strain the oil into a clean jar. Your final yield should be about 4 ounces.
Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. To re-liquefy oil that has solidified, place oil container in a pot of hot water for 15 to 20 minutes.
*Approximate dose per serving is based on infusing 5 grams of cured/dried/decarbed cannabis into 5 ounces of oil.

The animal was a local legend among the people living in a protected area of southeastern Brazil's Atlantic rain forest. They reported sightings of a pure-white tapir, a piglike animal that's usually dark brown, roaming the area.
Such tales piqued the interest of National Geographic contributing photographer Luciano Candisani, who wanted to capture the ghostly beast on film. (Also see "New Tapir Discovered—One of The Biggest Mammals Found This Century.")
So, in May 2014, Candisani traveled to one of the odd tapir's reported hangouts in the Votorantim Reserve and waited for the nocturnal animal under the cover of darkness. Many tapirs came by, but no white ones. Undeterred, the photographer set up a camera trap, which takes a picture whenever something passes in front of it.
"My heart skipped a beat when, while reviewing the photos from one night, the white tapir suddenly appeared in one of the frames," says Candisani.
It's the first known photo taken of an albino lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) in the wild.
Pull Quote The threatened Atlantic Forest can still hold many surprises for science. Luciano Candisani, National Geographic contributing photographer
Tapirs in Trouble
Albinism occurs when an animal is born with a naturally occurring, but rare, genetic mutation. True albinos, like this tapir, lack all pigments and have white fur and reddish-pink eyes. (Related: "Pictures: Special Albinos and Unusually White Animals.")
Albino tapirs are very rare in their South American rain forest habitat. Tapirs, which grow up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) long and weigh 550 pounds (225 kilograms), are the biggest Brazilian land mammals—even bigger than the jaguar.
Watch a video of a related species, the Baird tapir.
The shy, solitary herbivores are also known for their flexible, trunk-like snouts, which are able to grip leaves and fruits on high branches. Tapirs even use their long snouts as snorkels while swimming—they're strong swimmers and often take to the water to cool off or escape predators.
But they haven't been able to outrun threats such as hunting and deforestation, which have dwindled the populations of all four living tapir species, including the Malayan tapir of Southeast Asia. In Brazil, 85 percent of the Atlantic rain forest has been destroyed, according to the Nature Conservancy.
Tapirs are crucial in the forest ecosystem—as they move through the area, they deposit seeds in their droppings.
Lucky Shot
Candisani said he feels lucky to have photographed such a rare and elusive animal.
Since photographing the albino tapir, Candisani has set up more camera traps in the area and captured images of other little-seen South American creatures, such the bush dog. (Also see "Mysterious Bush Dogs to Be Bred: Behind the Elusive Species.")
"The threatened Atlantic Forest," he says, "can still hold many surprises for science."
The story about the albino tapir appeared in the April issue of National Geographic Brazil.

Gun owners are right to resist handing over their lawfully purchased high-capacity magazines.
As of yesterday evening, all that stands between the state of California and the criminalization of thousands of previously law-abiding state citizens is the opinion of a single federal judge. In a 66-page order, Judge Roger Benitez temporarily blocked a new California law that required citizens to surrender possession of any gun magazine capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition.

Remember how gun-controllers mock conservatives who claim that progressives really want to confiscate lawfully owned weapons? Well, someone forgot to tell California progressives to hide their radical cards. Last year the state amended its criminal law. It already banned the sale and transfer of large-capacity magazines. The new law applied to those magazines that were grandfathered in, legally possessed under previous law. As of July 1, 2017, any person who keeps a lawfully purchased and lawfully possessed large-capacity magazine risks a fine and up to one year in a county jail. Or, to quote the judge, “On July 1, 2017, any previously law-abiding person in California who still possesses a firearm magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds will begin their new life of crime.”
The law, however, does play favorites. It exempts “active and retired law enforcement officers” (but not members of the military), “employees of armored car businesses,” and — incredibly — “movie and television actors when magazines are used as a prop.” Not even social justice can stop the Hollywood gravy train.
Advertisement
The little people, however, have but three choices: take the magazine out of the state (I'll gladly accept donations to my Tennessee stash), sell it to a licensed firearm dealer, or surrender it to law enforcement for destruction. To absolutely no one's surprise, gun owners appear to be resisting the law. A Sacramento Bee report summarizes their mood: “Talk to gun owners, retailers and pro-gun sheriffs across California and you'll get something akin to an eye roll when they're asked if gun owners are going to voluntarily part with their property because Democratic politicians and voters who favor gun control outnumber them and changed the law.”
The Bee quoted UCLA professor Adam Winkler who noted that gun owners tend to “ignore” magazine bans. “We see no compliance from gun owners,” he said. “As best as we can tell, no gun owners are giving up their high capacity magazines or selling them out of state.”

In fact, blue-state gun owners are becoming known for their passive resistance. When Connecticut required registration of so-called assault weapons, as few as 15 percent of assault-weapon owners complied.
Thanks to Judge Benitez, California's gun owners have a brief reprieve. His opinion should be required reading for anyone who seeks to understand the meaning and purpose of the Second Amendment. Judge Benitez, quite simply, “gets it,” and his opinion is a tour de force that not only critiques Ninth Circuit jurisprudence (even as he applies it), it also eviscerates claims that California's ban will have any meaningful impact on public safety.
The law's advocates claim that large-capacity magazines don't have “legitimate self-defense value.” Judge Benitez responds with actual evidence of their use in self-defense. The law's advocates claim that studies of mass shootings show that large-capacity magazines render mass shootings particularly dangerous. Judge Benitez takes apart those studies, showing that the impact of large-capacity magazines is exaggerated and that the evidence is woefully deficient that banning them would have any meaningful impact on public safety:
To sum up, of the 92 mass killings occurring across the 50 states between 2013 and 2009, only ten occurred in California. Of those ten, the criminalization and dispossession requirements of section 32310 of the new law would have had no effect on eight of the shootings, and only marginal good effects had it been in effect at the time of the remaining two shootings. On this evidence, section 32310 is not a reasonable fit. It hardly fits at all. It appears on this record to be a haphazard solution likely to have no effect on an exceedingly rare problem, while at the same time burdening the constitutional rights of other California law-abiding responsible citizen-owners of gun magazines holding more than ten rounds.
Advertisement
Moreover, the Court directly addresses a vital purpose of the Second Amendment — that it stands as a firewall against tyranny. If a state removes effective, commonly used weaponry from public use, that firewall starts to crumble. This summary paragraph is near-perfect:
Violent gun use is a constitutionally-protected means for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from criminals. The phrase “gun violence” may not be invoked as a talismanic incantation to justify any exercise of state power. Implicit in the concept of public safety is the right of law-abiding people to use firearms and the magazines that make them work to protect themselves, their families, their homes, and their state against all armed enemies, foreign and domestic. To borrow a phrase, it would indeed be ironic if, in the name of public safety and reducing gun violence, statutes were permitted to subvert the public's Second Amendment rights — which may repel criminal gun violence and which ultimately ensure the safety of the Republic.

The case will move quickly to the Ninth Circuit, where gun owners' prospects are more grim. Ninth Circuit case law is hopelessly convoluted. Indeed, it seems deliberately engineered to provide maximum flexibility to progressive state and local governments while still providing a veneer of judicial review. One hopes that the Supreme Court will break its recent habit of refusing to review gun cases and step in once again on the side of the Bill of Rights.
As I've written before, California is seceding from the Constitution. It is systematically attacking individual liberty in favor of secular progressive collectivism. First Amendment rights are already under comprehensive assault, and now it seeks to cross the Second Amendment Rubicon — moving from gun “control” to outright confiscation of previously lawfully owned magazines.
Gun owners are right to resist this law. The court was right to block it. As Judge Benitez noted, if he didn't enjoin the statute, then “hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of otherwise law-abiding citizens will have an untenable choice: become an outlaw or dispossess one's self of lawfully acquired property. That is a choice they should not have to make. Not on this record.” To that I would simply add, not under this Constitution. California's law cannot stand.

India will launch an advanced communications satellite (GSAT-6) in July or August for strategic applications, its space agency chief said today."We will launch GSAT-6 for strategic applications in July-end or August beginning, with a special antenna that will have a capability to use a handheld device to communicate from anywhere," Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman AS Kiran Kumar told reporters in Bengaluru.ISRO will use a heavy rocket - geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLVA Mark II) to launch the 2-tonne GSAT-6 with 10 special transponders from its spaceport at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh."The six-metre diameter antenna will be one of the scientific instruments onboard the satellite. We are making optical instruments for measurements using optimal techniques," Mr Kiran Kumar said on the margins of a function.The instruments are also used in telescopes of 1.2 metre and 0.7 metre mirrors, which are measured to nanometer accuracy.Though the space agency was to launch the satellite earlier for the city-based Devas Multimedia Services Ltd under a pact with its commercial arm Antrix Corporation, the government cancelled the $300 million deal in February 2011 invoking sovereignty and decided to use it for strategic needs.Under the annulled deal, Antrix was to lease transponders of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A to Devas for allowing it to offer digital multimedia services using S-band wavelength (spectrum), reserved for strategic use of the country. Earlier, the ISRO chief flagged off a three-day seminar, symposium and expo on metrology at the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI), organised by the Metrology Society of India, southern region on the occasion of 'World Metrology Day', celebrated on May 20.
So I go to a wonderful church called Soma. It's full of people who try to love Jesus and each other, and although they are often messy at it, there is some really beautiful stuff that happens there.
In a recent service, my pastor said something incredibly profound, and I want to share it with you.
He said that many people know that it's good to listen to yourself---you should try to understand and acknowledge the way that you are feeling. (Indeed, my section on empathy talks about this in depth.)
But it's also good to talk to yourself, because sometimes you need to speak truth to yourself.
Sometimes your emotions will be saying that you are a screw-up or that nothing matters, and you need to speak into that and remind yourself of all the people who love you and all of the good things in your life.
Sometimes your anger will be saying that another person is worth your hate, and you need to remind yourself the answer to anger is not hate but love.
Sometimes your anxiety will tell you that terrible things will happen if you try to accomplish your goals, and you need to tell yourself that your fear is lying to you.
Speak truth to yourself today. You are an incredible, brave, beautiful person, and life holds so much promise for you. Don't let fear or depression or loneliness or anger blind you to the truth of who you are.
And hey.
Maybe speak truth to someone else, too.
Remind them that you care about them, and tell them about the greatness you see in them. Tell them that you are grateful to have them in your life, and tell them that they matter. Everyone needs to be reminded that they are loved and that they matter, so give that gift to someone today.
And don't be afraid to ask for that gift from someone else. If you're feeling weighed down, tell someone you need to talk. If it's too hard to speak truth to yourself, tell someone else how you're doing, and ask them to help encourage you.
We all need each other, amigos, and we all belong somewhere. Hold on to the truth of that.
The housing market has been on a tear lately. Below I'll review recent price changes, what's been driving them and what we can expect in the near future.
Home prices (as measured by the median price per square foot) are up strongly for the year to date through April, by around 9 percent for detached homes and 10 percent for condos. Here's a look at the price per square foot since the March 2009 trough:
Note that the yellow line denoting condos exhibits some pretty wild swings. For that reason, I like to focus more on the much steadier detached home figure in red, which shows a fairly consistent rise in recent times.
It's possible that the median price per square foot could be overstating price increases a little if there has been a “quality shift” wherein people are on average buying nicer homes. (We won't know for sure until the release of the Case-Shiller index, which mitigates the quality-shift issue by measuring same-hole sales — here's an old-timey article on the subject of measuring home prices for those interested in going down the rathole).
Regardless, it's clear that a strong uptrend in home prices has been under way for a while now.
Here's a look at the same price data starting at the peak of the housing bubble in 2005:
Fairly robust housing demand has certainly helped prices:
However, much more significant has been the exceedingly low level of supply:
This graph, which shows supply on a single line going back to 2007, shows how dramatic the decline in for-sale inventory has been:
We can combine supply and demand into a single figure by measuring months of inventory (the number of months it would take to sell all the currently available inventory at the current pace of sales). Thanks to a combination of fairly strong demand and extremely low supply, the months of inventory figure has plummeted:
Inventory got as high as about 15 months during the housing bust. Now it stands at under two months.
The reason I am so interested in months of inventory is that it has historically been highly correlated with price changes, and thus can provide a clue as to where prices may go in the near term. This is demonstrated in the following graph, which shows months of inventory in blue and monthly home price changes in red. (Inventory has been inverted, such that high inventory appears low on the graph and vice-versa, to make the correlation more clear).
The inventory decline that started in early 2012 hinted at the price increases to come. Since then, months of inventory has dropped relentlessly, recently hitting a new low in the history of the data I have. If the typical relationship between months of supply and home prices remains intact, we can expect further upward price pressure in the months immediately ahead.

The free agency wish list for Jared Allen was a relatively simple one; the veteran defensive end wanted to be fairly compensated in his next contract, and he wanted to play for a Super Bowl contender.
No discounts. No finishing up his career for an NFL bottom-dweller.
More than two weeks into free agency, Allen finally found the right combination of money and title opportunity—and it came from an unlikely source.
According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Allen and the Chicago Bears agreed to a four-year deal worth $32 million, with $15.5 million guaranteed and a voidable fourth year. Essentially, the deal is for three years and $24 million, of which almost two-thirds is fully guaranteed:
While Allen didn't get the $10 million per season DeMarcus Ware landed with the Denver Broncos, he did receive a deal from the Bears that presented fair value and was in line with other top pass-rushers.
Lamarr Houston, who signed with the Bears on the first day of free agency, agreed to a five-year deal worth $35 million, with $15 million guaranteed. Julius Peppers inked a three-year, $26 million deal with the Green Bay Packers, but he was only guaranteed $7.5 million, less than half of what Allen landed in Chicago.
Overall, Allen's deal ranks fourth among other deals received by free-agent defensive ends this offseason in terms total money, with only Michael Johnson ($43.75 million), Houston ($35 million) and Arthur Jones ($33 million) signing for more.
Ware's deal in Denver was for three years and $30 million, with $20 million guaranteed.

But if Allen's only motivation was to chase the cash, he would have landed in Oakland.
According to NFL.com's Ian Rapoport, the Raiders offered Allen a deal worth $9 million per season. Full contract details, including length and guaranteed money, were not provided. But it can be safely assumed that the cash-loaded Raiders could have matched Chicago's $15.5 million guaranteed and then some.
Money obviously wasn't Allen's only desire. But chasing a Super Bowl on a deal he didn't deem worthy wasn't a very palatable option, either. In fact, Rapoport reported early in free agency that Allen would consider retirement if a fair offer didn't come his way.
Whether those were hollow threats or not, we'll never know. However, Allen's decision not to sign in Seattle speaks for itself.
The Seahawks always seemed like one of the more likely landing spots for Allen, given their affinity for stockpiling pass-rushers and their ability to immediately contend for another Super Bowl title. If Allen truly wanted to get a ring before retiring, the talent-rich Seahawks presented the best opportunity for him to do so.
And Allen did his due diligence, making two separate visits to the Pacific Northwest, per ESPN's Ed Werder, forcing many to speculate that an agreement between the two was in the works. At one point, it looked like a near certainty that the Seahawks would land Allen to help terrorize opposing quarterbacks in 2014.
The deal never happened.
The Seahawks likely had no interest in paying Allen $8 million or more per season. If he was going to play in Seattle, it was going to be a on a team-friendly deal, well below what Allen believed he was worth.
Nothing against Allen, a 10-year veteran with 128.5 career sacks. Just business.

“He's a prideful man,” Seahawks general manager John Schneider said, via Nick Eaton of the Seattle Press-Intelligencer. “He's accomplished a lot in this league, so anything that we were able to offer was not out of disrespect or anything. It was just trying to fit the pieces together.”
When the Bears jumped into the discussion with $8 million per year and an improving roster, Allen's decision became much easier. The mechanics of the deal happened quickly.
As first reported by national writer Brian McIntyre on Monday, the Bears converted $5 million of Jay Cutler's $22.5 million base salary into a signing bonus, creating the necessary cap room for general manager Phil Emery to acquire Allen. Cutler's contract was crafted to give Emery the ability for just this kind of move.
Less than two days later, Allen was signed, sealed and delivered.
The Bears roster suddenly seems much closer to a Super Bowl than it did when Aaron Rodgers floated a game-winning pass to Randall Cobb to knock Chicago out of the playoffs during the final week of the regular season.
Gone are Peppers, Henry Melton, Josh McCown and Devin Hester, but the Bears have rebuilt the defensive line with Houston, a noted run-stopper capable of playing end and tackle; Willie Young, arguably the biggest steal of free agency; and Allen, a respected veteran with seven straight seasons of double-digit sacks.
If the draft can solve a major issue at safety, while also bringing in another attacking 3-technique and youth at cornerback, the Bears historically poor defense from 2013 will be on the fast track toward improvement next season.
And there's no doubt Allen looked at the Bears offense and saw a unit capable of advancing deep into the postseason.
Cutler returns on a massive deal to lead an offense that averaged 27.8 points per game, the second highest average in the NFL in 2013. He has weapons all around him.
Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery represent the most physically dominant (and arguably most talented) pair of receivers in the game, Martellus Bennett is a rock at tight end and Matt Forte might be the most productive but under-appreciated running back in the NFL. Throw in an offensive line that took a quantum leap in protecting the quarterback in 2013, and the Bears have all the ingredients necessary to produce another high-scoring offense.
Chicago finished 8-8 last season, including just 2-4 over its final six games. A chance to win the NFC North outright was squandered not once, but twice, as the Philadelphia Eagles ran over the Bears in Week 16 before the Packers stole the division in the dying moments of the season finale.
However, this is a team whose arrow is pointed straight up, especially if Emery can deliver an impact draft class come May. Under Marc Trestman, the Bears should enter next season as a real contender to win the division and make the postseason, where anything can happen once a team punches its ticket to the dance.
For Allen, the situation is an ideal one.
The money is fair, and his new roster is playoff worthy. Playing in the NFC North, a division he's tormented for the last six years, is just an added bonus.
It took him longer than expected, but Allen finally found the right combination of answers in Chicago.

Refined sugar is one of the worst things found in the Western diet. Back in January, this blog covered the release of a major report from ‘Action on Sugar', which stated that the obesity epidemic could be reversed if, on average, each person ate 100 fewer calories of refined sugar per day (1). For example, with half of the U.S. population drinking sugar drinks on any given day (2), and a 330 mL can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi clocking in at 9 tsp of sugar (139 calories), removing soft drinks alone could make a huge difference.
On 5 March 2014, the World Health Organization updated their global sugar intake guidelines (3). The existing guidelines, developed in 2002, were that sugars should make up no more than 10% of total energy (calorie) intake per day. The new WHO draft guideline proposes a further reduction limiting sugars to be below 5% of daily energy intake (3). For a person of a health body mass index (BMI), 5% of daily energy intake would be around 6 teaspoons of sugar (3). For comparison, this table shows the amount of sugar that are ‘hidden' in common processed foods.
The WHO has stated:
There is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, may result in both reduced intake of foods containing more nutritionally adequate calories and an increase in total caloric intake, leading to an unhealthy diet, weight gain, and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases (3).
The new sugar intake guidelines is a rough draft at this point and the WHO is inviting public consultation from 5 to 31 March 2014. This page has the information necessary for those members of the public who are interested in providing comments to the WHO on the new draft guidelines (4). This is the chance for members of the public to give input on policy that may have a wide effect on populations.
The proposed sugar intake is less than a can of Coke per day (5). I believe this is perfectly advisable to anyone wanting to improve their health, but is in practical terms, is it realistic? The guidelines, when taken as personal health advice, might be unrealistic for some people as sugar-laden processed foods such as soda are readily available, the food industry spends millions on advertising these foods to us, and drinking Coke and eating processed foods is often a social norm. Is it right to put the onus on individuals for their dietary behaviour when personal food intake is so heavily influenced by the external environment? A person would have to be terribly health conscious and strong willed to nearly eliminate sugar from their diet when it is so easy to access.
Regardless of any initial teething problems (sorry, I had to), these new guidelines are a positive step forward in improving the nutritional value of food systems. The WHO suggests that the new guidelines can be used by policymakers to ‘assess current levels of free sugars relative to a benchmark and develop measures to decrease intake of free sugars, where necessary, through public health interventions'. These actions are needed and would be beneficial. However, reducing the content of added, refined sugar by the food industry itself is another crucial step that must be taken in addition to health sector intervention. Hopefully the new sugar intake guidelines can be a stepping stone for health policy and the food industry to move forward together in reducing refined sugars in processed foods.
Managers in different parts of the world are conditioned to give feedback in drastically different ways. If you're working with international clients or business partners, it's important – but difficult – to gauge how a culture handles negativity. One way to do this is by listening to the types of words people use. More direct cultures often use upgraders, words preceding or following negative feedback that make it feel stronger (like “absolutely” or “totally”). Germans and the Dutch have direct cultures. By contrast, indirect cultures use downgraders, words that soften the criticism (“kind of,” “slightly”). Downgrading includes deliberate understatements, like saying “We are not quite there yet” when you really mean “This is nowhere close to complete.” Indirect cultures can be found in the US and Britain. Misunderstanding someone's intention – or being misunderstood – can cause offense and unintended actions, so it's important to learn the culture behind the feedback in order to respond correctly.
I had been holed up for six hours in a dark conference room with 12 managers. It was a group-coaching day and each executive had 30 minutes to describe in detail a cross-cultural challenge she was experiencing at work and to get feedback and suggestions from the others at the table.
It was Willem's turn, one of the Dutch participants, who recounted an uncomfortable snafu when working with Asian clients. “How can I fix this relationship?” Willem asked his group of international peers.
Maarten, the other Dutch participant who knew Willem well, jumped in with his perspective. “You are inflexible and can be socially ill-at-ease. That makes it difficult for you to communicate with your team,” he asserted. As Willem listened, I could see his ears turning red (with embarrassment or anger? I wasn't sure) but that didn't seem to bother Maarten, who calmly continued to assess Willem's weaknesses in front of the entire group. Meanwhile, the other participants — all Americans, British and Asians — awkwardly stared at their feet.
That evening, we had a group dinner at a cozy restaurant. Entering a little after the others, I was startled to see Willem and Maarten sitting together, eating peanuts, drinking champagne, and laughing like old friends. They waved me over, and it seemed appropriate to comment, “I'm glad to see you together. I was afraid you might not be speaking to each other after the feedback session this afternoon.”
Willem, with a look of surprise, reflected, “Of course, I didn't enjoy hearing those things about myself. It doesn't feel good to hear what I have done poorly. But I so much appreciated that Maarten would be transparent enough to give me that feedback honestly. Feedback like that is a gift. Thanks for that, Maarten” he added with an appreciative smile.
I thought to myself, “This Dutch culture is . . . well . . . different from my own.”
Managers in different parts of the world are conditioned to give feedback in drastically different ways. The Chinese manager learns never to criticize a colleague openly or in front of others, while the Dutch manager learns always to be honest and to give the message straight. Americans are trained to wrap positive messages around negative ones, while the French are trained to criticize passionately and provide positive feedback sparingly.
One way to begin gauging how a culture handles negative feedback is by listening to the types of words people use. More direct cultures tend to use what linguists call upgraders, words preceding or following negative feedback that make it feel stronger, such as absolutely, totally, or strongly: “This is absolutely inappropriate,” or “This is totally unprofessional.”
By contrast, more indirect cultures use more downgraders, words that soften the criticism, such as kind of, sort of, a little, a bit, maybe, and slightly. Another type of downgrader is a deliberate understatement, such as “We are not quite there yet” when you really mean “This is nowhere close to complete.” The British are masters at it. The “Anglo-Dutch Translation Guide”, which has been circulating in various versions on the Internet, illustrates the miscommunication that can result.
Germans are rather like the Dutch in respect of directness and interpret British understatement very similarly. Marcus Klopfer, a German client, described to me how a misunderstanding with his British boss almost cost him his job:
In Germany, we typically use strong words when complaining or criticizing in order to make sure the message registers clearly and honestly. Of course, we assume others will do the same. My British boss during a one-on-one “suggested that I think about” doing something differently. So I took his suggestion: I thought about it, and decided not to do it. Little did I know that his phrase was supposed to be interpreted as “change your behavior right away or else.” And I can tell you I was pretty surprised when my boss called me into his office to chew me out for insubordination! I learned to ignore all of the soft words surrounding the message when listening to my British teammates. Of course, the other lesson was to consider how my British staff might interpret my messages, which I had been delivering as “purely” as possible with no softeners whatsoever. I realize now that when I give feedback in my German way, I may actually use words that make the message sound as strong as possible without thinking much about it. I've been surrounded by this “pure” negative feedback since I was a child.
All this can be interesting, surprising, and sometimes downright painful, when you are leading a global team: as you Skype with your employees in different cultures, your words will be magnified or minimized significantly based on your listener's cultural context So you have to work to understand how your own way of giving feedback is viewed in other cultures. As Klopfer reported:
Now that I better understand these cultural tendencies, I … soften the message when working with cultures less direct than my own. I start by sprinkling the ground with a few light positive comments and words of appreciation. Then I ease into the feedback with “a few small suggestions.” As I'm giving the feed- back, I add words like “minor” or “possibly.” Then I wrap up by stating that “This is just my opinion, for whatever it is worth,” and “You can take it or leave it.” The elaborate dance is quite humorous from a German's point of view … but it certainly gets [the] desired results!
What about you? Where do you think your own culture falls in this regard? If I need to tell you your work is total crap, how would you like me to deliver the message?
The Irish economy is to continue to enjoy strong growth over the next 18 months, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute.
In its latest Quarterly Economic Commentary, the ESRI says Ireland's gross domestic product will grow by 4.4% this year and 3.7% in 2016.
This is on par with predictions the institute made in March of this year, and ahead of forecasts from the Government, Central Bank and European Commission.
The institute also expects the unemployment situation to improve further, with unemployment to fall to 9.7% this year and 8.4% in 2016.
The ESRI says despite sluggishness internationally, the Irish economy should continue to recover.
This is due to an improvement in the domestic economy, which it says will make a major contribution to growth in the coming year and a half.
However, the ESRI has warned that the Government should not "loosen the purse strings" too much when it comes to this year's Budget.
Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Kieran McQuinn, Associate Research Professor with the ESRI, said that if the predictions come true, Ireland will have the strongest growing economy in Europe.
He said in this situation the Government should avoid seeking to further stimulate the economy.
"If you think the economy is doing very, very well, which we think it will over the next few years, then there isn't really a need for the Government to get involved and to seek to stimulate the economy.
"The more advisable course of action is certainly in the short term to let things be as they are, to follow a neutral strategy and that should over the longer period of time ensure that we have more stable public finances and a more sustainable set of fiscal objectives."
Texas has won six straight against overmatched opponents, but it's about to get real. No. 12 Oklahoma State will be the best team we've played this year. They opened as a 3-point road favorite and the margin will probably get bigger. We just lost our starting running back and a defensive tackle for the season. So what can we do?
OSU's offense has ranked in the top 10 in yards per game five of the last six years. The good news is they're averaging almost 100 fewer yards per game this year compared with last year. The bad news is they're still scoring plenty of points.
Personnel
The Cowboys' offense has changed some over the course of the season. Since senior quarterback Clint Chelf took over for J.W. Walsh, OK State's run game has somewhat moved away from the read option and QB draws, though Chelf is a capable runner. Don't be fooled by Chelf's completion percentage (50.7%) — he throws a great spiral, is usually accurate and has a strong arm. OSU has had a lot of dropped passes and only an average rushing attack.
The OSU run game is led by 6'2" 210-pound junior Desmond Roland. He's not fast but he doesn't go down easily. There's also Jeremy Smith, who is similar to Roland stylistically, and true freshman Rennie Childs (5'10" 180 lbs.). Childs has seen most of his limited action late in games, but his speed gives OSU the best chance to run outside the tackles.
With Chelf taking snaps, OSU's run game has revolved around split zone and outside zone. Sometimes Roland and Smith are both in the backfield, but often there's a fullback. (Side note: Senior fullback Kye Staley hasn't been great in the games I've seen, but he was a beast against us last year.) Expect to see OSU test us on the edge with outside zone early and often. I don't think they'll have much success running between the tackles unless they're able to spread us out with four-wide sets.
In the passing game, Tracy Moore is this year's big OSU WR. The senior is 6'2" 215 lbs. and runs in the 4.55 to 4.60 range. Moore lines up in the slot and almost plays like a flex TE at times. I expect we'll put Adrian Phillips on him whenever we can. After Moore, there's redshirt freshman WR Jhajuan Seales (6'2" 185 lbs.) and senior Charlie Moore (6'2" 202 lbs.). Both play outside — Seales is probably a step or two faster than Tracy Moore, and though the other Moore doesn't get a ton of looks, his size gave TCU's Jason Verrett fits on a couple of plays.
One bit of news to watch will be the status of junior slot receiver Josh Stewart. Stewart is OSU's big-play guy, sort of mash-up of Jaxon Shipley and Daje Johnson. After spraining an ankle against Kansas last week, it seems unlikely that Stewart will play; if he does, he won't be 100%. Instead, we should see David Glidden, a scrappy gym rat-type, in the slot. He doesn't look like an easy matchup, but I trust that Quandre Diggs can limit his big plays.
The offensive line has been shaky, but after a few changes it looks like it's improving. Due to injuries, they switched junior Daniel Koenig from right to left tackle. Koenig appears to be the weakest link on the line, and his backup on the right side has had his struggles, at least in pass protection, as well. OSU hasn't given up many sacks, but if you've seen Texas play in the past few weeks I don't need to tell you that problems at the tackle position are a disaster waiting to happen.
The Game Plan
OSU will want to attack our linebackers. We'll see mostly two-back or four-wide (likely 3x1) sets. I think Gerg will keep us in mostly 4-3 and occasionally nickel personnel with Phillips in the box, playing lots of three-deep zone (Cover 3) and man coverage with one deep safety (Cover 1). We'll probably tend toward Cover 3 since, unlike most of the QBs we've faced this year, Chelf can actually throw deep and has big receivers on the other end, but OSU really struggled with Cover 1 in the games I saw. I hope we challenge their receivers, especially since (aside from Stewart) they aren't really the type to run by you, but don't be surprised if we're giving up the quick game like we did vs. WVU.
The primary way OSU will attack us in the passing game is with play-action passes to the seams and slants to the outside.
On this play, Tech brings a safety into the box and is blitzing all three linebackers. With one deep safety, the corners are playing loose, and the play-action freezes the underneath defenders. This is almost the exact look we were in when a West Virginia receiver took a slant 72 yards against Duke Thomas.
The safety is still near the line after the fake and Seales is breaking on the slant. If the corner misses the tackle — which is very possible considering Seales' size — and the free safety takes a poor angle, this is going to the house. Tech is fortunate on this play that the blitz doesn't get picked up and the ball is batted at the line.

OSU will also use Stewart or, if he can't go, Glidden to attack the edge with screens and then use the threat of that to throw to the seam.
In this game against West Virginia, Stewart is the No. 2 receiver in a 3x1 set. Tracy Moore is lined up as No. 3, and although it doesn't matter on this play, that's Seales in a one-on-one matchup at the bottom. Stewart is going to run a bubble screen while Moore and the No. 1 receiver fake like they're going to block. Meanwhile, WVU rotates the coverage to the trips side to address the threat of the screen. This was a change-up to their usual adjustment to trips.
Rather than block, No. 1 and No. 3 blow past the defenders while Walsh pump-fakes to Stewart. Walsh anticipates Moore breaking free behind the DB and throws his way. There's a safety over the top but he isn't going to make this play, and even if he gets a good break on the ball, Moore is a big man to be stealing a pass from. On this particular play you can see why Walsh was benched, but you also see a big reason Chelf hasn't been completing more passes — the throw isn't good, but Moore also drops it. Let's hope we get the same results.
via www.freegifhub.com
One last concept we'll almost certainly see once or twice when we're in man coverage is the rail route from the backfield.
You might remember this from OU's first drive in the Red River Shootout — Brennan Clay beat Steve Edmond to the end zone and dropped the easy touchdown.
The WR will run a slant or hitch to try to pick the LB, but even without the pick, Edmond or Dalton Santos on any back running down the sideline is not a desirable matchup, especially if they use Childs here. Unless the corner sees it coming and can break off in pursuit, this won't go well for us. It didn't go well for Kansas either.
via www.freegifhub.com
Assuming we're going to continue to base out of single-high coverages, I like Cover 1 over Cover 3 in this game. I'm not worried about OSU's receivers blowing past Byndom or Thomas; I've seen them struggle to get off tight man coverage; I like our ability to disrupt throws with man pressure; and I don't want Seales or Moore — either one — catching easy passes with a cushion against our inexperienced (Thomas) and comparatively undersized corners. That said, we're probably going to run a ton of Cover 3.
I don't expect OSU to have success running inside. They could try their diamond package, but I think that just plays to our strengths inside. Instead I expect them to try to attack the edge. Any success there will increase the effect of play-action on our already slow linebackers, widening the holes in Cover 3. We're probably going to give up a few big plays in the passing game. Their receivers, save Glidden, all will have a height advantage and will probably win a jump ball or two, and there's a good chance we'll miss a tackle at some point on the outside. Still, Chelf, though he is a competent passer, has shown he'll predetermine where he's going and will force throws. It's also a safe bet we'll continue the trend of having at least one big play a week off fire zone blitzes. If we can use pressure to force some bad throws, tackle well in the secondary and maybe get another strip-sack, we'll be in good shape — but I don't expect OSU to score less than 27 points (though I'm expecting a special teams or defensive touchdown). I'll discuss our chances of also scoring more than 27 points later this week.
Abu Sayaf militants release former Italian priest Rolando Del Torchio from captivity in Philippines
Posted
A retired Italian priest held hostage for six months by Islamist militants has left a Philippines hospital a day after his release, looking frail although officials say he is in good health.
Key points: Rolando Del Torchio was found in a ferry docked on Jolo island on Friday
Not immediately clear if a ransom was paid for his release
Friday deadline for ransom on other hostages passes without word on their fate
A thin Rolando Del Torchio waved to journalists as he walked to a waiting ambulance after spending the night in a military hospital in the southern port of Zamboanga.
"The victim is emaciated. He has lost a lot of weight compared to what we saw in his old pictures," regional military spokesman Major Filemon Tan said.
"He is OK otherwise."
The Italian was held captive by the Abu Sayyaf group after armed men snatched the then 56-year-old at gunpoint at his pizza restaurant in the southern city of Dipolog in October last year.
"The ASG was behind this kidnapping," Major Tan said, referring to the group by its initials.
It was not clear where Father Del Torchio was headed, but the military spokesman said the Italian embassy had arranged for a chartered plane to fly him out of Zamboanga.
Philippine authorities found Father Del Torchio late on Friday aboard a ferry docked on the remote southern island of Jolo, the main Abu Sayyaf stronghold, located around 950 kilometres south of Manila.
Abu Sayyaf still holding foreign hostages
The Abu Sayyaf is a small group of Islamic militants infamous for kidnapping foreigners and demanding huge ransoms, as well as for being behind deadly bombings in the mainly Catholic Asian nation.
Its leaders have in recent years pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group that controls vast swathes of Iraq and Syria.
Major Tan said he did not know if any ransom was paid to secure Father Del Torchio's release.
Father Del Torchio had worked as a missionary for the international organisation PIME in the south from 1998 before retiring in 2000 to set up his restaurant, his colleagues said.
The gunmen are holding nearly 20 other foreign hostages, all but one of them abducted since 2014.
The Abu Sayyaf last month posted a video of two Canadians, a Norwegian and a Filipina they kidnapped in September last year and set an April 8 deadline for ransom to be paid or the foreigners would be killed.
The deadline passed on Friday with no word on their fates. The group beheaded a Malaysian tourist last year.
The latest groups of victims were 10 Indonesian and four Malaysian crew members snatched over the past two weeks from a tugboat and a cargo ship near the southern Philippines.

Iron Wings, a newly-unveiled air combat game, will see players taking to the skies above some of modern history's most well-known theatres of war.
Recently pitched on Kickstarter, the game follows two friends, Jack and Amelia, as they join the U.S. Air Force and undertake a mission to stop a secret Nazi group called the Ahnenerbe (based on a real pseudoscientific research organisation headed by Heinrich Himmler). Unlike many other military games, where the story seems an afterthought, the development team promises that the story and characters are just important to their vision as ensuring that the gameplay mechanics are engaging and intense.
As for the gameplay, although Iron Wings is billed as an air combat game, it will also feature on-foot sections, and both of these styles will be on display throughout the campaign, beginning with training in New York, and extending across the battlefields of Europe, including Sicily, Poland, and Germany. Despite the purported historical accuracy of the scenario and settings, the game will hew closer to arcade-style mechanics, rather than burdening players with the complexity of flight sims.
Simple in this case, however, does not mean vacuous. Players will be able to switch between the two characters, each in their own plane, on-the-fly while issuing orders to the other. To differentiate the two, each plane will be carrying different equipment, forcing players to be aware of their situation at all times. Take a look at the video embedded below to see the game in action and find out a bit more about its development.
Iron Wings seems a promising experience that harks back to an earlier age. Although dogfighting has long been a staple of Battlefield's multiplayer, and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare introduced extraterrestial dogfighting into the series earlier this month, some years have passed since we last saw a campaign dedicated to the activity, especially in a World War 2 setting.
The game is being crafted by Naps Team, a veteran Italian developer with more than twenty years of experience creating titles for almost every console from the Amiga forward. While only freshly uploaded to Kickstarter, Iron Wings is already in an advanced stage of development with an estimated release date of Q4 2017 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.
You can find out more about Iron Wings on its Steam Greenlight page, and back it on Kickstarter, if it scratches an itch.

Last night, there was this tweet:
The fellow works for Buzzfeed, and highly liberal and pro-climate outfit. It was quite an admission. Since existing climate plans are almost certain to be on the scrap heap now, here's a new plan from Christopher Monckton. I agree with most of it, except item 7 “Abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency”. That's not really practical. Before “climate change” became the universal boogeyman for any enviro-ailment, real or imagined, the EPA actually did useful work in dealing with real, tangible, pollution issues. We have cleaner air, cleaner lakes, and cleaner waterways today because of that. So rather than abolish it, which would allow resurgence of those problems by the unscrupulous, I think a significant curtailment, plus a revocation of their powers of enforcement – putting enforcement in the hands of law, is a better choice.. – Anthony
Guest opinion by Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
1. U.S. withdrawal from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, from the Paris climate agreement and from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: The President of the United States should invite the Secretary of State to serve upon the Secretary General of the United Nations, qua Depositary, immediate notification of withdrawal from the Framework Convention on Climate Change and from all protocols or agreements thereunder, including the Paris climate agreement, in terms of Article 25 [withdrawal] of the Convention, which provides for a year's delay before the withdrawal takes effect. Under Article 28 [withdrawal] of the Paris climate agreement, notification of withdrawal from the Framework Convention entails automatic withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and from any obligations thereunder. Pour politesse, the Government of France, qua Depository of that agreement, should also be given immediate notification of withdrawal. Separate immediate notification of withdrawal should be given to the Secretary General of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
2. Termination, on environmental and humanitarian grounds, of all Federal Government payments to foreign entities in connection with climate change: The President should invite the Secretaries of State and to the Treasury to terminate all payments to foreign entities in connection with climate change at the earliest permissible dates, and to report the savings achieved to the White House Chief of Staff at monthly intervals until all such payments have ceased.
3. Termination, on environmental grounds, of all Federal Government subsidies for climate change research and for “renewable” energy. The President should invite the Secretary to the Treasury to terminate all climate subsidies at the earliest permissible dates, and to report the savings to the White House Chief of Staff at monthly intervals until all such subsidies have ceased.
4. Nullification of all previous Executive Orders mandating any action on climate change. The President should invite the Chief of Staff to put before him a draft executive Order nullifying forthwith all Executive Orders concerning climate change and related matters.
5. Program of U.S. humanitarian assistance with the installation of coal-fired power stations and electricity grid infrastructures in regions without electric power. The President and the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury and of Energy should jointly announce a program of U.S. humanitarian assistance with the intention of preventing the millions of deaths each year among the 1.2 billion people who do not have the life-saving benefits of electric power. Coal-fired power is preferable because it is cheaper per TWh generated than any other form of power, and because stocks of coal are plentiful, and because the clean technology of the current generation of power stations is easier for third-world nations to maintain than any other form of power.
6. Independent inquiry into climate change science. The President should invite the Secretary of Energy to establish an independent inquiry into climate change science, to address the questions 1. At what rate will our enrichment of the atmosphere with CO 2 and other greenhouse gases warm the world? and 2. Is mitigation of global warming today cost-effective compared with adaptation to its consequences the day after tomorrow? Scientists and economists sympathetic to the President's opinion should be appointed to the inquiry, whose effect will be to provide ample justification for the President's earlier decisions to resile from international climate agreements and to terminate climate-related payments and subsidies.
7. Abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency: The President should exercise his influence over Congress to enact at the earliest opportunity a Bill to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's activities run counter to the interstate commerce provisions of the U.S. Constitution, and its functions would be better performed if transferred to the States.
8. Approval for the Keystone XL pipeline: The President, after consulting the cabinet, should at the earliest opportunity announce approval for the Keystone XL pipeline.
9. Reversal of scientifically-unjustifiable measures such as the listing of polar bears as endangered should be carried out at the earliest opportunity.
10. Investigation of scientific and economic frauds in connection with climate change science and economics, and with renewable energy, should be set in hand at once.

Senator Bernie Sanders fought back tears during an emotional moment during Day 2 of the Democratic National Convention. His brother Larry Sanders cast his vote for his younger brother in a heartfelt speech during the roll-call vote.
“I want to bring before this convention the names of our parents Eli Sanders and Dorothy Glassberg Sanders. They did not have easy lives and they died young. They would be immensely proud of their son and his accomplishment,” an emotional Larry addressed the attendees.
“They loved the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt and would be especially proud that Bernard is renewing that vision. It is with enormous pride that I cast my vote for Bernie Sanders,” he added, earning cheers of support. Watch Bernie's reaction below.

Hillary Clinton was officially elected at the Democratic candidate after Sanders stopped the roll-call vote and stood by Clinton. His rival at this point already had the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
“I move that all votes, all votes cast by delegates be reflected in the official record and I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States,” Sanders announced.
In 2008, Clinton did a similar move when she lost out to Barack Obama, calling in from New York and thus the roll-call ended there. As for Sanders and Clinton, the final tally excluded Vermont's votes in favor of the acclimation and came down 2,838 votes for Clinton and 1,843 for Sanders with 55 abstentions.

If capitalism is a system that concentrates power in the hands of a small minority, the alternative of socialism is exactly the opposite, writes Elizabeth Schulte .
CAPITALISM IS, among other things, a system of "experts."
In the halls of government, politicians and policymakers decide for us when to go to war and when to fund social services. In courtrooms, judges decide what constitutes a crime and a criminal, based on testimony and argument from police and lawyers.
In workplaces, efficiency experts decide the best way to organize the desks or the machines or the hospital beds--and the owners and capitalists decide what should be produced and how much of it, based on what their financial experts tell them.
The majority of people--the non-"experts" who work in the workplaces and are prosecuted by the laws--also make important decisions every day.
A worker with asthma decides whether to risk getting fired in order to stay home to take care of their health. Another decides whether it's worth drawing attention to himself by filing a safety complaint or just working around the problem. An undocumented immigrant decides to look the other way while her boss steals her wages, for fear of being detained and deported.
Above: Chilean workers demonstrate during the early 1970s rebellion; below: at a union meeting in the U.S.
On any given day, millions of workers make important and sometimes life-changing decisions. But they make them under conditions they have no control over.
They make them under conditions created by the "experts" in society. And while workers base their decisions on how to best to survive under these conditions, the experts have a higher purpose--profit.
THE DECISIONS these so-called experts make are in the interest of capitalism and ensuring an unequal situation--in which the majority work so that a minority can reap the profits, which by its definition means that the people who do the work never see the full fruits of their labor.
If they live in the U.S., workers can vote for candidates and sometimes on ballot initiatives every few years. They can call their representatives and lobby on an issue. But their input is far removed from the actual decision-making process in Washington or their state and city governments.
And workers are even farther away from the decision-making where they work, even though that's where they spend the bulk of their waking hours.
This, however, doesn't mean that workers couldn't make all the decisions that are out of their hands under capitalism--that are made by experts or an elite.
If you don't believe that, ask a nurse. Understaffing and long hours are hallmarks of health care in the U.S., creating dangerous situations for patients and nurses who care for them.
Talk to most nurses, and they will tell you what resources they need to make sure that patients get the care they need. They can also tell you where to cut the waste that for-profit health care generates, and how some of the work rules and all of the supervisors get in the way of care.
While we're on the subject, ask someone at a health insurance company what their job would look like if the health care system prioritized care for everyone. If they were honest, they would tell you that the company they work for should be eliminated.
Under capitalism, rules are imposed primarily to increase productivity and profit, at the expense of workers' well-being. Discipline is imposed on workers in various ways--through supervisors enforcing company procedures, through co-workers being pitted against one another, or through the threat of unemployment since there is always a reserve of workers without jobs to take our place.
Alongside these forms of coercion in the workplace, state institutions impose further discipline on workers. That's where the cops and prisons come in.
WHEN REVOLUTIONARY socialists talk about "socialism from below" and a workers' government, we mean workers making decisions about the way that all society is organized--from what happens at their workplaces to how the resources of society should be used.
The iron wall between what are considered "political" and "economic" questions would have to fall away.
Today, "politics" appears to float above the things that happen every day at work. But when you scratch beneath the surface, this isn't the situation at all. With every decision they make, our elected officials fundamentally work in the interests of capitalism, even while they are vulnerable to public pressure and protest.
And while state institutions under capitalism like the police and the courts are perfect for disciplining workers and maintaining inequality and profit, they are completely useless for a system that prioritizes providing for human need above all else.
During the process of struggle, when workers come into conflict with the status quo, they arrive at new conclusions--about themselves and the people they work with, as well as their rulers. During sustained revolutionary struggle, ideas can change dramatically, including about whether workers themselves are more capable of running society.
Karl Marx pioneered a version of socialism that could only be achieved by the working class itself. His phrase "the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves" became a watchword of the socialist movement.
Marx identified the source of workers' power in their position of creating all wealth in society and their resulting power to shut it down--which they are able to do only through their collective strength.
So if workers' power is in their collective strength as a class, a workers' government would be based on where their power lies--the workplace.
CURRENTLY, WORKERS wield no power and make no decisions at work, and the only votes they have are far removed from their everyday lives. But during times of struggle historically, workers have formed their own democratic structures to build the greatest unity and make day-to-day decisions--as in the case of workers' committees during a strike.
In times of revolutionary upheaval, these basic forms of workers' democracy combine to become councils, with elected leadership. These examples show how a worker-run democracy is not only possible, but can challenge the existing state. They give us an important glimpse into what a society would look like with workers in the driver's seat.
There are many examples through history of workers' councils that deserve to be read about individually: The Paris Commune of 1871, the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, the Italian factory movement of 1919-20, Germany's revolutionary years from 1918 to 1923, the Spanish Revolution of 1936, Hungary in 1956, Portugal in 1974-75, Iran in 1979, Poland in 1980-81 and on and on.
Forms of workers' democracy arise during conditions of extreme crisis, when it seemed like the old order wouldn't be able to function in the same way as before.
For example, in Chile, the workers' councils, or cordones, emerged in opposition to a "bosses' strike" against the democratically elected government of socialist Salvador Allende--but they were largely a product of the class struggle that opposed the corrupt Frei regime before it.
When truck owners and factory bosses attempted to close down production in October 1972, the cordones responded immediately, while Allende was conciliatory, calling for order to be restored. As socialist author Mike Gonzalez wrote:
Trucks were forcibly taken and put back on the road, factories were occupied and kept at work, distribution was organized directly and shops reopened by local distribution committees--the Communal Commands--while medical personnel on the left kept the hospitals open. The so-called leadership of the workers' movement was left behind by this qualitative leap in the level and nature of workers' self-organization. When the bosses' strike was defeated, it was clear that it was the Chilean working class that had inflicted that defeat.
Workers' confidence grew after these confrontations, and also exposed the weakness of the Allende government to defend itself, much less meet workers' demands.
DURING REVOLUTIONARY situations, the old structures and mechanisms prove to be inadequate for the kind of democracy that workers need to run society themselves.
In the process, workers come to see that another form of organization has to be created.
The Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky wrote about his experience with the workers' councils, known by the Russian word "soviets," during the 1905 revolution in Russia:
The Soviet came into being as a response to an objective need--a need born of the course of events. It was an organization which was authoritative and yet had no traditions; which could immediately involve a scattered mass of hundreds of thousands of people while having virtually no organizational machinery; which united the revolutionary currents within the proletariat; which was capable of initiative and spontaneous self control--and most important of all, which could be brought out from underground within 24 hours.
The Petersburg soviet, which formed out of a strike wave over economic demands, but also calls for greater political freedoms, was made up of delegates from striking factories. While it lasted only 50 days in 1905, it would be an important testing ground for the new workers' organizations that sprung up 12 years later.
As Trotsky wrote in his book 1905:
The soviet organized the working masses, directed the political strikes and demonstrations, armed the workers and protected the population against pogroms. Similar work was also done by other revolutionary organizations before the soviet came into existence, concurrently with it, and after it. Yet this did not endow them with the influence that was concentrated in the hands of the soviet. The secret of this influence lay in the fact that the soviet grew as the natural organ of the proletariat in its immediate struggle for power as determined by the actual course of events. The name of 'workers' government,' which the workers themselves on the one hand, and the reactionary press on the other, gave to the soviet was an expression of the fact that the soviet really was a workers' government in embryo.
During the Russian Revolution of 1917, workers' councils once again formed the backbone of workers' organization. In June 1917, there were hundreds of soviets across Russia. After months of struggle, the workers' councils were eventually able to prevail over the old state structures that initially existed alongside it.
THE WORKING class faces a powerful and well-organized enemy--the ruling class with all its state institutions and ideology on its side. Workers will need their own centralized and democratic structures in order to make decisions and carry them out against such a powerful opponent.
During that process, workers--the real experts--develop their own organizing that help form the basis for future society, where the priority is fulfilling human need and everything else. This means not just the bare minimum, but the freedoms denied us in this society, like the time to debate and make decisions.
The American socialist John Reed described it this way in his Ten Days That Shook the World about the Russian Revolution:

In Japan, waiting times are so short that most patients don't bother to make an appointment. One Thursday morning in Tokyo, I called the prestigious orthopedic clinic at Keio University Hospital to schedule a consultation about my aching shoulder. "Why don't you just drop by?" the receptionist said. That same afternoon, I was in the surgeon's office. Dr. Nakamichi recommended an operation. "When could we do it?" I asked. The doctor checked his computer and said, "Tomorrow would be pretty difficult. Perhaps some day next week?"
3. Foreign health-care systems are inefficient, bloated bureaucracies.
Much less so than here. It may seem to Americans that U.S.-style free enterprise -- private-sector, for-profit health insurance -- is naturally the most cost-effective way to pay for health care. But in fact, all the other payment systems are more efficient than ours.
U.S. health insurance companies have the highest administrative costs in the world; they spend roughly 20 cents of every dollar for nonmedical costs, such as paperwork, reviewing claims and marketing. France's health insurance industry, in contrast, covers everybody and spends about 4 percent on administration. Canada's universal insurance system, run by government bureaucrats, spends 6 percent on administration. In Taiwan, a leaner version of the Canadian model has administrative costs of 1.5 percent; one year, this figure ballooned to 2 percent, and the opposition parties savaged the government for wasting money.
The world champion at controlling medical costs is Japan, even though its aging population is a profligate consumer of medical care. On average, the Japanese go to the doctor 15 times a year, three times the U.S. rate. They have twice as many MRI scans and X-rays. Quality is high; life expectancy and recovery rates for major diseases are better than in the United States. And yet Japan spends about $3,400 per person annually on health care; the United States spends more than $7,000.
4. Cost controls stifle innovation.
False. The United States is home to groundbreaking medical research, but so are other countries with much lower cost structures. Any American who's had a hip or knee replacement is standing on French innovation. Deep-brain stimulation to treat depression is a Canadian breakthrough. Many of the wonder drugs promoted endlessly on American television, including Viagra, come from British, Swiss or Japanese labs.
Overseas, strict cost controls actually drive innovation. In the United States, an MRI scan of the neck region costs about $1,500. In Japan, the identical scan costs $98. Under the pressure of cost controls, Japanese researchers found ways to perform the same diagnostic technique for one-fifteenth the American price. (And Japanese labs still make a profit.)
5. Health insurance has to be cruel.
Borussia Dortmund have agreed to prematurely extend the contract of forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has been coveted by a number of European clubs, until 30 June 2020. The speedy striker's initial contract was set to expire in 2018.
"I'm absolutely delighted that the next years of my career will be spent at Borussia Dortmund. I feel very happy at the club, in this team and in this city. BVB has become like a second home to me. Every part of me wants to be here and I have never wanted to leave," said the 26-year-old striker, who joined the club in 2013.
"Auba has developed outstandingly. We are very happy that we have been able to tie him down to a long-term contract," explained Sporting Director Michael Zorc after Aubameyang's contract had been extended.
The Gabon international, who was born in the French town of Laval and has a French passport, was a consistent performer in his first two seasons in Dortmund, scoring twelve and 16 Bundesliga goals respectively. In the 2014/15 season, he found the net 25 times across all competitions.
Over the past several years AnandTech has grown to be much more than just a PC hardware review site. In fact, we consider ourselves to be just as much about the new mobile world as we do about the old PC world. We leveraged our understanding of component and system architecture in bringing a deeper, more analytical look to mobile silicon and devices. As we continued to invest in our mobile coverage and expertise, we found that readers, mobile component and device makers responded quite well to our approach.
AnandTech's focus grew, but we quickly ran into a bottleneck when it came time to monetize that mobile content. Our mobile content did a great job of helping to grow the site (as well as bring new eyeballs to our traditional PC coverage as well). While we had no issues competing with larger corporate owned sites on the content front, when it came to advertising we were at a disadvantage. Our advantage in quality allowed us to make progress, but ultimately it became a numbers game. The larger corporate owned sites could show up with a network of traffic, substantially larger than what AnandTech could deliver, and land more lucrative advertising deals than we were able to. They could then in turn fund a larger editorial operation and the cycle continues.
AnandTech has been profitable since its inception; it's been on a great growth curve these past couple of years and we've always been able to do more with less, but lately there's been an increased investment in high quality content. It wasn't that long ago where the only type of content seeing real investment was shallow, poorly researched and ultimately very cable-TV-news-like. More recently however we've seen a shift. Higher quality content is being valued and some big names (both on the publishing and VC fronts) have been investing in them. Honestly we haven't seen a world like this in probably over a decade.
Before his departure, Anand spent almost a year meeting with all of the big names in the publishing space, both traditional and new media players. The goal was to find AnandTech a home with a partner that had a sustainable business model (similar to AnandTech's), but could add the investment and existing reach to allow the site to better realize its potential. That search led to a number of interesting potential partners; it was a refreshing experience to say the least knowing that there are groups in the world who really value good content. Ultimately that search brought AnandTech to Purch.
Purch met the requirements: they have a sustainable business model, are profitable and have the sort of reach AnandTech needs to really hit the next level. More fundamentally however, Purch's values are in line with AnandTech's. In fact, it wasn't that long ago that Purch acquired one of AnandTech's biggest competitors in the late 1990s: Tom's Hardware. Purch had already demonstrated a value for the sort of deep, long form content AnandTech was known for. In meeting with the Purch business and editorial teams, there was a clear interest in further developing AnandTech's strengths as well as feeding back AnandTech's learnings into the rest of the Purch family.
AnandTech and Tom's Hardware remain editorially independent, and though no longer competitors, the goal is to learn from one another. To further invest in the areas that make us different, and together with the rest of the Purch family help to bring a higher standard of quality to the web.
The AnandTech team is staying in place and will continue to focus on existing coverage areas. We're not changing our editorial policies or analytical approach and have no intentions of doing so. The one thing that will change is our ability to continue to grow the site. This if anything starts from the top; with a publisher to more directly handle the business of AnandTech, this frees me up to spend more time on content creation and helping the rest of our editors put together better articles. And in a hands-on business like journalism that benefit cannot be overstated.
AnandTech was an incredibly powerful force as an independent publisher, but it now joins a family whose combined traffic is eight times larger than what AnandTech was on its own. Our goal is to continue to invest in what we feel is the right approach to building high quality content; now we have an even greater ability to do just that.
Image caption Local authorities in Yorkshire are spending £4m for repairs to roads ahead of the Tour de France in July
Yorkshire's local authorities have told the BBC it would cost more than £1bn to fix the region's road network and the backlog of repairs would take 11 years to complete.
The region's rutted roads will be under intense scrutiny this year as the Tour de France, the world's biggest cycling race, begins in Leeds on 5 July.
The problem is most acute in North Yorkshire, where the council has recently begged the government for an additional £5m "towards the cost of averting a crisis on the roads".
North Yorkshire County Council is responsible for more than half of the roads used in the Tour's two Yorkshire stages, and it is committed to spending at least £2m on bringing them up to scratch.
A total of eight Yorkshire councils have allocated £4m for repairs to the 241 miles (389km) of roads that the stars of the race will be using this summer.
This is the largest single expense associated with staging the event.
How much each local authority believes it will cost to repair roads North Yorkshire - £322m
Kirklees £138m
Doncaster £122m
Calderdale £100m
Leeds £92m
York £80m
Rotherham £70m
Wakefield £68m
Bradford £50m
No response from Barnsley or Sheffield Source: BBC Yorkshire
But with no additional money for event-related repairs coming from central government, Yorkshire's councils have had to simply rejig their existing highway maintenance programmes to prioritise roads along the route.
'Insufficient funding'
That means key routes around Harrogate, Leeds, Sheffield and York, as well as smaller roads in the Yorkshire Dales and elsewhere, will be resurfaced, but there is the knock-on effect of pushing other roads further down the schedule.
The work is well under way - and some councils have chosen to fix poor roads near the route at the same time - but with new potholes appearing as fast as they are patched, many authorities are struggling to keep up.
"Insufficient funding for maintenance is not a problem unique to North Yorkshire, but I believe we feel the pain particularly badly," wrote council leader John Weighell in a letter to the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.
"We are vulnerable to extreme weather, and our dispersed population and rural economy make our minor roads particularly important.
Image caption Local authorities in Yorkshire claim it would take 11 years to complete repairs to the region's road network
"Added to this, the cars, HGVs and agricultural vehicles are getting heavier, and this has increased their impact on these minor roads."
Mr Weighell added that it would cost £332m to clear the council's road maintenance mountain, and even if it was cleared, he would still need £60m a year to keep the roads in good condition.
North Yorkshire, which has the country's third largest road network, currently receives £28m a year from the government for road repairs.
But as Mr Weighell admitted, bad roads are not limited to his patch, and neither are complaints about long-standing underinvestment and more recent cuts.
Peter Box, the leader of Wakefield Council and chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, told the BBC: "Unless something changes, we risk seeing large swathes of Britain's road network dangerously strewn with potholes and becoming so unsafe they will need to be shut completely."
The state of Yorkshire & The Humber's roads Estimated time to clear highway maintenance backlog - 11 years
Average one-off "catch-up" cost per authority - £107m
Average number of potholes filled over last year per authority - 14,505
Average frequency of road surfacing - 50 years
Average additional costs of 2012 flood damage per affected authority - £3.9m Source: Asphalt Industry Alliance's 2013 Alarm survey
'Improvements needed'
This stark warning is supported by the Asphalt Industry Alliance's Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (Alarm) survey, which found in 2013 that one in five roads in England and Wales needs fixing, at a total cost of £10.5bn.
BBC Yorkshire asked the 11 local authorities responsible for the region's roads what they thought it would cost to repair them all, and nine responded.
The total, without Barnsley and Sheffield, came to £1.042bn.
To put that figure into context, it is more than most local authorities spend each year.
It is little wonder, then, that the sorry state of the nation's roads ranks so highly on taxpayers' lists of gripes.
Compensation claims from motorists who damaged their vehicles in potholes topped £32m in England and Wales last year.
The annual National Highways and Transport public satisfaction survey revealed that people rate the condition of the highway to be the most important transport service their local authority provides.
But the state of the roads is also the issue that provides the greatest "performance gap" between importance and satisfaction.
In Sheffield, for example, only 14% of people were satisfied with the city's road surfaces, with 81% dissatisfied. This may explain why the council has recently handed over all of its road maintenance work to private contractor Amey in a £1.2bn private finance initiative.
There is some good news, though, for Yorkshire's hard-pressed road crews: where they have fixed the highway, their work is appreciated.
Triathlon superstars Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee do most of their cycle training on the roads north of Leeds, and they have noticed a Tour dividend.
Image caption Triathlon champions, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee. have praised road improvements along the route
Olympic and double world triathlon champion Alistair said: "Lots of the roads up here are pretty bad, but it's been fantastic to ride on the roads where the Tour is going.
"Over the last six months, we've seen them putting new tarmac down, and we've enjoyed riding on it."
His younger brother Jonathan agreed.
"You can definitely notice the changes. The roads do need to improve, but it is happening," he said.
And with this year's Tour paying tribute to the 100th anniversary of the start of World War One by visiting the cobbled roads near the Belgian town of Ypres, Yorkshire's roads will definitely not be the bumpiest that the likes of Mark Cavendish and Chris Froome travel down.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gestures to supporters at her New Hampshire presidential primary campaign rally on Feb. 9 in Hooksett, N.H. (Elise Amendola/AP)
With New Hampshire in the rearview mirror, Hillary Clinton is looking ahead to South Carolina, Nevada and other states where support from African American voters will be crucial if she wants to clinch the Democratic nomination.
Then came this: Influential Atlantic writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has publicly criticized Bernie Sanders for his opposition to monetary reparations, will be voting for the Vermont senator, he told Democracy Now's Amy Goodman on Wednesday.
"I'm stunned, but I'm pleasantly stunned," Coates said of Sanders's New Hampshire victory.
Coates may have pushed back against calling it an endorsement, and he still remains critical of Sanders regarding reparations (. But where Coates landed this primary season underscores a potential vulnerability for Clinton: her weakness among young voters could chip away at the support she has among black and Latino voters — and be a boon for Sanders, whose base of support skews young.
So yeah. This ain't "feeling the Bern." It's just trying to be a decent citizen and as transparent as I can be. — Ta-Nehisi Coates (@tanehisicoates) February 10, 2016
[After New Hampshire, Sanders and Clinton woo black voters]
When asked about monetary reparations for slavery, Sanders and Clinton have both said they favor investments for minority and marginalized communities. Coates on Wednesday said that despite those similar positions, "I expected more" of Sanders.
Coates also told Goodman: "Like a lot of people, I'm very, very concerned about Senator Clinton's record. I'm very, very concerned about where her positions were in the 1990s, when we had some of the most disgusting legislation in terms of our criminal justice, really, in this country's history."
Coates isn't alone. Former NAACP president Benjamin Jealous has forcefully endorsed Sanders. "I looked at his record," Jealous, the youngest person to head the civil rights organization, said Tuesday. "On the issues that Dr. Martin Luther King referred to as the 'giant triplets of evil' — racism, militarism and greed — Bernie is the clearest and the most consistent."
[Clinton tries to put her campaign back on track with a new strategy]
That critique was echoed by "New Jim Crow" author Michelle Alexander, whose book helped invigorate the public dialogue about racism and mass incarceration. "Black voters have been remarkably loyal to the Clintons for more than 25 years," Alexander wrote Wednesday, adding that Bill Clinton "presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history.”
Noting that Hillary and Bill Clinton have since said they regret the crime bill and the policies of tough-on-crime era, Alexander continues: "But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key."

Sanders also has campaign surrogates such as rapper Killer Mike, who has publicly argued with Coates about the Vermont senator's position on reparations.
But whether such public proclamations are outliers or signals of something deeper remains to be seen. Clinton's support among African American voters around the country is deep. In South Carolina, nearly three-fourths of likely black primary voters are backing her, according to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll conducted in January. (Samples sizes for the survey, conducted before New Hampshire and Martin O'Malley's exit from the race, include 100 people or more.)
That same poll found 81 percent of African Americans in the state who are 45 and older support her, compared to 11 percent who supported Sanders. A majority of likely black South Carolina voters under 45 also said they're voting Clinton.
[Bernie Sanders's real problem with black and Hispanic voters]
And Clinton has her surrogates as well, including black leaders who are now vocally criticizing Sanders on issues of race.
"Bernie Sanders as mayor, as a member of the House, as a member of the United States Senate, has been missing in action on issues that are important to the African Americans," said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, The Post reported. "There's no credibility to the things that are being said at the twilight of his political career."
Looking ahead to Nevada and elsewhere, Clinton and Sanders have both signaled the importance of shoring up support among non-white voters. Clinton left New Hampshire before Tuesday's primary to visit Flint, Mich., a predominately black city with a water supply poisoned by lead. And the day after her New Hampshire loss, news emerged that Clinton's allies formed a $25 million effort to mobilize African American and Latino voters
Sanders had a very public breakfast with Al Sharpton at Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem on Wednesday (Sharpton said he's waiting until after he meets with Clinton to make an endorsement).
“But our issues cannot be marginalized,” Sharpton said later, The Post reported. “In January of next year, for the first time in American history, an African American family will be moving out of the White House. I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them.”

So, why is impeachment "off the table?" Of course, it is not within my powers to read minds and hold a crystal ball. Not being some kind of Merlyn or Wizard of Oz, all I can do is speculate. But based on a few facts, I think there is ample evidence to conclude that Congress fears not turning off their constituents with the "waste of time" argument by doing a negative show where impeachment is concerned. Neither are they, I believe, lying down or "caving" in to Bush's fear mongering.
Instead, I believe they are protecting themselves. If they impeached either Bush or Cheney, so much would come to light about Congress' own complicity in Bush and Cheney's crime rings, that they would be impeaching themselves along with the two murderers holding nuclear weapons in their hands.
Having posted this a million times before, let me apologize right now for the eyeball-rolling repetition. Those of you who have read what I have posted about the Congressional voting record, may sign off here right now, keeping in mind what I have stated above. But before you do sign off, let me suggest that it would be terribly important to have a communal brainstorm: How do we get around the problem of impeachment being "off the table" based on Congress' attempts to protect their seats in office, and not to earn themselves a seat in jail? I doubt that they are protecting Bush and Cheney, who are disgraces to the Republican and Democratic parties alike. Far from it. Instead, they are self-concerned. And until we can find a way to break through, impeachment is never going to happen. Period.
What do you, dear readers, think is the solution?

You can verify all the facts below on the ACLU"s website, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, by punching in the names of each bill into their search boxes: www.aclu.org www.ccrjustice.com www.eff.org
It was the former Republican majority which passed the Military Commissions Act (MCA, or torture bill) by nearly unanimous vote. This bill allows for the euphemistic term "torture" of detainees and their confessions squealed up under pain levels "equivalent to severe organ failure or death", such as invoked by a "hand slap" done with steel cables three inches thick. This false evidence, squealed up by mostly completely innocent detainees, is permissible as "evidence" in the MCA. Habeas corpus is nixed, meaning that the detainees have no right to challenge the grounds for their detention (thus assuring the secrecy of the crime ring, in which mostly innocent people are captured and tortured as so-called "terrorists").
- Advertisement -
And worse still, it grants the Prez, and future Prez's, immunity from prosecution as a war criminal for invoking this kind of cruel and unusual punishment for the crime of not being a terrorist at all, in most cases. To boot, a mere photo in the newspapers would seem to be enough "evidence" to convince a world full of people that a "terrorist ringleader" has been caught. All this in absence of court trials...and we automatically believe everything we hear and read! Please pass word on: It ain't right, to say the least, to consider a mere newspaper photograph as ample "proof" that the Government has caught a "terrorist".
In fact, the ACLU states in its movie Stop the Abuse of Power, that out of 850 Guantanamo detainees, only twelve of them (in the best of my memory) are guilty. The Red Cross estimates that more than 75% of "terrorist" detainees are innocent, and Amnesty International is vociferous. Check out the Center for Constitutional Rights's website about this, too.
So....why the "revelation" and "Surprise" and "horror" to "find out" that Bush presided over individual torture cases all along, and that he "approved" ?
Repeat: CONGRESS voted for this. IE it wasn't just Bush who is The Problem Acting Alone. It was the Republicans, by nearly solid unanimity who voted for the MCA. Democrats just as solidly voted against it.
Is the "Surprise" and the ensuing "investigations" of Bush's torturing a big pretense? Methinks the answer is "yes", as may be obvious by now.

If Dems voted against the MCA, are they innocent and not guilty? Far from it. The unconstitutional Patriot Act works hand-and-glove with the MCA. It may be subtle, but on close analysis one comes to realize that the Patriot Act is actually quite instrumental in capturing innocent "Terrorists":
a) Defines "terrorists" to include activists. The Center for Constitutional Rights is vociferous about this, stating that the definition of terrorists in the PA "Could be misconstrued" to crack down on "First amendment rights", ie, free speech. Thus, vocal individuals would be vulnerable to targeting as "Terrorists". Witness: 911 truth activists called "Terrorists" by the Administration. After all, the rationale is this: If you expose the truth about 911, you are siding with terrorists, ie committing treason. That's a twisted rationale which, in fact, is more likely a stunningly accurate projection of the Government's own dynamic. What we reject in ourselves, we see in the world around us. Such would seem to be the case, where our Government is concerned.
b) Grants expanded wiretapping powers without warrant. Thus, the PA side-steps the power of the judiciary as a fundamental arm of government, with the function of putting a "check" on government power. The implications of this unchecked power is scary.

CLEVELAND – Speaking at his pre-game press conference on Tuesday, U.S. Men's National Team head coach Jurgen Klinsmann made it clear that the pair of upcoming friendlies will serve as an opportunity for players to prove themselves and he even used the player sitting next to him as a prime example.
That player was Sacha Kljestan.
Klinsmann revealed during the press conference that he is set to give Kjestan his first U.S. start in two years and the first under his watch when the Americans battle Belgium on Wednesday night at FirstEnergy Stadium. Even more interesting is the fact that Kljestan will get that start in central midfield, where is often deployed for Pro League champions Anderlecht but rarely used under Klinsmann.
The absences of Michael Bradley, Danny Williams and other midfield options may have opened the door for Kljestan to earn his first start since Bob Bradley coached the U.S. to a 2-1 win over Honduras in the 2011 Gold Cup semifinals. But Kljestan's form at the club level in recent months has convinced Klinsmann that the veteran midfielder is ready for a look in his more natural position.
“There's a reason why Sacha is here,” said Klinsmann. “He won, again, the Belgian title and had to swallow a couple of pills over the last two years here because he's not getting that many games as he hopes to get. But he deserves to be part of this strong group and now has the opportunity tomorrow to start in midfield alongside Jermaine Jones and playing against his second home country.
“It's just a big compliment to him, how he performed all year round with Anderlecht and how every time he comes in here in camp, he shows his qualities to the entire group.”
Kljestan is no stranger to playing centrally. Aside from being deployed in the middle of the park for Anderlecht, Kljestan played primarily as a central midfielder when he broke onto the international scene in 2009.
In recent years, however, Klinsmann has opted to use the 27-year-old as a bench option for the wings. That might not be Kljestan's preferred position but he does not mind playing there, especially since that versatility and flexibility have seen him go from often overlooked to a regular on U.S. rosters.
While Kljestan could further cement his place on the team with a solid showing on Wednesday against the nation he is quite familiar with, he is also looking at the friendly vs. Belgium as a test run for what could come in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. Bradley and Jones, two of Klinsmann's preferred starting midfielders, are one caution away from being suspended due to yellow-card accumulation and should that happen, Kljestan might be asked play in his preferred spot once again.
“It's an honor to be with the national team (and) I'll play whatever position is asked of me and I'll do anything to help the team but I'm also excited to play at center midfield with Jermaine,” said Kljestan. “I know also that some guys have yellow cards coming in – I'm fortunate that Michael is not here so that now I get a chance to play – but if it so happens that Michael or Jermaine pick up a suspension at some point through qualifying, I want to prove to the coaches that I'm able to step in and do the job in the middle of the field and help the team as well, so I'm excited about that opportunity.”
An Israeli minister called for the assassination of Syrian President Bashar Assad on Tuesday, saying he “does not have a place in this world.”
Speaking at a conference outside Jerusalem, Housing and Construction Minister Yoav Galant, a retired IDF general, said that in light of recent allegations that Assad's regime carried out mass executions and burned the bodies of the victims, he had to be killed.
“The reality of the situation in Syria is that they are executing people, using directed chemical attacks against them, and the latest extreme — burning their corpses, something we haven't seen in 70 years,” Galant said, in a reference to the Holocaust.

The minister said Assad's actions in Syria amount to nothing less than a “genocide,” with “hundreds of thousands killed.”
On Monday, the United States State Department accused the Assad regime of carrying out mass killings of thousands of prisoners and burning the bodies in a large crematorium outside the capital.
“In my view, we are crossing a red line. And in my view, the time has come to assassinate Assad. It's as simple as that,” said Galant, who previously served as the head of the IDF's Southern Command.
Galant likened the assassination of Assad to cutting off the “tail of the snake.” After that, he said, “we can focus on the head, which is in Tehran.”
In a conversation with The Times of Israel after his speech, Galant stood by his comments.
He acknowledged that targeted political assassinations are considered illegal under international law, but clarified that he “wasn't speaking about practicalities.”
However, he added, “Anyone who murders people and burns their corpses does not have a place in this world.”
The State Department said it believed about 50 detainees a day are being hanged at Saydnaya military prison, about 45 minutes north of Damascus. Many of the bodies, it said, are then burned in the crematorium.
“We believe that the building of a crematorium is an effort to cover up the extent of mass murders taking place,” said Stuart Jones, the top US diplomat for the Middle East, in accusing the Syrian government of sinking “to a new level of depravity.”
During his speech, Galant also said that in a wider view, Assad and his ally Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group, are larger threats to the world order than the Islamic State and other Sunni terrorist groups.
Galant was speaking at the Israel Defense publication's “Ground Warfare and Logistics” conference at the tank museum in Latrun.
“The world will wipe out Daesh, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda,” he said, using the Arabic nickname for the Islamic State.
Galant said his assessment came from the fact that those terrorist groups do not enjoy the same level of support as Syria and Hezbollah, which are backed by Iran.

This past weekend, Haleakalā Ranch welcomed 200 Friends of Haleakalā volunteers for their annual Christmas Tree cutting event.
Volunteers removed close to 500 invasive pine trees from the Puʻu Nianiau area near the entrance to Haleakalā National Park.
The fresh pines have since become Christmas trees for Maui families while the greenery was collected for the Montessori School of Maui holiday fundraiser.
SPONSORED VIDEO
The removal effort comes as the park conducted a larger effort last week to eliminate 3,000 invasive pine trees at the park, including three non-native pine species—the Monterey pine, the Mexican weeping pine, and the maritime pine.
According to park staff, the trees displace endemic and endangered species, change soil chemistry, and increase the potential for wildfire in habitats not adapted to fire. The removal is expected to conserve the iconic crater views and protect species that depend on native habitats for survival.
A second phase of the pine control project is scheduled to take place in the Summer of 2015.
In what would create a Rs 37 lakh crore banking behemoth, state-run giant State Bank of India will merge its five associate banks, along with Bharatiya Mahila Bank, with itself.
In a press release, SBI said its board has given in-principle approval for the bank to discuss the possibility of acquiring its associate banks.
The five associate banks are State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur and State Bank of Patiala. The BMB was created in 2013 by the erstwhile UPA government, especially to cater to women's lending needs but analysts say it has failed to take off.
"This discussion is purely exploratory at this stage and not certain," the bank's release said.
Government officials told CNBC-TV18 that no legislative changes will be required for this merger and that the process may get completed within this fiscal.
Commenting on the development, SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the the benefits of the merger would be huge.
She added that associate banks have a fixed asset worth Rs 4,000 crore and she saw lending costs reduce by 100 basis points within a year post this merger.
A private North Carolina Christian college is insisting that its faculty and staff sign a document that opposes same-sex marriage and abortion. One faculty member says she and eight of her colleagues have refused to sign it and are leaving the school.
News media outlets report that part of Montreat College's “Community Life Covenant” expects those who work there to affirm “the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman” and the “worth of every human being from conception to death.”
Covenant opponents blame the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, which contributed $100,000 to the college's scholarship fund last month. The fund is led by Franklin Graham, a Montreat College alumnus and an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage and abortion. The association has denied any role in the covenant, however.
School spokesman Adam Caress told The Charlotte Observer in an email that only two faculty members — one of its 39 full-time faculty and one of its 142 adjunct faculty — have cited the school's “core documents,” including the covenant, as the reason they will not return to the school after this semester.
Caress said Montreat College spent the past 2 1/2 years “reviewing and revising” those core documents in a “transparent and deliberative process” that included 13 “listening sessions,” during which the school heard and responded to the concerns of faculty, staff, and alumni.
Corrie Greene, an English teacher at the school who also directs its writing center, said the document doesn't just pertain to what faculty do and say in the classroom and on campus. She is among the nine faculty members who said they won't be returning.
“It says we must affirm and uphold the college's specific spiritual stances in our full 24 hour/seven-day-a-week personal life,” Greene said. “I can't let somebody else write my personal testimony. In my faith, Christ is constantly showing me something new.”
A small group of students gathered outside the school library on Wednesday to express concerns about the covenant. Sophomore Bailey Mathews organized the event and said she hoped to persuade college President Paul Maurer to “consider this a family and reconsider some things and that we can fix our broken family.”
Mathews also said she plans to leave Montreat College.
“I was going to stay and I planned on graduating from here,” she said, “but now, no.”

Seattle's greenhouse-gas emissions are on a downward trend, dropping 6 percent between 2008 and 2014, despite a building boom and a 13 percent surge in population, according to a report released Wednesday.
Seattle's greenhouse-gas emissions are on a downward trend, dropping 6 percent between 2008 and 2014 despite a building boom and 13 percent surge in population, according to a report released Wednesday by the city's Office of Sustainability and Environment.
But these emissions would have to fall a whole lot farther — and the pace of decline quicken — for the city to meet the goal set in an “action plan” of a 58 percent cut by 2030 over the 2008 baseline.
While the progress is positive, “We are currently not on pace to meet our 2030 climate goals,” wrote Jessica Fin Coven, the office's director, in a letter accompanying the report.
The biggest source of the city's greenhouse emissions is combustion of transportation fuels, 66 percent of the 2014 total. Over the six-year period, those emissions declined by 2 percent as vehicles have become more fuel-efficient and residents have been traveling fewer miles.
Lower energy use in buildings also is driving down Seattle's greenhouse-gas pollution. The 13 percent decline in building emissions reflected greater energy efficiency, more multifamily living and warmer weather that reduced heating needs.
The report also analyzed emissions generated per Seattle resident, and found that those emissions decreased 17 percent between 2008 and 2014.
Fin Coven, in her letter, noted a number of steps the city has taken to quick the pace of emission declines. They include a “Drive Clean Seattle” strategy to move the transportation sector away from fossil fuels and a proposed commercial energy code — expected to take effect next year — to increase the efficiency of new construction and substantial alterations to existing buildings.
Scientists warn that the buildup of greenhouse gases is behind climate change that could have widespread impacts, including rising sea levels.
In December, more than 190 nations came together in Paris to forge a global agreement to reduce these emissions and try to limit the global temperature rise to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.5 degrees Fahrenheit).
Yes, I believe they will!
Today, October 1, 2016 is the opening day of the last of Obama's driving efforts to change America by changing its people.
A few weeks ago he presented to Congress his determination to admit 110,000 refugees from around the world over the next 12 months with the largest numbers coming from the Middle East and Muslim-controlled countries of Africa.
But, if Hillary is elected president on November 8th, Obama will look like a piker.
No where did Obama ever say he wanted 65,000 Syrians admitted to the US, but Hillary is on record (Face the Nation, September 2015) saying that, and I am guessing that will only be the beginning for her.
After all, she just this week said that the foreign leader she admired most is German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel!!! who is widely believed to be destroying Germany and has thrown all of Europe in chaos with her ‘welcome' of any refugee from Africa and the Middle East who can get there!
Remember the other day I wrote about the fact that the number determined by the President at the end of the fiscal year for the following year is a ceiling set by the President in consultation with Congress.
‘Consultation' is a squishy term as we have seen for the last 35 years and is virtually non-existent (except for a brief chit chat between the Secretary of State and two key committees on the Hill). Each September, the President sends up his refugee numbers for the upcoming year and for years Congress simply slipped his plan into a drawer somewhere and never even held hearings. Senator Sessions' hearing last fall (2015) was the first since 9/11.
The only real power the Congress has is to limit the funding for the federal agencies involved, something I have never seen done!
So, back to Hillary and the power of the Presidency as it relates to this law.
One of Hillary's long time political allies is John Podesta, Chairman of her 2016 Presidential campaign. Do you know that his organization (an organization Hillary helped create with George Soros) proposed an AIRLIFT in 2009 of 100,000 Iraqis to America which they pushed on the new President Obama? He didn't bite.
The plan called for Iraqis to be held offshore somewhere until they could be processed in to the US. More recently Canada's boy Trudeau airlifted tens of thousands of Syrians to Canada. If President, could Hillary do this? Yes she can!
Refugee Act's emergency provision
There is a very clear provision, which I don't think has been used (the large crush of Vietnamese came before the Refugee Act of 1980 became law), but I think Hillary will use it. By defeating Donald Trump, she will feel she has a mandate to open our borders. There definitely won't be a border fence built and I predict she will use every lawful means available to admit as many migrants as she can, including the emergency provisions of the Refugee Act of 1980.
Could she add her 65,000 Syrians to the 110,000 refugees Obama proposed for FY2017, or could she go even higher? Yes, she could know that the Congress, even if Republicans still hold the majority, is weak and will be further demoralized by her win.
Heck her role model, Mama Merkel, admitted over a million in the last year. Not to look ‘unwelcoming' by comparison, Hillary could easily bump our numbers up to a quarter of a million! (That would be in addition to the masses of asylum seekers—-phony refugees—now streaming across our southern border.)
See here (Refugee Act of 1980):
Consultation with Congress, big deal! No teeth! And, I expect no fight if Hillary is in the White House!
Will Hillary go there? Yes, I believe she will.
Obama only cares if you get shot BEFORE you can beat a man to death.
While some of the circumstances are different in regards to the Trayvon Martin attempted murder of George Zimmerman and the actual murder of Delbert Belton at the hands of Demitrius Glenn and Kenan Kenard, I find some things rather telling in their respective fallouts.
Most notably, the deafening silence by those who were so outraged by Trayvon Martin being stopped before he killed Zimmerman. If it wasn't for the internet reporting on the death of Delbert Belton I doubt many would ever have heard about it. It's not like the “mainstream” media is covering it with circus-like aplomb.
And heaven forbid if anyone even hinted at the idea that two black street thugs killed an 88 year old white man based in part because of racism.
Also, did you even know the names of Demitrius Glenn and Kenan Kinard before you read this? I recall Martin and Zimmerman being household names for the past 2 years.
Then we have the president, Mr. Obama. A while back he went on the air and recounted how if he had a son, he would look just like Trayvon. First of all, big friggin deal, what does that matter other than to incite some racial overtones on the situation.
Guess what, there are probably MILLIONS of people who have grandfathers and fathers who look like Delbert Belton. President Obama being one of them.
But no. Because Delbert Belton was the wrong color his murderers won't get the added scrutiny of being racists. In fact, as I wrote yesterday, people such as the Spokane Chief of Police will even try to mitigate their crimes by saying they weren't hugged enough as children.
The more I think about it the less doubt I have that if Delbert Belton shot and killed his attackers the race baiting machine would have ratcheted up full force against him and President Obama would have found himself with 2 more imaginary sons.
Tuesday was Equal Pay Day, a day spon­sored by the National Com­mittee on Pay Equity to raise awareness of the fact that women make 79.6 cents for every dollar men make. The day was chosen because it rep­re­sents how far into 2017 women must work in order to make the same amount that men made in 2016. Their website states that “because women earn less, on average, than men, they must work longer for the same amount of pay.” This statement implies some sort of sys­tematic dis­crim­i­nation against female workers, when in fact there are many factors — con­ve­niently omitted from almost all fem­inist nar­ra­tives — that con­tribute to the so-called “wage gap.”
Pri­marily, women are more likely to take time off work for childcare, leading to less expe­rience and fewer oppor­tu­nities for career growth later in life. Some blame oppressive societal gender roles for urging women to be the care­takers of the home, but the reality is that women are less likely to devote the majority of their lives to their careers — leading to fewer overall wage earnings. Addi­tionally, women are far more likely to take lower-stress, lower-risk jobs than men — such as sec­re­taries, nursing aides, and primary edu­cation teachers — which tend to be lower-paying.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Ser­vices show that men make up 93 percent of high-risk jobs — such as mining, flight engi­neering, and law enforcement. Con­se­quently, they are far more likely than women to incur serious injuries or be killed on the job, and com­pen­sation for these risks helps to account for the exis­tence of a wage gap. In fact, a BLS report on fatal occu­pa­tional injuries found that of approx­i­mately 4,800 people killed as a result of a work-related injury in 2015, almost 4,500 of them were men — a stunning number that receives little attention when com­paring the wages of men and women.
Fur­thermore, the 79-cent figure fails to take into account dif­fer­ences in work expe­rience and par­ticular spe­cial­iza­tions within any given occu­pation — a pedi­a­trician makes less than a surgeon, just as an art pro­fessor makes less than an engi­neering pro­fessor.
According to the Michigan State Uni­versity faculty and aca­demic staff salary list for the 2012 – 2013 school year, eight of the 30 pro­fessors of civil and envi­ron­mental engi­neering were women, with fourteen pro­fessors in the department salaried at over $100,000. In the art, art history, & design department, however, 26 of the 43 pro­fessors were female. Despite having more faculty in this department, only three pro­fessors had salaries over $100,000. The dif­fer­ences in salary between the depart­ments are explained simply by supply and demand: there is more demand for expertise in engi­neering outside of academia than there is for expertise in art or art history, so those pro­fessors, be they men or women, are able to command higher salaries. The fact that there are more male engi­neers is not a result of dis­crim­i­nation, it is a result of per­sonal choice.
The truth is, the salaries for the two depart­ments showed no signs of pay dis­crim­i­nation in favor of men. In every instance of a female pro­fessor being paid less than a male pro­fessor with the same job title, the male pro­fessor had more years of expe­rience or some other salary-influ­encing factor, such as a sec­ondary job at the uni­versity. In fact, in the art department, there appeared to be reverse dis­crim­i­nation — there were three unex­plained examples of female pro­fessors who earned more than their male coun­ter­parts with the same job title and years of work expe­rience.
Most dif­fer­ences in the salaries of men and women are easily explained by com­paring other factors, such as expe­rience, dif­ferent levels of spe­cial­ization in par­ticular fields, and per­sonal choices. So, if an inequitable wage gap exists, and if it as vast as some claim, where is the evi­dence? Where are the law­suits? Where are the legal firms rep­re­senting the victims of wage dis­crim­i­nation, and where are the payroll sta­tistics from com­panies, uni­ver­sities, and orga­ni­za­tions in which women are paid less than men? They do not exist, simply because a gender-based dis­crim­i­natory wage gap does not exist. I have yet to see a fem­inist argument, based in facts rather than in gen­er­al­iza­tions, that proves oth­erwise.

Having seen all sorts of makeshift fixes – from post-it notes to bandages to condom wrappers – used to block wireless access point LEDs from beaming and sometimes blinking, some IT shops have begun turning off the lights altogether even though it can make their jobs a little tougher.
Lively discussion broke out online this week among a forum of university IT pros after one member inquired about this “first-world problem,” as he contemplates whether to disable LEDs on APs across the board in an effort to improve dorm residents' quality of life (i.e., help them grab more shuteye by reducing in-room light pollution). More than a dozen peers replied that they have indeed turned off the lights, some doing so in a wholesale manner, others taking it case by case. They say technicians can re-enable LEDs temporarily if need be for troubleshooting.
“I've disabled them when asked, because in spots where I've disabled them ‘wholesale', I invariably get a ticket (or more) that the AP is offline and wireless is broken because there are no lights on the AP,” says Rice University Senior Network Architect Danny Eaton, who works with a variety of Cisco APs. “I enable the LED, and magically the wireless performance and coverage is perfect.”
John Cosgrove, wireless network staff specialist for Penn State Health/Penn State College of Medicine, says LEDs have been disabled for testing purposes on a subset of Cisco APs in a support area, and he believes it would be “an easy global change” to disable them more widely in the name of patient satisfaction. Cosgrove has seen enough access point LEDs covered with medical tape or bandages in hospital rooms (likely by staff, adhering to patients' wishes) to know that the lights can bother patients. “It seems when you are sick and laying in a hospital bed and have trouble sleeping, the single LED shining in your eyes is an issue. I get it and understand it.”

WI-FI EVERYWHERE
Wireless APs obviously have become more ubiquitous, and increasingly are being moved out of hallways and into spaces such as dorm rooms, hospital rooms and offices. "Hallways are generally a poor choice because you really need the APs closest to clients, and walls provide separation that helps with [radio resource management] and such," says Lee Badman, the network architect within Information Technology Services at Syracuse University who sparked the original conversation online among his peers.
One result of Wi-Fi users being in closer quarters with APs, though, is that many have taken it upon themselves to make the devices glow a little less brightly even as the users benefit from the improved wireless coverage. Some users don't want a beacon shining in their eyes as they try to get to sleep and others worry about the health effects of a blue light glowing all night. Some even resort to unplugging the gear when they're not using it.
These DIY fixes are not nearly as problematic as, say, rogue IT installations that can introduce security holes and interfere with network performance. But the downside of people covering up LEDs on access points for IT is that if someone calls to report a wireless issue, they can no longer pass along info about the lights on the AP until they remove whatever they used to cover them up. Some devices feature multiple lights, while others have a single light that changes colors to convey information.
Aruba Networks Have 320 series access points from Aruba Networks brightened your day or night?
Network pros say they have begun asking vendors such as Cisco if they can provide an easier way to dim, rather than turn off the lights on the APs entirely, via wireless controllers. And some would like to see more granular control, such that the power light could be left on to comfort end users that the device is working, but blinking lights could be turned off or dimmed to avoid bothering them.
Matthias Machowinski, senior research director for enterprise networks & video at IHS Technology, says he's come across the Wi-Fi access point LED issue in reviewing consumer products for his personal consumption and understands how this could be an issue in certain enterprise environments. "If anything, this illustrates the importance of a good management system where you can make changes easily from a central console."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise company Aruba Networks says it does provide configuration options so that customers can disable LEDs in a centralized way. Indeed, Aruba has customers who want the lights off so that attention isn't drawn to APs in certain public venues, such as performing arts halls, where the aesthetics would be compromised. Aruba has also seen customers in the hospitality field turn off AP lights in guests' rooms.
So it's not like the latest APs from Cisco, Aruba and others are unsightly. It's just that in some environments, people could do with a little less light.

The last few years have seen a growing number of projects attempting to derive insights into our behaviors from our social media data.
The Gnip project, for instance, offers researchers access to the full Twitter data pipe for their studies. The access has led to a number of interesting insights, including Obamacare enrolment, possible terrorist activity, and even the income of users.
An emotional map
So it's interesting to see the Feel project attempt to use this social data to provide an accurate and real-time signal of our emotional state.
The project, which began a few years ago was documented in a recently published paper. It provides a telling example of the tool in use as it monitored the reaction to the death of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes.
It visualizes a peak of sadness, together with a clear distinction around the gender of the tweets. The tool also allows people to drill down into region, to thus allow users to explore geographic as well as gender differences in the emotion felt at that time.
By doing all of this analysis in real-time, it offers users the ability to take the emotional pulse of the world directly after significant events in a quick and easy manner.
Predicting micro-events
Whilst there are clear use-cases for large, significant events, the team also hope it can find a use in more personal issues too. For instance, the team hope that it can identify when people are at risk of depression, and how our moods fluctuate over time.
It could also provide insight into how influential external events such as the weather, time of the day or major events such as economic instability are on our general mood.
Whilst information on this kind of things is tracked via things such as the Black Dog Index, this insight is typically not delivered in real-time or on a day-to-day basis.
As such, it's certainly a useful project to keep an eye on. We've seen how valuable social data can be in generating insights in a wide range of ways, so it's a method that it seems inevitable will grow.
MONTREAL – When it comes to emblematic architecture, Quebec City can hold its own against any city in Canada. An image of the Château Frontenac, built more than a century ago on a cliff overlooking the St. Lawrence River, instantly evokes the city's charm.
But a Quebec City real-estate developer, prodded by Mayor Régis Labeaume, has decided the provincial capital needs a signature building that is a little less down-to-earth.
Last week, Groupe Dallaire announced plans for a 65-storey tower that it boasted would be the tallest Canadian skyscraper outside of Toronto — nearly twice the height of Quebec City's current tallest building.
“Over a year ago, the Mayor of Quebec City called on us to create a flagship building at the city's western gateway – a new symbol of our beautiful city that would be highly recognizable,” Michel Dallaire, the CEO of Groupe Dallaire, said. “Today, we are answering that call and delivering this one-of-a-kind project whose distinctiveness will become synonymous with the city itself and resonate far beyond our borders.”
The artists' drawings show a steel and glass construction towering above the surrounding suburbia of Sainte-Foy, with swooping shapes at its summit intended to conjure the sailing ships that once plied the St. Lawrence. An accompanying promotional video, set to stirring choral music, says the city — “carried on a wave of pride” — will be given a new iconic symbol.
Mr. Dallaire told reporters he sees his Le Phare complex, to be built on the site of a demolished hotel near the bridges that link Quebec City to the south shore, as nothing less than Quebec's own Rockefeller Center. There will be an observation deck up top and a skating rink in the plaza, but with malls and bungalows in its shadow, nobody is going to mistake the scene for Manhattan.
The prospect of leaping ahead of Montreal in the tallest-building contest appeals to some in the capital, but others are warning that the maritime-themed project will be more like a ship out of water.
In an open letter published Wednesday in Le Soleil, 325 young architects — the majority from the Quebec City region — accused the city of pursuing an outmoded form of development more suited to Dubai than Quebec.
“The Le Phare project, as it now stands, shows incredible contempt for its urban context,” the architects wrote. “This giant appears to have been designed to be seen from the greatest distance, as the bird flies; it should have been conceived to be lived on a human scale, to be sensitive, to be innovative.” In approving the project, the city “is closing its eyes on a comprehensive vision of development,” the authors wrote.
In addition to the skyscraper, the $600-million project is planned to include three “sister” towers of between 25 and 30 storeys. The complex will combine office, retail and residential space, with room for more than 2,500 workers and 2,000 residents. Plans call for construction to begin next year and last a decade.
Writing this week in La Presse, François Cardinal warned the Quebec City skyscraper will be a repeat of Paris's Montparnasse, the 1970s office tower that is a blight on the landscape. “Paris and Quebec enjoy strong personalities, signature heritage and magnificent buildings,” he wrote. “They are two elegant cities for whom skyscrapers resemble clunky jewelry, a big golden brooch that throws off the balance.”
Gérard Beaudet, a professor at the Université de Montréal's institute of urban studies, is well aware of the rivalry between Montreal and Quebec City. His criticism of Le Phare has been dismissed by some as skyscraper envy. (And it is true that under Montreal's current rules, no building could overtake Le Phare's 250 metres, because construction cannot be higher than Mount Royal.)
But he says his opposition has nothing to do with jealousy. He objects to the notion that Quebec needs a skyscraper to enter the big leagues. “When the developer says, ‘Quebec City has arrived there,' as if there is some sort of natural law that a city absolutely has to have a skyscraper at some point in its history, it's a little bizarre,” Mr. Beaudet said.
“In almost all cases of skyscrapers, they are much more to do with a fantasy than with an actual response to market conditions,” he added. “It is very hard to justify a 60- or 80-storey building by market conditions.”
But then in Quebec City, people are no strangers to fantasies. The finishing touches are being put on a $400-million, taxpayer-funded professional hockey rink set to open in September with no team on the horizon. Mr. Labeaume, who has recently come under fire for his failure to deliver on an NHL team, seemed only too happy to adopt a new “signature” project.
“This building, all modern cities in the world would be proud to have it on their territory,” he said last week as Le Phare was announced.

Renzi wants cooperation between Tripoli and Rome that recalls the Qadhafi era | Salah Malkawi/ Getty Images Italy's search for a new Libyan savior Rome hopes stability in the North African nation will protect its oil interests and stop the flow of migrants.
MILAN — Italy is pulling out all the stops to secure stability in Libya to protect its business interests and ward off another potential migration crisis on its southern shores.
It's a tough mission given the chaos that has engulfed the North African country since the 2011 toppling and killing of Muammar Qadhafi.
But Italy is getting increasingly worried about migration: A deal between the EU and Turkey is riddled with problems even before its official launch on Monday, and the Balkan migrant route north from Greece is closed, making Italy a more attractive option for those seeking a new life in Europe — both by land and by sea.
Over the past two years, divisions among Libya's political forces, each backed by its own militia, have deepened, and the country has been split between two governments: The internationally recognized one in eastern Libya and the Islamist-backed one in the capital, Tripoli.
On Wednesday, the Islamist National Salvation government in Tripoli resigned, improving the U.N.-brokered unity government's chances of asserting itself in the Libyan capital a week after its leaders arrived by ship from Tunisia.
The Government of National Accord (GNA) is led by the Chairman of the Presidential Council Fayez Serraj. It's backed by the U.S. and EU, with Italy at the forefront.
Serraj is a little-known technocrat, who sailed into Tripoli from Tunis on March 30, after militias exiled him from the Libyan port city of Tobruk.
His backers hope he will put an end to political rivalries and infighting, and save the country from the chaos that has been exploited by ISIL. The militants have captured oil terminals and fields, the main source of Libya's wealth, and swathes of territory near the coast to control the migrant smuggling network.
Serraj, who insists he sailed home on a Libyan vessel rather than an Italian ship as some allege, has pedigree. His father, Mustafa, held office under King Idris, whose 18-year monarchy ended in 1969 when he was overthrown by Qadhafi. Al-Jazeera described Mustafa Serraj as "one of the founders of the modern state of Libya after its independence from Italy."
A new, but better, relationship
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has high hopes for the younger Serraj, who worked at the housing ministry during the Qadhafi regime and was chosen as a compromise prime minister as he is not affiliated to any militia-backed political party involved in the power struggle.
Renzi wants cooperation between Tripoli and Rome that recalls the Qadhafi era, with a Libyan leader able to crack down on people-smugglers on the high seas and take on ISIL while he's at it. He's highly unlikely to get that any time soon when rival parties have greeted the unity government with gunfire rather than greetings.
On Friday, three top Libyan politicians linked to the Islamist-backed leadership in Tripoli became subject to European Union sanctions for obstructing the formation of the unity government. The three face travel bans and asset freezes.
"We hope to reach new and better agreements with the new Libyan government," Domenico Manzione, undersecretary at the Italian interior ministry, told POLITICO, playing down the amount of contact between Italy and Serraj's people. "For now, we have informal talks with the members of the Tobruk government."
Since last May, the Italian Navy has been leading Operation Sophia, a 22-country patrol mission in international waters off the coast of Libya.
While they wait to see if the Libyan unity government survives, the Italians are talking to other countries on the central Mediterranean route, to avoid a scenario where southern Italy becomes overwhelmed with migrants when the warm weather kicks in and the seas become calmer.
Last month, Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano signed an agreement with Albania on cooperation in the fight against smugglers, with Tirana promising to tighten controls on the Albanian side. Talks on similar measures are underway with Montenegro.
During last month's European Council, when the EU-Turkey deal was struck, Renzi sought assurances that concessions made to Ankara in exchange for its cooperation to curb the migrant flow to Greece would be extended to other non-EU states — such as Albania and Montenegro — if another EU member faced a similar situation.
The number of migrants reaching Italy from Libya is rising. In March, 8,405 refugees arrived, almost triple the number in the same month last year, according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). More are waiting on Libya's coast to cross, although the number varies considerably depending on who's counting: 36,000 according to the UNHCR; 800,000 says French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.
“We have gotten used to an increase of the refugee flow when approaching summer," Manzione said. "We are waiting to see if the Turkey-EU deal will succeed. If not, there could be some problems for Italy.”
In 2015, a total of 153,841 migrants came to Italy from Libya, according to the UNHCR. In the first three months of 2016, some 18,400 arrived compared to 10,165 in the same period last year.
Chasing smugglers into Libyan waters
Since last May, the Italian Navy has been leading Operation Sophia, a 22-country patrol mission in international waters off the coast of Libya. In addition to rescuing stranded migrants on the high seas, its mandate includes boarding and searching vessels, and seizing and diverting those suspected of being used for human trafficking.
In 10 months, Operation Sophia vessels have apprehended 58 suspected human smugglers and delivered them to Italian authorities. They also destroyed 98 boats and rescued more than 11,500 migrants stranded at sea, according to the European External Action Service.
Prices for crossing from Libya to Italy range from $800 and $1,200 per spot on a dingy, experts say.
But the operation could be more successful if allowed to operate closer to the Libyan coast and to chase smugglers into Libyan waters. That can only happen if the U.N.-brokered unity government is in place, and requests help.
The unity government, if it can become fully established, would have the full legitimacy to ask for Western help in dealing with ISIL. It would almost certainly need it.
According to a report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, published in May 2015, ISIL made around $300 million from human smuggling 2014. There is no available estimate for ISIL's profits from the migrant trade for last year, but with oil prices plummeting, experts say smuggling could be one of the major sources of income for the extremist group in Libya.
"They are not moving people themselves, but they are taxing the people who are," said Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute.
Prices for crossing from Libya to Italy range from $800 and $1,200 per spot on a dingy, experts say. Most refugees and asylum seekers who pay to take the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean come to Libya from Eritrea, Somalia and sub-Saharan Africa. Increasingly, however, with the Balkan route no longer reachable from Turkey through Greece, more Syrians and Afghanis are headed to Libya with the aim of entering the EU through Italy.
The reason is ENI
How Italy manages the migrant crisis depends on Libya's stability. Along with U.S. President Barack Obama, few leaders in Europe appear eager for another military intervention to achieve political change there. The reluctance on the part of some European countries appears to be down to poor prospects for the long-term stability that would pave the way for business investments.
For Italy, Libya is already big business. ENI, the Italian oil and gas giant, has a near monopoly in the North African state. ENI has been operating in Libya since 1959 and is the sole international oil and gas company operating in the country at full capacity. Its continued presence in Libya is of vital strategic importance for Italy. Keeping it there, despite huge security costs, is perhaps the biggest reason behind Rome's efforts to pacify Libya — with or without allies.
According to recent figures released by ENI, total oil production in Libya has increased from pre-conflict levels of 240,000 barrels per day to an average of 300,000 barrels per day in 2015. Last year, ENI announced that it had discovered two oilfields off the Libyan coast.
ENI wants that new oil, which is why Renzi's government is trying to keep its distance from France and the U.K., the two EU countries least opposed to another military intervention in Libya.
Rome fears that Paris and London could be motivated to take military action in order to stake a claim on Libya's natural resources — the largest proven oil reserves in Africa and the fourth largest gas reserves on the continent.
The West can train the military, supply arms, provide logistic and intelligence support, but the Libyans are the ones who have to be in the front line fighting Daesh.” — Bernardino Leon, former head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya
“There is a general mistrust among decision-makers towards a French and British intervention in Libya,” Massimo Artini, a member of the Italian parliament and its defense committee, said. "And the reason (for it) is ENI."
However, some security experts said military intervention against ISIL would become easier with the backing of a strong unity government in Libya.
In February, Peter Ricketts, British Prime Minister David Cameron's former national security adviser, tolf the BBC the likelihood of British forces being deployed in Libya was remote, "but supporting the Libyans to do a more effective job in governing their own space, I can certainly see a case for that.”
In Rome, there's a realization that Italy can't stabilize Libya on its own — either politically or militarily. That's the reason Renzi needs to make sure Rome has the leading role in international efforts to install the unity government in Tripoli, and protect it from rival militias and ISIL, and in naval operations against human smugglers.
“There is only one strategy Rome can pursue in Libya," said Vincenzo Camporini, chief of defense staff of the Italian Armed Forces until 2011. "It has to play a leading role within the international coalition even though this might not be its preferred option.”
And in that, the Italians have full backing of the Obama administration, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry repeatedly praising Renzi's leadership on Libya. Renzi's government has supported U.S. airstrikes on ISIL positions in Libya, but there is concern that any broader intervention against the militant group would prompt ISIL to send tens of thousands of migrants to Italy from the 200-kilometer stretch of the Libyan coast under its control.
'Something needs to be done'
Despite its reluctance, plans have been drawn up in Rome for military intervention and its aftermath. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni hosted a meeting of military leaders from around the world to ponder the establishment of a stabilizing force for Libya.
The Italian defense ministry confirmed that preparations are underway for a proper and prompt response to any request from a new Libyan government for help.
“There is consensus that something needs to be done," Artini said. However, he added, there is no agreement on how it should be done: Declare a no-fly zone over Libya? Send a peacekeeping force? Provide training for its forces? "Nobody really has the perfect solution,” Artini said.
Bernardino Leon, former EU special representative and head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, said the international community "needs to help the Libyans help themselves" to crush ISIL.
"The West can train the military, supply arms, provide logistic and intelligence support, but the Libyans are the ones who have to be in the front line fighting Daesh," Leon said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIL."A large international presence on the ground could be counterproductive, rising tensions instead of lowering them and dividing the country more than uniting it."
A spokesman for the Italian defense ministry confirmed that preparations are underway for a proper and prompt response to any request from a new Libyan government for help — should such a request ever come.
“Let's say the new Libyan government asks for support to train the police," the spokesman said. "We want to be able to respond and send men within 15 days of receiving the request."
This story has been updated with the resignation of the Tripoli-based Islamist-backed government.
Turkey may take unilateral action against ISIL in Syria
ANKARA
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has sent a strong signal regarding his country's readiness to take unilateral action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) following a series of attacks by the group on the border province of Kilis.“While our citizens are being martyred every day by rockets fired from the other side, what will we wait for from the allies,” Erdoğan said at an event called “Domestic and National Will in Turkish Political History.” “If so, we will pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.”“We are doing all the necessary preparations to clean the other side of the border because of the troubles being experienced in Kilis, but we haven't yet been able to receive the support that we desire from allies,” Erdoğan said.Erdoğan again accused the international coalition battling ISIL in Syria of abandoning his country to fight the jihadists on its own soil in the face of regular attacks on Kilis by ISIL.Around two dozen people have been killed in the southeastern province of Kilis by rocket fire from ISIL since January, prompting the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) to respond with artillery fire.Turkey, a member of the U.S.-led coalition battling ISIL, also allows U.S. jets to use its air base in southern Turkey for air strikes on the extremists.“The Kilis issue will serve as a litmus paper which will manifest the anti-DAESH [ISIL] coalition's sincerity,” he added.“We do not believe the sincerity of any country that has not seen rockets falling on our town as if they fell on Moscow, London, Brussels, Washington, Paris or Berlin,” he said.Turkish daily Yeni Şafak reported that a 20-strong Turkish military team crossed into Syria over the weekend on a reconnaissance mission to seek out ISIL launchers to target in artillery strikes, but this has not been officially confirmed.In its May 10 edition, The Wall Street Journal also reported that Turkey's special military force carried out an unusual weekend operation against ISIL fighters in Syria as part of a deepening campaign against the extremist group. Citing American officials, who spoke anonymously, the U.S. daily said the weekend operation was part of an expanding effort by the TSK to push ISIL away from a vital 60-mile stretch of the Turkey-Syria border that serves as the group's main lifeline.The president also said Turkey had the right to not care about those who disregarded Kilis and the Syrian city of Aleppo.“We also have the right to not care [about] those who disregard Kilis [and] Aleppo. It is not possible for us to agree either with the allies or the non-moral structure in the face of the current discourse and manners of especially European Union organizations and some countries in Turkey's fight against terrorism,” Erdoğan said, calling their stance hypocritical.“Those who stirred up the world when DAESH [ISIL] conducted attacks against them left Turkey alone in its fight against the same organization,” Erdoğan said.
Do you remember the first time you fought a southpaw? I bet it wasn't easy. If you're an orthodox fighter, everything comes from a different angle which you're just not used to seeing. Learn how to fight a southpaw effectively so that you're never confused in the ring.
If you want to learn advanced boxing techniques, then I recommend the Advanced Boxing Workshop which covers improvement on footwork, balance and punching power.
Please note: This article is based on an orthodox vs southpaw point of view.
Basic Checks When Fighting a Southpaw
Establish Lead Foot Outside (1)
Whoever manages to get their lead foot on the outside will likely control the fight because they would be in a better position to attack and move. So basically, you must always have your left foot on the outside of your opponent's right foot. There are several ways in which you can do this:
Walk Over: If your opponent doesn't know about feet positioning, then chances are you can just walk over to the outside quite easily.
Sidestep Jab: While you're double/triple jabbing, you sidestep at the same time to get into the correct position. The jab serves as a distraction and can also set up your cross.
Bob & Weave / Slip: When your southpaw opponent is on the offensive, bob and weave or slip punches but move to your left while doing so, and in one swift movement you can have your foot positioned outside his right foot.
In this position, you can easily throw the jab, left hook and cross to the body or head. For the southpaw, all the punches will come from angle that's slightly sideways and if you continue to circle to your left, you can even land shots that the southpaw won't even see coming.
Circle to Your Left (2)
Once you have your lead foot firmly established on the outside, make sure that you circle in that direction also, even when you're jabbing away. By doing this, you're not only constantly in position to throw your cross, but you also take away the southpaw cross. Therefore, you only have to watch out for jabs and the right hook from a southpaw.
If your opponent has your feet trapped to the inside which prevents you from circling to your left, you can do the following:
Get out of Range
If you're mid-close range and your lead foot is on the inside, then either maneuver yourself backwards or to the side so that you're out of punching range. You can do this by bouncing backwards with your hands up or simply stepping back out. This resets your foot positioning so that you can attempt to establish your lead foot on the outside again.
Clinch
If you're on the inside and out of punching position, then one of the smartest things you can do is to clinch instead of trying to punch your way out or cover up. Clinching is an art in itself, so you must learn how to clinch in a variety of positions. After you clinch, the referee will break it up and reset your positions.
Pivot Anti-Clockwise
Another way to get out the trap of having your lead foot on the inside when you're up close is to duck under the southpaw left cross (which causes him to fall in), then pivot your lead foot anti-clockwise so that you end up on your opponent's left side.
This in turn causes him to turn orthodox and he'll be open for your right cross or overhand right.
Attacking a Southpaw
The Jab
Double / Triple Jab
As explained above, you can use the double and triple jab to circle to your left and get within range to position yourself for your right cross. Everytime you throw the jab, you may notice your opponent dipping down to his left to avoid your right cross.
Southpaws usually have the tendency to do this. If this is so, then you can feint the jabs so that he bends at the waist, then throw the right cross to where his head will be.
Jab to the Body
The closest target on a southpaw for an orthodox fighter is the right side of his body. You can easily jab that area of his body to distract him downstairs, which is a great way to set up the right cross upstairs. Mix up the jab to the head and body along with some feints to really confuse your southpaw opponent.
The Right Cross
Right Cross to the Body
Since the closest target for the orthodox fighter would be the right side of the southpaw body, you can throw the cross by setting it up with a jab upstairs.
Right Cross to the Head
You can set up the right cross to the head with either a jab to the body or by circling to your left while jabbing. Another very effective way to land the right cross is to throw it at the same time as your opponent throws his southpaw jab (see clip on the right).
This requires good timing but catches your opponent completely off guard. You can bait his jab out by throwing a feint jab of your own. Do it enough and your opponent will begin to neglect his jab in fear of eating a counter.
The Left Hook
Left Hook to the Head / Body
Presuming that you're already have your lead foot on the outside, you can easily throw your left hook to the head or body. This can be set up by your right cross or thrown independently. Your opponent will be trying to establish his lead foot on the outside so your left hook is very important to stop him from moving into that direction.
Instead, you have to use your left hook to move your opponent to his left so that he's in line with your cross. George Foreman vs Michael Moorer is a great example of this.
Counter Left Hook
To really offset your opponent's offense and rhythm, you have to make him miss and then make him pay. Doing so will make your opponent think twice about attacking and may even lead him to become defensive minded throughout the rest of the fight.
Your best weapon for countering the southpaw would be your left hook. If he tries to shoot his jab or cross to your body, throw the left hook at the same time while pulling back or pivoting your lead foot and swinging your back foot clockwise to get out of harm's way.
The Uppercut
Uppercut to the Body
If you duck under your opponent's left cross, you will find yourself in a position (if you're not too low) where you can throw your rear uppercut to his body. This is an excellent counterpunch opportunity. As soon as he throws the left cross, bend your knees and waist slightly and then immediately shoot the uppercut down the middle at his solar plexus.
Defending Against a Southpaw
Pivot Clockwise
To avoid the left cross and right hook from a southpaw, one of the best ways is to pivot your lead foot and swing your back foot clockwise while leaning your body back slightly. Exactly as if you were throwing the counter left hook as explained above. If this is done correctly, you'll end up further to your left practically facing the back of the southpaw's right shoulder.
Also, If you don't have your lead foot established on the outside when doing this, then you'll end up tripping over your opponent's lead foot.
Duck Under
You can duck under the southpaw right hook or left cross when it comes in. Remember to bend your knees and bend at the waist but when you do, if you're close enough, then it's a good idea to use your left shoulder to push against your opponent's stomach or pivot clockwise (if your lead foot is on the outside like it should be).
The problem with ducking under punches is that you have very limited offensive options. You can only really throw the rear uppercut to the body or the head which is a much harder target to hit.
Recommended Orthodox vs Southpaw Fights
Floyd Mayweather Jr vs Zab Judah
In the beginning, Judah was using his speed to give Mayweather trouble with his left cross. He even knocked Mayweather off-balance and possibly down (wasn't counted by ref) with his right hook as Mayweather was throwing his cross to the body.
However, Mayweather adjusted and started to take over the fight by throwing lead right crosses, even doubling them up. He would often follow up with quick short left hooks to the head and body of Judah.
Erik Morales vs Manny Pacquiao I
In the first fight of their trilogy, Morales already knew too well about Pacquiao's devastating left cross, so he would watch out for it constantly and counterpunch him with left hooks, right crosses and overhand rights, until Pacquiao had been backed into the ropes or in the corner, then would unload with punches. Morales would outbox the southpaw brawler Pacquiao and win a unanimous decision.
Lucas Matthysse vs Demarcus Corley
Corley is known as a slick southpaw who's a veteran in the game, having fought some of the best fighters of his time. However, Matthysse who's a huge puncher outboxed and outfought Corley by using lateral moving and combinations.
But his primary weapon was the left hook to the body (often set up by his right cross), which knocked Corley down 6 times (8 KD's in total) and ended the fight.
Beating a Southpaw
Your footwork is the most important thing when it comes to fighting a southpaw, so get a southpaw partner to move about in the ring with you without throwing any punches. Instead, concentrate on always maneuvering yourself into the correct positions to land punches.
When you're on the heavy bag, make a habit of circling to your left while jabbing at the same time. Familiarize yourself with the southpaw style by sparring as many southpaws as you can as it's always the best way to prepare for real competition.

More Top 10 Best in DT New West
A Columbia Waterfront District restaurant is upping its weekend drinking age to combat the presence of all those annoying, drunken young'uns.
DNAinfo reports that Phil's Crummy Corner, located at 323 Columbia Street, Brooklyn, will only serve alcohol to patrons 25 and older on weekend nights. The decision comes after hordes of complaints from nearby residents about rowdy, loud late-night crowds—often present at the “family restaurant” until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays.
Now, 21-24-year-olds will have to look elsewhere for their vodka-Redbulls. Phil's manager, Isabel Santiago, explained the restaurant's surprisingly cooperative decision to DNAinfo: “Their quality of life is our concern,” she said, presumably referring to the masses of binge-drinking youths known to frequent her establishment. Phil's is apparently working to create a “quiet family place,” and has recently hired a bouncer. Community Board 6 and the NYPD have also discussed increasing police presence around Phil's on weekend nights.
The complaints were so intense that the restaurant became the subject of a meeting on Monday between the Community Board and the 76th Precinct, where locals showed up to air their grievances.
“You will be shocked about the number of conversations you can hear from my bed,” said a resident who lives near Phil's. “They're animals. Friday and Saturday night, it's like animal town.”
“I just care about being able to sleep on Friday and Saturday nights,” another local said. “That's all I care about.”
The past year has also seen 22 311 calls reporting loud revelry in and around the vicinity of Phil's.
The complainers might sound like total lame-os unwilling to relive their college glory years, but maybe their complaints aren't so unfounded. Back in September, outside Phil's, a 25-year-old woman was kicked and punched by a gang of four attackers. And in April, police arrested a male Phil's patron for punching a female victim in the face, and later found him to be carrying 18 bags of marijuana.
We wouldn't want to live near Phil's either. But on the other hand, it still sounds better than working next to Times Square.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shana Pezaro said she noticed improvements to her MS symptoms within days of taking the HIV drugs
A woman with multiple sclerosis (MS) says her symptoms improved so dramatically she was able to walk again after being prescribed HIV drugs.
Shana Pezaro, 36, from Hove, East Sussex, was given antiretroviral drugs after fearing she may have contracted HIV.
Within days, Miss Pezaro noticed an easing of her MS symptoms.
When a doctor saw her walking upstairs after years of using a wheelchair he set up a clinical trial.
Multiple sclerosis is an incurable condition that can lead to sight loss, pain, fatigue and disability. It affects around 100,000 people in the UK.
Miss Pezaro was a dancer and piano teacher before being diagnosed with MS at the age of 28. The condition affected her hands and feet and she used a wheelchair.
Multiple sclerosis
In MS the coating around the nerve fibres is damaged causing a range of symptoms
Once diagnosed there is no cure, but treatments can help manage the condition
MS affects almost three times as many women as men
Physical symptoms of MS might commonly include vision problems, balance problems and dizziness, fatigue, bladder problems and stiffness and/or spasms
MS can affect memory and thinking and also can have an impact on emotions
(Source: Multiple Sclerosis Society)
About a year ago, Miss Pezaro thought she may have been exposed to HIV and her doctor prescribed emergency antiretroviral drugs.
"Three days after I took the drugs I walked up a flight of stairs," she said.
"That was an unbelievable, massive change."
Image caption "I didn't do steps," Shana Pezaro said
Prof Julian Gold from the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, saw a video of Miss Pezaro climbing the stairs and a clinical trial was set up to look at the impact of single or combination antiretroviral drugs on MS patients.
An earlier study led by Dr Gold conducted with Queen Mary University, London and the University of Oxford showed an association between HIV and MS.
They reported antiretroviral treatment may suppress other viruses such as those which may cause MS.
Dr Gold said: "The next stage of the investigation is to use a very similar combination [of HIV drugs] that Shana took. I think that might be quite optimistic."
A spokeswoman for the MS Society said: "Our growing understanding tells us that viruses have a role to play in multiple sclerosis and it will be interesting to see the trial results - positive findings mean another step on the road to beating MS."
Analysis: BBC South East health correspondent, Mark Norman
Shana and Dr Gold would be very keen not to raise any false hope.
The study builds on a lot of work already done with HIV patients who simply don't get multiple sclerosis.
This is really about finding a cause and increasingly people think the cause may be a virus.

Returning the favor, Greenberg showed him around the Microsoft campus and introduced him to as many people as he could, even barging into Xbox chief Phil Spencer's office without an appointment so Wigal could tell his story. "Phil was probably on the phone, but I didn't care," Greenberg told me. "[Wigal] is doing great work, so I raised my hand and said I'm gonna be his hype man."
In 2016, GO received a gift through Microsoft's corporate giving campaign. One philanthropic event involved a pie-throwing contest. Employees bought tickets, exchanged them for tinfoil pans full of whipped cream and hurled them at management. Greenberg was a willing target . In one day, Microsoft employees raised $5,000 for the foundation. For an idea of how many pies he caught with his face, Greenberg told me the next day he still smelled like Cool Whip and even had some lodged in his ears.
He didn't stop at taking pies to the face. Using the GO fundraising platform, he recruited others to help fill Seattle Children's Hospital's need for an additional nine Karts. Using his position in the gaming industry, Greenberg reached out to people like Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, Electronic Arts exec Peter Moore and HoloLens creative director Kudo Tsunoda to donate and help spread the word online. Even electronic musician Steve Aoki got in on the action.
"We play our games, and we love gaming as an art form," Greenberg said, "but to be able to tie it back to something where [games] mean even more to kids in hospitals? I don't know how to describe the feeling I get."
Greenberg paid for two Karts out of pocket, and tasked the gaming community to raise the additional funds for the remaining seven. With high-profile streamers helping out, Greenberg's fundraising campaign brought in $12,599. Streaming app Infiniscene, a 2016 Gamers for Giving sponsor, matched those donations, pushing the total past $25,000. Greenberg said this success overshadowed all the work he'd done for Microsoft in 2016 -- including launching Forza Horizon 3 and Gears of War 4.
"It was the most important thing I focused on this holiday," he said.
Expanding into more facilities is Wigal's ultimate goal. More visibility thanks to celebrity endorsements will ultimately advance that mission, but it isn't the point. However, Wigal expressed deep gratitude for the work people like Greenberg have done for GO.
"I see it as a pathway for growth," he said. "But not the pathway." The real method for expansion is empowering gamers to fundraise, getting the word out about the foundation and combining those with in-house fabrication. As of this writing, there are more than 50 fundraising campaigns listed on the GO website at various stages of completion. But all the fundraising campaigns in the world won't do much good if GO can't supply the Karts to hospitals.
A list of youtube channels that talks about programming
Here are the Youtube channels I subscribe and recommend. They are in no particular order.
I'm an old school programmer and this fits my taste perfectly well. Especially check out the Oral Histories section where they have in-depth interviews with the industry legends from top IT companies.
Mainly about Ruby conference videos recordings, even though I don't know Ruby I still find some of their videos extremely helpful.
Another general purpose programming conference channel, the speakers there are quite good, like Venkat Subramaniam.
His Android and Design Pattern courses are the best. Also if you want to learn C++, check out his course Intermediate Software Design.
He is the king of developer soft skills. Teaches you how to negotiate salary and be successful in your career. If you still think coding is the only thing you should be caring about, you need to check out his videos RIGHT NOW!
Another good source of conference recordings. Created for developers, by developers.
This guy has a very impressive programming books collection, I mainly watched his book collection videos for fun.
Explain complex computer science topics by experts in a fun way. Really to the point and also informative. Come on they have Prof Brian Kernighan for several episodes.
Yet another conference channel, their collection is truly impressive.
One Clojure function each video. Watch it if you want to expand your Clojure toolbox.
I think this is one of the first channels which is doing devlog for games. If you want to be an indie game developer, watch this video and see how hard you have to work! I pretty much enjoyed it.
Talks about open source projects. I think I watched the Emacs Org mode video more than 10 times, I love Carsten Dominik's accent so much.
Another conference channel, one of the first ones that I subscribed to.
I mainly watch their Emacs videos.
A Clojure conference located in Berlin.
Great show hosted by two amazing Android ladies.
THE clojure conference channels on Youtube.
Android conference in Berlin.

Berlin Emacs user group.
A Python conference in Europe.
Great resource to learn Krita, a Linux painting software. Also talks about how to make graphics for games.
This guy's Linux geeky stuff is mind blowing.
Every game developer or even every software developer should watch this. EPIC! Warning: he is against OOP.
Learn how to configure all parts of Linux.
The talks are very poorly recorded but very witty and pragmatic.
The academic meme weirdo.
If you ask me which programmer I want to become one day, this is the answer. And he is from Helsinki, I might even take the bus he was driving when he was a bus driver. One last word about him, I understand NONE of his videos.
His voice is gold. People pay him to rant.
The queen of Emacs!!!! Her Emacs Hangout videos are epic.
He teaches you programming in a fun way.
If you want to spend money on learning JavaScript, put them in his pocket.

Good relaxing music with good Japan scenery to relax your mind.
Another good conference that focus on code instead of process.
I will keep growing this list, so stay tuned!
LONDON — Urban Outfitters has been forced to remove an "irresponsible" ad that features a model that looks "underweight" from its website by the Advertising Standards Authority.
A complainant said the model in the picture advertising women's briefs was "unhealthily thin" according to the ruling. The ASA upheld the complaint, and ordered the retailer to remove the photo from its website.
The advert has been banned by the UK's ASA. Image: Urbanoutfitters.com
"The ASA considered that the model was very thin, and noted, in particular, that there was a significant gap between the model's thighs, and that her thighs and knees were a similar width," the ruling states. "We considered that the model looked underweight in the picture."
"We understood that Urban Outfitters' target market was young people and considered that using a noticeably underweight model was likely to impress upon that audience that the image was representative of the people who might wear Urban Outfitters' clothing, and as being something to aspire to. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible."
Jo Swinson, the UK's Minister for Women and Equalities Jo Swinson endorsed the ruling, and said that a diverse range of mannequins and models can help challenge low body confidence among women.
Urban Outfitters responded to the complaint, telling the ASA that they didn't believe the model in the photo was underweight. They provided a copy of her agency profile and other photographs and stated that her waist size was 23.5 inches.
While the offending image has been banned, their site isn't short on similar pictures.

The company came under fire recently for selling "blood-stained" Kent State sweatshirts, which evoked memories of the Kent State Massacre at the Ohio university in 1970.
Topshop, meanwhile, was criticised for its skinny mannequins last October.
The shooting death of a woman along the San Francisco waterfront has inflamed the already contentious national debate over illegal immigration, with the Obama administration accusing local officials of releasing the suspected shooter in defiance of efforts to deport him.
The latest clash over the nation's 11.3 million illegal migrants began after the death Wednesday of Kathryn Steinle, 31, who was shot in the upper torso as she walked with her father at a popular tourist destination. San Francisco police swarmed the area and arrested a man an hour later, police said.
It turned out that the suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had seven felony convictions stretching back to 1991 and had been deported from the United States five times. San Francisco authorities released him from custody in April after drug charges against him were dropped, despite an urgent request from the Department of Homeland Security that he be deported a sixth time to his native Mexico, federal and local officials said.
In a strongly worded statement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, said the San Francisco officials ignored ICE's request for a heads-up before Lopez-Sanchez was let go. “As a result, an individual with a lengthy criminal history, who is now the suspect in a tragic murder case, was released onto the street rather than being turned over to ICE for deportation,'' said Gillian Christensen, an ICE spokeswoman.
Local authorities have accused DHS of failing to respect San Francisco's status as a “sanctuary city” for undocumented immigrants that limits their ability to cooperate. “We're not seeking to turn over illegal immigrants to federal custody,'' said one San Francisco law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is unfolding.

Lopez-Sanchez, 45, was expected to be formally charged late Monday in Steinle's death, officials said. It is unclear if he has an attorney.
The unusual federal-state dispute highlights the charged nature of the immigration debate, which is emerging as a key issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. Republican candidate Donald Trump escalated the rhetoric last month, describing Mexicans entering the country illegally as “rapists” and “murderers.” Trump has since blasted San Francisco authorities for what he called their mishandling of the Lopez-Sanchez case.
Tensions have also been building in recent years between DHS and police over how to handle undocumented immigrants taken into custody, with about 300 communities nationwide ending or scaling back their participation in DHS's Secure Communities program. It allowed ICE to ask police departments that had arrested someone ICE wanted to deport to hold the immigrants beyond their scheduled release so federal agents could pick them up.
DHS secretary Jeh Johnson ended Secure Communities in November, replacing it with a new Priority Enforcement Program. Under this plan, ICE will ask to be notified before the scheduled release of an immigrant targeted for deportation.
Though that program won't take effect until later this summer, ICE was following the new guidelines when it sought in March to be notified prior to Lopez-Sanchez's release. He had been turned over to San Francisco authorities that month on a local arrest warrant for a drug charge, after he finished serving a federal sentence for illegally re-entering the country.
Sanctuary laws are in the national spotlight after an illegal immigrant with prior deportations and a criminal history pleaded not guilty to murdering a woman at a San Francisco pier. Here is what you need to know about what those laws and how they protect illegal immigrants. (Jayne W. Orenstein and Osman Malik/The Washington Post)
But the drug charge, involving a 20-year-old marijuana case, was dropped, and ICE was not told when Lopez-Sanchez was released April 15. “That's what's so mind-boggling about this case,'' said one federal official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity. “It seems that anyone with a modicum of good sense would have said this is not a guy who should be put back on the street.''
One of the big moral issues with the Quran is its explicit permission to have sex with female captives of war. Some believers claim that Islam came with the perfect moral system and way of life, and that Prophet Muhammad was the primary example of this type of perfection. Does the Quran really allow this? We will look at this first and then quote hadith next.
Let us look at the evidence:
Allah says in the Quran,
وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ
إِلَّا عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ
And those who guard their private parts
Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they are not to be blamed – Surah Maarij 70:29-30
Also this is repeated in Surah Muminuun:
وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ
إِلَّا عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ
And they who guard their private parts
Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed – (Quran 23:5-6)
Ibn Kathir and Al-Jalalayn in their tafseers say that “right hands possess” means slave girls
IslamQA in this fatwa explains that Intercourse with a slave girl is not considered Adultery
Allaah has permitted intimacy with a slave woman if the man owns her. This is not regarded as adultery
Also See What is a “right hand servant”? Does the owner of a “right hand servant” have to be married?
Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The reason why a person may be taken as a slave is his being a kaafir and waging war against Allaah and His Messenger. If Allaah enables the Muslims who are striving and sacrificing their lives and their wealth and all that Allaah has given them to make the word of Allaah supreme over the kaafirs, then He allows them to enslave the kuffaar when they capture them, unless the ruler chooses to free them or to ransom them, if that serves the interests of the Muslims. If a mujaahid takes possession of a female slave or male slave, it is permissible for him to sell them. In either case – whether one acquires a slave through battle or through purchase – it is not permissible for a man to have intercourse with a female slave until she has had a period from which it may be ascertained that she is not pregnant. If she is pregnant then he must wait until she gives birth.
Prophet Muhammad himself owned many slaves, 16 male ones according to this list. His female slaves included: Salma, Maymoonah bint Sa'd; Khadrah; Radwa; Razeenah; Umm Dameerah; Maymoonah bint Abi ‘Usayb; Maariyah and Rayhaanah.
Is it too much to ask that Prophet Muhammad not partake in the slave trade and enjoying personal benefits (sexually and otherwise) from slavery?
Is it too much to ask that Allah would have asked Muslim men to free and marry their female slaves first before having sex with them?
There is a story about him sleeping with some of his female slaves and making certain wives angry, but that is a story for another day.
Read more at Muhammad and his female captives (Answering Islam)
Slavery also had continued in the Muslim world almost until the 20th century. Read more at Wikipedia on Arab slave trade
Arab slave trade was the practice of slavery in the Arab world, mainly in Western Asia, North Africa, Southeast Africa, the Horn of Africa and certain parts of Europe (such as Iberia and Sicily) beginning in the era of the Roman Empire and continuing until the early second half of the 20th century. The trade was conducted through slave markets in the Middle East, North Africa and the Horn of Africa, with the slaves captured mostly from Africa's interior.
Although not necessarily condoned by Islam, the fact that the Quran explicitly allows slavery must have been one factor leading to certain people continuing to trade in slaves. From my understanding, Islam only allows slaves that are captured as prisoners of war, not slavery done by kidnapping or otherwise. So I do not know if the arab slave trade would be officially condoned by the Quran & Sunnah, but it is a real problem that existed in the Muslim world for a very long time.
Back when I was Muslim, many many years ago I had a fellow Muslim brother (who was in Hizbut Tahrir) tell me that in Islam, the awrah for slave girls does not include their chest. Thus some slave girls were not allowed to cover their chests. Apparently they even have a fatwa about this. I was really shocked when I heard this.

Examining Slaves” by Ettore Cercone, 1890, obtained online
Apparently there is evidence for this claim:
Narrated through Hamad Ibn Salama from Thamana Ibn Abdullah Ibn Anas from his grandfather Anas who said: “The slave-girls of Umar were serving us with uncovered hair and their breasts were shaking/wobbling ( تضطرب).” Al-Albani: The chain of this Hadeeth is ‘Jayyid' (at a level between Hasan and Saheeh) and all of it's narrators are trustworthy except the teacher of Bayhaqi Abul Qasim Abdul Rahman Ibn Ubaidullah Al-Harbi and he is very Truthful as Al-Khatib says and Al-Bayhaqi said: “And the reports from Umar Ibn Al-Khattab concerning that matter are authentic.” Ref: Irwa Al-Ghalil. Vol. 6, Pg. # 204 Umar hit the slave women from the family of Anas ibn Malik, when he saw them covered and said, “Uncover your head, and do not resemble the free women.” – Abd al-Razzaq al-Sanani (d. 211 AH/826 CE) in Al-Musannaf. (Arab women pre-islam)
And here is another reference. The prominent Hanafi jurist, Imam Ibn Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) provides us with answers to these two questions in his authoritative work, Radd al-Muhtar.
Imam Ibn Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) expounds on the issue of a slave-woman's Awra. He states here and in another chapter of his work that the Awra of a slave-woman (excluding one's own) is similar to the Awra of a Mahram woman, in that it is permissible to see of a slave-woman that which is permitted to see of a Mahram woman. The area between the navel up to and including the knees was understandable but there was a need to define the stomach and back. As such, he clarifies what precisely is meant by the stomach and back and stipulates clearly that the chest including the breasts and the area parallel to the chest from the back are not considered to be part of the Awra of a slave-woman and a Mahram. Thus, strictly speaking, it is not necessary for a woman to cover these parts in front of a Mahram male. Similarly, it is stated in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya: “It is okay for a man to see from his mother, mature daughter, sister and all other Mahram women such as grandmothers, grandchildren, paternal and maternal aunts, at their: hair, chest, locks, breasts, forearms (shoulders) and shins. It is not permissible to look at their back, stomach and the area between the navel and (including the) knees.”(Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, 5/328)
We read in Sunan al-Kubra by Imam Beyhaqi:
عن نافع ، عن ابن عمر ” أنه كان إذا اشترى جارية كشف عن ساقها ووضع يده بين ثدييها و على عجزها
Nafe'e narrated that whenever Ibn Umar wanted to buy a slave-girl, he would inspect her by analysing her legs and placing his hands between her breasts and on her buttocks”
Irwa al-Ghalil [6:201] by Sheikh Albani states:
أن ابن عمر كان يضع يده بين ثدييها ( يعني الجارية ) وعلى عجزها من فوق الثياب ويكشف عن ساقها
“Ibn `Umar (ra) used to put his hand between her [meaning the jariya's] breasts and on her haunch from above (her) clothes and used to unveil her leg.”
Sheikh Hamza Yusuf says,
In an Islamic system in Medina there were women walking around bare breasted, and that is a fact, that is a historical fact and you can read it and look it up in the books. Umar did not allow the ima (slave girl) to wear the hijab. Source: Video on Youtube at 1min 16seconds
I find this quite strange, you can look at her breasts but not her stomach?
Also, A female cannot marry her slave. How strange! IslamQA states:
It is haraam for a slave to marry his mistress. Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that marriage of a woman to her slave is invalid. Al-Athram narrated, with his isnaad from Abu'z-Zubayr, who said: I asked Jaabir about a slave marrying his mistress, and he said: A woman came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, when we were in al-Jaabiyyah. She had married her slave, and ‘Umar rebuked her and thought of stoning her, and he said: He is not permissible for you. If a woman owns her husband [i.e., if he is a slave or she bought him, for example], her marriage becomes invalid. End quote.
How one sided Islamic law is.

Zakir Naik discusses whether sex with a slave woman is allowed (YouTube)
He basically says its allowed because it was a gradual prohibition and everyone was promiscuous back then. But my question would be, why was alcohol eventually forbidden but slavery not? Also, he says slavery is allowed in Islam, why not, because Islamic law is far superior to how people are treated in Guantanamo Bay. Hmm, okay.

RECOVERY workers at Ground Zero have discovered hundreds of gold ingots, part of a billion dollar cache which was lost when the twin towers fell.
Workers clearing rubble in a service tunnel underneath one of the collapsed World Trade Centre buildings found themselves surrounded by more than 100 armed FBI and secret service personnel, who had been tipped off by the owners where the gold was buried.
The collapsed buildings contained a number of vaults and strongrooms, but the police were not saying who owned the gold.
The Comex metals trading division of the New York Mercantile Exchange kept 3,800 gold bars — weighing 12 tonnes and worth more than $100 million (£70 million) — in vaults in the building's basement. Comex also held almost 800,000 ounces of gold there on behalf of others with a value of about $220 million. It also held more than 102 million ounces of silver, worth $430 million.
The Bank of Nova Scotia, which kept gold in the Comex vault, reported $200 million of gold lost in the wreckage. Comex also held precious metals for Chase Manhattan Bank, the Bank of New York and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking.
The vaults higher up the towers became burial chambers on September 11 as some workers tried in vain to protect themselves from the fire and smoke by taking refuge inside them.
The gold, which was discovered on Tuesday, was being transported through the basement of the building on the morning of September 11. Recovery workers reached a service tunnel and discovered a ten-wheel lorry and a number of cars which had been crushed by falling steel.
A temporary ramp was built to gain access to the tunnel and a small bulldozer was used to break through a wall. Then a team of police and firefighters arrived to put the gold into an armoured bullion lorry. Other workers were told to make themselves scarce. “If I tried to go down there they would have shot me,” one said.
Eight years ago, when the World Trade Centre was bombed by terrorists, more than $1 billion in gold was being kept in the basement vaults, the property of the Kuwaiti Government. The vaults withstood the blast.
At first police believed the terrorist attack was an attempted gold robbery. Since then the amount of gold kept under the World Trade Centre has been a carefully guarded secret.
Having a party? Have no idea what to serve? Well, what else than Fish Assholes? Fish Assholes are always a popular d'oeuvres during formal events, sock hops, graduation parties, or even the occasional funeral. For an easy way to whip up some Fish Assholes, all you need is a stick of butter, crackers, a screwdriver, and of course, Fish Assholes. What you need to do is simple, you take the screwdriver, and you create a hole from one end of the stick of butter to the other end. You then place the Fish Assholes in this hole, and you microwave it for two seconds. After that, you need to take it out of the microwave, and you place crackers in between the stick of butter with Fish Assholes on the inside. The French like to call this delight Trou du cul du poisson rempli de beurre avec des craquelins en elle.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The trial of Michael Brelo, the Cleveland police officer charged in the deaths of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams following a police chase and shooting on Nov. 29, 2012, begins today.

Follow our coverage of the trial beginning at 9 a.m.
5:20 p.m. The proceedings end for the day. The prosecution says six expert witnesses are expected later this week. Judge O'Donnell says he plans to visit the East Cleveland scene of the shooting on Friday.
On Tuesday, an East Cleveland officer and a BCI representative are expected to testify. It's possible that members of Williams' and Russell's families will testify, too, according to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.
Follow our live coverage of the trial again tomorrow beginning at 9 a.m.
5:08 p.m. Royster questions Nan again about whether he believes police followed their training the night of the chase and shooting. Nan says some officers' actions during the chase and shooting did not follow training. He said they were reacting to a threat.
4:56 p.m. Mack asks Nan if, based on what he knew in the moment and what he heard on the radio transmissions, he and his fellow officers should've acted in the same manner.
"Yes," Nan says.
Mack then asks if it was the most intense incident Nan has been involved in.
"Without a doubt," Nan says.
4:41 p.m. Mack asks Nan whether he heard officers talking about a gun on the 22-minute recording, prior to another officer saying there was no gun involved. Mack also asks Nan whether he heard an officer say the Chevrolet's driver attempted to run over another officer during the chase. Nan says yes.
Mack is now asking Nan to read parts of a transcript of the recording.
4:30 p.m. The trial resumes with defense attorney Fernando Mack questioning Nan. Mack asks Nan about his record with the Cleveland Division of Police. Nan says he's been involved in "quite a few" incidents in which officers fired shots.
Nan reiterates that he believed the loud boom he heard the night of the chase and shooting was gunfire.
4:12 p.m. Judge O'Donnell announces a 10-minute break before the defense has an opportunity to question Nan.
4:10 p.m. Royster asks Nan to read a summary of the statement he made to BCI investigators before questioning him about it.
3:55 p.m. Royster asks Nan whether he now believes the loud boom he heard coming from the Chevrolet was the sound of the car backfiring. Nan says no.
3:54 p.m. The recording has finished playing. Royster replays a portion in which an officer says the driver does not have a gun in his hand. The officer says on the recording that the driver was wearing black gloves.
3:38 p.m. The police radio transmissions can be heard here.
3:34 p.m. The prosecution is now playing a recording of police radio communications from the night of the chase and shooting. The recording is approximately 22 minutes long, prosecutor Sherrie Royster says.
3:27 p.m. Nan says he reported the description of the car and told dispatch he believed he heard shots. He attempted to follow the car but soon lost track of it, he said.
3:17 p.m. The next witness is Cleveland police officer Vasile Nan, who was parked in front of the Justice Center when he heard a loud boom come from the Chevrolet. He said he believed the boom was a gunshot.
"When it passed me, I heard what I described as a gunshot, and I got startled," Nan said.
3:01 p.m. Jordan says he felt badly that he was unable to stop the car on East 18th Street, to prevent the chase and shooting from happening.
2:57 p.m. Jordan says he went back to the 2100 block of Lakeside Avenue and spoke with several people he'd seen gathered around the car to get information about its occupants.
Jordan says he did not see the Chevrolet's driver or passenger holding a gun, and he did not realize the car was the one involved in the chase until the following morning.
2:49 p.m. When Jordan approached the car he heard a woman screaming obscenities, asking why he was bothering them.
The driver ignored Jordan's order to turn off the car and instead drove off. Jordan followed the car for several blocks before losing sight of it.
Jordan says he did not recognize the woman and did not see the driver's face.
2:44 p.m. Jordan says he first saw the Chevrolet Malibu in the 2100 block of Lakeside Avenue, an area known for its connection to drug activity. Five or six people were gathered around the car at the time, he says.
Two people got into the car and drove away, and Jordan followed the car to East 18th Street near Superior Avenue. He stopped the car for failure to use a blinker.
2:37 p.m. The trial resumes.
The prosecution's first witness is Cleveland police officer John Jordan, who told investigators that he attempted to stop Russell's car on East 18th Street near Superior Avenue because he suspected the occupants were involved in drug activity.
2:28 p.m. Here's NEOMG reporter Ida Lieszkovsky's story and video recapping today's opening statements.
1:05 p.m. Judge O'Donnell announces a 90-minute break until about 2:35 p.m.
Cleveland Officer John Jordan, who first saw Russell's Chevrolet in the 2100 block of Lakeside Avenue, will testify this afternoon, Bell says.
Other law enforcement officers are expected to testify too, he says.
12:55 p.m. Judge O'Donnell says he will consider whether to visit the chase route and the scene of the shooting, and that his expectation is that will happen at some point during the trial. Brelo requested a bench trial (a trial by judge) in lieu of a jury trial.
12:51 p.m. D'Angelo concludes his opening statement by reiterating his belief that Brelo's actions were justified.
12:46 p.m. D'Angelo says the prosecution's theory about the chase and shooting shaped the investigation.
12:31 p.m. D'Angelo says Brelo didn't jump on the car because he wanted to "be Rambo," but because he believed he was in danger.
12:29 p.m. D'Angelo says Brelo reloaded his gun a second time while he was standing on the hood of a patrol car or on the Chevrolet. At that time Brelo believed he was still in danger, he says.
12:24 p.m. In their opening statements, prosecutors said Brelo fired 15 of the final 18 shots. D'Angelo says that means at least one other officer believed there was still a threat.
12:16 p.m. D'Angelo also says that while BCI investigators matched shell casings to the guns that fired them, they were unable to determine the sequence in which the shots were fired.
12:11 p.m. D'Angelo says the fact Russell did not try to drive between two police cars that were blocking his path in the middle school parking lot is significant.
He says the court could infer that Russell had already suffered a fatal gunshot wound at that time, before Brelo climbed onto the hood of the car.
11:59 a.m. D'Angelo says that in radio recordings, officers relay their belief that someone in the car had a gun.
He also says that although investigators never found a gun, Russell and Williams might have disposed of one during the chase.
11:56 a.m. "[The officers] did not respond because of the color of the occupants of that vehicle," D'Angelo says. "They were trying to serve and protect. They were trying to do the right thing."
11:54 a.m. D'Angelo says it's unclear whether the threat was over when other officers stopped shooting.
He also says the fact Williams and Russell were black had "nothing to do" with the officers' actions during the chase and shooting.
11:42 a.m. D'Angelo, who previously represented the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, said he believes the officers involved in the shooting were trying to do their duty.
"They are simple, ordinary people who try to do the best they can, and they're put in some very dangerous situations," he says.
11:35 a.m. D'Angelo says Judge O'Donnell must consider whether Brelo's use of force was justified in the moment, instead of considering it with the benefit of hindsight.
11:31 a.m. The trial resumes. Defense attorney Patrick D'Angelo is giving his opening statement.
11:15 a.m. Bell ends his opening statement by saying the case is a historic and pivotal case.
Judge O'Donnell announces another 15-minute break before the defense has a chance to offer its opening statement. The trial will resume about 11:30 a.m.
11:12 a.m. "The evidence will show that there are good police officers who lost their way that night during the pursuit," Bell says.
11:03 a.m. Bell says an audio expert determined that after an initial barrage of shots, officers stopped shooting for 1.6 seconds before one more shot was fired. The shooting stopped for another 2.6 seconds, after which 18 more shots were fired. Evidence will show Brelo fired 15 of the final 18 shots from the Chevrolet's hood, Bell said.
10:57 a.m. The evidence will show that both Williams and Russell were alive when Brelo was standing on the hood, Bell says. Williams was shot from above 11 times and Russell was shot from above six times, he says.
10:49 a.m. Bell says testimony from medical experts will show Williams was alive when Brelo was standing on the Chevrolet's hood and firing shots into the car. He says the evidence will show that the shots from above killed Williams.
Williams had her hands up when Brelo was standing on the hood, Bell says.
10:43 a.m. Bell shows photographs of the clothes Russell and Williams were wearing. He also shows a photo of a mannequin depicting Williams' body, with markings showing where she was shot.
10:38 a.m. The prosecution will argue that Brelo gave false statements to investigators, Bell says.
For example, Brelo told investigators he fired five or six shots, thought his gun jammed, then reloaded his gun in his police car. Those statements proved to be untrue, Bell says.
"The numbers don't add up. He's not telling the truth," Bell says.
10:29 a.m. The trial resumes with more of Bell's opening statement.
10:13 a.m. Judge O'Donnell calls for a short break. The trial is expected to resume about 10:30 a.m.
10:11 a.m. Brelo told investigators that he could not remember jumping on the Chevrolet's hood, Bell says.
However, Bell says Cleveland Police Lt. Mark Ketterer will testify that he spoke with Brelo on the phone the day after the shooting. Ketterer will testify that Brelo talked about standing on the hood and shooting down at the car, and that Brelo described it as "like being back in Iraq," Bell says.
10:05 a.m. Bell says Brelo should have stopped shooting because police cars had surrounded the Chevrolet and other officers had stopped shooting.
"Here the chase had stopped. The shooting had stopped. The threat was over," Bell says.
10:00 a.m. Bell says an expert on police use of force will give testimony saying Brelo acted unreasonably when he jumped onto the Chevrolet's hood.
9:53 a.m. Bell says Brelo lost control when he jumped on the Chevrolet's hood during the shooting. Bell says the shots fired from atop the Chevrolet's hood were "the point where [Brelo's] actions became criminal."
9:47 a.m. Prosecutor Rick Bell begins his opening statement by calling Nov. 29, 2012 a tragic day for Williams and Russell and a "disgraceful" day for Cleveland police.
9:41 a.m. Barnhill provides a breakdown of the 137 shots fired at the Chevrolet. Brelo fired at least 49 shots, she says.
9:37 a.m. Barnhill also references an illustration showing the Chevrolet Malibu, two police cars, and the locations where the bullets hit the Chevrolet.
9:34 a.m. Barnhill is using a model of the shooting scene to illustrate the end of the chase. It includes small models of Cleveland police cars and the Chevrolet Malibu.
9:30 a.m. More than 60 police cars were involved in the 22-mile chase, which began in downtown Cleveland and ended in the Heritage Middle School parking lot in East Cleveland. The Chevrolet Malibu that Russell was driving reached speeds of 110 mph during the approximately 25-minute chase.
9:24 a.m. A detailed account of the police chase can be found here.
9:19 a.m. Prosecutor Erica Barnhill will speak next about the police chase, Royster says.
9:17 a.m. Royster speaks about Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, who died following the police chase and shooting. Royster describes Russell's struggles with substance abuse and his relationship with his son. She also describes Williams' health issues, including schizophrenia.
"They both were loved, and they both have family and friends in this courtroom today," she says.
9:10 a.m. Prosecutor Sherrie Royster says witnesses to the chase and shooting, police officers, medical experts, automobile engineers, experts in police tactics, experts in ballistics and others will testify in the coming weeks.
"They will tell you how the defendant, Michael Brelo, crossed the line from someone who enforces the law to someone who broke it that night," Royster says.
9:04 a.m. The trial begins with opening statements. Prosecutors Rick Bell, Sherrie Royster and Erica Barnhill will give opening statements today, according to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.
9:00 a.m. Michael Brelo, his attorneys and prosecutors are gathered in the courtroom awaiting the start of the trial, which is expected to begin shortly.
Brelo was indicted on two counts of voluntary manslaughter on May 30, 2014. He pleaded not guilty to both counts.
Thirteen police officers shot 137 bullets following the car chase, hitting Russell 23 times and Williams 24 times. Prosecutors have argued that only Brelo continued to shoot after other officers perceived any threat was over.
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge John P. O'Donnell has forbidden live streaming from the courtroom, but we'll have a live blog throughout the trial.

Typing “reusable rockets” into a search engine, you can't help but be drawn to the allure of SpaceX-related links which fill the screen. In fact, the corporate brainchild of Elon Musk dominates the first few pages of results near-exclusively. The reason for this is understandable: with the death of the Space Shuttle and lack of clear planning for the future by most old players in the spaceflight field, SpaceX's straightforward, near term plan and previous flight tests make them everyone's favorite to drastically reduce cost to orbit with rockets which return home – ready to be reused.
And with the upcoming launch of SpaceX's 14th Falcon 9 rocket on January 6 carrying Dragon to the ISS, the potential for true rocket reusability is certainly within reach for the first time ever in the near 90 years since Goddard launched the world's first liquid fueled rocket from Massachusetts in 1926. Yet, now is a more important time than ever to temper our wild expectations for the possibility of rockets which fly themselves back to the launch pad. While a rocketry revolution may be among us, it is an iterative, multi-step process that transcends any single mission — and we shouldn't expect to see regular airline-like reuse and large cost drops anytime soon.
It should be noted that Elon Musk, for all his amazing accomplishments, has never placed a hard and fast timeline on when cheap and accessible rocketry would be available, let alone a solid price. Why? Simply because we are entering territory that remains uncharted.
The only launch vehicle in history that has ever been re-flown several times after achieving orbit was the Space Shuttle. Despite reusing by far the most expensive part of any rocket — the engines and associated systems — the Shuttle cost at least $450 million to launch according to NASA, with a relatively small payload of 24 metric tons to Low Earth Orbit, or almost $19,000 per kilogram. Including development costs, summed and divided up per flight, the price to launch can average as high as $1.5 billion, or thrice NASA's stated amount. What was supposed to drastically reduce the cost per kilogram of lifting cargo to orbit ended up being one of the most expensive launch vehicles in human history. Why did it become so expensive?
The conception of the Space Shuttle was a result of a marriage between NASA, the Air Force, and other partners. Each wanted their own design specifications, which ended up producing a wieldy vehicle with no well-defined purpose, and it became the “catch all” of the space industry. Mainly, it was that the amount of maintenance required after every mission was greatly underestimated by NASA. After each flight, the entire vehicle had to be essentially rebuilt: tiles replaced, engines inspected, boosters refurbished. In particular, the trio of RS-25 main engines had to be taken apart and checked for every possible defect that could cause a failure, and when things broke, there wasn't a healthy supply-line that could replace them easily, causing the cost of spare parts to skyrocket, and maintaining a workforce ready and able to refurbish the Shuttle quickly became a money-sink that NASA was never able to recover.
SpaceX isn't NASA though. They've introduced a more agile, responsive development approach to their products which has been overwhelmingly successful. They also have years of prior projects (from multiple sources) to learn from that NASA didn't. However, these aren't problems that can be simply waved away. Rather, they are fundamental issues that need addressing: there is no escaping the confines of physics.
A common theme of Musk's statements is the audacious aspiration to revolutionize the “one use and throw it away” model that has dominated the rocket industry since the beginning, morphing it into something more closely related to a service-based airline model. This is a big task, even by Iron Man's standards.
Many fans show an under appreciation of the barriers to entry. In fact, in a recent survey conducted on the SpaceX fan community at Reddit.com, when asked to place an educated guess on the price of a Falcon 9 rocket launch in 5 years time, a significant portion of the nearly 600 respondents selected a value beneath $20,000,000. Some even selected prices below $10,000,000. Although COO of SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell has mentioned in passing that reusable Falcon 9 launches could eventually command a $5-7 million price tag, this is likely far in the future, far past merely the dawn of reusable rockets. For some perspective, five years ago in 2010, SpaceX launched two Falcon 9 rockets. Last year, they launched six, and suddenly, by 2020, the cost of a standard Falcon 9 launch will be three times as cheap? Where has this extra acceleration in development come from? Possibly it comes from the minds of some slightly too-optimistic fans.
In fact, something even as basic as long-term engine maintenance is still relatively unknown. Previously, SpaceX has clarified that each engine has a life of approximately 40 firings, and a casual observer would assume this results in an engine that can be used on 40 missions. However, with three engine test fires prior to each launch, the launch itself, and the three burns required to complete the reentry and re-landing process, the center engine is in fact required to fire 7 times to complete a mission, and with nine engines on every lower stage – even with most only firing a few times, that results in quite a number of parts that can break down after every flight. Checking for these failures and repairing them could become a lot more costly and time consuming than one might hope.
For example, with a diameter of 3.66m, and a height of approximately 42 meters, there is nearly 500 square meters of first stage surface that has been exposed on one side to the frigid temperatures of liquid oxygen and chilled kerosene, and on the other, various temperatures from reentry into the soupy lower atmosphere. In fact, even the ice buildup on the outer skin of the vehicle alone is significant enough to substantially alter the vehicle's mass! Within that large area, tensile, thermodynamic, and pressure-related fatigue has the potential to accumulate. Striations could nucleate and form hairline cracks. This is a hazard that could lead to a critical failure on an operational mission, and such an event could permanently ingrain an association between the nascent reusable rocket and instability in the minds of satellite operators and the insurance industry. And although Falcon 9 could be considered over-engineered, it is unlikely SpaceX will play rocket roulette.
Although the rocket's chief engineer estimated a coin toss's probability of success, upon the hopeful propulsive landing of CRS-5 on the recently christened “autonomous drone landing ship,” the empty first stage will likely be shipped back to SpaceX's Hawthorne, California headquarters and inspected with various methods of destructive and non-destructive analysis to quantify how the rigors of accelerating to a velocity of nearly 2 kilometers per second in less than three minutes and then decelerating enough, reentering through the atmosphere, to land in close proximity to sea and salt, affect the vehicle.
Another example of a potential refurbishment cost lies in SpaceX's fuel of choice, kerosene. It burns relatively dirty, as evidenced by the translucent pillar of brown-black soot that Falcon 9 ascends on, a throwback to the days of early aircraft. This leads to an effect predominantly associated with kerolox engines known as “coking” – where incompletely combusted soot adheres to the near-molten engine and nozzle, reducing its ability to radiate away heat. Clean it off, you say? Congratulations, you've just introduced refurbishment into the equation, something that SpaceX is striving to avoid.
Even ignoring the vehicle itself, launches and the chemicals needed are expensive! There's the exorbitantly-priced helium which is required to keep the tanks pressurized, and the pyrophoric TEA-TEB ignition fluid used to begin the explosive marriage between the RP-1 & LOX. It's not just chemicals either. There's ground launch operation costs too, ranging from employee wages, to the dull process of permit applications, to the slightly more interesting ablative paint that coats the Transporter-Erector structure which holds Falcon 9 vertical, to transportation and relocation costs. In all likelihood, the current capital expenses of a single launch alone, ignoring the obvious value of the rocket itself, total in the region of $3 million plus.
Fundamentally, we must decouple re-landing, refurbishment, reusability, and financially viable and rapid reuse from each other. It can be a difficult concept to grasp that all four are distinct, and the success of one does not imply the next step is guaranteed. Because of this, question marks still remain over the cost, time, and complexity of the final steps necessary for SpaceX to complete its reusable rocket master plan. For example: re-landing a rocket does not necessarily make refurbishment nonexistent. This is the take home story of the Space Shuttle.
A landing alone doesn't revolutionize rocketry; rather, we may only realize the revolution of refining rocketry into an airline-like model has occurred well only by looking back in the rear view mirror.
We live in hope that SpaceX achieves what it originally set out to do nearly 13 years ago. SpaceX has come far, far closer than anyone else to this goal, but as Musk himself has said, “Rockets are hard”. Good luck to the team at SpaceX for their upcoming CRS-5 launch and landing attempt, it's the beginning of something far bigger.

What distinguishes this moment from the others in which UVA was thrust into the national spotlight is that it asks the community to reflect on itself and its relationship with outside forces. The white supremacists “threw down the challenge to say, ‘This place belongs to us,'” said Woolfork, the English professor. “Now, students are coming back and saying, ‘No, this is mine.'”
For Wes Gobar, a senior double-majoring in history and government who serves as the president of UVA's Black Student Alliance, the violent clashes in Charlottesville demonstrate the urgent need for telling the honest history of the school—a history that includes students and faculty who have thrived in spite of institutional inertia around matters of race.
Gobar noted that he finds benefits in Jefferson's intellectual contributions, but argued that they must be unpacked and contextualized. “If you were to consult Thomas Jefferson on the topic of the alt-right, what would his answer be?" Given that Jefferson's writings describe blacks as “inferior to whites in the endowments of body and mind,” Gobar said, the answer would be “unsettling.”
Kenny, the student council president who in her campaign pledged to challenge "good ol' boy" perceptions of student government, spoke of a need to reinterpret Jeffersonian ideals in the context of equity and inclusion. Rather than letting Jefferson's narrow vision of citizen leadership—restricted to white, landowning men—constrain the college, she said, the school community ought to apply that legacy in a way that promotes an inclusive campus.
Wellmon, the Germanic studies professor, suggested that what's at stake isn't located in the school's founder, but rather in its role as an institution of higher learning. The intolerance and baseless rhetoric that white supremacists espouse, he said, assaults the intellectual inquiry at the heart of the modern university. “What happened last Friday,” he said, “was a trespass against the practices and values of universities across history and across the world.” As he teaches his first class on Wednesday, he'll propose reading texts carefully and basing arguments in evidence as a means of resistance against claims of white supremacy.
UVA maintains a strong tradition of student self-governance, which grants students an unusual degree of responsibility for tasks typically reserved for administrators, like upholding the school's storied Honor Code and adjudicating disciplinary cases. In this structure, whatever changes students want to see in their new school year have to come from them.
Kenny finds the tradition of student governance empowering, especially at a time when the university community is divided on the administration's response to last week's violence. For students like Evelyn Wang, a current UVA senior studying commerce and women, gender, and sexuality studies, however, the opportunity to assert big changes can feel more like a burden, especially as students balance a demanding new year with raw emotions. “There are a lot of students feeling fatigue here regarding the expectations on us to be doing something about the violence, the onus always being on us to be fighting for it,” she said. Then, there's the complicating factor of student turnover, which Wang said weakens momentum for student-driven initiatives. “A lot of us are fourth-years, and we're going to be gone after this year,” Wang said. “That kind of institutional memory is so hard to retain year after year with students.”

WASHINGTON — Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke says he would never sell, give away or transfer public lands, a crucial stance in his home state of Montana and the West where access to hunting and fishing is considered sacrosanct.
Zinke feels so strongly that he resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer because of the GOP's position in favor of land transfers to state or private groups. But Zinke's commitment to public lands has come into question in recent weeks and is likely to be a point of contention Tuesday as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee considers his nomination to be interior secretary under President-elect Donald Trump.
Zinke, 55, a former Navy SEAL who just won his second term in Congress, was an early Trump supporter and, like his prospective boss, has expressed skepticism about the urgency of climate change.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
A self-described “Teddy Roosevelt Republican,” Zinke has supported legislation to boost land and water conservation and recreation on public lands. Zinke has also advocated for increased oil and gas drilling and coal-mining on Western lands.
The Interior Department and other U.S. agencies control almost a third of land in the West and even more of the underground “mineral estate” that holds vast amounts of coal, oil and natural gas.
Zinke's position on public lands came under fire after he voted in favor of a measure from House Republicans that would allow federal land transfers to be considered cost-free and budget-neutral, making it easier for drilling and development.
Zinke “says he's against transfer of federal lands, but there's a big gap between what he says and what he does in that regard,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest and largest environmental group.
“You'd think the congressman would be on his best behavior going into a job interview, but instead he's taking steps to once again jeopardize the future of Montana's outdoor economy,” Nancy Keenan, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, said after the Jan. 3 vote.
Zinke's spokeswoman said the congressman maintains his position against the sale or transfer of federal lands.
Supporter calls the dispute overblown and say Zinke's vote was on a much larger package that sets House rules in the new Congress.
Indeed, his support for public lands was a crucial reason why Zinke was chosen by Trump. The president-elect and his son, Donald Trump Jr., both oppose sale of federal lands. The younger Trump, an avid hunter, has taken a keen interest in Interior issues and played a key role in Zinke's selection.
Coal is likely to be another focus on Tuesday. Montana boasts the largest coal reserves in the nation, and Zinke has warned environmentalists and the Obama administration that to take coal out of the energy mix would be “a disaster.”
“I don't agree with keeping it in the ground,” he said during his re-election campaign.
Eric Washburn, a lobbyist and former aide to Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said Zinke will likely be asked to “defend federal ownership over federal lands” and detail how he would balance energy development with the need to conserve fish and wildlife habitats.
Zinke “appears to be a straight shooter, someone that energy and conservation interests can both work with,” Washburn said.

The Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership endorsed Zinke, calling him “a leader on many issues important to America's hunters and anglers.”
Brune, of the Sierra Club, scoffed at the comparison to Roosevelt, saying the only way to connect the men is “to describe the ways Zinke wants to undo TR's legacy” of conservation.
Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the energy panel, said she is eager to ask Zinke about modernizing the federal coal program “to make sure American taxpayers aren't short-changed for the benefit of corporate interests.” Cantwell also said wants reassurances that Zinke will protect the interests of American consumers and native tribes — “not just the coal and mining companies.”
Zinke spent 23 years as a Navy SEAL, serving in Kosovo and Iraq, where he was awarded two Bronze Stars for combat missions. He currently serves on the House Natural Resources and Armed Services committees.
He made an unsuccessful 2012 run for Montana lieutenant governor before shifting his ambitions to Congress in 2014. Before his selection for Interior, Zinke had been considered a likely challenger to Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018.
Despite global efforts to curb copyright infringement, the temptation to use BitTorrent sites to download free movies and TV shows is too strong for employees in the EU Parliament, the Vatican, the US House of Representatives, and some Hollywood studios.
The new information was revealed by TorrentFreak, which used a tracking outfit called ScanEye to identify those illegally downloading files in some rather surprising places.
The website reported that EU Parliament employees have shown keen interest in downloading pirated movies and TV shows while at work. Dozens of recent “hits” entered from EU Parliament IP addresses on several BitTorrent trackers revealed that employees have downloaded pirated versions of new movies such as ‘Elysium' and ‘Monsters vs. Aliens.' They also appear to be fans of classic flicks such as ‘The Ten Commandments,' as well as popular television shows such as ‘Breaking Bad.'
The same illegal activity also made its way into the Vatican, with movies such as ‘Billy Elliot' being downloaded along with TV series such as ‘Camp.'
Even some Hollywood studios - including Paramount Pictures - made it on the list, with employees illegally downloading ‘Shame' and ‘Mad Men.'
BitTorrent downloads also took place from inside the US House of Representatives. Television drama ‘Sons of Anarchy' was downloaded from the premises, although TorrentFreak did note that fewer hits came from the House in 2013 than in previous years.
This comes even despite US lawmakers' efforts to crack down on copyright infringement by introducing the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in October 2011. The act proposed to broaden the government's right to fight online copyright infringement and the trading of counterfeit goods.
The proposal included the introduction of court orders to ban advertising networks and payment facilities from doing business with infringing websites. It also aimed to prohibit search engines from linking to such websites, and requested that ISPs block access to the websites.
Many internet users and organizations heavily criticized the proposal. On January 18, 2012, more than 7,000 websites - including Wikipedia, Reddit, and Google - took part in an internet blackout to protest against SOPA. The act was shelved indefinitely just days after the action. The House Judiciary Committee eventually postponed consideration of the legislation.
The fight against illegal downloads continues across the globe. The world's biggest torrent site, The Pirate Bay, has repeatedly been forced to change its domain due to multiple terminations of its former web addresses.
In November, the Supreme Court of Belgium ordered ISPs throughout the nation to begin proactive efforts to search and censor proxy services for The Pirate Bay.
Earlier this month – just one day after The Pirate Bay moved its domain to Guyana – the website was informed that it was being “immediately suspended.” The site then chose to move to Sweden's .SE domain, which it initially left in the first place, following legal threats.

When I was an awkward teenager who did not fit in with the other kids, the logical Mr. Spock was a character I could really identify with. At this time, I did not know why I related to Spock because when I was a teenager, I did not know that my thinking process was different from that of most other people. I assumed that my logical picture-based thinking was the way that everybody thought.
Today I know that most people think in words – not in pictures as I do – and their actions are highly motivated by emotions. Mr. Spock always controlled his emotions and used logic. In my book, Thinking in Pictures, I discussed a "Star Trek" episode) that clearly showed the conflict that can occur between emotions and logic. When the shuttlecraft was being attacked by an alien, Spock wanted to immediately take off to avoid the risk of being killed. The others wanted to wait and recover the body of a fallen comrade. This emotional response could have endangered the lives of everybody. As I wrote,
“It may sound simplistic, but this episode helped me finally understand how I was different. I agree with Spock, but I learned that emotions will often overpower logical thinking, even if those decisions prove hazardous.”
My favorite Star Trek movie was “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,” the one about the whales, which was directed by Nimoy. It was a riot to see the Enterprise crew in a regular city in the present.
Leonard Nimoy had a period in his career where he wrote a book titled, I am Not Spock. When Mr. Nimoy was doing stage acting, I saw him in a play titled "The Man in a Glass Booth" where he portrayed a war criminal. When I saw him in a criminal role, it was really upsetting. All logic was gone. This was not the Spock I knew.
It is my understanding that Nimoy eventually accepted himself as Mr. Spock. This was evident in a silly advertisement he did for a hotel website, Priceline. When William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk on the original series, opened a hotel room door, Spock (Nimoy) was there.
Another thing I loved about "Star Trek" is that the original classic show had a good ethical principle in almost every episode. It really made me think about what was right and wrong.
But it was Spock's character that I really identified with. Many autistic people have identified with Spock; friends and families of autistic people also have gained greater understanding of their friend and relative by comparison to Spock.
To me, Nimoy will always be Mr. Spock.
Editor's Note: Temple Grandin, Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University and an advocate for people with autism, wrote eloquently about her identification with Spock, the half-Vulcan character in TV's Star Trek, in her 1996 autobiography Thinking In Pictures. TCUS asked her to comment on the passing of Leonard Nimoy who played Spock. By Temple Grandin, Colorado State University. This article was originally published on The Conversation.

The hacking group that recently leaked Colin Powell's emails is claiming to have executed another major breach -- posting the alleged passport of first lady Michelle Obama and a trove of messages from the purported email account of a White House aide.
The leaked files have not been verified, though top Obama administration officials said Thursday they are aware of the claims and are looking into the matter.
While the documents posted Thursday do not appear to contain the kind of salacious details leaked from former Secretary of State Powell's account, the emails deal with scheduling issues and other logistical minutiae -- the leak of which presents potential security issues.
A representative for the hackers' website, DC Leaks, said in an email to FoxNews.com that the hack exposed critical gaps in the Obama administration's efforts to keep its private correspondences protected.
“The leaked files show the security level of our government,” the representative said. “If terrorists hack emails of White House Office staff and get such sensitive information we will see the fall of our country.”
Gizmodo questioned the Obama passport in particular, though, citing inconsistencies in the document's fonts and picture.
The emails were allegedly sent and received by Ian Mellul, a White House aide who also serves on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
Politico reported that Mellul had been an advance associate with the White House since 2015 and was an event organizer for Clinton, sourcing the details to Mellul's LinkedIn page. That page had been deleted by Thursday afternoon.
Asked Thursday by Fox News if the Justice Department is aware of the apparent hack, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the department is looking into it.
The White House also acknowledged they were aware of the claims, though Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he could not speak to the authenticity of the documents.
He said the incident is a “reminder to practice good cyber hygiene.”
Earnest said the individual in question was not a White House staffer. Earnest suggested he was part of a team of short-term contractors that do logistics for official travel.

Iraq's leader, Nouri al-Maliki, has welcomed Syrian jets bombing near a border post lost by his forces to insurgents, in a rare strike against the jihadist group Isis that also occupies much of northern Syria.
Maliki acknowledged that a series of attacks on Tuesday targeting the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) near the town of al-Qaim, on the Iraqi-Syrian border, were carried out by the Syrian air force.
Joshua Earnest, White House spokesman, said earlier that the US had "no reason to dispute" reports that Syria had attacked within Iraqi territory but Maliki told the BBC that the air force had stuck to its side of the border. Maliki said the Syrian air strike on the Sunni militants left both countries "winners" but claimed his administration had no prior warning of the raids.
"There was no coordination involved, but we welcome this action. We welcome any Syrian strike against Isis because this group targets both Iraq and Syria ... But we didn't make any request from Syria. They carry out their strikes and we carry out ours. The final winners are our two countries," he said in an interview with BBC Arabic.
An initial translation supplied by the BBC said Maliki had confirmed Syrian air strikes in Iraq but this was later corrected to Syria.
The embattled Iraqi prime minister has asked for urgent help with air strikes to halt the advance by Isis, which has seized a 500-mile (800km) stretch of the border, two cities and almost one third of Iraq in a stunning sweep through northern and western areas in the past two weeks.
The US air support he urgently requested has been slow in coming though, with Washington reluctant to send its air force back into combat in Iraq in the absence of political unity among its leaders.
Maliki has also turned to Iran, which quickly sent a small force of troops to Iraq in the early days of the insurrection and has since sent arms and ammunition and senior officers to help defend Baghdad.
Tehran has played a similar role for the past three years in propping up the regime of Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad. It has significant leverage with Syria as a result, and analysts in Baghdad believe that the Syrian raids would not have gone ahead unless they had been coordinated with Iran and Iraq.
Iran has a vital interest in ensuring that both Damascus and Baghdad remain within its orbit and has framed Syria's civil war and the grave threat to Iraq as the same conflict. Maliki has held the same view throughout the Syrian war and, despite his previous dislike for Assad, has allowed Iraqi airspace to be used by Iranian military transport aircraft, whichregularly fly arms to Damascus.
Elsewhere in the country, Iraqi forces launched an airborne raid into Tikrit on Thursday, with helicopters disgorging soldiers into the city's sports stadium, from where they are expected to launch counterattacks against Isis forces, which who continue to occupy the city.
Much of the country's military has fled its posts in the north and Iraqi troops have so far been unable, or unwilling, to take on Isis in its newly won strongholds.
Isis has consolidated its hold on the central province of Diyala, forcing Kurdish peshmerga troops out of towns in the north of the province and continuing to attack Iraqi forces and Shia irregulars massed to the south.
A series of explosions and mortar attacks in the restive area of Mahmudiya and Latifiya, south of the capital, have raised fears that the jihadists are trying to open another front. Remnants of Maliki's forces and Shia militias have drawn battle lines in Baquba to the north and Taji to the north-west of the city.
Meanwhile, Masoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan regional government, arrived in Kirkuk on Thursday for the first time since peshmerga forces took control of the city from fleeing Iraqi forces.
The highly symbolic visit is seen in Baghdad as the Kurds laying claim to Kirkuk, a city they have historically coveted. Peshmerga forces were seen shoring up the city's defences.
The capitulation of Iraqis forces has changed the balance of power between Baghdad and the Kurdish north, but the significance of the shift remains overshadowed by the seemingly unstoppable momentum of the Isis advances.
The British foreign secretary, William Hague, arrived in Baghdad on Thursday to urge Maliki to form an inclusive administration to deal with the crisis, which he described as an "existential threat".
"The single most important factor that will determine whether or not Iraq overcomes this challenge is political unity," Hague said, echoing the sentiments of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, who made the same call earlier in the week.
Maliki appears to have ignored both men, insisting that he will not form a government of national salvation with rival sects and leaders, because it would be "unconstitutional".
He remains under intense pressure to form a government by the time parliament is convened on 4 July, but seems unable to muster the support he needs to do so.
"Seeing something invisible with your own eyes is an exciting experience," say Joachim Fischer and Tolga Ergin. For about one year, both physicists and members of the team of Professor Martin Wegener at KIT's Center for Functional Nanostructures (CFN) have worked on refining the structure of the Karlsruhe invisibility cloak to such an extent that it is also effective in the visible spectral range.
In invisibility cloaks, light waves are guided by the material such that they leave the invisibility cloak again as if they had never been in contact with the object to be disguised. Consequently, the object is invisible to the observer. The exotic optical properties of the camouflaging material are calculated using complex mathematical tools.
These properties result from a special structuring of the material. It has to be smaller than the wavelength of the light that is to be deflected. For example, the relatively large radio or radar waves require a material "that can be produced using nail scissors," says Wegener. At wavelengths visible to the human eye, materials have to be structured in the nanometer range.
The minute invisibility cloak produced by Fischer and Ergin is smaller than the diameter of a human hair. It makes the curvature of a metal mirror appear flat, as a result of which an object hidden underneath becomes invisible. The metamaterial placed on top of this curvature looks like a stack of wood, but consists of plastic and air. These "logs" have precisely defined thicknesses in the range of 100 nm. Light waves that are normally deflected by the curvature are influenced and guided by these logs such that the reflected light corresponds to that of a flat mirror.
"If we would succeed again in halving the log distance of the invisibility cloak, we would obtain cloaking for the complete visible light spectrum," says Fischer.
Last year, the Wegener team presented the first 3-D invisibility cloak in the journal Science. Until that time, the only invisibility cloaks existed in waveguides and were of practically two-dimensional character. When looking onto the structure from the third dimension, however, the effect disappeared. By means of an accordingly filigree structuring, the Karlsruhe invisibility cloak could be produced for wavelengths from 1500 to 2600 nm. This wavelength range is not visible to the human eye, but plays an important role in telecommunications. The breakthrough was based on the use of the direct laser writing method (DLS) developed by CFN. With the help of this method, it is possible to produce minute 3-D structures with optical properties that do not exist in nature, so-called metamaterials.
In the past year, the KIT scientists continued to improve the already extremely fine direct laser writing method. For this purpose, they used methods that have significantly increased the resolution in microscopy. With this tool, they then succeeded in refining the metamaterial by a factor of two and in producing the first 3-D invisibility cloak for non-polarized visible light in the range of 700 nm. This corresponds to the red color.
"The invisibility cloak now developed is an attractive object demonstrating the fantastic possibilities of the rather new field of transformation optics and metamaterials. The design options that opened up during the last years had not been deemed possible before," emphasizes Ergin. "We expect dramatic improvements of light-based technologies, such as lenses, solar cells, microscopes, objectives, chip production, and data communication."
It's been a stormy few years for the Willmar City Council, the West Central Tribune's editorial board noted in a May editorial, Willmar City Council members are losing our trust.
And the council members are sensitive to public opinion, we learned in Willmar Labor Relations Committee discusses limits to open forums, a news report later in the month.
But tonight, the Willmar City Council had its own moment of zen on Twitter when West Central Tribune education beat reporter Linda Vanderwerf tweeted about their fear of a tweeted planet:
#WillmarCouncil discussing whether to allow any phones in the chambers. Don't like what they say going out on #Twitter right away. — Linda Vanderwerf (@lindavanderwerf) June 15, 2015
Members say is annoying and intimidating. #WillmarCouncil That danged First Amendment. — Linda Vanderwerf (@lindavanderwerf) June 15, 2015
That was followed by:
#WillmarCouncil is attending training with League of Minnesota Cities. Interesting refresher on Open Meeting Law. — Linda Vanderwerf (@lindavanderwerf) June 15, 2015
Finally:
So the#WillmarCouncil talked about banning phones from chambers, because #Twitter. Me? I picked up my phone and tweeted it. #firstamendment — Linda Vanderwerf (@lindavanderwerf) June 15, 2015
Fortunately, there's some good news to share from the council meeting:
#Willmar made it to second round in Bark for your Park contest for funding for a #dogpark. Good news for our pooches. :) #WillmarCouncil — Linda Vanderwerf (@lindavanderwerf) June 16, 2015
And that's the way it is--in West Central Minnesota.

Media expert David Brock, once an enemy of the Clintons, is now using his experience to help their party
It's a case of poacher turned game-keeper. US Democrats, reeling from losses in the midterm elections, are turning to a former Republican media hitman to boost their chances of taking the White House in 2016.
David Brock is the name; his trademark, a silver pompadour and Trotsky-style wire-rimmed glasses; his political ethos, to beat Republicans by using an apparatus of quick-response law, ethics groups and journalism groups, a strategy pioneered, naturally, by the Republicans.
“I know from experience that, over a 30-year arc, rightwing conservatives came to dominate American political discourse in the media, and it needs to be countered,” Brock told the Observer last week. “And I know how something like it would work on the progressive side.”
In the culture wars of the mid-90s, Brock, 52, was a far-right hero. He wrote a book casting doubt on the credibility of Anita Hill, the aide who accused supreme court justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Then, as part of the conservative-funded Arkansas Project, Brock broke the story of “Troopergate” and identified a woman named Paula, aka Paula Jones, one of a string of Bill Clinton “bimbo eruptions” that would culminate in the Monica Lewinsky-inspired impeachment hearings.
Once so committed that his answering machine message said: “Hello, I'm out trying to bring down the president,” Brock has turned on his deep-pocketed former sponsors with a vengeance. First came his sympathetic biography of Hillary Clinton in 1996, followed a year later by an Esquire magazine essay, Confessions of a Right-Wing Hitman, that announced his break with the right. Brock recalled last week how in the mid-90s he began to have “huge reservations about the character and integrity of the people in the conservative movement”.
Everyone loves a sinner redeemed, and Brock is no exception. What he offers is not an ideological or political solution but a willingness to counteract a Republican political machine calibrated to find and exploiting Democrat weaknesses.
In 2004, Brock founded Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog that helped to bring down Glenn Beck, a Fox News host given to hysterical outbursts, and later helped to publicise comments about “legitimate rape” made to a Missouri TV station by Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin.
He then established American Bridge, a political action committee that has raised $12m from donors including George Soros over the past two years. With more than 80 staff, a key part of its mission is to assign people called “trackers” to tail Republicans, looking for “gotcha” moments that could derail their political ambitions.
Other weapons in the Brock arsenal include the theoretically non-partisan corruption watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew); the American Democracy Legal Fund, charged with battling Republicans in the courts; and the American Independent Institute, which provides funds for journalists investigating rightwing activities.
Liberals, he says, have failed to understand that political campaigns are constant, not only fought during election years, and require long-term funding. “We've basically been trying to play catch-up. There was a tendency on the progressive side to dismiss rightwing media like Fox News as not credible and therefore not important, and they were very late in understanding the nature and power of the infrastructure the rightwing had built.”
While there is residual unease among some liberal operatives that Brock's conversion story fits into a pattern of opportunism and self-promotion rather than ideological transformation, Brock's war on the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, coupled with rigorous defence of Hillary Clinton, has earned him growing influence in progressive circles.
Brock acknowledges only that his mission is to counter rightwing attacks, though the focus of those attacks – and thus the rapid-response resources of American Bridge – are clearly centred on preventing opponents from defining Clinton during her candidacy-in-waiting. The left-leaning publication the Nation recently described Brock's political apparatus as designed “to put Hillary in the White House”.
That unnerves some party advisers who fear this kind of surveillance can only harm the political process. Candidates will be forced to the centre of political discourse. Surrendering principles for electoral success could turn out to be a hollow victory – or no victory at all, says a former Kennedy adviser, Andrew Karsch. “Democrats need a statesman who can articulate the issues, not someone who holds their finger to the wind on every issue. Instead of arguing something, you just mud-wrestle? That's not an answer. It's a complete capitulation.”
Despite Brock's expertise, Democrats may be unsuited to adopting the well-honed tactics of Republicans. This month Democrat billionaire Tom Steyer poured tens of millions into candidates promoting climate-change awareness – a counter to Tea Party funders the Koch brothers – and received no electoral return on his outlay.
Earlier this year, Brock was invited to Arkansas to deliver an address, Countering the Culture of Clinton Hating, to the Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock. He spoke of how conservatives “upended many of our long-held ways of conducting politics” and how, unless those dynamics are challenged, history could repeat itself.
Of course, it was pursuing that agenda that gave Brock his start. Several years later, Hillary Clinton distributed copies of Brock's 2002 book, Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative, as proof of the “vast rightwing conspiracy” that had existed against the couple.
In addition to his other groups, Brock serves as an adviser to the grassroots outreach programme Ready for Hillary, and is on the board of Priorities USA, a fundraising operation devoted to a Clinton candidacy. He says Media Matters is already responding to “a fair amount of Clinton-related material”, while American Bridge has a group, Correct the Record, that is solely focused on defending her record. “We're doing that because there are 10 Republican super PACs [political action committees] out there trying to tarnish her reputation in advance of her making a decision on whether she is going to run,” Brock says. “We already have our hands full in terms of media misinformation.”
He anticipates a silver lining to the Democrats' recent poor showing at the ballot box. When the newly-elected Republicans start showing their true political colours, his group will be there to document them, and perhaps to influence Republicans' choice of presidential candidate in 2016. Brock says American Bridge has identified 20 potential Republican candidates for president or vice-president, and put field trackers on them. “We're way ahead of the curve,” he enthuses. “Based on our research, we're going to be an important player in how the Republican presidential ticket is defined.”
Mumbai: Radhika Apte's lovemaking scene with Adil Hussain from her recent film ‘Parched' had leaked and gone viral even before the film's trailer was out. While the controversy subsided later, a question about the scene at an event got Radhika fuming. When a journalist asked her about the controversy that was created before the release of the film, and asked her whether it is necessary to become controversial to become successful, Radhika got extremely angry and gave him a piece of her mind.
She said, "Sorry, but your question is very ridiculous. Controversies are made by the people like you. You saw the clip, you shared with other people, you are the person... controversies are made out of.
"I am an artiste, if I am required to do a certain job then I will do it. If you get out of your cocoon and look at the world cinema and what people are doing abroad, what people are successfully doing, who are not ashamed of their bodies, you'll probably not ask me this question. People who are ashamed of their bodies, have curiosity about other people's bodies. So if you want to see a naked body tomorrow, look at yourself in the mirror or yourself rather than my clip."
When later the journalist apologized about ‘hurting' her, Radhika said, “I feel hurt? You need to get over yourself, you'll get over it.”

At least in politics, this is an era of awful arguments. Arguments made in bad faith. Arguments in which no one, on either side, is willing to change their mind. Arguments where the points being made do not describe, or influence, the positions being held. Arguments that leave everyone dumber, angrier, sadder. Which is why I wanted to talk to Julia Galef this week. Julia is the host of the Rationally Speaking podcast, a co-founder of the Center for Applied Rationality, and the creator of the Update Project, which maps out arguments to make it easier for people to disagree clearly and productively. Her work focuses on how we think and argue, as well as the cognitive biases and traps that keep us from hearing what we're really saying, hearing what others are really saying, and preferring answers that make us feel good to answers that are true. I first met her at a Vox Conversation conference, where she ran a session helping people learn to change their minds, and it's struck me since then that more of us could…
Villordsutch reviews Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection – Shamballa…
“In Mega-City One a brutal murder is discovered, seemingly of unnatural origin. Around the globe people fall prey to visions and religious mania. It seems that the world is on the brink of a psychic apocalypse and Psi-Judge Anderson must travel into the heart of Tibet to find the source of the disturbance…”
Here in this collection we have five tales about Judge Cassandra Anderson, who first appeared in January 1980 in a Judge Death story. I've always considered Judge Anderson to be the conscience of the Justice Dept. within Mega-City One, the conscience with a smart mouth and a handy set of fists on her if needs be. A good balance against Dredd who although she can truly wind him up, he also appreciates the fact that she is a good officer and that she is there.
We have here a collection of Anderson stories, all written by Alan Grant and the art handled by Arthur Ronson, and we watch her develop spiritually as we move from chapter to chapter, beginning with Shamballa – also the title of this collection. The entire world has fallen prey to religious hallucinations and Judge Anderson's investigations lead her to Tibet where she discovers the world's spiritual well-being is rotting. The story is an interesting opening for the Anderson newcomers and shows her character well, along with some of her skills in the field.
The following tale is The Jesus Syndrome, this is one of the stronger stories within this collection as the fear of the peace and hope from a newly formed Christian Group makes the Judges nervous, so they drag the leader in to be interrogated by a rather brutal Judge Goon and not so brutal Judge Anderson. After a clash between both Judges the dirty side of Justice is observed by Anderson, but all she can do is remember and turn away from it.
Protest starts of rather brilliantly with a lone member of the public setting himself aflame, with the statement of the witness to the suicide being given as we watch these scenes playout; the story continues to grow strong until the last match falls at the end. Though the end being, ‘Hope is the ability to keep a Goldfish without a licence' may appear to be minor and a bit of a damp squib, on a rethink of the world that these Perps inhabit anything so small is hope. Also Arthur Ronson's Psi-Dream image of Anderson floating above the city looks amazing.
R*Volution for me was the weakest of the bunch. Anderson is sent far out into our Solar System to interview Veran D'Arque, the richest man in the Galaxy, who has absorbed several minds into his own to make him smart and wealthy. However, one of these minds has written a letter to the Justice Dept. admitting that they have committed a murder in the past and Anderson has arrived to investigate. Though the premise is interesting the story ends up being a mess with a chase sequence with leaves you wondering what is going on.
The final chapter Satan is a supernatural tale of the Dark lord himself (possibly) paying a visit to Mega-City One and after a bit of reading and bravery from Anderson the fallen angel is toppled. It's here we also get some kind words from Dredd to Anderson about the work she has done for the City. Not the strongest story in the book but not the worst either, it was good to see the stretched hand of Judge Dredd and to hear his apology. The artwork – within this story – from Arthur Ronson is fantastic especially when Satan opens, “The Book of Man”.
Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection – Shamballa isn't the best in the collection that's been released so far, it's enjoyable but it's not great. If you want to know more on Anderson then this will give you that bit more information who she is, however you will possibly be able to pick up some of Anderson's abilities in the future tales of the Mega Collections.
Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection – Shamballa is available to buy now priced £9.99 or online here.

Over the last three months, several female journalists have reported being barred from the Speaker's Lobby at the House of Representatives for wearing sleeveless dresses or blouses, though no written rule exists prohibiting bare shoulders.
CBS reported on Thursday that a female reporter had recently been prevented from entering the Speaker's Lobby because her shoulders weren't covered. When she ripped out pages from her notebook to adhere to the dress code, a guard in the lobby still wouldn't let her enter. On Twitter, female reporters linking to the story have confirmed that they had recently been warned to cover their shoulders the next time they entered the chamber. In May, a congressional reporter for the Independent Journal Review, Haley Byrd, said that she was told to leave the Speaker's Lobby because she was wearing a sleeveless dress.

As CBS reported Thursday, there is no written dress code in place for reporters to follow. Chairman of the Standing Committee of Congressional Correspondents Billy House told CBS that these rules are an interpretation of a requirement for "proper decorum," a phrase often used in the rulebook disseminated at the start of each Congress. Jefferson's Manual and Rules of the House of Representatives notes that, during the 96th Congress, Speaker Tip O'Neill said that "proper" attire for men in the House included a suit jacket and tie, but did not specify what constituted "appropriate attire" for women.
Reporters appear to be getting shut out of the Lobby because they are beholden to the House's current interpretation of "appropriate attire." Speaker of the House Paul Ryan reminded House members that they should wear "appropriate business attire" in all sittings in the House in late June. Because dress code is enforced only in the Speaker's Lobby, which is adjacent to the House Chamber, the reporters lingering in the vicinity to ask passing representatives for an interview have been subject to the reinforced rule. Open-toed shoes and sneakers have also been nixed, and men are expected to wear suit jackets and ties.
"I suspect the rules are being emphasized now that it's summertime and excruciatingly hot outside and everyone is dressing for the weather," Byrd told CBS News.
The unwritten rule, however, is not being applied evenly to people entering and leaving the House chamber. Michelle Obama wore sleeveless dresses to multiple State of the Union addresses delivered by President Barack Obama; Ivanka Trump wore an off-the-shoulder dress to President Donald Trump's joint address of Congress in February.
"The committee expects enforcement to be geared and directed not just to reporters in the Speaker's Lobby—but lawmakers and congressional staffers as well," Billy House told CBS.
U.S. Special Forces Obscure in Iraq
U.S. Special Forces are the undetectable side of the war in Iraq, but is being used more and more in the fight against Sunni and Shiite militants. Iraqis complain some units often use excessive force, killing innocent people. Regular U.S. military units are often uncomfortable with their methods.
RENEE MONTAGNE, host:
U.S. Special Forces are an invisible side of the war in Iraq. And it - there are tools that is being used more and more in the fight against both Sunni and Shiite militants. Iraqis complain that some Special Forces units often use excessive force, killing innocent people during raids. Regular U.S. military units are often uncomfortable with their methods.
Concern for their safety or their jobs, none of the people cited in this report coming up from NPR's Anne Garrels would allow their names to be used. Here's that report.
ANNE GARRELS: On a recent embed, south of Baghdad, I happened on a group of Iraqi prisoners who had just been brought in by a joint U.S.-Iraqi Special Forces team. It was clear the prisoners had been badly beaten. They were covered in blood. The regular U.S. officers, with whom I was embedded, were disturbed by what they too, saw. This was by no means the first time they had witnessed the results of rough treatment by that Special Forces team. They expressed concern - such methods unnecessarily alienate Iraqis. The Special Forces, in turn, were angry I had seen what I had seen, and demanded I be removed from the base.
Typically, reporters are not permitted to interview Special Forces or embed with them. Consequently, their missions are not witnessed by journalists. Take the Sunni village of Mushada. It's just north of Baghdad. U.S. special operations units have conducted several raids there. One of those raids was on August 7th. U.S. and Iraqi accounts of the operation are distinctly different.
A person with knowledge of the mission says an informant called in the early hours to say two men the U.S. was looking for had arrived in Mushada. Two small Gazelle helicopters typically used by Special Forces immediately flew to the outskirts of the community, picking up the Iraqi informant along the way.
Villagers sleeping on their roofs saw the helicopters land in the predawn hours. They watched as a small group of armed men with dogs walked towards Ahmed Mahmoud Ali's(ph) house.
Iraqi witnesses say a U.S. Special Forces team interrogated Ahmed and then shot him. These same witnesses say American soldiers then shot Ahmed's wife possibly because she could identify the informant, a relative.
According to the person with knowledge of the mission, one American soldier was on the verge of tears after seeing what he described as unnecessary shootings. Iraqi witnesses say the Special Forces then raided other family houses in Mushada, killing two of Ahmed's brothers and detaining four relatives, some of whom were badly mauled by the American's attack dogs.
Asked about the raid, the U.S. military produced a brief press release. It says unspecified coalition forces responding to hostile intent killed three unnamed suspects.
By not identifying the dead or the village, it would have been impossible to follow up had witnesses not come forward. The U.S. release says the wife of one of the targets was killed when U.S. forces used explosives to breach a door. It says her husband had ordered her to stand behind the door to stop the coalition forces from entering.
There is only one thing the U.S. and Iraqi accounts agree on: that the main target of the raid, Ahmed Mahmoud Ali, was probably not a good guy. Both say he had hand grenades. Relatives say insurgent DVDs and a video camera, possibly used to document insurgent attacks, were also found in his possession.
However, villagers say the other victims were not likely to have been involved with al-Qaida. The villagers now see al-Qaida as a monster in their midst and support U.S. efforts to get rid of these fighters. But they have repeatedly complained to regular U.S. forces based in the area about the Special Operations. They say their intelligence is often faulty, provided by people who have a grudge, not proof.
When the U.S. military was asked to provide more information about the August 7th operation and access to those who took part in the raid, the request was denied. A U.S. military press officer responded to e-mail questions, saying, we are not talking about soldiers right out of boot camp. These troops involved are highly trained professionals. That was the end of the discussion.
Our request to speak to the head of Special Operations in Iraq was also denied.

* Sees support for enterprise apps this year
* Timing for business phones down to manufacturers
* Also plans new Android capabilities for consumers
NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) -Google Inc (GOOG.O) is planning to include support for business users in its Android platform as soon as this year pitting it against BlackBerry maker Research In Motion RIM.TO, Android developer Andy Rubin said on Friday.
Rubin, vice president of engineering at Google said that as well as adding new features for consumers, future versions of the Android operating system would support businesses who give phones to employees working on the road.
“Today we don't support many enterprise applications but in the future I think enterprise will be a good focus for us,” Rubin said in an interview with Reuters.
Rubin said Google would have support for enterprises “as soon as this year” but noted that the timing for Android phones that support businesses would depend on the speed at which manufacturers can add it to their products.
“The best I can do is release a platform with all the goodies inside in it and then the (manufacturers) do their job,” Rubin said.

BOSTON (CBS) — Two Massachusetts State Police detectives received a national award for identifying 2-year-old Bella Bond and the suspects accused of killing her.
Lieutenant Robert Murphy and Trooper Daniel Herman were honored at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's 2016 Heroes' Awards in Washington, DC, Thursday night.
A composite image of “Baby Doe” spread throughout social media for months as detectives worked to identify the little girl whose body washed ashore on Deer Island in June 2015.
In September 2015, a tipster helped crack the case. Bella's mother Rachelle Bond and Bond's boyfriend Michael McCarthy have been charged in connection with her death.
Revelations in the Panama Papers that key Clinton financial partners had numerous offshore entities is the latest investigation to expose the secretive Clinton Global Financial Network.
That network, which includes controversial financiers and foreign entities, has operated with the infusion of funds from offshore accounts and entities around the world. And there are more revelations to come.
As the Panama Papers reveal, major Clinton financial partners, including Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra and the Chagoury family of Nigeria, made use of the controversial Panamian law firm Mossack Fonseca to move assets around the world. Giustra is one of the largest contributors to the Clinton Foundation, donating more than $25 million. The Chagoury's of Nigeria have committed $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative
Several key figures in the uranium deal that sent 20 percent of American uranium production into the hands of the Russian government had offshore entities created by Mossack Fonseca. Frank Giustra used the firm to create UrAsia Energy, the company that acquired lucrative uranium concessions in Kazakhstan with the help of Bill Clinton back in 2005. UrAsia Energy eventually became Uranium One, which acquired uranium assets in the United States and then was sold to the Russian State Nuclear Agency (ROSATOM) in 2010.
Because of the obvious national security implications of turning over control of large quantities of uranium to the Russian government, the deal required approval from Hillary Clinton's State Department before it could go forward. Nine shareholders in Uranium One sent a combined $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Some of those contributions were not disclosed by the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One Chairman Ian Telfer sent the Clinton Foundation more than $2 million. Those contributions were revealed first in Clinton Cash and discovered using Canadian tax records.
Sergei Kurzin, a Russian mining investor who was also involved in the Uranium One deal, also used Mossack Fonseca. Kurzin's name appears on several oil companies set up by the firm. Kurzin says he donated $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.
Mossack Fonseca helped Nigeria's Ronald Chagoury set up a firm called Echo Art Ltd. which was domiciled in the British Virgin Islands.
This is not the first time that offshore accounts that figure into the Clinton's Global Financial Network have been exposed. Two years ago a Swiss whistleblower released the names of the super-rich who held Swiss accounts via the bank HSBC. As an earlier investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed, up to $81 million has flowed to the Clinton Foundation via Swiss accounts. As the investigation revealed, Swiss accounts were held by numerous Clinton donors.
Jeffrey Epstein, the controversial financier and convicted sex offender, held money in a HSBC Swiss account. He contributed $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
British retail magnate Richard Caring gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million from his HSBC Swiss account in 2005. He made the donation shortly after Bill Clinton attended his charity ball dressed as a Russian General.
Frank Giustra held an account at HSBC, valued at up to $10 million in 2006-2007. His first contributions to the Clinton Foundation were in 2005.
American entrepreneur Eli Broad held accounts at HSBC. He is a $1 million plus contributor to the Clinton Foundation.
Denise Rich is the ex-wife of financier and one-time international fugitive Marc Rich, who was pardoned by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office. Rich has contributed up to $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
Maintaining bank accounts in Switzerland or creating offshore corporate entities are not illegal. Representatives for Giustra and others insist that they comply with tax laws. But it is hard to escape the fact that firms such as Fonseca advertise their services as a means to minimize tax burdens and keep assets hidden.
On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has condemned what she calls “outrageous tax havens and loopholes that super-rich people across the world are exploiting.” She has also promised to shut down the “private tax system for the wealthy.”
Look for more to come out on the Clinton Global Financial Network in the months ahead.
Malcom Glazer, Randy Lerner and Enos Stanley Kroenke didn't all just become huge fans of 'soccer.' But they do all want to rule the world.
At Wembley the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers will play in front of a crowd of over 80,000 people whilst many more will watch on the BBC. But the game will be absolutely meaningless if it doesn't lead to the long term global expansion of American Football.
The plan is to set up a new NFL franchise in London. Dean Spanos, the CEO and chairman of the Chargers, says: "I think it's possible [to put a team in London], I really do. But you can't just put one team in. Maybe we'll expand into other countries in the next two or three years and maybe at some point in time add another division of international teams."
Such a move was attempted in the past but the UK failed to embrace the NFL Europe concept which ran from 1991 to 2007 and included the now-defunct London Monarchs in its early years. However, never before has the NFL had such knowledge of the English market.
In Glazer, Lerner and Kroenke they now have a trio of insiders operating within three of England's four major sporting cities. Spanos, who sits on the NFL's international committee, says: "The more we understand how you think, it has to be of benefit." The irony is that such insider knowledge wouldn't be allowed in the American sporting market. The NFL has rules that prohibit owners from taking on other sporting franchises.
Jim Steeg, Spanos's right-hand man at the Chargers and the marketing guru who previously put the super into Superbowl, says: "You can't own across sports [in America]. You don't want the competition in the market to know what you're doing." Yet English football clubs have allowed the Americans to do exactly that. It is the result of the appalling governance of the Premier League compared to the NFL.
For a new owner to come into the NFL, 24 of the 32 current owners have to agree. In contrast the Premier League has a 'fit and proper person test' that would have probably waved Adolf Hitler through.
The NFL has financial limits on the franchises so that it is impossible to get a huge debt against the teams. The Premier League has allowed a raft of American owners to come in and do precisely that. English football would do well not to underestimate the Americans, although it may already be too late. The 32 owners of the NFL teams are a fabulous mix of ethnic diversity and extreme wealth, from the grandson of Henry Ford to one of the founders of Microsoft.
Many of them are buying up their own broadcasting networks. Kroenke has an interest in the St Louis Rams, Arsenal, the Denver Nuggets basketball team (his minority holding in the Rams allows him to own across other American sports), ice hockey's Colorado Avalanche, a lacrosse team, a cable channel and a ticketing company.
That sort of synergy suggests a London NFL team is more probability than possibility. As Spanos says: "If we can get 5 or 10 per cent of the world market, that's bigger than what we've got domestically and you have to be thinking along those lines 20 years down the line."
But who in British football is asking what impact a London American Football franchise have on the market share of the capital's football teams. Not for the first time the Premier League may have failed to see what is coming and it could end up with a spiralling point of pigskin right between the eyes.

Grand Theft Auto creator Dave Jones says there is "no limit" to the future success of the gaming industry, as the title celebrates its 20th anniversary.
The developer will talk about the controversial game's legacy at a panel discussion in Dundee later this month.
Mr Jones, who also created Lemmings, will tell the event what he believes lies ahead for the computer games sector.
The Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series has sold more than 250 million copies.
The event is part of Abertay University's 20 Years of Games, which celebrates its setting up of the world's first computer gaming degree.
The university said Mr Jones was "instrumental" in establishing the degree course.

The 52-year-old, whose Reagent studio is based in Dundee, said GTA has "become part of everyday life."
He said: "I remember sitting seeing a movie at home and there being a line, "don't go all GTA on me."
"That was a surreal moment.
"GTA is now a part of everyday culture and one of the best things about any game is that it can have that level of impact.
"I suppose it's an aspiration for people who want to make games, to have that lasting legacy and impact on the world when you produce something really great."
'Unlimited potential'
Grand Theft Auto, which has been criticised for glamorising violence, allows players to take on the role of criminals, who are given various "missions" to complete.
Mr Jones said: "I still think GTA is the one game that shows how far the industry has come and what it went through was a phase of acceptance of the medium in the same way as music and movies had to.
"Initially all games were for kids and because of the technology people weren't thinking of the graphics and story.
"But then equilibrium was reached where games became like any other form of entertainment and now we accept it."

Mr Jones said he believed the industry still held "unlimited potential."
He said: "Virtual Reality has been through a cycle and Augmented Reality is about to go through a cycle, then there's streaming and YouTubers.
"There are so many changes that just catch the industry unaware every three or four years, but that keeps it interesting."
Mr Jones said he had yet to see anything in the gaming sector that could not be done in his native Dundee.
He said: "In Dundee it's the network effect of everybody knowing one another over the years."
"It's having that nucleus of a combination of experienced industry people, strong academia and support from local enterprise."
Next Level: a conversation on the future of games on 25 November also features Ukie chief executive Jo Twist, Playmob chief executive Jude Ower, journalist Will Freeman and computer arts lecturer Lynn Parker.
Goma, DR Congo - This has been a triumphant year, so far, for international justice. It began with Invisible Children's Kony2012 campaign, which, rightly or wrongly, popularised the scourge of central African war criminals with a viral video - and appeared to provoke a US military response. In March, the International Criminal Court issued its first verdict with the trial of DRC warlord Thomas Lubanga. This month, western-backed proceedings found Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sierra Leone.
These resolutions have been praised as milestones, but in the north-east of the DRC, where stability has been fragile - if not absent - since the ethnic and political ruptures of the Rwandan genocide, the quest to deliver justice to ICC-indicted Bosco "The Terminator" Ntaganda is toppling the hard-won former peace.
Exclusive: DR Congo troops shell rebel bases
Ntaganda was one of the most powerful generals in eastern Congo - but now is a man on the run, leaving an area the size of Greece destabilising in his wake. His original 2006 indictment accused him of recruiting children younger than 15 into active combat, and the ICC has now added new charges relating to alleged crimes, including murder, ethnic persecution, rape and sexual slavery, pillaging and deliberate civilian attacks.
An ethnic Tutsi warlord believed to be of Rwandan origin, Ntaganda began his career fighting against the 1994 genocide alongside Rwandan president Paul Kagame. In 2002, he became second-in-command of Thomas Lubanga's clan-based militia in Ituri district, north-east Congo. It was here that he earned his Hollywood sobriquet "The Terminator", which is referred to by the ICC. In 2002 and 2003, he allegedly commanded men to murder at least 800 civilians in and around Mongbwalu, a strategic mining town which holds some 2.5 million ounces of gold.
After that war ebbed, Ntaganda joined the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) under the leadership of another zealot, Laurent Nkunda, with whom he fought against the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide. In 2008, he is believed to have led CNDP troops in a frenzied 24-hour massacre of 150 people at Kiwanja village in North Kivu. More recently, he is understood by UN experts to be taking some $15,000 a week in taxes from smuggling operations between DRC and Rwanda.
Michael Deibert, author of Democratic Republic of Congo: Between Hope and Despair, describes Ntaganda as the "king-maker" in mineral-rich North Kivu, since his 2009 betrayal of Nkunda, which led to a secret peace deal and the integration of the CNDP into the state army. "[Ntaganda] is the lynchpin of what they have called peace in eastern Congo - peace linked with impunity because that's been the nature of the peace," he said.
Refugees flee DR Congo fighting
President Kabila has chosen, until this year, not to act on the 2006 warrant for Ntaganda's arrest. But the Lubanga verdict added more calls for his capture, and at the end of March, it seems that "The Terminator" had little choice but to defect.
A number of former CNDP officers and soldiers followed him, and, within weeks, around 600 men had joined him in Masisi, the traditional CNDP heartland. According to Human Rights Watch, he has since recruited at least 149 boys and young men aged between 12 and 20 years old - the very crime for which he was originally indicted.
At the beginning of May, a rift emerged, as a memo was emailed (on CNDP notepaper) by the defectors, citing unpaid salaries and poor living conditions as evidence of the government's failure to uphold the terms of the 2009 peace accord and as the reason for their defection. Commentators said the men were protecting Ntaganda, but the defectors denied this, calling themselves "M23" - a reference to March 23, the date of the peace deal signed three years ago.
The memo named Colonel Makenga - an ethnic Tutsi who, after fighting alongside Ntaganda in Rwanda,fell out with "The Terminator" over Nkunda's overthrow - as leader of the M23 movement. Colonel Innocent Kaina, leading a batallion of M23 rebels in Masisi, also claimed that the group did not know Ntaganda's location.
With "The Terminator" in hiding (rumoured to be in the "gorilla sector" of the region's national park), it is Makenga's M23 rebels - believed to number between 500-600 - who are fighting government troops close to the borders of Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda.
And now the Kony effect has set in. Advocacy and human rights organisations have launched "Terminator" campaigns, fuelling another virtual manhunt and internet crusade.
"If justice cannot be achieved without indiscriminate blood loss, is impunity - or at least consideration of it - too great a price to pay?"
Yet, despite his brutal history, for some Congolese Tutsis, Ntaganda symbolises the prospect of peace in their homelands, where there is still widespread persecution by Hutus. Bucamwa Munyakabuga, a refugee who has lived on a hilltop farm in northern Rwanda for 13 years, is mourning a close friend, killed this month fighting for Ntaganda.
"They're fighting so that the refugees may return to their country," he said. "I was not born in Rwanda - I am a Congo man. But now I am a refugee."
In a region such as this, where ethnic and political lines dissect official borders, few conflicts are strictly domestic. On May 14, the Congolese defence minister was sent to Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi to investigate claims that foreign influence was fuelling the clashes - reasoning that M23 arms must come from somewhere.
Defending the rights of Rwandan Tutsis, stabilising the refugee situation, and maintaining control of an illicit trade in metals and minerals are among the reasons why it could be in Rwanda's interest to support the rebels.
Rwanda does not want Ntganda tried at the Hague, and some believe President Kagame will use Makenga and M23 as his proxy power, allowing him to find his own solution to Ntaganda's sub-poena - just as Nkunda now lives in Rwanda, despite his international arrest warrant.
Anneke Van Woudenberg, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch in Goma, says that the ICC arrest warrant issued this week against Sylvestre Mudacumura, the head of the FDLR, the pro-Hutu Rwandan militia operating in eastern Congo that has killed 50 civilians already this month, is also highly significant. "Until now, all the heat has been on Bosco," she said.
In presenting Ntaganda as the sole cause of the conflict, attaching the few personal descriptions of him that exist (how "he kills easily" and "enjoys playing tennis") to doltish images of him in a leather cowboy hat, we distill the complex clashes into a handy dichotomy: the rules of international justice versus the image of impunity for African warlords.
Since April, more than 40,000 people have fled their homes, trudging through mud and rains to a point of safety - either in Congo or across the border into Rwanda or Uganda, or indeed, anywhere. While the ICC has become the cornerstone for international justice, dignity is at the core of human rights - and one must question whether it is being upheld here.
Tutsi refugees arriving in Rwanda have reported widespread physical and verbal assault, often carried out by soldiers. One man said troops took everything from him, even his baby's milk, leaving him with nothing but his underwear. Another said he watched as they looted his farm.
As the CNDP army defectors left their positions in April, militia moved in. Across the region, armed groups have been exploiting the security vacuum to feather their nests, attacking civilians and peacekeepers alike. The FDLR is fighting raia mutomboki ["angry villagers"] and killing civilians. Last week, 11 Pakistani peacekeepers were seriously injured, some shot, when around 1,000 people surrounded their South Kivu base, according to MONUSCO, the UN's peacekeeping behemoth in DRC. With Congolese troops overstretched by a number of problems, there is now a desperate need to protect civilians.
If the international community persists in a blinkered pursuit of justice manifested in the arrest of Bosco "The Terminator" Ntaganda - that is, if he survives the current fighting - it does so at the risk of taking its eye off the broader crisis unfolding in eastern Congo.
"African solutions to Africa's problems" is one of the guiding principles of the African Union that emerged from, among other things, the failure of the international community to deal with the Rwandan genocide. President Kabila justified Ntaganda's former impunity by claiming that he was crucial to the peace. Kabila is now saying that, should Ntaganda be captured, he will stand trial in DRC before being delivered to The Hague - something commentators do not believe could happen due to the country's poor judicial track record.
Observers of the current situation could conclude that President Kabila was right in granting impunity on the grounds that he was "a lynchpin of the peace process". But this is something human rights organisations have rubbished - leadership by a perpetrator of massacres could never equate to peace, they argue.
If justice cannot be achieved without massive and indiscriminate blood loss, is some degree of impunity for one man - or at least consideration of it - too great a price to pay?

Phelps was placed on the 15-day disabled list on Monday with a right forearm strain after being pulled from his Sunday start against the Cardinals after 2 1/3 innings.
MILWAUKEE -- Marlins starter David Phelps will miss the remainder of the 2015 season after an MRI exam on Monday revealed the right-hander suffered a stress fracture of the radius bone in his right forearm.
MILWAUKEE -- Marlins starter David Phelps will miss the remainder of the 2015 season after an MRI exam on Monday revealed the right-hander suffered a stress fracture of the radius bone in his right forearm.
Phelps was placed on the 15-day disabled list on Monday with a right forearm strain after being pulled from his Sunday start against the Cardinals after 2 1/3 innings.
View Full Game Coverage
"It's unfortunate," manager Dan Jennings said. "[The injury] is in a very strange spot on the top of his forearm."
The recovery time for Phelps is yet to be determined, according to Jennings, who wasn't sure if Phelps would be ready to go come Spring Training.
Rookie Kendry Flores will take Phelps' spot in the rotation. The right-hander has posted a 2.45 ERA in five games out of the bullpen for Miami this season, allowing nine hits over 7 1/3 innings.
Phelps' injury is yet another to a Marlins rotation that will now consist of three rookie starters. Flores will join Adam Conley, who started on Tuesday against the Brewers -- one day after Justin Nicolino fired 6 2/3 innings in a victory over Milwaukee.
The Marlins have now used 12 different pitchers who are 25 years old or younger this season, the most in the big leagues.
Other injury updates
• Outfielder Christian Yelich, who was placed on the 15-day DL on Saturday (retroactive to Aug. 10) also underwent an MRI exam on Monday and is fine, according to Jennings. Yelich suffered a right knee contusion.
• Right-handed pitcher Jarred Cosart (vertigo resulting from an inner ear disorder) pitched a successful simulated game on Monday, and he will make a rehab start on Saturday with the organization's Rookie level affiliate of the Gulf Coast League.
• Right-handed pitcher Jose Fernandez (right biceps strain) will begin throwing from 75 feet. Fernandez was able to throw up to 60 feet on Monday.
• Reliever Carter Capps (right elbow strain) will throw a bullpen session on Thursday, and reliever Andre Rienzo (left knee laceration) will throw one on Wednesday. Rienzo will also throw live batting practice before the end of the week.
Just about every Atlanta Falcons linebacker will be out for Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos. Based on practice reports from two beat writers, Atlanta's defensive standout player won't play against Denver.
Deion Jones not practicing again today off ankle injury. Looks like he wont play Sunday — vaughn mcclure (@vxmcclure23) October 7, 2016
This will be a huge problem if we hope to slow down Gary Kubiak's offense, which, similar to Kyle Shanahan's offense, runs a wide zone that can expose a front seven with a lack of speed. Not only that, Jones has been making plays left and right all season. He was a popular pick for defensive player of the year and rookie of the year in the Falcoholic's four game awards.
Who will replace Jones? It looks like Philip Wheeler will fill in at weakside with LaRoy Reynolds manning the middle. Wheeler has plenty of prior starting experience and should hold up OK despite his inconsistent play. The bigger question will be LaRoy Reynolds who has four career starts since 2013. He made four tackles against the Carolina Panthers and didn't look too bad. Career underachiever A.J. Hawk was signed to backup Reynolds.
The Broncos will be starting either rookie Paxton Lynch or inured Trevor Siemian at quarterback, so they should be running the ball early and often against Atlanta. Lets see how well the team can do without Jones.
Update: That did not take too long. The Atlanta Falcons officially ruled out the star linebacker for Sunday's game. This is a big hit to a defense that is already pretty bad.
This article is about a geographic region in Spain. For the German ship of the same name, see SMS Cap Trafalgar
Cape Trafalgar (;[1] Spanish: Cabo Trafalgar [ˈkaβo tɾafalˈɣaɾ]) is a headland in the Province of Cádiz in the south-west of Spain. The 1805 naval Battle of Trafalgar, in which the Royal Navy commanded by Admiral Horatio Nelson decisively defeated Napoleon's combined Spanish and French fleet, took place off the cape.
It lies on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the Strait of Gibraltar. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the Western limit of the strait and the Mediterranean Sea as a line that joins Cape Trafalgar to the North to Cape Spartel to the south.
The most prominent structure on the cape is a 34-metre-high lighthouse (51 metres above sea level), the faro de Cabo Trafalgar, built in 1860.
Etymology [ edit ]
The name is of Arabic origin, deriving either from Taraf al-Ghar (طرف الغار 'cape of the cave/laurel'),[2][3][4], or from Taraf al-Gharb (طرف الغرب 'cape of the west')[5][4] In both cases, taraf (طرف) means 'edge' or 'extremity' and refers to a promontory.[citation needed] In modern Arabic, however, the place is sometimes re-transcribed as al-Taraf al-Aghar (الطرف الأغر).[6]

Jean Kabre is the concierge and event planner at 101 Constitution — a place full of people focused on power, influencing top leaders, and sweeping changes that affect the whole country. But when word got out that Kabre was helping support dozens of family members in his home village in Burkina Faso, the people whom Kabre had come to know as his friends, pitched in at astounding levels.

Jean Kabre is the concierge and event planner at 101 Constitution — a place full of people focused on power, influencing top leaders, and sweeping changes that affect the whole country. But when word got out that Kabre was helping support dozens of family members in his home village in Burkina Faso, the people whom Kabre had come to know as his friends, pitched in at astounding levels.
Late for a job interview, stressed out and starting to panic, Mindi Mebane asked the building concierge for directions in the lobby of the marble and granite office building at 101 Constitution Ave., its hallways a bustle of lobbyists and power brokers. He didn't just point the way. He led her to her destination and introduced her to her future boss, chatting warmly the whole time.
Just about everyone at 101 Constitution has a story like that about Jean Kabre. It's not just the ways that he helps them, smoothing over security for crucial meetings with Cabinet members, ensuring the details are perfect for a reception. It's more the way he has helped unite the hundreds of people who work there, turning what could be a cold, hectic place into something friendlier, more like a neighborhood.
So when the tenants found out that their concierge was not only supporting four children and his mother at home in Woodbridge but also an enormous family living in poverty in Burkina Faso, they were at first astonished. Then they wanted to help.
That's how 101 Constitution, the commercial building closest to the U.S. Capitol, came together to help Kabre's small African village.
“I knew it was on his heart,” said Dirk Kempthorne, a former secretary of the interior, senator and two-term governor of Idaho, and now the head of the American Council of Life Insurers. So Kempthorne offered the council's luxurious space and veranda atop 101 Constitution for a fundraiser for Kabre's village this fall. He hopes to make the fundraiser an annual event.

It started several years ago with small individual efforts such as writing a check to buy a goat. Then employees banded together to raise enough money to build a well to provide safe drinking water for the village. Now it includes such ambitious goals as food, education, housing, pursuing land rights and a business plan to make the village of Tintilou self-sufficient.
It's all still hard for Kabre to believe.
There's no tax write-off for helping Tintilou. But then again, Kabre's friends say, there's no overhead. Everything at a recent fundraiser was donated, down to the tiniest hors d'oeuvre from Charlie Palmer Steak. In an earlier fundraising appeal, donors saw video and photos of the hand-dug well that was there, full of frogs. An American consultant was asked to visit the village. And a worker at 101 Constitution with expertise in water hired an engineer from Ouagadougou, the capital city, to go to Tintilou, assess the problem and build a solution.
And then the tenants of 101 Constitution heard the results of their gift immediately and directly from Kabre: how the well ensured that villagers weren't getting sick any more from dirty water, how the children no longer had to walk for miles to find water when their hand-dug well dried up, how people from all over visited the well, day and night.
Some were touched by Kabre's own generosity; he had been raising more than $10,000 a year for leukemia research for years before anyone knew that he and his immediate family were in need. He didn't ask for help, even as he worried about water bills at his home in Woodbridge or mud huts collapsing in Tintilou. Some were inspired by his hard work to create a better life, something he dismisses as almost universal. There are millions of people like him here in the United States, he says. Or in Burkina Faso, “talk to anyone else. This is our life. This is our life.”
Kabre laughed, a booming laugh that cascaded into giggles and head-shaking, when he tried to imagine how his family in Tintilou would react to 101 Constitution. They could not imagine such a place, he said. It's all business suits and expense accounts, with sweeping views of the Washington Monument.
Tintilou is poor: No electricity, no running water, not enough food.
“They go through so much hard times and struggles but yet, they're joyful and happy,” Kabre said. “Everyone knows everyone; everyone takes care of everyone.”
Kabre's family is huge. His father had seven wives, which is common in the region. Kabre, who's 54, is the oldest of 29 children. His youngest brother is 10.
When his father died, the responsibility of supporting the family fell to him.
As a child, Kabre slept on a mat in a small, round mud hut with his mother and four other children. He remembers his mother looking at the sky, praying for one more rain. Without it, they would go to bed with a glass of water instead of a plate of millet or sorghum.
Family members dug for water, often chasing away creatures before drinking it. They were sick a lot.
At 13, with his first pair of shoes (flip-flops) and a ticket that his mother purchased, he boarded a train for the Ivory Coast.
In Abidjan, where he had been sleeping under the steps of a building, a young woman offered him a job with her father. He became a butler in their home, and after years there, considers them a second family. So much so that, when he was able to get a visa to work in the United States, the daughters, who had moved to Washington, offered him a room so that he had time to get on his feet.
He started as a night cleaner in a hotel, learning English (his fourth language) with flashcards. After moving up the ranks, job by job, to hotel concierge, a regular guest asked if Kabre wanted to work for him at a new building near the Capitol. Instead of working two jobs and rushing home to try to see his children before they fell asleep, he could have one job with a good salary.
Now he is the concierge and events coordinator. “I can't explain the blessings that come to me from 101 Constitution,” he said recently, widening his eyes. “Sometimes I say, ‘Who am I? What did I do to deserve all this?' ”
Kabre laughed when someone suggested drilling a well: It sounded absurd, impossible.
He has only been back to Tintilou a few times. But in December, he was able to see the well built in 2008.
He saw one brother using the water to grow cabbage and tomatoes and onions, even some extra crops that he could sell. He saw people using the water to make mud to build homes. And he saw how bad the drought had become there, how fruit trees had died and crops had failed, how hungry his family was.
“I get mad when people complain,” he said recently. “Here, if you look around you can only count your blessings. There is nothing to complain about.”
A small group of colleagues helped him set goals after he visited in December and saw the impact of drought on Tintilou. The colleagues keep track of donations and give Kabre the money when they have plans in place. He wires the money to a brother there.
This fall, the fundraiser at the building raised almost $14,000, which bought millet and rice, and paid tuition for the children. The employees hope to start building tiny concrete houses to replace the mud huts, construct one bathroom at the market and buy a grain grinder that would allow Kabre's family to earn money and become self-reliant. Lawyers have offered to help with land-rights issues and the complicated process of forming a nonprofit group, and other colleagues have been talking with established nonprofit organizations working in Africa, to see whether any would be willing to partner with them.
“What is happening is just amazing, just incredible,” Kabre said.
“I sometimes think: If this building wasn't here, God's mercy and grace. If 101 wasn't there – not just to me. All those people. I turn and look at all these people going back and forth, back and forth, making a living. People come, they have jobs. They make new friends. A lot of friends!”
He started laughing again, rubbing tears from his eyes.

Even though his landline service was working fine, a man in Virginia was recently told by Verizon that he had two weeks to switch to the company's fiberoptic service or lose his account altogether.
This is according to Ars Technica, which tells the tale of John, a Northern Virginia man who recently experienced an outage of his landline service that had nothing to do with the copper line running to or through his home, but with a network error farther up the line.
Had he not noticed or brought the error to Verizon's attention, we wouldn't be telling you about John, but by filing a ticket with the telecom titan, he inadvertently started a process that ultimately resulted in him ditching Verizon.
After bringing the outage to Verizon's attention, he checked in with the company about his ticket. That's when he tells Ars that his issue had somehow gone from being an outage complaint to a request for installation of fiber at his home.
Verizon even called him to try to set up an appointment to make the change-over from copper to fiber. Not wanting to switch and not thrilled with being compelled to switch without notice, he said no.
Meanwhile, John's landline service eventually came back to life without anyone having to come do anything at his house. But that's not the end, obviously.
On June 18, he received a letter from a regional Verizon executive saying that because “you declined transitioning service to our fiber network to resolve your issue… we will no longer be able to provide service to your home,” even though the upgrade to fiber was not needed to resolve the issue.
The letter only gave John until July 3 to make his decision or his “Verizon home service account will be closed.”
In the end, July 3 came and went without his landline turning into a pumpkin (and without explanation from anyone), but John decided to switch his landline service — not to FiOS but to the VOIP service offered by his cable/broadband provider. It may not offer the same access to a dial tone during a local power outage, but it's less expensive than Verizon, and well… it's just not Verizon.
“I'm still canceling Verizon even if it's still working because this whole experience has been pretty unsavory,” he tells Ars.
John's story is not dissimilar from a recent item we brought you about a New Jersey woman who was receiving letters from Verizon saying she'd lose landline service if she didn't upgrade immediately to FiOS.
Telecom worker unions have accused Verizon of deliberately neglecting its copper line network, alleging that the company is fudging its service numbers to make it look like they are making prompt repairs to these lines. Verizon denies these claims and says the union is only using them as a negotiation tool.

After her boyfriend suddenly broke up with her, 19-year-old Emma Vowell turned to Tinder, like most young people may do—but not for the reasons you may think.
Vowell, a sophomore at Purdue University in Indiana, said her boyfriend broke up with her after she had bought a pair of skydiving tickets above the Chicago skyline as a surprise birthday gift. Rather than letting the November-expiring tickets go to waste, she advertised the tickets on her Tinder bio. Vowell said her ex was devastated when he found out she had bought the tickets but she wasn't going to take him.

In her Tinder bio, she said said she was “deadass” only looking for a guy to go skydiving with her, and was not interested in hooking up.
Shortly after posting her ad to Tinder, Vowell began receiving messages and even resumes from guys who were interested in her offer.
One of the contenders—who is also a student at Purdue University—Austin Bates, sent a professional resume and an entire cover letter to the newly single sophomore.
“Dear Ms. Emma, I recently saw your advertisement on the dating application Tinder, and am very interested in filling the position you had listed,” Bates said in the cover letter.
He said he could be the attractive guy she was looking for to go skydiving with, and nothing other than that. Bates said although he has plans to skydive in Hawaii next year, he would rather not wait so long to experience the thrill.
As far as compensation goes, Bates listed a number of benefits he could give to Vowell—and not the typical Tinder benefits you may be thinking.
“I would be willing to drive you to class, exams, [and] bars for a week of your choosing in my doorless Jeep,” Bates said. “I also live with a one-year-old German shepherd-husky mix, that I will let you pet, walk with, or send you pictures of any time your heart desires.”
Bates concluded by saying he could also offer free 1-on-1 personal fitness training and cover the costs of food, lodging, and gas.

Guys, he even made a resumé pic.twitter.com/OgJTGMppRH — Em (@emma_vowell) September 26, 2017
Vowell posted the “application” on Twitter saying Bates was the most dedicated guy to ever “shoot his shot” and asked whether or not she should take him skydiving. This post received a lot of mix feelings about whether or not Bates should be “hired” for the position.
Some were impressed by his effort and thought he deserved to be her skydive date.
take him jesus — dawson king (@Trashpanda_god) September 27, 2017

Others were less impressed by the quality of his resume.
Resume has terrible formatting turn him down — You (@whooismax) September 26, 2017

Dude won't get anywhere with that resume! DENIED! — Corey Freeman (@asap_freeman) September 27, 2017
Then there were the ones who had some strong critiques for the resume, but thought he deserved an A for effort.
His verbs on his experiences aren't great action verbs and have different tenses, but he should get extra credit for effort — Taylor Sanders (@tayman47) September 27, 2017
Those margin/tabs make my head hurt. But sure — GenerationInk (@GenerationInk) September 27, 2017
Poorly formatted resume but rather persistent and concise. He deserves it — Connor Claussen (@connoraclaus) September 27, 2017
After her tweets about Bates went viral, other applicants began sending their resumes her way. One guy from Virginia even found her on LinkedIn to send his application.
This guy fr found me on LinkedIn. I think I've found my new favorite way of dating. #SendMeUrResume #ThenWeCanTalk pic.twitter.com/VkOsZwdEFa — Em (@emma_vowell) September 27, 2017
In the end, it was Bates who impressed Vowell the most and earned the position of being her skydiving date. Some of her Twitter followers were deeply involved with the application process and happy to see Bates chosen.
ANYWAY

Even Tinder agreed that Bates was the perfect choice—and offered her a job.
You clearly have good judgment @emma_vowell – we liked Austin's resume too. Tinder loves working with creative people like you and Austin. How does a job with Tinder sound? (we're serious, dm us) https://t.co/ADsjvNHhGn — Tinder (@Tinder) September 28, 2017

Researchers from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa's School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and University of California – Berkeley discovered that interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) could deliver water and organics to the Earth and other terrestrial planets.
Interplanetary dust, dust that has come from comets, asteroids, and leftover debris from the birth of the solar system, continually rains down on the Earth and other Solar System bodies. These particles are bombarded by solar wind, predominately hydrogen ions. This ion bombardment knocks the atoms out of order in the silicate mineral crystal and leaves behind oxygen that is more available to react with hydrogen, for example, to create water molecules.
“It is a thrilling possibility that this influx of dust has acted as a continuous rainfall of little reaction vessels containing both the water and organics needed for the eventual origin of life on Earth and possibly Mars,” said Hope Ishii, new Associate Researcher in the Hawaiʻi Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP) at UH Mānoa's SOEST and co-author of the study. This mechanism of delivering both water and organics simultaneously would also work for exoplanets, worlds that orbit other stars. These raw ingredients of dust and hydrogen ions from their parent star would allow the process to happen in almost any planetary system.
Implications of this work are potentially huge: Airless bodies in space such as asteroids and the Moon, with ubiquitous silicate minerals, are constantly being exposed to solar wind irradiation that can generate water. In fact, this mechanism of water formation would help explain remotely sensed data of the Moon, which discovered OH and preliminary water, and possibly explains the source of water ice in permanently shadowed regions of the Moon.
“Perhaps more exciting,” said Hope Ishii, Associate Researcher in HIGP and co-author of the study, “interplanetary dust, especially dust from primitive asteroids and comets, has long been known to carry organic carbon species that survive entering the Earth's atmosphere, and we have now demonstrated that it also carries solar-wind-generated water. So we have shown for the first time that water and organics can be delivered together.”
It has been known since the Apollo-era, when astronauts brought back rocks and soil from the Moon, that solar wind causes the chemical makeup of the dust's surface layer to change. Hence, the idea that solar wind irradiation might produce water-species has been around since then, but whether it actually does produce water has been debated. The reasons for the uncertainty are that the amount of water produced is small and it is localized in very thin rims on the surfaces of silicate minerals so that older analytical techniques were unable to confirm the presence of water.
Using a state-of-the-art transmission electron microscope, the scientists have now actually detected water produced by solar-wind irradiation in the space-weathered rims on silicate minerals in interplanetary dust particles. Futher, on the bases of laboratory-irradiated minerals that have similar amorphous rims, they were able to conclude that the water forms from the interaction of solar wind hydrogen ions (H+) with oxygen in the silicate mineral grains.
This recent work does not suggest how much water may have been delivered to Earth in this manner from IDPs.
“In no way do we suggest that it was sufficient to form oceans, for example,” said Ishii. “However, the relevance of our work is not the origin of the Earth's oceans but that we have shown continuous, co-delivery of water and organics intimately intermixed.”
In future work, the scientists will attempt to estimate water abundances delivered to Earth by IDPs. Further, they will explore in more detail what other organic (carbon-based) and inorganic species are present in the water in the vesicles in interplanetary dust rims.

Source: Bulls GM Gar Forman misled Jimmy Butler before trade
BLOOMINGTON, Minn. — For a week, Jimmy Butler has sat back and listened to the criticism. Former NBA All-Star Antoine Walker called him “a bad locker-room guy.” Local TV personalities said he's not the kind of guy you build around. Others noted how “Hollywood” he became in recent seasons.
On Thursday, the former Bulls All-Star had an answer for all of it.
“It's not frustrating,'” Butler said, meeting the Minnesota media for the first time since the Bulls traded him to the Timberwolves last week. “It's expected. Somebody's gotta take the blame. I'll be that guy — I'm OK with it. Everybody is entitled to their opinion, but with that being said, my phone is in my back pocket right now. If whoever has anything to say to me, feel free . . . 773-899-6071. So if you want an interview, there you have it. Please do. Remember that.”
One person who won't likely be calling Butler anytime soon is Bulls general manager Gar Forman. After the trade last week, Forman said on two occasions that Butler had been kept informed of what was going on leading up to it and that he never lied to Butler or his representatives.

However, a source close to the situation told the Sun-Times on Thursday that Forman's version of events doesn't match what happened in the days — and even the minutes — leading up to the draft-night deal.
“[Forman] knows what he said,” the source said. “That's just who he is. Travelle [Gaines] hit it on the head.”
Gaines, who has been Butler's trainer, sent out a tweet minutes after the trade was announced. It read, “0-82. Worst culture in the league. I met drug dealers with better morals then their GM. He is a liar and everyone knows.”
Reached for comment Thursday, Forman said in a text message, “Absolutely false! Never talked with Jimmy again after John [Paxson] and I had our meeting with him several weeks prior to the draft.”
Given the chance Thursday to comment, Butler took the high road.
“I already said how much love I have for the city of Chicago,” he said. “I don't have anything to say about anybody in that organization, in that city. They took a chance on a kid from Tomball, [Texas], who didn't know where he belonged. But now this new chapter, this new era, I'm looking forward to it.”
Timberwolves coach Tom Thibo-deau — Butler's coach with the Bulls before his own ugly break-up with Forman and Paxson — stepped in.
“Jimmy knows this: Whether it's praise or criticism, to treat it the same,” Thibodeau said. “The only thing that really matters is what we think, and we think he's a great player and a great addition.
“For the most part, our experience [in Chicago] was great. We won a lot of games together. Jimmy achieved greatness there. We're not going to get lost in any sideshows or distractions.”

This was not one of Mozilla's most shining moments. In response to business complaints about Firefox's accelerating release schedule Firefox evangelist Asa Dotzler responded:
Enterprise has never been (and I'll argue, shouldn't be) a focus of ours. Until we run out of people who don't have sysadmins and enterprise deployment teams looking out for them, I can't imagine why we'd focus at all on the kinds of environments you care so much about.
Adding insult to injury, Dotzler followed up with:
Years ago, we [Mozilla] didn't have the resources. Today, I argue, we shouldn't care even if we do have the resources because of the cost benefit trade. A minute spent making a corporate user happy can better be spent making many regular users happy. I'd much rather Mozilla spending its limited resources looking out for the billions of users that don't have enterprise support systems already taking care of them.
Wow That's certainly not the way I learned to win friends and influence others.
Now, though, Jay Sullivan, Mozilla's vice president of products, is sort of, kind of, offering a peace-pipe to enterprise network administrators. Sullivan wrote on the Mozilla blog that:
Mozilla is committed to providing the best Web experience for people everywhere, for whom the Web has become such an important part of their daily lives. Providing updates to Firefox more frequently allows us to secure users against emerging threats and provide the platform for innovation that today's rich and compelling Web experiences demand. The Mozilla Community has focused our efforts on the needs of the individual user, and prioritized the product roadmap and features accordingly. However, as is the case with many technologies, loyal Firefox users and their IT departments have sought to bring Firefox into their places of work. A key challenge for enterprises is that they need to certify their websites, apps and add-ons each time Firefox is updated. This can take weeks or months. Security is also paramount, enterprises need access to a version that includes all known security fixes.
While I didn't expect Mozilla to disown Dotzler comments, I did expect better from them. I mean, besides the Mozilla Foundation, there is its wholly owned subsidary, the Mozilla Corp., which was meant to generate profits--one presumes from both end-users including businesses--that would then be funneled back into the non-profit Foundation.
Yes, it's great that Mozilla is focused on individual users, but really, what's so hard about working with enterprises as well? I'm not crazy about Firefox 5 or Firefox's manic "a new major release" every six-weeks plan. But, what I'd really like to see is Mozilla working at making Firefox easier to deploy and management in an enterprise. This isn't rocket science.
I also didn't care for the way Mozilla put the burden of working with Firefox on the enterprise. If Firefox really wants businesses to "certify their websites, apps and add-ons each time Firefox is updated," then they need to slow their major release schedule down so that business can keep in step.
Is that too much to ask for? I don't think so.
Otherwise, Firefox may actually increase the pace that users are turning to Google Chrome or, even, believe it or not, boost Internet Explorer's market share at Firefox's expense. Is ignoring enterprise concerns really a good plan? I don't think so.

This gorgeous, luscious stir-fry will knock your socks off! It's so easy to make and is big on flavor, and here's my favorite thing about it: You can prep all the veggies and make the sauce up to 24 hours in advance, and just keep them in separate containers in the fridge. Then, when you get home after a crazy-long day, all you have to do is heat the oil in a skillet and you'll have dinner within about 12.112983474 minutes.
Serve it over rice. Serve it over noodles. Eat it straight out of the skillet, it doesn't matter.
I could eat dishes like this every day for the rest of my life.
(Pssst. This recipe is in my new “Dinnertime” cookbook, which will be out tomorrow! I've been workin' hard on this one and I'm excited it's finally here. In other news, I need to get back on the treadmill fast.)
In a small bowl, mix together some soy sauce, sherry, brown sugar, cornstarch, sriracha, and fresh ginger. Yum! Set this aside for a second.
Heat some oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add some chunks of onion and chunks of bell pepper. I used red and yellow, but you can use green or even purple if you have them! The veggies you use in this dish are up to you. Just add the firmer veggies first, to give them a chance to cook.
Stir the veggies around the pan for a couple of minutes to let them start cooking. You want them to get some nice color on the outside, so if you need to crank up the heat a little more, feel free!
Then add some minced garlic and cook it for about a minute more, stirring continuously to make sure the garlic doesn't burn.
Now you can start throwing in the other veggies! Add big chunks of zucchini…
And stir it in, cooking for 2 minutes more.
Next up: Broccoli!
Stir and cook this for a couple of minutes, too.
And finally: halved baby corn from a can or jar…and okay. I don't know if this is technically a veggie. But it doesn't really fit into any other category, so I'm going with it.
While the veggies are still somewhat firm, pour in the sauce…
Then stir it and cook it for 1 to 2 minutes more, or until the sauce is very thick. If you feel the veggies need a little more sauciness, stir in 1/4 to 1/2 cup hot water and splash in a little more soy. Easy!
Serve it by itself, over rice, or over noodles! (These are chow mein noodles, and they have little carrots in them. Didn't want that to confuse anyone.)
Sprinkle the whole thing with sesame seeds if it makes your skirt fly up. Delicious!
Here's the handy dandy printable.
• Spanish midfielder to have medical on Thursday • Pep Guardiola turns to Alonso after losing Toni Kroos • Alonso retires from international football
Xabi Alonso is on the verge of joining the German champions, Bayern Munich, on a two-year deal worth around £8m (€10m).
The former Liverpool midfielder, who on Wednesday announced his retirement from international football with Spain, is due for a medical at Bayern on Thursday as talks between the two clubs continue.
FC Bayern English (@FCBayernEN) #FCBayern can confirm talks with @XabiAlonso & @realmadriden. Spaniard expected for a medical today. More soon on http://t.co/z5SEWp6rQd
Bavaria's manager, Pep Guardiola, turned his attention to Alonso after the departure of Toni Kroos and the knee-ligament injury suffered by Javi Martínez. Alonso had two years left to run on his deal at Real Madrid and he turns 33 in November. His salary in Germany will be about €1m less than he was earning at Madrid.
Throughout last season Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, insisted repeatedly on Alonso's importance for the side. He missed the Champions League final through suspension after picking up a booking in the semi-final. In his absence, Madrid rarely functioned with the same fluidity. Yet, at boardroom level, the approach from Bayern Munich was welcomed.
The arrival of Kroos brought competition for Alonso, even if Ancelotti at first appeared likely to play the two together. But as discussions continued, Alonso did not play for Madrid in their opening league game of the season against Cordoba on Monday. Alonso was one of four deep-lying central midfielders along with Kroos, Asier Illarramendi and Sami Khedira, while the arrival of James Rodríguez increased the number of midfielders further, nudging him closer to a departure.
Great Britain has won the Palma Trophy for the fourth consecutive time with a record-breaking score, beating eight other countries' top shots to be crowned champions in one of the world's oldest and most prestigious international shooting competitions.
GB's team of sixteen shooters, captained by Jane Messer – the first female Palma team captain – posted a record score of 7106 points with 827 V-bulls, beating runners-up the USA by 79 points. The Americans scored 7035 and 719 V-bulls, while South Africa came third with a score of 7010 and 705 V-bulls.
Shot every four years, the modern Palma Match is contested over two days between teams of 16 firers. Competing at Camp Perry, Ohio, this year, the teams fought it out at distances of 800yds, 900yds and 1000yds. In addition to the firers each team includes four wind coaches, a main wind coach, the captain and an adjutant, as well as two reserve firers and an armourer. Wind coaches adjust the firers' sights between shots to ensure gusts of wind do not blow them off target.
British shooter Toby Raincock, team adjutant, set a new individual record, posting a score of 449 with 55 V-bulls from a maximum possible score of 450 with 90 V-bulls. The previous record was set in 2011 by fellow British shooter Nigel Ball (also a member of this year's team) with a score of 446 and 44 V-bulls.
The previous team record was also set by GB at the last match in 2011, when they posted a score of 7027 points. Other records broken by GB in the match include the first time a team has won all six ranges (posting the highest score at each distance on each day) and being the first team to win the Palma four times in a row in the modern era.
Each Palma shooter fires 15 scoring shots at each distance, with each shot scoring a maximum value of 5 (the bullseye). The highest possible score for each firer at each distance is 75 with 15 V-bulls. The V-bull is a bull-within-a-bull, still scoring 5 but noted separately, in addition to the full score. In Palma shooting the V-bull has a diameter of 255mm (just over 10 inches) at all distances, while the black circular aiming mark is 1.12 metres wide.
Rifles used in the Palma Match fire a 7.62mm bullet. Under the match rules, the rifles are fitted with open sights; no telescopes are used for aiming. Shooters must line up the sights by eye in order to hit the targets, which are more than half a mile away.
Other competing nations this year were Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the West Indies and Germany.
Great Britain's team was captained by Jane Messer. The main coach was Martin Townsend. Notable firers included David Luckman and Parag Patel, both 2014 Commonwealth games gold medallists, and David Calvert, this year's winner of HM the Queen's Prize for fullbore rifle shooting at the world-renowned Imperial Meeting, held at the National Shooting Centre in Surrey.
The Palma Match is one of the oldest international sporting competitions in the world, having been inaugurated in 1876 with a match between America, Canada, Ireland and Scotland. It is contested every four years between countries who are members of the International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations.

This Wednesday's “Modern Family” will include an openly transgender child actor.
In the upcoming episode — entitled “A Stereotypical Day” — parents Cameron “Cam” (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) permit their daughter Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) to have her transgender friend Tom over for a play-date. Both parents are filled with pride that they have done well in raising an accepting and open-minded child. But that pride quickly diminishes when Lily insults her friend, which they use as a teachable moment.
Lily's playmate Tom will be played by 8-year-old transgender actor Jackson Millarker.
Ryan Case, a director on “Modern Family,” posted a photo of Millarker on set with the caption: “This is Jackson Millarker. He's 8 years old, from Atlanta, and just happens to be transgender. He plays Lily's friend Tom in this week's Modern Family and he's wonderful. One of the many reasons I love being a part of this show.”
“Modern Family” is not the first TV series to feature a transgender child. For one, “Transparent's” third season, which just launched on Amazon last Friday, features a trans kid actress, who plays a young Maura in a 1950's flashback scene, trying on clothes when she gets yelled at by her father.
Jeffrey Tambor, who stars as Maura on “Transparent,” recently said he wants to see more trans actors in trans roles. “I would not be unhappy if I were the last cisgender male to play a female transgender on television,” the actor said during his Emmy acceptance speech earlier this month.
“Modern Family” has had 77 Emmy nominations and taken home 22 of the awards. The ABC sitcom is tied with “Frasier” for most wins in the Outstanding Comedy Series category (2010-2014). “Modern Family” premiered in Sept. 23, 2009. It's currently in it's eighth season.
“A Stereotypical Day” will air on Wednesday at 9/8c on ABC.

Roads in city centre blocked as fleet of fire engines sent in to tackle overnight blaze near imperial arch
Fire has ripped through a building in Manchester's Chinatown, yards from the quarter's imperial arch.
The huge blaze began at about 2.15am and threatened to cause disruption as shoppers head out to grab Black Friday deals.
A fleet of fire engines sent to tackle the flames illuminated the decorative gateway at the peak of the blaze and blocked city centre roads.

Phil Nelson, group manager of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue, said: “Crews are still working hard to extinguish the building. We're using two aerial appliances which have worked well in containing the fire and preventing spread to other buildings.
“We're working with police to see if we can get the road closures opened before the morning rush-hour traffic.”
Firefighters were forced to keep back from the severely damaged multi-storey commercial building due to falling debris.
The fire brigade said the blaze was contained by about 6am but Portland Street, Princess Street and Faulkner Street remained closed and anyone travelling to the area was urged to find alternative routes.
The fires that continue to ravage New South Wales have so far claimed life and destroyed countless homes. The images from news helicopters tell part of the story, but now we know what really looks like to fight these fires on the front line, thanks to a Mount Victoria firefighter's helmet-mounted GoPro camera.
The firefighter, hailing from the Blackheath/Mount Victoria Rural Fire Service, mounted a GoPro camera to his helmet before fighting the insane bushfires that continue to burn throughout the state.
This video looks to have been taken on Friday, when the fires were at their most fierce, and it shows the firey running into a backyard to survey the oncoming fire-front, before going car to car, telling residents that it's too late to leave and they need to stay where they are.
Terrifying stuff.
The Rural Fire Service is a volunteer firefighting organisation that runs on donations, and they have been doing amazing work to put out the blazes around the state. You can donate to their life-saving work right here.
While it hasn't yet decided to offer a cloud computing service, Hewlett-Packard today said it will combine its high-performance computing unit with it's Web 2.0 and cloud computing infrastructure businesses to create the Scalability Computing Initiative, a name that will refer both to a business unit of HP and a set of hardware, software and services tied to scalable computing.
It also followed its competitors and introduced what HP believes will be the building block for the scalable data center, a new, two-in-one blade server. Like IBM's iDataPlex, Sun's Blackbox and Dell's cloud computing efforts, HP is viewing the noise around cloud computing as a chance to sell more hardware — specialized, HP-built 10u racks of 32 blade servers containing 128 cores, to be exact.

I don't know how important it is to build out scalable computing efforts with IBM's iDataPlex or HP's offerings rather than an array of commodity x86 boxes, but the merging of high-performance computing and cloud computing infrastructure is a triumph of the grid architecture running specialized software. It's also the same trend that is leading Cray to work with Intel on designing the next generation of supercomputers.
HP's blade servers are designed to save space in the data centers, but Paul Miller, a VP of marketing with HP, acknowledged that space was not at the premium that power is. Blade servers run pretty hot so it's counterintuitive to think that cramming two of them in one blade makes much sense from an energy efficiency point of view. Miller said HP's offering can be used with standard HP racks for water cooling or in conjunction with its Dynamic Smart Cooling technology. Without knowing how many watts are consumed, it's hard to judge how energy efficient these blades are.
Update: HP has provided more information with regard to the server's efficiency saying it ran in tests at 165 watts per server, and emphasizes that the servers are 60 % more efficient than stand alone boxes in part because they combine two servers into one shell, requiring one fan and power supply for double to compute power.
Fox Interactive Media is one of HP's clients, so clearly there's a market for HP's brand of two-in-one blades, but HP will have to compete with existing hardware vendors such as Rackable and Silicon Metrics, who seem to be doing fine providing energy-efficient scalable hardware for Web 2.0 and cloud computing companies.
US President Barack Obama speaks after visiting hurricane Sandy affeected neighborhood in Brigantine, New Jersey, on October 31, 2012. Americans sifted through the wreckage of superstorm Sandy on Wednesday as millions remained without power. The storm carved a trail of devastation across New York City and New Jersey, killing dozens of people in several states, swamping miles of coastline, and throwing the tied-up White House race into disarray just days before the vote.

As the presidential campaign enters its final days, and with Mitt Romney showing small but substantial polling deficits in key swing states, prominent conservatives are making what appears to be their final gambit of the election: turning Hurricane Sandy into a liability for President Barack Obama.
On Friday night, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Romney surrogate, appeared on "Piers Morgan Tonight" to argue that Obama has fallen short in his response to the superstorm, which ravaged parts of New York and New Jersey this week. In particular, Giuliani argued that Obama was neglecting his duties as commander in chief by continuing with campaign stops in Las Vegas and Ohio after touring disaster areas in New Jersey on Wednesday.
Said Giuliani:
I don't know what the heck [Obama] was doing in Nevada, when people were still being discovered in New York. If I were the president of the United States, I sure wouldn't be flitting around the Midwest and the West. My job would be making sure this thing was followed through to the very end. Maybe the first couple of days he was keeping his eye on the ball, but we've got gas lines now that are a mile long. We've got bodies that are still being discovered. And we've got a president who's playing campaigner in chief.
Several other conservative figures have mimicked that line of attack. Fox News host Sean Hannity tweeted:
@GovChristie #NJ #Sandy hmm was he in Vegas or Ohio bashing Romney? Did he mention when NY and NJ might get some gas? — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 3, 2012
Republican strategist Patrick Ruffini predicted that the Sandy recovery effort would become a political liability in coming days, much the way Hurricane Katrina did for the Bush administration in 2005:
Storm reaction has the potential to turn really bad for the government in the next 48 hours. This is when it happened for Katrina. — Patrick Ruffini (@PatrickRuffini) November 3, 2012
Meanwhile, conservative website Breitbart.com adorned its front page with a banner headline reading, "New Jersey An 'Apocalyptic Vision' Two Days After Obama Photo Op."
While the recovery effort does remain far from finished, the notion that Obama has ignored it in order to focus on campaigning falls flat under scrutiny. Obama has maintained an active role in the hurricane recovery, even after he returned to the campaign trail, and has routinely been in communication with governors and local lawmakers while flying on Air Force One.
On Friday, responding to severe fuel shortages in storm-affected areas, the White House ordered the Department of Defense to "deliver 12 million gallons each of gasoline and diesel fuel, mostly from commercial suppliers, to staging areas in New Jersey," according to The New York Times. It also authorized the tapping of the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve for the first time.
On Saturday, the president will continue to oversee the federal government's response to Sandy.
Per The Associated Press:
Whoa! Google Chrome has crashed. Restart now? While Google's Chrome team is cheering, Rishi Narang from Evil Fingers is typing and releasing a proof of concept for a denial of service vulnerability that is successfully crashing the Chrome browser with all tabs. According to Narang's advisory :
“An issue exists in how chrome behaves with undefined-handlers in chrome.dll version 0.2.149.27. A crash can result without user interaction. When a user is made to visit a malicious link, which has an undefined handler followed by a 'special' character, the chrome crashes with a Google Chrome message window “Whoa! Google Chrome has crashed. Restart now?”. It crashes on “int 3″ at 0×01002FF3 as an exception/trap, followed by “POP EBP” instruction when pointed out by the EIP register at 0×01002FF4.”
Nothing's impossible the impossible just takes a little longer.
Also see: Google Chrome vulnerable to carpet-bombing flaw
Whenever a new product is in its introduction stage, it would logically attract a lot of attention from security researchers trying to a make a point that it's vulnerable, and that some of the vulnerabilities are pretty trivial. For instance, yesterday David Maynor from Errata Security pin pointed possibilities for exploitation in Google's Chrome, saying that :
“Google just released Chrome, their own web browser. We decided to run it through Looking Glass and it doesn't look half bad. They at least have ASLR enabled on a few of their libraries, no NX though. Chrome is not as bad as some apps I have seen but that is not saying much.”
What's important though, is whether or not the browser release would also start attracting the attention of cybercriminals. Being anything but old-fashioned, they too do their homework and take into consideration the market share of a particular browser in order to increase the impact of exploiting it. Consequently, for the time being the level of exploitability of Google's Chrome is right after Opera's from the perspective of the malicious attacker taking into consideration Chrome's non-existent market share.
Would the level of exploitability change? In the fist quarter of 2009, Google would presumably release stats of the number of people who downloaded Chrome, demonstrating nothing else but the introduction stage of their browser. The question is, how many of those who downloaded it would actually stick with it, and would companies embrace it if it does get popular enough, potentially increasing the exploitability level of any upcoming vulnerabilities?
Considering the fact that according to public statistics of usage share of web browsers, IE6 users are just as many as IE7 ones, converting from Firefox or IE to Google's Chrome is not going to happen overnight.

I guess Thursday midnight is technically Friday morning, unless midnight is defined as 00:00-ε or something, but anyway, the Official SpyParty Late Night Streamer™ drawnonward is celebrating his 100th stream on Thursday night at midnight, Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8), which means it's Friday at 8am GMT (I think, unless I messed that math up), on his twitch.tv channel:
http://www.twitch.tv/drawnonward
It should be fun and rather silly…he posted in the beta forums asking for ideas and people are gifting him random Steam stuff to give away to people in stream chat, he's going to dress up as one of the current SpyParty characters (he's not telling which one!), and I'll be joining him from midnight to 1am to play on his stream. Sadly, my internet this week is kind of slow and terrible, so I don't think I can stream the other side on the SpyParty channel, but I should be able to join him via voice chat. My personal dream is that he'll actually start using a non-default icon/image for his channel by then.
Come along, hang out in the stream chat, and it should be a good time. The big question is whether I'll have this build done and tested before then. Maybe you can watch a brand-new build fail spectacularly, live, while I curse over TeamSpeak!
PS. I think I have figured out who is killing my robots, so Part 3 of the Loadtesting for Open Beta series will be posted soon!
A new report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has claimed that the United Kingdom could face “an extra two years of austerity measures” as a result of a British exit from the European Union (EU) was funded by an organisation that tried to cover up its European Union funding, Breitbart London can reveal.
The report, which claims “borrowing in 2019-20 would need to be £20 billion-40 billion more than currently planned… [which] would mean two more years' austerity, was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) which has received nearly a quarter of a million pounds in EU funding since 2009.
A Breitbart London enquiry filed in February 2016 asked the government body: “how much the ESRC has received in funding, grants, from the european institutions since january 2006″.
An initial response from the ESRC declared “Further to your enquiry I can confirm that ESRC don't receive grants we only allocate them.
“ESRC is a non-departmental public body (NDPB) and receives most of its funding through the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).”
But buried in organisation's annual report was the admission that the group had take EU funding, which was quickly pointed out to them. The response followed:
“Further to my last email, I apologise as I misunderstood the question and therefore provided you with an incorrect answer.”
Subsequent Freedom of Information response revealed that the ESRC was “unable” to provide full details since 2006, instead declaring that since 2009, the organisation has received £241,006.83 from the European Commission.
The response in full said:
If you go to B.C. New Democratic Party leader Adrian Dix's biography online at Wikipedia, you will find that he is married to a poet, has Type 1 diabetes, is fluently bilingual and served as Glen Clark's chief of staff when Clark was the NDP premier.
What you won't find on the ubiquitous user-edited digital encyclopedia is any reference to Dix's darkest days or his biggest admitted mistake, when he falsified a memo in an effort to protect Clark from allegations of conflict of interest. Or that he was fired for it, or that the memo-writing affair was part of the casino scandal that led to Clark's resignation and paved the way for the Liberal election sweep of 2001.
It isn't for lack of trying by a number of Wikipedia users, who have been adding those facts and others to Dix's online biography, even if some of those additions are coloured with political invective.
But, for at least the past two years, ever since he became the NDP leader, Dix's biography has been carefully stage-managed by an anonymous group of people who cleanse any negative comment, even if it was cited by credible sources or has been accepted by Dix himself.
In recent days, as the province gets ready for the May 14 provincial election, the digital fight over Dix's personal history reached a climax. Since April 6, details of the “memo to file” incident have been re-inserted at least 10 times, and just as quickly removed. On Tuesday morning, a Wikipedia editor with powers to lock the page did so, leaving online a cleansed version that omits any negative bits of Dix's history.
For the leader of the opposition that has stopped — at least temporarily — the problem of subjective editing that has befallen many politicians and celebrities.
Premier Christy Clark isn't immune from this. Her Wiki page has had personal and sexist comments added, capitalizing in part on recent stories about her reaction to comments about her looks.
Unlike Dix's page, there have been no efforts to remove a number of negative references, including her close connections in the BC Rail scandal. The biography of Conservative leader John Cummins hasn't been tinkered with and all three party pages at Wikiedia are not subject to the same level of attention as Dix's biography
In the past 90 days, Dix's online history has been read at least 20,000 times, according to Wikipedia. Christy Clark's biography was viewed nearly 60,000 times in the same period.
Both the NDP and the Liberals say they are not behind the constant editing of Dix's Wiki biography. Many of those adding in the “memo to file” information are newly-registered users or are hidden through Internet Protocol addresses that can't be easily traced. The Sun was unable to contact any of the people making changes on either side.
On Tuesday, Dix made light of the affair, saying he doesn't pay attention to his Wikipedia entry, but noted a recent Sun story citing his birth date used incorrect information that clearly came from Wikipedia. (His birthday is April 20, 1964, not April 26.)

This week on CounterSpin: You wouldn't know it from corporate press, but what may have been the largest prison labor strike in the country's history happened September 9, after months of organizing. Prisoners hoped to call attention to a range of complaints about conditions, including forced labor. This country is supposedly taking a bipartisan “fresh look” at mass incarceration; so what does elite media's collective yawn say about their actual interest in what happens to people once they are behind bars?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are assisting state and local officials in assessing the risk of hepatitis A virus exposure from contaminated frozen tuna sourced from Sustainable Seafood Company, Vietnam, and Santa Cruz Seafood Inc., Philippines. If unvaccinated consumers have consumed the recalled product within the last two weeks, post-exposure prophylaxis may help prevent hepatitis A virus infection.
Update Prior to FDA's announcement, Hilo Fish Company alerted its customers and distribution partners directly to let them know about the company's voluntary recall of certain tuna products on May 18. The FDA received records from the company or its distribution partners indicating that they sold frozen tuna to the establishments listed on the FDA's website. The FDA is working with Hilo and other distributors to ensure that the companies remove product from the market. The table containing the names of establishments have been updated. It is the responsibility of the Hilo Fish Company to notify its customers about the voluntary recall. It is also the responsibility of any company that received a recall notice from Hilo Fish Company to notify its customers. The establishments identified on the FDA's website should have received a notice from Hilo Fish Company or their direct supplier. If they have not, they should reach out to their suppliers for more information. Any company that has questions about the voluntary recall or has affected product and did not receive notice should contact the FDA at 1-800-SAFEFOOD.
Fast Facts
On May 18, Hilo Fish Company began recalling tuna sourced from Sustainable Seafood Company and Santa Cruz Seafood, Inc. that tested positive for the hepatitis A virus.
While the CDC is not currently aware of any illnesses linked to these products, it is advising post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated persons who may have consumed the potentially contaminated tuna within the past two weeks.
The FDA is providing a list of establishments in TX, OK, and CA that may currently have potentially contaminated tuna in commerce to help alert consumers that may be at risk of the hepatitis A virus. Contact your health care professional if you believe you have been exposed to contaminated tuna.
The current recall resulted from follow-up after the Hawaii Department of Health notified the FDA of a frozen tuna sample, sourced from PT Deho Canning Co.,which tested positive for hepatitis A on May 1, 2017. The initially recalled product has been removed from circulation and the newly recalled frozen tuna lots were not shipped to Hawaii, but were shipped to the mainland U.S.

What was the Problem and What was Done About It?
Consumers may be at risk of contracting a hepatitis A infection due to the consumption of potentially contaminated frozen tuna distributed by Hilo Fish Company and sourced from Sustainable Seafood Company (Lots F5-6 Soui Dau Industrial Zone, Can Lam Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam) and Santa Cruz Seafood, Inc. (General Santos Fishport Complex Tambler, General Santos City, 9500, Philippines). The CDC reports no illnesses to date.
The FDA is collecting additional frozen tuna samples and increasing its screening measures and testing for imported seafood for these companies.
In addition, the agency has prepared a list of restaurants and other retail locations that received the recalled frozen tuna. The agency will continue to update this list as its investigation continues. To protect the health of consumers who may have eaten contaminated tuna and require post-exposure prophylaxis, the FDA has determined that it is necessary to make public the names of these businesses as part of the recall.
Background
On May 1, the Hawaii Department of Health notified the FDA that a sample of frozen tuna cubes from Indonesia tested positive for the hepatitis A virus. On May 2, the FDA contacted the Tropic Fish Hawaii LLC, a subsidiary distributor of Hilo Fish Company, to obtain additional information related to the positive tuna sample. Tropic Fish Hawaii LLC initiated a product recall because the affected product had been distributed to its customers in Oahu, Hawaii (U.S. mainland and other Hawaiian Islands were not affected by the recall). The state of Hawaii embargoed the lot that tested positive and the FDA confirmed the sample was positive.
On May 16, Hilo Fish Company notified the FDA that it had submitted samples of additional shipments held in its cold storage facility in Hawaii to a private laboratory for testing and received additional positive results for the hepatitis A virus. Imported tuna products from this facility were sourced from Sustainable Seafood Company and Santa Cruz Seafood and were distributed to restaurants and other retail locations in CA, NY, OK, and TX. The New York State Department of Health and the FDA verified that product shipped to New York was not sold to the public. The FDA's investigation in connection with these firms is ongoing.

What is Hepatitis A?
Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis A virus . It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. Hepatitis A can be spread when a person ingests the virus from contaminated food or water. The virus can also be easily passed from an infected person to other unvaccinated family members, sexual partners, and close contacts.
What are the Symptoms of Hepatitis A?
Symptoms in adults include fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, abnormal liver tests, dark urine, and pale stool. People with hepatitis A may not have symptoms until 15 to 50 days after consuming a contaminated food or drink. CDC reports that while the hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children, vaccination rates are lower than for other recommended childhood vaccines. Unvaccinated children can become ill and not have symptoms.
Who is at Risk?
Any unvaccinated person who consumed recalled frozen tuna is at risk of contracting the hepatitis A virus.
back to top
What Can be Done to Prevent Infection with Hepatitis A?
CDC recommends providing post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have eaten any of the recalled raw or undercooked tuna products in the last two weeks. People who have consumed this fish fully cooked are at reduced risk of exposure, but we encourage consultation with medical professionals.
PEP consists of:
Hepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years
Hepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range, but the hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted if IG is not available.
Those with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP
If you are unsure if you have been vaccinated against hepatitis A virus, contact your health professional to check your immunization records. If you have been vaccinated, no further action is needed. If you have never received the hepatitis A vaccine, getting a single dose within two weeks of exposure can protect against illness. If you are unable to determine whether you have already been vaccinated, receiving an additional dose of vaccine is not harmful.

What Specific Products Were Recalled?
The first recall, which took place in Hawaii, consisted of imported raw frozen ahi tuna cubes sourced from PT Deho Canning Co. (JL. Raya Madidir, Bitung, Indonesia). That recall by Tropic Fish includes lot codes 609149 and 609187. No products are believed to remain on the market.
The current recall, which began May 18, consists of frozen yellowfin tuna steaks from Sustainable Seafood Company and yellowfin tuna cubes from Santa Cruz Seafood. This recall by Hilo Fish Company includes Tuna Steaks, 8 oz. individually vacuum packed bags, production date code: 627152, Lot number: 166623; Expiration date: 2018-10-01 and Frozen Yellowfin tuna cubes, random; Individually vacuum packed; 15 lb. case, date code: 705342, Lot number: 173448; Expiration dates: 2019-04-01).
The FDA continues to update the list of establishments that are associated with this recall.
This list includes firms that have received the recalled tuna product. Consumers may wish to ask a firm directly if they had made the recalled product available for sale.

FDA has confirmed with new information that some establishments previously listed did not receive the recalled product. Those establishments have been removed.
What Do Restaurants and Retailers Need To Do?
Prior to FDA's announcement, Hilo Fish Company alerted its customers and distribution partners directly to let them know about the company's voluntary recall of certain tuna products on May 18. The FDA received records from the company or its distribution partners indicating that they sold frozen tuna to the establishments listed on the FDA's website. The FDA is working with Hilo and other distributors to ensure that the companies remove product from the market.
It is the responsibility of the Hilo Fish Company to notify its customers about the voluntary recall. It is also the responsibility of any company that received a recall notice from Hilo Fish Company to notify its customers. The establishments identified on the FDA's website should have received a notice from Hilo Fish Company or their direct supplier. If they have not, they should reach out to their suppliers for more information. Any company that has questions about the voluntary recall or has affected product and did not receive notice should contact the FDA at 1-800-SAFEFOOD.
Affected restaurants and other retail locations should take appropriate actions to ensure that recalled product is not served to consumers. If any businesses find they served any recalled product within the last two weeks, they should contact their local health department and wherever possible, notify their consumers about possible exposure to hepatitis A virus and the potential benefit of post exposure prophylaxis.
In the event that retailers and/or other retail locations are found to have handled recalled or other potentially contaminated food in their facilities, they should:
Wash and sanitize display cases and refrigerators where potentially contaminated products were stored.
Wash and sanitize cutting boards, surfaces, and utensils used to prepare, serve, or store potentially contaminated products.
Wash hands with hot water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.
Retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any potentially contaminated products need to be concerned about cross contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products.
back to top
What Do Consumers Need To Do?
If you think you've gotten sick from eating recalled tuna contact your health care professional. The FDA and CDC are not currently aware of any illnesses related to any recalled frozen tuna. However, because hepatitis A can have serious health consequences, CDC advises post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated persons who have consumed any of the recalled frozen tuna products in the past two weeks. PEP offers no preventive benefit to persons whose exposure occurred more than 2 weeks ago. People who have consumed this fish fully cooked are at reduced risk of exposure, but are encouraged to consult with their medical professionals.
Contaminated shellfish, fruit (berries), and salads are the most frequent foodborne sources of hepatitis A. Hepatitis A can be transmitted from person to person. Consumers should always practice safe food handling and preparation measures. Wash hands, utensils, and surfaces with hot, soapy water before and after handling food. Consumers should thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom and changing diapers to help protect themselves from hepatitis A, as well as other foodborne diseases.
Who Should be Contacted?
Contact your healthcare professional if you think you may have become ill from eating tuna, or if you believe that you have eaten any of the recalled frozen tuna within the last two weeks.
The FDA encourages consumers with questions about food safety to call 1-888-SAFEFOOD Monday through Friday between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern time, or to consult http://www.fda.gov.

New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Monday blamed the Election Commission for "EVM-tampering fraud" and said the poll panel's only aim was to bring the BJP to power at any cost.
Kejriwal, who is also Chief Minister of Delhi, said 18 Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) had surfaced in Dholpur in Rajasthan which voted only for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) no matter which button was pressed by the voters.
The Dholpur by-election was held on Sunday.
"Eighteen EVMs in one constituency means at least 10 percent of the total number of machines were tampered with," Kejriwal said, adding that doubts also arose about the other 90 percent machines.
"The Election Commission is still not ready to probe the issue of EVM tampering despite all the evidence. This raises suspicion if the tampering is being done on its directions," Kejriwal said.
He also referred to an earlier allegedly tampered EVM in Bhind in Madhya Pradesh.
The AAP leader said the machines were not malfunctioning as claimed by the Election Commission but were actually tampered with.
"If there was some defect, then some machines would have voted for the Congress, some for the AAP and some for BJP. But why are all defective machines voting only for the BJP? It means this is not a malfunction but the software of these machines have been tampered with or has been completely changed," he said.
He asked why elections were being held at all and said the commission should simply declare BJP as winner in every election.
"The Election Commission is no more interested in conducting elections in a free and fair manner. It seems now that their only objective is to bring the BJP in power at any cost," he added.
Kejriwal held that all EVMs for the Delhi municipal polls — to be held on 23 April — were being brought from Rajasthan although a large number of EVMs were available in Delhi as well. "All EVMs in Rajasthan are manipulated. That is why they want elections using those machines," he further alleged.
Kejriwal had earlier demanded the use of paper ballot in Delhi's civic polls to ensure transparency — even if the election needed to be postponed because of this.

Town are delighted to have secured the services of midfielder James Bailey.
The former Derby County man, who can also play right-back, has signed a two-year deal at Huish Park.
Bailey came through Crewe Alexandra's prestigious Academy and made 55 first-team appearances before transferring to the Rams in 2010.
He spent four years at Pride Park and following two successful loan spells with Coventry City, moved to Barnsley ahead of the 2014/15 campaign.
The experienced 28-year-old featured 29 times for the Tykes but after a solitary year at Oakwell opted for a new challenge in India with Pune City.
During his time in Asia, Bailey played against world stars such as Nicolas Anelka, Florent Malouda, Simao and Helder Postiga.
He then sampled life at Canadian outfit Ottawa Fury before returning to England to sign for Carlisle United on a short-term deal until the end of the 2016/17 campaign.
Bailey helped the Cumbrians reach the Sky Bet League Two play-offs, featuring in both legs, and was offered a new contract but has chosen to move on to pastures new with Yeovil.
“I want to thank everyone for their involvement in this signing,” boss Darren Way told YTFC.net.
“The midfield jigsaw is now complete and we have a few finishing touches to make elsewhere.
“I've been chasing James all summer and negotiations have been going on since the season finished, so to get him signed on and committed to the green and white cause is fantastic for the football club.”
Would you like to sponsor James this season? Please contact Commercial Manager Dave Linney on 01935 847872 or email DLinney@ytfc.net.
There's nothing much more alluring than a headline touting the health benefits of chocolate – and if they have to do with protecting the brain, most of us are sold. There's been a lot of research in this area, with some studies strongly suggesting that compounds in cocoa may reduce the risk for age-related cognitive decline, or, possibly, even reverse it once it occurs. The problem is that no one can quite pin down why it might be good for the brain, though certain mechanisms are good candidates. Now, a new study in Neurology goes a little further in teasing apart the mechanisms that may be involved in the chocolate-brain relationship. And though the researchers aren't recommending we all increase our cocoa consumption just yet, there do appear to be certain compounds in cocoa that are worth paying attention to.
ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT
In the new study, the team from Harvard randomly assigned 60 elderly people to drink two cups of flavanol-rich or flavanol-poor cocoa every day for a month. Flavanols are a type of polyphenol – antioxidants found in foods like cocoa, tea, berries, and wine. Foods rich in these compounds have been shown to benefit heart and brain health in the past. The problem with many earlier studies is that they've asked people to recall their intake of the various foods over the years, which can be unreliable, rather than randomly assigning them to eat specific foods in the present.
The participants were tested for memory and thinking skills before and after the cocoa intervention, and given a form of ultrasound that measures blood flow in the brain. There weren't any overall differences between the high- and low-flavanol groups in terms of cognitive abilities, so the researchers looked a little deeper. They found that people who had compromised blood flow to the brain and white matter damage at the beginning of the study did show a difference after drinking the cocoa for a month: Blood flow in their brains improved by about 8%, and the time it took them to complete a working memory test dropped from 167 seconds to 116 seconds.
These results are nothing if not enticing, and they do support earlier evidence that cocoa's benefits may stem from its capacity to improve blood flow to the brain, which uses a whopping 20% of the body's energy, while only accounting for 2% of its weight. In other words, the brain is quite a needy organ, energetically speaking, so any improvement in blood flow could be reflected in cognition.
"We're learning more about blood flow in the brain and its effect on thinking skills," study author Farzaneh A. Sorond tells me. "As different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer's."
The problem is that not only do we not know exactly how cocoa does this, but we don't really even know what compound in it is responsible. “How cocoa results in improved neurovascular coupling, we don't know,” says Sorond. “We also don't know what it is in cocoa that is beneficial; is it the flavanols, the caffeine, the theobromine? In our study there was no difference between the flavanol poor and rich compounds in terms of benefit. Does this mean the flavanols are not important or does it mean that just a little bit of flavanol is enough?”
Sorond says that her hunch, based on the literature, is that it is the antioxidants – the flavanols – that are responsible. “But this has yet to be confirmed,” she adds.
It's important to point out that the big caveat in the study is that only people with compromised blood flow showed improvement, so it's too early to recommend chocolate as a therapeutic tool to prevent or reverse cognitive decline, or to stock up on it before a big presentation or exam. The “bad” things in chocolate may effectively counteract the good ones. “I do not recommend that people add chocolate or cocoa to their diet at this point,” says Sorond. “Our results are preliminary and adding the extra calories, sugar and fat that comes with chocolate and cocoa carries additional health hazards which may offset any possible brain benefits.”

That said, an editorial in the same journal is a little more hopeful. While the authors don't think cocoa's effects have to do with the flavanols, they do say that in the future, “regular cocoa consumption may be a strategy to minimize (perhaps even reverse) cerebral vascular pathology in neurodegenerative disorders, regardless of its flavanol content.”
We'll keep watching as the cocoa studies roll in. Though there are many other places to get your flavanols, it's likely that a little dark chocolate every now and then is not such a bad thing, and may actually be a very good one.

Audio Technica have quite the habit of releasing “Limited Editions” down through the years with some hit and misses and some retaining value and others bombing. My last LTD review was the exquisite looking flagship W3000ANV in 2012. I remember at the time stating the W3000ANV had bags of emotion, a wonderful mid-range but sounding very unique indeed in the lineup of big name headphones around the same price mark. A lot of audiophiles might have bought purely on its looks, even more on the looks and the sound, but some will have seen it as a future investment given its limited edition status. As I check on the used value right now the W3000ANV is still holding its value relatively well at around $1200 or higher on some of the big forums. So whilst not the solid investment some might have hoped it still holds ‘major currency' among devoted audiophiles on the used market.
LTD Editions: The Wall Street Game
A few rungs down though and the limited edition ethos of ATH is still being applied but this time to their mid-range headphones and in particular the ATH-A900X LTD. The LTD version was just launched this year and sells at a local SRP of Php23,999.00 (Philippines). A quick scan of the international markets and the price does vary quite a bit from region to region with Australia retailing from $349AU to $405AU, the UK at £389 and the US as low as $390 (plus taxes). Now as I checked Amazon most retailers are actually shipping direct out of Japan (Marketplace) and the price merely starts at $389 with some relatively new sellers in the Marketplace but it can shoot right up to nearly $600 not including delivery or taxes. That is quite a variation in pricing and since stocks are usually limited (hence the name right?) the likelihood of pricing becoming even more volatile in the coming months and years will only increase. My advice is if you are getting it then get it now and buy it local or buy it used before it disappears from retail altogether. You never know it could be a solid investment in years to come but if you import on a whim then replacement parts might be hard to come by later on as stocks dwindle. This limited edition version is not the exact same as the ATH-900X painted red guys so you have been warned.
Build and fit Impressions
Once the wallet is emptied though the ATH-A900X LTD is a familiar yet impressive looking full sized closed headphone out of the box. I say familiar because it still follows the classic Audio Technica full sized headphone form factor and design lines but with an added dash of panache in the form of cherry colored anodized aluminum ear cup plates with some gold accenting on the edge of the cups. The original A900X, though having basically the same design as the LTD edition, came in a plainer all black without the Limited Edition decal. Some will love the red, others might prefer the black. I seemed to remember having that same discussion on the MrSpeakers Alpha Dogs red or black edition a while ago with some local forum members. Opinion was, and still is, a bit divided on the preferred color.
The form factor is all Audio Technica with the patented “3D wing support” headband system that they also use on their regular Air Monitor range as well as the higher end W-series models. It also sports dual entry cups with a non detachable 6N 3m cable terminated with a 3.5mm jack and a detachable quarter jack adapter. Inside the cups ATH have also reworked the voice coils in an effort to enhance the level of clarity and produce a more natural sound over the stock A900X. The plether ear pads, which are slightly stiffer than the older A900 version, remain in place making them identical to the current A900X pads. As with the W3000ANV and the stock A900X the 3D wing system of late seems to be more visual than outright functionality. The balance is there but the grip is not that tight meaning the support pressure is more on your ears and side of the head around your ears than on the top of your head.
Thankfully the A900X LTD is a not a super heavy full size closed headphone weighing in at 330g (half the weight of an LCD-XC) so the pressure on the ears was not something I would get too bothered about. It actually remained pretty steady on my head even with rapid movement. However head shapes and sizes vary so I would check this out beforehand to see if they sit well or slide too much down. Since it is the same basically in design as the A900X stock you can try that out in your local audio store before ordering a limited edition. Whatever your fitting experience is on the A900X it should be the exact same as on the limited edition version.
Isolation was darn near perfect in terms of noise kept out and noise kept in. Background noise was really negligible during audio playback and as a spectator with others trying out the A900X LTD I did not hear a single note escape from the cups. This is one of the best passive isolating headphones that I have tried to date. Wear this on a commute or in the office with confidence. You might get stared down for the “Cyberman” look but they sure as heck will not have a clue what you are listening to.
Note also the limited edition comes in a flashier matching red colored box but it is not a huge upgrade on the original A900X Art Monitor type box. It is still a cardboard box and like the ESW11LTD I would love Audio Technica to fully embrace the Limited Edition love fest and roll out a metal, wood or stiffened leather box just to make you feel your getting something a bit ‘more' special for your money. It's a minor quibble I guess but some do look for value-add in the packaging when it comes to limited editions.

deweller: deweller: Do any of you have any ideas about how to grow our contributing developer community and how to spur our developer community into action? It seems to me that we have people who are willing to contribute. But we need something to help the developers work toward completing meaningful project milestones. I think the foundation might be able to help in a meaningful way here, but I'm not sure how. Do any of you have any ideas?
In January 2015 at TNABC Miami, I had an engaged and detailed conversation with Eric Larchevêque (Founder of Ledger - hardware wallets) about Counterparty. I explained to him the benefits of Counterparty and the enthusiasm of the community behind it.
A large portion of our discussion was about the possibility of them making their wallet become Counterparty aware. I walked away feeling confident that this was something that might actually happen. As we now know, the “Ledger Nano S” is now Counterparty compatible.
That same week I had a very similar conversation with Paul Puey of Airbitz. He seemed receptive and it appears from their developer site that there has been movement in the direction of supporting meta-tokens like Counterparty. A recent quote from Paul to me: “We have a significant refactor of our wallet this year that would make it much easier to make it counterparty aware.” Paul further stated: “Any dev on counterparty however would probably need to happen from a 3rd party.” “We're happy to start talking to counterparty devs to show the new architecture and get feedback. If there is any interest.”
I see this as a good thing to move the ball forward.
Numerous times I spoke with Alena Vranova (@AlenaSatoshi) of Satoshi Labs and other members of the team about Counterparty integration and the request was always well received.
There is no way to know whether the actions of these example companies were directly attributable to my efforts but I'm okay if it was just part of the accumulative effect of hearing this request from multiple people in the Bitcoin community.
There are ideas that I have that would incentivize developers to take on various projects with a clear Scope of Work. This would require that the Foundation drive and manage this plan along with the community consensus regarding which projects are a priority. It would require that the community agreed that it would benefit the Counterparty platform by increasing developer achievements. My ideas may or may not require a CIP, but the details are outside the scope of a brief answer in the AMA.
longtime_cp_follower: longtime_cp_follower: What do you like about the counterparty platform?
I love the DEX. I was originally attracted to the fact that Counterparty did a proof of burn rather than a money raise. That made a big statement to me.
I like the fact that an asset owner can make their own business plan and business rules. It reminds me of when anyone could have their own domain name and build out their vision of a website. Some have great value and others go straight to the potato.
Assets will be the same way. We have barely gotten out of the starting gate - the innovations that we will soon see will astound many of us ‘longtime Counterparty people'.
Several years into the Web I thought that I had seen it all - now I am constantly surprised and amazed by what people do with the Web that we hadn't even considered in the early days.
I look forward to seeing that same explosive innovation in our space.
longtime_cp_follower: longtime_cp_follower: What are your thoughts on how to best grow the community in the coming year? How would you contribute to that effort?
I have been putting effort into growing the community for a few years now. I know it has been effective based on the feedback from the attendees of the 150+ weekly Bitcoin Meetups I have co-hosted.
I have also been educating members of the domain investor community which we have much in common with. Many of them have become very involved with Counterparty assets and these are the types of people who look to find ways to actually build things out.
I expect to continue and expand my reach and dialogue moving forward.
longtime_cp_follower: longtime_cp_follower: Should Counterparty move to another blockchain for faster transactions and cheaper fees? When?
We would all ideally like to see faster transactions and cheaper fees including Bitcoin users that never use Counterparty.
I'm confident that these hurdles will be overcome either by some of the solutions that are currently proposed. It wouldn't surprise me if another solution presents itself that is not currently being considered.
In my opinion, moving Counterparty to an alt-coin could be a big mistake. No other blockchain has the security of Bitcoin.
If Counterparty assets were to become utilized in such a way that each token of an asset represented something of great value (imagine a token being paired with a diamond or something similar), it is conceivable that the value held in Counterparty assets could dwarf the entire market-cap of bitcoin itself.
While the energy burned today is adequate to make the value of Bitcoin secure it is an open question as to what happens once we make the network hold an unexpected extreme additional value.
Even with Counterparty on the most secure blockchain (Bitcoin) there are those potential future concerns. Moving Counterparty to any other blockchain that is far less secure is a scary thought and could make the platform unusable for assets and tokens carrying great value in the future.
longtime_cp_follower: longtime_cp_follower: Do you think the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) should be enabled on counterparty? Why?
I believe that the EVM introduces potential attack vectors that we don't currently need to worry about. If we had our own DAO style incident it could cause many unintended consequences and potential liabilities for our platform.
I believe we have attributes that can be celebrated that Ethereum does not. There are so many additional value-added features that we can build into Counterparty. I don't think we need to be a different flavor of Ethereum.
Kata. It's a wonderful practice that gives us a scientific method for hitting our goals and building a robust lean culture. Yet LEI faculty Beth Carrington has seen too many leaders make a critical mistake that can undermine their Kata efforts at the roots. Today she shares that mistake and how we can avoid it.
Let's start from the ground up. What is the role of coaching in Kata?
The idea of the Coaching Kata is to help embed a very specific and desired way of thinking and acting that a Learner habitualizes through frequent, intentional and course corrected practice. The desired ways of thinking and acting are built on the scientific method, where a learner experiments to learn how to recognize and overcome obstacles on their way to achieving goals beyond their threshold of knowledge. This scientific approach builds an innovative approach to achieving goals as opposed to an implementation approach. Think of doing quick-cycle PDCA: laying out an experiment, then comparing our prediction with what actually happened and then learning from that moment before continuing on with a next PDCA cycle.
So the role of the Coaching Kata is to teach this scientific approach through structured - short but frequent - coaching sessions. The Coaching Kata teaches the thought pattern (mental model) where a learner experiments to learn how to recognize and overcome obstacles on their way to achieving goals beyond their threshold of knowledge. The Coaching Kata is structured sessions between a Coach and a Learner that follows a very defined pattern, repeated frequently (as close to daily as possible) and gives the Coach an opportunity to give course correction feedback to their Learner.
We practice both the Coaching Kata and Improvement Kata during our two or three-day courses, to expose people to these routines to build their awareness and through Master Coach practice we prepare them for their own intentional or deliberate practice in their organizations.
Think of doing quick-cycle PDCA: laying out an experiment, then comparing our hypothesis with what actually happened and then learning from that moment before continuing on with the cycle.
So it stands to good reason that many managers out there want to Kata coach their own direct reports right away. But is there a pitfall in them doing that?
Oh yes. The common flaw in that rush to coach is that many managers will just jump in, believing they can teach this routine without themselves first making Kata a habit or learning the methodology behind it. When a manager takes the time to learn and habitualize Kata, they create what I would refer to as a mental construct, about what the improvement Kata actually looks and feels like so construct they can internalize it themselves. Then when they do the one-two-three of coaching, they will have a mental construct to compare their learners' behaviors against.
Kata isn't exactly something you can just dive headfirst into. Why do so many managers think they can do Kata without learning and practicing first?
One, it's probably how they have been managed, and when we first enter the workplace. Every manager tends to manage a little bit differently and what we might do is pick and choose the behaviors we like and hopefully incorporate those into our own behavior. So as we become managers we're doing it - at least the way we thought an effective manager does it. And that's a disaster waiting to happen.
For example, last week I was with an organization going through this exact scenario; they have three thousand managers, and they're of all sorts, all levels. That means they currently have three thousand different coaching routines going on.
What they desire is to have one routine, what they have made is a very concerted effort to create what we would call a Meta Habit. A Meta Habit is a routine that can be used against any content. Any kind of process, any level in the organization, it's one routine to fit all. Unless the organization launches one consistent, concerted effort to build its own Kata or its own structured routine, they are going to have three thousand ways of coaching people, and it's hard to develop anyone that way. The idea of the Coaching Kata at its core is the idea of having one routinized approach to developing capabilities; to think scientifically; to act scientifically.
So what's the remedy? What's the best way for a manager to properly learn Kata so he or she can use it on others?
The first thing is to do it; it's to practice the routine - whatever routine you are trying to develop skills in - you have to practice it. There are some key aspects of that practice. The practice needs to be deliberate or intentional, meaning you have to actually be in the moment and think about the behavior that you are practicing. Sometimes I think it's an ignition – you have to want to do it and you have to be present in it to begin to actually habitualize yourself. You need to be deliberate in your practice; you need to practice it perfectly, which means you have to follow the routine very specifically and you should practice it frequently. These three elements are part of what the manager has to do; practice the Improvement Kata deliberately, perfectly and frequently. Hopefully, they practice under their own coach's guidance so they're getting the corrective feedback they need to make their practice perfect.
And I also like to remind Kata coaches-in-training that the frequency of practice sessions is more important than the duration. When we begin to work with organizations embedding coaching Kata, we're talking coaching sessions that take just fifteen minutes, but they're done every day; or at least as close to every day as possible. Neural science tells us that very frequent, short bursts of learning, are better than one long learning session.
FC Dallas reserves tops Rapids 1-0
Bryan Leyva nets game-winner in the 84th minute
COMMERCE CITY, Colo. (Tuesday, March 20, 2012) – FC Dallas Reserves collected its second win of the season with a 1-0 victory over the Colorado Rapids Reserves today at Dick's Sporting Goods Park. Homegrown player Bryan Leyva scored the only goal of the game late in the match, dribbling past a Rapids defender before firing a shot to the far post from 15 yards out.
The Rapids and FC Dallas split possession evenly in the first half, with each side having a handful of chances before entering halftime deadlocked at 0-0. Dallas had an early chance in the second half, when Leyva received a pass from Moises Hernandez at the top of the six-yard box in the 48th minute. Unfortunately for Leyva, his attempt went just wide of the post.
Colorado had several chances late in the game. Its best opportunity came in the 77th minute when Steven Emory's shot was cleared out for a corner kick by Hernandez. Colorado's Dillon Serna also had a shot cleared away from a dangerous spot before Leyva scored for Dallas.
FC Dallas Reserves improve to 2-0-0 with the victory, while the Rapids Reserves fall to 0-2-0. The FC Dallas Reserves next face the Houston Dynamo Reserves on Tuesday, April 10 at FC Dallas Stadium.

For well over half a decade, Hollywood has been trying to bring Neill Strauss‘ “The Game,” his skeezy exposé about the world of pickup artists, to the big screen. Early on, “The Office” writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky were hired to tackle the script, and back in 2012 James Franco and Josh Gad became attached to star, with directing pair Brian Koppelman and David Levein at the helm. This is all a long way to say, that version never happened, and things went quiet, but the movie is still happening.

Deadline reports that Franco is back on to star and produce “The Game,” with everything now moving towards shooting in 2017. No word on who had their hand on the latest draft of the script, and the hunt is on for a director and cast to make this happen.
However, Franco is still lined up to play Mystery, the man who knows all the secrets to winning women, which includes “negging” (gross). With the book already earning its fair share of controversy, no doubt the movie should do the same.
The United Nations World Food Programme will soon distribute Mastercard prepaid debit cards, each loaded with $27, to Syrian refugees in Lebanon so they can buy their own food and boost the local economy.
The cards will be reloaded each month with a fresh $27, an amount the World Food Programme determined should be sufficient per person over that amount of time. That money means refugees won't have to wait in line for new paper vouchers every 30 days, and they will no longer be dependent on pre-packaged rations. Instead, they can buy produce at any of the 300 stores across Lebanon that have signed up to participate.
"They're just more independent that way," Bettina Luescher, World Food Programme's chief spokesperson for North America, told Mashable. "They can get what they would like for their families."
The cards also help tame fraud because they are much easier to track than paper voucher, according to Ann Cairns, Mastercard's president of international markets. When the UN distributes the cards, it also issues an ID that must be used in order to make a purchase with the card.
The goal is to get a card into the hands of each of the 800,000 UN-registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon by the end of the year.
"We know where they are, we know who they are," Luescher said. "It's not as complicated as it might sound."
The World Food Programme has already tested the e-cards with 10,000 people in Nabatiyeh, a Lebanese town. Based on that pilot, Luescher said they are ready to expand, and, if all goes well, they will start distributing cards to the 300,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan by the end of 2013.

AFTER weeks of speculation, Socceroos midfielder Luke Brattan's move to glamour club Manchester City has been confirmed.
Fox Sports News on Monday night exclusively revealed the news, with the former Brisbane Roar playmaker linking with the EPL ladder-leaders on a four-year deal.
It had been widely speculated that Brattan was being looked at by the City Group in a clever ploy to bring him back to the A-League for the Australian club in their stable, Melbourne City.
However, the Fox Sports News report revealed Brattan would instead be loaned out to Championship side Bolton.
The deal was confirmed just weeks after Brattan revealed during Socceroos camp in Jordan how he had been scouted while playing for the Roar in Melbourne.

“There was someone watching a game in Melbourne, when I played for Brisbane obviously against Melbourne (City),” Brattan told Fox Sports News at the time.
“I must have had a good game and it sort of developed from there.”
After cutting ties with the Roar, Brattan took the opportunity to train at Manchester City's world class academy, and it has clearly worked out for him with a dream move to Europe now sealed.
“It's amazing, I never thought say five years ago that I'd be in the spot that I'm in now,” Brattan said.
“I'm grateful for it and I won't take anything for granted.”
Madden is synonymous with video game football and has been for nearly 30 years. The vaunted franchise has had its ups and downs, but the current Madden NFL 16 on PS4 and Xbox One is the best and most expansive version yet. You can play on your own or battle friends at home and online; you can take the field with real teams and players performing according to their up-to-the-minute real-world ratings, or build fantasy squads laden with legends from the past and potential heroes from the future.
One thing you can't do? Play an NFL game made by anyone else.

A decade ago, Electronic Arts — the publisher of the Madden series — secured the exclusive rights to produce NFL and NFLPA-licensed video games on consoles. This meant the death of several other franchises, including the beloved NFL 2K series from rival publisher Take-Two. EA has never disclosed the amount of money that it cost to become the exclusive maker of NFL games, but their contract continues to this day. It's not publically known when, or if, the contract will end. EA even has to be prodded to admit that it is still exclusive, but one thing has become abundantly clear: Madden will never have a competitor again.
MORE: Madden NFL 16 improvements include graphics
There are several reasons for this. The first, and by far most important, is money. While it is not known exactly how much money EA pays the NFL and NFLPA for rights to the players, teams, and stadiums of the league, people in the know state that the Madden deal is believed to be the second-richest for the league after the TV money. So it's going to be north of $50 million per year just for the rights to this stuff. It takes pretty big guts to write a check for that kind of cash before you even start to put together a virtual gridiron.
In other words, expecting a traditionally risk-averse large video game publisher — the only kind of organization with the kinds of deep pockets needed in the game space — to be willing to to sink massive amounts of money into a large project against an established incumbent with no guarantee of success is not going to happen.
But, just for fun, let's assume someone solves the first problem. The second reason is that it has been so long since anyone else made anything resembling a simulation-style football game, the amount of time and people that it would take to put together something resembling a quality title is massive.
“It will take 3 years to make a AAA great football game,” former Madden Creative Director (and current Derby King designer) Ian Cummings told me in a recent Press Row Podcast. “Team size I think is usually inverse to how helpful it is. I think a team of 20 people for three years could absolutely compete with Madden, with all the new tech out there. Madden had to custom write lots of things, like how to render depth of field, how to add lighting effects or blooming effects, they had to custom write a lot of stuff that's just free on the internet now. That's the one advantage a new team would have.”
“If you keep it simple, you could have a AAA console football game shipped in 2-3 years,” said former Madden Assistant Producer (and current Social Gaming Network Project Manager) Jeremy Stein. “It would take a lot of people, even without building full, good game modes. We built a football simulator for Quick Hit Football in Unity and Flash and had about 25 people on staff. I'd think for a console game, you could make it happen with a staff in the 50-100 range.”

Why so long, though? Don't all of the new game development tools available today make things so much easier?
“Sort of,” Cummings said. “Madden is stuck in its old tech. The Unreals and Unitys of the world offer a huge advantage over what they're having to work with. Conversely, Madden has the huge, huge bonus of art assets and time. So let's say that tomorrow the NFL opened it up and somebody can start, they can really quickly get a football game up and running probably in a couple weeks.
"They can go try and license Backbreaker's tech from Natural Motion pretty quick — if they get that they've got a great physics engine absolutely competitive with Madden — but then it's just like, how do you scan 1,000 player heads? How do you go render 32 stadiums? How do you get all of the details right that Madden prides itself on? Every player's gear — sweatbands around his wrists and upper elbow — that's where I would think it would take an insanely long period of time and it would never add up. It's such a big game, there's so much in there.”
“There's so much to it,” Stein said. “Unity and Unreal would make developing an engine much easier, but not easy. EA has teams of genius, expensive graphics engineers developing just the graphics side of their engine. Cutting them out of the equation is something you couldn't do back in the day, but you could probably do now if you use Unreal. But just sticking on visuals you still need animators, and you need motion capture as source for the animations. Want grass on the field? Maybe you can buy textures, maybe you employ someone. You need multiple stadiums to play in, so someone has to build those, probably from scratch.”
MORE: Madden glitches are fun
Others argue that a non-licensed football game, featuring fake teams and stadiums, is the answer. Unfortunately, the buying public has spoken loudly and clearly with their wallets on that front. The last time anyone launched an American football simulation game on consoles — 2K Sports' All Pro Football 2K8 — it did not sell nearly well enough to justify a followup. We've not seen another one since. SImply put, fans want to see their favorite real teams and players in their actual stadiums, doing what they do.
And Electronic Arts is the only one who can do that anymore.
So the stakes to enter the NFL video game space, between licensing and paying people for 2-3 years to build it, is north of $150 million. Add to that the consideration that in 3 years, the current game console cycle will be nearing its end. Transitions to newer, more powerful machines will be happening, bringing with it lack of experience and uncertainty.
By 2019, it's entirely possible — likely, even — that Madden and other sports games will be available via EA-sponsored services much like Netflix or Spotify. Starting with a current-day business model but releasing into a very different, on-demand one, is a recipe for catastrophe. Even if that shift has not completely changed, there are red flags. With the retail cost of $60 per game, the debut title would need to sell at least 3 million copies to come close to breaking even, factoring in other costs such as marketing, manufacturing, and distributing the game. In an era when only the absolute top-selling titles come close to that number of copies sold, that is an incredibly large gamble.
“Madden can outmarket you, too,” says Cummings. “It doesn't matter how good your game is, they'll drop $50 million on an ad campaign and bury you.”
The good news is that Madden NFL 16, the latest version, is a strong title, with plenty of ways to enjoy it. The bad news is that sports fans love competition, and that just isn't going to ever happen again.

With the holidays coming up, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo will be battling to take the title of most purchased game console. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have lots of power and precision, but they have a target audience that is not as large as the Wii U target audience. This season people will be buying these new consoles for loved ones, but the amount of kids desperately searching for that special present is too big to overlook, with that perspective it becomes clear that the Wii U is ready to dominate sales this holiday season.
Gone are the times when families did not know that Nintendo had made anything since the Wii. Without proper clarification, those outside of the gaming world were mostly unaware of the hole Nintendo had been sinking in. Now, they have a game, or two rather, that easily illustrate the idea of a new console, those games being Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Mario Kart 8. Those that had the Wii know this Mario Kart is new because the one on the Wii was called Mario Kart Wii. Plus, the new Smash bros game has Wii U in the title.
Aside from the 3DS what really brought Nintendo back? The very thing that will continue to reel in the money, Mario Kart 8. Fortunately, the game is excellent as well as easy for any random individual to pick up and understand. The game already skyrocketed the sales of the Wii U when it launched but Nintendo has more in store; downloadable content. Two content packs were announced for Mario Kart 8, the first of which already released, the other is set to release sometime in Spring of 2015. Both additions lure players in with new characters, karts, and eight new tracks per content pack. The quality and quantity are extraordinary considering the two content packs can be bundled for only $11.99.
The Wii U was not selling well because it was still waiting for a few good games to really propel it forward and now that Nintendo has that they are tempting gamers with future possibilities. What future titles could be good enough to assure console owners and tempt those without? The next Zelda and Starfox game, both of which were described as coming out next year during The Game Awards 2014. However, Starfox is said to be coming out first. This might seem odd because Nintendo recently showed off the new Zelda.
Much to everyone's surprise, Nintendo actually showed off gameplay for the new Zelda. The game footage shows off potential, but ultimately leaves very much open to the interpretation of the viewer. With so little to go off of, fans can still image the world to be as wonderful as they want it to be. Now that Nintendo has the spotlight back, the Wii U will be on many Christmas lists and commercial ads. Do Sony or Microsoft really stand a chance against Nintendo this holiday season or will they both be dominated?

Yasunari Kawabata (川端 康成, Kawabata Yasunari, 11 June 1899 – 16 April 1972[1]) was a Japanese novelist and short story writer whose spare, lyrical, subtly-shaded prose works won him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, the first Japanese author to receive the award. His works have enjoyed broad international appeal and are still widely read.
Early life [ edit ]
Kawabata in 1917
Born in Osaka, Japan, into a well-established doctor's family,[2] Yasunari was orphaned when he was four, after which he lived with his grandparents. He had an older sister who was taken in by an aunt, and whom he met only once thereafter, at the age of ten (July 1909) (she died when he was 11). Kawabata's grandmother died when he was seven (September 1906), and his grandfather when he was fifteen (May 1914).
Having lost all close relatives, he moved in with his mother's family (the Kurodas). However, in January 1916, he moved into a boarding house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) to which he had formerly commuted by train. Through many of Kawabata's works the sense of distance in his life is represented. He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation. In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote: “I feel as though I have never held a woman's hand in a romantic sense[...] Am I a happy man deserving of pity?”. Indeed, this does not have to be taken literally, but it does show the type of emotional insecurity that Kawabata felt, especially experiencing two painful love affairs at a young age. One of those painful love episodes was with Hatsuyo Ito (伊藤初代, 1906-1951) whom he met when he was 20 years old. His unsent love letter to her was recently found at his former residence in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture.[3] According to Kaori Kawabata, Kawabata's son-in-law, an unpublished entry in the author's diary mentions that Hatsuyo was raped by a monk at the temple she was staying at, which led her to break off their engagement.[4]
After graduating from junior high school in March 1917, just before his 18th birthday, he moved to Tokyo, hoping to pass the exams of Dai-ichi Kōtō-gakkō (First Upper School), which was under the direction of the Tokyo Imperial University. He succeeded in the exam the same year and entered the Humanities Faculty as an English major (July 1920). A young Kawabata, by this time, was enamoured by the works of another Asian Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore.
Kawabata graduated in 1924, by which time he had already caught the attention of Kikuchi Kan and other noted writers and editors through his submissions to Kikuchi's literary magazine, the Bungei Shunju.
In addition to fiction writing, Kawabata also worked as a reporter, most notably for the Mainichi Shimbun. Although he refused to participate in the militaristic fervor that accompanied World War II, he also demonstrated little interest in postwar political reforms. Along with the death of all his family while he was young, Kawabata suggested that the War was one of the greatest influences on his work, stating he would be able to write only elegies in postwar Japan. Still, many commentators detect little thematic change between Kawabata's prewar and postwar writings.

While still a university student, Kawabata re-established the Tokyo University literary magazine Shin-shichō ("New Tide of Thought"), which had been defunct for more than four years. There he published his first short story, "Shokonsai ikkei" ("A View from Yasukuni Festival") in 1921. During university, he changed faculties to Japanese literature and wrote a graduation thesis titled, "A short history of Japanese novels". He graduated from university in March 1924.
New writing movement [ edit ]
In October 1924, Kawabata, Riichi Yokomitsu and other young writers started a new literary journal Bungei Jidai ("The Artistic Age"). This journal was a reaction to the entrenched old school of Japanese literature, specifically the Japanese movement descended from Naturalism, while it also stood in opposition to the "workers'" or proletarian literature movement of the Socialist/Communist schools. It was an "art for art's sake" movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles. The term Shinkankakuha, which Kawabata and Yokomitsu used to describe their philosophy, has often been mistakenly translated into English as "Neo-Impressionism". However, Shinkankakuha was not meant to be an updated or restored version of Impressionism; it focused on offering "new impressions" or, more accurately, "new sensations" or "new perceptions" in the writing of literature.[5] An early example from this period is the draft of Hoshi wo nusunda chichi (The Father who stole a Star), an adaption of Ferenc Molnár's play Liliom.[6]
Career [ edit ]
Kawabata started to achieve recognition with a number of short stories shortly after he graduated, receiving acclaim for "The Dancing Girl of Izu" in 1926, a story about a melancholy student who, on a walking trip down Izu Peninsula, meets a young dancer, and returns to Tokyo in much improved spirits. This story, which explored the dawning eroticism of young love, was successful because he used dashes of melancholy and even bitterness to offset what might have otherwise been overly sweet. Most of his subsequent works explored similar themes.
In the 1920s, Kawabata was living in the plebeian district of Asakusa, Tokyo. During this period, Kawabata experimented with different styles of writing. In Asakusa kurenaidan (The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa), serialized from 1929 to 1930, he explores the lives of the demimonde and others on the fringe of society, in a style echoing that of late Edo period literature. On the other hand, his Suisho genso (Crystalline Fantasy) is pure stream-of-consciousness writing. He was even involved in writing the script for the experimental film A Page of Madness.[7]
In 1933, Kawabata protested publicly against the arrest, torture and death of the young leftist writer Takiji Kobayashi in Tokyo by the Tokkō special political police.
Kawabata relocated from Asakusa to Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, in 1934 and, although he initially enjoyed a very active social life among the many other writers and literary people residing in that city during the war years and immediately thereafter, in his later years he became very reclusive.
One of his most famous novels was Snow Country, started in 1934 and first published in installments from 1935 through 1947. Snow Country is a stark tale of a love affair between a Tokyo dilettante and a provincial geisha, which takes place in a remote hot-spring town somewhere in the mountainous regions of northern Japan. It established Kawabata as one of Japan's foremost authors and became an instant classic, described by Edward G. Seidensticker as "perhaps Kawabata's masterpiece".
After the end of World War II, Kawabata's success continued with novels such as A Thousand Cranes (a story of ill-fated love); The Sound of the Mountain; The House of the Sleeping Beauties; Beauty and Sadness; and The Old Capital.
His two most important post-war works are Sembazuru (Thousand Cranes) from 1949 to 1951, and Yama no Oto (The Sound of the Mountain), 1949–1954. Sembazuru is centered on the tea ceremony and hopeless love. The protagonist is attracted to the mistress of his dead father and, after her death, to her daughter, who flees from him. The tea ceremony provides a beautiful background for ugly human affairs, but Kawabata's intent is rather to explore feelings about death. The tea ceremony utensils are permanent and forever, whereas people are frail and fleeting. These themes of implicit incest, impossible love and impending death are again explored in Yama no Oto, set in Kawabata's home town of Kamakura. The protagonist, an aging man, has become disappointed with his children and no longer feels strong passion for his wife. He is strongly attracted to someone forbidden — his daughter-in-law — and his thoughts for her are interspersed with memories of another forbidden love, for his dead sister-in-law.
The book that he himself considered his finest work, The Master of Go (1951), contrasts sharply with his other works. It is a semi-fictional recounting of a major Go match in 1938, on which Kawabata had actually reported for the Mainichi newspaper chain. It was the last game of the master Shūsai's career and he lost to his younger challenger, only to die a little over a year later. Although the novel is moving on the surface as a retelling of a climactic struggle, some readers consider it a symbolic parallel to the defeat of Japan in World War II.
Kawabata left many of his stories apparently unfinished, sometimes to the annoyance of readers and reviewers, but this goes hand to hand with his aesthetics of art for art's sake, leaving outside any sentimentalism, or morality, that an ending would give to any book. This was done intentionally, as Kawabata felt that vignettes of incidents along the way were far more important than conclusions. He equated his form of writing with the traditional poetry of Japan, the haiku.
Awards [ edit ]
As the president of Japanese P.E.N. for many years after the war (1948–1965), Kawabata was a driving force behind the translation of Japanese literature into English and other Western languages. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters of France in 1960, and awarded Japan's Order of Culture the following year.
Nobel Prize [ edit ]
Kawabata in 1968
Kawabata was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature on 16 October 1968, the first Japanese person to receive such a distinction.[8] In awarding the prize "for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind", the Nobel Committee cited three of his novels, Snow Country, A Thousand Cranes, and The Old Capital.[9]
Kawabata's Nobel Lecture was titled "Japan, The Beautiful and Myself" (美しい日本の私―その序説). Zen Buddhism was a key focal point of the speech; much was devoted to practitioners and the general practices of Zen Buddhism and how it differed from other types of Buddhism. He presented a severe picture of Zen Buddhism, where disciples can enter salvation only through their efforts, where they are isolated for several hours at a time, and how from this isolation there can come beauty. He noted that Zen practices focus on simplicity and it is this simplicity that proves to be the beauty. "The heart of the ink painting is in space, abbreviation, what is left undrawn." From painting he moved on to talk about ikebana and bonsai as art forms that emphasize the simplicity and the beauty that arises from the simplicity. "The Japanese garden, too, of course symbolizes the vastness of nature."[10]
In addition to the numerous mentions of Zen and nature, one point that was briefly mentioned in Kawabata's lecture was that of suicide. Kawabata reminisced of other famous Japanese authors who committed suicide, in particular Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. He contradicted the custom of suicide as being a form of enlightenment, mentioning the priest Ikkyū, who also thought of suicide twice. He quoted Ikkyū, "Among those who give thoughts to things, is there one who does not think of suicide?" There was much speculation about this quote being a clue to Kawabata's suicide in 1972, two years after Mishima had committed suicide.[citation needed]
Death [ edit ]
Kawabata apparently committed suicide in 1972 by gassing himself, but a number of close associates, including his widow, consider his death to have been accidental. One thesis, as advanced by Donald Richie, was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath. Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself, among them poor health (the discovery that he had Parkinson's disease), a possible illicit love affair, or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970.[11] Unlike Mishima, Kawabata left no note, and since (again unlike Mishima) he had not discussed significantly in his writings the topic of taking his own life, his motives remain unclear. However, his Japanese biographer, Takeo Okuno, has related how he had nightmares about Mishima for two or three hundred nights in a row, and was incessantly haunted by the specter of Mishima. In a persistently depressed state of mind, he would tell friends during his last years that sometimes, when on a journey, he hoped his plane would crash.

On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data showing that overdose deaths caused by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl—the drug that killed Prince—rose by nearly 75 percent in 2015. On the same day, federal prosecutors in Massachusetts announced the arrest of six former employees, including a former CEO and two former vice presidents, of the Phoenix-based and NASDAQ-traded fentanyl producer Insys Therapeutics. The individuals are charged with bribing doctors and otherwise conspiring to induce the overprescription of a fentanyl product called Subsys.
The indictment details a variety of brazenly dishonest methods by which doctors and insurance companies were allegedly convinced to issue and fund prescriptions of Subsys:
Insys paid doctors to give educational lectures about the use of Subsys. That's ostensibly legal, except that prosecutors allege that the company paid said doctors in direct proportion to the frequency with which they wrote Subsys prescriptions, with one Insys employee allegedly texting another that the doctors hired to give lectures “do not need to be good speakers” so long as they were high-volume Susbys prescribers. These “lectures,” meanwhile were allegedly often nothing more than dinners at high-end restaurants attended only by the doctors getting paid, the Subsys employees paying them, and the doctor's friends. One Florida doctor is alleged to have made $275,000 in speaking fee bribes in three years.
Insys allegedly continued to work with some doctors who prescribed Subsys frequently even after becoming aware internally that those doctors were known for running dubiously legal Dr. Feelgood “pill mills.” Wrote one Insys employee in an email about an Illinois doctor that the company would continue to work with and pay speaking fees to: “He is extremely moody, lazy and inattentive. He basically just shows up to sign his name on the prescription pad, if he shows up at all.”
Insys allegedly hired support staff employees to mislead insurance companies into approving payments for Subsys prescriptions. These support staff employees allegedly misled insurers into believing they were interacting with representatives of doctor's offices rather than representatives of Insys—employees were allegedly instructed to hang up the phone when insurers “pursued the identity of their employer.” These support staff employees are also accused of systematically falsifying specific diagnosis information—claiming patients had difficulty swallowing, for example—that they knew would make insurers more likely to authorize Subsys purchases.
In a statement, Insys says it is “committed to complying with laws and regulations that govern our products and business practices” and “continues to cooperate with all relevant authorities in … ongoing investigations.” (Several Insys employees and medical professionals affiliated with the company have also been arrested in recent years in cases that have led to at least two convictions.) An attorney for one of the arrested individuals—Alec Burlakoff—says his client is not guilty. The other individuals do not appear to have commented.
The surge in opioid deaths is one of the reasons that United States life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time in 22 years. In that same year, Insys reported a profit of $58.5 million.
There's no hiding a rock star. So when David Byrne, the former frontman of Talking Heads, walked into Il Cantinori in Greenwich Village recently, wearing a navy twill jumpsuit and a snow-white puffer coat (and having just arrived on bicycle), the only person who held a candle to his bold chic was Cyndi Lauper, the flame-haired singer who arrived in slim black leggings and top, her hands sprinkled with silver jewelry. They came to talk about their musical pasts in the 1970s and '80s New York, and their shared theatrical presents — she as the Tony-winning composer and lyricist of the Broadway hit “Kinky Boots,” and he as the Obie-winning creator of the musical spectacle “Here Lies Love,” about the former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos, which will resume its run at the Public Theater next month. Over calamari and mushroom salad (for Mr. Byrne) and pasta and arugula salad (for Ms. Lauper), they spoke with The New York Times about artistic growth, recovering from career setbacks and how music can save your life.

Earlier this month, in Duncan, Oklahoma, Woodrow Wilson Elementary School teacher Erica Mackey announced she had a surprise for her third-grade students:
The student reports that Mrs. Mackey announced that she had “the holy Bible” and asked if anyone would like one. Nearly all the students walked up to her desk and she handed them out. After seeing his classmates take Bibles from the teacher, the child felt peer-pressured and coerced to do the same.
Thankfully, that child told his mother, and she contacted the American Humanist Association's Appignani Humanist Legal Center. They sent a letter to the district explaining how church/state separation works.
The District eventually relented, assuring the AHA that teachers will no longer be allowed to distribute religious material to children.
They did say, however, that they would allow passive distribution of religious materials for high school students (in other words, they would permit an outside group to set up a table with Bibles). And just as we saw in Florida, a Satanic church quickly requested permission to distribute materials. Hilarious.
Anyway, the mother who initially informed the AHA about the Bible distribution is namedand it turns out, following the backlash from this whole debacle, she decided to pull her son out of Duncan Public Schools.
Koni, a blogger at Atheist Analysis, interviewed Lea about what's happened over the past month and her responses are just heartbreaking:
Koni: Did the possibility of retaliation [from Christians] cross your mind? Lea: Not once. Koni: I suppose you didn't really have time to consider that possibility. At what point did you begin to fear for the safety of your child and yourself? Lea: I began to fear for mine and my sons safety when I read “run her out of town” and “snitches end up in ditches.” I have the comments in an email, but I'd have to go through hundreds of comments to find them. I feared for my son when the parents all had their kids carry their bibles to school one day, to prove a point. Kids are mean. I couldn't let my son face that kind of ridicule for not having a bible. Koni: “Snitches end up in ditches?” That is certainly unnerving. I can't imagine anyone feeling safe with people openly making death threats, like that. Do you have plans to move out of the community? Lea: Yes. My house is for sale.
Ugh… and all because Lea opposed an illegal Bible distribution in her son's classroom. She did the right thing and Christians (presumably full of the love of Christ) have pressured her to move away and pull her child out of school. He's currently under the supervision of another homeschooling mother. It's unclear what they'll do with him next year.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder characterised by hypotonia and developmental delay as an infant and obesity, learning disability and behavioural problems (especially relating to food) in adolescence and adulthood.
Genetics
PWS was the first human disorder attributed to genomic imprinting. It is caused by:[1]
Deletion of the paternally inherited chromosomal 15q11.2-q13 region (occasionally a result of translocation). These are the majority.
Maternal uniparental disomy 15 caused by chromosomal nondisjunction (both copies are from the mother).
A defect in the imprinting process in the 15q11.2-q13 region on the paternally inherited chromosome.
The opposite, ie maternal deletion or paternal uniparental disomy, causes Angelman's syndrome.
Epidemiology
It is relatively common - prevalence 1/15,000-1/30,000.[1] Despite the genetic cause it appears to be sporadic rather than inherited in a Mendelian pattern. Sex ratio is equal and it occurs in all races.
Diagnostic criteria
As diagnostic tests are now available these should serve to raise suspicion and ensure that all appropriate people are tested, but avoid the expense and worry of unnecessary testing.[2]
From birth to age 3 requires 5 points including 4 major criteria.
Age 3 to adult requires 8 total points including 5 major criteria.
Major criteria (1 point each):
Neonatal or infantile central hypotonia with a poor suck. This gradually improves with age.
Feeding problems in infancy or failure to thrive.
Excessive weight gain between 1 and 6 years of age. Morphological and hormonal abnormalities of the pituitary gland are found in PWS. [3] Marked differences in obesity have been found between patients living in different countries. It is thought that these differences could be explained by differences in management. [4]
Marked differences in obesity have been found between patients living in different countries. It is thought that these differences could be explained by differences in management. Characteristic facial features (narrow face, almond-shaped eyes, etc).
Hypogonadism - genital hypoplasia and/or delayed or incomplete gonadal maturation (this is not always associated with infertility in boys). [5]
Cryptorchidism is common.
Global developmental delay (in child aged <6 years). They may not sit until 12 months, or walk until 24 months. Older children show mild-to-moderate learning difficulties and an IQ of 50 to 70.
Hyperphagia with excessive appetite or food obsession.
Chromosomal abnormality - deletion 15q 11-13 or other appropriate molecular abnormality in this chromosomal region.
Minor criteria (0.5 points each):
Decreased fetal movements, infantile lethargy or weak cry in infancy, which improves with age.
Characteristic behavioural problems (typically tantrums or obsessive/compulsive behaviour). [6] Adults may have psychotic episodes.
Adults may have psychotic episodes. Sleep disturbance/sleep apnoea.
Short stature in childhood and failure of pubertal growth spurt.
Hypopigmentation - fair skin and hair.
Small hands and feet.
Narrow hands with straight ulnar border.
Eye abnormalities (esotropia, myopia).
Thick, viscous saliva ± crusting at mouth corners.
Speech articulation defects.
Skin picking.
Other features which may be present, many of them related to problems of the hypothalamus:
High pain threshold.
Decreased vomiting.
Temperature instability or altered temperature sensitivity.
Scoliosis or kyphosis (66.7% at skeletal maturity in one series of 145 patients). [7]
Early adrenarche (pubic or axillary hair before age 8) despite retardation of other sexual development.
Obesity may cause type 2 diabetes at an early age, also called 'maturity onset diabetes of the young' (MODY).
Osteoporosis (because of hypogonadism). Along with a high pain threshold this can lead to pathological fractures that are not instantly recognised.
They display an unusual skill with jigsaw puzzles. [8]
IQ is usually in the range of 60 to 80 but with expected individual variation. Genetic subtypes of the condition have differing IQ strengths - verbal vs performance IQ.[9]
PWS patients have a different gait from individuals who are simply obese.[10]
Presentation
This may be seen as a disease in two stages:
After birth there is hypotonia, failure to thrive and sleepiness. The child usually has blue eyes and blond hair. They tend to lag behind other children in the transition to solid food.
The second stage becomes apparent at the age of 12-18 months, when an exceptional interest in food becomes apparent.[6] Hyperphagia, obesity, hypogonadism, short stature and sleep apnoea and cor pulmonale occur.[11] They have markedly elevated levels of ghrelin, a hormone associated with hunger.[12]
Diagnosis
DNA methylation analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) techniques can diagnose PWS in all three types of PWS, as well as differentiate PWS from Angelman's syndrome in deletion cases.[1]
Other tests:
If the patient is obese, screening for glucose intolerance is advised.
Endocrine studies include insulin-like growth factor, lipids and thyroid function. LDL tends to be high and HDL low.
Body composition analysis by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), anthropometry or another method. DEXA is used to assess fat mass rather than bone mineral density in this case.
Psychological and/or educational testing.
Differential diagnosis
Management
A multidisciplinary approach is essential:
Family support is essential to cope with the behavioural difficulties throughout childhood. The child must be kept away from excessive food intake to guard against subsequent obesity. [13] Their energy requirements are only about 75% of that of a normal child and hyperphagia can occasionally be dangerous, causing massive stomach dilation. Regular exercise is important.
Their energy requirements are only about 75% of that of a normal child and hyperphagia can occasionally be dangerous, causing massive stomach dilation. Regular exercise is important. Input from a paediatric gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, dietician, occupational therapists, speech therapists, exercise advisors and orthopaedic consultants may be helpful. Bariatric surgery has had poor results compared with normal, obese adolescents. [14]
Management of the transition period from childhood to adulthood is important and placement in a residential home may need to be considered. [15] The GP will continue to provide care throughout the transition and during adulthood. Specific points related to PWS to consider during a health check include: Sleep apnoea (obstructive, central or mixed) - even where obesity is not a problem. Scoliosis, kyphosis. Osteoporosis. Oedema. Cellulitis. Hypothyroidism. Gastroparesis. Type 2 diabetes. Skin infections (consequence of skin-picking). Squint, myopia.
The GP will continue to provide care throughout the transition and during adulthood. Specific points related to PWS to consider during a health check include:
Pharmacological
Growth hormone is essential to maintain normal growth, muscle development and avoid obesity. [11, 16] One study found that growth hormone also improved behavioural difficulties. [17] Growth hormone treatment was initially thought to make scoliosis worse but this has been refuted. [18]
One study found that growth hormone also improved behavioural difficulties. Growth hormone treatment was initially thought to make scoliosis worse but this has been refuted. Appetite suppressant drugs are of no value. Long-acting octreotide reduces ghrelin secretion but does not affect behaviour or weight. [19]
Many drugs have been used to modify behaviour but they tend to be ineffective or even counterproductive. Olanzapine may have an effect.
Haloperidol and fluoxetine are sometimes effective.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) seem to have a nonspecific behaviour-stabilising effect, with fewer outbursts, a marked reduction in irritability and less perseveration but with no antidepressant effect.
All these drugs may be tried with care. None is universally successful and they may even be counterproductive.
Genetic counselling
Recurrence risk depends on the mechanism causing PWS in the individual:[20]
Deletion is sporadic and has a recurrence rate of ≤1% (except in the rare cases where a chromosomal rearrangement is present in the father).
Maternal uniparental disomy 15 is typically de novo also with a recurrence rate of ≤1% (except if a Robertsonian translocation is present in either parent).
A proportion of those with an imprinting defect have a microdeletion in the imprinting centre; this can be familial and has a 50% recurrence risk when it is. However, the greater proportion of those with an imprinting defect have an epigenetic mutation and the recurrence risk is ≤1% for this group.
Prognosis
Obesity-related cardiovascular and respiratory disorders are the most frequent causes of death in children and adults. Based on a population study, the death rate has been estimated at 3% per year.[20]
By Todd J. Gillman
The world is filled with stormy relationships. North and South Korea. Dez Bryant and the Dallas Cowboys. Texas and Washington.
The state tussles with the federal government constantly -- over health care, pollution limits, civil rights enforcement and border security. But for all the friction and mistrust, there's also mutual interest. Money flows both ways. They fight Ebola together.
It's complicated.
Take last week. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court handed Texas a huge win in its fight to derail the president's immigration policies. Gov. Greg Abbott -- whose top priority as attorney general was taking Washington to court -- boasted of the decision as a triumph for the rule of law over central government overreach.
By Friday night, with much of the state flooded, Abbott was reaching out for federal disaster aid.
"They extend the middle finger to Washington, and now all the fingers are outstretched looking for a handout," grumbled immigrant advocate Frank Sharry, who views Texas as a major impediment to what he considers justice for 5 million longtime U.S. residents.
Texans -- especially but not exclusively the Republicans who control the state -- eye Washington with deep suspicion. The antagonists have tangled on border security, energy and education policy, endangered species protections, gay marriage and a host of other issues.
Maybe it's Texas pride at the not-quite-decade it spent as a country. Maybe it's Washington that's out of touch. Bottom line, this couple has grown apart.
"What I find is a growing distrust of the federal government. It's not just about the president. It's about leaders in both parties," said JoAnn Fleming, a Texas tea party leader in Tyler. "On a myriad of issues, they feel that Washington is just incompetent."
35% of state's budget
Until a decade ago, it was tempting to trace resentment to inequity. Texas residents and businesses had long sent more tax money to Washington than the state got back. That's no longer true, thanks to demographic changes, growth in military spending and other factors.
Fleming likes to cite research from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation showing that only 10 states' budgets rely more heavily on federal funds. Washington accounts for 35 percent of Texas' current two-year budget -- a statistic she uses to underscore the need for a backup plan, in case fiscal sanity ever takes hold in Washington.
"Texas has its hand on that debt shovel as much as anybody else," she said.
Border security is one of the many areas of acute disagreement and alternate realities.
The new two-year budget that lawmakers have sent to Abbott would set aside $800 million to beef up security. Texas leaders blame the need for such spending on federal failures.
But federal officials insist the border has never been more secure. The Border Patrol has doubled. The number of people in the country illegally has dropped by 1 million in the last eight years.
And then there's Operation Jade Helm 15.
Amid far-right concerns of impending martial law, Abbott ordered the state militia to monitor the eight-week U.S. military exercise spanning seven states, which the Pentagon calls a routine training operation.
"Texas is a big state with lots of people in it. Some see conspiracy whenever an agent of the federal government shows up; others see a potential protector or helper," said University of Texas at Austin historian and author H.W. Brands. "Lots of Western conservatives dream of breaking loose of Washington. The Texas version of the dream channels an actual moment in Texas history."
Disdain for feds
Widespread disdain for the federal government could explain why Abbott, at a news conference after the storms, thanked four neighboring governors for offering aid, while making no mention that a few hours earlier, President Barack Obama had assured him that he would expedite federal assistance.
"The federal government is a particularly convenient foil given President Obama's high unpopularity," said Mark Jones, chairman of political science at Rice University. "You're always going to have this tension between Texas and Washington. ... But let's imagine Scott Walker becomes president. We're likely to see the level of anti-D.C. rhetoric drop precipitously."
The deadly storms put a fresh spotlight on the tensions.
On Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz proclaimed that, along with other Texans in Congress, he would insist on the state getting its due in recovery aid.
A feeding frenzy ensued on the left. Hadn't the tea party senator voted against Hurricane Sandy relief back in 2013? Well, yes. But like other conservatives, he cited concerns that the $60 billion price tag was bloated.
Still, Sharry imagined the Northeasterners in Congress giddy at the idea of making Texas grovel: "You guys weren't there in our hour of need, and you accuse the federal government of invading the state."
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- one of Cruz's rivals for the White House in 2016 -- took nearly that tack. Asked Friday if he views Cruz as a hypocrite, he noted the congressional delays on Sandy but said: "The folks in Texas deserve to get federal aid to help them, and this is not the kind of thing where we should be playing tit for tat."
Feelings run deep
In Austin, anti-Washington sentiment runs deep. Two weeks ago, the Texas House overwhelmingly approved a call to amend the U.S. Constitution to curb federal spending, powers and jurisdiction.
"It's time for the states to exercise state sovereignty," the author of that resolution, state Rep. Rick Miller, R-Sugar Land, said by phone from Austin. "Our 36 congressmen from Texas, the majority of them are conservative and they understand the issues. But they're only 36 out of 435."
It wasn't always that way.
Lyndon Johnson, master of the U.S. Senate, was revered for his ability to manipulate the levers of power to deliver such tangibles as rural electrification. Even within the past decade, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison enjoyed widespread affection for her own skill at securing funds for research, roads and local projects.
By the 2010 elections, the tea party wave was cresting. Gov. Rick Perry turned Hutchison's earmarking acumen against her in the GOP primary, to devastating effect. Before Cruz or Abbott, he positioned himself as a 10th Amendment, states' rights champion.
To Jones, the Rice professor, tensions arise because on gun rights, abortion, taxes and most other debates, Texas tends to be more conservative than the nation overall.
"The nation is constantly trying to pull Texas closer to the center," he said.

Protesters dismissed the results of the national dialogue, with some saying: ''We are Staying'' [Reuters]
Tens of thousands have marched outside Bahrain's capital Manama, protesting against the results of a national dialogue they say has failed to bring real democratic reform in the Gulf island kingdom.
Shouting "We want freedom" and waving Bahraini flags and banners that read "No to dialogue", protesters marched along Budaiya highway on Friday as helicopters from the security forces buzzed overhead.
Some began to shout "Down, down, Hamad" in the Friday march, which organisers entitled "The people are the source of authority".
King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa on Thursday approved parliamentary reforms submitted by a state-appointed body dialogue commission.
The process "reflects the determination [of the participants] to rise above the latest incidents," King Hamad said in a televised speech on Thursday.
"We have ordered the executive and legislative authorities to take the necessary measures to approve the agreements," he said after receiving a report by the state-appointed National Dialogue, set up to address grievances after the government crackdown.
The changes grant more powers of scrutiny to the elected lower house of parliament but preserve the dominance of the upper house appointed by the royal elite.
Bahrain's Sunni rulers launched the formal dialogue in July, aiming to quell international criticism of its crushing of mass pro-democracy protests led by the Shia majority in February and March.
Widespread disapproval
Opposition groups and many in the Shia population argued their voice in the dialogue was overshadowed by a majority of pro-government participants. The government said it had selected representation that accurately reflected society.
Wefaq, the largest Shia opposition group, walked out of the dialogue several weeks ago and now members said they felt their actions were justified after the body's results were announced.
"The government thought the results were great. We thought they were nothing," Sayed al-Mousawi, a Wefaq leader, said. "There's no fully elected government, no reforms to the voting system. It's a one-sided deal."
Shia Bahrainis have long complained of discrimination in jobs and services and accuse the government of gerrymandering electoral districts, charges the government denies.
Khalil al-Marzouq, a Wefaq spokesman, said the final proposals vindicated his group's decision to boycott.
"The reason we pulled out is because of this. The upper house should only be there for consultation," he said.
The lower house of parliament currently holds limited authority since all the country's decisions, including the appointment of government ministers, ultimately rest with the king.
Other proposed reforms are aimed at addressing "the need for fairer electoral constituencies", though the recommendations stopped short of specifically calling for the realigning of electoral districts that members of the opposition say are unfairly drawn.

According to the new proposal, the prime minister, appointed by the king, would have to secure the approval of parliament for members of his government.
"If MPs disapprove they can vote to reject the entire government. Parliament will also have the power to reject the government's four-year work plan," it said.
"These reforms guarantee that the government's composition and work plan will reflect the will of the people."
It also said cabinet ministers would have to attend some parliament sessions and face questioning in the open chamber rather than within the framework of committees.
Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman, the prime minister of 40 years, is regarded as a leading figure within the ruling family, who opposes concessions to the opposition.
Bahrain's Sunni Muslim rulers called in troops from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states in March to help quell protests dominated by the majority Shia community.
The government said the unrest was sectarian and backed by non-Arab Shia power Iran, which the Bahraini Shias have denied.
Bahrain, home port to the US Fifth Fleet, lies on a tense faultline between Shia Iran, just across the Gulf, and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia, which is connected to the tiny Gulf Arab state by a causeway.
Hundreds were arrested during Bahrain's crackdown on the large protests in March, and dozens have yet to be released.
Protesters on Friday had hoped to stage a protest outside the US embassy in Manama ahead of their evening march.
But riot police set up several checkpoints to block entrance to the area.
Sit-down-and-shut-up "Christian" Ford dealership is run by a non-church attendee who is sorry about the ad
Remember the Ford dealership that ran a radio ad telling non-Christians to "sit down and shut up?"
"JW Horne," who claims he works for the dealership writing the ads posted to his blog, defending his decision, telling "non-believers" and "plain doubters" that we are "in the minority and as loud as you yell and protest, you will always be in the minority."
But today, Rick Kieffe, owner of Kieffe and Sons Ford in Mojave and Rosamond, publicly apologized for the ad, saying that a) he doesn't actually attend church, and b) he didn't approve the ad.
“It's just something that went by us,” said Kieffe, who does not attend church but considers himself “a Christian spirit.” “We're obviously sorry that it offends a given segment who identifies themselves as atheist.”

Technical data on the five, German-built, Dolphin-class submersible nuclear-armed warships [pictured left] of the IDF's Naval Warfare Arm:
The Dolphin class fleet actually comprises two related sub-classes of diesel-electric submarine developed and constructed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW), Germany for the Israeli Navy. The first boats of the class were based on the export-only German 209-class submarines, but modified and enlarged. The Dolphin 1 sub-class is slightly larger than the German Navy Type 212 in length and displacement. The three newer air-independent propulsion (AIP) equipped boats are similar to the Type 212 vessels in underwater endurance, are 12 metres (39 ft) longer, nearly 500 tonnes heavier in submerged displacement and have a larger crew than either the Type 212 or the Type 214.
The Dolphin 2-class are the largest submarines to have been built in Germany since World War II. The Dolphin class boats are the most expensive single vehicles in the Israel Defense Forces. The Dolphin-class replaced the aging Gal-class submarines, which had served in the Israeli navy since the late 1970s. Each Dolphin-class submarine is capable of carrying a combined total of up to 16 torpedoes and SLCMs.
The cruise missiles have a range of at least 1,500 km (930 mi) and are widely believed to be equipped with a 200-kilogram (440 lb) nuclear warhead containing up to 6 kilograms (13 lb) of plutonium. The latter, if true, would provide Israel with an offshore nuclear second strike capability and mean that virtually all the countries of Europe and North Africa would be within range of its nuclear warheads, if fired from an Israeli submarine in the central Mediterranean. This would include:
ALGERIA| AUSTRIA| BULGARIA| EGYPT| FRANCE| GERMANY| GREECE| ITALY| HOLLAND| HUNGARY| JORDAN| LIBYA| MOROCCO| POLAND| SPAIN| SYRIA| SAUDI- ARABIA| TURKEY| UNITED-KINGDOM| UKRAINE , amongst others.
Each submarine is fitted with 6 × 533 mm (21.0 in) torpedo tubes, and 4 × 650 mm (26 in) torpedo tubes. The very large 650 mm tubes can be used for laying mines, larger submarine-launched cruise missiles, or swimmer delivery vehicles, and with liners the tubes could be used for standard torpedoes and submarine-launched missiles. According to the German Defense Ministry the 650 mm tubes are to have a liner installed for firing 533 mm UGM-84 Harpoon missiles although the Dolphin class already has six tubes of the 533 mm size. The boats were first armed with Atlas Elektronik DM2A3 torpedoes using wire-guided active homing to deliver a 260 kg (570 lb) warhead at a maximum speed of 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph) to a target over 13 km (8.1 mi) away, in passive homing mode a speed of 22 knots (41 km/h; 25 mph) and a range up to 28 km (17 mi) is possible. Israel also has procured the DM2A4 torpedo, successor to their DM2A3s, which are electrically propelled, equipped with fiber optic communications and has countermeasure resistant signals processing and mission logic. A wet and dry compartment is installed for deploying underwater special operations teams. According to Defense Industry Daily the IDAS torpedo tube launched anti-helicopter missile, designed to defend against airborne threats while submerged in shallow water found in the Mediterranean where escape to depth is often not possible, is under development for the Dolphin and 212 classes.
Jane's Defence Weekly reports that the Dolphin-class submarines are believed to be nuclear armed, offering Israel a sea based second strike capability. In adherence to Missile Technology Control Regime rules] the US Clinton administration refused an Israeli request in 2000 to purchase Tomahawk long range SLCMs. The U.S. Navy has deployed nuclear armed and conventional Tomahawk missiles for its submarine fleet which are launched from standard heavy 533 mm torpedo tubes. The Federation of American Scientists and GlobalSecurity.org report that the four larger torpedo tubes are capable of launching Israeli built nuclear-armed Popeye Turbo cruise missiles (a variant of the Popeye standoff missile), and the U.S. Navy recorded an Israeli submarine-launched cruise missile test in the Indian Ocean ranging 1,500 km (930 mi).
The Dolphin class uses the ISUS 90-1 TCS weapon control system supplied by STN Atlas Elektronik, for automatic sensor management, fire control, navigation, and operations. The installed radar warning receiver is a 4CH(V)2 Timnex electronic support measures system, scanning from 2 GHz to 18 GHz frequency bands and able to pinpoint radar sites with accuracy between 1.4 to 5 degrees of angle (depending on frequency). It is developed by Elbit in Haifa. Active surface search radar is an Elta unit operating on I band. The sonar suite includes the Atlas Elektronik CSU 90 hull-mounted passive and active search and attack sonar. The PRS-3 passive ranging sonar is also supplied by Atlas Elektronik, the flank array is a FAS-3 passive search sonar. The submarines have two Kollmorgen periscopes.
The Dolphins are equipped with three V-16 396 SE 84 diesel engines built by MTU Friedrichshafen (now Tognum), developing 3.12 MW (4,180 hp) sustained power. The submarines are equipped with three Siemens 750 kW alternators, and a Siemens 2.85 MW sustained-power motor driving a single shaft. The propulsion system provides a speed of 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph) submerged and a snorkeling speed of 11 knots (20 km/h; 13 mph). The hull is rated for dives up to 350 m (1,150 ft). The maximum unrefuelled range is 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km; 9,200 mi) traveling on the surface at 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph) and over 400 nautical miles (740 km; 460 mi) at 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph) submerged; they are designed to remain unsupplied for up to 30 days on station.
Operations and deployment
According to news reports the submarines are normally based in the Mediterranean.[51] One Dolphin was sent to the Red Sea for exercises, briefly docking in the naval base in Eilat in June 2009, which Israeli media interpreted as a warning to Iran.[52] In 2009 the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, quoting an Israeli defense official, reported that the small Eilat naval station is unsuited strategically to base the Dolphin-class boats, specifically noting the tight entrance of the Gulf of Aqaba at the Straits of Tiran as one held by potential adversaries including Saudi Arabia on the east and the demilitarized Egyptian Sinai to the west. Eilat is a 10 km (6.2 mi) strip of coast between Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab states that currently have peace treaties with Israel. According to The London Sunday Times, the Israeli Navy decided in May 2010 to keep at least one submarine equipped with nuclear missiles there permanently as a deterrent in response to rumored ballistic missiles moved from Syria to Lebanon.[16]
If the boats are based at the larger Haifa naval base, access to the Persian Gulf area either requires openly sailing on the surface through the Egyptian controlled Suez Canal as permitted in the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty or a long voyage sailing around Africa. According to the Convention of Constantinople signed by the ruling great powers of the time including the UK, France, and the Ottoman Empire in March 2, 1888; “The Suez Maritime Canal shall always be free and open, in time of war as in time of peace, to every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of flag.” Denied crossing at the Suez Canal and blockade of the Straits of Tiran occurred in both in 1956 and 1967 leading to Israel twice seizing the Sinai to break the blockade.[54] The Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty allows for the free passage of Israeli vessels through the Suez Canal, and recognizes the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways. Even if a Red Sea or Indian Ocean base is unavailable other nations have used submarine tenders, ships that resupply, rearm, and refuel submarines at sea, when nearby friendly bases are unavailable.

ANNEX
*** 10 Disturbing Facts about Israel
1. Netanyahu heads the only undeclared nuclear weapons entity on the planet yet still alleges that non- nuclear Iran is trying to eliminate the state of Israel and its 100s of undeclared warheads in its Dimona secret arsenal, in an abortive effort to damage the internationally agreed Iran peace deal, painstakingly negotiated by the UN Security Council members and the EU. His political machinations in both Washington and Europe, have now resulted in ignominious failure as Iran re-joins the international community.
2. His Likud coalition government refuses to be a party to both the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions (CWC / BWC) to which EU members and other major UN states are signatories. Neither is it a party to the NPT nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as it refuses to submit its undeclared nuclear arsenal to the IAEA inspection of the United Nations.
3. His right-wing, extremist government supports the continued illegal occupation and settlement of the Palestinian West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in violation of international law, in addition to continuing a blockade of essential materials to 1.8 million in Gaza, both of which have earned global condemnation.
4. He exerts a wholly undemocratic influence over the Republican, AIPAC -dominated US congress in Washington thereby disproportionately skewing American foreign policy in favour of Israel and obtaining US$6 billion of arms shipments annually to maintain its blockade of Gaza and its illegal settlement policy.
5. His family background includes a documented previous close association with terrorist organisations notably the Irgun Zvai Leumi paramilitary.
6. His government is in continued breach of the human rights provisions of the EU Association Agreement that currently affords Israel free trade access to the European single market – now subject to review.
7. He allows the so-called ‘pricetag' terrorists to continue to persecute Arab residents in the Occupied Territories by the burning and destruction of olive groves and businesses in a program of uncontrolled intimidation.
8. He continually threatens to restrict access to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque as did his failed predecessor, Ariel Sharon, apparently in a bid to provoke violence and dissent. This, notwithstanding the UN declaration of Jerusalem as an international city with unrestricted access to all faiths, in perpetuity.
9. He is the leader of a party whose published charter requires the ethnic cleansing of indigenous Palestinians in order to establish a Greater Israel in all of former Palestine.
10. Likud's official agenda to establish the so-called ‘facts on the ground' is a blatant attempt to abort the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. This illegal program has recently been condemned by the Chinese government as well as by the EU, Russia and the US and is now expected to lead to global economic, political and sporting sanctions.

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
The anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions Movement justifies its racist persecution of Jewish Israeli businesses in Australia, the UK, Europe and North America with the accusation that Israel is an apartheid state.
They like to imagine that their campaign of aggressive protests around tiny retail cosmetics stands and chocolate shops is comparable to the mass protests against the Springbok rugby team that characterized the campaign against South African apartheid in the 1970s and ‘80s.
The author is an Australian solicitor working for Shurat HaDin – The Israel Law Center in Tel Aviv. He recently brought a complaint under Australia's Racial Discrimination Act against one of the leaders of the BDS movement in Australia, Prof. Jake Lynch of Sydney University.
But the analogy between Israel and apartheid South Africa is false on every level. A comparison of Israel with Australia, a country generally admired for its freedom and successful multiculturalism, reveals this clearly.As will be demonstrated below, Israel is one of the most un-apartheid states in the world, with a record of successful multiculturalism, protection and integration of minorities that puts most western countries, including Australia, to shame.APARTHEID SOUTH Africa had a system of strictly enforced laws that enshrined racial discrimination against “blacks” and “coloreds” in every aspect of South African society. This was similar to, but more extreme than, the system of racist laws that Australia had in place prior to the recognition of indigenous Australians as equal citizens in 1967 (by Constitutional amendment).In contrast to Australia and South Africa's foundational racism, Israel's declaration of independence in 1948 guaranteed “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.”Unlike South Africa and Australia, Israel has never had laws that overtly discriminated between citizens on the basis of race.Today, just like Australia and most western countries, Israel has strong anti-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, land of origin, sex, sexual orientation, political views, personal status or parenthood in a broad range of contexts. Israeli law also prohibits incitement to racism.These laws are more stringently enforced in Israel than in Australia because of the plethora of NGOs, well funded by the EU, that specialize in searching out and bringing to court any cases of indirect racism against Arabs or Muslims. Unlike Australia, Israel allows NGOs to bring such cases directly to its Supreme Court.But there is more to the elimination of racism in a society than repealing racist laws and passing laws outlawing racial discrimination. Practical outcomes of successful multi-culturalism and integration of minorities at all levels is the true measure of the elimination of racism in a society.And it is by this measure that Israel puts Australia and much of the western world to shame.The practical reality in Israel is that minorities achieve prominent positions at a far higher rate than in Australia.This is true in all areas of society: • Politics: In Israel, 10 percent of Israel's Knesset are from Arab minority groups (Christian, Muslim and Druse).This includes over 4% from parties with racially mixed composition. This large representation of minorities has been a consistent feature since the early days of the state.Three members of religious and racial minorities, Nawaf Massalha (Muslim Arab), Salah Tarif and Raleb Majadele (both Druse) have served at ministerial level in the Israeli government, including the later two as Cabinet ministers.By contrast, only 1.3% of Australia's current federal Parliament are from religious minorities (one Muslim and two Jews) and this itself is a huge increase from previous Parliaments that often featured less than 0.5% non-Christian representation. While there have been a similar number of Australian Jews who have served as ministers, no other religious minority has been so represented.• Judiciary: Israel has a judge from the Arab minority serving on its highest court (Salim Joubran). Sadly, Australia has not had a single High Court judge from a racial or religious minority for over 80 years, since Sir Issac Issacs! • Military: Israel has three Druse generals currently (or recently) serving in its defence forces (Major-General Yusef Mishleb and brigadier-generals Imad Fares and Hasson Hasson). Disturbingly, it appears Australia has not had a single general from a religious or racial minority for over 80 years, since Sir John Monash! The legislature, judiciary and military are the key sources of hard power in any society and the success of racial and religious minorities reaching these corridors of power is a litmus test of the true openness and lack of racism in a society. Australia's scorecard on this test compares very poorly to Israel's.But success of minorities in areas of soft power is an equally important measure, and here, too, Israel outclasses Australia.• Socio-Economic Statistics: In Israel the life expectancy, educational attainment and earnings of the Arab minority are on par with, if not better than, that of Arab minorities in virtually all Western European countries, and far above that of other Arabs in the Middle East. In Australia the life expectancy, educational attainment (including basic literacy) and earnings of indigenous Australians is nothing short of appalling, worse than many third world countries.• Popular Culture: An Israeli Christian Arab, Lina Makhoul, won The Voice Israel this year. In contrast, not a single person from a minority religion has won the equivalent Australian Idol.Salma Fiomy-Farij, a hijab-wearing Israeli Muslim Arab, came second in this year's Israeli Master Chef (the winner was a German convert to Judaism).In Australia Master Chef has not had a single winner from a religious or racial minority.THUS BY both legal and practical measures Israel is a less racist country than Australia and as far from apartheid South Africa as any country could possibly be. Israel truly is an un-apartheid state, one of the freest, most open and non-racist societies in the world.The false accusations and Israeli Jew-targeting protests of the Australian BDS movement are not only racist and anti- Semitic, they are also completely hypocritical when Australia has so far to go to overcome its own racist past.

There's been much talk in the last week of exactly what constitutes "inappropriate" professional/academic behavior towards women. After President Obama joked that California Attorney General Kamala Harris is, among other things, the "best-looking" Attorney General in the country, a shitstorm of criticism and backlash of defenses cropped up in the press.
While many asserted that Obama's joke was inappropriate, some female pundits on Fox and Friends as well as CNN columnist Roxanne Jones said that the anger was a severe overreaction. The gist of their argument? "I'd be flattered if the President said I was pretty." (How nice for them!) But we don't really know how Harris herself feels about it: Smartly, she's stayed out of the subsequent debate.
All this begs the question: When do we draw the line between a harmless remark and a sexist statement? And regardless of whether it was meant to be sexist, isn't the offhand objectification of women by a figure in power sort of harmful either way?
Yesterday, Professor He Guangshun of the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies posted a comment he made in class to Weibo (the Chinese Twitter):
It's cruel that girls have to come to class at 8:30 am. They should have more time to put on their makeup and enter the classroom elegantly. That way, encouraged and moved by their beauty, boys would have the drive to work hard.
First of all, I always considered going to any pre-noon class in makeup the same thing as going to the gym in makeup. No, sir. I will carry on the proud co-ed tradition of greasy top-knot and pizza-stained sweatpants, thank you muchly. If the boys were "moved" by anything, it was the fact that I smelled like rum, cigarettes, and one ineffective spritz of Gap Dream. IT'S CALLED BEING LOVELY, PEOPLE. TRY IT.
Second of all, I mean... nothing about this makes sense. Put on makeup, you've got a class full of Beautiful Minds. Put on yoga pants, and you're distracting? Other points of confusion: The fact that Guangshun thought it was OK to say in class. The fact that he thought it was so clever he should put it on the Internet. And, above all, the fact that many people are laughing it off or agreeing with him. Including women.
Part of the reason for this is that Shanghai students, even those who have access to a college education, show a marked disinterest in gender studies education and traditional gender norms are huge. Then again, what's our country's excuse?
On the bright side, I'm all for nixing all 8:30 AM classes. You?

Get out your list, because you can add another application to the tally of legitimate uses of BitTorrent.
Apparently, software updates are getting so big these days that simply downloading them from a server is becoming prohibitively time consuming, especially when the same updates need to be applied to many different machines. A Dutch university has some 6,500 desktop PCs in ten locations, which on occasion need to download 3.5GB worth of different types of updates. That's a handsome 22.2TB in total. In a traditional client-server world, that's some modest lifting.
In fact, INHOLLAND University's IT department used to have almost two dozen servers distributed over the university's locations to serve up these downloads. The school was able to retire 20 of them after adopting a new way to distribute updates: BitTorrent.
The peer-to-peer protocol allows PCs to download most of the updates from each other—the remaining servers are mostly needed to send out the first few copies and then coordinate the up- and downloading. One of the advantages of the BitTorrent protocol is that it uses bandwidth where it can find it: faster links are automatically used more.
Using this technology, updating all 6,500 PCs can be done in less than four hours. Previously, this took four days. Four days down to four hours for the same needs!
Leo Blom of ITeleo, who came up with the idea of using BitTorrent, told Ars, "Let me put it this way: if INHOLLAND wants to migrate to Windows Vista, they only have to send out an image through BT. All 6,500 desktops can be migrated overnight in two hours' time—with one push of a button. It's a real migration killer. Migration used to mean a lengthy and trying process. At INHOLLAND, we took a different approach."
According to TorrentFreak, the university's management team was reluctant to adopt the peer-to-peer technology, but they quickly changed their minds after seeing a demonstration. Students and staff who think they can use the modified BitTorrent client for other purposes will be disappointed to learn that the system is completely locked down.
Remember Mark Boykin? He's the Florida pastor who told a TV reporter that if a Satanist put up a display in a local park, he was going to vandalize it himself. He even showed the reporter the sledgehammer he planned to use.
“It's evil, it's the essence of evil. I will take the responsibility for taking the sledgehammer and knocking it down,” Pastor Boykin said.
It turns out that's all moot now since the Satanist in question, middle school teacher Preston Smith, didn't file an application for a permit to put up his display in Boca Raton's Sanborn Square park. (I asked Smith last week why he missed the deadline, but he never responded to my message.) Either way, there will be no pentagram display in the park this year.
On Monday's episode of TruNews, host Rick Wiles, a right-wing conspiracy theorist, invited Boykin to speak about his opposition to the display, and Boykin spilled the beans on why Smith missed the deadline: His mother was apparently very sick and he needed to travel to go be with her. That caused him to miss the permit application deadline.
But pay attention to how Boykin reacts after telling that story.
BOYKIN: … Well, I learned, as of yesterday, that… well, I learned Wednesday night that there would not be a pentagram because Preston Smith did not fill out the permit in time. WILES: So he missed the deadline. BOYKIN: He missed the deadline! But people thought it was because one of the council members wanted to put up a holiday display. But that's not it. He got word that his mother in Texas is very, very sick — I was told the sickness, but I'm not going to say it, because I'd rather not mention — but very life-threatening disease. He had to hop on a plane and go out there, and he told school officials he probably wouldn't be back until sometime in January, and that's when the pentagram would be taken down. WILES: Wow. BOYKIN: That is the power of God!
They're literally celebrating the life-threatening illness of an old woman because it stopped a non-Christian from exercising his First Amendment rights.
If these guys are inspired by Jesus, Jesus must be a dick.
Wiles chimed in a bit later to say that the “greatest ending” to this controversy would be if Smith's mother was “healed by Jesus Christ” and he ended up converting to Christianity.

The Padres are expected to sign Cuban right-hander Michel Baez, a source said Monday.
Baez, 20, would be the latest to join a record-breaking international class. According to MLB.com, the two sides have agreed to a $3 million bonus. With six months left in the 2016-17 signing period, the Padres already have spent about $35 million in bonuses. Overage taxes will effectively double their total expense.
Baez could make his stateside debut with one of the Padres' Single-A affiliates in 2017. At 6-foot-8, the starting pitching prospect throws a mid-90s fastball and has demonstrated a feel for a breaking ball.
In 2014, Baez played for the same 18-and-under national team as recent Padres signees Jorge Ona and Ronald Bolanos. He pitched in Cuba's top professional league, Serie Nacional, the same year, posting a 5.22 ERA in 16 relief appearances.
As per baseball's new collective bargaining agreement, the Padres will receive a $5.75 million hard caps for international bonuses during the 2017-18 signing period. Because they blew past their 2016-17 allotment, they will be prohibited from signing any individual prospect for more than $300,000 over the next two periods. Those terms provide further incentive for the Padres to continue spending before the current period closes in June.
Shakespeare fans and archaeologists can now join in the exploration of Shakespeare's last home on-line, in a new website launched by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. The brand-new website supports the groundbreaking archaeological exploration of New Place in Stratford-upon-Avon, which began earlier this month in a bid to reveal new information about Shakespeare's later life.
www.digforshakespeare.com has been designed to keep potential visitors, as well as Shakespeare fans throughout the world, up to date with the latest news from the archaeological dig at New Place. The website has been created to keep the dig accessible to visitors young and old, incorporating a clip library with the latest footage of archaeologists at work, interviews with experts and volunteers involved in the dig, and background material about what the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust is hoping to find.
To keep younger visitors entertained, the site also contains a fun game (http://www.digforshakespeare.com/dig-for-shakespeare), where children can literally join in a virtual dig, playing as an archaeologist digging for Shakespeare goodies in the soil below New Place. Each time they make a find, they are rewarded with a quote from a Shakespeare play – and they can also record their scores in a bid to be the top virtual archaeologist –making a visit to digforshakespeare.com fun, challenging and educational!
“ Dig for Shakespeare really is a whole new visitor experience – people can come down to New Place and watch the excavation as it unfolds, or if they are not local, they can keep up to date with the latest news and blogs from the dig via the new website,” explains Director of the Trust, Diana Owen. “The dig has been a real success with visitors, with many of them are keen to find out about the latest discoveries after their visit to the site. The extent of the dig is changing on a daily basis at the moment and this is the perfect way of letting them know what's happening.”
The website will be updated every few days, including blogs from the Birmingham Archaeology team - the archaeologists conducting the dig - as well as the army of volunteers who have signed up to lend a hand with the huge task of excavating the site.
The dig, now into its third week, sees archaeologists exploring three key areas of the site where Shakespeare's final home, New Place, would have stood. Even though it is relatively early days for the dig – which will remain active until September, and open to the public until the end of October – archaeologists have already revealed the brickwork of Shakespeare's bay window, where he may have gazed out whilst writing one of his later plays. Work is also underway to explore what is believed to be the servants' yard – an area between the house and the great garden - that possibly housed rubbish or cess pits.
Visitors can walk along a specially constructed platform around the edge of the digs, where they are literally able to look over the shoulders of archaeologists at work and watch as exciting finds are pulled out of the ground – some of which will not have seen the light of day since Shakespeare himself lived there!
The Dig for Shakespeare at New Place in Stratford-upon-Avon is open to the public daily until the end of August, from 11.00am to 5.00pm (last entry 6.00pm during July & August). For more information, please visit www.digforshakespeare.com or call +44 (0)1789 204016.

Although the Taser™ was invented to give law enforcement a non-lethal alternative to the handgun for subduing uncooperative or even violent suspects, more than 500 Americans have been killed by Tasers since their use began to take off in 2001, which is almost one per week. According to a 2008 Amnesty International Report that examined more than 300 deaths, 90% of Taser death victims are unarmed. Tasers and similar stun weapons (also known as Conducted Energy Devices) shoot two barbed metal darts into a person's body, where they deliver a shock of up to 50,000 volts, incapacitating them by disrupting the neuromuscular system. There is no disagreement that being shot with a Taser is generally less injurious and less likely to cause death than being shot with a gun, although the experience is very painful. Further, manufacturer Taser International claims that use of the Taser has saved thousands of lives.
Nevertheless, Taser critics, including international human rights group Amnesty International, point out that 500 Taser-related deaths in ten years constitutes a serious problem, especially when so many of the victims were unarmed. Forty-three year old Allen Kephart , for example, died in May 2011 after police stopped him for an alleged traffic violation in San Bernardino County, California; three officers shocked the unarmed Kephart up to 16 times. In April 2011, Orlando, Florida, police shocked Adam Spencer Johnson, 33, four times with a Taser, in bursts lasting 31, 5, 4 and 5 seconds. An autopsy found that Johnson, who was acting belligerently, but was unarmed, had no drugs or alcohol in his system. Former Boca Raton police chief and Taser expert Andrew J. Scott called the 31-second burst “way too much.” Although the 9th Circuit Medical's Examiner's autopsy report ruled Johnson's death a homicide, the officers were not charged.
Most recently, on March 12, police in Aurora, Illinois, killed 37-year-old Jersey Green with a Taser gun after he jumped on the hoods of parked cars and approached police in an aggressive manner. Green was unarmed.
Critics like Amnesty International are not calling for Tasers to be banned, but for new, more restrictive rules on their use, and the freewheeling era of Taser use may be coming to an end. The police in Montpellier, Vermont, recently withdrew a request to purchase Tasers after heated public opposition , and in July 2011 a jury in Charlotte, North Carolina, awarded damages of $10 million against Taser International in a case arising out of Taser use by Charlotte police on a 17-year-old boy. The City of Charlotte had previously paid the family $625,000 in a settlement.

Taser Deaths on the Rise (by Noel Brinkerhoff, AllGov)
On our most recent trip to Portland, I noticed that it doesn't seem to matter whether you go out to a fine dining restaurant or a hole in the wall, you're always served by the same bearded, bike-riding douche who would be much happier if you weren't harshing his mellow by being a customer. Hence, a new game: Portland Waitstaff Bingo. In order to get Bingo, one line of items must be present on a server in the restaurant, not necessarily all on your server.
Not pictured here: “doesn't seem to know what's on the menu”, “could easily be mistaken for homeless person”, “ironic t-shirt”, “sweater knitted from cat hair”, “clearly high at the moment”, “is so vegan, he/she is visibly angry with you for ordering animal products”, and “wearing at least six layers of tops and skirts, all made from hemp”.
We went to one restaurant where I could have covered the board.

Building a brain sounds like a worthy goal, one that makes it seem as though the future is within reach. Figuring out how our pesky old brains actually work has lots of potential benefits: We could learn more efficiently, cure mental illnesses, or even build smart robots. So last year, the European Union decided, Why not? And the Human Brain Project was born. The EU's project inspired a similar effort in the United States, called the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.
In the past few days, more than 500 scientists have said, essentially, Here's why not. They petitioned the European Commission to make major changes to the HBP, a collaborative initiative to “simulate the brain” in the next 10 years. The project is anticipated to cost more than 1 billion euros, and will be funded jointly by the European Commission and private research institutions.
This is a Herculean task: The brain contains billions of brain cells called neurons, which connect and communicate with one another through trillions of structures called synapses. The HBP's goal is to map all of these neurons and synapses so that it can build a computer model of the brain. Using that model brain, the logic goes, scientists can learn more about human thought as well as neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's.
Similarly, the United States' BRAIN Initiative aims to discover “how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space.” Government agencies have invested $100 million for the 2014 fiscal year, and it was just announced this week that the Department of Defense is investing $40 million in the project.
In their open message, the scientists raised concerns that the HBP has to narrow a focus to achieve progress in neuroscience research.* The petition was, in part, a reaction to the HBP's decision last month to shut down the Cognitive Architectures division of the HBP plan, one of the few modules that focused on broader questions such as memory and decision-making, rather than synaptic-level research. Scientists are requesting more transparency in the HBP's decisions, and they call for the project to “reallocate the funding currently allocated to the HBP core … to broad neuroscience-directed funding.” (The HBP's board of directors and executive committee issued an official response in which they said they were “saddened” by the petition; the four-page note reiterates the importance of the project but does little to address scientists' specific concerns.)
The HBP's leader, neuroscientist Henry Markram, dismisses the naysayers as just averse to change and worried that their labs aren't going to get funded. Markram's management style appears to be one reason scientists created the petition; Zachary Mainen, one of the letter's authors, told Science magazine that the HBP “is not a democracy, it's Henry's game, and you can either be convinced by his arguments or else you can leave.”
There are many good reasons to revamp the goals of the HBP, as well as BRAIN. For one thing, the goals of these projects are unfocused. What it means to “understand the human brain” is undefined. HBP and BRAIN have been compared with the Human Genome Project, but that effort was very straightforward. It had a clear goal: sequencing all base pairs of human DNA. And it had clear methods: When the project began, we already had the basic technical tools necessary to sequence genetic base pairs (although improvements in technique sped up the process).
When the BRAIN Initiative was first announced, neuroscientist Eric Kandel pointed out in an interview with the Daily Beast that for the genome project, “We knew the endpoint,” he said. “But here, we don't know what the goal is. What does it mean to understand the human mind? When will we be satisfied? This is much, much more ambitious.” While Kandel, like many scientists, was excited about the possibilities of the BRAIN Initiative, the undefined goals of BRAIN and HBP mean that they are more susceptible to failure. “I think we're promising too much,” said UCLA neuroscientist David Hovda. “I don't think it's going to be the big breakthrough that people think it will be.”
Another reason BRAIN and HBP are not like the genome project: Your genome does not change from millisecond to millisecond the way a human brain does. What's more, neurons work in dynamic groups, and we don't yet have the technology to track those. Tracking single neurons doesn't tell us much, according to neuroscientists who wrote a 2012 paper that was supposedly the foundational text of the BRAIN Initiative. Doing so would be pointless, write the authors, “just as it would be pointless to view an HDTV program by looking just one or a few pixels on a screen.” Yet this is an explicit goal of BRAIN, which states in grant application information that they're looking to fund “mechanisms linking single cell or circuit activity to hemodynamic or macro-electromagnetic signals.”
In addition to studying individual neurons, HBP and BRAIN focus on brain imaging and computer simulations of neuronal networks. Research in these fields is important, but they are not the only fields that contribute to our understanding of the human brain. They are sexy, however, and that's possibly why they've been chosen as the narrow focus of the infinitely larger goal of “understanding the brain.” For an example of how models and imaging are the face of neuroscience, look no further than National Institutes of Health's website describing the BRAIN Initiative, which displays a photo of a colorful brain with a caption that doesn't describe what the colors mean. On a personal note, I've had family members suggest that I use “more gadgets” such as brain imaging to make my developmental psychology research “more scientific.” Models and imaging provide the veneer of precision; they appear to be objective, quantifiable measures of the brain. Pictures of brain activity: You can't get more scientific than that! We just look at where the brain lights up, and that tells us … what, exactly?
And that's the problem. Researchers aren't really sure. Many brain images you see in the news are from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, which measure blood flow in the brain. The assumption is that there will be more blood flow to parts of the brain that are being used. However, scientists have questioned this simple assumption in recent years. There's also evidence that certain areas of the brain may serve as blood flow directors, which would further weaken the assumption that blood flow represents brain activity.
Of course, studying what we don't yet understand can be valuable, and more funding to pin down what brain images mean could lead to huge advances for neuroscience. But assuming that this type of research is the best way forward in achieving our nebulous goal of understanding the brain is disingenuous and misleading. This promotes a certain type of research as important and fuels public perception of those studies as the “real” science. It's not clear that our pretty brain images tell us more about the human brain than other analyses of human behavior do. This bias also puts institutions that don't have the funding or infrastructure to support imaging studies at a disadvantage —most fMRIs machines cost between $300,000 and $1 million, and even running a study on a single participant costs around $1,000. Scientists who do not do brain-scanning work contribute valuable insights to research about the human brain, but they are unlikely to receive funding from the HBP or BRAIN for their work.
Like many researchers, I'm thrilled that the brain sciences are finally getting their heyday (and funding). But let's not limit ourselves to such a narrow scope; after all, people exist in the world, and measuring their behavior in a scanner kind of contradicts the mission of understanding how people's minds work in their natural states. Leaders at BRAIN and HBP should listen to outside scientists' requests: If we are to achieve the ultimate goal of understanding the brain, BRAIN and HBP need to widen the scope of the research they fund and define incremental goals. The aim of the Human Genome Project was not to “understand the human body”—it set a definable, achievable goal, and it was a rousing success. We should take the comparison with the genome project more seriously and do the same for HBP and BRAIN.
Correction, July 15, 2014: This article originally stated that in their open message, scientists raised concerns about BRAIN as well as HBP. The petition refers only to HBP. (Return.)
On Sunday morning in the Aleppo Governorate's eastern countryside, the Syrian Arab Army's elite special operations division known as the “Tiger Forces” continued their large-scale offensive inside the Deir Hafer Plains, targeting the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham's (ISIS) frontline defenses at the farms surrounding the Air Force Academy facility.
The Tiger Forces – in coordination with the National Defense Forces (NDF) of Aleppo City, Kataebat Al-Ba'ath (Al-Ba'ath Battalions), Hezbollah, and Harakat Al-Nujaba (Iraqi paramilitary) – began their assault at the northern farms surrounding the Air Force Academy facility, capturing them after a violent firefight with the ISIS terrorists entrenched around them.
Following the capture of the northern farms, the Tiger Forces and their allies imposed full control over the Air Force Academy facility, killing over 20 enemy combatants from ISIS, while also seizing a tractor and 3 armored vehicles mounted with 23mm anti-aircraft machine guns.
With the Air Force Academy facility and the village of ‘Aqulah captured, the Tiger Forces and their allies are rolling through the rugged Deir Hafer Plains, while the enemy combatants from ISIS are retreating all over the eastern countryside of Aleppo.
Currently, the Tiger Forces and their allies are pushing towards the village of Humaymah Al-Kabeera (east of Kuweires) and Tal Al-Ahmar (south of Kuweires), where they have been confronted by a large ISIS force – clashes ongoing this morning.

WASHINGTON – An ISIS fighter who reveled in killing Christians now follows Jesus Christ after a “man in white” repeatedly appeared to him in dreams and said, “You are killing my people,” according to a missionary leader.
A worker with the international evangelical group Youth With a Mission, or YWAM, came in contact earlier this year with the ISIS fighter, who, though understandably guarded, confided that he had become a Christian.
He confessed he once had “actually enjoyed” killing Christians, according to Gina Fadely, international director of frontier missions for YWAM.
Fadely revealed the story in an interview May 29 on The Voice of the Martyrs Radio Network, the Christian Post reported.
The ISIS fighter, she said, “told this YWAM leader that he had begun having dreams of this man in white who came to him and said, ‘You are killing my people.”
“And he started to feel really sick and uneasy about what he was doing,” Fadely said.
“The fighter said that just before he killed one Christian, the man said, ‘I know you will kill me, but I give to you my Bible.'” Fadely recounted. “The Christian was killed and this ISIS fighter actually took the Bible and began to read it.”
The free WND special report “ISIS Rising,” by Middle East expert and former Department of Defense analyst Michael Maloof, will answer your questions about the jihadist army threatening the West.
She said that in another dream, Jesus asked the ISIS fighter to follow him, and the ISIS fighter “was now asking to become a follower of Christ and to be discipled.”
Fadely recalled the story in the biblical book of Acts of Saul of Tarsus, a persecutor of Christians who had a dramatic encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus and became known as the Apostle Paul.
“So, who knows? Perhaps this man will be like Saul in the Bible,” she said.
In an interview with WND, VOM spokesman Todd Nettleton, who conducted the radio interview, said that what makes the development “so rare is that this ISIS fighter reached out to another Christian and shared his story.”
“I believe there are secret Christians within ISIS,” Nettleton said. “Maybe the Christians they are persecuting had a chance to share with them. There are secret Christians within ISIS.”
Kevin Sutter, a YWAM director who joined Fadley in the radio interview, said an Arab leader had told him that there is a “spiritual hunger” that is “unprecedented” among Muslims.
“Many people are now following Jesus, but they keep it quiet,” Sutter said. “They haven't gone public about it.”
He said many “even have church in their own home” and will “serve communion to one another as they're watching TV.”
Convert, be taxed or die
ISIS has declared the creation of a caliphate in portions of Syria and Iraq, and garnered pledges of allegiance from Sunni jihadists across North Africa and in other parts of the world.
ISIS fighters have targeted anyone who does not embrace the militant Sunni Wahhabi form of Islam that originated 200 years ago in Saudi Arabia, which secretly continues to help finance ISIS.
ISIS kills all Shiite Muslims in territory it conquers as well as other ethnic minorities such as the Yazidis, whose women and children are being sold into slavery.
ISIS generally does give Christians the choice of converting to Sunni Islam, paying a tax called a jizya or being killed.
ISIS also is known to have killed other Sunni Muslims whom its fighters believe are not devout enough.
In February, ISIS beheaded 21 Coptic Christians in Libya and then in April released a propaganda video showing the beheadings of 30 Egyptian Christians, all of whom opted not to convert or pay the tax.
And now, a U.S. defense official has confirmed ISIS fighters have captured 88 Eritrean Christian refugees in Libya. A spokesman for an Eritrean refugee group said the ISIS jihadists stopped the truck and demanded the Muslims on board identify themselves. Those who claimed adherence to Islam were then asked questions about the Quran.
Nettleton said Christians should not “write off” ISIS fighters “as being out of reach of God's grace and out of reach of God's spirit.”
In the case of the unidentified ISIS fighter, Nettleton said he “reached out, thereby potentially blowing his cover and getting himself killed.”
“He would be told return (to Islam) or be killed,” Nettleton said. “The fact he reached out shows a great deal of courage.”
ISIS generally, however, has not accepted such repentance and has been known to kill those who may have sought to return to Islam, believing they are not faithful enough.
Muslims refer to such conversions as apostasy, which they see as a conscious abandonment of Islamic law, or Shariah, in word and deed.
Listen to the VOM radio interview:
Apostasy
Notable instances of “apostasy” include Rifqa Bary who in 2009 ran away from her Muslim family in Ohio, saying that they had threatened to kill her for converting to Christianity.
Today, she lives in Ohio and has written a book about her ordeal called “Hiding in the Light.”
Bary, a native of Sri Lanka, said that God's love touched her “in such a way where I had to give myself and I couldn't hold back and I had to leave.”
She said that when her family moved to Ohio, she was still a Muslim, but when she was introduced to Christianity, she said she found herself drawn to it because she was able to worship God in a more personal way, not by force, and in a language she was able to understand,” she told Fox News.
“When I was 13, I sought another way and did the really ‘despicable' thing, which was praying to another God,” she said. “I was desperate just to be able to be free to worship Jesus, so I would sneak out sometimes to go to prayer meetings or I would stay up late and read the Bible in the bathroom or find any possible way.”
After her parents found out about her conversion, Bary said she feared for her life and decided to run away.
“I believe I would have been harmed, if not something more,” she said. “I can't say. It wasn't just one decision where I decided to leave. It was an entire life of oppression.”
In another instance, the Telegraph of London reported a woman who used the pseudonym Sofia Allam left the Muslim faith for Christianity and was threatened with death by her father.
Her father declared she had brought shame and humiliation on the family and was “worse than the muck on their shoes.”
Sofia said her father “couldn't have me in the house now that I was a Kaffir (insulting term for non-Muslim).”
“He said I was damned forever. He insulted me horribly,” she said. “I couldn't recognize that man as the father who had been so kind to me as I was growing up.”
She said her mother's transformation was even worse.
“She constantly beat me about the head. She screamed at me all the time. I remember saying to them, as they were shouting death threats, ‘Mum, Dad – you're saying you should kill me, but I'm your daughter. Don't you realize that?'”
Mark Sanchez has no intention of missing the rest of the 2013 season because of the torn labrum in his right shoulder.
The New York Jets quarterback told NFL Media's Rich Eisen on Thursday that he was "pleasantly surprised" by his "progress." Sanchez stated that his plan is to rehab his throwing shoulder and get back on the field.
"I'm rehabbing my ass off to try and make it back, and that's where my head's at," Sanchez told Eisen. "There is no plan for surgery at this time."
After incorrect reports surfaced Thursday that Sanchez was out for the season, it's interesting to hear him now try to get out in front of the story. He's making it clear that he doesn't want the Jets to end his season. Sanchez said he's not angry with the Jets, but he believes he has earned the right to play with a better August performance than rookie quarterback Geno Smith.
"What I'm really disappointed about is that I got hurt because I won the competition," Sanchez said.
"Do you feel you won the competition?" Eisen asked.
"There's no doubt," Sanchez said. "It was a done deal."
That's about as fiery as we've heard Sanchez in a while. As recently as the middle of August, Sanchez publicly said it wasn't up to him to decide who was leading the quarterback competition.
Ultimately, the ability to play now is out of Sanchez's hands. If Smith plays well in Sanchez's absence, it's hard to imagine the Jets pulling the plug on the rookie.
