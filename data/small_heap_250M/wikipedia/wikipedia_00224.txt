Farnworth Town Hall is a municipal building in Market Street, Farnworth, Greater Manchester, England. The town hall, which was the headquarters of Farnworth Borough Council, is a grade II listed building.
History
Shortly after it had been created in 1863, the local board of health established itself in a small office in Darley Street. After population growth associated with the increasing number of local coal mines led to the area becoming an urban district in 1894, civic leaders decided to procure a dedicated town hall: the site they selected was open land between Trafford Street and Rawson Street.
The new building, which was designed by Bradshaw Gass & Hope in the neoclassical style and built in red brick with stone dressings, was officially opened by the chairman of the council, Thomas Stanley, on 30 March 1909. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nine bays facing onto Market Street; the central section of three bays, which slightly projected forward, featured a semi-circular porch with Ionic order columns; there was a three-light mullioned window on the first floor and a Diocletian window flanked by pilasters in the pediment above. The middle bay in the left hand section featured a carved coat of arms on the first floor with a curved pediment above, while the middle bay in the right hand section featured a mullioned window on the first floor with a curved pediment above. At roof level, there was a central cupola. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber and the mayor's parlour, both on the first floor; there was a large stained glass window on the staircase depicting the council coat of arms.
Civic leaders also procured a Carnegie library which was designed by the same architectural firm, built on open land between Carlton Street and Trafford Street (just to the north of the town hall) and completed in 1911. The town hall was subsequently extended to the north to create an additional bay which was set back to maintain the symmetrical form of the building. After the area achieved municipal borough status in 1939, the building became the headquarters of the new borough council but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Bolton Council was formed in 1974. Although the building was subsequently used for community purposes, it subsequently fell into a state of disrepair.
On 2 July 1992, a security guard, Ian Foster, was fatally shot on the front steps of the town hall after being forced to hand over takings he had collected from an office in the building. Two men were subsequently tried and convicted of his murder. After an extensive programme of refurbishment works costing £1.3 million had been completed in June 2013, the building re-opened as additional workspace for the council departments of Bolton Council.

Wireless Valley is a term that was coined by Professor Ted Rappaport in 1990 when he was a faculty member at Virginia Tech, and was used to describe the Roanoke/Blacksburg, Virginia region and the potential of research to create spin-out companies. In 1990 he and his students founded TSR Technologies, a company that made software-defined cellular and paging intercept and drive test equipment that was sold to Allen Telecom in 1993, and in 1995 Wireless Valley Communications, a company that pioneered the creation of computer-aided wireless network prediction and management software that was sold to Motorola in late 2005. This term was later used as nickname to describe several regional clusters of companies in the information technology sector, in analogy to California's Silicon Valley:
One such cluster is located in northern Stockholm, Sweden. This also included a number of companies that saw themselves as belonging to the new information based economy. Ericsson, the telecommunications supplier, has one of its main design centers in the Stockholm suburb of Kista.
Finland also has a high-tech area in Espoo, sometimes called "Wireless Valley", based on Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks. There is a secondary hub located in Oulu which is the base for other wireless specialist companies too.
A third such cluster consists of the telecommunications formed in San Diego, based on Qualcomm
A new high-tech program has been initialed in Nanjing, China, called 'China Wireless valley'. It is based on two national key laboratories of Southeast University.

Christian the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (20 September 1599 – 16 June 1626), a member of the House of Welf, titular Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt, was a German Protestant military leader during the early years of the Thirty Years' War, fighting against the forces of the Imperial House of Habsburg, Habsburg Spain, and the Catholic League.
Life
Christian was born in 1599 at the Gröningen Priory near Halberstadt (in today's Saxony-Anhalt), the third son of Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1564–1613) with his second wife Elizabeth (1573–1626), daughter of the late King Frederick II of Denmark. After his father's death, he was educated by his maternal uncle, King Christian IV of Denmark, and attended the University of Helmstedt. After the death of his brother Rudolf in 1616, Christian, at the age of 17, was elected his successor as Lutheran administrator of the Halberstadt bishopric. Though he did not obtain any confirmation by the Emperor or the Catholic Church, this position provided him the necessary finances to start a military career.
In 1620 Christian joined the army of Prince Maurice of Orange and fought in the Netherlands against a Spanish army. Later he raised his own army and, in liege to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, he carried out three significant battles: the Battle of Höchst (1622), the Battle of Fleurus (1622), and lastly at the Battle of Stadtlohn (1623). He participated in a number of plunderings and burnings along the France-Germany border and throughout the Netherlands. Christian fought alongside the Count of Mansfeld in the first two engagements, and suffered two losses to the Count of Tilly: an arguable one at Höchst, and his final one at Stadtlohn. Christian's major success was at Fleurus, where his actions directly led to the relieving of the Protestant stronghold of Bergen op Zoom. He died childless from wounds sustained in battle in 1626.
Campaigns of 1622-23
In 1621, Christian was one of the few men to continue rallying behind Frederick V, who had only the year before claimed and been deposed from the throne of Bohemia following his crushing loss at the Battle of White Mountain. Frederick was still leader of the Protestant resistance rooted from the 1618 crushed Bohemian Revolution. What attracted Christian to the cause is arguable, but something that may have had to do with it was the fact that before his campaigning, Christian declared a chivalric love for Elizabeth, Frederick's wife and daughter of James I of England, who at this point of the war had sent several thousand troops under Sir Horace Vere to the Palatinate.
By the end of 1621 he had managed to raise 10,000 troops, with whom he wintered in Westphalia, gathering a great treasure from the dioceses of Münster and Paderborn. Christian's military actions began in 1622 when Ernst von Mansfeld began organizing his forces and expressed interest in linking up with his army, especially after his ally Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, was crushingly defeated at the Battle of Wimpfen. They were caught at the Battle of Höchst, 22 June 1622, and although Christian was arguably defeated, he was able to escape with much of his army despite crossing a river under heavy fire and losing all of his baggage. The newly united Protestant army moved into Alsace, leaving Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatinate, to fall to Count von Tilly in September 1622, effectively forcing Frederick V out of the war.
After intense foraging and ravaging of the Alsace region, Christian and Mansfeld moved north in Lorraine, and upon the news of the Spanish siege of Bergen op Zoom, they marched to the relief of the city, fighting the Battle of Fleurus (29 August 1622) and in the midst of the battle, Christian displayed his well-known courage and stubbornness on the field by leading four unsuccessful cavalry charges against the Spanish lines under Fernández de Córdoba. It was on the fifth charge that the Protestant horsemen broke the Spanish lines and paved the way for the Protestant relief of Bergen op Zoom that October. This came at a cost of most of Christian's infantry and one of Christian's arms. Fresh from that victory, Christian spent the winter of 1622–23 in the Spanish Netherlands resting and replenishing his army to what would be in spring 1623 set at roughly 15,000.
Spring 1623 saw a plan between Christian, Mansfeld, the Prince of Transylvania Bethlen Gabor, and his ally Count Thurn to retake Bohemia for the Protestants and to breathe new life into the ailing Protestant cause. The campaign faltered from the start as Count von Tilly received news of the troop movements and positioned himself in Lower Saxony, with reports from Mansfeld coming to Christian that he did not have the money to pay his armies or to campaign, leaving Christian to himself in the north. Outnumbered again, and leading an army that was not as disciplined as that of Tilly, Christian made a break for the relative safety of the United Provinces. He was outrun and outmaneuvered 10 miles short of the Dutch border, and in a stand typical of Christian's bravery, he was nonetheless decisively defeated at the Battle of Stadtlohn on 6 August 1623, when he lost all but 2,000 of this 15,000-man army. Broken, he fled for The Hague with the remnants of his army.
Defeat and death
Christian's defeat signalled the close of the "Palatine Phase" of the Thirty Years' War, and the end of the Protestant rebellion as a whole. Three days after Stadtlohn, Frederick V signed an armistice with Ferdinand II, ending the former's resistance to what seemed as impending Catholic domination of the Holy Roman Empire. Mansfeld shortly thereafter disbanded his army on the Rhine with the entrance of Denmark-Norway, the United Provinces, and England into the war in 1625. Under a plan that involved Christian, Mansfeld, and Christian IV, King of Denmark-Norway, pushing from the United Provinces and from Denmark-Norway, Christian found himself with ample financial backing. Ordered to advance on the Rhineland, he undertook this mission but quickly found himself checked by Tilly in Hesse, and opted this time to retreat rather than fight. Ill from the outset of the campaign, he died at Wolfenbüttel on 16 June 1626 at the age of 26.

The A6030 is a small ring-road entirely within the built-up central area of Leicester, from its roundabout with the A563 near Hamilton, south to cross the A47 at Evington, past Leicester General Hospital and the Leicestershire Golf Club to meet the A6 again at Stoneygate near Oadby.
The road is a useful part of the route from the M1 at its junction with the M69 (M1/J21) to the A47 heading towards Peterborough and beyond, effectively "plugging the gap" in the A563 ring-road between the A6 at Oadby and the A47 at Highfields.
History
The section of road between Gipsy Lane and the A563 was opened in April 2005 to make it easier for traffic to get to Oadby and the A6, otherwise they would have had to use the unfinished A563 to get to Oadby. The small section of road between Red Hill Circle and the A607 still has the 'A6030' road name but the rest of the old road has been downgraded. The stretch between Red Hill Circle and Gypsy Lane was originally the A6 (Loughborough Road).
The A6030 was meant to be the eastern half of the A563 at one stage. At its junction with Hastings Road, where the A6030 effectively turns off to the north, there is a strip of land as far as the railway line (which has now had a housing estate with cul-de-sacs built on it, you can still see where the road would have gone). The A6030 would then have obliterated Canon Street and Ratcliffe Street, continued West over the River Soar, lining up with Corporation Road and then Beaumont Leys Lane. This would then have curved, approximating the later line of Strasbourg Drive, to line up with the western half of the A563.

André Gérardin (1879, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle – 1953, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle) was a French mathematician, specializing in number theory and calculating machines used in factoring large positive integers, finding primes, and calculating quadratic residues modulo a given positive integer.
Gérardin became a member of the Société Mathématique de France in 1906. He wrote many articles for L'Enseignement Mathématique, Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques, and other French mathematical journals, as well as a few articles for foreign mathematical journals. He was one of nine mathematicians who read the initial page proofs and suggested improvements for the first volume of Leonard E. Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers. In that volume, Dickson and Gérardin announced for the first time that the Mersenne number M173 has the factor 730753.
Gérardin was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1912 at Cambridge UK, in 1920 at Strasbourg, in 1928 at Bologna, and in 1932 at Zürich. He was the founder and editor for many years of the mathematical review Sphinx-Oedipe, started in 1906. In 1944 he, along with Paul Belgodère, started the journal Intermédiarie des Recherches Mathématiques. In 1948 Gérardin started publishing the journal Diophante and continued with it until his death.
In 1949, Paul Belgodère, the director (from 1949 to 1986) of the Institut Henri Poincaré, purchased the important mathematical library that Gérardin had accumulated at Nancy.

William Little Frierson (September 3, 1868 – May 25, 1953) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician. During his career he served as the United States Solicitor General (1920–1921), United States Assistant Attorney General (1917–1920), and mayor of Chattanooga, Tennessee (1905–1907).
Biography
Frierson was born on September 3, 1868, in Shelbyville, Tennessee to Robert Payne and Mary (Little) Frierson. He graduated in 1887 from Southwestern Presbyterian University in Clarksville, Tennessee (now Rhodes College. In 1929, Frierson received an honorary law degree from the college in Memphis, Tennessee. He began practicing law in his hometown of Shelbyville in 1889. The following year he moved to Chattanooga, where he worked in various law firms until 1917.
Frierson held a variety of local government positions before being appointed United States Solicitor General. In 1905, Frierson was elected mayor of Chattanooga and held that position until 1907. He served as city attorney from 1912 to 1915. Subsequently, Frierson was named a special justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1916. In 1917, Frierson was appointed United States Assistant Attorney General, a position he held until 1920. During his time as Assistant Attorney General, he was involved in the Hughes Aircraft Investigation, where he questioned witnesses to the production and inspection of timber for American aircraft. In June 1920, President Woodrow Wilson nominated and the Senate confirmed Frierson to be solicitor general. As SG, Frierson made persuasive arguments upholding the National Prohibition Act of 1919, which enforced the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution dealing with the prohibition of alcohol. When the question arose regarding the sale and possession of alcohol by Americans on ships, the Supreme Court agreed with his argument that no liquor could be sold on any U.S. flagged vessels.
After serving as solicitor general, Frierson returned to Chattanooga to be a member of the Williams & Frierson law firm. From 1922 to 1923, he served as president of the Tennessee State Bar Association. William married Margaret (Daniel) on April 20, 1892, with whom he had three children: Margaret Williamson, Robert Payne, and Sue Lawwill. On May 25, 1953, Frierson died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 84.

Barrel of Monkeys is a toy game released by Lakeside Toys in 1965. It was created by Leonard Marks and Milton Dinhofer in 1961, and in 1964, Herman Kesler partnered to sell it to Lakeside Toys. Lakeside Toys released it in 1965 and today it is produced by the Milton Bradley Company within the Hasbro corporation. Milton Bradley's editions consist of a toy barrel in either blue, yellow, red, purple, orange, gray or green. The barrel contains 12 monkeys but can hold 24, their color usually corresponding to the barrel's color. The instructions state, "Dump monkeys onto table. Pick up one monkey by an arm. Hook other arm through a second monkey's arm. Continue making a chain. Your turn is over when a monkey is dropped." In addition to these basic instructions, the barrel also contains instructions for playing alone or with two or more players.
Time magazine ranked Barrel of Monkeys at No. 53 on their 2011 All-Time 100 Greatest Toys list.
History
In 1961, a greeting cards salesman, Leonard Marks, was in a small mom-and-pop shop to sell his line of cards. As he waited for Robert Gilbert, the shop owner, he fiddled with an open box of snow-tire-replacement chain links. Marks became so engrossed in playing, he did not realize how much time had passed. When he told Gilbert that the links would make a great toy, Gilbert referred Marks to Milton Dinhofer, a successful toy inventor in the area. Marks already knew Dinhofer from his high school days and immediately reached out to his old acquaintance. Dinhofer asked Marks to make a plastic sample of the hooks for their meeting.
Milton Dinhofer was a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a successful importer who already had two toy successes to his credit. He created the first full-size wearable toy space helmet which made the covers of both The Saturday Evening Post (November 8, 1952) and Collier's magazine (April 18, 1953). He also designed and brought to market Sip-n-See. Sip-n-See was the first mass-produced twisted plastic drinking straw and sold over 6 million units. The straws had different characters on them, and it was the s-shaped arms of his cowboy straw that inspired the shape of the monkeys's arms.
When Marks met Dinhofer at his home in Roslyn, New York, he brought a pile of red, s-shaped hooks made from 1/4" plastic rod. Dinhofer immediately imagined monkeys having arms positioned like his cowboy character's. Marks and Dinhofer agreed to form a partnership that night. It was decided that Dinhofer would design the toy, and Marks would sell it. It took Dinhofer three months to go from sketch to functional monkey. He made a sketch for a face and one for a body, but the biggest challenge was the monkey's balance. Once that was achieved, Dinhofer hired A. Santore of A. S. Plastic Model Company to carve a sample under his supervision. Dinhofer then searched for a beryllium-mold maker which was quite a challenge and very expensive as working with plastic was still relatively new. The initial run of monkeys is in many assorted colors, but their shape was just like this Lakeside released in 1965. (Lakeside would eventually add a little more hair to the bodies and decades later change the designs completely.) Before Lakeside, the prototype was called Chimp to Chimp. Four of its monkeys were yellow, four were green and four were red. The twelve monkeys allowed three to twelve-year-olds to link them without needing to stand on stools. The Chimp to Chimp prototype came in flat inexpensive packaging which the Woolworth chain offered to carry in their stores. But Woolworth's stipulated that Marks and Dinhofer would have to provide 13 weeks of television advertising which neither could afford. No other buyers were found, and it seemed the game would never come to market. Then, in 1964, Herman Kesler agreed to join the partnership and pitch Barrel of Monkeys to Lakeside Toys where he had connections.
In November of that year, Kesler met with Zelman Levine, the CEO and President of Lakeside Toys at the Essex House in New York City. Also present were Lakeside's vice president, James R. Becker, who would eventually become president, and Stanley Harfenist, Lakeside's future General Manager who was in the process of bringing Gumby to Lakeside. Kesler walked into Levine's room, dropped the monkeys on the table and began to link them together. Becker said it was during the meeting that he brought up the phrase, "more fun than a barrel of monkeys." Levine immediately approved the toy and took all the samples back with him to his headquarters in Minneapolis. Barrel of Monkeys was quickly released in 1965 as a Lakeside toy allowing Marks, Dinhofer and Kesler to receive ongoing royalties. The game was first packaged in a cardboard tube like Lakeside's successful game Pick-Up-Sticks, but with a plastic monkey attached to the lid. The monkeys easily broke off the packaging, and, in 1966, a two-piece plastic barrel was introduced. In April 1967, the game was #2 on Toy and Hobby World's Toy Hit Parade chart.
Lakeside Toys was eventually sold to Leisure Dynamics, Inc. in 1969. Leisure was sold to Coleco Industries in 1985, and Coleco was sold to Hasbro Inc. in 1988 The current Hasbro version is sold with ten newly designed monkeys in the barrel.
Unlike the later mono-colored Giant Barrel of Monkeys, the original version included 12 plastic monkeys in three colors; four each in red, blue and yellow.
Use in models
These Monkeys have also been used for modeling of polyhedral structures, including virus particles and other protein structures
In brief, a pair of monkeys can hook around each other in more than eighty different ways, forming quite stable links. The links may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Repetition of an asymmetric link generates a helix. A symmetric link is self-limiting, so that the structure cannot grow further unless a new link is used to join symmetric pairs. It is possible to generate structures with point, line, 2D or 3D symmetry by choosing two or three different links (from the 80 or more possibilities) and repeating them systematically. An enormous number of compatible combinations can be found by trial and error. Many are shown in the sources quoted above.
Any repeating unit can in principle be assembled in this way. The only unusual characteristic of the monkey is that its arms, legs, hands and feet are able to twist around each other to form many stable links. In this, they resemble protein molecules which can also link together in many ways. The resulting assemblies simulate biologically important structures, but their symmetry follows general geometric principles. The monkeys provide a 'hands on' approach to understanding these principles.
Barrel of Monkeys is also called as Bandar Keela and is famous in south Asian countries.
Media appearances
A Barrel of Monkeys set appears in the Toy Story series of animated films, which takes place in a world in which sentient toys pretend to be lifeless when humans are present. In the films, the monkey toys belonged to the character Andy during his childhood.
In May 2012, Dartmouth College student Parker Phinney led a fundraising group that built a chain of 5,990 monkeys, the longest ever.
In the game show Family Game Night, a show featuring many Hasbro-owned game brands, families play the game for a prize by arranging the chains of monkeys from shortest to longest.
The logos and posters for 1995 film 12 Monkeys and 2015 TV series' borrow Barrel of Monkeys imagery.
In Iron Man 3, Tony Stark likens an air rescue to playing Barrel of Monkeys.

Drawing heavily from the occult beliefs of artist Austin Osman Spare, chaos magic has been characterised as an invented religion, with some commentators drawing similarities between the movement and Discordianism.
The founding figures of chaos magic believed that other occult traditions had become too religious in character. They attempted to strip away the symbolic, ritualistic, theological or otherwise ornamental aspects of these occult traditions, to leave behind a set of basic techniques that they believed to be the basis of magic.
Chaos magic teaches that the essence of magic is that perceptions are conditioned by beliefs, and that the world as we perceive it can be changed by deliberately changing those beliefs. Chaos magicians subsequently treat belief as a tool, often creating their own idiosyncratic magical systems and frequently borrowing from other magical traditions, religious movements, popular culture and various strands of philosophy.
Hugh Urban has described chaos magic as a union of traditional occult techniques and applied postmodernism – particularly a postmodernist skepticism concerning the existence or knowability of objective truth.
Concept and terminology
Chaos magic rejects the existence of absolute truth, and views all occult systems as arbitrary symbol-systems that are only effective because of the belief of the practitioner.
Beliefs and general principles
Belief as a tool
The central defining tenet of chaos magic is arguably the idea that belief is a tool for achieving effects. In chaos magic, complex symbol systems like Qabalah, the Enochian system, astrology or the I Ching are treated as maps or "symbolic and linguistic constructs" that can be manipulated to achieve certain ends but that have no absolute or objective truth value in themselves. Religious scholar Hugh Urban notes that chaos magic's "rejection of all fixed models of reality" reflects one of its central tenets: "nothing is true everything is permitted".
Both Urban and religious scholar Bernd-Christian Otto trace this position to the influence of postmodernism on contemporary occultism. Another influence comes from the magical system of Austin Osman Spare, who believed that belief itself was a form of "psychic energy" that became locked up in rigid belief structures, and that could be released by breaking down those structures. This "free belief" could then be directed towards new aims. Otto has argued that chaos magic "filed away the whole issue of truth, thus liberating and instrumentalising individual belief as a mere tool of ritual practice."
Magical paradigm shifting
Peter J. Carroll suggests assigning different worldviews to the sides of a die, and then inhabiting a particular random paradigm for a set length of time (a week, a month, a year, etc.), depending on which number is rolled. For example, 1 might be paganism, 2 might be monotheism, 3 might be atheism, and so on.
Phil Hine has stated that the primary task here is "to thoroughly decondition" the aspiring magician from "the mesh of beliefs, attitudes and fictions about self, society, and the world" that his or her ego associates with:
Our ego is a fiction of stable self-hood which maintains itself by perpetuating the distinctions of "what I am/what I am not, what I like/what I don't like", beliefs about ones politics, religion, gender preference, degree of free will, race, subculture etc all help maintain a stable sense of self.
Practices
Cut-up technique
The cut-up technique is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged, often at random, to create a new text. The technique can also be applied to other media: film, photography, audio recordings, etc. It was pioneered by Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs.
Burroughs – who practiced chaos magic, and was inducted into the chaos magic organisation The Illuminates of Thanateros in the early 1990s – was adamant that the technique had a magical function, stating "the cut ups are not for artistic purposes". Burroughs used his cut-ups for "political warfare, scientific research, personal therapy, magical divination, and conjuration" – the essential idea being that the cut-ups allowed the user to "break down the barriers that surround consciousness". Burroughs stated:
I would say that my most interesting experience with the earlier techniques was the realization that when you make cut-ups you do not get simply random juxtapositions of words, that they do mean something, and often that these meanings refer to some future event. I've made many cut-ups and then later recognized that the cut-up referred to something that I read later in a newspaper or a book, or something that happened... Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.
David Bowie compared the randomness of the cut-up technique to the randomness inherent in traditional divinatory systems, like the I Ching or Tarot.
Genesis P-Orridge, who studied under Burroughs described it as a way to "identify and short circuit control, life being a stream of cut-ups on every level. They are a means to describe and reveal reality and the multi-faceted individual in which/from which reality is generated."
History
Origins and influences (1900–1982)
Austin Osman Spare's work in the early to mid 1900s is largely the source of chaos magical theory and practice. Specifically, Spare developed the use of sigils and the use of gnosis to empower them. Although Spare died before chaos magic emerged, he has been described as the "grandfather of chaos magic". Working during much the same period as Spare, Aleister Crowley's publications also provided a marginal yet early and ongoing influence, particularly for his syncretic approach to magic and his emphasis on experimentation and deconditioning. Later, concurrent with the growth of religions such as Wicca in the 1950s and 1960s, different forms of magic became more common, some of which came in "explicitly disorganized, radically individualized, and often quite 'chaotic' forms". In the 1960s and the decade that followed, Discordianism, the punk movement, postmodernism and the writings of Robert Anton Wilson emerged, and they were to become significant influences on the form that chaos magic would take.
During the mid-1970s chaos magic appeared as "one of the first postmodern manifestations of occultism", built on the rejection of a need to adhere to a "single, systematized convention", and aimed at distilling magical practices down to a result-oriented approach rather than following specific practices based on tradition. An oft quoted line from Peter Carroll is "Magic will not free itself from occultism until we have strangled the last astrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master."
Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin are considered to be the founders of chaos magic, although Phil Hine points out that there were others "lurking in the background, such as the Stoke Newington Sorcerors". Carroll was a regular contributor to The New Equinox, a magazine edited by Sherwin, and thus the two became acquainted.
In 1976-77 the first chaos magic organization The Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT) was announced. The following year, 1978, was a seminal year in the origin of chaos magic, seeing the publication of both Liber Null by Carroll and The Book of Results by Sherwin – the first published books on chaos magic.
According to Carroll, "When stripped of local symbolism and terminology, all systems show a remarkable uniformity of method. This is because all systems ultimately derive from the tradition of Shamanism. It is toward an elucidation of this tradition that the following chapters are devoted.
Development and spread (1982–1994)
New chaos magic groups emerged in the early 1980s – at first, located in Yorkshire, where both Sherwin and Carroll were living. The early scene was focused on a shop in Leeds called The Sorceror's Apprentice, owned by Chris Bray. Bray also published a magazine called The Lamp of Thoth, which published articles on chaos magic, and his Sorceror's Apprentice Press re-released both Liber Null and The Book of Results, as well as issuing Psychonaut and The Theatre of Magic. The "short-lived" Circle of Chaos, which included Dave Lee, was formed in 1982. The rituals of this group were published by Paula Pagani as The Cardinal Rites of Chaos in 1985.
Ralph Tegtmeier (Frater U∴D∴), who ran a bookshop in Germany and was already practicing his own brand of "ice magick", translated Liber Null into German. Tegtmeier was inducted into the IOT in the mid-1980s, and later established the German section of the order.
As chaos magic spread, people from outside Carroll and Sherwin's circle began publishing on the topic. Phil Hine, along with Julian Wilde and Joel Biroco, published a number of books on the subject that were particularly influential in spreading chaos magic techniques via the internet.
In 1981, Genesis P-Orridge established Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY). P-Orridge had studied magic under William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin in the 1970s, and was also influenced by Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare, as well as the psychedelic movement. TOPY practiced chaos magic alongside their other activities, and helped raise awareness of chaos magic in subcultures like the Acid House and Industrial music scenes. Along with being an influence on P-Orridge, Burroughs was himself inducted into the IOT in the early 1990s.
Pop culture: (1994–2000s)
From the beginning, chaos magic has had a tendency to draw on the symbolism of pop culture in addition to that of traditional magical systems; the rationale being that all symbol systems are equally arbitrary, and thus equally valid – the belief invested in them being the thing that matters. The symbol of chaos, for example, was lifted from the fantasy novels of Michael Moorcock.
Preluded by Kenneth Grant – who had studied with both Crowley and Spare, and who had introduced elements of H.P. Lovecraft's fictional Cthulhu mythos into his own magical writings – there was a trend for chaos magicians to perform rituals invoking or otherwise dealing with entities from Lovecraft's work, such as the Great Old Ones. Hine, for example, published The Pseudonomicon (1994), a book of Lovecraftian rites.
From 1994 to 2000, Grant Morrison wrote The Invisibles for DC Comics' Vertigo imprint, which has been described by Morrison as a "hypersigil": "a dynamic miniature model of the magician's universe, a hologram, microcosm or 'voodoo doll' which can be manipulated in real time to produce changes in the macrocosmic environment of 'real' life." Both The Invisibles and the activities of Morrison themself were responsible for bringing chaos magic to a much wider audience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the writer outlining their views on chaos magic in the "Pop Magic!" chapter of A Book of Lies (2003) and a Disinfo Convention talk.
Morrison's particular take on chaos magic exemplified the irreverent, pop cultural elements of the tradition, with Morrison arguing that the deities of different religions (Hermes, Mercury, Thoth, Ganesh, etc.) are nothing more than different cultural "glosses" for more universal "big ideas" – and are therefore interchangeable: both with each other, and with other pop culture icons like The Flash, or Metron, or Madonna.
Post-chaos magic: 2010s
Alan Chapman – whilst praising chaos magic for "breathing new life" into Western occultism, thereby saving it from "being lost behind a wall of overly complex symbolism and antiquated morality" – has also criticised chaos magic for its lack of "initiatory knowledge": i.e., "teachings that cannot be learned from books, but must be transmitted orally, or demonstrated", present in all traditional schools of magic.

The Salonika Incident was a major diplomatic incident that broke out on 6 May 1876 after a mob murdered the consuls of France and Germany in the Ottoman city of Thessaloniki (then known as Salonika), Jules Moulin and Henry Abbott. After a young woman of Bulgarian and Christian origin, convert to Islam was kidnapped by a group of Christian men. An enraged mob attempted to retrieve the woman, and murdered Moulin and Abbott when it failed to find her. A diplomatic backlash ensued, leading to displays of force and to reforms in the Ottoman Empire.
Background
In the 1820s, a number of incidents leading to the death of Christians occurred in the Ottoman Empire, notably the Constantinople massacre of 1821, marking the European opinion. The exactions of the bashi-bazouk compounded this sentiment in the following decades. On 15 June 1858, rioting in Jeddah, believed to have been instigated by a former police chief in reaction to British policy in the Red Sea, led to the massacre of 25 Christians, including the British and French consuls, members of their families, and wealthy Greek merchants, yielding a two-day retaliation bombardment from the British frigate HMS Cyclops. The declining Ottoman Empire was also relying more and more on European investment and loans even for daily expenditure, which the European public opinion resented as it was perceived that the funds were squandered in inefficient projects and in corruption, contributing to the poor image of the Empire. Finally, the Sublime Porte was entering a period of such political instability that 1876 would become known as the "Year of Three Sultans".
At that time, a Bulgarian notable, Pericles Hajji Lazzaro, acted as US Consul in Thessaloniki (Salonika). The German consul in Thessaloniki was Sir Henry Abbott, a British subject of Orthodox Christian faith. His brothers were George Abbott and Alfred Abbott. The French consul was Jules Moulin. Jules Moulin had married Henry Abbott's sister, and they were thus all tied by familial links.
On 3 May 1876, a 16-year-old woman named Stephana, was abducted by several women. Stephana, from Bogdanitsa, near Gevgelija, was of Bulgarian and Christian heritage, but had converted to Islam against the will of her family. Stephana associated with a neighbouring Turkish and Muslim family, which took her in their home and proposed to bring her to Thessaloniki in order to complete administrative paperwork that would officially enact her conversion to Islam. To do so, Ottoman law required the convert to appear before a local council and testify that they were embracing Islam freely, as a sane adult and without coercion. The Turks gave Stephana a traditional attire, comprising a full coat and a veil, and brought her to Gevgelija where she would take the train to Thessaloniki. When the train stopped at Karasuli, Stephana's mother Maria was there and recognised her daughter, whom she tried to convince not to follow through with her conversion to Islam.
The train arrived at Thessaloniki in the morning of 5 May. As Stephana asked policemen to escort her to the governor's residence, her mother called for help from Christian bystanders; as the day was a Greek holiday, a 150-strong group of Christians happened to be at the station, including George Abbott, and they attacked Stephana's companions. They seized her, removed her traditional Turkish clothes, put her in a carriage and took her to Hajji Lazzaro's residence.
On the next day, a mob gathered to demand that the Consul hand over Stephana to them.
Incident
In the morning of 6 May, a crowd started assembling in front of the Governor's residence. As rumours ran wild, people grew restless, prompting the Chief of Police, Colonel Salim Bey, to call for the crowd to calm down and disperse. The authorities attempted bring calm by claiming that Stephana would be freed shortly, but as the hours passed and the Governor remained empty-handed, the crowd turned into an angry mob, with calls for marching on the US Consulate and free Stephana by force.
Around 15:00 on 6 May, the consuls of France and Germany, Abbott and Moulin, learned of the commotion in the city. They decided to go to the governor, Mehmed Refet Pasha, either to further negotiate about the conversion of Stephana or to assess the situation on the ground. Abbott and Moulin found themselves surrounded by the mob, and taken to a building adjacent to a mosque, where they found a precarious refuge from the crowd, and the very relative protection of a handful of policemen. Abbott then wrote a letter to Hajji Lazzaro, urging him to release Stephana immediately, but the mob stopped the messenger and destroyed the letter. Seeing that the letter was ineffectual and that the authorities had no assistance forthcoming either from the artillerymen of the citadel or from the marines of the ironclad Iclaliye at anchor in the harbour, Abbott wrote a second message to his brother.
Meanwhile, the British Consul, J.E. Blunt, learning of the ongoing incident, sent a message of his own to Abbott's brothers, and rushed to the scene of the incident. There, witnessing the severity of the situation, he writes another message to Hajji Lazzaro, also urging him to lead Stephana to the mosque.
After three quarters on an hour, the mob started breaking into the room where the consuls where surrounded, by dislodging the iron bars that protected the windows. The crowd invaded the building, broke into the room and lynched Abbott and Moulin with these very iron bars, in front of Mehmed Refet Pasha, Salim Bey and a few policemen, who were helpless in protecting the consuls. The corpses were further mutilated after the two men were killed.
Soon afterwards, policemen arrived, escorting Stephana. When the rioters confirmed her identity, the crowd dispersed. The mob thus ceased to threaten the Christian quarters of the city, and allowed the Pasha to extend his protection to Hajji Lazzaro. Blunt telegraphed the news of the incident and of the murders to the British embassy in Constantinople and, warning that the local authorities did not have the necessary forces to maintain order, requested the protection of the Royal Navy.
Aftermath
The governments of Europe instrumentalised the incident to embarrass the Ottoman Empire, issuing an ultimatum demanding improvements in the security of foreigners, as well as harsh and swift punishment for those responsible. Warships deployed in the Mediterranean as a show of force to back the demands.
By 14 May, the port of Thessaloniki harboured the Ottoman warships Edirne, Iclaliye, Selimiye, Sahir and Muhbîr-i Surure; the Greek and Vasilefs Georgios; the French Gladiateur and Châteaurenault; the British HMS Bittern and Swiftsure; the Russian Ascold; and the Italian , and well as another Italian gunboat.
The Sultan replaced Refat Pasha with Sherif Pasha as governor, and sent troops in to maintain order. They arrested 50 people, of whom six were publicly executed without a trial. Several public officers were demoted and some were sentenced to hard labour. The Ottoman Empire furthermore paid 40 000 English pound compensations to the families of the victims.

The Kimball Public Library is the public library serving Randolph, Vermont. It is located at 67 Main Street, just north of the town center, in an architecturally distinguished building donated by Col. Robert Kimball, a Randolph native. Built in 1902, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
Architecture and history
The Kimball Public Library stands north of Randolph's commercial downtown, on the east side of Main Street, next door to the Chandler Music Hall. It is a single-story masonry structure, set on a sloping lot that exposes a full basement to the rear. The foundation is rusticated granite, and the main structure is faced in brick with sandstone trim. The building is capped by gabled roof with a dome at its center. The main facade is symmetrical, with a tall projecting gabled section at the center, sheltering the main entrance under a large Romanesque rounded arch. This section is flanked on either side by banks of three sash windows, each topped by stained-glass transoms. The interior retains many original features, including woodwork, brickwork, marble wainscoting, terrazzo marble flooring, and moulded finish elements.
The construction of this building was funded by Colonel Robert Kimball, who was born and raised in Randolph, and found financial success as a banker in New York City. Kimball maintained a summer residence in the town, and, like many philanthropists of the period, recognized the need for the town to have a dedicated space for its library collection. He agreed to fund this building's construction, on land provided by the town. It was designed by Henry M. Francis & Sons of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and was completed in 1902.

Kilroy Bluff () is an ice-covered bluff, high, on the west side of Nursery Glacier at the junction with Jorda Glacier in the Churchill Mountains of Antarctica. The east face of the feature is indented by twin cirques that resemble eyes. Under certain light conditions the appearance of the bluff is reminiscent of the ubiquitous graffiti of World War II: a caricature of a head peering over a wall and the message "Kilroy was here".

Unitarian Universalist Church of Kent, Ohio is a Unitarian Universalist ("UU") church in Kent, Ohio. Founded in 1866, the current building was completed by builder Joseph Gridley (1820-1902) in 1868 on land donated by philanthropist Marvin Kent and rests on a bedrock of sandstone. Its 19 founding members were among the major movers and shakers of the then Village of Franklin Mills, and included abolitionists and Civil War veterans. They were: Dr. Aaron M. Sherman, M.D., who served as a Civil War surgeon (“contract surgeon” for the 46th Ohio Volunteer Infantry and who was stationed at “Lincoln General Hospital” in Washington, D.C.), a prominent civic promoter, served many terms on the local school board, co-founded the Rockton Masonic Lodge that occupies the historic 1883 summer home of Marvin Kent on West Main Street, served as a State Representative in the Ohio State House of Representatives and whose 1858 home first built by Zenas Kent (father of Marvin) for his daughter Frances and her husband George Wells was recently saved, moved and restored by local historic preservation activists, Arvin Olin, Ransom Olin, Nelson Olin, Joseph Stratton, who, in 1882, donated the large bell that is in the church belfry, Phillip Boosinger, Mary Boosinger, Rhoda Boosinger, James D. Haymaker (son of Frederick Haymaker, member of a family who had strong abolitionist leanings and a business partner of abolitionist John Brown, who resided in Kent for a time) and Mary Rosetta Olin Haymaker, J.G. Whitcomb, T.H. Marshall, Eliza Wright, A. Merrell, Almund Russell (a member of a prominent Franklin Mills abolitionist family), Sybil Bradley, Effie Parsons, Mary J. Parsons and Mary A. Furry. These 19 men and women gathered on May 27, 1866 to write and sign the church's constitution in the historic 1836 Village Hall that would serve as an early place of worship before the church building was completed next door in 1868. It is the only church still using its original 19th century building in the city of Kent and in 1976 the site was designed as a "significant restored building site". In the early and middle twentieth century when there were few women clergy anywhere in the United States, the church is notable for having several women ministers: Abbie Danforth in 1889, Carlotta Crosley in 1903, and Violet Kochendoerfer in 1972. Membership is between 140 and 200 full-time adults as well as 100 children in its religious education programs. The church runs a summer camp called Kent Hogwarts which is a Harry Potter-themed camp for young kids, which emphasizes chemistry, poetry, singing and community service. The church advocates social justice, environmental awareness, democracy and acceptance of diverse peoples including all religions. The Kent church follows the seven basic principles of Unitarian Universalism.
The church hosts funeral and memorial services, concerts including classical and jazz music, public meetings on local issues, speeches advocating democracy, and other community events. It holds an annual book sale. In 2016, Rev. Melissa Carvill-Ziemer led the church on a course of structural expansion, seeking variances to expand its physical size. As part of a renovation project, the ceiling of the sanctuary will be removed to expose the vaulted beams from the earlier roof as well as a stained glass window.
Reverend Carvill-Ziemer was appointed chief minister in 2005. In 2010, the church ordained Rev. Renee Ruchotzke and appointed her as its Affiliated Community Minister.
Church leaders have advocated against racism, and marched with other interfaith leaders for racial justice. According to a demographic analysis by Google, the city of Kent is the "most racist" in northeastern Ohio. Carvill-Ziemer advocated against white privilege. In 2010, Ziemer and fellow Unitarian Universalists from Kent traveled to Arizona to protest the state's immigration legislation; she was arrested in Phoenix for allegedly blocking traffic in front of a sheriff's office. A judge later found her not guilty and she was released.
The church has a long history of social action. In 1900, minister Abbie Danforth created and led the Portage County suffrage association and chaired a two-day conference on women's suffrage. Danforth had studied at Canton Theological School and had been ordained in 1878, just 15 years after suffragist Olympia Brown, who was the first woman ever to be ordained in the United States. In the late 1960s, the church served as a site for a local food co-op that later became the Kent Natural Foods Co-op.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the church was active in the anti-war movement. After the May 4, 1970 shootings on the Kent State University campus, the church:
refused to pay its telephone tax.
defied Mayor Leroy Satrom and County Prosecutor Ron Kane's order forbidding more than five people to meet by holding a memorial service for the slain students.
passed resolutions censuring President Nixon, demanding civil liberties from the mayor and county prosecutor, and demanding the immediate withdrawal of troops from Southeast Asia.

Carbophenothion also known as Stauffer R 1303 as for the manufacturer, Stauffer Chemical, is an organophosphorus chemical compound. It was used as a pesticide for citrus fruits under the name of Trithion. Carbophenothion was used as an insecticide and acaricide. Although not used any more it is still a restricted use pesticide in the United States. The chemical is identified in the US as an extremely hazardous substance according to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
Introduction and History
Carbophenothion is a highly toxic organophosphate insecticide and acaricide. Organophosphates are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and disrupt the signal transduction at the cholinergic synapse. It is classified as Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Carbophenothion is used in different brands like Trithion. This pesticide contains 80% carbophenothion as its only active ingredient. Because of the widespread use of those organophosphates in the nineties in the US, it was the most common cause of agricultural poisonings.
An example of the toxicity of carbophenothion was the poisoning of seven family members. The flour which they used in their food was probably contaminated with carbophenothion. The members became ill four to six hours after ingestion. The symptoms were nausea and vomiting, besides this one family member lost his consciousness. All the family members regained full strength after six days.
Since carbophenothion is highly toxic, it may only be used by certified applicators and the people directly supervised by them. A two-day safety waiting interval between the application is required to prevent unnecessary skin exposure. The compound is synthetically produced. The pure compound is a colorless to yellow-brown liquid, and is soluble in most industrial solvents. It is miscible with most organic compounds, like alcohols, ketones and esters.
In 1972 carbophenothion was evaluated at the Joint Meeting of Pesticide Residues (JMPR). During this meeting temporary tolerances were recommended for food, like several fruits, nuts and milk in the form of an acceptable daily intake (ADI). In 1975 these tolerances were re-evaluated and because the data on which the ADI's were based was not available the ADI's were withdrawn. The use of carbophenothion at that time did not indicate a need for additional maximum residue limits for crops, compared to the meeting in 1972. The latest meeting of the JMPR about this compound took place in 1980.
Structure and Properties
Carbophenothion is an aromatic organophosphate with a chloride attached. It appears at room temperature as a colorless to yellow-brown liquid. It has a mild mercaptan-like odor (rotten eggs). Its boiling point is 82 °C and its melting point is unknown. It is relatively stable to heat (below 82 °C).
Carbophenothion is lipophilic and therefore insoluble in water. It is non-corrosive but can be oxidized to phosphorothioate. Carbophenothion can be degraded in the atmosphere by a reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The half life of this reaction is estimated to be about two hours. This reaction does not occur very often, due to the low vapor pressure of carbophenothion (3.0 × 10−7 mm Hg at 20 °C). It is not susceptible to direct photolysis because it absorbs very little UV light and none above 310 nm. A more important fate may be hydrolysis.
Synthesis
Carbophenothion can be synthesized in two steps from 4-chlorothiophenol, hydrogen chloride, formaldehyde and sodium O,O-diethyl dithiophosphate. First 4-chlorothiophenol can react with hydrogen chloride and formaldehyde to chloromethyl-4-chlorophenylsulfide. In the second step chloromethyl-4-chlorophenylsulfide reacts with sodium O,O-diethyl dithiophosphate to carbophenothion and sodium chloride. Both reactions occur spontaneously and are shown in the figure below.
Mechanism of Action
Carbophenothion's mechanism of action is the same as its mechanism of toxicity, which acts through inhibition of cholinesterase, an essential enzyme in the production of neurotransmitters containing choline-based esters (for example acetylcholine). Inability to produce these neurotransmitters causes failure in neuron cell signal transduction. This has widespread effects (see adverse effects) and can be lethal.
Effectiveness of carbophenothion is enhanced by its very long residual activity and easy uptake by insects. Carbophenothion's mainly lipophilic character causes it to linger on the plants it is applied on and in the surrounding ground for extended periods of time. This makes it effective against eggs laid on treated plants. Another advantage of its lipophilic character is that it readily enters insects through sheer contact.
Metabolism
The metabolism of carbophenothion in human beings, is comparable to the metabolism in mice, insects and plants. There is little data of the quantitative degradation of carbophenothion to oxidative and hydrolytic compounds in mammals. It was found that in the rat more than 75% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hours. Carbophenothion is therefore estimated to be rapidly excreted in humans as well. The compound is most toxic when it is not metabolized. The acute toxicity of the majority of the metabolites of carbophenothion have been studied in rats. They are considerably less toxic and thus show that metabolism of carbophenothion does probably not involve bioactivation but rather detoxification. The two main products of this metabolism are sulphoxide and sulphone. Five oxidative products have been identified: the oxygen analogue of the carbophenothion, the sulphoxide and its oxygen analogue and finally sulphones and its oxygen analogue, all of which are depicted on the right.
The first major route of degradation of carbophenothion in rats is sulfoxidation, as displayed on the right. This product can be further transformed into 4-chlorobenzenesulphinic and 4-chlorobenzenesulphonic acid. A second major route involves the formation of 4-chlorothiophenol, which is further transformed via methylation and ring-hydroxylation to 4-Chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl methyl sulfone. This is then converted in approximately equal proportions to sulphate and glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, there are metabolites that presumably arise from the cleavage of the P-S bond such as 4-chlorophenylsulphinylmethyl methyl sulphone. An overview of the metabolites and their occurrence as has been studied in rats can be found in the table below.
One study on rats found that during 48 hours 66% of the administered carbophenothion was excreted in the urine and according to other experiments it takes approximately six days before complete excretion was achieved. Other studies say that even after 14 days there was a detectable level of the oxidation product present.
Efficacy and Adverse Effects
Efficacy
Carbophenothion is used as an insecticide and acaricide, which main use is to protect citrus fruit, but it is also used to protect cotton against aphids (plant lice) and spider mites. Furthermore, it is used in combination with petroleum as well to function as a pesticide against numerous other pests on fruits, nuts, vegetables, sorghum, maize and others. Besides this it is used to control parasites on animals. Trithion, garrathion and lethox are three examples of pesticide brands that work with carbophenothion (Trithion is carbophenothion).
Adverse Effects
Effects on humans
Humans exposed to carbophenothion show a wide variety of symptoms. It produces illness typical of cholinesterase inhibitors. Vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and excessive salivation are some common examples. When someone is exposed via inhalation, he or she may suffer from rhinorrhea and a tight feeling in the chest. As carbophenothion affects the activity of the nerves and the brain, symptoms like mental confusion, profound weakness and drowsiness are observed as well. When someone is exposed by absorption through the skin, they get muscle contractions as well. The only long-term effect found in humans so far is a reduction of the amount of red blood cells and increase of the adrenal gland. These last two phenomenons only have been found in females. Other studies on long-term effects only have been performed on animals and statements about possible extrapolations have not been made so far.
Effects on Animals
Carbophenothion is not only very toxic to humans, but to other animals as well. For a lot of different animals the LD50, the dose at which 50% of the animals died, is determined. In the table below the LD50 for certain types of birds and aquatic organisms are stated. It is highly toxic for crustaceans, marine organisms, amphibians, bees, wildlife as well, but no exact values are known.
Long term effects were examined as well. Exposure of carbophenothion has a negative effect on reproductivity, at least in rats. When a dose of carbophenothion of 1–2 mg/kg/day was given to three following generations, this resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased rat pups' survival. Furthermore, a study on 10-14 adult hens who were given a daily dose of carbophenothion for 24 days showed signs of cholinergic influence, e.g. ataxia, salivation and diarrhoea, loss of body weight and hampered egg production.
Toxicity
Carbophenothion can be absorbed into the body by inhalation of its aerosol, through the skin and by ingestion. Exposure via ingestion is highly toxic, but absorption through the skin is nearly as toxic. Acute toxicity happens as most effects occur soon after uptake in the body. Carbophenothion affects the nervous system by inhibiting cholinesterase. There are no signs of chronic or carcinogenic effects.
The EPA has classified carbophenothion as Category I - highly toxic. The toxicity in man has not yet been studied very well. There has been one study where five people were administrated carbophenothion 0.8 mg/kg/day for 30 days. There were no effects reported on plasma or red blood cell cholinesterase activity. These results were insufficient to determine the ADI. Later on, these results were even questioned because of an experiment with dogs which proved that a dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day already had effects. The estimate of temporary ADI for man is now set at 0 - 0.005 mg/kg. This is based on the NOAEL of rats of 5 ppm in the diet equivalent to 0.25 mg/kg/day. The estimated fatal oral dose is 0.6 g for a 150 lb. (70 kg) person. The LD50 for humans is unknown.

"Look at the Flowers" is the fourteenth episode of the tenth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead, which aired on AMC on March 29, 2020. The episode was written by Channing Powell and directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer.
After the death of Alpha (Samantha Morton), heroes and villains reckon with the aftermath of the Hilltop fire. Meanwhile, Eugene (Josh McDermitt) takes a group on a journey to meet Stephanie, with the hopes of befriending another civilization.
This episode marks the final appearance of Samantha Morton as Alpha and the first appearance of Paola Lázaro as Juanita "Princess" Sanchez, a character adapted from the comics. The episode received positive reviews from critics.
Plot
In a flashback, Carol gives the imprisoned Negan the offer to bring her Alpha's head in exchange for clearing his name. In the present, Carol places Alpha's disembodied but still moving head atop a pike. Negan then demands Carol to hold up her end of the deal, but Carol criticizes how long it took him to complete his mission and tells him he can wait until she's ready or face the community, whom he fears.
Elsewhere, the survivors of the Hilltop gather to make sure the children are safe. Rosita encourages Eugene to tell the group about his radio contact and planned meeting with Stephanie. While there are concerns about being led into another trap, they agree Eugene should keep the meeting; Eugene, Ezekiel, and Yumiko set off to a downtown area.
Meanwhile, Beta and two Whisperers find Alpha's head. Enraged, Beta forces one of the Whisperers to get bitten by the head after he unwisely identifies Beta as the "new Alpha"; the other Whisperer flees. He then takes the head and travels to his former home in a nearby town. In a fit of rage, he destroys much of his former home.
Beforehand, Negan goes to free Lydia, but is instead greeted by a punch and interrogated by Daryl. The former explains Alpha's fate at his hands, but Daryl doesn't believe him. Meanwhile Carol goes off on her own and starts to have visions of Alpha, taunting Carol and comparing her to herself, with no solace in isolation.
That night, at the pike where Alpha's head is missing, Negan and Daryl find themselves surrounded by three Whisperers, having learned of Alpha's fate and treating Negan as the "new Alpha". Negan, pretending to go along with the Whisperers to get them off guard, uses the opportunity to kill the Whisperers to prove his loyalty to Alexandria, freeing Daryl in the process. Meanwhile at the nearby town, Beta has been listening to his own music, as it is revealed he was a former country music singer named "Half Moon". He then turns on his music loudly as to attract a huge horde of walkers.
The next morning, when Carol gets briefly trapped in the rubble of a collapsing ceiling with a walker approaching, the vision of Alpha suggests to Carol that she "look at the flowers" and accept death, but Carol breaks free in time to put down the walker; the vision of Alpha disperses.
Within the city, after discovering a tableau of walkers arranged in humorous situations, Ezekiel, Eugene, and Rosita encounter a young woman excited to see them. Meanwhile Beta, having achieved catharsis, thanks Alpha, puts the head down, and uses part of her skin to repair his mask. Beta then starts to lead the massive horde toward a new destination.
Production
As of this episode, Danai Gurira is removed from the opening credits. This is the first time in the series since season two that her name does not appear. After her character is killed in "Walk with Us", Samantha Morton returns as Alpha in Carol's (Melissa McBride) hallucinations while the episode also marks the departure of Morton, who first appeared in the season nine mid-season premiere episode "Adaptation".
The episode's title derives from a line Carol speaks to Lizzie (Brighton Sharbino) before Carol is forced to kill her from the season four episode "The Grove". According to showrunner Angela Kang, the idea of the episode came mostly from its writer Channing Powell in how Carol would react once Alpha was dead and her revenge was complete, reflecting on how the character had to do a number of dark actions herself, such as killing Lizzie, in her past.
The episode introduces Juanita "Princess" Sanchez (Paola Lázaro), a character adapted from the comic book series. Whereas in the comics, the group meets her in Pittsburgh rather than Virginia. She is shown to still be a survivor that has been in complete isolation and developed quirky ways to deal with her isolation. Within the comics, Princess' introduction begins the final major arc of the comics: The introduction of The Commonwealth—a group and network of communities that the combined Alexandria Safe-Zone residents eventually join which only creates additional tensions. It was first introduced in "Volume 29", "Issue #173" of Robert Kirkman's original comic book series.
The identity of Beta (Ryan Hurst) as famed country music singer "Half Moon" was a device that was unique to the television series. Within the comics, Beta was a former basketball player, but Hurst did not have that appearance. While the writers considered other sports, Hurst suggested the idea of a country singer like Garth Brooks, who has a one-off alter ego—Chris Gaines. The writers used this idea to consider that the former singer had a darker side that came out in the zombie apocalypse. They planted this idea earlier in the season with a song, titled "The Turtle and the Monkey", that Magna (Nadia Hilker) listens to on a phonograph, which was written by Emily Kinney (who had played Beth Greene in the series) and sung by Hurst in episode five. The second song heard in this episode is titled "I Went to the Well", which was released in its entirety by AMC on April 1, 2020. A record cover of "Half Moon" with Hurst's face had also been shown in the fifth season of Fear the Walking Dead.
Reception
Critical reception
"Look at the Flowers" received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 88% with an average score of 6.80 out of 10, based on 17 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: "'Look at the Flowers' dives back into the conflict between the Hilltop crew and the Whisperers with a richly introspective episode that explores the far-reaching impact of Alpha's demise."
Ron Hogan of Den of Geek praised the character development of Negan, writing: "Negan, despite everything, is still funny. Eugene has never not been funny, particularly when Josh McDermitt starts motoring his mouth around that very thick dialogue provided by Channing Powell's excellent script." Noetta Harjo of Geek Girl Authority praised the episode, writing: "Sooo, Carol wrote a letter to Maggie about Alpha. I'm really hoping Maggie shows up in the next episode. That was interesting to watch Alpha tell Carol her thoughts."
Writing for The A.V. Club, Alex McLevy gave the episode a B- and wrote: "A good portion of it worked at least reasonably well. This is partially thanks to a script that only overcooks half of the dialogue scenes." Writing for TV Fanatic, Paul Dailly praised the episode and wrote: "'Look at the Flowers' was mostly an episode to set up the coming events, and boy, we're in for a wild ride to the finish line." Writing for We Live Entertainment, Aaron Neuwirth praised Jeffrey Dean Morgan's performance and wrote: "Allowing Jeffrey Dean Morgan the chance to play up multiple sides of Negan is effective."
Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 7 out of 10, writing: "Though some of Carol's meandering, and Ezekiel's trek, felt trite, "Look at the Flowers" was still busy enough overall to plant seeds for more interesting things to come... It was a cool-down chapter, but an effective one." Erik Kain of Forbes praised the character development of Beta, writing: "This was mostly a very good episode. Beta is a very scary guy, and the end suggests that the full force of his wrath and vengeance is about to be unleashed on our heroes."
Ratings
"Look at the Flowers" received 3.26 million viewers and was the highest-rated cable program of the night.

The New England Civil War Museum and Research Center was originally started by local Civil War veterans in 1896. It was not until March 1994 that it was formally established as a museum and opened to the public. It is located within the Memorial Building, inside a former Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) Hall in Rockville, Connecticut. Thomas F. Burpee Post #71 of the Grand Army of the Republic held their meetings in the Grand Hall from 1890 until 1929. Alden Skinner Camp #45 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, their direct heir, have held their monthly meetings in the hall since 1890, making it the oldest, continuously used GAR Hall in the entire country.
Holdings and history
Most of the museum's original collection was donated by the Civil War veterans of Burpee Post. The museum's collection today holds several hundred items from the Civil War period. Most notable are the Hirst brothers' collection (14th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry), the Thomas F. Burpee collection (Colonel, 21st Connecticut Volunteer Infantry), Kilbourne Newell collection (14th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry) and the Charles Weston collection (musician, 5th & 7th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry).
The museum also contains the O'Connell-Chapman Library, which has over 1000 volumes of Civil War literature, in addition to original copies of the 128 volumes of The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. This was compiled by the US War Department and originally published from 1880–1901. The Library also owns the original Civil War map books that accompanies the Office Records and several photographs of local Civil War veterans.
The building has the Grand Hall, an outer room, and a kitchen. The museum and library, along with the hall and its rooms, are the property of the Alden Skinner Camp #45 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. Fifteen years ago, the Museum acquired part of its original property from the town of Vernon. Once owned by the GAR, the property was annexed by the town and used as a jail cell.
The Memorial Hall is also used for meetings by the Connecticut Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS).

Great Yarmouth railway station (originally Yarmouth Vauxhall) is one of two eastern termini of the Wherry Lines in the East of England, serving the seaside town of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The other terminus at the eastern end of the lines is , and the western terminus to which all trains run is .
Trains from Great Yarmouth run to Norwich via one of two routes: either via , the more regularly used line, or via . Via Acle, Great Yarmouth is down the line from Norwich, and via Reedham it is .
The station is currently managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all of the trains that call. Off-peak there is one train per hour to Norwich, with the service increasing in frequency during peak times.
History
Yarmouth Vauxhall
The Bill for the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway (Y&NR) received Royal Assent on 18 June 1842. Work started on the line in April 1843 and the line and its stations were opened on 1 May 1844. Great Yarmouth station was originally named Yarmouth Vauxhall. The Y&NR line to Norwich through Reedham was the first railway in the county to open.
On 30 June 1845 a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway with the Norwich & Brandon Railway came into effect and Yarmouth Vauxhall station became a Norfolk Railway asset.
The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) and its rival the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) were both sizing up the NR to acquire and expand their railway empire. The ECR trumped the EUR by taking over the NR, including Yarmouth-Vauxhall Station on 8 May 1848.
By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway, which wished to amalgamate formally but could not obtain government agreement for this until an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed by the amalgamation. Actually, Yarmouth-Vauxhall became a GER station on 1 July 1862 when the GER took over the ECR and the EUR before the Bill received the Royal Assent.[4]
Two decades into GER ownership the latter decided to build a shorter route between Yarmouth Vauxhall to Norwich Thorpe. Work started in the early-1880s. The GER started the new line about 1 mile west of Yarmouth Vauxhall and the junction was named Breydon. The 1st part of the new line opened on 1 March 1883 as far as the 1st station west of Yarmouth Vauxhall called .
The system settled down for the next 4 decades, apart from the disruption of First World War. The difficult economic circumstances that existed after World War 1 led the Government to pass the Railways Act 1921 which led to the creation of the Big Four. The GER amalgamated with several other companies to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Yarmouth Vauxhall became a LNER station on 1 January 1923.
In May 1943, the station was badly damaged during an air raid, resulting in the upper floor of the passenger station needing to be demolished. Train services, however, operated throughout this period. The remains of the original station building were removed, and the station rebuilt, in 1960.
On nationalisation in 1948 the station and its services became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways. The station name was simplified to Yarmouth by BR at some point between 1953 and 1962.
Before rail closures of the 1950s and the later Beeching Axe the station was the largest of three major railway stations in the town. The three stations had been linked together since 1882 by the Yarmouth Union Railway.
Yarmouth Vauxhall, named Great Yarmouth since 16 May 1989, is the only station to remain open. There used to be large sidings and an engine shed before they were demolished to make way for the new Asda superstore and bypass.
On privatisation the station and its services were transferred to Anglia Railways, which operated it until April 2004 when National Express East Anglia won the replacement franchise, operating under the brand name 'one' until February 2008. From February 2012 Abellio Greater Anglia took over operating the franchise.
The town was also formerly served by the following stations:
Yarmouth Beach
was located on Nelson Road and was owned by M&GN who ran services up the Norfolk coast to and . It was closed in 1959 and is now a coach station although plans exist to turn the area into offices.
Yarmouth South Town
was owned by the Great Eastern Railway but also served as the terminus for the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway which ran services through and to join with the current East Suffolk Line for a mainline service to London. It was closed in 1970.
Newtown Halt
was located on Salisbury Road and was owned by the M&GN. It opened in 1933 and closed in 1959.
Services
Summer 1959
With the closure of Yarmouth Beach station in early 1959, Vauxhall became the focus of the summer Saturday traffic for Great Yarmouth. The station had always had a number of summer Saturday trains up to this point but this hike in numbers had led to some re-modelling of the station layout - platform lengthening and changes to carriage stabling - in order to cope with the additional traffic.
A typical summer Saturday saw an additional 24 timetabled passenger trains from locations including York, Derby, Sheffield, Manchester, Leicester, and Sunderland. In addition, on 25 July 1959 there were an extra eight holiday relief workings that ran. Some local workings were cancelled to cope with this influx of trains, but it indicates the significant numbers of UK holidaymakers still travelling by train and still holidaying in Great Yarmouth at this time.
Today
There is one train each hour between Great Yarmouth and Norwich, with additional services during the morning and evening peaks. Most trains run via Acle, although there are still a number that run via Reedham. Sunday services tend to be hourly and, up to 1600, every other service runs via Reedham.
All services are operated by Greater Anglia.
There are proposals to run a wider variety of direct services from Yarmouth to London Liverpool Street, Stansted Airport, and Peterborough from 2025.
Carriage sidings
New sidings were provided at the western end of the station to cope with the additional services operating into the station following the closure of the M&GN system. It is a crescent-shaped site between the A47 road and Wherryman's Way at the northernmost point of the River Yare about northwest of station. It had fallen out of use in the 1980s when the Norwich Crown Point depot was built.
In 2010 the out-of-use sidings were purchased by Gt Yarmouth Borough Council, intended for use as a freight terminal despite the lack of rail connection to the town's port. It was hoped that 10,000 tonnes of sugar cane per week would be carried from Yarmouth to Cantley. The need to use a lorry shuttle between the docks and the rail yard, coupled to a £3.2 million quote for replacing the sidings at Cantley saw the plan dropped.
In May 2020, Eastern Rail Services commenced a lease with Norfolk County Council and Network Rail for Yarmouth Vauxhall sidings. Managing director James Steward said the siding matched ERS' requirement for an East Anglian site to base its rolling stock. Following extensive de-vegetation works, Direct Rail Services 37402 became the first locomotive in 19 years to run into the sidings on 26 May 2020, followed the next day by it delivering five former Abellio Greater Anglia Mark 3 coaches for storage. On 6 July 2020 ERS was authorised a license exemption permitting them to operate trains within the site.
Class 08 08762, owned by Eastern Rail Services' sister company RMS Locotec, was delivered by road from Heaton TMD on 16 June 2020 to take up shunting duties on site.
Recent developments
A campaign was launched in 2010 to bring Great Yarmouth Station up-to-date, called the "Fix Great Yarmouth Station" campaign. The project attracted more than 3,000 pledges of support.
During 2012 Great Yarmouth Community Trust, in partnership with Greater Anglia, provided a welcoming and information service at the station for incoming holidaymakers and tourists. This service was operated as 'Welcome Host' and continued in 2013. The service was run on a voluntary basis.
In 2017, signalling and track changes saw Platform 1 closed and lifted, reducing the number of operational platforms at the station to three.
In 2018 it was announced that the station would benefit from £710,000 of investment, redeveloping the entrance and surrounding areas, with the work being funded by the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership's Growth Deal. The project completed in November 2018.

In medical and surgical therapy, revascularization is the restoration of perfusion to a body part or organ that has had ischemia. It is typically accomplished by surgical means. Vascular bypass and angioplasty are the two primary means of revascularization.
The term derives from the prefix re-, in this case meaning "restoration" and vasculature, which refers to the circulatory structures of an organ.
It is often combined with "urgent" to form urgent vascularization.
Revascularization involves a thorough analysis and diagnosis and treatment of the existing diseased vasculature of the affected organ, and can be aided by the use of different imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, PET scan, CT scan, and X-ray fluoroscopy.
Applications
For coronary artery disease (ischemic heart disease), coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention (coronary balloon angioplasty) are the two primary means of revascularization. When those cannot be done, transmyocardial revascularization or percutaneous myocardial revascularization, done with a laser, may be an option.
Treatment for gangrene often requires revascularization, if possible. The surgery is also indicated to treat ischemic wounds (inadequate tissue perfusion) in some forms of chronic wounds, such as diabetic ulcers.

Youth and education
Born in London, England in 1976 to Temne parents from Sierra Leone, Sesay returned with them at the age of seven to their homeland. Raised in their Muslim faith, she lived in Sierra Leone for most of her childhood. She is one of three children, with an older sister and a younger brother. Isha's mother is Dr. Kadi Sesay, a former lecturer at Fourah Bay College. Dr. Sesay, in 1992, was appointed as an advisor to the government of Valentine Strasser. Isha's father worked as a legal advisor to the SLPMB (Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board); he died in 1988.
Sesay studied at the private Fourah Bay College School in Freetown. She also attended St. Joseph's Secondary School in Freetown. At the age of 16, in 1992 she moved to the UK for further study and college. After completing her A-levels, she was accepted into Trinity College, Cambridge, where she read English. She worked as a waitress in a bar while studying. She decided to become a television journalist, having previously aspired to become an actress. During her final year, she began writing to media groups seeking work.
Career
Post college
After graduating, Sesay began her television career as a researcher for the BBC talk show Kilroy, initially as an unpaid intern. She later was hired as a full-time paid employee. In 1998, she moved to Glasgow to work for BBC Scotland, and, after a period behind the camera, got her first job as a TV announcer on BBC Choice.

The following year, she also took up the role of presenter on Evening Express on HLN. She is currently based in Los Angeles, United States.
Leaving CNN
On 2 August 2018, Sesay announced that she was leaving CNN after 13 years. She cited the media's focus on United States President Donald Trump as a reason for her decision. Sesay announced that she will be writing a book about the abduction of Chibok girls, and that she plans to continue her engagement with African issues.
W.E. Can Lead
In 2014, Sesay launched W.E. Can Lead (Women Everywhere Can Lead), an educational, humanitarian 501(c)3, non-profit organization. It was created to support African girls in receiving educational support to become future leaders. In August 2018, the program was mostly working with Nigerian girls, but it is open for girls from everywhere in Africa.
It is a two-tiered program comprising a base and a specialization phase. After one year in which the girls learn basic skills like financial literacy, critical thinking and good health practices as well how to build self-esteem and self-awareness, they can apply to take part in the Young Leader development program. Those who do not gain a place may attend annual empowerment camps and an inspirational speaker series. The attendees receive financial support to cover tuition, uniforms and other supplies. In August 2018 there were more than 600 girls from ages 12 to 18 participating in the program.
In January 2017, actor Idris Elba auctioned a date with him to raise money for W.E. Can Lead. They cooperated again in 2019, when they started a tombola in which donors could win a McLaren 720S Coupe.

Hans Kronberger (May 9, 1951 – July 14, 2018) was an Austrian politician who was Member of the European Parliament. He was a parliamentary member of the Freedom Party of Austria, although was officially considered non-attached. After his unsuccessful candidacy in the 2004 European Parliament election, Kronberger contested his fellow Freedom Party of Austria member, Andreas Mölzer's election in the Constitutional Court of Austria.
Hans Kronberger was born on May 9, 1951 at Hall bei Admont, Austria. Kronberger was first elected to the European Parliament on 11 November 1996. Prior to his election to the European Parliament, Kronberger had worked as a television journalist, and had become well known as an expert in environmental policy. During his time as a Member of the European Parliament, Kronberger sat on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, the Delegation to the EU-Poland Joint Parliamentary Committee, the Delegation to the EU-Slovak Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee and the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. He also served as a substitute on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Although Kronberger was re-elected on July 20, 1999, he was not re-elected during the 2004 election due to the flow of preference votes being directed towards the other Freedom Party of Austria candidate, Andreas Mölzer. Kronberger challenged the result in the Constitutional Court of Austria, but his claim was rejected as he did not file his dispute within the time limit for the contesting of election results.

Mariss Ivars Georgs Jansons (14 January 1943 – 1 December 2019) was a Latvian conductor best known for his interpretations of Mahler, Strauss and Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and Shostakovich. During his lifetime he was often cited as among the world's leading conductors; in a 2015 Bachtrack poll, he was ranked by music critics as the world's third best living conductor. Jansons was long associated with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (BRSO; 2003–2019) and Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (ROC; 2004–2015) as music director.
Born in Riga, Latvia, Jansons moved to Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1956, where he studied conducting, and he received further training in Austria. He first achieved prominence with the Oslo Philharmonic, where he served as music director from 1979 to 2000. Besides the BRSO and ROC, he also directed the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1997 to 2004; he was a frequent guest conductor with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and London Symphony Orchestra. Jansons recorded prolifically, and was the recipient of numerous awards.
Early life
Jansons was born in Riga, Latvia—then under German occupation during the Second World War—to Iraida Jansons, the diva of the Riga Opera, and Arvīds Jansons, conductor of the opera orchestra. Iraida, who was Jewish, gave birth to her son in hiding after being smuggled out of the Riga Ghetto, where her father and brother were murdered by the Nazis. As a child, Jansons first studied violin with his father.
In 1956, Arvīds was appointed assistant conductor to Yevgeny Mravinsky at the Leningrad Philharmonic. Jansons joined his father in Leningrad, where he began to study conducting, and soon entered the Leningrad Conservatory. In 1968, Herbert von Karajan visited the Soviet Union, and he singled out Jansons and Dmitri Kitayenko from a group of young conductors. Karajan offered Jansons the opportunity to study with him in Berlin, but the Soviet authorities blocked the offer. In 1969, Jansons continued his training with Hans Swarowsky in Vienna, and then in Salzburg with Karajan. In 1971, Jansons won the second prize at the "Herbert von Karajan" International Conducting Competition. Karajan invited Jansons to be his assistant with the Berlin Philharmonic, but the Soviet authorities blocked Jansons from ever hearing about the offer.
Career
In 1973, Jansons was appointed Associate Conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1979, he was appointed Music Director of the Oslo Philharmonic, with which he performed, recorded and toured extensively. Jansons resigned his Oslo position in 2000 after disputes with the city over the acoustics of the Oslo Concert Hall.
In 1992, Jansons was named Principal Guest Conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. He worked as a guest conductor with the London Symphony Orchestra and recorded Mahler's Symphony No. 6 with them for the LSO Live label.
In 1997, Jansons became the Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. His initial contract was for three years, but his subsequent contract renewals were evergreen contracts that required yearly renewal. In June 2002, he announced his resignation, which would become effective in 2004.
In April 1996, Jansons nearly died from a severe heart attack while conducting the final pages of La bohème in Oslo. He recuperated in Switzerland. Later, surgeons in Pittsburgh fitted an implanted defibrillator in his chest to give his heart an electric jolt if it failed. (Jansons's father had died at a 1984 concert, conducting the Hallé Orchestra.) Jansons stated that he suffered from jet lag, and this was one reason that he left his American position.
At the start of the 2003-2004 season, Jansons began his tenure as Chief Conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (BRSO), for an initial contract of three years. His commitment with the BRSO was for ten weeks per season. In September 2006, Jansons extended his initial BRSO contract to August 2009. In July 2007, he further extended his contract with the BRSO to August 2012. In April 2011, he extended his BRSO contract to August 2015 in Munich. In June 2013, the BRSO further extended Jansons's contract through August 2018. In May 2015, the BRSO announced another extension of Jansons's contract through 2021. In July 2018, the orchestra announced a further extension of his contract through 2024. He regularly campaigned for the construction of a new concert hall for the orchestra. On 8 November 2019, he conducted his final orchestral concert, at Carnegie Hall with the BRSO and Diana Damrau.
In October 2002, Jansons was named the sixth Chief Conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (RCO) of Amsterdam, effective 1 September 2004, succeeding Riccardo Chailly. His initial Amsterdam contract was for three years, and his commitment in Amsterdam was for twelve weeks per season. In April 2014, the orchestra announced that Jansons was to stand down as chief conductor after the 2014–2015 season. He conducted his final concert as chief conductor of the RCO on 20 March 2015, in the presence of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima. He subsequently held the title of conductor emeritus of the KCO until his death.
In 2006, Jansons conducted the Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Concert for the first time. Also in January 2006, he was awarded MIDEM's Artist of the Year Award in Cannes. In October 2007, Jansons (who was Lutheran) conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra for Pope Benedict XVI and 7,000 other listeners in the papal audience hall (Auditorio Paul VI). Jansons conducted the Vienna New Year's Concert for the second time in 2012, and for the third and final time in 2016.
Personal life
Jansons was married twice. He and his first wife, Ira, had a daughter, Ilona, who became a pianist at the Mariinsky Theatre. The marriage ended during his tenure in Oslo. Jansons and his second wife Irina (née Outchitel), a former speech therapist, had a home in Saint Petersburg, where Jansons kept his collection of scores. He held both Latvian and Russian citizenship.
Jansons died during the night of 30 November 2019 / 1 December 2019 at his home in the Tolstoy House, Saint Petersburg, as a result of a longstanding heart condition, aged 76.
Awards and recognition
Jansons was awarded various international honours for his achievements, including Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit from King Harald of Norway and memberships in the Royal Academy of Music in London and the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Society of Music Friends) in Vienna. He was awarded the St. Hallvard Medal in 1986. In May 2006, he was awarded the Order of the Three Stars (2nd class or Grand Commander), Latvia's highest state honour. He was awarded the Bavarian Order of Merit in 2007 and in 2010, the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art. In 2008, Jansons received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art.
Jansons' recording of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13 with Sergey Aleksashkin (bass) and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus won the Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance at the 2006 Grammy Awards.
In January 2006 he was awarded a Midem, a Cannes Classical Award as Artist of the Year. In 2007 he was honoured by the German Phono Academy with the Echo Klassik as Conductor of the Year. In 2011, he was awarded the same title by the German journal Opernwelt.
Jansons won the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 2013. On 31 March 2013 Jansons was awarded a medal of honour "For the Merits before St. Petersburg". On 4 October 2013, Jansons received the Grand Merit Cross with Star of the Federal Republic of Germany.
On 1 November 2013, Jansons was awarded Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion and received it from Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science Jet Bussemaker.
In November 2017, the Royal Philharmonic Society awarded Jansons the RPS Gold Medal, with Mitsuko Uchida presenting the medal to Jansons during a concert with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks) on 24 November 2017 at the Barbican Hall. Jansons was the 104th recipient of the RPS Gold Medal.
In 2018, Jansons was awarded Honorary Membership of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and in June 2018 of the Vienna Philharmonic.

The 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships was held in Christchurch, New Zealand from January 21 to 30, 2011. Athletes with a disability competed, and the Championships was a qualifying event for the London 2012 Paralympic Games.
Over 1000 athletes competed, including Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner, who competed in class T44 at the 100m, 4 × 100 m relay, 200m, and 400m events.
A warm-up meet, with free entry for the audience, was held on Friday January 14.
Estimates placed the total visitor spend in the city at around $12 million.
Venue
The championship was staged in the 20,000-seat Queen Elizabeth II Park stadium that was built in 1973 for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games. Three weeks after the championship closed, the venue was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and has since been demolished.
Coverage
At least 120 journalists from 13 countries reported on the Championships. The countries included Brazil, Egypt, Finland, Switzerland, Algeria, Australia, Colombia and the United Kingdom.
The internet-TV channel ParalympicSport.TV, owned by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), in conjunction with Sky Television and Kordia, broadcast daily live coverage of the Championships. ParalympicSport.TV also added clips to their YouTube channel.
Events
Opening ceremony
The opening ceremony was held at Cathedral Square on Friday January 21 as a free event. Over 1000 athletes paraded through the streets of Christchurch. At Cathedral Square, the athletes were greeted by a Pōwhiri, a Māori welcoming ceremony. The New Zealand flag was raised and the national anthem performed. The Championships were Officially opened by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Rt Hon. John Key.
Classification
F = field athletes
T = track athletes
P = pentathlon
11–13 – visually impaired, 11 and 12 compete with a sighted guide
20 – intellectual disability
31–38 – cerebral palsy
41–46 – amputation, les autre
51–58 – wheelchair athletes
Where there are more than one classification in one event, (for example discus throw F54/55/56), a percentage system is used to determine who's the winner.
Schedule
The 1st and 2nd placed athletes in any individual medal event on the London 2012 Paralympic Games Programme, qualify the NPC for one (1) qualification slot (per placing) for the London 2012 Paralympic Games.
Medalists
The sighted guides who run together with athletes with a visual impairment at the Championship, did not receive a medal. This will change for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. For the first time, also guides at a major international athletics event will receive medals. In Paralympic winter sports, such as alpine skiing, biathlon and cross-country skiing the guides receive medals, for example at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. In Paralympic tandem cycling events, the pilots receive medals, for example at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.

is a song recorded by Japanese singer-songwriter Miliyah Kato for her debut album Rose. It was released as the album's third single on March 24, 2005. "Dear Lonely Girl" is considered an answer song to ECD's "ECD no Lonely Girl", from which it samples its structure. Both songs sample the melody of Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing" and the hook of idol singer Yuri Satō's "Lonely Girl" (1983), which became the chorus of Kato's song.
The hook of Kato's "Dear Lonely Girl" involves her shouting out various feminine given names. These names are lifted from both Kato's real life, including the names of members of her entourage, and from fiction, namely character names from the premier cell phone novel series Deep Love.
Kato's song "Lipstick" (2015) was written from the perspective of the same protagonist, but ten years later. In 2017, Kato released the song "Shinyaku Dear Lonely Girl" featuring ECD, in which she samples "Dear Lonely Girl".

Christine Darden (born September 10, 1942, as Christine Mann) is an American mathematician, data analyst, and aeronautical engineer who devoted much of her 40-year career in aerodynamics at NASA to researching supersonic flight and sonic booms. She had an M.S. in mathematics and had been teaching at Virginia State University before starting to work at the Langley Research Center in 1967. She earned a PhD in engineering at George Washington University in 1983 and has published numerous articles in her field. She was the first African-American woman at NASA's Langley Research Center to be promoted into the Senior Executive Service, the top rank in the federal civil service.
Darden is one of the researchers featured in the book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016), a history of some of the influential African-American women mathematicians and engineers at NASA in the mid-20th century, by Margot Lee Shetterly.
In 2019, Darden was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.
Early life and career
Christine Mann was born September 10, 1942 to schoolteacher Desma l. Cheney and insurance agent Noah Horace Mann Sr. in Monroe, North Carolina. Both parents encouraged her to pursue a quality education. Starting from age three, Darden was brought by her mother to her own classroom where she taught, and at age four, Darden was enrolled in kindergarten. During elementary school, Darden took a great interest in breaking apart and reconstructing mechanical objects like her bicycle. Darden finished her last two years of primary school at Allen High School, a boarding school in Asheville, North Carolina.
She graduated as the class valedictorian in 1958, subsequently receiving a scholarship to attend Hampton University, a historically black college then known as Hampton Institute. During her studies at Hampton, she participated in some of the early protests of the Civil Rights Movement. She participated in several student sit-ins alongside her other Black peers. Mann graduated from Hampton with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1962. She also earned a teaching certification, and taught high school mathematics for a brief time.
In 1963, Mann married Walter L. Darden Jr., a middle-school science teacher. In 1965 she became a research assistant at Virginia State College, studying aerosol physics. At Virginia State, Darden earned an M.S. in 1967 and taught mathematics there.
That same year she was hired by NASA as a data analyst at Langley Research Center. Darden started in the "computer pool", performing calculations as a computer for engineers. She began automating the process by writing computer programs.
After moving into more aeronautical research, in 1973 Darden was promoted to a position as aerospace engineer by her superior John V. Becker. She had nearly been fired earlier. Her early findings in the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a revolution of aerodynamics design to produce low-boom sonic effects. In 1983 Darden earned a Ph.D in engineering from George Washington University.
In 1989, Darden was appointed as leader of the Sonic Boom Team, a subsidiary of the High Speed Research (HSR) Program. On the Sonic Boom Team she worked on designs to decrease the negative effects of sonic booms, such as noise pollution and the depletion of the ozone layer. Her team tested new wing and nose designs for supersonic aircraft. She also designed a computer program to simulate sonic booms.
The program was cancelled by the government in February 1998, "without fan fare or press announcement." A 1998 abstract published by Darden describes the program as focused on "technologies needed for the development of an environmentally friendly, economically viable High-Speed Civil Transport [HSCT]." Darden wrote more than 50 articles in the general field of aeronautical design, specializing in supersonic flow and flap design, as well as the prediction and minimization of sonic booms.
NASA's "human computers"
In 1935, the first African-American women mathematicians were hired as human computers at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), then known as NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics). Since many men were overseas fighting in World War II, more job opportunities were given to both white and African-American women. The latter computer pool became known as the "West Area Computers", in reference to their segregated office. The human computers performed calculations to support research into plane flight and, later, rockets. Because the state of Virginia, where the Langley Research Center was located, had racial segregation, Jim Crow laws were followed at the facility, which is located near Hampton. This changed after the 1964 Civil Rights Act which banned segregation.
The collective, once tasked with processing scores of collected flight test data, by the 1940s had garnered a reputation as "human computers" who were essential to NASA's operation. During the 1950s and 1960s, more of these women gained opportunities to advance as technicians and engineers.
Darden started working in the computer pool in 1967 at NASA, after she had completed an M.S. in mathematics at Virginia State University and taught there. By that time, computers were increasingly used for the complex calculations to support engineering and design. Darden left the computer pool in 1989 for a position as engineer, working on decreasing sonic boom in supersonic flight. She earned her PhD in 1983 (with the support of NASA), and became known for her research as "one of NASA's preeminent experts on supersonic flight and sonic booms." Darden was promoted as a manager, and she advanced to become the first African-American woman at Langley to be promoted into the Senior Executive Service, the top rank in the federal civil service.
In March 2007, Darden retired from NASA as director of the Office of Strategic Communication and Education.
Awards
In 1985, Darden received the Dr. A. T. Weathers Technical Achievement Award from the National Technical Association. She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1987. She received three Certificates of Outstanding Performance from Langley Research Center: in 1989, 1991, and 1992.
On January 28, 2018, Darden received the Presidential Citizenship Award at Hampton University in recognition for her contribution and service".
Darden received an honorary degree from North Carolina State University on December 19, 2018.
Darden also received an honorary degree from the George Washington University on May 19, 2019.
In 2019, Darden was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.
She delivered the Christine Darden Lecture at MathFest 2021.

Let's Elope (20 November 1987 – 11 September 2016) was a Champion Thoroughbred racehorse in Australia.
Background
Bred by Highview Stud in Hamilton, New Zealand, Let's Elope was a giant chestnut mare who in 1991 became the first mare in more than 50 years to complete Australia's famed Caulfield Cup - Melbourne Cup double (the "Cups double"). The last mare to complete the double had been Rivette in 1939.
By the Blushing Groom stallion Nassipour, out of Sharon Jane, she was a NZ$16,000 purchase at the 1989 New Zealand Magic Millions sale. Originally trained by Dave O'Sullivan for the Fleiter family, she was un-raced as a two-year-old but won her first start as a three-year-old in 1990. Despite showing above-average ability, her record in New Zealand was underwhelming, and, on the advice of her trainer, the owners accepted a NZ$150,000 offers for her. Her new owners, Dennis Marks and Kevin White, transferred her to the Australian stables of the "Cups King", Bart Cummings.
Racing career
Let's Elope was close-up in her first two starts for Cummings, and, while down the track in the wet at Caulfield, was a different horse on top of the ground. In a superb season, Let's Elope began a seven-race winning streak in the Turnbull Stakes, on the first weekend of October, took the Mackinnon Stakes and both the Cups, and returned in the new year for the Orr Stakes, the St George Stakes, and the Australian Cup, in course record time, on Labour Day in March. A fetlock injury then cut short her season, but Let's Elope had the 1992 Horse of the Year Award in her keeping.
She returned at five, and, while thwarted by wet tracks for much of the spring, won a match race with Better Loosen Up at Caulfield and was narrowly defeated by Super Impose in a classic Cox Plate (after the race, she was relegated from second to fifth for cutting off the unlucky Better Loosen Up). Ten days later, Let's Elope was one of three scratchings from the Melbourne Cup. After a bleeding attack in the Japan Cup, Let's Elope continued her career in the United States.
Conditioned in the U.S. by U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Ron McAnally, Let's Elope won a minor race on debut, and was first past the post in the Grade I Beverly D. Stakes in front of Flawlessly before being relegated to third - under American rules, she was relegated for simply causing interference, not because the third horse would have beaten her home. The recurrence of a bleeding attack and a fractured cannon bone forced her retirement at the close of 1993.
At stud, Let's Elope had visited some of the world's greatest stallions, including Storm Cat, and, while considered slightly disappointing, has produced the stakeswinner Ustinov (by Seeking The Gold), who was placed in a number of Group One races and Outback Joe (by Elvstroem) winner of the 2014 Adelaide Cup.
Death
Let's Elope died in her sleep on 12 September 2016 at Lauriston Park, Euroa, Victoria, Australia.

The pale-headed jacamar (Brachygalba goeringi) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae. It is found in Colombia and Venezuela.
Taxonomy and systematics
The pale-headed jacamar is monotypic. It and the dusky-backed (B. salmoni), brown (B. lugubris), and white-throated jacamars (B. albogularis) form a superspecies.
Description
The pale-headed jacamar is long and weighs . The male's crown, nape, and shoulders are ashy brown. The rest of the upper parts are dark brown glossed with greenish; they look blue-black when worn. It has a pale supercilium and a buffy-white throat. It has a chestnut band on the upper belly and dark brown flanks; the rest of the underparts are white. The female is almost identical. The juvenile has a gray crown and nape, and the upper parts are brighter and the green gloss stronger.
Distribution and habitat
The pale-headed jacamar is found from Arauca and Casanare Departments in Colombia north through northwestern Venezuela at least to Lara. It primarily inhabits the edges of gallery and secondary forest in llanos grasslands. In elevation it ranges as high as but is usually found much lower.
Behavior
Feeding
The pale-headed jacamar's diet is insects, mostly Lepidoptera and Odonata. It often perches on emergent branches in pairs or small family groups and sallies from there to catch its flying prey.
Breeding
The pale-headed jacamar nests in burrows in earth banks. Nesting has been noted in Venezuela during April and May.
Vocalization
The pale-headed jacamar's song is a series of high "weet" notes that increase in speed and pitch and ends with a trill .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the pale-headed jacamar as being of The Least Concern. It is "[c]ommon throughout its range..." and "[n]o specific threats [are] documented so far, despite overall habitat loss in certain areas as a result of deforestation.

Friedrich Wilhelm Sander (25 August 1885 in Glatz (Kłodzko) – 15 September 1938) was a German pyrotechnics and rocket technology engineer as well as manufacturer remembered for his contributions to rocket-powered flight as key protagonist of the Opel-RAK program.
Sander was the son of a professional soldier. He went to school in Uslar on the southwestern edge of the Solling and then learned to be a mechanical engineer. At the Technikum Strelitz in Altstrelitz in Mecklenburg he became an engineer around 1908/09. In 1909 Sander moved to Bremerhaven. Here he worked in various areas. In 1920 he took over the company of master gunsmith H. G. Cordes in Bremerhaven, who had existed from 1853 and was known as the inventor of the whaling cannfo. Sander soon expanded the factory's products to include signal rockets.
From 1925, the Sander's linen rocket pistols designed by him for the rescue of shipwrecked people belonged to the equipment of the rescue stations and boats of the German Society for the Rescue of Shipwrecked People and many similar organizations around the world. In 1925, Sander bought the Schultz ship telegraph factory in Bremerhaven, which gave him a larger, two-story factory building at Fährstrasse No. 26 as a prerequisite for accepting development contracts offered by the Navy.
In 1928, he was approached by Max Valier, on behalf of Fritz von Opel to provide rockets to propel cars and aircraft as a means of popularizing the use of rockets for propulsion and for promoting the Opel company. Their joint projects within Opel-RAK, the world's first large-scale rocket program, involved the creation of the world's first rocket car, the Opel RAK.1 and the first rocket glider, the Ente, and the world's first purpose-built rocket plane Opel RAK.1.
He was married to Cäcilie Sander and had three boys: Hans HW (1918-1998), Bruno (1918-1983) and Herbert (1920-?).
Opel RAK rocket program
Fritz von Opel and Sander were instrumental in popularizing rockets as means of propulsion for vehicles. In the 1920s, they initiated together with Max Valier, co-founder of the "Verein für Raumschiffahrt", the world's first rocket program, Opel-RAK, leading to speed records for automobiles, rail vehicles and the first public manned rocket-powered flight in September of 1929. Months earlier in 1928, one of his rocket-powered prototypes, the Opel RAK2, reached piloted by von Opel himself at the AVUS speedway in Berlin a record speed of 238 km/h, watched by 3000 spectators and world media, among them Fritz Lang, director of Metropolis and Woman in the Moon, world boxing champion Max Schmeling and many more sports and show business celebrities. A world record for rail vehicles was reached with RAK3 and a top speed of 256 km/h. After these successes, von Opel piloted the world's first public rocket-powered flight using Opel RAK.1, a rocket plane designed by Julius Hatry.
Timeline
On 15 March 1928, Opel tested his first rocket-powered car, the Opel RAK.1, and achieved a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph) in it, proving the feasibility of the concept of rocket propulsion. Less than two months later, he reached a speed of 230 km/h (143 mph) in the RAK.2, driven by 24 solid-fuel rockets.
Later that same year, he purchased a sailplane named the "Lippisch Ente" (Ente'' is "duck" in German) from Alexander Lippisch and attached rocket motors to it, creating the world's first rocket plane on 11 June. The aircraft exploded on its second test flight, before Opel had had a chance to pilot it himself, so he commissioned a new aircraft, also called the RAK.1, from Julius Hatry, and flew it at Frankfurt-am-Main on 30 September 1929. In the meantime, another mishap had claimed the RAK.3, a rocket-powered railway car powered by 30 solid-fuel rockets which had reached a speed of 254 km/h (157 mph).
Also in 1928, Opel built and test ran a rocket-powered motorcycle called the Monster.
Liquid-fuel rocket development, test launches and a planned flight across the English channel
According to Frank H. Winter, curator at National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, the Opel group was also working on liquid-fuel rockets (SPACEFLIGHT, Vol. 21,2, Feb. 1979): In a cabled exclusive to The New York Times on 30 September 1929, von Opel is quoted as saying: "Sander and I now want to transfer the liquid rocket from the laboratory to practical use. With the liquid rocket I hope to be the first man to thus fly across the English Channel. I will not rest until I have accomplished that." At a speech on the donation of a RAK 2 replica to the Deutsches Museum, von Opel mentioned also Opel engineer Josef Schaberger as a key collaborator. "He belonged," von Opel said, "with the same enthusiasm as Sander to our small secret group, one of the tasks of which was to hide all the preparations from my father, because his paternal apprehensions led him to believe that I was cut out for something better than being a rocket researchist. Schaberger supervised all the details involved in construction and assembly (of rocket cars), and every time I sat behind the wheel with a few hundred pounds of explosives in my rear, and made the first contact, I did so with a feeling of total security [...] As early as 1928, Mr. Schaberger and I developed a liquid rocket, which was definitely the first permanently operating rocket in which the explosive was injected into the combustion chamber and simultaneously cooled using pumps. [...] We used benzol as the fuel," von Opel continued, "and nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer. This rocket was installed in a Mueller-Griessheim aircraft and developed a thrust of 70 kg (154 lb.)." By May 1929, the engine produced a thrust of 200 kg (440 lb.) "for longer than fifteen minutes and in July 1929, the Opel RAK collaborators were able to attain powered phases of more than thirty minutes for thrusts of 300 kg (660-lb.) at Opel's works in Rüsselsheim," according to Max Valier's account.
Max Valier also reports the launch of two experimental liquid-fuel rockets by Sander on 10 and 12 April 1929. In his book “Raketenfahrt” he describes the size of the rockets as of 21 cm in diameter and with a length of 74 cm, weighing 7 kg empty and 16 kg with fuel. The maximum thrust was 45 to 50 kp, with a total burning time of 132 seconds. These properties indicate a gas pressure pumping. The first missile rose so quickly that Sander lost sight of it. Two days later, a second unit was ready to go, Sander tied a 4,000-meter-long rope to the rocket. After 2000 m of rope had been unwound, the line broke and this rocket also disappeared in the area, probably near the Opel proving ground and racetrack in Rüsselsheim, the "Rennbahn". The main purpose of these tests was to develop the propulsion system for the aircraft for crossing the English channel. Therefore, the flights of these two (compared to the airplane) small rockets were not published. The combustion tests with the aircraft rocket engine proceeded very successful. Unfortunately the plane was destroyed during nightly transport on a truck on the Opel factory grounds, as the senior boss Wilhelm von Opel felt disturbed by the engine noise and wanted to stop this new “dangerous madness” of his son.
Imprisonment in Third Reich period
From 1930, Sander (with other pyrotechnics factories) began secretly manufacturing rockets for military purposes, at the direction of Walter Dornberger. Without warning, Sander was arrested by the Gestapo on 31 January 1935. His company was subordinated to a trustee of the military, so it was expropriated and all documents were confiscated. After three months in custody, Sander was released, only to be arrested again in November 1935. After a year in custody, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison and a fine for treason. Sander had also sold his missiles to Italy and England. Since these were older versions of his powder rockets, he did not consider this to be forbidden. Sander speculated that the Army Weapons Office ("Heereswaffenamt") wanted to develop and manufacture the missile weapons itself. His company was run as Donar GmbH für Apparatebau without him. He died in 1938.

Helichrysum thianschanicum is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is commonly known as silver spike or icicle plant. It is part of a large genus of over 500 species.
Description
Helichrysum hianschanicum is a small perennial shrub that grows tall and wide. It resembles a lavender plant with basal branching and erect stems and is covered with long linear leaves that are covered with white pubescence. Yellow clusters of flowers are produced at the ends of stems during the summer. Up to 30 yellow, florets are in each cluster. In its native habitat, H. thianschanicum develops a finger-sized rhizome.
Taxonomy
Helichrysum thianschanicum was first described in 1880 by Eduard August von Regel. The specific epithet refers to the Tian Shan mountain range of Central Asia.
Distribution
Helichrysum thianschanicum grows on gravelly slopes and sand dunes in its native range of western China (Xinjiang) and adjacent Kazakhstan.
Uses
Cultivars
Helichrysum thianschanicum 'Icicles' is a cultivar commonly grown in the United States for its foliage. During the summer, yellow flowers are produced at the ends of the stems and are composed of up to 30 florets. They are not spectacular but do accent the gray-white foliage. H. thianschanicum is a perennial that originates from a mountain range with hot dry summers and cold dry winters and is difficult to grow in wetter climates. 'Icicles' is usually grown as an annual plant in gardens. It seems resistant to most insect problems.

Granite-steppe lands of Buh is a regional landscape park in the north-west of Mykolaiv Oblast in Ukraine.
The park includes the river valley of Southern Buh and the ravine-like vallies of its tributaries: Velyka Korabelna, Bashkala, and Mertvovod. The park stretches on from the southern part of Pervomaisk to the town of Oleksandrivka in Voznesensk Raion. It was established in 1994 by the decision of the Mykolaiv Oblast council and is located on the territory of Pervomaisk, Arbuzynka, Domanivka, and Voznesensk districts. The area of the park is .
Geology
The park is located at the southern edge of the Ukrainian crystalline shield in the spurs of the Podolian and Near-Dnipro Uplands. On the territory of the park the Southern Buh cuts into the crystalline massif (array) of the Ukrainian shield the outcome of which produced many rapids in the river. On the rocky banks are apparent types of the igneous rock that reveal granite.
The Granite-steppe lands of Buh represent the leftover spur of the ancient mountains once extending for 1000 km north-west to south-east from the Slovechansk-Ovruch mountain range to the Near-Azov Upland. As the result of the denudation process only the base of those mountains were left represented by the solid crystalline type of rock. Over the last 60 million years this part of land was not subjected to flooding.
Environment
The most predominant are the Chernozem type of soil that occupies 95% of the territory. The floodplain of the Southern Buh valley and the islands partially covered by the floodplain woods and meadows. The slopes of the valley retained the parts of the rocky (petrofit) steppe and leftovers of the grass-rich of the Gramineae- type and shrub-rich steppes.
On the territory of the landscape park grows around 900 species of vascular plants, with 26 of them listed in the Red Book of Ukraine. Also the park is inhabited by no less than 9000 species of insects (56 are in the Red Book) and about 300 species of vertebrate animals (46 - in the Red Book).
History
On the territory of the landscape park in the valley of the Southern Buh, between villages Mihiya and Oleksandrivka are found almost 100 archeological monuments that present a continuous chronological series of Paleolithic (dating 30,000 years BCE) to the times of the formation of the Slavic ethnos. The particular interest present the remains of various people: Cimmerians, Trypillians, Sarmatians, ancient Slavic peoples, Romans.
In the park is a well-known tract Buh Gard, a historic landscape of local cultural heritage (ref#173/0/16-06) and what remains from the Cossacks settlement and a former seat of one of the districts (palanka) of the Zaporizhian Host. In 2006 due to construction of the Tashlyk HAES the tract was unlawfully flooded without any known prosecutions followed.
In 19th century Viktor Skarzhynsky created in the place of the future landscape park an arboretum.
In 2008 the Granite steppes of Buh became of the Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine and later was nominated as the world wonder candidate.

Bullmoose was a Canadian rock band formed in Elgin, Ontario in 1996. Its members were twin brothers Jeff Cowan (drums/vocals) and Seamus Cowan (bass/vocals) from Westport, Ontario, and Eric Lawrance (guitar/vocals) from Delta, Ontario, who launched the band when they attended school in Montreal. The band performed in the rock music genre, citing experimental influences of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Bullmoose's independently released 2004 album Lessons Learned was recorded at Studio Piccolo in Montreal, engineered and co-produced by Bullmoose and Ryan Patterson (The Exchanges/Kill The Lights) with Mathieu Roberge, and mastered by Ryan Morey at SNB. The band toured throughout Canada in 2005 for the Night Danger Tour in support of the record.
Bullmoose performed at Canadian music festivals including Canadian Music Week, North By Northeast, Festival of the Islands, Ottawa Bluesfest, Festival International Maximum Blues, and Vancouver's Feb Fest. They played such venues as Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern, Montreal's Club Soda and The Brickyard in Vancouver. They also received substantial airplay on Kingston's KRock 105.7 with the single Poor Man's Hash. In the same year, the band also appeared on Made in Canada with Tootall on Montreal's CHOM-FM 97.7, and Underground Sounds on McGill University's CKUT-FM 90.3.
In 2007, Bullmoose released the album Speaker to Speaker.

John Donaldson (1799–1876) was Scottish agriculturalist, professor of Botany at the Royal Agricultural Training School, Hoddesdon, government land drainage surveyor, and author of prize essays works, best known as author of the 1854 Agricultural Biography.
Biography
Donaldson was born in Northumberland in 1799. He was probably related to James Donaldson (fl. 1794), writer on agriculture and land surveyor from Dundee, whose subjects he made his own.
In his early years in the 1820s Donalson had the management of large farms, and extensive estates, such as those of Loudon Castle in Ayrshire, and Donnington Park in Leicestershire, both in Scotland and England. In the 1840s Donaldson was appointed Head of Agricultural School at Hoddesdon, which at that time had just been established. In the title pages of his chief writings, Donaldson is described as "Professor of Botany" and "Government Land Drainage Survey." He was elected Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London.
Donaldson was presented to the Charterhouse by the Prince Consort in August 1855, and died a poor brother there on 22 March 1876, leaving a will in favour of Elizabeth Saine, a widow. In the year after his death a posthumous work on 'Suburban Farming' was edited by Robert Scott Burn.
Work
Donaldson is described by Fussell (1983) as "another of these Victorian goliaths whose output was large, and... was intimate with the writings of all his bucolic and farming literary ancestors."
His chief writings Agricultural Biography, (1854) : contains a chronological series of articles on the life and writings of the British authors on agriculture, from the earliest date in 1480 until the mid 19th century. It was considered a very useful specimen of biographical grouping, though the notices are often merely bibliographical.
His 1860 British Agriculture : Cultivation of Land, Management of Crops, Economy of Animals, is an elaborate compilation dedicated to the Duke of Argyll.

Marie-Geneviève Raphaëlle Halévy-Bizet-Straus (26 February 1849 – 22 December 1926) was a French salonnière who was the wife of Georges Bizet. She inspired Marcel Proust as a model for the Duchesse de Guermantes and Odette de Crécy in À la recherche du temps perdu.
Life
Geneviève Halévy was born in Paris as the youngest daughter of the composer Jacques-Fromental Halévy and his wife Léonie (née Rodrigues-Henriques), both Jewish. Geneviève Halévy's youth was sad: She lost her father when she was 13 years old, her elder sister when she was 15 years old, and her mother suffered from periods of mental instability. In 1869, she married Georges Bizet, a pupil of her father, and gave birth in 1871 to their son Jacques, who became a school friend of Marcel Proust. Bizet died suddenly of a heart attack in 1875.
Shortly after his death, Geneviève and Élie-Miriam Delaborde, a close friend of both her and Bizet, signed a marriage contract. Despite this, they never went through with the marriage. There have been speculations by scholars that Geneviève and Delaborde were having an affair during her marriage to Bizet, a theory seemingly confirmed by their marriage contract a year after Bizet's death.
Geneviève moved to live with her uncle, Léon Halévy, and opened a salon for her cousin Ludovic Halévy, where she helped him in receiving the artistic society of the time. This was known as Ludovic's Thursdays (Les jeudis de Ludovic). After a few years, she opened her own salon where distinguished society members, such as Baron and Baronness Alphonse de Rothschild, Comtesse Potocka, Duchesse de Richelieu, and Comtesse de Chevigné (née de Sade, another model for the Duchesse de Guermantes) could meet with writers and intellectuals such as Guy de Maupassant, Henri Meilhac, Georges de Porto-Riche, Paul Bourget, Paul Hervieu, Joseph Reinach, and her cousin Ludovic.
In 1886, she married the lawyer Émile Straus, an acquaintance of the Rothschild family, and her salon became increasingly fashionable: She received Robert de Montesquiou and his cousin Comtesse Greffulhe, painters and journalists. Many supporters of Dreyfus socialized at Mme Straus's salon, including Marcel Proust, who was one of the first intellectuals to sign a petition in L'Aurore at the time of the Dreyfus Affair. After the Affair, the salon became less prominent.
After 1910, Mme Straus became increasingly depressed, and removed herself from society. Her son committed suicide in 1922. A few weeks later, Proust died. She died in 1926 in Paris, aged 77.

Kim Harrison (born 1966) is a pen name of American author Dawn Cook. Kim is best known as the author of the New York Times #1 best selling Hollows series, but she has written more than urban fantasy and has published over two dozen books spanning the gamut from young adult, accelerated-science thriller, anthology, and a unique, full-color world book, and has scripted two original graphic novels set in the Hollows universe. She has also published traditional fantasy under the name Dawn Cook.
The Rachel Morgan urban fantasy series is set in an alternate history in which a worldwide pandemic caused by genetically modified tomatoes led to the death of a large portion of the world's human population. Under the name of Dawn Cook, she writes the Decoy Princess and Truth series, published in the first few years of the 21st century.
Harrison has received praise from fellow authors, and has reached the #1 spot on the New York Times Best Seller list.
On May 16, 2019, Harrison announced on social media that a new novel, American Demon, will be forthcoming in the summer of 2020.
Early life
Kim Harrison was born and raised in the Midwest. A self-proclaimed "former tomboy," she grew up the only girl in a family of boys. Despite her love of writing, she took an unorthodox approach to it, and claims to have avoided English courses beyond the basic requirements in high school and college.
Career
Harrison began her career with writing traditional science fiction, but began writing contemporary fantasy after deciding to focus more on character development. She spent the better part of a decade struggling as an aspiring author before meeting her current agent at a writing convention. He then introduced her to Diana Gill, who became Harrison's editor. Together, they produced Dead Witch Walking, and her first book was published in paperback by HarperTorch in 2004. Since then, she has written twelve more books, two graphic novels, and extensive world book in the Hollows series, also called the Rachel Morgan series, (most with titles punning off Clint Eastwood movies) and contributed to multiple anthologies, with prequels to the Hollows books, and one with a young adult story.
After the success of her first novel, Harrison was able to resign from her day job, devoting herself to writing full-time. Her favorite author is Ray Bradbury. She references music as one of her strongest writing influences, providing song lists for several of her characters. In her spare time, she communicates with fans via her self-maintained website and blog.
Harrison is a member of the International Thriller Writers.
The first two Truth books were originally one book, which was split into two separate books for publishing. That the two are the same, and that Cook was Harrison, was disclosed in a May 2009 Locus magazine article.
"I'm glad it's out in the open, because it is hard to maintain these two separate identities, and remind your friends or family when you go out, 'I'm Kim today, so don't call me Dawn.' The division has served its purpose. I'm still going to be Kim, but now if somebody calls me Dawn I won't have to say 'Shut your mouth!'"
Reception
Harrison has reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list and is generally recognized as one of the most successful and influential creators of urban fantasy. Her writing has garnered praise from numerous peers. Authors Kelly Gay and Courtney Allison Moulton have cited her as an inspiration. The Hollows series has also gained recognition from The New York Times and Amazon.com. In 2007, Amazon.com noted that Harrison had become "one of the hottest authors in the incredibly popular genre of sexy supernaturalism."

The 20 cm Luftminenwerfer M 16 (Pneumatic trench mortar) was a heavy mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was developed by Austria Metal Works in Brno from their earlier 12 cm Luftminenwerfer M 16. It was a rigid-recoil, smoothbore, breech-loading design that had to be levered around to aim at new targets. It was very simple in that the shell closed the top of the chamber and was retained by a "gripper" until the air pressure was deemed sufficient and the gripper was manually released, which fired the weapon. The barrel was fixed at 45° elevation and range was adjusted by varying the air pressure, but an additional barrel could be fitted to extend the range. A single cylinder of compressed air was only good for four to six shots. It was loaded onto a two-wheel cart for transport.
20 were ordered at the end of May 1916 after trials in the spring. Another 80 were ordered in November 1916. In service it was not as successful as its smaller brother due to its greater weight and much greater requirement for compressed air. It was superseded by the 26 cm Minenwerfer M 17.

Joseph Bonson (19 June 1936 – 29 November 1991) was an English professional footballer who played for several clubs during the 1950s and 1960s.
Career
Bonson started his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, working his way through their youth ranks including playing in the 1954 FA Youth Cup Final, losing to Manchester United. He graduated to the first team and made his debut on 1 January 1957 in a 3–2 win at Sunderland, the first of 11 consecutive starts during which he scored 6 goals. However, due to a wealth of striking talent at the club, he was deemed surplus to requirements and sold to Cardiff City for £7,000 at the end of the season.
He joined the Bluebirds as a replacement for Johnny Nicholls, who had left the club to join Exeter City and made a goalscoring debut for the club in a 1–1 draw with Ipswich Town in November 1957. He finished the season with 12 goals in a total of 25 appearances.
During his time at Cardiff he formed two formidable strike partnerships with two Wales internationals, first with Ron Hewitt and then with Derek Tapscott, after he joined the club from Arsenal. Bonsons's most prolific year came in the 1958–59 season when he scored 18 times for the club. At the end of the season he was transferred to Scunthorpe United in exchange for Peter Donnelly.
Bonson went on to spend the rest of his career playing in the lower leagues of English football with spells at Doncaster Rovers, Newport County, Brentford and Lincoln City.
He died in 1991.

Mr. Peabody's Apples is a picture book written by American entertainer Madonna, released on November 10, 2003, by Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The book contains a moral tale, inspired by a 300-year-old story by Rabbi Baal Shem Tov, that Madonna had heard from her Kabbalah teacher. Its main protagonist, Mr. Peabody, is subjected to rumors spread by a young boy and teaches him a lesson. Mr. Peabody's Apples is illustrated by Loren Long who took inspiration from American regionalist painters, and modeled the characters after real-life people.
Mr. Peabody's Apples was released in over 150 countries and 36 languages worldwide. It was the second children's book authored by Madonna, following The English Roses. She partnered with Audible stores and Apple Music for promotion, and also appeared on US talk shows. Critics gave mostly negative reviews of the book, criticizing the storytelling and absence of joy in it. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list.
Synopsis
History teacher Mr. Peabody organizes baseball games with other schools every Saturday. After each game, Mr. Peabody would clean up the field, with the help of a student named Billy Little. Then Mr. Peabody would walk home down the main street of Happville and pick out the shiniest apple from Mr. Funkadeli's market and put it in his pocket. One day, a student called Tommy Tittlebottom saw Mr. Peabody do this, and believed he was not paying for the apple. Tommy told his friends that Mr. Peabody was stealing the apples and gradually the word spread across town.
The following Saturday, Mr. Peabody wondered why no one showed up for the baseball game. Little Billy walked up to Mr. Peabody and told him everything. Mr. Peabody took Billy to Mr. Funkadeli's market where Billy realized that Mr. Peabody paid for the apples every Saturday morning when he picked up his milk. Astonished, Billy went to find Tommy and explained everything. Later that day, Tommy showed up at Mr. Peabody's house and apologized, asking how he could make it up to him. Mr. Peabody told Tommy to meet him at the bleachers with a feather pillow.
Later that day, Mr. Peabody had Tommy cut open the pillow at the top of the bleachers and let all the feathers fly away across the field. He asked Tommy to go and pick up the feathers which Tommy thought would be impossible. It was then Mr. Peabody reminded Tommy that it is impossible to undo the damage he had done spreading the rumor that Mr. Peabody was a thief.
Background and conception
In 2003, American singer Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment and released her first children's book as an author, The English Roses, which was translated into 42 different languages over 100 countries. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, spending a total of 18 weeks there. Following the success of The English Roses, Madonna worked on her second book, Mr. Peabody's Apples. In the acknowledgement section, Madonna dedicated the book to "teachers everywhere", while including a moral about the how to choose one's words carefully and the effects of it. She explained that Mr. Peabody's Apples was inspired by a 300 year-old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov that she heard from her Kabbalah teacher, and wanted to share the "essence" of it in her second release.
Callaway and Madonna wanted the story to be set in the 1940s, during a day in the life of a small town told in a cinematic style. An article in The Times described it as evoking "the highly moral world of Jimmy Stewart and It's a Wonderful Life, of apple pie, picket fences, Little League baseball, milkshakes and—of course—of right and wrong". The pictures were illustrated by Loren Long whose main inspiration was American regionalist artists and conventional realism. Long based Mr. Peabody on a car mechanic who lived in his hometown of Joplin, Missouri while Billy Little was based on his own son Griffith. For illustrating Tommy Tittlebottom as the main antagonist, Long used local resident Jonathan Whitney as a model, after seeing his mischievous nature, comparing him the cartoon character Dennis the Menace. Whitney's mother initially had reservations permitting Long to use her son, but agreed due to "Madonna's reputation as a mother".
Mr. Peabody's Apples was released on November 10, 2003, in over 150 countries and 36 languages worldwide. For the release of the book, Madonna partnered with Audible online stores and Apple Music. It included two interviews with the singer on Radio KOL, and a teaser clip of Madonna narrating the story on AOL. The initial print-run of the book was 130,000 according to The Bookseller magazine. Publisher Nicholas Callaway said that the book would be simultaneously launched on online, print and audio media stores. Madonna appeared at different events, including the book fair at Montclair Kimberley Academy, to launch the book, and read excerpts from it in front of a live audience. She also appeared on television talk shows like The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Live with Kelly and Ryan and Late Show with David Letterman to promote the book.
Critical and commercial reception
Mr. Peabody's Apples debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, and remained atop the list for three weeks. By October 2004, it had sold 127,000 copies according to Nielsen BookScan. In Estonia, the book sold 4,000 units. The book was not received well critically. Samantha Critchell from The Associated Press called the book "a little hokey". The critic believed that it would be a big seller, but the premise was "stale" since the target was young readers and grade-school going children, who might not respond well to a tale of moral. "You'd think that a celebrity with Madonna's notoriety [...] wouldn't need a centuries-old story to inspire her to write about the value of truth and the pain that comes with gossip that spreads like wildfire," the reviewer concluded. Deirdre Donahue from USA Today panned the release, especially Madonna naming a character Billy Little just because he is short. Donahue found the story to lack depth unlike the previous release, The English Roses, and declared Mr. Peabody's Apples as "a dreary, heavy-handed tale" with a "pedestrian and predictable" message.
Reviewing the book for Tablet, Ayelet Waldman felt that neither Mr. Peabody's Apples nor The English Roses "will be added to the list of approved reading material kept by the world's Jewish grandmothers", although she believed that the former book contained a simple moral and "nice" metaphor. American writer E. Lockhart reviewed the book for Salon under her real name Emily Jenkins. She found Madonna's second endeavor to be "neither bouncy nor flirty", rather described it as "dour and joyless, despite the pretty masculinity of Loren Long's Norman Rockwell-style illustrations. Jenkins noted that children were depicted in the book as " passive receptors of adult wisdom, but here, the misguided semi-protagonist ends up in a guilty, never-to-be-redeemed limbo for his relatively innocent crime".
A review in the Publishers Weekly was critical of the story, but praised Long's illustrations, describing them as "lushly nostalgic gouaches, with their robin's-egg blue skies, bountiful golden farmlands and working men in straw hats and rolled sleeves, pay homage to the rural paintings of Thomas Hart Benton." Similar thoughts were echoed by Tim Adams from The Guardian, who believed that the story was saved by "Long's glorious illustrations which cast Norman Rockwell light on Mad magazine faces". Nicolette Jones from The Times found the story to be "more coherent than its predecessor [The English Roses], lacks its irritating conversational asides and has more sense of time and place".

In the antebellum and Reconstruction era South, most cotton planters relied on cotton factors (also known as cotton brokers) to sell their crops for them.
Description
The cotton factor was usually located in an urban center of commerce, such as Charleston, Mobile, New Orleans, or Savannah (harbor cities; there was not yet a network of railroads), where they could most efficiently tend to business matters for their rural clients. Prior to the American Civil War, the states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi were producing more than half of the world's cotton, but Arkansas, Tennessee, and Texas produced large amounts also. At the same time, the port of New Orleans exported the most cotton, followed by the port of Mobile. Cotton factors also frequently purchased goods for their clients, and even handled shipment of those goods to the clients, among other services.
As one source notes,
The factor was a versatile man of business in an agrarian society who performed many different services for the planter in addition to selling his crops. He purchased or sold slaves for his client, arranged for the hiring of slaves or the placing of the planter's children in distant schools, gave advice concerning the condition of the market or the advisability of selling or withholding his crop, and bought for his client a large proportion of the plantation supplies.
Not all factors in the antebellum and Reconstruction era South were cotton factors; some were factors of other commodities. In 1858, for example, New Orleans boasted sixty-three sugar and molasses factors. Louisiana produced large amounts of sugar cane, but it probably had an even greater number of cotton factors.

Praphas Charusathien (, , ; 25 November 1912 – 18 August 1997) was a Thai military officer and politician. He was a field marshal (chom phon) of the Royal Thai Army and minister of interior in the governments of military rulers Sarit Thanarat and Thanom Kittikachorn.
Personal life and education
Praphas graduated from the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and became an infantry officer. He was sponsored by Field Marshal and Prime Minister-to-be Sarit Thanarat. He was quickly promoted to higher ranks. In 1957, Sarit appointed him minister of interior, a position in which he continued to serve after Sarit's death in 1963. The new Prime Minister was Thanom Kittikachorn, whose son married Praphas' daughter. From 1963 to 1973, he was additionally deputy prime minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army. During this time, Praphas was the strong man in the background who pulled the strings in the Thanom government. He was known for obscure financial transactions and political intrigues, while sitting on the boards of 44 companies.
In 1973, he was replaced as army commander by Gen.Krit Srivara, which signaled his loss of influence. In October 1973 protests against the rigid military rule grew into a massive popular uprising that was answered by a bloody crackdown on the protesting students and democracy activists. The many dead civilians prompted King Bhumibol Adulyadej to intervene. Praphas, Thanom and his son Col.Narong Kittikachorn went into exile.
Praphas returned to Thailand in January 1977, after the military had ended the democratic interlude in October 1976. However, he was not able to exercise political influence again.
Family
Praphas married to Thanpuying Sawai Jarusathien, daughter of Lt. Von and Huai Panprasit. They have a total of 6 children. Praphas's children were married to important people with military and political power, including Supaporn Charusathien married with Narong Kittikachorn son of Thanom Kittikachorn, Orapan Charusathien married with Yuthasak Sasiprapha and Supanapa Charusathien married with Somtat Attanand.
Died
Praphas Charusathien died on 18 August 1997 in Bangkok.

Paul Tutmarc (May 29, 1896 – September 25, 1972) was an American musician and musical instrument inventor. He was a tenor singer and a performer and teacher of the lap steel guitar and the ukulele. He developed a number of variant types of stringed musical instruments, such as electrically amplified double basses, bass guitar, and lap steel guitars. His second marriage was to his former student Bonnie Buckingham, known as Bonnie Guitar.
Career
As a child, Tutmarc sang in a church choir. As pre-teen, he sang and played guitar and banjo, and in his teens, he played Hawaiian-style acoustic steel guitar. He worked with a traveling vaudeville troupe. In his early 20s, Tutmarc moved to Seattle to work in the dock-area shipyards. In the mid-1920s, Tutmarc became known for his tenor voice. In the late 1920s, he performed on the radio and in a variety of theaters.
In the very early 1930s, Tutmarc began teaching guitar and experimenting with the electrification (and amplification) of various instruments including a piano, zither, and a Spanish-style guitar by using a wire-wrapped magnet as a "pickup" that could be amplified through a modified Atwater-Kent brand radio.
Tutmarc's Audiovox Manufacturing Co. was one of the first firms to produce an electric lap steel guitar, and Tutmarc himself was often the demonstrator and promoter. He invented a solid-body electric upright "bull-fiddle" in 1935 but it mainly served as a publicity tool. He manufactured lap steel guitars with his own "blade" pickup, and accompanying amplifiers. His real claim-to-fame was the development and marketing of the fretted and solid-body Audiovox Model 736 Bass Fiddle, from 1936, which was designed to be used in a horizontal position. That then-radical instrument is considered to be history's earliest electric bass guitar—and one that preceded the far more famous Fender Precision Bass by a decade and a half. Tutmarc also manufactured an accompanying bass amplifier, the Audiovox Model 936.
The Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle has an original Audiovox 736 Bass, found by historian Peter Blecha in the late 1990s.
In March 2018 an original Audiovox 736 bass, one of four reported to still exist, was sold at auction for US$23,000.
Tutmarc continued performing until the late 1960s, and he kept on teaching until he died of cancer on September 25, 1972.
Personal life
Tutmarc married his first wife Lorraine in 1921; their two children Jeanne and Paul Jnr. (known as "Bud") were born in 1922 and 1924 respectively. In 1944 Tutmarc married, and later recorded with, his former student Bonnie Buckingham, known as Bonnie Guitar (1923–2019). Together they had one child, Paula, (1950–2013).
Bonnie and Paul split in 1955. Both Bonnie and Paula pursued their music careers; Paula under various stage names including Alexys, Iris Hill, and Cookie Irene.
Bud Tutmarc followed in his father's footsteps as a musician, playing the Hawaiian steel guitar, and instrument manufacturer. Bud Tutmarc's Serenader Bass was derived from his father's invention. Paul Tutmarc's great-grandson Shane Tutmarc is also a musician.

Charles Everett Traynor (August 21, 1937 – July 22, 2002) was an American businessman and talent agent best known for having promoted the careers of pornographic film stars Linda Lovelace and Marilyn Chambers, both of whom were also married to him. Lovelace wrote in her autobiography Ordeal (1980) that Traynor was abusive during their marriage and had threatened and coerced her into her role in the pornographic film Deep Throat (1972).
Career
Traynor was a minor figure in the early US East Coast pornographic film industry and appeared in a number of short "loops" in the early 1970s, usually with his then-wife, Linda Lovelace. He was the production manager of the 1972 movie Deep Throat.
Relationship with Linda Lovelace
In a 1980 article in Ms. magazine, "The Real Linda Lovelace", Gloria Steinem discussed Traynor and Lovelace's relationship. Steinem stated that "the myth that Lovelace loved to be sexually used and humiliated was created by her husband" and that he kept her as his prisoner. Lovelace claimed that Traynor forced her into prostitution by threatening her with a gun, repeatedly beat her, forced her to make pornography, and allowed men to rape her repeatedly. Lovelace tried to escape from Traynor three times before she was successful. She said that during Deep Throat one can see scars and bruises left on her legs from a beating by Traynor. According to Steinem, Traynor once stated, "When I first dated [Linda] she was so shy, it shocked her to be seen nude by a man... I created Linda Lovelace."
In 1979, Lovelace underwent a polygraph examination in which she repeated allegations she made against Traynor. During the session the test results supported the following allegations:
In 1971, Traynor forced Lovelace to have sex with five men for money in the Coral Gables Holiday Inn. He pointed a gun at Lovelace and threatened to kill her if she refused.
During her relationship with Traynor, Lovelace feared for her life if she tried to leave him.
He would hypnotize her.
He asked her to help him run the prostitution business, and when she refused he hit her. He used to beat her occasionally, which seemed to sexually excite him. He beat her the night before their wedding and during the filming of Deep Throat.
After she left him, Traynor threatened to shoot her sister's son if she did not return.
When out with other people, he would tell her not to speak, and she had to ask his permission to use the toilet.
The movie Deep Throat made approximately $600 million but Lovelace did not receive any money from the film and said that her husband received around $1,250 for the project. Traynor kept control of the money.
In a Vanity Fair article on Marilyn Chambers, whom Traynor married after Lovelace divorced him, Traynor said he considered himself a country boy in that he could live away from civilization and that if his woman said something he didn't like, he thought nothing of hitting her for it.
Lovelace's allegations against Traynor have been disputed since she voiced them but in the second commentary on the DVD of "Inside Deep Throat," one member of the production crew of Deep Throat backed up Lovelace's allegation of a brutal beating that she claimed left bruises that are visible in the film. The man said his motel room was next to Lovelace and Traynor's and emphatically stated that Traynor beat Lovelace viciously at night. Marilyn Chambers later claimed that Linda's allegations "hurt Chuck," but Deep Throat, Part 2 actress Andrea True said that most people did not like Chuck Traynor and sided with Lovelace as to her allegations.
Traynor was portrayed by actor Peter Sarsgaard in the 2013 film Lovelace.
Death
Traynor died at the age of 64 of a heart attack in Chatsworth, California, on July 22, 2002, three months after Lovelace died from massive trauma and internal injuries as a result of a car accident in Colorado. Lovelace's sister, Barbara Boreman, later said in an interview in Inside Deep Throat that she was disappointed that Traynor died before she could kill him.
In media
The song "I'm Coming Up Your Ass" from Great White Death (album) is "dedicated to Chuck Traynor".
Peter Sarsgaard starred as Chuck Traynor in the biographical film Lovelace based on his first wife.

Kacie Fischer is the first woman to inline skate across the United States, a feat she accomplished in 2012. She is the fastest person to ever do so, skating from California to Florida in 47 days; the previous official record was 69 days, by Rusty Montcrief in 2002. Danny Dannels reportedly did it in 67 days, but that is unofficial. Fischer skated to raise money for the Special Olympics. In addition to skating, Fischer is a personal trainer, CrossFit Coach, fitness lead at Inline Warehouse, and professional tower runner (someone who races up stairwells of skyscrapers). She and Adam Cleveland, who was then her fiancé, started the nonprofit organization LiveGiveSkate.org. While at college she suffered from heart failure, which prompted her to begin a vigorous athletic regimen.

Robert Abela (born 7 December 1977) is a Maltese lawyer and politician who has served as Prime Minister of Malta and Leader of Labour Party since 2020. The son of former President George Abela, he was elected to Parliament in 2017. Abela was sworn in as Prime Minister following the resignation of Joseph Muscat on 13 January 2020.
Early life, family and professional career
Born in Sliema in the Northern Harbour District, to George Abela, former President of Malta (2009–2014) and his wife Margaret (née Cauchi). Abela grew up with his sister Marija in Għaxaq and Marsaskala in the south of Malta. Their mother, Margaret, worked in the administration of the Old University in Valletta and later managed the family's law firm. Robert attended the Sisters' School in Santa Luċija and St Francis primary school in Bormla, to then continue secondary school and sixth form at St Aloysius' College.
A football player in his youth, he played in goal for the national youth team. Abela also practised bodybuilding, competing twice in the national championships in the late 1990s.
Abela studied law at the University of Malta, where he met his future wife Lydia. He graduated in 2002. Following his graduation, he worked in the family's Abela Advocates law firm, specializing in industrial and labour law.
His law firm's contract with Malta's Planning Authority predates Labour's election in 2013 and has been renewed yearly since. Abela has been criticised for benefiting from direct orders for legal services for public entities, including Enemalta and Transport Malta. In 2018, Robert Abela declared that no conflict of interest arose from his acting as legal representative of Air Malta while his father, former President George Abela, was the mediator and chief negotiator in talks with its pilots.
After 2013, Abela Advocates held a licence (IIP 161) for the sale of Maltese citizenship (Individual Investors Programme), in the name of Robert's wife Lydia. The licence was dropped in early 2020 once Abela became Prime Minister.
In 2008, he married Lydia Abela Zerafa (née Zerafa), who later took the role of secretary of the Labour Party executive committee. They have a daughter, Giorgia Mae, born in 2012.
Politics
Abela became involved in politics while his father George Abela was deputy party leader, supporting the party in the 1996 general election. He claimed that he started off transporting sick people to the polling stations in 1996, and worked behind the scenes for many years in other roles, such as representing the party on current affairs programmes as requested by Joseph Muscat and lately as his legal advisor in Cabinet. He also supported his father in the failed Labour leadership bid against Joseph Muscat in 2008, after Alfred Sant's resignation.
On 25 January 2017, Abela highlighted that a patch of land in his native Qormi was seriously undervalued during the previous Partit Nazzjonalista administration, where contractors paid €0.9 million instead of the full value of €8 million.
Abela was described as appealing to voters with no political ties, as well as the perfect replacement to attract Marie Louise Coleiro Preca's votes in the sixth district of Siggiewi, Luqa and Qormi. He had already been approached; however, he chose his legal profession over politics.
Member of the Parliament of Malta
In June 2017, at the age of 40, he was elected to the Parliament of Malta after his first attempt at contesting the sixth district, including Siggiewi, Luqa and Qormi, was successful. He also served as legal adviser to the Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, which enabled him to attend the meetings of the Council of Ministers. The Opposition claimed that his private consultancy contracts with the Planning Authority and Transport Malta earned him at least €580,000.
In October 2019 Abela stated that more Police were needed on Malta's streets to tackle residents' migration-related concerns.
In his years at the Parliament, Abela was never an outspoken critic of Muscat; in the fallout of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder, he remarked that he would have "acted earlier" to remove minister Konrad Mizzi and chief of staff Keith Schembri from their posts had he been the leader.
2020 Labour leadership race
Following the announcement of Joseph Muscat's upcoming resignation due to the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and the ensuing protests, deputy prime minister Chris Fearne was considered the front-runner to replace Muscat as leader of the party and Prime Minister, and other hopefuls (including Ian Borg and Miriam Dalli) were reportedly pressured not to run in order to allow a quick transition by Christmas 2019 with the formality of a vote by party members for a single candidate. Robert Abela remarked that he did not want to be a part of any "diabolical pact", and presented his candidacy as an alternative to Chris Fearne.
However, according to James Debono, Abela was soon recognised as the "continuity" candidate instead of Fearne, emphasizing stability, unity and normality, as opposed to the bolder changes advocated by Fearne.
Abela's leadership campaign was focused on party members and aimed at striking a chord with the traditional Labour themes (social housing, free medicines for the elderly and better employment conditions for blue-collar workers) while distancing himself from the coziness of Muscat with big business. He also called for a crack-down on cheap labour migrant workers, who he accused of repressing local salaries, by proposing that employers be allowed to hire foreigners only if able to pay them fully on the books and while respecting work condition regulations. He also guaranteed the continuation of Malta's controversial citizenship-by-investment programme.
Abela, a backbencher with no ministerial experience, presented himself as a candidate of continuity, pledging to maintain the same cabinet as Muscat's, as well as the same staff at the powerful Office of the Prime Minister, in opposition to Chris Fearne, whose campaign for a clean slate at Castille created apprehension among insiders.
Abela was openly critical of the 2019 Malta political crisis surrounding the Daphne Caruana Galizia car bombing.
In fact, on 28 November 2019, he claimed that the Labour Party would need deep rooted changes rather than superficial ones.
Abela also claimed that the only purpose of the 2019 Maltese protests was provocation.
Abela stated that his family law firm headed by his wife should retain the right to bid for public tenders, should he take up office. Following controversies, he later backtracked and committed not to seek public contracts for his family law firm.
His campaign was criticised for not accepting any interviews from the independent press, but only relying on Labour-friendly media outlets.
Leader of Labour Party and Prime Minister
At the internal party elections on 12 January 2020, Abela obtained 9,342 votes against 6,798 for Chris Fearne. Over 92% of MLP members cast their vote in party clubs across the country. Abela was thus proclaimed new leader of the Labour Party.
The following day Joseph Muscat resigned from the post of Prime Minister. President George Vella accepted Muscat's resignation and appointed Abela as new Prime Minister of Malta. His first official appointment was that of Clyde Caruana as his chief of staff.

Memory allocation is a process that determines which specific synapses and neurons in a neural network will store a given memory. Although multiple neurons can receive a stimulus, only a subset of the neurons will induce the necessary plasticity for memory encoding. The selection of this subset of neurons is termed neuronal allocation. Similarly, multiple synapses can be activated by a given set of inputs, but specific mechanisms determine which synapses actually go on to encode the memory, and this process is referred to as synaptic allocation. Memory allocation was first discovered in the lateral amygdala by Sheena Josselyn and colleagues in Alcino J. Silva's laboratory.
At the neuronal level, cells with higher levels of excitability (for example lower slow afterhyperpolarization) are more likely to be recruited into a memory trace, and substantial evidence exists implicating the cellular transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein) in this process. Certain synapses on recruited neurons are more likely to undergo an enhancement of synaptic strength (known as Long-term potentiation (LTP)) and proposed mechanisms that might contribute to allocation at the synaptic level include synaptic tagging, capture, and synaptic clustering.
Neuronal allocation
Neuronal allocation is a phenomenon that accounts for how specific neurons in a network, and not others that receive similar input, are committed to storing a specific memory.
The role of CREB in neuronal allocation
The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a well-studied mechanism of neuronal memory allocation. Most studies to date use the amygdala as a model circuit, and fear-related memory traces in the amygdala are mediated by CREB expression in the individual neurons allocated to those memories. CREB modulates cellular processes that lead to neuronal allocation, particularly with regards to dendritic spine density and morphology. Many of the memory mechanisms studied to date are conserved across different brain regions, and it is likely that the mechanisms of fear-based memory allocation found in the amygdala will also be similarly present for other types of memories throughout different brain regions. Indeed, Sano and colleagues in the Silva lab showed that CREB also regulates neuronal memory allocation in the amygdala.
CREB may be activated by multiple pathways. For example, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways appear to participate in neuronal allocation. When activated by the second messengers such as cAMP and calcium ions, enzymes such as PKA and MAP kinase can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate CREB to initiate transcription of target genes. PKA inhibitors can block the development of long-lasting LTP, and this is accompanied by a reduction in the transcription of genes modulated by the CREB protein.
Metaplasticity in neuronal allocation
Metaplasticity is a term describing the likelihood that a given stimulus will induce neuronal plasticity, based on the previous activity experienced by that neuron. Several studies provide evidence that neurons receiving “priming activity” (such as neurotransmitters, paracrine signals, or hormones) minutes to days prior will show a lower threshold for induction of long term potentiation (LTP). Other studies find that activation of NMDARs can also raise the stimulation threshold for induction of LTP. Thus, similar inputs on groups of neurons may induce LTP in some but not others based on prior activity of those neurons.
Signaling mechanisms implicated in these metaplastic effects include autophosphorylation of αCaMKII, changes in NMDA receptor subunit composition, and activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. These metaplastic effects regulate memory destabilization and reconsolidation.
Synaptic allocation
Synaptic allocation pertains to mechanisms that influence how synapses come to store a given memory. Intrinsic to the idea of synaptic allocation is the concept that multiple synapses can be activated by a given set of inputs, but specific mechanisms determine which synapses actually go on to encode the memory. Allocation of memories to specific synapses are key to determining where memories are stored.
Synaptic tagging and capture
Synaptic activity can generate a synaptic tag, which is a marker that allows the stimulated spine to subsequently capture newly transcribed plasticity molecules such as Arc. Synaptic activity can also engage the translation and transcription machinery. Weak stimulation can create synaptic tags but will not engage the translation and transcription machinery, whereas strong stimulation will create synaptic tags and also engage the translation and transcription machinery. Newly generated plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) can be captured by any tagged synapses, but untagged synapses are not eligible to receive new PPs. After a certain time period, synapses will lose their tag and return to their initial state. Furthermore, the supply of new PRPs will deplete. The tags and new PRPs must overlap in time to capture the PRPs.
The synaptic tag is inversely related to time between inducing stimuli, and is said to be temporarily asymmetrical. Furthermore, the tagging is also inversely related to the distance between spines, an important spatial property of tagging. Conversely confirming the temporal and spatial properties of the synaptic tagging, subsequent imaging studies revealed that there are not only temporal constraints but also structural constraints that limit synaptic tagging and capture mechanisms. Overall, these studies demonstrate the complexity of synaptic tagging and capture, and give further insight into how exactly this mechanism occurs.
Spine clustering
Synaptic clustering refers to the addition of new spines to a dendritic area where other spines have been added by previous learning. Spine clustering may result in the amplification of synaptic inputs via diffusible molecular crosstalk that occurs near activated spines.1 For example, studies have shown that signaling molecules synthesized at one spine, (e.g. activated RAS and/or RHOA), may diffuse out and influence spine growth at nearby sites. The Rho GTPase CDC42 may also contribute to spine clustering by driving long-term spine volume increases. Recent studies also suggest that this process may be regulated by NMDA receptor activation and nitric oxide stimulation.
Spine clustering in the motor cortex reflects a morphological mechanism for synaptic storage of specific motor memories. These clustered spines are more stable than non-clustered new spines. This type of addition of spines occurs in a specific pattern, meaning that spines added after one task will not cluster with spines after an alternative task. Loss of spine clustering is also a possibility as shown in some fear conditioning experiments, leading to the net loss of spines in the frontal association cortex, a region strongly associated in fear conditioning, which strongly correlates with memory on recall. Once spines were added after fear extinction had a similar orientation to the spines lost during the original fear conditioning.
Mechanisms that link memories across time
Denise Cai in Alcino J. Silva's laboratory found that memory allocation mechanisms are used to connect or link memories across time. In their studies they demonstrated that one contextual memory triggers the activation of CREB and subsequent enhancements in excitability in a subset of hippocampal CA1 neurons, such that a subsequent contextual memory, occurring within 5 hours, can be allocated to some of the same CA1 neurons that stored the first contextual memory. As a consequence of this overlap between the CA1 memory engrams for the two contextual memories, recall of one contextual memory activates the retrieval of the second memory. These studies also showed that contextual memory linking mechanisms are disrupted in the aging brain, and that increasing excitability in a subset of CA1 neurons reverses these memory linking deficits. It is very likely that impairments in CREB and neuronal excitability in aging brains could account for abnormalities in memory linking and possibly related source memory problems (source amnesia) associated with aging. In July 2018, in a special issue about "13 Discoveries that Could Change Everything", Scientific American highlighted the Silva laboratory's discovery of Memory Allocation and Linking
Current and future research
Integrating synaptic and neuronal allocation
Experiments have yet to investigate the interaction of allocative mechanisms between the neuronal and synaptic levels. The two classes of processes are very likely to be interconnected considering the relationship between neurons and synapses in a neuronal network. For example, the synaptic tagging and capture involved in synaptic allocation requires the allocation of the neurons to which the synapses belong to. Moreover, increases in neuronal excitability in a given neuronal ensemble may affect some dendrites more than others, thus biasing memory storage to synapses in dendrites with higher excitability. Similarly, on the recruited neurons displaying increased excitability, specific synapses need to be selected for in order to store the information in the form of synaptic plasticity.
One aspect of integration involves metaplasticity and how acquisition and storage of one memory changes the neural circuit to affect the storage and properties of a subsequent memory. Cellular excitability has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for heterosynaptic metaplasticity, the modulation of subsequent plasticity at different synapses. CREB functions through elevating cell excitability as described above, thus it is also possibly involved in hetrerosynaptic metaplasticity. Synaptic tagging and capture, as introduced in sections above, can result in a weak memory (capable of triggering only E-LTP), which would otherwise be forgotten, but it can be strengthened and stabilized by a strong memory (capable of triggering L-LTP), which is a form of heterosynaptic plasticity.
Future research
Despite extensive research into the individual mechanisms of memory allocation, there are few studies investigating the integration of these mechanisms. It has been proposed that understanding the implications of the molecular, cellular and systemic mechanisms of these processes may elucidate how they are coordinated and integrated during memory formation. For example, identifying the plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) involved in synaptic tagging and capture as well as the upstream and downstream molecules of CREB can help reveal potential interactions. Investigating the functional significance of these mechanisms will require tools that can directly manipulate and image the processes involved in the proposed mechanisms in vivo. For instance, it is possible that the behavioral interactions ascribed to synaptic tagging and capture are caused by protein synthesis-dependent increases in neuromodulators such as dopamine rather than by synaptic tagging mechanisms. Examining the behavioral effects under direct manipulation can help rule out these other possible causes.

Beringa Reserve, formerly known as Peniup Creek Reserve, is a 25.06 km2 nature reserve in south-west Western Australia. It lies about 380 km south-east of Perth. It is owned and managed by Bush Heritage Australia (BHA), by which it was purchased jointly with Greening Australia (WA) in 2007, and forms part of the Gondwana Link project, in which BHA is a partner.
Flora and fauna
The reserve protects yate, mallet and moort woodland as well as mallee heath vegetation and riparian communities along the upper Peniup Creek. Much of the reserve was previously cleared and is now regenerating or planned to be revegetated. Animals either recorded, or expected to be present, include black-gloved wallaby, tammar wallaby and red-tailed phascogale.
The nearby Peniup Nature Reserve is used for the DEC recovery program for the Dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis), an attempt to conserve this endangered species by its reintroduction.

Mary Lou Mackey (born 1945) is an American novelist, poet, and academic. She is the author of eight collections of poetry and fourteen novels, including the New York Times best-seller A Grand Passion and The Village of Bones, The Year The Horses Came, The Horses At The Gate, and The Fires of Spring, four sweeping historical novels that take as their subject the earth-centered, Goddess-worshiping cultures of Neolithic Europe. In 2012, her sixth collection of poetry, Sugar Zone, won a PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award. Another collection, The Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams: New and Selected Poems 1974 to 2018, won a 2018 Women's Spirituality Book Award from the California Institute of Integral Studies; and the 2019 Eric Hoffer Small Press Award for the best book published by a small press. Her first novel, Immersion (Shameless Hussy Press, 1972), was the first novel published by a Second Wave feminist press. Long concerned with environmental issues, Mackey frequently writes about the rainforests of Costa Rica and the Brazilian Amazon. In the early 1970s, as Professor of English and Writer-In-Residence at California State University, Sacramento, she was instrumental in the founding of the CSUS Women's Studies Program and the CSUS English Department Graduate Creative Writing Program. From 1989-1992, she served as President of the West Coast Branch of PEN American Center involving herself in PEN's international defense of persecuted writers.
Biography
Mary Mackey was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. Her father was a physician. Her mother worked as a chemist in the Mead Johnson laboratories during World War II. Mackey graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude with a major in English. While there, she came under the influence of the father of modern ethnobotany, Richard Evans Schultes, to whom she attributes a lifelong interest in botany and ecology, themes which often appear in her novels and poetry. During her twenties, she lived in field stations in the then-remote jungles of Costa Rica. After receiving her Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the University of Michigan, she moved to California to become Professor of English and Writer-in-Residence at California State University, Sacramento (CSUS). She is married to Angus Wright, CSUS Emeritus Professor of Environmental Studies, with whom she frequently travels to Brazil.
Mackey was one of the founders of the CSUS Women's Studies Program. She also founded the CSUS English Department Graduate Creative Writing Program along with poet Dennis Schmitz and novelist Richard Bankowsky. In 1978 Mackey founded The Feminist Writers' Guild with poets Adrienne Rich and Susan Griffin, author Charlene Spretnak, and novelist Valerie Miner. From 1989-1992, Mackey served as President of the West Coast Branch of PEN American Center involving herself in PEN's international defense of persecuted writers. Mackey retired from California State University in 2008. As of 2020, she continues to write novels and poetry.
Works
Mackey is the author of fourteen novels and eight collections of poetry. She is noted for her historical fiction, particularly for The Village of Bones, The Year The Horses Came, The Horses At The Gate, and The Fires of Spring, a series set in Neolithic Europe which Mackey based on the research of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. She is also noted for her lyric poetry which has been praised by Wendell Berry, Jane Hirshfield, Maxine Hong Kingston, Dennis Nurkse, Ron Hansen, Dennis Schmitz, and Marge Piercy for its beauty, precision, originality, and extraordinary range.
Her first novel, Immersion (Shameless Hussy Press, 1972) is set in the rain forests of Costa Rica. It takes as its subjects ecology and feminism, and is believed to be the first feminist novel published by a Second Wave American feminist press. McCarthy's List is a comic novel set in Indianapolis in the 1950s. The Last Warrior Queen retells the myth of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. A Grand Passion and The Kindness of Strangers is set in Europe and take as their subject three generations of women involved in the arts. Four of Mackey's novels (The Village of Bones, The Year The Horses Came, The Horses At The Gate, and The Fires of Spring) comprise her Earthsong Series. Set in Europe in the Neolithic Period, they deal with struggles between matristic earth-centered goddess-worshiping cultures and invading patriarchal nomads. Mackey's Season of Shadows is set at Harvard in the late 60's and deals with various political issues such as the Civil Rights Movement and protests against the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. In 2003 and 2004, in a departure from her previous styles and themes, Mackey chose to write The Stand-In and Sweet Revenge under the pen name "Kate Clemens." Both are comic novels set in Los Angeles. She wrote two Civil War novels, The Notorious Mrs. Winston and The Widow's War, which are set in Indiana and Kansas, respectively.
Mackey's poetry is hard to classify. Critics have called it "fierce," "surreal," "ecstatic," "passionately transcendent," and "corrosive," and noted her "hallucinatory troping" which is "continually deconstructing rational consciousness." In speaking of Mackey's collection Breaking The Fever, poet Jane Hirshfield noted: "The poetry in Breaking the Fever offers truths both personal & political, visions both actual and imaginatively broad …, set down with a sensuous, compassionate, and utterly unflinching eye." On several occasions, Garrison Keillor read Mackey's poems on his daily radio show and podcast The Writer's Almanac. In 2011, Marsh Hawk Press published Mackey's sixth collection of poetry, Sugar Zone which won the 2012 PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award. Her eighth collection, The Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams: New and Selected Poems 1974 to 2018, won a Women's Spirituality Book Award from the California Institute of Integral Studies; and the Eric Hoffer Small Press Award for the best book published by a small press. Mackey has said that many of her poems are inspired by the extremely high fevers she has experienced on multiple occasions and by the works of Brazilian novelists and poets, noting that often they "combine Portuguese and English as incantation to evoke the lyrical space that lies at the conjunction between the two languages." In 2014 Marsh Hawk published a new collection of Mackey's poetry Travelers With No Ticket Homeabout which The Huffington Post said: "It is difficult to resist the temptation to compare Mary Mackey to Elizabeth Bishop. Both poets are stunningly imagistic and musical." In 2018, when Mackey's The Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams: New and Selected Poems 1974 to 2018 was published, PANK magazine noted that: “Mackey is a magnificent thinker with broad passions: pagan cultures, literature, anthropology, ecology and history ... [whose] work, while stunningly layered, is always accessible.” “Mary Mackey,” said Tulsa Book Review, “is a national treasure. Her poetry resonates with feminism and the world of nature without any trace of didacticism. This is her eighth collection of poetry, and we are better for it.”
Mary Mackey's literary papers are archived in the Sophia Smith Special Collections Library, Smith College, Northampton, MA. Her collection of rare editions of small press poetry books authored by Northern California poets is archived in the Smith College Mortimer Rare Book Room.

James Battle Avirett (March 12, 1835 – February 16, 1912) was an American Confederate chaplain and author. He was the first chaplain commissioned to serve in the Confederate States Army in 1861. His The Old Plantation: How We Lived in Great House and Cabin before the War, published in 1901 was a nostalgic description of life on a plantation in the Antebellum South. By the time of his death, he was "the last surviving Confederate chaplain."
Early life
James Battle Avirett was born on March 12, 1835, in Richlands, North Carolina. On his paternal side, he was of German-Huguenot descent. His father, John Alfred Alvirett, was a large planter and sheriff of Onslow County, North Carolina. He grew up on the Avirett-Stephens Plantation.
Avirett attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1850 to 1852. He was ordained as an Episcopal priest by Bishop William Meade in 1861.
Career
Avirett was a priest of the Episcopal Church. During the American Civil War of 1861–1865, he served as a chaplain in the Confederate States Army in Alabama, under General Turner Ashby. He was the first chaplain to be commissioned to serve in the CSA in 1861.
Avirett served as the president of the Dunbar Institute, an Episcopal female seminary in Winchester, Virginia from 1865 to 1871. For the next twenty-five years, he was a priest in Sligo, North Carolina, Upper Marlboro and Silver Spring, Maryland, followed by Waterville, New York. He served as the rector of St Paul's Church Louisburg, North Carolina from 1894 to 1899.
Avirett was the author of several books. As early as 1867, he wrote a memoir of General Turner Ashby, after he had given a speech about Ashby at the University of Virginia. By 1897, he wrote two religious pamphlets.
Avirett published The Old Plantation: How We Lived in Great House and Cabin before the War in 1901. He had been encouraged to write about plantation life by Senator Zebulon Baird Vance. Prefaced by Hunter McGuire, it was presented as a response to Uncle Tom's Cabin. For David Anderson, a senior lecturer in cultural and political studies at Swansea University, the book was emblematic of nostalgic memoirs about the Old South, which was lost forever except in writing and memories. However, David Goldfield, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, suggests that it was "much less a re-creation of plantation life than a fantasy, part of the full-blown rehabilitation of the Old South that had been underway since the end of Reconstruction."
Avirett was a regular contributor to the Cumberland Evening Times, a newspaper in Cumberland, Maryland.
Personal life
Avirett married Mary Louise Dunbar Williams of Winchester, Virginia, in 1862. His wife was a driving force in the establishment of the Stonewall Cemetery, a Confederate cemetery near the Mount Hebron Cemetery and Gatehouse in Winchester, Virginia. The couple had two sons, John Williams Avirett (1863–1914), who was the owner of the Cumberland Evening Times, and Philip Williams Avirett (1867–1902), a lawyer and newspaper editor.
Death
Avirett died on February 16, 1912, in Cumberland, Maryland. By the time of his death, he was the last surviving Confederate chaplain. He was buried in Winchester, Virginia.

Two human polls comprised the 1972 NCAA University Division football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.

Argyrohyrax is an extinct genus of interatheriid notoungulate that lived during the Late Oligocene, of what is now Argentina and Bolivia.
Description
This animal may have vaguely resembled a medium-sized ground-dwelling rodent, such as a marmot. Its skull was approximately 15 centimeters long, and its entire body may have reached one meter in length, including the tail. Argyrohyrax is differentiated from its closest relatives like Archaeophylus and Cochilius by small differences in its dentition, notably the overlap of the first premolar base by parts of the canine and the second premolar. Its maxilla had a very prominent descending process, as in Cochilius. The two first lower molars had a quadrangular trigonid and a subcircular talonid. The first lower premolar was canine-like.
Compared to some of its later relatives, Interatherium and Protypotherium, Argyrohyrax had a moderately expanded zygomatic arch ; its radius had a slightly concave distal articular surface, and the articulation between its ulna and its humerus was less concave and more vertical.
Classification
Argyrohyrax proavus was first described in 1897 by Florentino Ameghino ; he later described several other species, such as Argyrohyrax acuticostatus, A. concentricus, A. nesodontoides, A. proavunculus, currently considered identical to the type species. The genus Plagiarthrus is similarly considered synonymous with Argyrohyrax.
The genus Argyrohyrax is known from several fossilized remains discovered in Argentina, notably from the Sarmiento Formation in the provinces of Santa Cruz and Chubut, from the Agua de la Piedra Formation in the Mendoza Province and from the Fray Bentos Formation in the Corrientes Province.
Argyrohyrax belonged to the family Interatheriidae, a group of medium-sized notoungulates, with a superficially rodent-like appearance. Several characteristics of its skull and dentition suggests that Argyrohyrax was nested as a basal member of the group.

Peter Kopecký is a Slovak romanist and politician.
Previously the Slovak Ambassador to Romania and Moldova and Rector of Comenius University in Bratislava, he is now Assistant Director of the Institute of European Studies and International Relations at Comenius.
He is also leader of the Slovak pro-plebiscite movement Priama demokracia - Hnutie domova (PD-HD) and vice president of the pan-European eurosceptic network EUDemocrats. In January 2009, Kopecký announced the foundation of a new party under the name Libertas Slovensko which was supposed to be the Slovak branch of the pan-European eurosceptic alliance Libertas.eu running for the 2009 European Parliament elections. In spite of public advances the EUDemocrats announced in late March that Kopecký would instead head the electoral list of the small but established Agrarian and Countryside Party. In the election, he could capture no more than 0.45% of the votes.
Peter Kopecky holds a PhD in History and Romanic Languages and is decorated with the "National Merit Order, Large Cross Rank" of Romania.

Where metaphysics tries to explain what is the universe and what it is like, feminist metaphysics questions how metaphysical answers have supported sexism. Feminist metaphysics overlaps with fields such as the philosophy of mind and philosophy of self. Feminist metaphysicians such as Sally Haslanger, Ásta, and Judith Butler have sought to explain the nature of gender in the interest of advancing feminist goals. Philosophers such as Robin Dembroff and Talia Mae Bettcher have sought to explain the genders of transgender and non-binary people.
Social construction
Simone de Beauvoir was the first feminist theorist to distinguish sex from gender, as is suggested by her famous line, “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.” In her seminal work The Second Sex, de Beauvoir argues that, although biological features distinguish men and women, these features neither cause nor justify the social conditions which disadvantage women. Since de Beauvoir, many feminists have argued that constructed categories re-enforce social hierarchies because they appear to be natural. Later theorists such as Judith Butler would challenge de Beauvoir's commitment to the pre-social existence of sex, arguing that sex is socially constructed as well as gender. Feminist metaphysics has thus challenged the apparent naturalness of both sex and gender.
Another aim of feminist metaphysics has been to provide a basis for feminist activism by explaining what unites women as a group. These accounts have historically centered on cisgender women, but more recent accounts have sought to include transgender women as well. Robin Dembroff has introduced a metaphysical account of non-binary genders.

Adib al-Shishakli (1909 – 27 September 1964 ) was a Syrian military leader and President of Syria from 1953 to 1954.
Early life
Adib Shishakli was born (1909) in the Hama Sanjak of Ottoman Syria to a Syrian family. His mother was of Kurdish origin. His family name, Shishakli, is a common surname derived from Turkish word "çiçek" which means flower and çiçekli (Shishakli) means someone or some place with flowers in Turkish.
Political/military career
Shishakli was commissioned during the French Mandate as an officer in the Syrian military in 1930. He studied at the Military Academy of Damascus (which later was relocated to Homs) and became an early member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), founded by Antun Saadeh, promoting the concept of a Greater Syria. His brother Salah was also a prominent member of the SSNP. Following Syria's independence from France, Shishakli fought in a volunteer Arab army, known as the Arab Liberation Army, in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
The Arab defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War was a motivating factor for the military coup led by Husni al-Za'im, which took place in 1949. Only months after al-Za'im's takeover, which shattered Syria's weak parliamentary system, Za'im was overthrown by a group of officers connected to the SSNP, including Shishakli and Zaim's old comrade, Colonel Sami al-Hinnawi, who led the new military junta.
Za'im had previously delivered the SSNP leader Antun Saadeh to the Lebanese authorities, who had him tried and executed for wanting to destroy the modern state of Lebanon. Reportedly, after Za'im was killed, Shishakli ripped off Za'im's bloodstained shirt and took it to Saadeh's widow, who was still in Syria, telling her, "We have avenged his murder!" .
Shishakli worked with Sami al-Hinnawi, the new de facto ruler of Syria who refused to assume power on his own and who, instead, restored Syria's parliamentary system. Hinnawi became chief-of-staff of the Syrian Army. A veteran nationalist, Hashem al-Atassi, who had been president in the 1930s, became prime minister, and later president of Syria. Atassi wanted to create a union with Hashemite Iraq, something which Shishakli greatly opposed, claiming that Hinnawi was the driving force behind pro-Hashemite sentiment in Syria.
Seizing power
In December 1949, Shishakli launched another coup, the third of that year, arresting Hinnawi to break Hashemite influence in Syria, but keeping Atassi at his post. He then ordered the assassination of Colonel Mohammad Nasser, the Air Force Commander, because he threatened Shishakli's popularity in the Syrian Army. All of this greatly weakened the pro-union elements in Syria but they continued to work for union with Hashemite Iraq through the Prime Minister, Nazim al-Kudsi.
Shishakli set the condition that any government had to include his right-hand-man, Fawzi Selu, as Minister for Defence, to curb Hashemite influence in the Syrian government. When Prime Minister Maarouf al-Dawalibi, a pro-Iraq politician from Aleppo, refused this demand, Shishakli responded on 28 November 1951 by arresting Dawalibi and his entire cabinet. He also had arrested all pro-Iraq politicians in Syria, including the leaders of the People's Party, Nazim al-Kudsi and Rushdi al-Kikhya. In protest, Atassi resigned from office and moved into the opposition. Pleased to get rid of this stubborn nationalist, who rejected military intervention in political affairs, Shishakli made his comrade Selu the Chief-of-Staff of the Army, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and the Head of State. But in effect, Selu was nothing but a figurehead. The real power lay in the hands of Adib al-Shishakli.

Shishakli then dissolved all political parties in a return to military rule. He banned a number of newspapers and outlawed all newspapers that were not pro-Shishakli. Among those to suffer persecution under his rule were the National Party of Damascus, the People's Party of Aleppo, the Communist Party, the Baath Party, and the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood. He banished the Baath leaders Akram al-Hawrani, Michel Aflaq, and Salah al-Bitar to Lebanon, where they then actively worked against his regime.
He was a skilled public speaker and relied greatly on radio to transmit his speeches to the Syrian population. In August 1952, he established an official government party, the Arab Liberation Movement, but it was boycotted by powerful representatives of civilian political society, such as Hashim al-Atassi. The party was progressive and accepted women within its ranks. It called for a limited degree of socialism. Some said that he viewed himself as "an Arab Caesar." In mid-1953 Shishakli staged an election to make himself President, but he was by now facing mounting dissent.
Foreign relations
As leader of Syria, Shishakli sought good relations with Western countries, but maintained Syria's uncompromising stance towards Israel. Syrian relations with the Hashemite monarchies of Jordan and Iraq were poor during his presidency, but he also mistrusted the rapid spread of Nasserism. Many believe that Nasser's Free Officer Revolution of 1952 in Egypt had been modeled after Shishakli's own coups of 1949 and 1951. Shishakli's developed strong relations with King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, his son, King Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and King Talal of Jordan.
Shishakli greatly liked King Talal who said that he had no ambitions in Syria, unlike his father King Abdullah I . Despite his pro-Western outlook and family background, Shishakli recognized the desires of Syria's Arab majority and accordingly adopted a policy of pan-Arabism. He clashed frequently with the independent-minded Druze minority on the Jabal al-Druze mountain range, accusing them of wanting to topple his regime using funds from Jordan. In 1954, he resorted to shelling Druze strongholds to put down resistance to his rule.
His relations with both Britain and the United States were mixed. Britain courted Shishakli during the early period of his rule in the hope that Syria would join plans for a British-led Middle East Defence Organization. The United States offered Shishakli considerable sums of money to settle Palestinian refugees in Syria and turn them into Syrians. Shishakli, although tempted by these offers of Western arms and money, did not take them. The Palestinian situation had soured the Syrian view of the West. Syria wanted revenge rather than to accept defeat and repair Syria's damaged relations with the West and make peace with Israel.
Downfall
Shishakli also had arrested a lot of active officers in the Syrian Army, including the young Adnan al-Malki, a prominent Baathist. The largest anti-Shishakli conference had been held in Atassi's home in Homs. Leading the anti-Shishakli movement were former President Atassi and the veteran Druze leader Sultan al-Atrash. Shishakli had responded by arresting Atassi and Atrash's sons, Adnan and Mansur (both of whom were ranking politicians in Syria).
Growing discontent eventually led to another coup, in which Shishakli was overthrown in February 1954. The plotters included members of the Syrian Communist Party, Druze officers, and Ba'ath Party members. It may have had Iraqi backing.
When the insurgency reached its peak, Shishakli backed down, refusing to drag Syria into civil war. He fled to Lebanon, but when the Druze leader Kamal Jumblat threatened to have him killed, he fled to Brazil. Prior to the union between Syria and Egypt in 1958, Shishakli toyed with the idea of returning to Syria to launch a coup d'état, using funds provided by Iraq. The coup was foiled by Syrian intelligence and Shishakli was sentenced to death in absentia.
On 27 September 1964, Shishakli was assassinated in Ceres, Brazil by Nawaf Ghazaleh, a Syrian Druze who sought revenge for his parents who had died leaving him an orphan during the bombardment of Jabal Druze.
One of his grandsons, Adib Ihsan Shishakly, is a member of the Syrian Opposition.

The rivière du Rat Musqué (in English: Muskrat River) flows successively in the municipality of Sainte-Perpétue and in the municipalities of Tourville, in the L'Islet Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Chaudière-Appalaches, in Québec, in Canada.
The Musk Rat River is a tributary of the east bank of Grande Rivière, which flows onto the east bank of the Ouelle River which in turn flows into the south shore of the St. Lawrence River at Rivière-Ouelle.
Geography
The Rivière du Rat Musqué takes its source at Lac du Rat Musqué (length: ; altitude: ) which is bypassed on the south side by the Canadian National. This source is located in the heart of Notre Dame Mountains at:
southeast of the south shore of the St. Lawrence River;
southeast of the center of the village of Saint-Onésime-d'Ixworth;
northeast of the center of the village of Tourville;
northeast of the center of the village of Sainte-Perpétue;
southwest of Lac Sainte-Anne.
From Lac du Rat Musqué, the Rat Musqué river flows entirely through a forest environment over , divided into the following segments:
north along more or less the railroad, then north-west, in the municipality of Sainte-Perpétue, to the municipal boundary of Tourville;
northwesterly in the municipality of Tourville, until its confluence.
The Rat Musqué river meets on the east bank of Grande Rivière. This confluence is located very close to the southeastern limit of the municipality of Saint-Damase-de-L'Islet and at to the southeast of the southern coast of St. Lawrence River.
Toponym
The toponym Rivière du Rat Musqué was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

The five-colored barbet (Capito quinticolor) is a species of bird in the family Capitonidae, the New World barbets. It is found in Colombia and Ecuador.
Taxonomy and systematics
The five-colored barbet is monotypic. It and the white-mantled barbet (Capito hypoleucos) were briefly thought to be a single species. DNA data have shown it instead to be sister to black-girdled barbet (C. dayi).
Description
The five-colored barbet is long and weighs . The male is mostly black above with a yellow "V" on the mantle. It has a red crown and nape and yellow wingbars. Its throat and breast are yellow brightening to gold or orange on the belly; the flanks have black spots. The female is also black above but heavily streaked with gold. Its throat, breast, and belly are colored like the male's but have black spots throughout.
Distribution and habitat
The five-colored barbet is found from central Chocó Department in western Colombia south into Ecuador's most northwesterly province, Esmeraldas. It inhabits wet primary and mature secondary forest and their edges and disturbed areas. In elevation it usually ranges from near sea level to but locally can be found up to approximately .
Behavior
Feeding
The five-colored barbet's diet is primarily fruit but it also takes insects. It forages from mid-level to the canopy in the forest interior; in the forest edges it also feeds in the understory. It sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks.
Breeding
The five-colored barbet's breeding phenology is practically unknown. Specimens in breeding condition suggest that its breeding season spans from April to July. A third adult has been observed accompanying apparently mated pairs.
Vocalization
The five-colored barbet's song is a "low-pitched, hollow, hoop trill" ; both sexes sing. It also has a "guttural 'churr' call" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the five-colored barbet as Near Threatened; between 2009 and 2020 it was rated as the more severe Vulnerable. "[Its] population is thought to be small and suspected to be in decline due to the loss and degradation of habitat."

Ekaltadeta ima is a species of potoroid marsupial that existed in Miocene Australia.
Taxonomy
The description of Ekaltadeta ima was assigned to a new genus Ekaltadeta as the type species in a study of fossil specimens published by Mike Archer and Tim Flannery in 1985.
The specific diagnosis of the type and genus was revised in a 1996 study by Stephen Wroe of propleonine taxa, when new fossil specimens allowed comparison with the type material and provided direct evidence of other characteristics. A largely complete skull of E. ima was described by Wroe in 1998 , prompting another reinvestigation of the propleonine clade which the author had suggested contained paraphyletic and polyphyletic species.
The name Ekaltadeta is derived from two words in an indigenous language associated with the McDonnell Ranges, combining the words for powerful, ekalta, and eta to describe the "powerful tooth". The specific epithet ima means "condemned to die" in the language of the same people.
Description
A species known by fossil taxa uncovered at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area. The remnant and recently extinct potoroids were dispersed throughout Australia, represented by herbivorous species of Potorous. Ekaltadeta ima was a larger carnivore of Miocene Australia, although smaller than its sister species Ekaltadeta jamiemulvaneyi.
The skull and dentition exhibits features associated with carnivory, and seems to consume the flesh of other animals, but evidence of the species being solely carnivorous is inconclusive and it is likely to have been omnivorous. Some of the teeth and development of the skull exhibit characters associate with a carnivore, projecting above the teeth row to allow a vertical shearing action used by larger mammalian predators.

Guyatone (Japanese: or ) is a Japanese manufacturing company which makes electric guitars, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals.
History
Guyatone was founded in 1933. According to Mr. Hiroyuki Noguchi, editor of Japan's Guitar Magazine, Matsuki Seisakujo () was founded by Mitsuo Matsuki and his friend Atsuo Kaneko, who later became a famous player of Hawaiian and Spanish style guitars. Kaneko co-founded Teisco in 1946.
Hawaiian music was becoming increasingly popular at the time, leading Kaneko to inquire to his friend Matsuki about building an electric Hawaiian guitar using his wood working and electronics skills. Matsuki had been enrolled in electronics classes. In the late 1930s the Matsuki Seisakujo was founded, producing and selling mostly Rickenbacker style guitars under the Guya name.
In 1940, Matsuki was drafted into the war between China and Japan and production halted for several years. After returning home, Matsuki formed his own company, "Matsuki Denki Onkyo Kenkyujo" (, English: Matsuki Electric Sound Laboratory).
In 1951 Matsuki began to use the Guyatone name on his instruments. The company began to make amplifiers and cartridges for record players. These cartridges found a large market after being routinely used by NHK, a government-owned broadcasting station. In 1952 or 1956 (sources disagree), the name of the corporation was changed to Tokyo Sound Company (). It was changed to Guya Co., Ltd. ( and then back to Tokyo Sound Co. once again.
According to correspondence with Toshihiko Torri, head of R&D at Guyatone, the Tokyo Sound factory began large-scale production in 1956. Guyatone's own records indicate them as being founded on July 16, 1956. By the late 1950s or early 1960s, they made up to 1,500-slide guitars, 1,600 electric guitars and basses, 2,000 guitar amplifiers, and 5,000 microphones a month.
During the late-1950s to 1960s, Guyatone guitars were distributed under various brands by other manufacturers/distributors:
In Japan, Hoshino Gakki had exported Guyatone under the Star and Ibanez brands, before Tama factory was opened in 1962. Their model 1830 (created , LG-70) or model 1860 "Rhythm Maker" (created 1960) is said to be a model for which Jimi Hendrix had traded in his Danelectro, in 1962. Then, this model was roughly copied by Kawai as model "S-180" (1964), and some models were also manufactured by FujiGen. Kawai's copied model was played by Hound Dog Taylor, as seen on his first album Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers in 1971. Ibanez reissued the Rhythm Maker as Jet King 2 (2004–2007).
In the United Kingdom, James T. Coppock (Leeds) Ltd. had introduced Guyatone under Antoria in the late 1950s, and these guitars were played by Hank Marvin, Marty Wilde, Rory Gallagher, Johny Guitar, and Ringo Starr from the Hurricanes, and even possibly young Jeff Beck. Also the Conn-Selmer UK had introduced the Guyatone under their low budget brands, Freshman and Futurama, in the late 1950s.
In the United States, Buegeleisen and Jacobson (B&J) in New York City had introduced Guyatone under Kent, along with re-badged brands such as Saturn, Marathon, Starlight, Royalist, and others. Kent guitars, established in 1960, were initially manufactured by Hagström, then also manufactured by Guyatone, Kawai, FujiGen, Teisco, and Matsumoku.
In 2013 "Tokyo Sound Co. Ltd." was closed down and transferred ownership of the "Guyatone" name to Hiroshi Matsuki (), son of the founder of Tokyo Sound Co., and brother to the president of the company, re-opening and re-organizing a short time later that same year. Guyatone now continues operations in its US office in Oswego, IL, USA with partner company DeMont MFG LLC. Later, DeMont MFG LLC was purchased and absorbed into "DeMont Guitars" along with all assets.
The Guyatone company is now owned by former R&D Guyatone engineer, Toshihiko Torii (DeMont Japan), and Nate DeMont (DeMont Guitars / Guyatone).
The DeMont / Guyatone Manufacturing facility sustained a fire in December 2017.
In Japan, Guyatone began development of a patented injection-molded guitar pick which uses small differences in contours and thickness, as well as material types, to change the feel of the pick instead of the traditional thickness of the plastic.
In late 2018, Guyatone launched their website.

The Treaty of Kėdainiai or Kiejdany, signed on 17 August 1655, was a Swedish–Lithuanian agreement during the Second Northern War. After the Polish forces had been decisively defeated in the Battle of Ujście in which the Poznań and Kalisz palatines surrendered to Sweden, Lithuanian hetman Janusz Radziwiłł decided to discontinue the war. In Kėdainiai, he accepted Swedish protection.
The treaty specified also that the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was not dissolved and that Lithuanian forces would not fight Polish forces, but the text of the treaty included protests of the lack of Polish support. On 20 October, the treaty was superseded by the Union of Kėdainiai, which united the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the Swedish Empire.

Floating Bridge () is a pontoon bridge (floating bridge) located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The bridge was built between the Al Garhoud and Al Maktoum Bridges, mainly to reduce traffic on the Al Maktoum Bridge. The bridge connects across the intersection near Deira City Centre and Dubai Creek Golf & Yacht Club, and ends at the intersection to the Riyadh Street, between Dubai Courts and the Creek Park. The bridge opened on 16 July 2007. The project cost 155 million د.إ or $US 42 million to build and has the capacity for 6,000 vehicles an hour. The bridge also serves as an alternative route for Al Maktoum Bridge where Salik was recently implemented. The Floating Bridge is the fifth crossing on the Dubai Creek, the others being Al Shindagha Tunnel, Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge and Business Bay Crossing.
Construction
The Floating Bridge was ordered by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and subsequently completed by the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority.
Waagner biro Gulf, a subsidiary of Waagner-Biro Stahibau AG was given the contract to construct the floating bridge. The bridge is 22 metres wide 365 metres long. The pontoon bridge, located alongside the Floating Bridge, features six lanes on two identical, mirrored decks, spanning the entirety of the Dubai Creek. Independent support structures have been constructed to allow the bridge to hold up to 6000 cars each hour.
The parallel structures were designed to accommodate three lanes and one pedestrian footwalk each. Between the two floating pontoons made of concrete, each 115 metres long and 22 metres wide, a hydraulically driven rotating middle section made of steel is positioned to allow for undisturbed navigation. To compensate for differences in level as well as for transverse inclinations (heeling) and longitudinal displacements resulting from traffic loads and wave action acting on the ramp, another two rows of 28 transitory elements are installed between the floating pontoons and the transitory ramp on either bank.
The structure was formed dynamically distributed energy from waves and pressure from vehicles across the length and breadth of the platform in such a way that they canceled each other out. 23 standard elements filled with highly resistant polystyrene plates serve as the actual floating body supporting several thousands of tons of the heavy bridge on water level. The bridge was assembled in day and night shifts in the record time of only 23 days. Altogether the time for design, foundation works,bank installations, as well as manufacture and installation of the steel structures added up to merely 10 months. The construction of floating bridge was completed with the cost of 155 million dirhams (US$42 million) and on 15 July 2007 an inauguration ceremony was held to officially open the floating bridge.
Operation
The bridge, which is part of the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority's strategy to ease traffic congestion in the emirate, is designed to accommodate an estimated 3,000 vehicles in each direction during peak morning and evening hours and hence reduce congestion on Al Maktoum Bridge by around 37%.
The bridge has a fixed operation timing wherein it closes at night to open the partition of the bridge to allow boats and abras to pass through.

Transtracheal jet ventilation refers to a type of high-frequency ventilation, low tidal volume ventilation provided via a laryngeal catheter by specialized ventilators that are usually only available in the operating room or intensive care unit. This procedure is occasionally employed in the operating room when a difficult airway is anticipated, such as Treacher Collins syndrome, Robin sequence, head and neck surgery with supraglottic or glottic obstruction. It is NOT recommended in emergencies if a person cannot be intubated or ventilated by other means.

"Feel Good Drag" (originally released as "The Feel Good Drag") is a song by American alternative rock band Anberlin. The song originally appeared on the band's second album Never Take Friendship Personal and was re-recorded for their fourth album, New Surrender. "Feel Good Drag" became the first single from New Surrender, which was the band's first album on major label Universal Republic. It was intended for release to American radio stations on August 18, 2008, however after a week-long delay it was released on August 26, 2008.
The single spent 29 weeks climbing the Alternative Songs chart before reaching number one. It was the longest rise to the top since the chart's 1988 inception, breaking the previous record set in February 2006 by 10 Years, with their 27-week journey for the song "Wasteland". The record was later overtaken by Phoenix's "1901", which reached number one in early 2010 after 31 weeks. That record was later eclipsed by the song "Animal" by Neon Trees.
The song is in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. The song was certified gold (500,000 copies sold) on January 22, 2014.
Recording
The song was originally released as "The Feel Good Drag" on Anberlin's second album Never Take Friendship Personal, in 2005. It was re-recorded for New Surrender in early to mid-2008. The recording of "Feel Good Drag" took place at multiple recording studios in Hollywood, California. The song was produced, along with the album, by Neal Avron. The first recording for the album took place at Swing House Recordings in West Hollywood, followed by NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood. They completed recording at The Boat Studio in Silver Lake.
Band justification
After the band announced the song as their choice for the first single, some fans began to question the choice online, intoning that perhaps their record label had pushed them to re-record the song due to lack of faith in their new material. In response, singer Stephen Christian wrote a missive for Jason Tate of AbsolutePunk.net to post. "We chose to re-record 'Feel Good Drag'," said Christian. "The label had nothing to do with it AT ALL," Christian went on to say. Christian went on to describe how the band wanted to begin their radio push with a heavy song that could catch on with a wide audience: "We didn't want to start out with something like an 'Unwinding Cable Car' or 'Inevitable'".
On top of expressing the band's own liking of the song (and feeling that it didn't get the attention it deserved on Never Take Friendship Personal), Christian said that the song was also redone because "we were counting on them [the fans] recognizing the song on the radio, feeling somehow connected to it and us, and calling in to request it more... we need you again! after all 'the feel good drag' was your song! you knew about it first, you have the original version and 'like it better', you knew us when..., this doesn't have to change."
Music video
Anberlin announced in August 2008 that they would be shooting a music video for "Feel Good Drag". In September it was announced that the video would be produced by Endeavor Media. The video was produced by Brandon Bonfiglio (Fall Out Boy, Paramore) and directed by Steven Hoover. It premiered on Yahoo Music on October 29, 2008.
The video shows the story of a female character entering a bath full of black water. It includes cut scenes of the band playing in a bathroom. Throughout the video, a man (possibly one of the members of the band) is shown banging on the door to the bathroom, trying to force himself in, while the woman begins to submerge herself into the water. At the end of the video, the man successfully breaks in, but is too late to save the woman, who has now disappeared into the shower drain, and all that is left of her is her dress. Commenting on the female character in the video, drummer Nathan Young said "it's kind of a mysterious thing, she's not really human, and then so it kind of shows that as it goes along, she kind of disappears with the black water when she unplugs it". The music video's concept reportedly took a month and a half to come up with.

The Marianne et l'Europe series or Marianne of Beaujard series was a definitive postage stamp series, issued on 1 July 2008 in Metropolitan France and the four overseas departments. The design created and engraved by Yves Beaujard marked the beginning of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union by France.
The Marianne et l'Europe series replaced the Marianne des Français series issued on 10 January 2005.
It was the first France's definitive stamp series to have all its denominations issued as self-adhesive in September 2008.
Description
Marianne, the allegory of the French Republic, wearing a Phrygian cap, is presented in profile, looking to the left. Stars surrounded her head, evoking the flag of Europe. One of these stars is in the usual place of the tricolor cockade.
Genesis
In October 2007, the President of the Republic Nicolas Sarkozy asked La Poste to organize a competition at the end of whom he would choose the new definitive stamp design of France. The competition topic was "The Marianne and Europe" (La Marianne et l'Europe). Fifty-eight artists who recently designed stamps for the French postal service were invited to send their project between 26 October and 16 November 2007. Forty-one were received and brought to the President.
Nicolas Sarkozy chose the project of engraver Yves Beaujard. La Poste's president, Jean-Paul Bailly officially presented the stamp design in Paris, on 29 January 2008.
The artist told he created "an old-fashioned Marianne", "realised a very classical version of the Marianne" and to have "given movement with the haircut" and activity with different size stars put around her head. A professional engraver, he drew with the idea to convert his design into an engraving because the definitive stamps of France has been usually printed in intaglio the past decades. It was the first time since the Liberté de Gandon d'après Delacroix series that a definitive series was designed and engraved by the same artist.
Career
After a first day sale at the Paris Salon du timbre stamp show in June 2008, the first thirteen values were nationwide issued in gummed version and self-adhesive for the three main rates, on 1 July 2008, the first day of the six month Presidency of the Council of the European Union by France. Two twelve self-adhesive stamp booklets (with six Marianne stamps and two times tree designed by Beaujard on the "values of Europe": Democracy, Environment and Peace.
During the same stamp show, a five euro silver Marianne et l'Europe stamp was issued, with postal validity.
In September 2008, alongside a new offer targeting firm and companies, La Poste issued all Marianne et l'Europe denominations in form of self-adhesive stamps, sold in indivisible sheet of one hundred stamps or coil of three hundred.

The Spain national rugby union team (Spanish: Selección de rugby de España), nicknamed Los Leones (The Lions), represents Spain in men's international rugby union competitions. The team is administered by the Spanish Rugby Federation. The team annually takes part in the European Nations Cup, the highest European rugby championship outside the Six Nations. The national side is ranked 15th in the world (as of 4 August 2022).
Rugby union in Spain dates back to 1901, although Spain did not play its first international until 1929, beating Italy 9–0 in Barcelona. Throughout the century, Spain mostly played against other European opponents such as France, Italy, Romania, West Germany, the Soviet Union, and Portugal. The team's greatest moment of success came in 1999, when Spain qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Despite being whitewashed, the team performed admirably in a group which included South Africa and Scotland.
Today, Spain competes in the European Nations Cup against Georgia, Germany, Portugal, Romania, and Russia. Spain has never been crowned European champions, though has come close. The closest they've come to becoming European champions was in 2012, having beaten both Romania and Georgia and finishing second. Many players have moved abroad to play professionally in France, in hopes of qualifying for the 2019 or possibly expanded 2023 editions of the World Cup.
History
Early history and amateur era
The exact starting point of rugby union in Spain is unknown; Catalan student Baldiri Aleu introduced the game from France to a mainstream Spanish audience in 1921, but the game might have been played on Spanish soil earlier. Through the 1920s, the game gradually gained popularity through universities in the country. The first Copa del Rey de Rugby was organized in 1926, and won by Barcelona. An unofficial Spanish XV played France, including Yves du Manoir, in 1927, but it was organised by a rebel governing body.
Spain played their first officially recognised match in 1929, winning 9–0 over Italy in the Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc. During the 1930s the Spanish rugby team played sporadically in the 1930s, playing against the national teams of Italy, Morocco, Germany, and Portugal. Due to the outbreak of World War II, rugby in much of Europe was suspended, and this included Spain. Rugby operations throughout Europe were continued in the 1950s; through this decade the Spanish struggled to the likes of West Germany, Italy and Romania. This pattern of consistency continued somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s; Spain traditionally struggled versus more established opponents such as Romania and Italy, but beat other neighboring sides such as Portugal and Morocco. However, while no official games were played between Spain and the Home Nations or the SANZAR, some Spanish sides traveled to play against various foreign sides.
The 1980s proved to be somewhat of a golden age for Spanish rugby; for the first time Spain played against non-FIRA competition, playing a test against both the Māori All Blacks and South American giants Argentina in November 1982, in Madrid. The Spanish were thrashed 66–3 to the Māori, but came close to upsetting Argentina, losing only 28 to 19. The Spanish also received Zimbabwe through various tests in the 80s. The Spanish recorded upsets, defeating Zimbabwe in Harare in 1984, winning 30–18.
World Cup begins (1987–2009)
Even more impressive, the Spanish swept a two-game tour in Zimbabwe, a team that had appeared in the 1987 Rugby World Cup, winning 28–16 and 14–9 in Bulawayo and Harare. Other notable results in this period included beating Uruguay 18–6, as well as giving scares to the sides of England and Scotland, and coming within 10 points of beating the Māori in 1988. By the end of the 80s, Spain was considered one of the best non-5 Nations teams in Europe, just barely behind Romania, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Spain officially joined the IRB in 1987, after not being invited for the 1987 Rugby World Cup, despite the USSR declining an invitation.
The 1990s provided a mixed fortune of both near misses and eventual success. In the 1991 qualifying rounds, Spain easily toppled its first group consisting of the Netherlands, Poland and Belgium, all games being played at home. However, Spain very narrowly missed on qualifying for the Rugby World Cup, losing 19–6 against Romania, finishing third behind Italy and Romania. In 1992, Spain finally beat Romania for the first time in 1992, winning 6–0. Spain again nearly beat Argentina that same year, only losing 43–34 in a shootout in Madrid.
1995 began in similar fashion to the 1991 campaign, easily toppling the first group. However, Spain were unfortunately placed in a group with Wales, losing the key fixture 54–0, and again coming close, yet not close enough.
Spain began their quest for 1999 Rugby World Cup qualification in Pool 3 of Round B of the European qualification. They won all four of their games in the round, finishing first in the group above Portugal. They, along with Portugal advanced to the next pool round with Scotland. They finished second and qualified for their first Rugby World Cup.
For the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Spain were in Pool A, along with Scotland, South Africa and Uruguay. Their first ever World Cup game was played against Uruguay, with Spain losing 27–15. They lost their subsequent pool games to Scotland and the Springboks by 40 points, both of which were played at Murrayfield. They failed to score a try in the tournament, the only team in the World to have qualified but not scored a try in the World cup.
Spain began 2003 Rugby World Cup qualifying games in May 2002. Spain advanced to Round 3 after defeating Portugal. However, they lost to both Italy and Romania, and moved through to face Russia for a place in the repechage competition. Despite losing the first game in Madrid 3–36, and looking dead in the water, Spain pulled off a very unlikely victory, winning 38–22. Despite losing on aggregate, Spain went through the repechage due to Russia being disqualified for fielding ineligible players. They defeated Tunisia and moved on to face the United States. Spain lost 62–13 and 58–13, again missing out on the World Cup.
For the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Spain finished at the top of Pool A or Round 2 of the European qualification and advanced to Round 3 where they went into Pool A. Here they won all four fixtures to finish at the top and advance to the play-off. There they faced Germany, and although they lost the first game, they won the second and went through on a 42–28 aggregate and went into Round 4 where they defeated the Czech Republic to enter Round 5. However they lost out to Romania and Georgia in Pool B, ending their hopes of reaching the World Cup in France.
2010–present
Spain missed the qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, this time struggling through their fixtures. They lost 8 of their 10 fixtures, beating only Germany those two times, and missed out on advancing to the next round of qualifying.
Spain entered the top 20 in the IRB ranking in February 2013 for the first time following a 25–18 win over the higher ranked Georgia making headlines with semi-pro back Jack Rowland making a surprising call up, due to both fly-half and first team inside center pulling out with injury moments before the squad was announces. Rowland a last moment replacement scoring 12 out of the 25 points on his international debut. Surprising ranked Georgia first time in 29 years with a victory. Spain remained in the top 20 throughout the year, ending 2013 ranked 19th. Despite this, the 2015 campaign was similarly disastrous, winning only two of their games as well as two draws. This led to a restructured of the makeup and strategies of the FER. Spain has recently participated in the World Rugby Nations Cup and the 2014 IRB Tbilisi Cup.
The 2019 qualifying saw the team markedly improve; in 2017 they beat Germany, Russia and Belgium, and lost narrowly to Romania at home. The Spaniards started 2018 with great fortune, as they defeated Russia on their home soil for the first time since 2002, and defeated Romania for the first time since 2012. With both of these victories, Spain led their qualifying group and looked set for a possible qualification at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, but a controversial defeat at Belgium in the last round, and a heavy deduction of points because of fielding of illegible players, ended their hopes.
Strip
Historically, Spain's kit reflected the colours of Spain; a red jersey with blue shorts deriving from the House of Bourbon. The current home kit consists of a red shirt with a triangular pattern and black on the waist sides, dark blue shorts and dark blue socks, while the away kit consists of a dark blue jersey, red waist sides, dark blue shorts and dark blue socks; previously, during the 1980s and 1990s, the Spanish team wore a yellow top as away kit.
In 2013, it was announced that O'Neills, one of Ireland's most notable sporting brands, would be providing the new kits for Spain. This partnership is expected to last for the rest of the decade. The team has been previously sponsored by Iberia, Orange and Renfe, and previous kit providers include Canterbury, Westport, Viator, Carisbrook New Zealand and Puma.
Currently, the kits are provided by Joma since 2016. Since 2017, Generali is the current sponsor.

Florence Van Leer Earle Nicholson Coates (July 1, 1850 – April 6, 1927) was an American poet, whose prolific output was published in many literary magazines, some of it set to music. She was mentored by the English poet Matthew Arnold, with whom she maintained a lifelong friendship. She was famous for her many nature-poems, inspired by the flora and fauna of the Adirondacks, where she lived. She was elected poet laureate of Pennsylvania by the state Federation of Women's Clubs in 1915.
Biography
Coates was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the eldest daughter of Philadelphia lawyer George Hussey Earle Sr. and Mrs. Frances ("Fanny") Van Leer Earle. She was the granddaughter of noted abolitionist and philanthropist Thomas Earle and a member of the influential Van Leer family. She gained fame both at home and abroad for her works of poetry—nearly three hundred of which were published in literary magazines such as the Atlantic Monthly, Scribner's Magazine, The Literary Digest, Lippincott's, The Century Magazine, and Harper's. Many of her poems were set to music by notable composers such as Amy Beach. She attended school in New England under the instruction of abolitionist and teacher Theodore Dwight Weld, and would further her education abroad at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Paris (Rue de Varenne), and by studying music in Brussels under noted instructors of the day.
[[Image:Liriodendron tulipifera - Hamburg (2).jpg|thumb|247px|right|Tulip-tree<poem>"My remembrance of our last visit and of your tulip-trees and maples I shall never lose ..." —Matthew Arnold, in a letter to Coates</poem>]]
Literary and social critic Matthew Arnold both encouraged and inspired Coates's writing of poetry. He was a guest at the Coates' Germantown home when his lecture tours brought him to Philadelphia. Coates and Arnold first met in New York—during Arnold's first visit and lecture tour of America—at the home of Andrew Carnegie, "where they formed a lasting friendship". The tour (which lasted from October 1883 to March 1884) brought Arnold to Philadelphia in December 1883, where he lectured at Association Hall on the topics of the "Doctrine of the Remnant" and on "Emerson". His second visit and tour of America took place in 1886, and brought him to Philadelphia in early June where he was again hosted by the Coates and spoke on the topic of "Foreign Education" at the University of Pennsylvania chapel. Arnold wrote to Coates in 1887 and 1888 from his home at Pains Hill Cottage in Cobham, Surrey, England describing his remembrance of and fondness for her "tulip-trees and maples" at her Germantown home, "Willing Terrace". Rarely did Coates write or publish prose work, but in April 1894 and again in December 1909, she contributed personal reminiscences of her mentor to The Century and Lippincott's magazines respectively.
Between 1887 and 1912, Coates published over two dozen poems within The Century Magazine. Her correspondence between Century editor Richard Watson Gilder and others is documented at the New York Public Library Digital Collections website. In one letter dated March 12, 1905, Coates submitted to Mr. Gilder a poem she wrote after being inspired by a photograph of Helen Keller holding a rose which was published in The Century the previous January. Coates requested that, if published, the poem also be accompanied by a copy of the photograph, and shared that Ms. Keller sent word that she "accord[ed] [Coates] any permission" to use the photo for that purpose. The poem, "Helen Keller with a Rose", was published in the July 1905 issue—without the accompanying photograph, but with reference to the issue in which it first appeared.
The Coates often spent their summer months in the Adirondacks, where they maintained "Camp Elsinore"—their summer camp by the Upper St. Regis Lake. It was there that they entertained, rested and escaped the humidity of Philadelphia summers, welcoming friends such as Otis Skinner, Violet Oakley, Henry Mills Alden, and Agnes Repplier. In the early 1900s, the Coates seasonally opened their camp to Anna Roosevelt Cowles ("Bamie")—the elder sister of Theodore Roosevelt. Among Cowles's visitors during her stays at Elsinore was Alice Roosevelt, President Theodore Roosevelt's daughter. Many of Coates's nature poems were inspired by the flora and fauna of the Adirondacks. Of her "spot in the mountains", Coates sings:
There's a cabin in the mountains, where the fare, dear,
Is frugal as the cheer of Arden blest;
But contentment sweet and fellowship are there, dear,
And Love, that makes the feast he honors—best!
In the March 1913 issue of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, noted anthologist and poet, William Stanley Braithwaite (1878–1962), gives a detailed nine-page review of Coates's poetry, relating how "she draws from the Olympian world figures that typify some motive or desire in human conduct, and in the modern world the praise of men and women, heroic in attainment or sacrifice; or laments events that effect social and ethical progress, showing how beneficently she has brought her art, without modifying in the least its abstract function as a creator of beauty and pleasure, into the service of profound and vital problems". Much of Coates's later published work was written during the years spanning World War I and showcased her concern for such "profound and vital problems" as her voice joined the chorus of "singers" in support of American involvement in the war—evidenced in her privately published pamphlet of war poetry, Pro Patria (1917). Coates also penned several other works of fugitive (i.e. uncollected) verse, much of which is patriotic and war-related, describing the selfless sacrifices made by soldiers and citizens alike for the cause of freedom and liberty.
Coates was a founder of the Contemporary Club of Philadelphia in 1886; one of twenty founders of the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1896—herself being a ninth generation descendant of Pilgrim John Howland; and twice president of the Browning Society of Philadelphia from 1895 to 1903, and again from 1907 to 1908. In 1915, Coates was unanimously elected poet laureate of Pennsylvania by the state's Federation of Women's Clubs.
Coates married William Nicholson in 1872. He died in 1877. On January 7, 1879, she married Edward Hornor Coates at Christ Church in Philadelphia. Edward Coates would eventually adopt Florence's daughter from her first marriage—Alice Earle Nicholson (born October 21, 1873). Florence and Edward had one child together in 1881, but the baby—Josephine Wisner Coates—died in infancy on March 5, 1881. Edward Coates was president of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1890 to 1906. He died on December 23, 1921. In 1923, Florence Coates presented The Edward H. Coates Memorial Collection'' to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. The exhibition, representing French and American schools, included 27 paintings and 3 pieces of sculpture, and was displayed from November 4, 1923, to January 10, 1924.
Coates died at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia on April 6, 1927. She is buried at the Church of the Redeemer churchyard in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania alongside her husband and her brother George Howard Earle, Jr. and many of his descendants, including his son, former Pennsylvania Governor, George Howard Earle III—Florence's nephew.

The household robot Modulus, described by the manufacturer as "the friend of Homo sapiens", was made by Sirius, a company Massimo Giuliana set up in 1982 for marketing home and personal computers, and which decided to start building its own domestic robot back in 1984. When the first "Modulus" prototype had been realized, the company asked Isao Hosoe, a Japanese designer who has been living and working in Milan for many years, to study its "body-work". Hosoe's work, however, went well beyond this, and was followed by a complete technological reprocessing of the robot. Data Process was responsible for the design and manufacture of the electronic and mechanical parts, while Sirius used the expertise of an American company, the RB Robot Corporation, for the software (its founder, Joseph H. Bosworth, is known by some as "the father of personal robotics").
Development
Two million dollars were invested in developing this particular piece of equipment. Research carried out in the United States showed that there would be greater development in this sector. It was also estimated that the use of "Modulus" could provide an opportunity to bring back into operation many PCs that were bought during the boom, but which are not used seldom, if ever. A good slice of the "Modulus" market could consist of the owners of these personal computers, newly aware of the possibility of connecting them to a personal robot.
"Modulus" was designed as a robot with possible domestic applications, but in reality it is open to any future development. Modularity - hence its name - is one of its principal characteristics, and it has been designed for adaptation to the widest possible range of applications. Comparing the robot with man, "Modulus" can be said to have an electronic "circulatory system" that permits the various extremities (arms, head, etc.) to communicate with the brain (CPU in a computer). The "Modulus" robots could have abilities such as a phonemes synthesizer, voice recognition, infrared communication, etc., making it suitable for performing many functions ranging from helping to teach children to assist the handicapped or invalids.
When studying the eventual appearance of "Modulus", Isao Hosoe began by looking at the robots of the past. These included "Electro", built by Westinghouse in 1939. Hosoe hit on the right appearance by studying human expressions and gestures, bearing in mind that a domestic robot needs to be appealing on account of its proximity to man. Its eyelids have to open, its pupils dilate or contract. It must be able to nod or shake its head, bend its torso, and raise, lower and rotate its arms. "Modulus", however, has no feet. Available in three configurations - "Base", "Service & Security" and "Moddy" - "Modulus" stands on a Base unit 35 cm in diameter and 15 cm high, two two-speed motors connected to rubber wheels, and two spherical stabilizers. It comes with a small infrared Instrument for connecting it to another remote control device or for interacting with the major home and personal computers.
Base
This first unit can be added to for different functions. As it stands it can be used in hobbies as a home computer, self-propelled peripheral, and can be useful for people wanting to learn to program robots. The simplest attachments which can be connected to the Base unit are a vacuum cleaner and a plotter-mechanism that uses felt pens, etc., to produce drawings of considerable precision.
Service & Security
The second "Modulus" configuration, the Service Robot, is obtained by fitting the Techno-cake home-security and service unit on to the Base. One of the components allow the robot to signal the presence of smoke, gas, water, and intruders; at the first sign of danger it informs the computer or triggers a siren or preset vocal message. An arm with ample freedom of movement and considerable gripping power can be added to the Service Robot. Using its meteo-system, the robot will fetch its owners umbrella if it is going to rain; a simple whistle will bring it toddling over to you.
Moddy
Moddy is the third and most advanced version of the robot. It is obtained by adding a torso, two arms, and a head to the other two units. The robot can carry a tray with its two arms. Its head and big eyes make it into a really human character, reliable, and a companion to play with. It is not surprising then if Isao Hosoe, who designed "Modulus" together with Ann Marinelli, Donato Greco, and Alessio Pozzoli, also received special advice from his two children, ten-year-old Takeo and fifteen-year-old Taro.
The first two units were previously available on the market. Base complete with vacuum cleaner and plotter-mechanism cost about a million lire, while the price of the Techno-Cake varied from two to five million lire, depending on the type and number of components in function (not all the components were available yet, on account of the time needed to develop the software). It would probably take up to a year before Moddy was ready, which would cost between eight and ten million lire, but unfortunately the "Modulus" project became too expensive, causing the bankruptcy of Sirius before Moddy could be completed. Some of the robots were later sold to companies who distributed them for the aid of handicapped while many of the Moddy robots were later sold by Arngren Electronics A/S during the early 1990s.

The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (, title I, August 10, 1988, , et seq.) is a United States federal law that granted reparations to Japanese Americans who had been wrongly interned by the United States government during World War II. The act was sponsored by California Democratic congressman and former internee Norman Mineta, Wyoming Republican senator Alan K. Simpson (who had met Mineta while visiting an internment camp) and California senator Pete Wilson. The bill was supported by the majority of Democrats in Congress, while the majority of Republicans voted against it. The act was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.
The act granted each surviving internee $20,000 in compensation, equivalent to $ in , with payments beginning in 1990. The legislation stated that government actions had been based on "race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership" as opposed to legitimate security reasons. A total of 82,219 received redress checks.
Because the law was restricted to American citizens and legal permanent residents, ethnic Japanese who had been taken from their homes in Latin America (mostly from Peru) were not granted reparations, regardless of whether they had remained in the United States, had returned to Latin America or had been deported to Japan after the war. In 1996, Carmen Mochizuki filed a class-action lawsuit and won a settlement of approximately $5,000 per eligible person. Of those affected, 145 received their settlement before funds were exhausted. In 1999, funds were approved for the Attorney General to pay compensation to the remaining claimants.
Background
Internment of Japanese Americans
The internment of Japanese Americans was the forced removal and confinement of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans (62% of whom were United States citizens) from the West Coast of the United States during World War II. Some 5,500 Japanese American men arrested by the FBI immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor were sent directly to internment camps run by the Department of Justice, and approximately 5,000 were able to "voluntarily" relocate to other parts of the country before forced evacuations began. The remainder – over 110,000 men, women and children – were sent to "relocation centers", hastily constructed camps in remote portions of the nation's interior run by the War Relocation Authority (WRA).
President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the internment with Executive Order 9066, which allowed local military commanders to designate "military areas" from which "any or all persons may be excluded." This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the entire Pacific coast region, including all of Alaska and California, and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in government custody. In 1944, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion, removal, and detention, arguing that it is permissible to curtail the civil rights of a racial group when there is a "pressing public necessity."
Redress and reparations
Some compensation for property losses was paid in 1948, but most internees were unable to fully recover their losses. In the 1960s and 1970s, a renewed movement formed within the Japanese American community to obtain redress for the wartime incarceration. The Japanese American Citizens League introduced a resolution to seek individual reparations at its 1970 conference and soon after began working with community activists and political leaders to lobby for legislative action. In 1979, the National Council for Japanese American Redress filed a class-action lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of former camp inmates, and in 1980, after a push from senator Daniel Inouye and congressmen Robert Matsui, Spark Matsunaga and Norman Mineta, Congress appointed a committee to study the effects of the incarceration and the potential for redress. The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians held investigative hearings in 11 U.S. cities, at which more than 750 people provided testimony of their experiences during and after the war. In 1983, the commission published its findings in the report Personal Justice Denied, writing that the displacement of Japanese Americans during the war had been the result of "race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership" and recommending monetary reparations be made to former internees. Although the bill to issue a formal apology and implement the CWRIC's recommendations, introduced in 1987, faced heavy resistance from President Reagan and Senate Republicans opposed to increased federal spending, it was signed into law on August 10, 1988.
On October 9, 1990, a ceremony was held to present the first reparations checks. Nine elderly Issei received $20,000 each and a formal apology signed by President George H. W. Bush. United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh presented the checks to the attendees, dropping to his knees to reach those in wheelchairs.
Payments to surviving internees or their heirs continued until 1993, overseen by the Office of Redress Administration, one of two government agencies created to carry out the 1988 act's implementation. The other, the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund, was established in order to meet the redress bill's provision to educate the public about the incarceration. $50 million was authorized "to sponsor research and public educational activities" in 1988, but anti-spending lobbying put the education program on hold until 1994 and reduced the final amount to $5 million. President Bill Clinton appointed an advisory board in 1996, and the CLPEF was used to fund various educational programs and grants from 1997 to 1998.

The Civil Liberties Act of 1988, Restitution for World War II internment of Japanese-Americans and Aleuts, states that it is intended to:
Congressional support and opposition
On September 17, 1987, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill (which symbolically shared its number with that of the 442nd Infantry Regiment) by a vote of 243 to 141, with 38 members not voting. The majority of Democrats in the House voted for the bill (180 in favor vs. 43 opposed) while a majority of Republicans voted against it (63 in favor vs. 98 opposed).
On April 20, 1988, the U.S. Senate passed the bill by a vote of 69 to 27, with 4 members not voting. A large majority of Democrats voted for the bill (44 in favor vs. 7 opposed), while a more narrow majority of Senate Republicans also voted for the bill (25 in favor vs. 20 opposed).

Sikhs have a given name and one or both of a surname and a Khalsa name. The surname may be a family name (based on the name of the ancestral village) or a caste name. Different castes still exist today in some aspects of Punjabi culture; similarly to the Hindu caste system, this system is based on employment (ex. jatt signifies the farming caste).
On becoming a Khalsa, the Sikh undertakes the obligation to wear the physical symbols of this status (the Five Ks) and takes the name "lion", usually romanized as Singh, if a man, or /kaur/ "the Crown Princess" for female, usually romanized as Kaur, if a woman. (Note that Singh is spelled irregularly: it is written /singh/ but pronounced /siṅg) These names reflect the strong egalitarianism of the Sikh religion. The adopting of the Khalsa name is symbolic for being a member of a larger family or faith. These names were originally intended to replace the Sikh's original surname, which was often a caste name.
Some Sikhs do replace their original surname with their Khalsa name, but many retain their original surname and add the Khalsa name before it. Thus, a man born Sandeep Brar should become Sandeep Singh but more likely will become Sandeep Singh Brar. Similarly, a woman born Harjeet Gill should become Harjeet Kaur or Harjeet Kaur Gill.
First Names
Sikhs use a set of several hundred given names, all or nearly all meaningful, usually with a religious or moral theme. For example, Ujjal means "bright, clean, holy". The process of choosing a Sikh's first name, known as the Naam Karan, occurs following the first few days of their birth, in a ceremony called the Hukamnama (referring to a hymn from the Guru Granth Sahib as the will from God); a family often selects a name for a child by opening the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib to a certain "aang" and choosing a name that begins with the first letter of the first word on the "aang".
Sikh given names are gender neutral, generally formed of a prefix and a suffix (ex. Har/jeet/). There is however, a gender connotation attached when pronouncing a name, say Parkāśh for example; it may be either male or female, but /parakāśō/ is female while /parakāśū/ is male.
Last Names
In Sikhism, women don't change their surnames after marriage - this is due to the fact that each partner keeps Singh and Kaur respectively, who use their preferred names). Again, Punjabi culture generally contradicts this as women are expected to take their husband's family name. Their daughters would then generally have a given name, as well as the Khalsa name and their father's last name, which is usually the name of the father's village; for example, a girl with the name Harjeet, whose father's last name is Aulakh, would then become Harjeet Kaur Aulakh (meaning "Harjeet, princess of Aulakh"). In spite that this system is not permitted for Sikhs as it reinforces both tribalism and the patriarchy, it is the most widely used naming system amongst non-initiated Sikhs (and still prevalent among initiated Sikhs). Sikh girls take on last name of Singh, a practice more common in larger cities.
Many Sikhs use the sole Singh and Kaur (without any other family name). Initiation is not necessary to use these Sikh last names. Some believers maintain that this practice of naming without using the word Singh or Kaur is manmat (Against the will of the Guru) and is prohibited in the Rehat Maryada (The way of living of Sikhs).

Stemmiulida is an order of millipedes consisting of approximately 130 species, reaching up to 50 mm in length. It contains a single family, Stemmiulidae.
Description
Stemmiulids are small to medium sized millipedes, reaching a maximum length of 50 mm (2 in). The body tapers gradually, and is laterally compressed, so is taller than wide. A dorsal groove is present and runs from head to tail. The eyes consist of two large ocelli on each side of the head, and some members are capable of jumping. The living species lack Tömösváry organs, although a fossil species from the Miocene epoch possesses them.
Classification
Stemmiluda contains 6-10 living genera and at least one fossil genus, all in the family Stemmiulidae. Species estimates range from about 120 to 150 species. The taxonomy is controversial, with some authors lumping species into as few as three genera. The most liberal classification is presented below.

Dual is an album by four acclaimed Irish and Scottish musicians: Éamonn Doorley, Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh (both prominently of Danú), Julie Fowlis and Ross Martin.
The artists released the album in October 2008 on their official websites. The album was planned to project the similarities and differences between the Irish and Scottish Gaelic song traditions. The album features Scottish waulking songs such as Alasdair Mhic Cholla Ghasda, and an Irish equivalent to the Scottish puirt à beul. The songs are set in a traditional/folk accompaniment, very different from the recorded versions of a few of the songs by Capercaillie and Clannad.
The four musicians have been playing music together since a sing-song at the Tønder Festival in 2003. The four-piece has toured together twice a year both in Ireland and Scotland. Julie and Muireann have had very similar upbringings and found their music and languages shared many common threads. Hence the name, Dual, which means "to braid, to twine, inheritance or native" in both Irish and Scottish Gaelic. The album features songs in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and tunes from both cultures.

Motiroti was a London-based organisation which used the arts to achieve intercultural innovation. Since the mid-1990s the company made internationally acclaimed and award-winning art that transformed relationships between people, communities and spaces. motiroti worked at the forefront of ever-changing global social realities, challenging and teasing perceptions of artists, institutions and audiences alike.
Working with a range of collaborators within visual and live art, new technology and socially engaged practice, motiroti made public art with the public itself being central to the making and shaping of the work, using emerging social technologies to incorporate multiple perspectives within artworks. The company fostered the development of a lifelong learning culture, with learning and art production part of the same process, and offered potent opportunities to inspire and develop a dynamic exchange between artists and communities.
History
Motiroti means 'fat bread' in Urdu, and the company took its name from one of its earliest projects, Moti Roti Puttli Chunni - a playful examination of gender stereotypes, presented as live Bollywood musical theatre in east London. Co-founded by artists Ali Zaidi and Keith Khan, motiroti was officially registered as a charity in 1996, although the pair had worked together since the late 1980s. Khan left the company in 2004 to become CEO of the Rich Mix Cultural Foundation. Ali Zaidi continued as the sole Artistic Director until 2012, when he left to establish his own freelance practice under the name of Ali Zaidi Arts. motiroti was thereafter led by Executive Director Tim Jones, who joined the company in 2010, and following its closure operates as an independent consultant and workshop designer, advising on the development of enterprise opportunities and digital capacity in the culture sector.
Details of motiroti projects, from the early 1990s onwards, can be viewed online here. A catalogued archive of its work from the late 1980s up to 2005 is owned by Future Histories, the UK's first dedicated repository for African, Asian and Caribbean performing arts, and its contents can be viewed here.

Altrossgarten Church (, also spelled Altroßgärtner) was a Protestant church in northeastern Königsberg, Germany. Johann Friedrich Schultz, an Enlightenment, Protestant, theologian, mathematician and philosopher was Deacon of the church in 1775.
History
The parishioners in the Rossgarten quarter originally belonged to Löbenicht Church. They were then allowed to build a small wooden chapel on Predigerstraße, which was dedicated in 1623 and completed the following year. The first pastor was the hymnist Georg Weissel from Domnau (1590-1635), previously pastor in Friedland. Although this church was originally known as the Rossgarten Church (Roßgärter Kirche), its name was changed to Altroßgärter Kirche (Old Rossgarten Church) to differentiate it from Neurossgarten Church built in Neurossgarten in the 1640s.
Because of the increasing population of Rossgarten, a replacement brick church was built around the chapel by the initiative for Weissel's successor, Pastor Georg Falck (1625-1720). Construction began in 1651 and its dedication occurred in 1683; the prior wooden chapel was dismantled from 1683-84. The new church's steeple with tented roof dated to 1693.
Sights of Altrossgarten Church included its high altar from 1677, Baroque baptismal chamber, and a confessional with columns by Isaak Riga the Younger from 1692. The church's organ with two caryatids was designed by Adam Gottlob Casparini. The chamber tomb on the northern side had a beautiful wrought iron door designed by the locksmith Johann Michael Sommer in 1712.
The church was restored in 1923. Pastors of the church included Kons.-Rat B. Ankermann, Paul Kuessner, W. Pensky, Lic. Erich Leidreiter, and Erich Lackner.
Altrossgarten Church was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of Königsberg and 1945 Battle of Königsberg, with its ruins demolished by the Soviet administration in Kaliningrad in 1968. A silver-gilt chalice from the church is now in the Berlin archives of the Evangelical Church in Germany.

The Kasatka class was a class of submarines built for the Imperial Russian Navy. The six boats were built between 1904 and 1905. They were designed by I. G. Bubnov and were based on the . The first boat, , experienced significant problems with stability on trials and had to have extra flotation added. In 1905, four of the class were transferred from Western Russia to Vladivostok with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War. Initially powered by a kerosene/electrical system, the boats were re-built around 1910 with a diesel-electric power plant following the end of the war. The class remained in service throughout World War I. Two were captured by the German Empire in 1918 and handed over to the British following the German surrender. They were scuttled by the British in 1919 to prevent their capture by the Soviets. The remaining four were broken up for scrap in 1922.
Design and description
I. G. Bubnov was tasked with producing a submarine design following experience with the , which had been deemed a success. The design was accepted by the Naval Technical Committee on 20 December 1903. As designed the class had a surfaced displacement of and displaced when submerged. They were long with a beam of with a draught of . The submarines were propelled by one shaft powered by a kerosene engine for travel on the surface rated at and an electric motor rated at . The Kasatka class had a maximum speed of on the surface and submerged. Initially the design called for a three-shaft propulsion system, but due to the increased hostilities with the Empire of Japan, the submarines were completed with only the one shaft-design. They had a range of at surfaced and at submerged. The class was armed with four torpedoes carried externally in Drzewiecki drop collars and one machine gun. Vessels of the class had a complement of 24.
Modifications
In 1906–1907, new conning towers were installed aboard the submarines to rectify buoyancy issues. In 1910, the Kasatka class were rebuilt with new power plants. They received a diesel-electric system which included a diesel engine rated at . The displacement of the submarines increased to surfaced and submerged. Two of the class, Nalim and Skat, were given a gun in 1915.
Ships
Service history
The first submarine of the class, Kasatka was ordered in the 1903 building programme on 2 January 1904, with the rest ordered as part of the 1904 Emergency Programme, with the next four ordered on 24 February 1904 and Feldmarshal General Sheremetev on 26 March 1904. Feldmarshal General Sheremetev was paid for by public subscription with the Sheremetev family as major donors. Due to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, construction was accelerated on the submarines and only Kasatka ran sea trials. During trials, Kasatka had trouble during operation of the ballast tanks, steering gear and water entered the submarine through the main hatch when submerged. The latter problem was rectified by the addition of two floats attached to the aft casing first on Kasatka and then on the others. Kasatka was then transferred to Vladivostok by rail, followed by the rest between September and December 1904 with the exception of Makrel and Okun. Makrel and Okun remained in the west and were used as evaluation boats for the design. Kasatka and Skat became operational in March 1905, followed by Feldmarshal General Sheremetev and Nalim in May 1905. Completion of Makrel and Okun took until 1907. At Vladivostok, the submarines were used as a deterrent against Japanese warships. They operated out to from the coast and remained as visible as possible, remaining at sea for up to five days, though some patrols lasted two weeks. Upon completion Makrel and Okun were assigned to the 1st Division of the Baltic Fleet.
During World War I, Nalim and Skat were transferred to the Black Sea in 1915 and joined the Black Sea Fleet. That same year, Feldmarshal General Sheremetev and Kasatka were transferred to the Baltic Sea and joined the Baltic Fleet. In June 1915, Okun and Makrel were among the submarines deployed off the Kurland coast. Okun engaged the German cruiser , but missed. However, the submarine threat led the German command to withdraw their ships from around Windau. In August, the two submarines were ordered to the Gulf of Riga as part of the Russian attempt to defend against the German High Seas Fleet's movements in the area. Following the arrival of British submarine reinforcements, the smaller Russian submarines were deployed on coastal defence missions in the Baltic. After the entry of the Romania into the war on the side of the Allies in 1916, Nalim and Skat were based at Batumi but remained relatively inactive. Kasatka and Feldmarshal General Sheremetev transferred to Arkhangelsk in 1915 and 1916 respectively, arriving via inland waterways. In 1917, the two submarines were sent back to the Baltic for overhaul.
In March 1917, Nalim and Skat were removed from service. In August 1917, Feldmarshal General Sheremetev was renamed Keta. In 1918, Kasatka, Makrel and Okun were transferred to the Caspian Sea. In April 1918, Nalim and Skat were re-activated and used against the Soviets. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed ending the Russian participation in World War I, they briefly flew the flag of the Ukrainian State before the Germans seized Nalim and Skat. In November 1918, following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 which ended World War I, the British took over the submarines after the German Empire surrendered. The two subs were later scuttled by the British at Sevastopol to prevent their capture by the Soviets during the Russian Civil War. The surviving boats were broken up for scrap in 1922.

"Gigi l'amoroso" is a French song by Dalida first released on a single, with the song "Il venait d'avoir 18 ans" on the side B, whose lyricists and composers are Michaële, Lana Sebastian and Paul Sebastian. It is one of the singer's biggest international hits with a million records sold worldwide. The disc will be certified gold in Canada as well as platinum in Switzerland. The record company IPG will also give her a platinum disc for sales made in the Benelux.
Charts
According to the record company, the song would have been number 1 in 9 countries, namely France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, French Switzerland, German Switzerland, and Benelux (which actually represents 7 countries).
However, the title would have been No. 1 only in Switzerland, Flanders and Quebec according to the official rankings and would never have reached the Japanese rankings. The song also occupied 2nd place in sales in the Netherlands and Spain, 4th in Wallonia, 10th in France, as well as 13th place in Germany thanks to the ranking of the single Er war gerade 18 jahr.

Titler graduated from Mount Mercy in 1974 with the Mary Catherine McAuley award as their top graduating senior.
Following her graduation, Titler accepted a faculty position teaching medical-surgical nursing at Mount Mercy University. She then returned to school to earn her Master's degree in nursing from the University of Iowa before joining the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
Career
In 1991, Titler received the Teresa E. Christy Award as a "nurse who has demonstrated professional commitment to the improvement of health care and has demonstrated the interrelationship of nursing education, nursing practice, and nursing research." A few years later, she became the Associate Director of Nursing Research and Clinical Nurse Specialist, II, Critical Care, at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. As a result of her research, Titler became a member of the National Advisory Council for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality from 2000 to 2003 and she co-published The Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care.

In 2010, she was appointed to the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines. Later that year, she was also the inaugural winner of the Friends of the National Institute of Nursing Research President's Award. She received the award for her work in "translating evidence to nursing practice and the development of translation science." By 2013, Titler was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Iowa for her achievements in science and health care.
In 2015, Titler was elected a member of the National Academy of Medicine for her research on outcomes effectiveness and implementation science. Following her election, she stepped down as UMSN's Chair of the Systems, Populations, and Leadership department, to spend more time on her scholarship and research, and was replaced by Rob Stephenson. In January 2020, Titler's co-authored book Evidence-based Practice for Nursing and Healthcare Quality placed third in the American Journal of Nursing's 2019 Book of the Year Awards in the Advanced Practice category.

The 1998 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 72nd year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Roll of honour
Summary
The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover at £78,981,066 and attendances recorded at 3,606,704.
Irish Greyhound Derby champion Toms The Best trained by Nick Savva was voted Greyhound of the Year after finishing runner-up in the Scottish Greyhound Derby at Shawfield Stadium and winning the 1998 English Greyhound Derby.
Linda Mullins won Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the third successive year.
The industry lost Wembley when it was announced that greyhound racing would no longer take place there. The last race was held on Friday 18 December. A twist of fate resulted in a no race on that final night after a hare failure, just like 71 years previous when on the opening night in 1927 the same happened.
Tracks
Independent track Long Eaton in the hands of the receivers Grant Thompson suffered a catastrophic grandstand fire on Sunday 27 December. The receivers had hoped to sell it for £1.5 million to developers but the Erewash council had voted unanimously (44-0) that the track would remain a sporting venue. However that plan was scuppered after the fire which local police treated as suspicious. With no grandstand anyone interested in bringing back racing had pulled out of negotiations. Leading owner, Pat Chambers, had been involved in a scheme to buy the track in January.
News
Wembley Racing Manager John Rowley left the sport whilst Peter Miller moved to Heave. Wembley trainers Ken Tester and Terry Atkins relocated to Catford before switching to Crayford and Oxford respectively, Patsy Cusack joined Crayford and Hazel Dickson joined Wimbledon, John Haynes kept a small kennel to open race, while Wally Ginzel and Pam Heasman would both soon retire.
The Sporting Life closed in May after a merger with the Racing Post; it was the end of an era for the newspaper that had served greyhound racing for decades and its editor Bob Betts. Subsequently the Racing Post sponsored a new festival of racing at Walthamstow.
Seven-time champion trainer John McGee Sr. returned to England after spending four years in Ireland. He leased the Halls Green Farm kennels in Roydon, Essex, where former Walthamstow stars were reared, after selling his Woodlands Kennels in County Kildare. His relationship with the NGRC remained fractious and they announced that they would not be licence him until he met the £30,000 legal bill accumulated from the failed high court ban back in 1994. After agreeing a payment he was given an attachment at Rye House. Meanwhile at Peterborough Racing Manager Mike Middle retired and was replaced by Con Baker.
Sheffield won the Supertrack (a competition between tracks); they beat the competition which included hosts Walthamstow by scoring 81 points; Walthamstow finished 2nd with 69 points with Henlow in third with 39.
Competitions
The last Grand National at Hall Green was won by a greyhound called El Tenor trained by Linda Mullins and owned by Italian film producer Mario Lanfranchi. The brindle dog had won the Essex Vase in 1996 before being disqualified and being switched to hurdles and then won 9 from 13 before the Grand National. During the final El Tenor came from off the pace to catch and beat Quote That and Mullins saw a gap in the open race circuit over stayers hurdles. No other greyhound could compete with him over staying hurdles events and he won many open races throughout the year and passed Poor Sue's record of 69 open victories when picking up another victory at Nottingham in December.
In the Pall Mall Stakes at Oxford Stadium Droopys Eric took a length off Carmels Prince's eight year old track record beating Blue Murlen in the process. Later following a major car accident Droopys Eric was injured with a kennelmate dying and passenger Olive Tasker seriously injured. Eric was withdrawn from the semi finals. On 17 March, Ernie Gaskin Sr. won his third trainer's championship when winning the event at Sittingbourne. The event was the closest in history because Gaskin and Brian Clemenson tied on points, meaning that on count back the number of winners would determine the champion. However they also had an equal number of winners, which resulted in the decision that second placings would count.
During the Golden Jacket final Bubbly Princess won but was then disqualified by the stewards, the connections were waiting at the podium when the announcement took place. Linda Jones and the Bubbly Club lost the £7,500 first prize but Mario Lanfranchi the owner of El Onda gave the trophy away after not being happy at winning by default.

Hasköy is a trading and residential district on the northern bank of the Golden Horn in Beyoğlu, Istanbul, Turkey. It includes the neighbourhoods of Keçeci Piri, Piri Paşa, and Halıcıoğlu, and parts of Camiikebir and Sütlüce. Immediately to the south lies Kasımpaşa.
Hasköy means "imperial village" in Turkish, a reference to the pavilions and gardens belonging to the Ottoman sultan and his court that once lined the shore here. Armenian speakers knew it as Khasgiugh (Խասգիւղ), "khas" reflecting the older pronunciation of the Turkish word "has" and "giugh" being the Armenian word for village.
The Golden Horn ferry has a stop at Hasköy which links the district to Üsküdar, Karaköy, Kasımpaşa, Fener, Balat, Ayvansaray, Eyüp and Sütlüce. It is also linked by minibuses to the Metro stop at Şişehane. The E5 highway runs right across the northern edge of Hasköy.
History
In the late fifteenth century, Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal took refuge in the Ottoman Empire and many of them settled in Hasköy. In the late sixteenth century, the Jewish community of Eminönü, displaced by the construction of the New Mosque (Yeni Cami), also moved to Hasköy. The neighborhood also boasted many Armenian and Greek residents in the past.
The large Jewish population meant that there were once several synagogues in Hasköy, serving the different communities. These included the Maalem Synagogue, the Hesed Le Avraam Synagogue, the Karaite Synagogue and the former Mayor Synagogue. None is currently active.The Esgher Synagogue has been turned into a cafe.
Istanbul's first Armenian theatre company was founded here in 1858.
Local Attractions
The main local attractions open to the public are the Aynalıkavak Palace, the last remant of the old Ottoman Tersane (Shipyard) Palace, and the Rahmi M. Koç Museum, Turkey's first industrial museum housing an impressive on the history of transport, partially housed in a disused 19th-century shipyard and partially in a stone-built factory that used to manufacture anchors.
The Greek Orthodox Church of Aya Paraskevi (Saint Paraskevi) currently serves the local Romanian Orthodox community.
The Surp Stepanos (Saint Stephen) Armenian Church was established by Armenian immigrants from Eğin. From 1852 to sometime in the 20th century, the Halıcıoğlu Armenian Protestant Church also offered services; while from 1889 to 1975, there was also a chapel attached to Hasköy's Kalfayan Orphanage, the Surp Asdvadzadzin (Saint Mary) Armenian Church.
Local mosques include the Handan Agha Mosque, and Kırmızı Minare Mosque.
Hasköy is home to several cemeteries including the Hasköy Muslim Cemetery, the Beyoğlu Greek Cemetery, the Turkish Karaite Congregation Cemetery, and the Hasköy Armenian Cemetery. The Hasköy Jewish Cemetery (Hasköy Musevi Mezarlığı), with gravestones in a number of different languages, contains the grave of Abraham Kamondo, a banker to the Ottoman court, who had a waterside palace in nearby Kasımpaşa. In April, 2011, the cemetery was desecrated by vandals who smashed several headstones in what appears to have been an act of anti-Semitism. Another act of destruction against dozens of Jewish graves happened in July 2022.

PowerCloud Systems was a cloud networking company located in Palo Alto, California. The company designed and manufactured cloud-powered Wi-Fi systems for businesses, carriers and consumers and was a corporate spin-off from the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), a Xerox company. PowerCloud was purchased by Comcast in July 2014.
History
PowerCloud Systems was incorporated in 2009 and was spun-out as an independent firm in 2010 with investment from Walden Venture Capital and Javelin Ventures.
On September 20, 2010, at PARC's 40th anniversary celebration, PowerCloud showcased its first product, the CloudCommand online software platform for network equipment providers. This platform enabled network equipment vendors and communications service providers to introduce Wi-Fi networking products that could be managed from the cloud. The platform has subsequently evolved and PowerCloud now offers a portfolio of cloud-managed wireless access points and a Web-based management dashboard that are both white-labeled by communications service providers and are marketed directly to businesses through managed service providers that wish to manage their clients wireless networks.
On January 25, 2011, D-Link became the first major OEM vendor to launch product based on the CloudCommand platform. Zyxel announced product at Interop in May 2011 and launched on November 11, 2011.
In December 2011, PowerCloud Systems announced it had secured $6 million in Series B funding in a round that was led by Qualcomm Ventures and included participation from its existing investors – Walden Venture Capital, Javelin Venture Partners and PARC.
In April 2013, PowerCloud Systems officially entered into the consumer Wi-Fi market with the introduction of Skydog, a combination Wi-Fi router, cloud service and HTML5-based application.
In 2013, the company began shipping a commercial solution under its own brand and announced Nickelodeon Resort as a customer in September.
In December announced partnership with Common Sense Media. The company showcased the product at CES 2014 to favorable reviews.
In July 2014 PowerCloud Systems announced on the homepage of Skydog that they had been acquired, and retail sales of Skydog router had ceased. No acquirer was named in announcement.
In July 2014, Comcast confirmed to Tech Crunch that they had acquired PowerCloud Systems, as speculated. PowerCloud's technology serves as the basis for Comcast's xFi which is now available to 23.5 million homes.
Management
Jeff Abramowitz founded PowerCloud Systems and served as the company's president and CEO. Abramowitz' is included in the Computer History Museum for his role in the formation and growth of the W-Fi industry.
Abramowitz has held executive positions in the Wi-Fi industry for more than 25 years. He was director of Wireless Product Management at 3Com where he spearheaded the company's wireless LAN efforts and its first wireless initiative, as well as serving as the company's representative on the board of the Wireless LAN Association.
At Intersil, Abramowitz launched the company's Wi-Fi efforts into the home.
At NoWires Needed, a Dutch start-up, Abramowitz was responsible for worldwide Marketing and US operations. He helped to introduce the industry's first ARM-based Medium Access Controller capable of supporting performance required for the 54Mbit/s IEEE 802.11a standard. NoWires Needed was acquired by Intersil in June 2000 for $156M.
Abramowitz was responsible for Wi-Fi marketing and business development at Broadcom. While there, he helped to introduce the first CMOS Wi-Fi chipset, first single chip Wi-Fi, and first 802.11g solution.
Abramowitz was responsible for marketing and strategy at wireless company Azimuth Systems, where he helped to introduce the first Wi-Fi automated test equipment for MIMO radios and the first platform for Wi-Fi Alliance testing
As an entrepreneur-in-residence at Xerox PARC he spun out PowerCloud Systems and served as the founder, CEO and chairman of the board.
Abramowitz is a current board member and past president of Cloud4Wi, a leading Wi-Fi services platform for marketing, location services for retail, restaurant and transportation. Abramowitz was inducted into the Wi-Fi Now Hall of Fame in 2019.
Andrea Peiro co-founded PowerCloud Systems and serves as the company's CTO and chief product officer. Peiro had been a well-known product strategist, and was a former intelligence officer in the Italian Navy.
Products
Cloud Command Enterprise
CloudCommand Enterprise is a Wi-Fi system that consists of Wi-Fi access points that can be deployed, secured and managed via a cloud-based management interface. This approach, which does not require wireless controller hardware, is ideal for deployments with a high-density of mobile users, such as hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, schools, conference centers, assisted living facilities, and Multi-Dwelling Units (MDUs) such as apartment buildings. This method of instantiating a wireless network does not require onsite wireless LAN controller hardware; as the access points are managed via the cloud network. Ostensibly this reduces equipment costs and eases management. This technology also enables businesses or Value-Added Resellers to create multiple private wireless networks using the same public access infrastructure.
Skydog
Skydog is a combination 802.11n Wi-Fi router, cloud service and HTML5-based application. Skydog gives consumer visibility into and control over the home Wi-Fi network. They can view and control any device connected to the network and prioritize resources by user, device or application. The solution was a consumer version of the company's enterprise product.
Skydog's capabilities represent a break from historical use of Wi-Fi routers, most of which were primarily used to provide wireless connectivity to a household's Internet connection and little else. Some existing high-end routers allow for remote access and the instantiation of parental controls. Skydog claimed their cloud solution integrated parental controls, a mobile experience, and more granular control over specific devices, users, and applications connecting to the home network. Consumers could then better control distribution of bandwidth and monitor activity on their network. PowerCloud Systems marketed the solution primarily to families with children using the Internet, saying that it allows parents to better understand and manage how their kids use the Web.
Skydog was originally funded via Kickstarter in Spring 2013. The project was fully funded and received $121,813 in funding from more than 1,000 backers by May 14, 2013. On September 3, 2013, PowerCloud Systems announced that it had shipped Skydog on time to its 1000 Kickstarter backers. PowerCloud Systems made Skydog available to the general public on October 30, 2013.
Skydog was positively reviewed as an Internet solution for families by media including PC Magazine and Yahoo.
On March 19, 2014, PowerCloud announced WebRover, a free update to the Skydog cloud service, that provided a list of more than 1,000 sitesrated for age-appropriate content and educational quality by Common Sense Media.

The northern yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis), formerly the African yellow white-eye, is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It is found across sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal in the west across to southern Sudan in the east and south to northern Angola.
Taxonomy
The northern yellow white-eye formerly included additional subspecies. These were split to create the southern yellow white-eye and the green white-eye based partly on the results of a molecular phylogetic study in 2013.
There are seven subspecies:
Z. s. senegalensis Bonaparte, 1850 – Mauritania and Senegal to northwest Ethiopia
Z. s. jacksoni Neumann, 1899 – west Kenya and north Tanzania
Z. s. demeryi Büttikofer, 1890 – Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast
Z. s. gerhardi Elzen & König, C, 1983 – south Sudan and northeast Uganda
Z. s. kasaicus Chapin, 1932 – central D.R. Congo to northeast Angola
Z. s. heinrichi Meise, 1958 – northwest Angola
Z. s. quanzae Meyer de Schauensee, 1932 – central Angola
Description
A small yellow bird with a prominent white eye ring surrounding a dark eye. The underparts and head are yellow, with a black loral stripe, black bill, the flight and tail feathers are brown edged with yellowish olive. Some subspecies are greener, especially those occurring in forest. Juveniles are darker. This bird measures 11·5 cm in length and the weight varies from 6.8 to 14.1g.
Distribution
The northern yellow white-eye is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal, Gambia and Mauritania in the west east to Ethiopia and Eritrea then south to northern Angola.
Habits
The northern yellow white-eye has been recorded as a host of the brood parasite green-backed honeybird.
The northern yellow white-eye has a diet that mainly consists of insects; caterpillars, aphids and termite alates have all been recorded, supplemented with some fruit including those of figs and the cabbage tree Cussonia spp. It forages among the canopy of trees, gleaning prey from foliage and bark. It is frequently recorded as a member of mixed-species foraging flocks. Also takes nectar from flowers.
The nest is a small cup made out of dried grass and small twigs, placed among the foliage in a small tree about 3.5m above the ground and secured with spider web. The clutch of 2-4 eggs is laid from August–January, with most being laid in September–October. Incubation takes about 11–12 days and both sexes share this duty and the feeding of the nestling young which fledge after around two weeks.
If disturbed in the nest the young will often panic and jump out of the nest.

Drake Maxwell Levin (August 17, 1946 – July 4, 2009) was an American musician best known as the guitarist for the pop-rock band Paul Revere & the Raiders.
Levin was born in Chicago, and his family's name, Levinshefski, was shortened to Levin a few years before his birth. Levin joined the band when he was 16 years old, which earned him the nickname "The Kid" from Paul Revere. His addition helped establish Paul Revere and the Raiders as a premier showband in the Northwest United States. Levin's performances included synchronized dance steps, playing on his knees, standing on his amplifier and playing his guitar behind his head. After a performance at Seattle's Spanish Castle Ballroom, a young man who had watched from the front of the stage all evening approached Drake. He said that Drake's playing had inspired him and said he was a really good showman. As Drake thanked him and they shook hands, Drake asked the young man his name and he replied, "Jimi Hendrix."
The Raiders became a national teen sensation from their daily television exposure on the ABC television show Where The Action Is. It was during that time that Levin and the Raiders produced many hit records. Levin's blues-based guitar style helped drive the band's raw, edgy sound. Levin's synchronized dance steps and stage antics with fellow Raider bassist Phil "Fang" Volk earned the pair the nickname "The Twins". In 1966, Levin left the performing version of the band to fulfill his military service obligation by joining the National Guard. This enabled him to continue recording in the studio with the group during his time off. Levin's guitar work and background vocals can be heard on Raiders albums through The Spirit of '67, although his name and photo do not appear on the album cover with the band. Jim "Harpo" Valley had stepped into Levin's place on the Raiders' television and concert performances, thus Valley's photo appears with the band on that particular album.
When Volk became ill and could not tour, Levin stepped in to cover for his friend on a few dates, filling in for Volk on bass. When Levin's performing replacement, Valley, decided to leave the band after a little over a year with the group, Levin again rejoined the Raiders to help them finish their spring 1967 tour. Levin was to perform with the Raiders on the Ed Sullivan Show on April 30, 1967, but band leader Paul Revere was upset at the pending departure of Volk and drummer Mike "Smitty" Smith and believed Levin to be partially responsible. Unknown to the group, Revere had hired a replacement guitarist, Freddy Weller, to perform with the group on the Sullivan show, leaving Levin to watch the Raiders only Ed Sullivan Show performance as a spectator.
Brotherhood
Volk and Smith left the band after the Sullivan performance and Levin re-teamed with them in Brotherhood. The band was signed to RCA, but were hindered by the members' lingering contractual obligations to Columbia Records from their Raiders work. The power trio released three albums, two under the Brotherhood name in 1968 and 1969 and a third album in 1969 called Joyride under the name Friendsound. Joyride was an experimental album that was included on the 1979 Nurse with Wound list. The cover art for this album was illustrated by Edna Marie O'Dowd. Ms. O'Dowd was an emerging artist and a friend of Drake Levin during the recording of the album.
Guitars
Levin owned and played a triple-pickup Epiphone Crestwood Custom Deluxe in his early Raiders days, including the pilot episode of Where The Action Is. A few TV performances appearances of the band showed Drake playing a Mosrite six- and 12-string doubleneck that was offered to him from Mosrite, but he found it too heavy to play comfortably. He was also seen televised with a Vox Phantom VI, because of the band's Vox endorsement deal. However, he did not use them live or even in the studio as he thought they were poorly made instruments. Drake did use bandmate Phil Volk's 1960 Fender Stratocaster in the studio. In his later years, Levin played a reissue 62 Fender Stratocaster and a Fender Telecaster. However, he is most widely associated with his cherry red 1963 Epiphone Sheraton, with which he recorded his double-tracked guitar solo on "Just Like Me." After his death, it was purchased by the Musicians Hall of Fame in Nashville, TN in early 2010, but it was severely damaged just a couple of months later in the May 2010 Nashville flood.
Later career and death
Levin subsequently performed with artists such as Ananda Shankar, Emitt Rhodes, and Lee Michaels (on the album Barrel). He also participated in reunions of various ex-members of the Raiders, and worked with his friend Phil Volk on several occasions.
Drake Levin died of cancer July 4, 2009 at his home in San Francisco, with his wife Sandra at his side.

Chittamuru Ramaiya (Telugu: చిట్టమూరు రామయ్య) was a 19th and 20th century Theosophist and translator, and an associate of Annie Besant. The son of Chittamuru Sriramulu, he had five brothers Chittamuru Subbaramaiah, Chittamuru Krishnaiah, Chittamuru Subbarayudu, Chittamuru Lakshmaiah and Chittamuru Ramachandraiah. He completed a degree in Bachelor of Arts in Literature in the 19th century. He was associated with Annie Besant for some time at the Theosophical Society, Adyar, Madras, India.
He wrote many books on theosophy, including one titled Divya jnana saaramu, meaning "The Essence of Theosophy"; a second edition of this title was published by C.Subbarayudu, Manager, Vasantha Institute, Madras, in 1937. The book included one chapter, "Adrushya sahayulu", from a book titled Divya jnana deepika by his brother Subbaramaiah. He published another book, Brahma vidya darpanamu ("Hinduism in Light of Theosophy"), in 1941; this he dedicated to Annie Besant. He was also known for having translated the book At the Feet of the Master, attributed to J. Krishnamurti, into Telugu. [Parama-gurucharana-sannidhi. A translation by Ramayya of " At the Feet of the Master."] 1911.
Theosophical Publishing House and Vasantha Institute, Adayar, Madras (Chennai),
Below information is from Page 421 - Theosophist Magazine January 1931 to March 1931
How an altruistic and willing man can find means of serving the world and doing good amidst most untoward circumstances is exemplified in the life of C. Ramaiya, our late Joint General Secretary of the T.S. for South India.
He was born in 1867 and dropped his body at Adayar on 18 January last. He had his College education at the Madras Christian College and qualified as a school master. After several posts he became Headmaster of the Municipal High School at Cuddapah. The school was started in 1857 as a part of Thomas Babington Macaulay initiatives in education. I made acquaintance in 1896, which grew into close friendship. He joined Theosophical Society in 1897 at Cuddapah.
From the way in which he began his membership of the T.S. we were very hopeful of seeing him become an important worker for the T.S.
Instead of indulging in ease after the strenuous school work of the day in the schools, he took a great interest in leading the study class of the T.S. lodge at Cuddapah. Endowed with keen intellect geniality he was very useful, with his knowledge of Chemistry & allied subjects in helping the T.S. members in their studies. He was of the old type of school masters who would prepare the previous night for the next days class lessons. In the enervating malarial climate of Cuddapah he diligently discharged his duties as school master as the member of T.S. and as citizen to boot.
He resigned the position as Headmaster in the Municipal High School at Cuddapah in 1913 to give services completely to T.S. work and he undertook to travel and visit the widely scattered T.S. lodges in S. India. At the time of his resignation as Head of the School, a Theosophical High School was started in neighboring town (Proddatur) and the president of T.S asked him to accept the position of Head of that Institution. He was next asked to go to Madanapalle Theosophical High School in a similar position. In all the places where he served as a schoolmaster his contemporaries as well as his students, had a uniform love and respect for him. The Inspecting Officers of the Department had a great regard and admiration for him.
In 1918 he took up the work of visiting T.S. Lodges and he came to live at Adayar. He travelled far and wide in South India in his new role and also accepted one responsible work after another and performed them all to the entire satisfaction of those who gave him the work. At the time of his death he held following positions:
1. Assistant to C. Jinarajadasa
2. Joint General Secretary of the T.S.in South India
3. Secretary of Vasanta Institute
4. Secretary of Bharata Samaja
5. Editor of Bharata Dharma
6. Editor of Divyajnana-Dipika and
7. Manager for sometime of Dharmajyoti
He did all the work though his health was poor and suffering from diabetes.
He leaves an open place in Adayar and it is not easy to fill this satisfactorily. He devotion to the Great Ones and Their representatives was unshakable and sincere.

KJEL (103.7 FM) is a radio station licensed to Lebanon, Missouri, United States that broadcasts a country music format. Established in 1973, the station is owned by Alpha Media, through licensee Alpha Media Licensee LLC.
KJEL is a full service country station serving Lebanon and the surrounding area. It provides Fox News Radio at the beginning of the hour, then regional news around the Lebanon area. The station also carries the St. Louis Cardinals.
History
KJEL-FM signed on October 20, 1973 under the ownership of Risner Broadcasting. At the outset, 60 percent of the station's programming was simulcast with KJEL (1080 AM, now KBNN on 750), which signed on the same day with middle of the road music and news programming. In 1980, the KJEL stations were sold to a group of businesspeople under the name KJEL, Inc. for $375,000. By 1981, KJEL-FM was only simulcasting 10 percent of its programming with the AM station, which had affiliated with the ABC Entertainment Network and changed to a country music format while retaining its news programming; the following year, the two stations began simulcasting full-time.
Ozark Broadcasting purchased the KJEL stations for $450,000 in 1983; this made the stations part of the Shepherd Group. Shepherd changed KJEL-FM's call letters to KIRK on October 3, 1983. By 1985, KIRK was programming a country music format separate from KJEL; in 1988, the station changed to an adult contemporary format. KIRK returned to country music in 1994, simulcasting 25 percent of its programming with KJEL; on December 1, 1996, the KJEL call letters (without the "-FM" suffix) returned to the station, after the AM station changed to talk radio station KBNN.
In March 2007, GoodRadio.TV LLC agreed to buy the Shepherd Group's stations, including KJEL, for $30.6 million. In 2013, GoodRadio.TV was merged into Digity, LLC (both companies were controlled by Dean Goodman) as part of Digity's acquisition of NextMedia. Effective February 25, 2016, Digity was acquired by Alpha Media for $264 million.

Georgy Vyacheslavovich Kurdyumov (; 14 February 1902 – 6 July 1996) was a Soviet metallurgist and physicist. He went on to become one of the most famous metallurgist of his time in the Soviet Union. When the Institute of Solid State Physics was established on February 15, 1963, he was one of the main organizers of the institute.
Early days
Georgii Kurdyumov was born on February 14, 1902 in Rylsk, Kursk Province, Russian Empire. His father was a priest. He trained as a physicist at the Ioffe Institute in Saint Petersburg. As a young scientist, he took interest in metallurgy and after obtaining his diploma, he was one of the 220 Soviet Union scientists who were allowed to spend time abroad. He went to Germany, and worked with George Sachs in Berlin. Their collaboration resulted in Kurdyumov-Sachs (K-S) orientation.
Career
After he moved back to the Soviet Union, he went to Ukraine and became one of the founders of the Dnepropetrovsk Physico-Technical Institute in Dnipropetrovsk. He was appointed director of the institute. After the Second World War, he and the institute moved to Moscow. He was Director of the Institute for Physical Metallurgy of the Central Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy in Moscow from 1944 to 1978. He also helped to establish the Laboratory for Metal Physics in Ukraine. The Laboratory for Metal Physics was founded on November 15, 1945, by the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (now the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). From 1945 to 1951, he was the head of the laboratory. Today it has been renamed as G. V. Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics.
The Institute of Solid State Physics was established by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences) on February 15, 1963; he, together with Yuri Osipyan and Cheslav Kopetsky, were the main organizers of institute. He also supervised the PhD thesis of Osipyan. He was a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.
He made major contributions to the development of physical metallurgy. He performed pioneering work in the study of martensitic transformation in crystalline materials that are of fundamental importance for the theory of phase transitions and heat treatment of steels and alloys.
He was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor (March 13, 1969), five Orders of Lenin (1954, 1962, 1969, 1975 and 1982), the Order of the October Revolution (1972), and two Orders of the Red Banner (1945 and 1958).

Freedom Fight / Open The Freedom Gate is a series of professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) events produced by Dragon Gate USA.
Background
Freedom Fight will feature an undetermined number of professional wrestling matches that will involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers will be portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events that build tension and culminate into a wrestling match or series of matches.
The main emphasis on this show is to inaugurate the company's title, the Open the Freedom Gate Championship. There will be a 14-man tournament featuring four qualifying matches before leading to a final, which will be contested as a four-way elimination match between the winners. The first qualifier announced was a three-way match between Mike Quackenbush, Super Crazy, and Cima in a match billed as a "salute" to the trainer of all three men, Jorge Rivera. It was later announced Rivera was added to the match, making it a four-way. Proceeding this was the announcement of two singles matches being entitled, "Next Level" and "Redemption". The former will be pitting Davey Richards against one-half of the Open the Twin Gate Champions Yamato. The other singles match was announced on November 3 to be Brian Kendrick versus BxB Hulk. There was also a six-way match announced with the first two competitors for the match being named as Nick and Matt Jackson. The final four participants were announced on November 3, giving the match a theme, "Generation New", as it highlights younger wrestlers. The names announced were: Jigsaw, Johnny Gargano, Lince Dorado, and Gran Akuma.
Following their previous two encounters at Enter the Dragon and Untouchable, Dragon Kid and Masato Yoshino have developed a rivalry to determine who is the better competitor. With Dragon Kid winning both times, a frustrated Yoshino confronted his rival at the latter show, which also drew Yoshino's tag team partner Naruki Doi (the two together are known as Speed Muscle) into the conflict, as well as Shingo Takagi coming to the aid of Dragon Kid. This prompted the company to sign a tag team match featuring both parties at this show.

Friends of the British Overseas Territories (FOTBOT) is a charitable and youth organisation based in the United Kingdom that seeks to raise awareness of the fourteen British Overseas Territories (BOTs) by promoting their culture, history and bio-diversity. As an educational charity, it facilitates visits to BOTs for mainland British students, and has also pledged to alleviate certain financial constraints faced in the UK by students from the BOTs themselves. Such efforts are supported by regular fundraising activities, as well as through the backing of several prominent British politicians.
Founded in Leeds by sole Chief Executive, Philip Smith, in 2013, FOTBOT has since been consulted by various national media organisations on articles regarding British relations with its dependencies. At least two university associations have been founded in assistance of the organisation's objectives.
Foundation and development
The organisation was founded in 2013 by Philip Smith, predominantly as a vehicle to foster ties between the young people of the United Kingdom and the sparsely located British Overseas Territories (BOTs), a group of 16 dependencies under the ultimate sovereignty and jurisdiction of the UK, having been former colonies of the British Empire. Its headquarters are currently based in Leeds, a city in Yorkshire.
Its unofficial flag, reminiscent of that of many BOTs and depicted only on membership badges, was the result of an internal design competition and is registered with the Flags of the World association. Though falling outside of its stated charitable aims, FOTBOT is regularly consulted by media organisations regarding political developments in the BOTs. Instances have included an article published by The i, in which the charity expressed its disappointment that BOTs, excluding Gibraltar, would be unable to vote in the 2016 European Union membership referendum; more emotively, FOTBOT were quoted in The Times as considering the British Government's 2018 motion to demand that the British Virgin Islands publicly declare the owners of its businesses as "bring[ing] in the feeling of a colonial master again". Several politicians have declared their support for the organisation, including Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Andrew Rosindell, former Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, and Julia Reid, a UK Independence Party (UKIP) Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Historically, at least two student unions, at the universities of Cambridge and Newcastle respectively, have been affiliated with membership societies seeking to further the objectives of FOTBOT.
Activities
Established foremostly as a youth organisation, FOTBOT have oriented much of their activities toward educating young people, a motivation that has facilitated short excursions for British students to BOTs, as well as for students from the BOTs themselves to visit other dependencies and study in the UK without undue financial burden. In this vein, FOTBOT was partnered in a project headed by geographer Stewart McPherson, 'Treasure Islands', which "aim[ed] to showcase the wildlife, cultures and history of all of the UK Overseas Territories" by dispersing educative materials across the UK.
As an organisation, FOTBOT host regular ticketed events that range from formal functions to round-table discussions surrounding the cultural and political situation of the BOTs; past committees have explored the possibility of BOT representation in the UK Parliament, as well as the challenges of day-to-day governance in British protectorates.

Costel Iancu (known in the press as Dom' Costel, Mr. Costel) is a Romanian politician who has been involved in a scandal in which he was accused of kidnapping local businessmen and taking photographs of them naked and in chains.
Political career
A member of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (PD-L), Iancu won a term as a member of the Dolj County Council. He was also the PD-L Senate candidate in Calafat, and although he won the most votes, because he had less than 50% of the votes, he lost his place during the redistribution of the votes.
On 25 February 2009, he was named by the government as the Director of the National Administration of Land Improvement, a function that is equivalent with a secretary of state in the Ministry of Agriculture. Following the kidnappings scandal which reached the press, he resigned.
Kidnappings
Andrei Alexandru (from Vâlcea County, residing in Austria) claims he was kidnapped in 2006, together with his wife. On the ring road of Craiova, he was caught between a Volkswagen Touareg and several other cars. Alexandru claimed that around 10-15 people got out of the cars, including Iancu, who began to hit him with the fists in the head, then took him in the Volkswagen, while holding a gun to his neck.
According to Andrei Alexandru, he was held overnight and released only after he said he will make Iancu an associate at his company.
In the testimony against Iancu, another victim, Constantin Niţu claimed that Iancu kicked him, after which he undressed, chained him and urinated on him, kept him in the rain and cold for several days, during which he took a number of photographs. Niţu claimed Iancu said he did the same with a number of other people and he knows how to keep people quiet, showing his gun and claiming he'd shoot both Niţu and his father.
Another victim, Adrian Radu (from Mehedinți) said that together with five men, Iancu took him to a hangar where they took his mobile phone and some of the associates of Iancu, Robert Ştefăniţă Bîltac ann Geromin Victor Bîltac began hitting him with the fists in the face and threatening they'll kill him with a pistol.
Organized Crime department of the police discovered photographs with one of the victims, naked and in chains while wearing a sign saying "I am a rag. Don't do like me, I made a mistake with Mr. Costel". According to the prosecutors, Iancu kept the photos for intimidating other people who opposed him.
Trial
On October 27, 2006, the prosecutors accused him of organized crime, kidnapping, threats and violence. Although the prosecutors asked to be taken in custody by the police, the Dolj Courthouse denied this.
The case was brought to trial in March 2009, Iancu being accused together with his accomplices:
Marian Sandu, formerly known as Cristescu, aka Fibră - an associate of Ion Clămparu
Laurenţiu Gheorghe Capotescu aka Pătatu'
Lucian, Geromin Victor and Robert Ştefăniţă Bîltac
In the first trial, at the Dolj Courthouse, he was found not guilty, the judge Stan Prodănescu retiring short time after this. The same decision was found at the Court of Appeals and, on 15 November 2011, the High Court of Cassation and Justice ended the trial with a final and irrevocable verdict of "not guilty".
Two of the three judges at the High Court of Cassation and Justice retired during the trial in order to avoid the case and one of those judges being replaced with a controversial judge, Sofica Dumitraşcu, the judge known for releasing convicted terrorist Omar Hayssam.

Edward William Cooke (27 March 1811 – 4 January 1880) was an English landscape and marine painter, and gardener.
Life and work
Cooke was born in Pentonville, London, the son of well-known line engraver George Cooke; his uncle, William Bernard Cooke (1778–1855), was also a line engraver of note, and Edward was raised in the company of artists. He was a precocious draughtsman and a skilled engraver from an early age, displayed an equal preference for marine subjects (in special in sailing ships) and published his "Shipping and Craft" – a series of accomplished engravings – when he was 18, in 1829. He benefited from the advice of many of his father's associates, notably Clarkson Stanfield (whose principal marine follower he became) and David Roberts. Cooke began painting in oils in 1833, took formal lessons from James Stark in 1834 and first exhibited at the Royal Academy and British Institution in 1835, by which time his style was essentially formed.
Remarkably of his few drawings of ships, boats, and coastal views appear in the childhood albums of Edward William Cooke since age of four. Many of his earlier drawings are seemed to favor Dutch pastoral landscapes and animal subjects. Numerous of his drawings are influenced by Nicolaes Berghem [Berchem], Paulus Potter, or Karel Dujardin.
He went on to travel and paint with great industry at home and abroad, indulging his love of the 17th-century Dutch marine artists with a visit to the Netherlands in 1837. He returned regularly over the next 23 years, studying the effects of the coastal landscape and light, as well as the works of the country's Old Masters, resulting in highly successful paintings. These included 'Beaching a Pink at Scheveningen' (National Maritime Museum, London), which he exhibited in 1855 at the Royal Academy, of which he was an Associate from 1851. He went on to travel in Scandinavia, Spain, North Africa and, above all, to Venice. In 1858, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.
Cooke was "particularly attracted by the Isle of Wight, and on his formative visit of 1835 he made a thorough study of its fishing boats and lobster pots; above all he delighted in the beaches strewn with rocks of various kinds, fishing tackle, breakwaters and small timber-propped jetties."
He also had serious natural history and geological interests, being a Fellow of the Linnean Society, Fellow of the Geological Society and Fellow of the Zoological Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries. In the 1840s he helped his friend, the horticulturist, James Bateman fit out and design the gardens at Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire, in particular the orchids and rhododendrons. His geological interests in particular led to his election as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863 and he became a Royal Academician the following year.
In 1842 John Edward Gray named a species of boa, Corallus cookii, in Cooke's honor.

Rabbi Sholom Shachne Zohn (1910–2012) former dean of the Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, who later lived in Jerusalem, Israel.
Biography
When Shachne was 13 years of age he began to receive religious training in the Mordechai Rosenblatt Talmud Torah while also attending public school on the East Side of Manhattan. His father was very busy with his cap business, and so he entrusted Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Herman with the religious upbringing of young Shachna. Rabbi Herman eventually convinced the lad to study at the Yeshiva in New Haven, Connecticut where a young Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg also studied at Rabbi Herman's behest.
In his youth, he briefly studied Talmud in Yeshiva University and before traveling to Europe to study under Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz in the Yeshiva in Kaminetz and then in Mir Yeshiva. While in Europe, he married Liba Gulevsky. Before returning to America, Rabbi Zohn developed a close student relationship with the Jewish rabbinical leader of the time, Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan. Upon returning to America in anticipation of the Holocaust, he assumed a position in Torah Vodaas (in Brooklyn as a professor of Talmud, eventually becoming one of the school's deans. Eventually, Rabbi Zohn retired from his position in Torah Vodaas to immigrate to Israel. There, Rabbi Schachne Zohn headed for forty years a study group for adult men in Jerusalem which analyzed sacrificial laws in a Talmudic context. He lived in the Ezrat Torah neighborhood of Jerusalem.
In the summer of 2008, Rabbi Shachna Zohn reported that he saw his former teacher Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan (with whom he studied Torah in pre-Holocaust Europe) in a dream and was told that the Geulah (Hebrew for Redemption) is imminent. This fact was publicized by Rabbi Tzvi Mayer Zilberberg and was later confirmed by Mishpacha Magazine.
Rabbi Zohn died on December 20, 2012.
Rabbi Shachne Zohn's son, Rabbi Elchonon Zohn, is the Founder and Director of the Chevra Kadisha of the Rabbinical Council of Queens since 1981.

Norwegians in Finland are immigrants born in Norway, citizens of Norway or speakers of the Norwegian language living in Finland.
History
In 1872, Hans Gutzeit, a Norwegian, founded a sawmill in Kotka, which grew to be Stora Enso, which still operates. Gutzeit brought at least 200 sawmill workers from Norway, of which some brought their family as well. Many of them settled in Finland permanently, and established communities in the middle of Finnish rural regions. Mass migration was rare in Finland until this point. Norwegians had a significant impact in Kotka. In 1875 there were 130-140 Norwegians in Kotka, one sixth of the population. Norwegians also established communities in Oulu, and founded several sawmills across Finland. Norwegians had an notable presence in Kemi. The tenth Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari is a descendant of the sawmill workers.
Finns had an hatred towards Norwegians, since they had a higher pay and a higher position in the society. Norwegians usually didn't pay taxes. In the 1920s and 1930s, most Norwegians acquired Finnish citizenship. In 1882, Norwegians started to be assimilated into the Finnish culture. However, Finns with Norwegian ancestry still retain their Norwegian identity.
Demographics
According to the International migrant stock: The 2017 revision, there were 2,156 Norwegian immigrants living in Finland. Most of them live in Helsinki, Oulu and Northern Finland.
They make the most in Utsjoki (2.65%), Larsmo (0.77%) and Enontekiö (0.69%).
Of the Norwegian citizens, 58.8% are male. 337 Norwegian men are in a registered relationship with a Finnish woman. 45.4% of Norwegians are employed, 7.7% unemployed and 46.9% outside the labour force. Of the labour force, 85.6% are employed and 14.4% unemployed. There were 44 Norwegian entrepreneurs in 2017.
Norwegian language in Finland
The northernmost municipalities of Finland (Inari, Enontekiö and Utsjoki) want to increase teaching of the Norwegian language in schools. The school curriculum however doesn't include Norwegian and it can only be learned as an optional subject. Enontekiö tries to get Norwegian to be included in the school curriculum, since the inhabitants of Enontekiö have many connections and bonds to Norway. In Ivalo ala-aste, 56 pupils learn Norwegian. Oulu considers making Norwegian one of the official languages. Norwegian can be learned several colleges.

Tsuji Kakō (1870 in Kyoto – 1931) was a Japanese painter, trained by Kōno Bairei both in the Maruyama and Shijō schools of painting. His Zen training, which he started in 1899, influenced much of his painting style and led to his name being associated with the unconventional.
Tsuji Kakō became one of the leading figures of the Shijō and Maruyama movements, with Takeuchi Seihō, Kikuchi Hōbun, Taniguchi Kōkyō and Yamamoto Shunkyo. Because of his individual approach and his refusal to be politically correct, Kakō's work never acquired the same appeal and cachet as that of his contemporaries.
In the last ten years of the Meiji era, Kakō became preoccupied with the study of waves, his style breaking with tradition and becoming highly idiosyncratic. During this period Kakō also experimented with the use of colour. His lack of conformity adversely affected his popularity; even so his work came in for scrutiny and critical commentary in many contemporary articles.

Paul Ehmayr (born October 28, 1909 in Vienna, † 1993 in Linz; sometimes incorrectly spelled as Ehmayer, Ehmeier or Ehmeyer) was a German-Austrian rocket engineer. He was a precision mechanic. His masterpiece was a barometer.
Due to the high level of unemployment in Austria, Ehmayr went to Mecklenburg in 1927, then to Berlin. There he worked from 1930 as part of the engineering team around Hermann Oberth, Rudolf Nebel and Klaus Riedel (together with Wernher von Braun, , Hans Bermüller, Hans Hüter, Kurt Heinisch and Helmuth Zoike) in the development, especially in the construction and experiments with the first rockets powered by liquid gas.
Development and tests initially took place in the Chemisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, financially supported by the Army Weapons Office. When Hermann Oberth returned to Romania, the team continued its activities in the newly founded Berlin-Reinickendorf rocket airfield where they reused the rocket stand featured in the movie "Woman in the Moon". The jointly developed rockets included the Oberth cone nozzle ("Kegeldüse"), different versions of the Repulsor, the I-III and the Magdeburg pilot rocket (10-L)
The activities of the Verein für Raumschifffahrt and at Raketenflugplatz Berlin have been under strict surveillance. since the National Socialists came to power in the spring of 1933. After the Gestapo confiscated all documents in the same year, the organization and the rocket airfield were finally closed in June 1934
Since then, private rocket attempts have been prohibited. - all activities have now been continued under the patronage of the German Wehrmacht in the Kummersdorf Army Research Center, later in the Peenemünde Army Research Center
From then on Ehmayr worked in various companies as a technical employee until he returned to Austria together with his wife and son at the end of the war. There he lived first in Wels, then until his death in 1993 in Linz.

The Formosan clouded leopard is an extinct clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) population that was endemic to Taiwan. Camera trapping studies carried out in several protected areas in Taiwan between 1997 and 2012 did not record any clouded leopard. The population is listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List.
Taxonomy
Felis nebulosa was the scientific name proposed by Edward Griffith in 1821 who first described a skin of a clouded leopard that was brought alive from Canton Province in China to the menagerie at Exeter Exchange in London.
Leopardus brachyurus was proposed by Robert Swinhoe in 1862 who described a skin of a clouded leopard from Formosa.
It was later considered the clouded leopard subspecies Neofelis nebulosa brachyurus. However, genetic analysis of hair samples of Neofelis specimens revealed that the Formosan clouded leopard is not distinct from the mainland clouded leopard. The Formosan clouded leopard is therefore currently not recognised as a distinct clouded leopard subspecies.
Characteristics
It was first described in 1862 on the basis of a traded skin with an incomplete tail. Its fur colour is pale to tawny, and it has large cloud-like markings on the shoulders and flanks with a few spots within the clouds. In his first description of four Formosan clouded leopard skins, Swinhoe noted the shortness of its tail, which is about one-half the length of clouded leopard specimens from the Himalayas. It was Taiwan's second-largest carnivore, after the Formosan black bear.
Last efforts
An interview survey conducted in 1986 among 70 indigenous Taiwanese hunters revealed that they sighted a Formosan clouded leopard in the Tawu Mountain area in 1983 for the last time.
In 1989, the skin of a young individual was found in the Taroko National Park area, which is the last confirmed record.
Pugmarks reported in the 1990s near Yushan National Park were suspected, but not confirmed to be of a clouded leopard.
It has been assumed that clouded leopards retreated into the Yushan Range and Tawu Mountain after extensive logging of natural habitat. Today, the Tawu Mountain Nature Reserve is a protected area encompassing about . It harbours the largest remaining primary forest in southern Taiwan and comprises tropical and subtropical rainforest as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forest and temperate coniferous forest.
Between 1997 and 2012, camera trapping surveys were conducted in more than 1,450 sites in potentially suitable habitats across Taiwan, from the seashore to an elevation of , in fragmented lowlands and inside protected areas. This survey also included 13,000 camera trap nights between 2000 and 2004 in Tawu Mountain Nature Reserve and the adjacent Twin Ghost Lake Important Wildlife Area. During a nationwide survey effort of 128,349 camera trap days, 12 potential prey species were recorded, including the sambar (Rusa unicolor), the Formosan serow (Capricornis swinhoei), Reeves's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), the Formosan macaque (Macaca cyclopis) Swinhoe's pheasant (Lophura swinhoii) and rodents. However, not a single clouded leopard was recorded. It is therefore considered extirpated.
Alleged sightings
In the summer of 2018, two different groups of rangers allegedly sighted a clouded leopard in Taitung County. One group claimed to have seen an individual climbing a tree and hunting goats on a cliff. The other group contended to have observed an individual darting past a scooter on a road and climbing into a tree.
Cultural influence
The clouded leopard is highly respected by the Rukai people culture who believe that their ancestors followed a clouded leopard to their ancestral land. They consider the hunting of clouded leopards a taboo. In Paiwan culture, the pelt of clouded leopard can only be worn by the nobility.
In both cultures, it is believed that the clouded leopard and the Formosan black bear are originally white, until one day they decided to paint each other. The bear meticulously painted the leopard with exquisite patterns. The clouded leopard painted the bear all black, except for the V-shaped area before the chest, which remained white for various reasons depending on the version of the story. As an apology for the bad work, now the clouded leopards only eat a part of their prey, leaving the rest for the bear.

Diamond Donner was a supporting actress in Broadway and vaudeville entertainment in the early 20th century.
Biography
Donner was born in Boston and graduated from Wellesley College in 1901.
She accompanied Irene Bentley and a large company of actors who appeared at the Madison Square Theatre, Broadway (Manhattan) and 24th Street, in December 1903. The troupe staged a production of The Girl from Dixie.
In September 1903 she appeared in The Prince of Pilsen at the Tremont Theatre in Boston.
Donner acted the part of Janet Gramercy, fiancee of Algy de Peyster, in the musical The Man From China. Its New York City debut came on May 2, 1904, at the Majestic Theatre. The play featured Charles A. Bigelow as Peter Pudge, a wandering musician and John A. Armstrong as Algy. There were twenty-seven musical numbers divided equally between two acts.
Klaw & Erlanger opened the season for the New Amsterdam Theater rooftop venue Aerial Gardens with a local review, Lifting the Lid, on Monday, June 5, 1905. The entertainment was produced by John J. McNally and featured Fay Templeton, Donner, Louis Harrison, Virginia Earle, and others. The venue was a successful attraction the previous summer and had been improved with new decorations and alterations.
Donner was a cast member of Klaw & Erlanger's revival of Humpty Dumpty when it was staged at the New York Theatre in March 1906. Earlier the play was presented at Drury Lane and at the New Amsterdam Theatre the previous summer. Frank Moulan continued in the role of Little Mary as did William C. Schrode, who depicted the Clown.
In April 1906 Donner appeared in The District Leader at Wallack's Theatre at 254 West 42nd Street. The two-act musical comedy drama was written by Joseph E. Howard. Its plot was traditional, involving district politics.
In September 1906 Donner applied to the Greenwich, Connecticut Probate Court to have her mother, Louella Donner, committed to a sanitarium. The probate court requested the appointment of two doctors to inquire as to the mental condition of her mother. Donner said she had awakened a few weeks before to find her mother was insane. Louella Donner was sent out west for a time before being brought to Greenwich in August. She escaped from Ardendale Sanitarium at Cos Cob, near the residence of Clyde Fitch, after jumping out of a second-floor window. She had employed a corset steel to pick the lock on the window. Donner came to Greenwich when her mother was returned to the sanitarium superintendent by the police, and it was discovered she had not been committed.
The Maestro's Masterpiece by Edward Locke was produced by Arthur Hammerstein at the Columbia Theatre in Washington, D.C., in February 1911. Donner was in this play of grand opera life in English. She sang the part of Micaela in Carmen with the Boston Opera Company in January 1913. Previously she debuted as Mimi, which proved to be one of the most significant triumphs of the season.

Two human polls comprised the 1966 NCAA University Division football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.
Legend
AP Poll
The final AP Poll was released in early December, at the end of the 1966 regular season. In the previous season, the final poll was released in January for the first time, after the bowl games, but not in 1966 or 1967.
The AP Poll ranked only the top ten teams from 1962 through 1967.
Final Coaches' poll
The final UPI Coaches Poll was released prior to the bowl games, in late November.Notre Dame received twenty of the 35 first-place votes; Michigan State received ten, Alabama four, and UCLA one.
Source:
Notre Dame did not participate in bowl games from 1925 through 1968.
Prior to the 1975 season, the Big Ten and Pac-8 conferences allowed only one postseason participant each, for the Rose Bowl.
Big Ten champion Michigan State was barred from participation in the Rose Bowl due to the conference's no-repeat rule, in effect from 1946 through 1971.
The Ivy League has prohibited its members from participating in postseason football since the league was officially formed in 1954.

Radley is a London-based, British accessories brand which designs and manufactures handbags, purses and other women's accessories for UK and international markets. The brand was founded by Lowell Harder in 1998. Justin Stead is the current CEO of the brand and was appointed in May 2015.
History
Early years
Radley founder and current Creative Director, Australian Lowell Harder, began working in the accessories industry as a weekend stallholder on London's Camden Market in 1984 selling Indian men's accessories brand Hidesign. Harder began working with the Hidesign design team and together developed new designs for the UK market.
Harder's business with Hidesign soon outgrew its market stall setting and needed increased investment and infrastructure which was supplied by the handbag company Tula Group in 1991. With the backing of the Tula Group, Harder was able to continue with Hidesign and in 1997, with a new working partner, develop a new women's accessories brand, Radley.
‘Harder launched it [Radley] in 1998 after becoming "fed up" with seeing bags in the same colours – such as black and navy. Instead she wanted to create something different and colourful,' wrote Drapers trade magazine in an interview with Harder in 2012.
Initial sales of Radley were low, however through a pre-existing relationship with Department store John Lewis via Hidesign, John Lewis began to trial a selection of Radley designs. Radley became a success for John Lewis, which then led to an interest from other UK based department stores.
Scottie dog logo
In an October 2012 interview with Drapers trade magazine, Radley founder Lowell Harder said of the conception of the brand's dog shaped logo 'we were experimenting with different things and one of the designers came-up with it. We hung it off a bag and people loved it.'
The dog logo, which hung from the bag strap, was put on a few ranges in the collection for Autumn/Winter 2000 but was added to most of the range by 2001 because of increased interest from customers. After the departure of Harder in December 2010, the new design team implemented a new version of the dog logo which saw a negative reception from the consumer. In her October 2012 Drapers magazine interview, she explained why the original design of the logo was reinstated on her return 'He was changed after I left and was made too butch. The idea of him was that he was meant to look cute and fun so we are going back to that…it was important to us that we changed him back.'
First buy-out
With the increased sales of Radley in 2002, Harder led a buyout of Tula Group from its founding members. Tula and Hidesign were maintained as brands
Second buy-out
Phoenix Equity Partners purchased a majority stake of Radley in a £45m deal in March 2006. It was listed again for sale the following December in 2007. The majority stake was purchased in a second buyout by private equity fund Exponent Private Equity in a transaction valued at £130m. Exponent Private Equity presently maintains their majority ownership to this day alongside Radley's management team and Phoenix Equity Partners reinvested as minority stakeholders.
Retail
UK
The company's first store opened in 2005 on London's King's Road. There are currently 2 full-price Radley stores and 16 outlets in the UK. The brand is also currently stocked in a number of other retail locations and department stores across the UK including British retailers Fenwick Ltd, John Lewis and House of Fraser.
International
Radley is currently stocked in Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, New Zealand and The Netherlands at Bataviastad Outlet Shopping Center. The bags are also available at Macy's in the United States.
Online
Radley started online trading in 2007 and is currently stocked online in the UK by John Lewis, House of Fraser, Next and Shop Direct.
Rebranding
The company re-branded in Autumn 2009 to Radley London.
Collaborations
In 2013, Radley collaborated with the Scottish fashion designer Holly Fulton for a capsule collection of accessories. In 2010, and again in 2013, Radley announced a partnership with Harris Tweed, to incorporate the Scottish textiles into their handbag designs. There have also been capsule collections with the Victoria & Albert Museum and illustrators William Grill, Emma Cowlam and Rory Crichton.
Brand ambassadors
From Spring/Summer 2012 through to Spring/Summer 2013, Vogue UK's contributing Editor Laura Bailey was Radley's Brand Ambassador. The partnership also saw the launch of two capsule collections co-designed by Bailey. For Autumn/Winter 2013, British model Erin O'Connor appeared in Radley's UK advertising campaign.
Product offering
The brand currently produces handbags, small leather goods, luggage, hats, scarves, gloves, eyewear, casual footwear, watches, gifts and stationery. Radley launched their signature fragrance Radley London in March 2015. The fragrance is available in an Eau De Parfum, body wash and body lotion.
Charity

The Megalithic Walls of Altamura () are defensive walls dating back to the 4th century BCE. They were the city walls of the ancient city of Altamura, Italy. Nowadays, only a few parts of the original wall remain; the original track of the wall spanned over a length of about 3.6 km. They were about 4 meters high, while the base of the walls was about 5 meters wide.
The megalithic walls are often confused with the city walls of today's Altamura historic center, of which fragments remain today in some parts as well. The two walls refer to different time periods and to different parts of the city: the megalithic walls refer to the ancient city, which was later abandoned or sacked, while the walls of Altamura historic center refer to the period starting from the founding of Altamura by king Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (13th century AD).
Cesare Orlandi
Cesare Orlandi, in his work Delle città d'Italia (1770), mentioned the wall and suggested that the name of the city of Altamura might be due to its megalithic walls. He also mentioned a large number of archaeological findings of that period, which occurred very close the megalithic walls and that now have been lost.
Rocca maps
Inside Rocca map P/33, commissioned by Angelo Rocca and stored inside Angelica Library, Rome, some memorial stones can be seen on the megalithic walls. At the end of the 16th century, those memorial stones were still present, before being destroyed at a certain point.

Morten Brander Knudsen (born 28 April 1995) is a Danish footballer who plays as a central midfielder for German club Phönix Lübeck.
Career
Knudsen was signed by Italian club Inter Milan in January 2013, from Danish club Midtjylland, as a youth. He spent a year and a half in Inter's reserve team.
On 21 August 2014 Knudsen was farmed to affiliated club Prato in a temporary deal. The club signed several players from Inter as part of the partnership agreement. On 13 August 2015 the loan deal was renewed.
On 15 September 2017, Knudsen signed an amateur contract with Norwegian club Sarpsborg 08. The club could not offer him a professional contract because they had to many foreign players in the squad, so Knudsen was incorporated in the reserve squad.
On 23 January 2018, it was announced that Knudsen had signed with Vendsyssel FF. In June 2021, his contract with the club expired amidst uncertain circumstances at the club, where the foreign owners had left shortly after survival in the Danish 1st Division became a fact.
On 5 August 2021, Knudsen joined German club 1. FC Phönix Lübeck.
International career
Knudsen made his competitive debut for Denmark youth team on 12 October 2011, a 4–1 win against Italy U17. Denmark qualified from 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Championship qualifying round. However, Knudsen was dropped from the squad for the elite round. Knudsen was re-selected to 2014 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualifying round. Knudsen was a substitute of Mikkel Wohlgemuth and Johannes Ritter, respectively.

Alex Lely (born 30 June 1973) is a Dutch former professional pool player. Lely won the 1999 World Pool Masters after defeating Efren Reyes 7–5, and reached the final in 2000 but lost to Ralf Souquet 7–3. He is a two-time European champion having won the nine-ball and eight-ball at the 2005 European Pool Championships.
Lely has competed for the European team at the Mosconi Cup on four occasions in 1999, 2005, 2008 and 2009. Lely would be a part of the successful team at the 2008 Mosconi Cup when acting as the teams non-playing captain. In 2020, he took over as the team captain of the European team from Marcus Chamat. Lely is a multiple time champion of events on the Euro Tour, first winning the 1999 German Open, before taking two more events in 2005 and 2006.
Career
Alex Lely was born 30 June 1973 in the Hague, Netherlands. He plays pool right-handed. Lely turned professional in 1998, and the following year won his first major tournament, the World Pool Masters. He defeated Efren Reyes in the final 7–5. Lely also collected autographs from his opponents in the competition. The same season, Lely debuted for the European Mosconi Cup team in the 1999 event, thanks to his win at the Masters. Lely also won his first Euro Tour event, defeating Francisco Bustamante in the final of the 1999 German Open.
In 2000, Lely reached his first final at the European Pool Championships, losing to Oliver Ortmann in the straight pool event. In defence of his championship, Lely also made it to the final of the 2000 World Pool Masters. However, Lely would lose the final 3–7 to Ralf Souquet.
Lely did not win any major titles for the next few seasons. He played in the 2001 World Games in both men's snooker and men's pool events, but lost in the last 16 in both events. In 2003, he once again reached the later stages at the World Pool Masters, this time finishing as a losing semifinalist to Hsia Hui-Kai 8–4. This was the furthest that Lely would progress in the competition, as he finished in the quarter-finals in both 2004 and 2005 and did not appear in the competition in 2007. Lely won two of the events at the 2005 European Pool Championships, winning the nine-ball tournament beating Ralf Souquet in the final 9–8, and the eight-ball event defeating Tomasz Kapłan. He played for the second time at the 2005 Mosconi Cup, with the team being defeated 11–6. Before the 2007 WPA World Nine-ball Championship, he retired from the professional circuit; citing not wanting as much pressure to perform and tournaments not suiting his style of play.
He appeared again at the Mosconi Cup in 2008 and 2009 as the non-playing captain, winning in the former. He made an appearance at the 2015 Derby City Classic, where he finished in fourth place. Lely returned to the World Pool Masters at the 2018 event, which celebrated the 25th staging of the event, and saw a field of previous winners. Lely lost to Alex Pagulayan in the first round 8–4. In 2020, Lely was announced as the new captain of the European team for the Mosconi Cup, taking over from Marcus Chamat.

On September 23, 1985, Henson Airlines Flight 1517 crashed in Grottoes, Virginia, while on approach to the Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport. The two pilots and twelve passengers were killed.
Accident details
Henson Airlines Flight 1517 was a regular scheduled flight from Baltimore-Washington International Airport to Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport. The flight was operated on behalf of Piedmont Airlines as Piedmont Commuter.
At 9:59 am, Flight 1517 departed Baltimore bound for Shenandoah Valley. On board were twelve passengers and two crew members. The crew were Captain Martin Burns III, 27, and First Officer Zilda Spadaro-Wolan, 26.
The flight was routine until approach into Shenandoah Valley. At 10:14 am, Captain Burns told the Air Traffic Controller that he believed that the plane was too far west of his course. The controller tried several times to reach Flight 1517 by radio to no avail.
The search for Flight 1517 started at 10:25 am. At 6:42 pm, Civil Air Patrol located the crash site 6 miles east from the airport. Flight 1517 struck the southwest face of Hall Mountain at an elevation of 2,400 ft.
Zilda Spadaro-Wolan was the first female commercial airline pilot to perish in an airplane crash.
Cause
The US National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was a navigational error by the flight crew resulting from their use of the incorrect navigational facility and their failure to adequately monitor the flight instruments. Factors which contributed to the flightcrew's errors were:
(1) the nonstandardized navigational radio systems installed in the airline's Beech 99 fleet;
(2) intracockpit communication difficulties associated with high ambient noise levels in the airplane;
(3) inadequate training of the pilots by the airline;
(4) the first officer's limited multiengine and instrument flying experience;
(5) the pilots' limited experience in their positions in the Beech 99; and
(6) stress-inducing events in the lives of the pilots.
Also contributing to the accident was the inadequate surveillance of the airline by the Federal Aviation Administration which failed to detect the deficiencies which led to the accident.
Notable passengers
The passengers included playwright and actor Larry Shue and several executives of Beiersdorf, a personal care products company.

The spotted ground thrush (Geokichla guttata) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae. It is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, and possibly Mozambique.
Description
These birds are about 23 cm in length, with brown upper parts and white to off-white lower parts which are darkly spotted.
Habitat
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland. It is threatened by habitat loss.
Biology and behaviour
The spotted ground thrush spends much of its time in leaf-litter on the forest floor where it flicks through the leaves in search of small invertebrates, and despite its distinctive colouration, it is often difficult to see.
In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, the birds have distinctive winter and summer ranges. In winter these birds spend their time in remnant coastal forests, and in summer they move to forests further inland.
The birds lay bluish-coloured eggs in a cup-shaped nest.

The French-Hellenic Railway Co. (, or CFFH, full name: Cοmpanie franco-hellenique des chemins de fer, or ) was a railway company in Greece and Turkey which operated the former Chemins de fer Orientaux railway line from Alexandroupolis to Pythio, Ormenio and Svilengrad between 1929 and 1954. The company was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways in 1954.
History
After World War I and the subsequent Greek-Turkish War from 1919 to 1922 and finally peace in the form of the treaty of Lausanne, the Chemins de fer Orientaux (CO) ended up having a network straddling Turkey and Greece. This created operational difficulties, each country having now its own set of rules & regulations, currencies, languages, ... In order to resolve this situation, the CO decided to split itself into two companies: one for the Greek part, one for the Turkish part of the railway.
The CO created the "Compagnie franco-hellenique des chemins de fer" (CFFH) as a subsidiary company. The CFFH was incorporated in July 1929 as a French company with headquarters located in Paris. The CO transferred to the CFFH the Greek part of its line from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10km in Turkey serving the Edirne Karaagaç station and for about 3km between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria. Overall, this line was 165km long route from the Aegean Seaport city Alexandroupoli to Ormenio, the last station in Greece before entering Bulgaria. Pythion station was the junction towards Turkey. Along with the infrastructure, the CO transferred also some motive power and rolling stock to the CFFH.
The CFFH stock was transferred to CO shareholders on the basis of 1 CFFH stock for every 5 CO stock. These CFFH stock started trading on the market in July 1931.
Regarding the Edirne Karaagaç railway enclave so to speak, the CO retained operating rights over the section Svilengrad to Pythion to be able to reach Edirne and even Svilengrad. On the other hand, the CFFH retained operating rights through the Edirne section of the line to access the Greek part of the line past Edirne, through to Svilengrad. When the Turkish part of the CO was sold to the Turkish railways, these operating rights were also sold, enabling TCDD to reach Edirne with its own motive power, albeit with a CFFH driver. Likewise, when Hellenic State Railways (SEK) took over from the CFFH, they kept the operating right through Edirne Karaagaç. Operational working was facilitated by a provision in the treaty of Lausanne allowing for trains to cross the borders in and out of Karaagaç without border control not custom taxes. These rights survived until 1971 when TCDD inaugurated its own line from Pehlivanköy to Edirne & Svilengrad fully on Turkish territory.
At the same time, SEK built a bypass of Edirne also inaugurated in 1971. This bypass was between Marassia and Nea Vyssa, avoiding Turkish territory. The former CO station in Edirne Karaagaç, west of the Maritsa, was not no longer served, nor by TCDD nor by SEK and went into disuse.
The CFFH was the only railway connecting Turkey to Europe and enjoyed the related traffic and revenue. Some prestigious trains like the Orient Express transited on CFFH network. Otherwise, the CFFH did not generate any major traffic, either freight or passengers along its line. During the Greek Civil War until 1949, the trains operated only by daylight and were supplemented with empty freight cars in front of the locomotive and armed with escort to protect them from mines. SEK took over operations of the line and rolling stock, effective 1 January 1955, and the CFFH ceased to exist.
Locomotives
The CFFH fleet consisted of some of the engines from the CO. Only 2 engines are known to have been purchased by the CFFH. These are 2 E types engine, originally from the Austrian State railways.

An injection molding machine (also spelled as injection moulding machine in BrE), also known as an injection press, is a machine for manufacturing plastic products by the injection molding process. It consists of two main parts, an injection unit and a clamping unit.
Operation
Injection molding machine molds can be fastened in either a horizontal or vertical position. Most machines are horizontally oriented, but vertical machines are used in some niche applications such as insert molding, allowing the machine to take advantage of gravity. Some vertical machines also do not require the mold to be fastened. There are many ways to fasten the tools to the platens, the most common are manual clamps (both halves are bolted to the platens); however, hydraulic clamps (chocks are used to hold the tool in place) and magnetic clamps are also used. The magnetic and hydraulic clamps are used where fast tool changes are required.
The person designing the mold chooses whether the mold uses a cold runner system or a hot runner system to carry the plastic and fillers from the injection unit to the cavities.
A cold runner is a simple channel carved into the mold.
The plastic that fills the cold runner cools as the part cools and is then ejected with the part as a sprue.
A hot runner system is more complicated, often using cartridge heaters to keep the plastic in the runners hot as the part cools.
After the part is ejected, the plastic remaining in a hot runner is injected into the next part.
Types of injection molding machines
Machines are classified primarily by the type of driving systems they use: hydraulic, mechanical, electrical, or hybrid
Hydraulic
Hydraulic machines have historically been the only option available to molders until Nissei Plastic Industrial introduced the first all-electric injection molding machine in 1983. Hydraulic machines, although not nearly as precise, are the predominant type in most of the world, with the exception of Japan.
Mechanical
Mechanical type machines use the toggle system for building up tonnage on the clamps of the machine. Tonnage is required on all machines so that the clamps of the machine do not open due to the injection pressure. If the mold partially opens up, it will create flashing in the plastic product.
Electric
The electric press, also known as Electric Machine Technology (EMT), reduces operation costs by cutting energy consumption and also addresses some of the environmental concerns surrounding the hydraulic press. Electric presses have been shown to be quieter, faster, and have a higher accuracy, however the machines are more expensive.
Hybrid injection (sometimes referred to as "Servo-Hydraulic") molding machines claim to take advantage of the best features of both hydraulic and electric systems, but in actuality use almost the same amount of electricity to operate as an electric injection molding machine depending on the manufacturer.
A robotic arm is often used to remove the molded components; either by side or top entry, but it is more common for parts to drop out of the mold, through a chute and into a container.

St Margaret's Bay Windmill is a Grade II listed Smock mill on South Foreland, the southeasternmost point of England. It was built in 1929 to generate electricity for the attached house, high on the White Cliffs of Dover.
History
The mill was built for Sir William Bearswell by Holman's, the Canterbury millwrights. It was built to generate electricity and started generating in June 1929. The mill ceased to generate electricity in 1939, when the dynamo was removed. During the Second World War, the mill was occupied by a special branch of the WRNS. Repairs were done to the mill in 1969 by millwrights Vincent Pargeter and Philip Lennard. These included a new fantail and repairs to the sails.
Description
St Margaret's Bay Windmill is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. It has four patent sails and is winded by a fantail. The mill generated electricity via a dynamo and is now used as residential accommodation, a use it has always had.

19-Noretiocholanolone, also known as 5β-estran-3α-ol-17-one, is a metabolite of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and bolandione (19-norandrostenedione) that is formed by 5α-reductase. It is on the list of substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since it is a detectable metabolite of nandrolone, an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS).
Traces of 19-noretiocholanolone may be naturally present in human urine. Consumption of boar meat, liver, kidneys and heart have been found to increase urinary 19-noretiocholanolone output.

Radinovo (Bulgarian: Радиново, IPA: radˈinovɔ) is a village in Maritsa Municipality, Plovdiv Province, Southern Bulgarian. Its name is sometimes seen as Radenovo (Bulgarian: Радeново). As of 2006 the population is 720.
Geography
Radinovo is located in the Upper Thrace lowlands, 7 km. northwest of Plovdiv. It is 172 m. above sea level. The village's area is 1270.5 m2.
History
According to the local tradition, the village name derives from Radi (Bulgarian: Ради)—a young, unruly and brave Bulgarian—who lived in the time of Ottoman rule in Bulgaria. The village in which Radi lived the river Potoka and the modern village Voisil. The Turks kidnapped some of the prettiest girls in the village; at evening he gathered a dozen men, and together they slaughtered the Turks and freed the girls. In order to escape revenge, they ran in the thick forest; the Turks began to hunt for them so they could kill them, but could not find them. They discovered the location of Radi's house and burned it.
After this, Radi and the men settled at the place which today is Radinovo. However, this is against tradition. The historic information say otherwise, and according to it, Radinovo is an old village founded during the Middle Ages, and witnessed the Ottoman invasion. The earliest information about the village are recorded in the 1472 register, where the village is described as "Village Radin Ova Gereban" (Bulgarian: Село Радин Ова Геберан) a part of Filibe (nowadays Plovdiv). Information about the village under the names "Village Radnevo, falling towards Filibe" and "Village Radinova" of Filibe, in the entire—short—register of the Ottoman Empire of 1530.
Quotations from the Ottoman documents for the village of Radinovo from the 15th to 17th centuries:
Commemorative Plaque
A historical point of interest in the village is the commemorative plaque from 1981, in honor of 1300 years from the founding of Bulgaria. On the plaque, the names of the local soldiers who died in the Balkan wars in 1912-13, the First World War in 1914-1918, and the Second World War from 1944-1945.
Economy
Several plants are located close to the village.

Joan E. Biren or JEB (born July 13, 1944 in Washington, DC) is an American feminist photographer and film-maker, who dramatizes the lives of LGBT people in contexts that range from healthcare and hurricane relief to Womyn's Music and anti-racism. For portraits, she encourages sitters to act as her “muse”, rather than her “subject”. Biren was a member of The Furies Collective, a short-lived but influential lesbian commune.
Filmography
JEB's films include No Secret Anymore: The Times of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon; Removing the Barriers, used to train healthcare providers to improve service to lesbian clients; Women Organize!; and Solidarity, Not Charity on relief efforts in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. Additional notable films have included Lesbian Physicians on Practice, Patients and Power and For Love and For Life: The 1987 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. The first film is still commonly screened in medical schools around the country and the latter has been broadcast on public television.
Biren produced and wrote A Simple Matter of Justice, which documented the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. The one-hour film received wide acclaim and was voted "Best Video" at the Washington, DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. To produce this piece, Joan set up a live six-camera switch feed that simultaneously broadcast footage on jumbo screens located on the National Mall and around the world.
Early career: The Furies and photography
Joan attended Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she received her B.A. in political science in 1966. She later received a M.A. in Communication at American University in Washington, D.C. After three years of pursuing doctoral studies at Oxford University, Biren returned home to America. While working at a camera store and small town newspaper, Biren began to teach herself photography skills that laid the foundation for her future career.
In her early 20s, Biren and others, including Rita Mae Brown and Charlotte Bunch, formed the Furies Collective, a radical experiment in lesbian feminist separatist organizing. Though the collective lasted only about 18 months, it had a profound influence on lesbian thought through its newspaper, The Furies, and other publications.
It was in the collective that JEB began developing her skills in photography. As she has stated, "I needed to see images of lesbians." In the 1970s, Biren toured the United States, photographing lesbians at women's events ranging from the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, anti–Ku Klux Klan demonstrations, writing workshops, sporting events, lesbian-separatist communities, and gay and lesbian pride marches. “Wherever lesbians gathered, where I could take pictures, I would be there.” Beginning in 1979 JEB toured the country presenting her slide show "Lesbian Images in Photography, 1850 to the Present," also known as "The Dyke Show," to women-only audiences. Her books Eye to Eye: Portraits of Lesbians (1979) and Making a Way: Lesbians Out Front (1987) brought groundbreaking visibility to lesbian lives.
JEB's first ever book was titled Eye to Eye: Portraits of Lesbians (1979) and it was considered a revolutionary work for its era. The book showcased JEB's collection of photographs that she took of lesbians from different backgrounds and ages in the United States living their daily lives. Photographs that were included in her book were of lesbians in their homes embracing each other, raising a family together, and showing that they were in love. Alongside the photographs, JEB included their names and writings of their personal stories of their everyday lives.
JEB's vision for her book was to change the way society viewed lesbians and to allow lesbians to see themselves being represented in a book. The publication of her book helped with the revolution of the lesbian movement that was occurring in the 1970s and 1980s allowing her to travel to bookstores that sold her work and even universities that requested JEB to give presentations about her book and to describe her writing and filming process as a lesbian feminist photographer.
In 1997, George Washington University mounted a retrospective exhibit of JEB's work, Queerly Visible: 1971–1991, which later toured the nation.
In 2011, Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art held a retrospective show, "Lesbians Seeing Lesbians: Building Community in Early Feminist Photography".
Her mentors included Audre Lorde and Barbara Deming. She said, "I watched them, and I read what they wrote, and I translated it into visuals that I needed to share as widely as possible." In her photography, Joan tried to break away from the traditional power structures associated with photography. She preferred to use the term "muse" rather than "subject." She would also try to interact with her "muses" on equal terns. If she was photographing a nude woman, she would ask if the women wanted her to be nude as well.
In an effort to ensure that affirming images and positive self-expression occurred outside of what she considered traditional patriarchal venues, Biren included her work in off our backs, The Washington Blade, Gay Community News, and on many LP album and book covers.
Career
For many years, JEB traveled the country presenting her multi-projector slideshows and running photography workshops. In the early 1990s, she moved from slideshows to film making. JEB's award-winning films have been seen on the Sundance Channel and public broadcasting stations. She is the president of Moonforce Media, a non-profit company, which produces and distributes films and videos that challenge people to work for social justice and awards The Tee A. Corinne Prize, an annual grant to lesbian media makers.
JEB's papers and visual materials are permanently archived at The Sophia Smith Collection, the premiere women's history collection, at Smith College. Many of her photographs are located at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. In addition, The George Washington University houses a collection of photographs used in Queerly Visible: 1971–1991.
From Joan Biren's oral history in the Rainbow History Project collection:
In 1995, Biren became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

In August 1096, Hugh and his small army left France in prima profectione, the first army of the third wave to leave France, and travelled to Bari, Italy, and then crossed the Adriatic Sea to the Byzantine Empire, in an armada commanded by Arnout II, Count of Aarschot. When Hugh entered Constantinople, he carried a Vexillum sancti Petri, a banner given to him by the pope, Hugh being the last such noble to carry the banner.
The known nobles, clergy and knights of Hugh's army include:
Eudes of Beaugency, Hugh's Standard-Bearer and Seneschal

Elisa Berroeta Araya was a Chilean 20th-century engraver, illustrator, and visual artist. She is known as one of the first female artists awarded scholarships by the Chilean government for studies in Europe.
Biography
Elisa Berroeta–Araya was born in the late 19th-century in Ovalle, in Coquimbo, Chile. She studied engraving at the Academy of Painting (Santiago, Chile) (formerly Escuela de Bellas Artes de Santiago) under French artist León Bazin.
In 1905, Berroeta obtained a scholarship granted by the Chilean government to continue her artistic studies in Paris, where she lived and worked for three years. In that same year 1905, Chilean Zig Zag magazine named Berroeta, "a national artist (of Chile)" for her representation of her country abroad. From roughly the 1880s to 1920s, it was common for wood engravings to be used for fine-art reproduction and for illustration. In France she created many wood engraving reproductions of French art, some of which were published in Chilean Selecta magazine.
Berroeta participated in the annual salon, Exhibition of Fine Arts, Santiago () in 1904, 1906, and 1907. In 1904, she was awarded a third prize medal for her two engravings at the Exhibition of Fine Arts, Santiago.

The Roman Catholic cathedral of St. Joseph is one of the most important historical buildings in Stone Town, Zanzibar, as well as one of its main visitor attractions.
The church is regularly used by the local Catholic community, with several masses being held each Sunday and occasionally on weekdays.
Location
The church is located in the Baghani area, off Kenyatta road. While its twin spires are easily seen from a distance and from elevated places in Stone Town (i.e., the House of Wonders balconies), the church itself can prove hard to find in the maze of narrow streets of Baghani. The easiest route to the church is following Kenyatta Road to Gizenga Street and then taking the first street on the right.
History and style
The church was built by French missionaries between 1893 and 1898. The design of the church was based on that of the Marseille Cathedral, and in fact the two churches bear some resemblance to each other, the Stone Town cathedral being much smaller. Its main architectural feature is twin spires (like those of Marseille's church) that are one of the easiest elements of Stone Town's skyline to spot from elevated places as well as from the ocean. The interior is painted with scenes from the Old Testament, all of which have been destroyed due to the poorly done restoration in 2014. The tiles and stained glass windows were imported from France.
In the narrow churchyard there used to be a tall palm tree, which appears in most pictures of the church; the tree has been cut down sometimes in the 2000s.

The San Andres vireo or St. Andrew vireo (Vireo caribaeus) is a threatened species of vireo endemic to the Colombian island of San Andrés in the Caribbean, located off the east coast of Nicaragua. Due to habitat loss from the ever expanding population on these small islands, the species has now become limited to a few localities on the southern half of the island, but it is still common in some of these areas. It is found in most habitat types on the island.
Description
It is a small bird, 12.5 cm in length. It is olive-green above and whitish or pale yellow below. It has two white bars on the wing, pale edges to the flight-feathers and a pale yellow stripe between the bill and eye. The eye is grey-brown. It has several songs and calls, producing a one-syllable chattering, a repeated two-syllable song and a three-syllable song.
It is very similar to the mangrove vireo (V. pallens) and Jamaican vireo (V. modestus). It has a slightly thinner and darker bill than the mangrove vireo. Its bill is slightly longer and darker than that of the Jamaican vireo which also differs in having a whitish eye and fainter stripe between the bill and eye.
Distribution and habitat
It is restricted to the islands of St. Andrew (or San Andrés) and Providencia in the south-west Caribbean which belong to Colombia but is closer to Nicaragua. It occurs in a variety of habitats including woodland, cocoa plantations, scrubby pastures and mangrove swamps. It prefers vegetation with a dense understorey. It is most common in the less urbanized south of the island. The population has been estimated at between 8,200 and 14,000 individuals.
The bird has a very small range and may be vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes. It is threatened by habitat loss as the island's population increases. However, it is tolerant of habitat degradation and is still one of the island's commonest birds. It is classified as Vulnerable by BirdLife International.
Behaviour
It feeds by gleaning caterpillars and other arthropods from vegetation. The breeding territory covers about 0.5 hectares and nesting has been recorded in June. The nest is built on or hanging from a branch in bushes or mangroves. Two lightly spotted eggs are laid.

Paul Norman Hug (June 27, 1906 – September 5, 1949) was an American college football player and coach.
Early years
Hug played under LeRoy Sprankle at Kingsport High with Bobby Dodd. Both Hug and Dodd intended to attend Vanderbilt University but were pried away by Robert Neyland.
University of Tennessee
Hug was a prominent end for the Tennessee Volunteers football teams of the University of Tennessee from 1928 to 1930.
1928
In 1928, Tennessee remained undefeated on the season with a 6–0 victory over Vanderbilt; its first win in the series since 1916. Before 1928, Vanderbilt held a strong advantage over the Volunteers with a record of 18–2–3. Since 1928, Tennessee has dominated the rivalry. The crowd of 22,000 was the largest ever to see a game in Tennessee up to that point. A 16-yard pass from Roy Witt to Paul Hug in the second quarter was the lone score of the contest. He wore number 26 and weighed 172 pounds.
1929
Hug was selected All-Southern in 1929.
Coaching career
Hugh was an assistant at Southwestern University—now known as Rhodes College—and a head coach the University of Tennessee Junior College—now known as University of Tennessee at Martin. At the latter institution, he is the namesake of Hug Drive.

John Edward James (born 19 February 1934) is an English former professional footballer who made 130 appearances in the Football League playing for Birmingham City and Torquay United. He played as an inside forward.
James was born in Harborne, Birmingham. As a youngster he was on the books of Brighton & Hove Albion, but he was working in a brass foundry when Birmingham City signed him in as a junior in June 1950. He turned professional the following year, and made his first-team debut on 4 March 1953, replacing the injured Peter Murphy in a sixth-round FA Cup replay against Tottenham Hotspur which finished as a 2–2 draw. He played in the next three league games, scoring twice in the last of these to secure a 3–1 win against Barnsley, but managed only two first-team games in the next season and one the season after, and moved on to Torquay United at the end of the 1954–55 season. James spent six seasons with Torquay, and scored 11 goals from 125 league appearances.

Thornbury is a small township on the east bank of the lower Aparima River, in western Southland, New Zealand. It is approximately 10 km northeast of Riverton, and 31 km northwest of Invercargill. It is mainly a farming service community. Local small industries include machinery and transport/trucking companies, and a tannery.
The township was founded by pioneer settlers Matthew Instone and Robert Foster. It was named by Robert Foster after his wife's birthplace, the market town of Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, England.
Originally Thornbury had grown around a railway junction. The railway line from Invercargill split at Thornbury, with one branch going around the coast to Riverton and Tuatapere/Orawia, and the Wairio Branch going inland to the coal mines at Nightcaps. In 1978 the Tuatapere Branch was closed and was eventually removed.
Thornbury has one school for primary-age children, called Thornbury School . The school celebrated in 2008 its 125th anniversary, the original school having opened on June 6, 1883.

Messi (; born 30 October 2015) is a pet cougar, model and Internet celebrity, owned by Russian couple Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev. Messi was adopted in 2016 from a local petting zoo. They live with Messi in a two-storey house on a large plot of land in Penza, Russia. In 2017, the Dmitrievs started an Instagram account and a YouTube channel for Messi, which became very popular by 2018 and continues to grow in subscribers.
Early life
Messi was born in a zoo at Saransk, Russia. He was one of three newborn cougars at the zoo to be named after professional football players for currently Paris Saint-Germain and former FC Barcelona; Messi was named after Lionel Messi, and the other two were named Suarez and Neymar. The cubs were given these names because Saransk was one of several cities proposed to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Messi was later sold to a petting zoo in Penza when he was three months old.
Messi was significantly smaller than other typical male cougars, and as the species is not native to Russia, he could not be released into the wild. He had numerous other health problems as well, which deemed him unable to live in a zoo or wildlife sanctuary either. Furthermore, workers at the petting zoo originally planned to euthanize him.
In 2016, Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev visited the Penza zoo and met Messi for the first time. The couple experienced "love at first sight," and noticed Messi's exceptionally gentle personality. The Dmitrievs already had a sphynx cat named Kira but Aleksandr always wanted a big cat and so they considered bringing Messi home and offered a high price to the zoo authorities. “So we went to the zoo and started negotiations to buy Messi. We were surprised ourselves when they agreed", Mariya Dmitriev recalled in an interview with Caters News.
Domestic life
When they first purchased Messi, Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev lived in a small studio apartment in Penza. The hallway of the apartment was modified and was designated as Messi's play area. Messi uses toys such as empty bottles and balls. Messi has a gentle and calm personality, and has never attacked a person or another animal. The Dmitrievs sometimes refer to him as "kitten."
Messi is regarded by his owners as similar to a domestic dog. He has been trained at a local dog training facility and has learned around ten formal commands. The Dmitrievs walk Messi regularly using a leash, coat, and harness through various environments.
Messi is fed twice a day, and his diet mostly consists of raw turkey, beef, and chicken. It costs the Dmitrievs about 630 rubles per day to feed him. The couple regularly bathes Messi in a bathtub and sometimes trim his claws.
Messi is house-broken (trained) and prefers to stay inside when there is snow outside.
Media attention
In 2017, the Dmitrievs started an Instagram account and YouTube channel for Messi, both called "I_am_puma". Pictures and videos published to these social media accounts show various aspects of daily life with the cougar. Messi's social media accounts quickly grew in popularity; by January 2018, the Instagram account already had almost 150,000 followers and over 50 million views. The Instagram account has more than 1.5 million followers; the YouTube channel has more than 1.8 million subscribers. Mariya is the manager of the social media accounts.
Relations with other animals
Messi also shared the property and attention of the Dmitrievs with a 10-year-old female cheetah named Ichel, who was given to the Dmitrievs by a circus trainer in December 2019 and revealed in January 2020. Ichel died of lung cancer in April 2020.
The Dmitrievs own another female cheetah, named Gerda, who has a calm and gentle personality similar to Messi's. Messi becomes anxious when Gerda is present but relations between the two animals are improving. Gerda has her own YouTube channel, "I_am_cheetah".
The Dimitrievs also had another feline in their house, a female Sphinx cat (hairless breed) called Kira; she lived in the house with little interaction with Messi. In April 2021, Kira met Gerda, but became very anxious and avoided her enclosure afterwards. She died of a dilated cardiomyopathy later that month.
Criticism
Despite mostly favorable attention on social media, some have criticized the Dmitrievs for keeping Messi under domestic circumstances. Opposers of the taming of wild animals fear that Messi's wild needs will not be met, and that once Messi reaches sexual maturity (he has since passed that mark) he may become more prone to dangerous behavior. They advise the Dmitrievs to send Messi to a wildlife reserve or sanctuary. The Dmitrievs, however, believe that Messi would not be able to survive in a wild setting, not least of which being that he requires daily medication.

Daniel Barclay Williams (November 22, 1861 – July 27, 1895) was an American educator who worked at the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, making him the first Black teacher of classics in the state.
Early life
Daniel Barclay Williams was born on November 22, 1861, to a mother who the African American National Biography says was "apparently" single, in Richmond, Virginia. He graduated from Richmond Colored High and Normal School in 1877. While there, he was helped by Mary Elizabeth Knowles, the school's principal until 1876, and Ralza Morse Manly, who succeeded her, and earned a gold medal for "excellence in scholarship and conduct". He was a talented swimmer. Three years later he graduated from Worcester Academy. Williams attended Brown University, for a year in 1880. He may have left because of financial issues, and returned to Richmond. He continued to study while there.
Career
In 1881, Williams worked at the First Baptist Church Sabbath School as an assistant superintendent, a post he had left by 1882. Two years later he found a job teaching in the Henrico County Public Schools. Williams left that post to teach from March to June 1885 in Richmond at the Moore Street Industrial School. Later that year he was hired to teach classics, math, science and the "art of teaching" at the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute (later Virginia State University). He worked in that role until 1887, when he was made professor of ancient languages, a post he held until his death. From 1891 to 1895 he was the department's dean. Williams' work at the Virginia Institute made him the state's first Black classics teacher. He published works and used other books by Black authors, such as William Sanders Scarborough. The Rutgers University Database of Classical Scholars describes Williams as having been "a one-man department". He was also active in the Virginia Teachers Association, chairing its executive committee from 1889 to 1892 and serving as president in 1892.
He taught in the Navy Hill School in Richmond, Virginia, during the 1880s. Navy Hill was one of four schools in the city's segregated school system for Black children and the only to have any Black teachers.
He could read French, German, Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. Williams published The Negro Race: The Pioneers in Civilization (1883), a book arguing that Black civilizations in Africa had influenced the development of Greece and Rome and had been equally "civilized", as well as highlighting the successes of freed Black people in the United States after their emancipation. He was further published in The Industrial Herald and Richmond Planet and wrote several other books; he was also a devout Christian practicing biblical literalism. Williams' 1887 Science, Art, and Methods of Teaching later became a textbook. His book Freedom and Progress, originally published in 1890, went through several editions. These publications made Williams the first faculty member of the Virginia Institute to have written and published a book. Livingstone College awarded him an honorary MA in 1889, and Shaw University a PhD two years later.
Personal life
Williams was married and had one child.
He died on July 27, 1895, while getting an operation in Petersburg, Virginia. James H. Holmes oversaw his funeral. His papers are held in the Johnston Memorial Library of Virginia State University.

The Hotel Carter was a hotel located near Times Square in Manhattan, New York City. The building is 24 stories tall, and at its opening, had 1,000 rooms, but was later downsized to 700 rooms. Opened in 1930 as the Dixie Hotel, it originally extended from 43rd Street to 42nd Street, although the wing abutting 42nd Street has since been demolished. The hotel has changed ownership numerous times throughout its history. In October 1976, it was renamed the Hotel Carter in an attempt to rehabilitate its image. The hotel closed and was offered for sale in 2014.
While it was operating, the Hotel Carter gained a negative reputation due to the crimes that took place there, as well as its general uncleanliness. At least nine deaths occurred in the hotel, including four suicides and four murders. In addition, the Hotel Carter was cited as being among America's dirtiest hotels, both by the media and via visitor reviews.
History
Early years
The Dixie Hotel was financed by a $2.2 million loan to Harold and Percy Uris by the New York State Title and Mortgage Company in May 1929. Excavation for the new structure began with the removal of six old tenements from the site in May 1929. Tenements were razed between 250–263 West 43rd Street along with a two-story taxpayer at 241 West 42nd Street. Several floors of steel work were added to the framework by mid-October. It was chartered for $10,000 by M.C. Levine, of 535 Fifth Avenue, on April 22, 1930. When it opened, the Dixie Hotel contained a thousand rooms (later downsized to 700 rooms).
A bus depot in the Dixie Hotel was opened in February 1930. The terminal handled 350 buses daily during peak summer seasons. The Central Union Bus Terminal had the largest enclosed loading space of any bus terminal in New York. It occupied the main floor of the hotel and was managed separately. It had entrances on 42nd Street and 43rd Street. The loading platform and waiting room were situated five feet below street level. Buses entered and departed utilizing separate ramps. A bus turntable with a diameter of 35 feet was employed to direct incoming buses to exit. Bus movements were governed by a dispatcher using an electric signaling device. It was called the Short Line Bus Terminal by July 1931. Another business which was located in the hotel was Max Bachner's laundry. It was given a lease for operation in August 1929.
In October 1931 a Federal judge appointed the Irving Trust as receiver in the bankruptcy of the Harper Organization, Inc, and Harris H, and Percy Uris, its officers. The defendant corporation owned the Dixie Hotel. James B. Regan, formerly proprietor of The Knickerbocker Hotel, was another appointed receiver.
The hotel and bus terminal were sold in March 1932, during the Great Depression, to pay a debt of $2,058,540. The property was valued at $2.3 million. In April 1932 the Southworth Management Corporation, headed by Roy S. Hubbell, assumed control of hotel operations. Hubbell formerly managed the Hotel Commodore and the Hotel Belmont in New York City. The Southworth Management Corporation was affiliated with William Ziegler Jr. The company had jurisdiction over the site of the demolished Hotel Belmont at 42nd Street and Park Avenue. Hubbell, whose primary residence was in Pelham, New York, died in October 1932 in his bedroom at the Dixie Hotel at age 55. The Carter Hotels Corporation took over management of the business in 1942.
In April 1942 the Dixie Hotel experienced an increase in the number of executives and business couples who selected its quarters as permanent residences. Management responded by redecorating and preparing one-room units for accommodation as living rooms during the day and bedrooms at night. In July 1951, Jacobowitz & Katz, investors, purchased the taxpayer which adjoined the hotel, located at 264 West 43rd Street, in a deal brokered by Harry G. Silverstein.
Later years and decline
The bus terminal closed in 1957 because of low passenger counts compared to the Port Authority Bus Terminal at Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets.
The 255 seat Bert Wheeler Theater opened in the hotel, ten steps above its entrance, in October 1966. Autumn's Here, a musical comedy, was its first attraction. The theater was located in the hotel's Plantation Room. It measured 60 feet in length and 45 feet in width. It was formerly used as a nightclub and later as a restaurant. A circular bar, 50 feet in circumference, adjoined the theater, and was located behind glass doors. It was closed during performances, except for during a twenty-minute intermission. Food was served in the Terrace Room, the hotel's restaurant. In June 1967 Follies Burlesque '67 reopened at the Bert Wheeler Theater, after opening at Players Theater in Greenwich Village. The cast included Mickey Hargitay and Toni Karrol.
Through the mid-1970s, the hotel's restaurant was a daily gathering place for local and visiting professional and amateur magicians for lunch at the "Dixie Round Table" where they swapped tricks and stories. Famous regular visitors included Harry Blackstone Jr., Cardini, and many others. The Carter Theater in the Carter Hotel presented Aesop's Fables in 15 theatrical styles in November 1979. The play was produced by the Theater Workshop and the Broadway-Times Theater Company. The Off-Broadway musical Ka-Boom! debuted at the Carter Theater in November 1980.
In 1976 the company allocated $250,000 for renovations and sign alteration in an effort to "clean up" Times Square. H.B. Cantor, president of the company, wanted to change the hotel's name to give one of the establishments in the chain a corporate identity. The firm controlled four other hotels in Buffalo, New York and Boston. At this time, the Dixie Hotel was renamed the Hotel Carter. Vietnamese businessman and former shipowner Tran Dinh Truong purchased the hotel in October 1977. The Carter was described as an establishment which caters to "middle-class tourists [and] has suffered with the decline of the surrounding area."
In December 1983 the Carter Hotel was home to 190 families. That month it was cited for its "consistently low rate of compliance in correcting health and safety violations". The city sued the hotel in 1983 and 1984 for its failure to correct numerous infractions. In March 1985 Truong was found in contempt of court and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. New York City was using the hotel as a homeless shelter in June 1984. The hotel's 43rd Street entrance became a gathering place for teenagers and young children. By the end of 1985 the Carter had greatly reduced the number of homeless families staying in its rooms. The number of homeless families declined from 300 to 61. The city paid the Carter $62.62 to house a family in a small single room. In one instance the room was musty, with peeling wallpaper, and tattered carpet. The smell in the room was intense. The hotel began to make an effort to attract tourists once again. New York City removed all homeless families from the Carter in 1988 due to difficulties with plumbing, electricity, security, and vermin. In July 1990, the Penthouse Hostel operated with a lease on the 23rd and 24th floors of the Hotel Carter. The hostel sign was barely visible beneath the Carter marquee. Lodgings there provided an alternative to the American Youth Hostels organization.
In December 1998 the hotel was temporarily closed because an emergency fire exit was damaged.
Tran died in 2012, with his surviving family fighting over who got ownership of the hotel. GF Management took ownership of the hotel in April 2013, and the hotel was offered for sale in 2014 after an extensive renovation.
Incidents and issues
Crimes
Sidney Miller, a store clerk at the Dixie Hotel, was arrested for violating a New York state antismut law during a raid on Square Books, at 584 7th Avenue, in April 1966. His accomplice, Edward Mishkin, was previously convicted of publishing obscene material. His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in March 1966.
Darrell Bossett, an unemployed laborer, was arrested after a scuffle with police in a fourth-floor room of the Carter Hotel, in December 1980. He was charged with first degree murder and second degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon, in the shooting of New York City Police Department Officer Gabriel Vitale.
Deaths
At least nine deaths have occurred in the hotel, including four suicides and four murders. RoomSpook, a website that tracks unwanted events in hotels, lists at least five murders and five suicides in the hotel.
William Lindsay Gresham, author of the noir novel Nightmare Alley, discovering he had cancer of the tongue, checked himself into the hotel known as the Dixie Hotel during that time, and committed suicide in Room 2023 by taking an overdose of sleeping pills on September 14, 1962.
George R. Sanders of Brooklyn jumped from the 14th floor of the hotel on March 13, 1931. His body crashed through the roof of a single story restaurant adjacent to the Dixie. He landed at the feet of two customers and the night manager. He left a note in his room identifying himself and citing mental depression as the reason for killing himself.
Olga Kibrick, daughter of a wealthy Brockton, Massachusetts insurance executive, committed suicide by leaping from the roof of the hotel to a third-floor extension on the west side of the building, in October 1931. She had been staying on the 21st floor. Police found a Brockton Musical Chorus card in her room, along with 15 cents in change, her gloves, and a pocketbook.
The body of James M. Fairbanks, a former office manager of the brokerage firm of Tucker, Anthony, & Co., was discovered by hotel employees on the roof of a three-story extension, in April 1932. Fairbanks committed suicide to avoid being sentenced for embezzling $290,000 from his employers. He was staying in room 2002 the night before he was to have been sentenced for between five and 10 years for that offense.
In September 1941 a young man from Wayne, Nebraska burned to death after falling asleep smoking on the 12th floor of the hotel. The story made headlines when reporters discovered that shortly after his arrival he received a letter from his father. Fredereick S. Berry Jr. was warned by his parent of a premonition his mother had of something dire happening to him. Berry was discovered by hotel employees seated in a chair, with the clothing on his upper body burned completely. He died after being taken to Roosevelt Hospital.
A 25-day-old infant was beaten to death at the hotel in November 1983. Her father, Jack Joaquin Correa, a hotel resident, was charged with murder and child abuse.
In 1987, a woman was thrown to her death out of a window from one of the top floors after witnesses heard arguing from room 1604.
In July 1999, a clerk who lived at the hotel fatally stabbed and beat a co-worker during a brawl near the front desk.
On August 31, 2007, a housekeeper found the body of Kristine Yitref, wrapped in plastic garbage bags and hidden under a bed in Room 608. Sex offender Clarence Dean was charged with homicide. Yitref, as Mistress Kris, was formerly a member of the goth rock group The Nuns. She had turned to prostitution at the time of her death to support a drug addiction.
Sanitary issues
On July 22, 2009 the Glenn Beck Program highlighted the reports of the filth and disrepair of the Carter Hotel. Beck covered the reviews that list over 500 very negative reviews. The Bed Bug Registry has listed many reports over several years citing former visitors' experiences with the hotel: Everything from mice and cockroaches to bed bug attacks. In 2011, TripAdvisor.com had Hotel Carter listed as no. 4 on their Top 10 of America's dirtiest hotels, based on reviews and user ratings. The hotel was also mentioned in the USA Today in relation to "winning" the title as the dirtiest hotel in the US in 2009.
In 2013–2014, GF Management made gradual modifications to the Hotel Carter in order to make it more desirable for guests, including increasing the frequency of housekeeping services from every 3 days to every other day; renovating 30 fourth-floor rooms; and replacing mattresses in rooms with reports of bedbugs. Prior to the improvements, the new owners recalled broken elevators; 40-year-old fire extinguishers; unlit emergency exit signs; no weekend doormen; "discarded hospital linens" atop beds; inadequate insurance; and overdue loans, according to The New York Times. As a result of these improvements, the hotel's satisfaction rating rose from 67.6% in 2012 to 73.7% in 2014.

Sir David de Brechin (died 1320) was a Scottish knight who fought on both sides during the Wars of Scottish Independence.
Life
He was the son of Sir William de Brechin by Elena Comyn, daughter of Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan and Elizabeth de Quincy. Sir William was the son of Henry, an illegitimate son of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon. Brechin is first attested to as a ward of a Sir John de Callendar in 1292.
Brechin fought in the Earl of Surrey's army at the Battle of Dunbar, and was granted lands previously owned by Alan Durward.
He names appears twice on the 1296 Ragman Rolls for Forfarshire.
In the train of Robert the Bruce, he was present at Peebles when the Bruce, John Comyn, and William Lamberton were sworn in as Guardians of Scotland. Brechin returned to Galloway with Bruce.
By 1301, Sir David was still active in southwestern Scotland. On 8 September Brechin was in a force led by Sir John de Soulis and Sir Ingram de Umfraville, that attacked Lochmaben Castle, and was wounded in the fight.
Brechin returned to English service when he did homage to Edward I of England at the Siege of Stirling Castle.
Continuing in English service, Brechin was present at the Battle of Inverurie, and according to John Barbour, he retired after the battle to Brechin Castle where he was besieged by David Earl of Atholl. However this is contested by the historian and genealogist Sir James Balfour Paul. According to all records, Strathbogie was still in the service of the English, so the capture of Brechin Castle must have been accomplished by another of King Robert's following.
On 6 April 1320, Brechin appended his seal to the Declaration of Arbroath.
At a parliament at Scone (later known as the Black Parliament) in August that year, Brechin was found complicit along with William de Soules, the Countess of Strathearn and others in a conspiracy to depose the king. For this offence Brechin was executed.
Although there is no reason to doubt his guilt, his execution surprised many people, as he was seen as a "flower of chivalry", having acquitted himself well in battle against the Saracens during the crusades.
Marriages and issue
Brechin appears to have married Margaret de Bonkyll, widow of Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll, by 1304 when she is recorded as his wife. and had issue.
Margaret de Brechin, married in 1315 to Sir David de Barclay
David de Brechin appears to have married secondly a Margaret Ramsay.

Depth of Field is the sixth studio album by ARIA award-winning Australian singer-songwriter Sarah Blasko. The album was released in Australia on 23 February 2018 through EMI.
Reception
Everett True from The Guardian gave the album 5/5 saying "The songs on Blasko's sixth album feel possessed of a dark undercurrent, the sort of edge that comes around after you have spent one too many late-night hours waiting for your partner to return home from carousing." adding "These are as great as any Australian pop I have heard, from Kylie Minogue to The Easybeats."
Dan Condon said "Depth of Field is an intimate look at the darkness that pervades modern relationships [and it's] proof that Blasko is still pushing into new and exciting creative corners."

Johnny Cisneros (born February 5, 1980) is an American mixed martial artist currently competing in the welterweight division of Bellator MMA. A professional competitor since 2010, he has also competed for King of the Cage.
Mixed martial arts career
Early career
Cisneros began his professional MMA career in 2010. He compiled an 8–2 record, competing for promotions such as King of the Cage and Gladiator Challenge, before beginning his stint in Bellator MMA.
Bellator MMA
In a Catchweight bout, Cisneros lost to Mikkel Parlo in his promotional debut at Bellator 115 on April 4, 2014, via unanimous decision. Parlo was able to control Cisneros on ground en route to a decision.
In another Catchweight affair and his second bout for the promotion, Cisneros was defeated by Ricky Rainey via first-round TKO on October 3, 2014, at Bellator 127. Rainey landed a knee to the head, hurting Cisneros and knocking him down, before subsequent hammer fists prompted a stoppage by the referee.
Cisneros defeated Gabriel Miglioli via a unanimous verdict, on August 28, 2015, at Bellator 141, thus, recording his first victory inside the promotion.
Cisneros faced Andy Murad at Bellator 160 on August 26, 2016. He lost the fight by unanimous decision.
Cisneros next faced Curtis Millender at Bellator 170 on January 21, 2017. He lost the fight via TKO in the second round.
Cisneros faced Marlen Magee at Bellator 192 on January 20, 2018. He won the fight via submission in the second round.
Cisneros faced Dave Terrel on November 24, 2018 at Golden Boy Promotions: Liddell vs. Ortiz 3. He won the bout via unanimous decision.
Cisneros faced John Mercurio on March 29, 2019 at Bellator 219. He lost the bout via majority decision.
Cisneros faced Mike Jasper on September 28, 2019 at Bellator 228. He won the bout in the second round after Jasper was unable to continue fighting due to an ankle injury.
Cisneros faced Joshua Jones on July 31, 2021 at Bellator 263. He lost the bout via ground and pound in the second round.
Personal life
Heavily-tattooed, Cisneros received his first tattoo at age 16.

Widescreen images are displayed within a set of aspect ratios (relationship of image width to height) used in film, television and computer screens. In film, a widescreen film is any film image with a width-to-height aspect ratio greater than the standard 1.37:1 Academy aspect ratio provided by 35 mm film.
For television, the original screen ratio for broadcasts was in fullscreen 4:3 (1.33:1). Largely between the 1990s and early 2000s, at varying paces in different nations, 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen TV displays came into increasingly common use. They are typically used in conjunction with high-definition television (HDTV) receivers, or Standard-Definition (SD) DVD players and other digital television sources.
With computer displays, aspect ratios wider than 4:3 are also referred to as widescreen. Widescreen computer displays were previously made in a 16:10 aspect ratio (e.g. 1680 × 1050), but now are usually 16:9 (e.g. 1920 × 1080).
Film
History
Widescreen was first used for The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (1897). This was not only the longest film that had been released to date at 100 minutes, but also the first widescreen film being shot on 63 mm Eastman stock with five perforations per frame.
Widescreen was first widely used in the late 1920s in some short films and newsreels, and feature films, notably Abel Gance's film Napoleon (1927) with a final widescreen sequence in what Gance called Polyvision. Claude Autant-Lara released a film Pour construire un feu (To Build a Fire, 1928) in the early Henri Chrétien widescreen process, later adapted by Twentieth Century-Fox for CinemaScope in 1952.
The experimental Natural Vision widescreen process developed by George K. Spoor and P. John Berggren used 63.5 mm film and had a 2:1 aspect ratio. In 1926, a Natural Vision film of Niagara Falls was released. In 1927, the Natural Vision process was used in the production of The American The Flag Maker. It was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and starred Bessie Love and Charles Ray, but was never released theatrically.
On May 26, 1929, Fox Film Corporation released Fox Grandeur News and Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 in New York City in the Fox Grandeur process. Other films shot in widescreen were the musical Happy Days (1929) which premiered at the Roxy Theater, New York City, on February 13, 1930, starring Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell and a 12-year-old Betty Grable as a chorus girl; Song o' My Heart, a musical feature starring Irish tenor John McCormack and directed by Frank Borzage (Seventh Heaven, A Farewell to Arms), which was shipped from the labs on March 17, 1930, but never released and may no longer survive, according to film historian Miles Kreuger (the 35 mm version, however, debuted in New York on March 11, 1930); and the western The Big Trail (1930) starring John Wayne and Tyrone Power, Sr. which premiered at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on October 2, 1930, all of which were also made in the 70 mm Fox Grandeur process.
RKO Radio Pictures released Danger Lights with Jean Arthur, Louis Wolheim, and Robert Armstrong on August 21, 1930 in a 65 mm widescreen process known as NaturalVision, invented by film pioneer George K. Spoor. On November 13, 1930, United Artists released The Bat Whispers directed by Roland West in a 70 mm widescreen process known as Magnafilm. Warner Brothers released Song of the Flame and Kismet (both 1930) in a widescreen process they called Vitascope.
In 1930, after experimenting with the system called Fantom Screen for The Trail of '98 (1928), MGM came out with a system called Realife. MGM filmed The Great Meadow (1930) in Realife. However, it is unclear whether it was released in that widescreen process due to declining interest of the movie-going public.
By 1932, the Great Depression had forced studios to cut back on needless expense and it was not until 1953 that wider aspect ratios were again used in an attempt to stop the fall in attendance due, partially, to the emergence of television in the U.S. However, a few producers and directors, among them Alfred Hitchcock, were reluctant to use the anamorphic widescreen size featured in such formats as Cinemascope. Hitchcock used VistaVision, a non-anamorphic widescreen process developed by Paramount Pictures and Technicolor which could be adjusted to present various flat aspect ratios.
Types
Masked (or flat) widescreen was introduced in April 1953. The negative is shot exposing the Academy ratio using spherical lenses, but the top and bottom of the picture are hidden or masked off by a metal aperture plate, cut to specifications of the theater's screen, in the projector. Alternatively, a hard matte in the printing or shooting stages may be used to mask off those areas while filming for composition purposes, but an aperture plate is still used to block off the appropriate areas in the theater. A detriment is that the film grain size is thus increased because only part of the image is being expanded to full height. Films are designed to be shown in cinemas in masked widescreen format but the full unmasked frame is sometimes used for television, known as an open matte. In such an instance, a photographer will compose for widescreen, but "protect" the full image from things such as microphones and other filming equipment. Standardized "flat wide screen" ratios are 1.66:1, 1.75:1, 1.85:1, and 2:1. 1.85:1 has become the predominant aspect ratio for the format.
35 mm anamorphic – This type of widescreen is used for CinemaScope, Panavision, and several other equivalent processes. The film is essentially shot "squeezed", so that the actors appear vertically elongated on the actual film. A special lens inside the projector unsqueezes the image so that it will appear normal. Films shot in CinemaScope or Panavision are usually projected at a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, though the historical aspect ratio can be 2.55:1 (original 4-track magnetic sound aspect ratio) or 2.35:1 (original mono optical sound aspect ratio). The negative is usually 2.66:1 or, in rare cases, 2.55:1 or 2.35:1. The sole purpose of the change to 2.39:1 and, later, to 2.40:1, was to better hide so-called "negative assembly" splices (splices employed in the composited camera negative. This was not a production change, rather it was a recommended projection change.)
A Chilean film, Post Mortem, used anamorphic lenses with 16 mm film, to be projected at an ultra-widescreen 2.66:1 for a unique look.
Super gauges – The full negative frame, including the area traditionally reserved for the sound track, is filmed using a wider gate. The print is then shrunk and/or cropped in order to fit it back onto release prints. The aspect ratio for Super 35, for example, can be set to virtually any projection standard.
Large gauge – A 70 mm film frame is not only twice as wide as a standard frame but also has greater height. Shooting and projecting a film in 70 mm therefore gives more than four times the image area of non-anamorphic 35 mm film providing a major improvement in image quality. Few major dramatic narrative films have been filmed entirely on this format since the 1970s; the three most recent are Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master and Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. For many years, large budget pictures shot anamorphically used reserve stocks of 70 mm film for SFX shots involving CGI or blue-screen compositing as the anamorphic format creates problems with said effects. It has also been used to sometimes strike 70 mm blow-up prints for "roadshow" tours in select cities from the 35 mm camera negative in order to capitalize on the extra sound channels provided. The introduction of digital sound systems and diminishing number of installed 70 mm projectors has made a 70 mm release largely obsolete. However, blowups from 35 mm formats to IMAX have been used for a limited number of blockbuster films.
Paramount's VistaVision was a larger gauge precursor to 70 mm film. Introduced in 1954, it ran standard 35 mm film through the camera horizontally to achieve a widescreen effect using greater negative area, in order to create a finer-grained four-perforation 35 mm prints in an era where standard monopack stock could not produce finer results. Negative frames were eight perforations wide. Eight-perf photography is sometimes used for shooting special effects in order to produce a finer grained matte that can be used in optical printing without image degradation, and is notable for its use in Lucasfilm's original three-Star Wars films, among others. Another similar system with horizontal orientation was MGM's Arnoldscope.
Multiple lens camera/multiple projectors – The Cinerama system originally involved shooting with three lens camerae, and projecting the three resulting films on a curved screen with three synchronized projectors, resulting in an ultrawide aspect ratio of 2.89. Later Cinerama movies were shot in 70 mm anamorphic (see below), and the resultant widescreen image was divided into three by optical printers to produce the final threefold prints.
The technical drawbacks of Cinerama are discussed in its own article. Only two narrative feature films, The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm and How the West Was Won, were filmed in three-camera Cinerama, and several sequences from the latter were actually filmed in Ultra-Panavision. With the exception of a few films created sporadically for use in specialty Cinerama theaters, the format is effectively obsolete.
A non-Cinerama, three-projector process was pioneered for the final reel of Abel Gance's epic film Napoléon (1927)
The process, called Polyvision by Gance, consisted of three 1.33 images side by side, so that the total aspect ratio of the image is 4:1. The technical difficulties in mounting a full screening of the film, however, make most theaters unwilling or unable to show it in this format.
Between 1956 and 1957, the Soviets developed Kinopanorama, which is identical in most respects to the original three-camera Cinerama.
Anamorphic 70 mm – 70 mm with anamorphic lenses, popularly known as "Ultra Panavision" or "MGM Camera 65", creates an even wider high-quality picture. This camera process was used for the remake of Ben-Hur (1959), resulting in an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, one of the widest projected images ever used for a feature film. 70 mm anamorphic was not commonly used, due to the very high production costs, although it was favored for epic films such as Ben-Hur in order to capture wide panoramic landscapes and high-budget scenes with thousands of extras and enormous sets. This system is obsolete.
Television
The original screen ratio for television broadcasts was 4:3 (1.33:1). This was the same aspect ratio as most cinema screens and films at the time television was first sold commercially. Earlier 4:3 films such as Gone with the Wind have always been displayed on television in full frame, though color television was invented later.
When preparing a film that was originally intended to be displayed in widescreen for television broadcast the material was often edited with the sides truncated, using techniques such as Center cut or pan and scan. Sometimes, in the case of Super 35, the full film negative was shown unmasked on TV (i.e. with the hard matte removed), however this causes the 4:3 image not to be what the director intended the audience to see, and sometimes boom mics, edited out of the shot when the picture is matted, can be visible. Modern widescreen televisions feature a 16:9 (and occasionally 16:10) aspect ratio, allowing them to display a 16:9 widescreen picture without letterboxing (or with a minimal letterbox in the case of 16:10).
The first widescreen TV sold in the United States was the Thomson Consumer Electronics RCA CinemaScreen, sold in 1993.
In Europe, the PAL TV format, with its higher resolution than NTSC format, meant the quality issues of letterboxed or matted movies on TV was not as severe. There is also an extension to PAL, called PALplus, which allows specially equipped receivers to receive a PAL picture as true 16:9 with a full 576 lines of vertical resolution, provided the station employs the same system. Standard PAL receivers will receive such a broadcast as a 16:9 image letterboxed to 4:3, with a small amount of color noise in the black bars; this "noise" is actually the additional lines which are hidden inside the color signal. This system has no equivalent in analog NTSC broadcasting.
Despite the existence of PALplus and support for widescreen in the DVB-based digital satellite, terrestrial and cable broadcasts in use across Europe, only Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Germany, the Nordic countries and the UK have adopted widescreen on a large scale, with over half of all widescreen channels available by satellite in Europe targeting those areas. The UK, in particular, began moving to widescreen with the advent of digital terrestrial television in the late 1990s, and commercials were required to be delivered to broadcasters in widescreen as of 1 July 2000, on their widescreen "C-Day".
Widescreen televisions are typically used in conjunction with Digital, High-Definition Television (HDTV) receivers, or Standard-Definition (SD) DVD players and other digital television sources. Digital material is provided to widescreen TVs either in high-definition format, which is natively 16:9 (1.78:1), or as an anamorphically-compressed standard-definition picture. Typically, devices decoding Digital Standard-Definition pictures can be programmed to provide anamorphic widescreen formatting, for 16:9 sets, and formatting for 4:3 sets. Pan-and-scan mode can be used on 4:3 if the producers of the material have included the necessary panning data; if this data is absent, letterboxing or centre cut-out is used.
HD DVD and Blu-ray players were introduced in 2006. Toshiba ceased production of HD DVD players in early 2008. Consumer camcorders are also available in the HD-video format at fairly low prices. These developments will result in more options for viewing widescreen images on television monitors.

Richard M. Ketchum (1922–2012) was an American historian and magazine editor. Historian Douglas Brinkley has said that Ketchum was "the finest historian of the American Revolution."
Early life
Ketchum was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on March 15, 1922, to George and Thelma Patton Ketchum. He graduated from Yale College in 1943 with a degree in American history. During World War II, Ketchum served as commander of a Navy submarine chaser in the Atlantic.
Career
Ketchum owned an advertising agency until 1951 and worked at the U. S. Information Agency.
Ketchum worked for the American Heritage Publishing Company from 1956 until 1974. He wrote 33 articles for American Heritage Magazine.
In 1974, Ketchum moved to Shelburne, Vermont, where he co-founded Country Journal, a magazine that "offered a blend of the bucolic and the practical, particularly to city folk who had opted for the rural life," according to The New York Times. The magazine was popular, reaching a circulation of 300,000. It was sold in 1984.
Ketchum was the author of numerous books. The Borrowed Years, 1938–1941 (1989) described the events leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Ketchum was particularly interested in the American Revolution. His last book, Victory at Yorktown: The Campaign That Won the Revolution was an account of the battle and unlikely triumph that led to American independence.

Meeting at the Milestone (Møte ved Milepelen ) by Sigurd Hoel was first published in 1947 by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag. It is considered one of the most significant books of Norwegian literature of the Occupation. It was immediately translated into several other languages.
In 1947 the great treason trials were still going on. The legal system considered the actions of individuals and admonished suitable punishment for those actions considered as treason. Many felt that the trials needed to investigate deeper. They should consider not only what the
traitors had done during the war. They should also investigate why Nazism appealed to some and not to others. Meeting at the Milestone came as an important contribution in this debate.
The goal of the novel was to show how each individual was responsible for Nazism and also towards other people. The theme of the novel is therefore guilt and responsibility.
The novel is written in first person. Everything is seen from the perspective of the narrator. The narrative is about the actions of the main character as well as his thoughts and reflections. The only name used for the "I" is the nickname "The spotless one".
Synopsis
The novel starts with a short and mysterious prologue, Frontkjemperen (The eastern front volunteer), allegedly written in 1947. The narrator talks about "I", "he" who got eight years, "his father" who committed suicide, and "her" who "I" have not spoken with since 1945. Even though this is the fate of strangers, "I" will organise some personal notes.
The first part of the book is written immediately after this, still in 1947. It talks about the time before 1943 when "I" wrote the second part of the book. He talks about the house that he has bought after lengthy negotiations with the master builder. He lost his family early during the occupation, and he was also imprisoned for a couple of weeks. By the resistance he was called "The spotless one", a nickname he quite appreciated. The leader of the resistance decided that his house was suitable for hiding people who needed to go into hiding.
One day in 1943 a man named Indregaard came to the house. The spotless one knew of him already. Indregaard was depressed and needed to talk about his problems with The spotless one. The conversation soon got to a common acquaintance, Hans Berg, who was a Nazi. Indregaard thought that because of what happened in their youth he was responsible for Hans Berg's Nazism.
The spotless one now starts writing about Hans Berg in order to find out why some people turn to Nazism. This part, which is written in 1943, starts with an analysis of Hans Berg's childhood and youth. The spotless one fails at his analysis. He then tries to analyse others of his fellow students who became Nazis, amongst them Carl Heidenreich, simply and superficially. Again he fails. It becomes evident that it is his own past he wants to analyse.
He describes his childhood, his father, his time as a student in Kristiania, and his first erotic experiences. After a couple of brief relationships he meets "Kari". He stops mid-sentence as he reveals that "Kari" fell pregnant.
The third part is written in Sweden in 1944. The spotless one had to flee after an assignment in the southern part of the country. He was assigned with tracing an informant in a small town. The informant turned out to be his own son by "Kari". She was married to Carl Heidenreich, and her real name was Maria. The spotless one let himself get captured by the Nazis, and was interrogated by Heidenreich. After the torture, or redemption, he experienced a 'vision' where he saw it all. He was rescued by Kari/Maria. He realised during the escape that he was responsible for the downfall of his family.
The final part of the novel is written in 1947. The spotless one visited Maria when he came back to Norway. He was told that Carl Heidenreich had committed suicide, and that his son, Karsten, had been arrested. Finally he describes fragments of his 'vision'.

The Sage is a forthcoming indoor arena and conference centre in Gateshead, United Kingdom due to open in Autumn 2024. The site is located between the existing Sage Gateshead venue and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art on the Gateshead Quayside.
The arena is being built to replace the nearby 11,000 capacity Utilita Arena Newcastle that was originally opened in 1995.
Name and history
The venue is named for The Sage Group, a British multinational enterprise software company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, who agreed a £10 million deal for the naming rights. As of 2022 the Sage Group are currently patrons of the next-door Sage Gateshead venue which announced that they will be finding a new name for the 2004 building.
Gateshead Council announced plans to redevelop the vacant site in 2014 and at that time the aim was for a mixed use development. The development is likely to cost £300 million. Preparatory works on the site began in late 2021.
HOK are the architects of the complex and it is a joint venture between developer Ask Real Estate and investment manager Patrizia AG. The complex will be operated by ASM Global who currently operate the nearby Utilita Arena Newcastle.
Facilities
The site will have two hotels run by the Accor group, an ibis and Novotel, with a total of over 300 rooms.
The Sage Arena will have a capacity of 12,500 and will also have outdoor performance spaces, bars, restaurants and retail outlets. The conference and event space will include 17 conference suites and of adaptable meeting space.

The Z-Mill or Sendzimir Mill is a machine for rolling steel. Unlike a traditional rolling mill this 20-high cluster mill configuration utilizes cascaded supporting rolls to apply force on the small work rolls in the center. This allows the application of a higher roll pressure without bending the work rolls, which would result in poor metal quality. Thus very hard and elastic materials can be rolled.
An early version of a Sendzimir Mill, one with fewer back-up rollers, was installed in the Old Park Silver Mills in Sheffield, England. Its primary function was to roll sheet nickel silver for the city's renowned cutlery and flatware trades. The installation was frequently cited in the Metallurgy degree course at Sheffield University. The Old Park Mills held a key place in the Industrial Revolution. They were originally laid down by Joseph Hancock in 1762-65 to produce Old Sheffield Plate - a thinner layer of silver fused onto thicker copper was then rolled into sheets - for the emerging Sheffield silverware industry. As such, the factory was probably one of the first in the world solely producing a semi-manufacture for other businesses. The original Old Sheffield Plate, now much sought-after by collectors, lasted for almost a century until it was superseded by electroplate technology in the mid-nineteenth century. Then the Old Park business switched to rolling nickel silver which, after manufacture, was electroplated.
Details of the Old Park Silver Mills and the silverware industry are explained in Mary Walton's book "Sheffield : its Story and its Achievements", pp116-120. Although the book was published in 1948 by the "Sheffield Telegraph" it remains in indispensable source on the city's history.
Development
The evolution to the current 20-High Cluster Sendzimir Mill from the early 12-High configuration was pioneered by Tadeusz Sendzimir in the early 1930s. The designs for the Sendzimir Mill were patented

John Patrick McVitty (December 26, 1926 – April 21, 1956) was an American stock car racing driver who competed in the NASCAR Grand National Series. He was born in Mamaroneck, New York.
During his two-year NASCAR career, McVitty had raced in eleven races with three finished in the top ten and 1382 laps of experience – the equivalent of . McVitty's total earning were considered to be $800 ($ when adjusted for inflation). His average start was in 18th place and his average finish was in 15th place. All of McVitty's races were done in Chevrolet vehicles. At the 1956 Wilkes County 160, a fuel pump problem caused McVitty to retire from the race; he would be killed in a racing accident thirteen days later at Langhorne Speedway.

The Olympic Symphonium is a Canadian indie folk trio from Fredericton, New Brunswick. The band consists of Nick Cobham (guitar), Kyle Cunjak (bass, guitar), and Graeme Walker (guitar, bass). All three musicians swap instruments and take turns singing and songwriting, and are often joined by Dennis Goodwin (lap steel, guitar, banjo) and Bob Deveau (drums).
History
The band was formed in 2005 when Walker who had written songs that didn't fit the style of his primary band, Grand Theft Bus, invited Cunjak and Cobham, two friends who had also written a number of songs that didn't fit their other bands, to join a new side project.
They released their debut album, Chapter One, in 2007, and sold out of the limited pressings while playing various shows around Atlantic Canada and Quebec. They followed it up with 2008's More in Sorrow Than In Anger, an album that included collaboration with a number of Canadian artists including Catherine MacLellan, Dale Murray, Jenn Grant, Amelia Curran, Joel Leblanc (Hot Toddy) and Rose Cousins. They toured in North America, and twice in the UK, stopping to record a session at the BBC with Bob Harris.
They recorded The City Won't Have Time to Fight in 2011 in an abandoned house in Fredericton. To mark the album's release, they organized a weekend music event, Shivering Songs, which featured performances by a variety of the band's friends and collaborators, including Rose Cousins, Catherine MacLellan, David Myles, Snailhouse, Olenka Krakus and Grant Lawrence.
In late 2012 they recorded Chance To Fate in the Salty Towers Inn in seaside St. Andrews, New Brunswick. This album marked the first time the band hired an outside producer, Joshua Van Tassel. It won 'Recording of the Year' at the 2014 Music New Brunswick awards and was nominated for an East Coast Music Award in 2015. In between, the band performed around North America, including the Atlin Arts & Music Festival outside of Whitehorse and a Stompin' Tom Tribute Concert in Toronto.
In 2018 the band recorded their fifth album, Beauty in the Tension, at The Old Confidence Lodge, a converted Oddfellows Lodge in Riverport, Nova Scotia, and have been performing Neil Young cover sets. The band performed at the Halifax Urban Folk Festival, and was nominated as Folk Artist of the Year at the Music New Brunswick awards.

Leichhardt Tree is a heritage-listed blazed tree at Yaldwyn Street, Taroom, Shire of Banana, Queensland, Australia. The blaze was made in 1844 by Ludwig Leichhardt. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.
History
The Leichhardt Tree in Taroom, in the upper Dawson River district, is named for its association with the explorer Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichhardt, who is thought to have blazed this tree during his expedition north from the Darling Downs to Port Essington (Darwin) in the Northern Territory in 1844-1846.
Leichhardt, born in Prussia in 1813, was a student of philosophy, languages and natural sciences. He journeyed to Sydney in 1841-1842 with the expressed intention of exploring the interior of Australia, and studied the geology and botany of the Sydney district before undertaking exploratory journeys between Newcastle and the Moreton Bay district in 1843-44. By mid-1844 Leichhardt was hoping to join a planned official New South Wales Government expedition from Sydney to Port Essington, but impatient with government delay and uncertain as to whether such an expensive expedition would be given official approval, Leichhardt mounted his own expedition, funded by squatter subscriptions.
Leichhardt and 5 volunteers sailed from Sydney for Moreton Bay, where they were joined by 2 more men, and by another 2 on the Darling Downs. The party left Jimbour Station, on the edge of the settled district of the northern Darling Downs, on 1 October 1844. By early November they had reached Juandah (now Wandoan), where Leichhardt decided to reduce the party by two, these men returning to Jimbour. Continuing north, Leichhardt reached the Dawson River (named by Leichhardt in honour of a Hunter Valley settler), crossing it where the town of Taroom now stands. Of the Dawson Valley, John Gilbert, a naturalist in Leichhardt's party, wrote:
"One of the most beautifully picturesque and extensive scenes met our anxious gaze. The immediate vicinity of the hills was like park scenery - clear undulating hills, with here and there small clumps of brigalo [sic], while the sides of many of the hills were dotted with single scrubs, as if picked out by hand. Beyond this to the westward, and round as far as we could see to the E.S.E was a carpet of evergreens for six or seven miles and then the high ranges rose up and formed a beautiful background to the most pleasing natural picture we have seen."
It is thought that Leichhardt camped on the southern side of the upper Dawson, where Pemberton Hodgson, tracing Leichhardt's track in mid-1845, found 3 large gum trees blazed with the letter "L". The coolibah surviving in Yaldwyn Street, Taroom - with the blaze LL.1844 once visible - may have been one of these trees. In 1916 one L and part of the year 1844 was still discernible, but bark had grown over part of the date and the second L. In the mid-1970s the blaze was just discernible although unreadable, but it is no longer visible.
Leichhardt crossed the Dawson River and stayed at Palm Tree Creek for several days before continuing westwards to Robinson's Creek, then crossed the Ruined Castle Creek area and the Expedition Range to the northwest. In late June 1845, John Gilbert was killed in an attack on the camp by Aborigines, but the remainder of the party survived and reached Port Essington, near Darwin, on 17 December 1845, completing an overland journey of nearly . They returned to Sydney by ship in March 1846.
Leichhardt's journey, and the explorations of Pemberton Hodgson in 1845, did much to open the way to further non-indigenous settlement in southeastern Queensland. Even before Leichhardt's journal of the expedition was published in 1847, word had spread of the rich pastures of the Dawson River district, encouraging squatters such the Archer brothers (1850) to explore the area more closely. By November 1845, Taroom Station had been taken up, and by the time the Leichhardt pastoral district of was proclaimed in 1854, most of the country had been taken up for pastoral purposes. The township of Taroom developed at the Dawson River crossing at the junction of several squatter tracks - one south to Juandah and crossing the Fitzroy - Murray-Darling watershed to the Darling Downs, one through the Auburn Range to Gayndah, and one southwest to Roma, and developed slowly as a staging post between Roma and Rockhampton. A post office was established at Taroom in 1853, a courtroom gazetted there in 1857, and the town was officially surveyed in 1860.
At least two other blazes have been marked on the Leichhardt Tree. In 1893 the Dawson River flooded, reaching to the base of the Leichhardt Tree in Taroom. This level was marked on the tree, but is no longer visible; also a surveyor's blaze had been marked on the tree by August 1916. In 1925 the Irrigation and Water Supply Department surveyed the area for a proposed dam site, at which point another blaze supposedly was inscribed on the tree - again no longer visible.
By the mid-1970s, the tree had been heavily lopped and was suffering severe insect damage. In 1979 several cavities caused by previous lopping and breakage were plugged and sealed to prevent further rotting, and the tree has successfully regenerated.
On 23 October 1988, a monument was erected by the local historical society and tourism association to celebrate the Bicentenary of Australia and Leichhardt's 175th birthday.
Description
The town of Taroom is located where the Leichhardt Highway crosses the Dawson River, and the Leichhardt Tree is located about up a steadily inclining slope from the bed of the Dawson River, on the west side of Yaldwyn Street reserve in Taroom, between Dawson and Kelman Streets. Yaldwyn Street forms part of the Leichhardt Highway, connecting Roma and Rockhampton, and is the main road in and out of Taroom. Although the tree's root system is largely covered by bitumen road, footpath paving and nearby commercial buildings, the tree appears to be in good condition.
The tree is a mature coolibah (Eucalyptus microtheca), indigenous to the Dawson River district. It has a height of about , and a canopy spread of about . Its age is estimated to be at least 300 years.
A sign placed in the branches of the tree reads LEICHHARDT TREE, but all blazes have been overgrown by the bark.
A plaque attached to the tree is inscribed:Leichhardt, the explorer, passed over this track and marked this Tree in 1844.At the foot of the tree, facing east to the street, is a small concrete block with a metal plaque attached, on which is inscribed:

The Faith of Anna Waters is a 2016 American-Singaporean horror film starring American actors Elizabeth Rice and Matthew Settle and directed by Kelvin Tong. Billed as Singapore's first Hollywood supernatural feature, the film tells the story of an American journalist who travels to Singapore to investigate the mysterious suicide of her sister, and delves into one of Tong's favourite horror subgenres: exorcism.
The film was released on 6 May 2016, in the USA under the title The Offering.
Plot
American journalist Jamie Waters (Elizabeth Rice) travels to Singapore to investigate the mysterious suicide of her sister, Anna. However, her sister's death is only the beginning of a sinister demonic ancient plan.

Reception
Despite scathing reviews of his latest movie, The Faith Of Anna Waters, Kelvin Tong remains nonchalant. He told The New Paper: "I'm so used to being slammed, so negative reviews don't affect me any more."
''Fangorias Michael Gingold: "It's never clear, plotwise, what is supposed to be on offer in THE OFFERING, though anyone with any familiarity with occult flicks will find they're being sold a very secondhand bill of goods."
The New York Times''' Andy Webster: "a muddled horror film, falls over itself incorporating as many genre elements as possible. The result is the cinematic equivalent of combining every paint color on a canvas: a murky mess."The Hollywood Reporters John DeFore: "Tong employs so many shock cuts and grating music cues viewers will likely find their curiosity fading quickly. What it all adds up to is either laughably baffling or just plain laughable, depending on how much attention one has paid."
Jersey John from "horrortalk.com": "Lackluster acting and too many plot points end up doing just the right amount of damage."
Distribution
The film has been bought for distribution in France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines. In Mexico the film is scheduled to have a theatrical release on July 8, 2016.

The Sinclair Sovereign was a high-end calculator introduced by Clive Sinclair's company Sinclair Radionics in 1976. It was an attempt to escape from the unprofitable low end of the market, and one of the last calculators Sinclair produced. Made with a case of pressed steel that a variety of finishes, it cost between and at a time when other calculators could be purchased for under . A number of factors meant that the Sovereign was not a commercial success, including the cost, high import levies on components, competition from cheaper calculators manufactured abroad, and the development of more power-efficient designs using liquid-crystal displays. Though it came with a five-year guarantee, issues such as short battery life limited its usefulness. The company moved on to producing computers soon afterwards.
The design by John Pemberton won a Design Council award, and there are examples of the Sovereign in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It had a Mostek MK50321N main integrated circuit and a small memory register, a LED display, and could perform a variety of a number of basic mathematical operations besides four-function arithmetic.
History
The Sovereign was one of the last calculators produced during Sinclair's foray into the calculator market that had started with the Sinclair Executive in September 1972. The Executive had retailed for when introduced, but in little over a year it was possible to purchase a Sinclair calculator for and by November 1976 a model was available for . Cheaper calculators with liquid-crystal displays instead of light-emitting diodes were becoming more popular, and had much longer battery lives of months or years. Such calculators were available for well under , with all the functionality of the more expensive models. The impossibility of selling "simple" calculators profitably led Sinclair to introduce models such as the Cambridge Scientific, introduced in August 1975 at a price of .
The Sovereign, released in 1976, represented an attempt to move upmarket in an increasingly saturated market. In December 1976, the chrome plated version of the Sovereign cost and the gold-plated version , including VAT, but profit margins on the Sovereign were so small that Sinclair ended up selling the Sovereign at a loss, and it was not a commercial success. The Sovereign was made in England, like every other Sinclair calculator except the President.
Sinclair would shortly stop producing calculators and instead focus on computers, starting with the MK14 in 1977. The loss of the calculator market was due in part to technological development leading to smaller and cheaper components, which put heavy pressure on profit margins. An import levy of up to 17.5% was placed on components, but the duty for calculators imported from Japan or Hong Kong could be as little as 5%, making it unprofitable to produce calculators in the UK. Sinclair also had some problems with the reliability of earlier calculators that had adversely affected its reputation, but the Sovereign was sold with a "full and unconditional" five year guarantee.
Design
The Sovereign came in satin chrome and gold-plated models, with leather pouches and fitted wooden cases. It had an 8-digit seven-segment display that used red light-emitting diodes, with a decimal point to the right of each digit that could be illuminated as necessary. Power was provided by two 1.35 mercury button cells. The Sovereign measured , which made it small and sleek compared to other calculators of the time.
The Sovereign was unusual because the casing was made from pressed steel, which gave it a much higher quality feel compared to injection moulded plastic. This allowed a variety of paint and plating options, including black painted, chrome-plated, silver-plated, and gold-plated, and a limited edition silver-plated version, inscribed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, were also produced. Asprey of London was rumoured to have produced two Sovereigns in solid gold, costing each.
The design, by John Pemberton, won the Design Council Award in 1977, as the Executive had in 1973, and there are examples in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Sovereigns are highly collectible, and used models command high prices.
Functions
As well as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and the ability to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. An independent memory register could read information from the screen, and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.
The Sovereign used a Mostek MK50321N main integrated circuit, the same as the Sinclair Wrist Calculator and some variants of the Sinclair Cambridge. Clive Sinclair had assumed that people would prefer attractive illuminated LED displays to LCD displays, which incidentally also required more expensive CMOS chips. However, his calculators were designed with the assumption they would be turned off between calculations, which did not prove to be the case. Advertisements suggested that the batteries would last "about a year" under normal use, but in reality the small button cell batteries and comparatively high power consumption meant a short battery life compared to the competition.

"A Writer's Prayer" is an English poem by the Indian poet and renowned spiritual healer Tarun Cherian. Cherian has had written many a poem beforehand with this one being his best work. A Writers Prayer won Second Prize in the Fifth All India Poetry Competition conducted by The Poetry Society (India) in 1993. The poem was his first major award-winning work. This poem was written by him in tribute to his wife Celia Cherian. Tarun eventually went on to make a mark in mysticism, spirituality and visual art.
Excerpts from the Poem
Let my words have an unvarnished feel to them. Truth writ in the grain. Sentences that feel like bark and offer comfort like a bench after a long walk into the hills with a woman.
*******
Let my words have the clearness of a stream - the seeing pebbles look. The kind through which you reach and pick a water smooth pebble. Or better still cupped in both hands, its icy coolness splashed on a sweaty face and arms dewed with a laughing run up a summery slope.
********
Let my words sound like a lullaby, rocking my child in its syllables rippling like gentle waves in an ocean with no shores.
Structure of the poem
The poem has a unique and original structure, which marks a departure from contemporary Indian poetry. Its five lines can be regarded as five stanzas or five paragraphs. The diction is that of prose, but the strong evocative imagery belongs to poetry of the highest quality. The five stanzas evoke images pertaining to five different sense organs – sight, smell, touch, hearing and smell. The poem can be thought of a bouquet of meditations on different paths to Truth.
Comments and criticism
The poem has received positive reviews since its first publication in 1994 in the book Voices of the Future. The poem has been frequently quoted in scholarly analysis of contemporary Indian English poetry.

The Student African American Brotherhood (SAAB), with over 168 chapters in the United States and abroad, was founded on the campus of Georgia Southwestern State University in Americus, Georgia on October 17, 1990. SAAB mentors young African American men by educating them on their responsibilities as United States citizens. The overall objective of the program is to make each young man aware of his potential, purpose, and life goals; however, much emphasis is focused on leadership development and training.
Responding to the needs of African American males at the University, Founder Dr. Tyrone Bledsoe had a vision to create an organization that would provide student development intervention and support to African American men enrolled in college.
He further designed Student African American Brotherhood as a black male development model, necessary to assist African American men in developing a more complete understanding of their responsibilities as college students and in being U.S. citizens.
The First International SAAB Leadership Institute was held at the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio March 4–6, 2004 under the theme, "Strength For Your Journey: Voices of the Past". Brothers from various chapters were able to meet with other brothers who held similar goals and aspirations.
The Student African American Brotherhood members serve their communities through mentorship, role modeling, and programming that highlights the experiences of African American culture as well as black men's roles in society.
History
The story of SAAB began in 1990 when it was established by Dr. Tyrone Bledsoe on October 17, 1990 on the campus of Georgia Southwestern State University. The organization was established to address the academic and social challenges of African American males at Georgia Southwestern and has many collegiate and high school chapters around the country. SAAB is an organization committed to providing opportunities for at-risk males in high school and college. SAAB believes it is a professional organization with members that serve as role models for inner-city neighborhoods throughout the country.
SAAB tries to assist men of color to realize and achieve their fullest potential by upholding a caring outlook and to transform themselves by changing their attitudes, mentoring their fellow brothers and providing positive leadership within their community. The organization's commitment to enhancing the school and life experiences of underprivileged men of color is fueled by the synergy of the college campus and the concept of graduating from high school and college as a means to survival and self-sufficiency. By mobilizing and developing human capital through our student participants, SAAB hopes to infuse our society with a culture of young men that will make a national impact and empower all people through appropriate mentoring and role modeling despite social disparities, to achieve an education and in turn play an active role in bettering the lives of others.
Dr. Tyrone Bledsoe
Dr. Tyrone Bledsoe resides in Toledo, Ohio. He was born and raised in Grenada, Mississippi. He received his Bachelor of Arts Degree and Master's of Education degree from Mississippi State University. He earned his Ph.D in Counseling and Student Affairs Administration from the University of Georgia; and was chosen as the Outstanding Doctoral Student in the State of Georgia and was most recently recognized as the Outstanding Doctoral Alumnus by the University of Georgia.
Recently, he served as Vice President for Student Life and Special Assistant to the President at The University of Toledo but has now transitioned temporarily to the role of Executive Director of the SAAB National Headquarters. He is the founder of the Student African American Brotherhood Organization (SAAB), which is a national organization established to enhance the experiences of and instill a “spirit of care” in African American males in high schools, colleges and universities around the country. He is a contributing author of recently released book “African American Men in College”, Jossey-Bass Publisher.
He is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity and is very active in the arena of higher education. He is recognized by several professional associations for his research, publications, presentations and scholarly work. In 1999, he was invited to Oxford, England to serve as a guest lecturer to discuss his work with African American males at the Oxford University Roundtable Institute, which is sponsored by the British Council. Also, he was invited to join an international research team to address issues around men of color in Europe, Trinidad, Barbados and the Bahamas. Dr. Tyrone Bledsoe has appeared on talk shows such as “Perfect Union” hosted by Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. to discuss his work involving African American and Latino Males.
Dr. Tyrone Bledsoe is deemed as one of the most gifted and dynamic motivational speakers by the thousands who have heard him speak. Recently, he was chosen as one of the most outstanding social innovators in the world by the Ashoka International Organization. He seeks to be a spiritual and thought-provoking lecturer. And most importantly to him, he is the father of one adult son, Tyrone Bledsoe, Jr.
Chapter structure
SAAB attempts to distinguish itself from other minority student programs in the following ways:
A national success rate as a dynamic educational-based organization that serves thousands of young men at 180 middle schools, high schools; community colleges and four-year institutions with chapters that are at least 5 years old. Eighty Six percent (86%) of SAAB student members graduate from college, compared to a national average of 42% among black men in particular.
To become a SAAB member one must accept the charge to be a role model and a mentor. SAAB members are polite, sincere, hardworking, and encouraging; knowing that these characteristics are counter to the popular but offensive negative images of young black and brown men in America.
SAAB members are required to tutor and mentor high school, middle school and elementary students as a way to seed the same caring spirit that SAAB promotes.
When compared to other male support groups and fraternal organizations geared towards the same population, SAAB maintains stricter membership requirements that are unrelated to entertainment or sports. SAAB Chapters must adhere to annual membership requirements and core standards to remain part of the national network and comply with implementation fidelity desired across all chapters.
Membership
SAAB membership is open to any student attending an institution that is a registered SAAB Chapter.
Successes
SAAB believes its graduated are more prepared to be competitive in the professional world of work and serve as role models for inner-city neighborhoods throughout the country. Over the past decade, SAAB has helped to ensure the continued academic success of African American males by helping 80% of SAAB participants persist from their freshman to sophomore year and helping 86% of SAAB participants graduate. This success greatly exceeds the 42% national rate of retention for African American males that persist from their freshman to sophomore year and the 55% average national five-year graduation rate for Black males. The SAAB program has attracted national attention as an innovative prototype for personal and academic enrichment, and has been successfully expanded to serve students at both public and private four-year institutions, including both predominantly white and historically Black institutions.

USS James S. Chambers was a schooner acquired by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.
Naming
The Navy named the ship after James S. Chambers. He was appointed Navy agent for the Port of Philadelphia on August 10, 1861, by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. He was already a co-owner and editor of the Philadelphia Bulletin (then known as the Evening Bulletin). In 1860, one partner sold out and, with increased ownership, the co-owners voted Chambers publisher, a position he held at least as late as 1878 (also listed as publisher of the Philadelphia Day). Chambers was an unabashed support of Lincoln not only due to his own position as Navy agent but also because his aged father had been made superintendent of warehouses for the Philadelphia customs service.
Service history
James S. Chambers was a three-masted schooner purchased by the Navy at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 4 September 1861; and commissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard 16 December, Lt. Dennis Condry in command. The schooner sailed from Philadelphia 6 days later and joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron at Ship Island, Mississippi, 23 January 1862. Her diligent service in the Gulf of Mexico and off the Florida coast was first rewarded on 23 August when she captured blockade-running schooner Corelia with a cargo of supplies badly needed by the South. Two days later she took Confederate steamer Union attempting to escape with a cargo of 350 bales of cotton.
James S. Chambers scored again on 4 March 1863—the second anniversary of Lincoln's inauguration—when men from her whaleboats boarded and took Spanish sloop Relampago with a cargo of coffee, liquors, and soldiers shoes. The triumph was capped late that afternoon when a sail was sighted to the south standing in for land. The unidentified ship ignored a shot across her bow and continued to race for the beach without showing any colors. The Union schooner continued the chase firing at her quarry until she ran aground. The following morning men from James S. Chambers boarded the wreck, a schooner of pilot boat-build, and identified her as Ida. They removed several boatloads of cargo before setting her afire. A final prize came on 18 June 1863 when the vigilant blockader captured schooner Rebekah.
A period of almost a year's blockading duty stationed at West Pass, St. George's Sound, Florida, ensued. On 12 May 1864 boats from James S. Chambers and drove off a body of Confederate sailors embarking on a boat expedition ordered to capture the Union's side-wheel steamer . In August 1864 James S. Chambers encountered a new enemy: yellow fever. The epidemic forced her to return to Philadelphia after taking the lives of 13 sailors and 3 officers. Only two or three members of her crew escaped the disease. On New Year's Day 1865 the indomitable ship was back in action with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron stationed at Bull's Bay, South Carolina She was in the joint expeditionary force which attacked the rear of Charleston, South Carolina, 12 February. A fortnight later, her boat crews raided and destroyed extensive Confederate salt works and stockpiles at Palmetto Point, South Carolina.
Toward the end of the war James 8. Chambers served as a quarantine vessel at Port Royal, South Carolina. She sailed for the North 27 July and decommissioned 31 August. James S. Chambers was sold at public auction in New York City to Mr. Rhinehart 27 September 1865.

During the 1960s, Rushing was active in the civil rights movement, working for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in Syracuse, New York, and was a community organizer for the Northern Student Movement in Boston. He directed Roxbury Associates which helped to found the Lower Roxbury Community Corporation, one of the first CDCs in the nation, and which began some of the earliest organizing in a black community against the war in Vietnam. Rushing was also the president of the Roxbury Historical Society. In 1969, Rushing worked for the Center for Inner City Change in Boston. He became the director of the Urban Change program at the Urban League in 1969.
From 1972 to 1985, he was President of the Museum of African American History in Boston. Under his direction, the museum purchased and began the restoration of the African Meeting House, the oldest extant black church building in the United States. In 1979, Byron oversaw the lobbying effort in Congress to establish the Boston African American National Historical Site, a component of the National Park Service. Byron led the museum in the study of the history of Roxbury; the museum conducted the archaeological investigation of the Southwest Corridor for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).

Yevstafii Vasilievich Skryplev () was a Russian military officer who defected to Qajar Iran, where he became commander of the Bogatyr battalion of the Qajar army. Upon repatriation to Russia, he became a successful Cossack commander in the Caucasian Host, eventually gaining the rank of ataman as well.
Biography
Not much is known regarding Skryplev's early life. Before his defection, he was a non-commissioned officer in the Nasheburg infantry regiment. In 1828, he moved to the Iranian camp. He entered the shah's service and married the daughter of Samson Makintsev, better known as Samson Khan, a Russian commander that had defected to the Iranians some years earlier. Makintsev made his son-in-law a colonel and commander of the Bogatyr battalion of Russian deserters. Being already a general, he himself took the battalion's honorary position of colonel-in-chief, as he had decided to retire from active service following the Russo-Iranian War of 1826–1828.
After the Bogatyr battalion on insisting policies of the Russian government was eventually disbanded, which had included the extensive encouragement of repatriation, as well as a proclamation of general amnesty by Tsar Nicholas I himself, many of its Russian soldiers were eventually forced to move back to the Russian territories with their families. Yevstafii – Makintsev's successor in the Iranian ranks as head of the Bogatyr battalion – was pardoned too, and thus he repatriated as well. On December 6, 1838, the battalion celebrated the name day of Nicholas I. According to historian Aleksandr Kibovskii, Skryplev was overcome by the ceremony and decided to go to Russia. This news stunned Samson Khan, and his daughter – the pregnant wife of Skryplev – miscarried out of fear, but followed her husband. On December 22, the battalion marched out of Tehran and arrived in Tabriz in exactly one month. The battalion stayed 15 days in Tabriz, collecting the families of the deserters, after which it went on further. On February 11, 1839, the battalion crossed the Russian border singing and with drums beating, and it conducted a prayer service for its safe exit from Iran. On March 5, the deserters arrived in Tbilisi. Overall, 1084 individuals came out of Iran; 597 "bogatyrs", 206 women, and 281 children. Those who remained continued in the military service of the Iranian monarch, but no longer formed an independent unit.
Among the returned deserters, the married men were enrolled in the Caucasian Line Cossack Host and settled in Cossack villages. The unmarried men were assigned to Finnish line battalions and the Archangel Garrison Battalions, with their years in Iranian service counted as being in the Russian army. Thirty old and decrepit men were released to their motherland. The Polish officers went home. All those who had converted to Islam received church dispensation of their "renunciation of the faith, caused by long sojourn in Iran and extreme circumstances".
Skryplev was fully pardoned, became a sotnik (Cossack lieutenant) in the Caucasian Host and settled in the Lana line. There, he eventually rose to the rank of yesaul (Cossack captain), as a result of his bravery in operations against the Caucasian mountaineers, and became ataman of the Chamlyksk Cossack settlement. Thus, the other former Russian deserters from Iran in the Caucasian Voiska continued regarding him as their leader, his word being "absolute law for us Iranian Cossacks". By the end of his life, his eyesight had begun to fail, supposedly because of his "constant use of henna to colour, Iranian-style, his eyebrows and eyelids". According to Kibovskii, he died in the early 1860s.
The Iranian intimate knowledge and experiences of Skryplev and other deserters gained thereby of the kind of society that the Russian Empire was attempting to conquer and annex, and made them an ideal for integration into the Cossack Voiska planted into Muslim territories. The life of Skryplev back in Russia, Makintsev's son-in-law and his successor as colonel of the regiment, provides a vivid illustration of the ease with which the deserters abandoned and embraced different roles and loyalties.

MTV Sound Trippin is a youth-based popular music television show on MTV India.
The show is part of MTV's strategy to focus more on original music.
Format
The show follows Hindi film music director Sneha Khanwalkar, who travels to ten cities across the country to record unusual sounds and make ten songs, one for each place she visits, that capture the spirit of the places. Talking about the show she says “The show's concept is such that we had to record songs in four days,” She only takes a backpack, recorder, laptop and a small crew with her as she travels to areas such as Leh; Majuli, Assam; Yellapura, Karnataka; Dharavi, Mumbai; Kila Raipur, Punjab, Kolkata and Goa.
The other element, which adds to the richness of the show, is showcasing of art forms like dance and theatre by the locals. She then uses stunning visuals and authentic sounds from her travels to create a brand-new track. Many of the local artists who record for the show " have never before recorded in a studio.”
Reception
The show was well received. Amitava Sanyal of Hindustan Times called the show a "remarkable experiment". Sneha Mahadevan of DNA said that "The shoots, crisp edits, refreshingly new visuals take this show to a new level altogether.". Meera Gopal of Abu Dhabi based newspaper, The National wrote that "It is the music of serendipity; the kind that cannot be composed in a recording studio or effortlessly crooned to rouse an auditorium to its feet."

Jean André Wahl (; 25 May 188819 June 1974) was a French philosopher.
Early career
Wahl was educated at the École Normale Supérieure. He was a professor at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, broken by World War II. He was in the U.S. from 1942 to 1945, having been interned as a Jew at the Drancy internment camp (north-east of Paris) and then escaped.
He began his career as a follower of Henri Bergson and the American pluralist philosophers William James and George Santayana. He is known as one of those introducing Hegelian thought in France in the 1930s (his book on Hegel was published in 1929), ahead of Alexandre Kojève's more celebrated lectures. He was also a champion in French thought of the Danish proto-existentialist Søren Kierkegaard. These enthusiasms, which became the significant books Le malheur de la conscience dans la Philosophie de Hegel (1929) and Études kierkegaardiennes (1938) were controversial, in the prevailing climate of thought. However, he influenced a number of key thinkers including Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the second issue of Acéphale, Georges Bataille's review, Jean Wahl wrote an article titled "Nietzsche and the Death of God", concerning Karl Jaspers' interpretation of this work. He became known as an anti-systematic philosopher, in favour of philosophical innovation and the concrete.
In exile
While in the USA, Wahl with Gustave Cohen and backed by the Rockefeller Foundation founded a 'university in exile', the École Libre des Hautes Études, in New York City. Later, at Mount Holyoke where he had a position, he set up the Décades de Mount Holyoke, also known as Pontigny-en-Amérique, modelled on meetings run from 1910-1939 by French philosopher Paul Desjardins (November 22, 1859 - March 13, 1940) at the site of the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny in Burgundy. These successfully gathered together French intellectuals in wartime exile, ostensibly studying the English language, with Americans including Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and Roger Sessions. Wahl, already a published poet, made translations of poems of Stevens into French. He was also an avid reader of the Four Quartets and toyed with the idea of publishing a poetical refutation of the poem. (See, e.g., his "On Reading the Four Quartets." )
Post World War II
In post-war France Wahl was an important figure, as a teacher and editor of learned journals. In 1946 he founded the Collège philosophique, influential center for non-conformist intellectuals, alternative to the Sorbonne. Starting in 1950, he headed the Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale.
Wahl translated the second hypothesis of the Parmenides of Plato as "Il y a de l'Un", and Jacques Lacan adopted his translation as a central point in psychoanalysis, as a sort of antecedent in the Parmenides of the analytic discourse. This is the existential sentence of psychoanalytic discourse according to Lacan, and the negative one is "Il n'y a pa de rapport sexuel " — there is no sexual relationship.

Wahl in literature
In 2021, Angelico Press published W.C. Hackett's novella Outside the Gates, based on the true story of Wahl's release from the Drancy Internment Camp. The narrator in the novella is Wahl himself, who alternatively tells what he is experiencing and muses philosophically on his situation in life, his sufferings and the sufferings of others in the war, and on whether or not there is a God. Hackett, himself a professional philosopher, artfully weaves in to the narrative former students and colleagues of Wahl.

Abu'l-Khattab Muslim ibn Muhriz ( – died ), also called Salm and Abdallah, was a well-known musician and singer of Mecca in Arabia. Of Persian origin, Ibn Muhriz was a freedman (mawla) of the Banu Abd al-Dar or Banu Makhzum. His father was one of the gatekeepers of the Ka'ba. Ibn Muhriz first studied under Ibn Misdjah and then under Azza al-Mayla. He completed musical education in Iran and Syria. Ibn Muhriz suffered from leprosy, and therefore refrained from appearing much in public. He appears to have been content to have his compositions performed by a slave girl musician. Due to his clinical condition, Ibn Muhriz may have never attended the Umayyad court at Damascus, although a passage written by the 10th-century historian al-Masudi might imply that he was a musician in the retinue of Caliph Al-Walid II (743–744).

Chaetosphaeridium globosum is a one-celled alga which is thought to represent an ancient lineage of the green plants. This organism exists in a filamentous form with one flagellum per cell. It is a freshwater species. The flagellum is covered in scales in a 3-prong irregular shape called ‘maple leafs'. The cells are usually in diameter and with one pyrenoid. Each cell bears long bristle.
Researchers have found that the mitochondrial DNA of Chaetosphaeridium is markedly different from that of land plants, suggesting that the mitochondria of land plants evolved significantly after the common ancestor between them and living green algae. A very slight similarity exists between liverwort mtDNA and Chaetosphaeridium. The chloroplast DNA is markedly similar, however, indicating that a close relationship had existed between the Viridiplantae and the clade that includes Chaetosphaeridium. This seems to argue that chloroplasts in green plants originated in prehistoric green algae; the family which includes Chaetosphaeridium globosum.
Chloroplasts are known to be captured (symbiotic) cyanobacteria with their own genome. Part of this genome has been transferred to the nucleus and part has been retained in the chloroplast for the continuation of metabolic processes. This symbiosis, now proven by modern genomics, has shown us how Chaetosphaeridium globosum links ancient cyanobacteria with modern green plants.

The Strand underpass is a one-way road tunnel in central London connecting Waterloo Bridge to Kingsway near Holborn. Opened in 1964, it was built within the former Kingsway tramway subway, which closed in the 1950s.
History
The underpass is built within part of the former Kingsway tramway subway, which was wide and allowed bi-directional flow because of the fixed rails and relatively narrow width of the trams. The new underpass was built by John Mowlem & Co and opened on 21 January 1964. It is only wide and, as a result, it is normally one-way northbound because of the side clearances required. The headroom is only due to the tunnel having to pass beneath the bridge abutment by a 1:12 gradient. An electronic 'eye' alerts drivers of tall vehicles and diverts them to an 'escape route' to the left of the entrance. However, high vehicles do still try to pass through and so get stuck occasionally.
The underpass is a concrete box within the former tram subway, with the road surface at the original track level. At the northern end of the underpass the road rises to the surface on a new carriageway supported by metal pillars. This passes through the site of the former Aldwych tramway station; because of the greater width requirement, 27 trees and some pavement sections were removed for it to be constructed.
The tunnel is used by the 521 bus route northbound. In 2012, the direction of traffic in the tunnel was temporarily reversed, so that it was in use by southbound traffic. This was to facilitate easier traffic flow during the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Canterbury Golf Club is a private golf and country club located in the Cleveland suburb of Beachwood, Ohio, US. The club was formerly the home of the DAP Championship, part of the Web.com Tour Finals.
A member club of the USGA, Canterbury has been recognized by Golf Digest as one of the top 100 courses in the United States. The club has hosted the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship, as well as the U.S. Senior Open, the Senior PGA Championship, and the U.S. Amateur.
History
Following its establishment on February 2, 1921, by a contingent of Cleveland's University Club, the club purchased a site in a sparsely developed suburban area located approximately southeast of downtown Cleveland. The property lays primarily in Beachwood and, at its northernmost tip, in Shaker Heights. The site was chosen for its high elevation, rolling hills, brooks, and wooded areas.
Designed by architect Herbert Strong, development of the course began in 1921. The first nine holes were opened on July 1, 1922. The second nine were completed shortly thereafter. The course was later enlarged and reconstructed, in 1928, by W. H. Way.
The club is named for Canterbury, Connecticut, the birthplace of Cleveland's founder, General Moses Cleaveland. Female members were first admitted in 1923.
Yardage and ratings
Notable facts
Canterbury is the second club to host all five of the men's rotating major championships, played within the United States: the U.S. Open, the U.S Senior Open, the PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, and the U.S. Amateur. (Oak Hill C.C. completed the set of five in 2008, one year before Canterbury did so.)
Canterbury was the site of Jack Nicklaus' 12th major professional victory, the 1973 PGA Championship. With this victory and his two U.S. Amateur championships, Nicklaus surpassed Bobby Jones' career record of 13 professional/amateur majors.
The competitive course record is 66, held by six players: Al Geiberger, Lee Trevino, Don Iverson, Denny Lyons, and Buddy Allin (all at the 1973 PGA Championship) and Bobby Clampett (at the 1979 U.S. Amateur).
In 2009 at Canterbury, Michael Allen became the second man, after Arnold Palmer, to debut on the Senior (Champions) Tour by winning the Senior PGA Championship.
At 608 yards, Canterbury's sixteenth hole and the seventh at Brooklawn C.C. are the longest Par 5 holes ever played at a U.S. Senior Open
Canterbury hosted the first four Senior Tournament Players Championships, 1983–86.
Major tournaments hosted
Canterbury has been the site of 13 major championships at the professional, senior professional, and amateur levels. Modern day majors of the PGA Tour are highlighted.
a – Unofficial major.

Mockingjay is a 2010 science fiction novel by American author Suzanne Collins. It is chronologically the last installment of The Hunger Games series, following 2008's The Hunger Games and 2009's Catching Fire. The book continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, who agrees to unify the districts of Panem in a rebellion against the tyrannical Capitol.
The hardcover and audiobook editions of Mockingjay were published by Scholastic on August 24, 2010, six days after the ebook edition went on sale. The book sold 450,000 copies in the first week of release, exceeding the publisher's expectations. It received a generally positive reaction from critics. The book has been adapted into a two-part movie, with the first part released on November 21, 2014, and the second part released on November 20, 2015.
Inspiration and development
Collins has said that the main inspiration for The Hunger Games series came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided to put an end to the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.
Collins has said that there are also many parallels between the Roman Empire and the fictional nation of Panem. She describes the Hunger Games as "an updated version of the Roman gladiator games, which entails a ruthless government forcing people to fight to the death as popular entertainment." Collins also explains that the name "Panem" came from the Latin phrase "Panem et Circenses", which means "Bread and Circuses" and refers to the strategy used by Roman emperors to appease the masses by providing them with food and entertainment (Juvenal, Satires, 10.81).
As with the previous books in the trilogy, Mockingjay contains 27 chapters, with nine chapters in each of the three parts. This structure, which Collins had previously used in her series The Underland Chronicles, came from Collins's playwriting background. This "three-act" structure is also apparent in the trilogy as a whole; Collins stated that she "knew from the beginning" that she was going to write a trilogy.
The cover and title information was revealed by Scholastic on February 11, 2010. The cover continues the previous books' theme on the symbol of peace. The novel's title comes from the hybrid birds of the same name that feature in the novels' storyline. As Publishers Weekly has stated, "the hybrid birds that are an important symbol—of hope and rebellion—throughout the books". Collins likens Katniss to a Mockingjay because both "should never have existed".
Plot
Following Catching Fire, Katniss Everdeen, her mother, her sister Primrose Everdeen, mentor Haymitch Abernathy, and her friends Finnick Odair and Gale Hawthorne, along with the survivors from District 12, adjust to life underground in District 13, headquarters of the rebellion in Panem. Katniss reluctantly agrees to act as "the Mockingjay”–the symbol of the rebellion–for rebel propaganda, on the condition that District 13's President Alma Coin grants immunity to all surviving Hunger Games tributes, including Katniss's friend Peeta Mellark and Finnick's lover Annie Cresta. Coin, however, insists on flipping a coin for Katniss's other demand: the right to personally execute Panem President Coriolanus Snow. Katniss is sent to a hospital in District 8 to film the destruction that the Capitol has inflicted, and while Haymitch orders her to retreat as soon as a raid begins, she stays behind and fights before giving a speech that is broadcast in all twelve districts. The Capitol tortures Peeta to demoralize Katniss. A rescue team extracts Peeta along with the other captured victors, but discover that he has been brainwashed to fear and despise Katniss. He attempts to kill her, and is restrained under heavy guard while medics seek a cure. Finnick and Annie marry in a propaganda effort.
Katniss and Gale are sent to persuade District 2 to join the rebellion. Gale's controversial strategy results in a decisive victory over District 2, enabling a final assault against the Capitol itself. Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent with a film crew to shoot propaganda in the Capitol. President Coin also sends Peeta, still dangerous and unpredictable; Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead for her lack of support and growing influence. While filming in a supposedly safe Capitol neighborhood, the team's commander Boggs is fatally wounded; before dying, he gives Katniss the team's command. She decides to infiltrate the Capitol and kill Snow, telling her team that this was Coin's secret plan; she later reveals the lie, but the team sticks with her. In the ensuing urban warfare, many of Katniss's comrades, including Finnick, are killed. As the last of her squad reaches Snow's mansion, a hovercraft bearing the Capitol seal drops bombs among a group of children being used as human shields. Rebel medics, including Prim, rush in to help the injured children, and the remaining bombs detonate. Prim is killed, and Katniss sustains severe burns.
As she recuperates, Katniss, deeply depressed over her sister's death, learns the rebels have taken over the Capitol and Snow is to be publicly executed. She confronts Snow, who claims that Coin orchestrated the bombing to turn Snow's remaining supporters against him, reminding Katniss of their promise to never lie to each other and how District 13 benefited from the revolution. Horrified, Katniss realizes Gale had earlier proposed a similar tactic. She becomes convinced that, rather than establish a republic governed by representatives from each District, Coin intends to take Snow's place and maintain the status quo. Coin hosts a referendum for the remaining Victors to decide whether to host another Hunger Games for the Capitol children. Although three, including Peeta, are against the plan, Katniss, Haymitch and two others outvote them.
Set to execute Snow, Katniss instead shoots Coin and immediately attempts suicide, but Peeta stops her, and she is arrested in the ensuing riot. Snow is later found dead, and rebel Commander Paylor of District 8 takes over as president. Katniss is acquitted of murder by reason of insanity and sent home to District 12, while her mother leaves for District 4 and Gale leaves for District 2. Other District 12 natives later return, including Peeta, who has recovered his memories and his love for Katniss. She embraces him, recognizing her need for his hope and strength. Together, they write a book to preserve the memory of those who died. Though still suffering flashbacks and screaming nightmares, they manage to comfort each other.
Twenty years later, Katniss and Peeta are married and have two children. Under Paylor's administration, the Hunger Games are abolished with the arenas replaced by memorials. Katniss is happy with her new life and her family, but still carries mental and emotional scars, and dreads the day her children learn about their parents' involvement in the war and the Games. She tells her young daughter that when she feels distressed, she plays a comforting, repetitive game: reminding herself of every good thing she has ever seen someone do. The series ends with Katniss's reflection that there are much worse games to play.
Themes
Reviews have noted many themes in the previous books that are also explored in Mockingjay. A review from The Baltimore Sun noted that "the themes of the series, including physical hardships, loyalty in extreme circumstances and traversing morally ambiguous terrain, are continued at an even larger scale." In the book, Katniss must deal with betrayal and violence against people. At the same time, while she was symbolically touching thousands of lives, she must also lead those people into war. Finally, Katniss realizes she cannot even trust President Coin, leader of District 13.
In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the series "tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war." Collins replied that this inspiration was from her father, who, when going to war in Vietnam, made sure that his children understood the consequences and effects of war. Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor noted that it was "the most brutal of the trilogy" and that "Collins doesn't take war lightly – her characters debate the morality involved in tactics used to try to overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those tactics." Katie Roiphe of The New York Times wrote that "it is the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world." In a review for USA Today, Bob Minzesheimer pointed out that the novel contained optimism: "Hope emerges from despair. Even in a dystopian future, there's a better future."
Minzesheimer also noted a central question of "Real or not real?" which was asked throughout the novel by Peeta. Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times also pointed this out, writing, "Mockingjay takes readers into new territories and an even more brutal and confusing world: one where it's unclear what sides the characters are on, one where presumed loyalties are repeatedly stood on their head".
Publication history
Mockingjay was first released in the US and Canada on August 24, 2010. The UK, New Zealand and Australia received the book one day later, on August 25, 2010. The audiobook was released simultaneously on August 24, 2010, by Scholastic Audio.
Sales
The book had a 1.2 million-copy first printing that was bumped up from 750,000. In its first week of release, the book sold over 450,000 copies. Following this, Scholastic printed an additional 400,000 copies, bringing the initial print run up to 1.6 million. Scholastic Trade president Ellie Berger said that sales "have exceeded all expectations". The book has also been released in e-book format and topped sales in the week ending with August 29, 2010, beating out The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which had held the top spot since April. The other Hunger Games books have also made it in the top ten, with the first book at fifth and the second book taking eighth. , the book has sold over 9 million copies.
Release
Promotion
To promote the release of Mockingjay, many bookstores held midnight release parties. The official event in New York City was attended by Collins, and included many activities such as a tarot card reader, a magician, jugglers and face-painters. Prizes such as signed copies of Catching Fire and Hunger Games-themed cups were raffled. Once Collins arrived, she read the first chapter of the novel, explaining that she would read with an accent since Katniss, the narrator, is from Appalachia. By midnight, copies were being sold with a signature stamp since Collins had a hand injury and was unable to sign.
Before the release, Scholastic also released a trailer for the book, launched a Facebook page that gained over 22,000 fans in 10 days, and held a contest for booksellers to win a visit from Collins and an online countdown clock to the release date. There were also advertisements for the book on websites such as Entertainment Weekly and Romantic Times. National Entertainment Collectibles Association also sold other goods such as T-shirts, posters, games and bracelets. Collins also held a "13-District Blog Tour" where 13 winners received a free copy of Mockingjay on August 24, 2010. A tour was also scheduled, starting at Books of Wonder in New York where the official party took place. The tour ended on November 6, 2010, in the Third Place Books store in Lake Forest Park, Washington.
Critical reception
Mockingjay has received critical acclaim. According to literary review aggregator bookmarks, the novel received a cumulative "Rave" rating based on 11 reviews. Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, calling it "the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level". The review went on to praise the "sharp social commentary and the nifty world building". Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B+ and said, "Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot". Kirkus Reviews gave Mockingjay a starred review, saying that the novel is exactly what its fans are looking for and that "it will grab them and not let go". Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times compared the battlefield to Iraq and said that the book is every bit as original as the first in the series, ending the review with "Wow".
The Baltimore Sun Nancy Knight commented that the book "ends on an ostensibly happy note, but the heartbreaking effects of war and loss aren't sugar-coated" and that it will have readers thinking about the effects of war on society. Katie Roiphe of The New York Times said it is "the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world". However, she criticized that it was not as "impeccably plotted" as The Hunger Games. Bob Minzesheimer of USA Today gave the book three out of four stars. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp described it as "an entirely gripping read".
Some critics noted that there was a suspense drop between Catching Fire and the start of Mockingjay. While a review from The Sacramento Bee praised the action scenes and the battle in the Capitol, the reviewer also criticized Collins for not giving enough time to finish all the loose ends, writing that "the disappointment with Mockingjay hits primarily as Collins starts her home stretch. It's almost as if she didn't allocate enough time or chapters to handle all her threads".
Film adaptation
The Hunger Games trilogy was adapted into a series of films, with the stars of the 2012 film The Hunger Games signed on for all four films. Mockingjay was split into two parts; Part 1 was released on November 21, 2014, and Part 2 was released on November 20, 2015. Francis Lawrence, director of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, returned to direct the two final films in the series. Julianne Moore played President Coin.

Microbivory (adj. microbivorous, microbivore) is a feeding behavior consisting of eating microbes (especially bacteria) practiced by animals of the mesofauna, microfauna and meiofauna.
Microbivorous animals include some soil nematodes, springtails or flies such as Drosophila sharpi. A well known example of microbivorous nematodes is the model roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans which is maintained in culture in labs on agar plates, fed with the 'OP50' Escherichia coli strain of bacteria.
In food webs of ecosystems, microbivores can be distinguished from detritivores, generally thought playing the roles of decomposers, as they don't consume decaying dead matter but only living microorganisms.
Use of term in robotics
There is also an use of the term 'microbivore' to qualify the concept of robots autonomously finding their energy in the production of bacteria. Robert Freitas has also proposed microbivore robots that would attack pathogens in the manner of white blood cells.

Wirt Dexter Walker (September 1, 1860 – April 24, 1899) was a Chicago lawyer. He was the son of successful Chicago attorney James M. Walker and Eliza M. Walker, and was named after Wirt Dexter, the junior partner at his father's firm, Walter VanArman & Dexter.
Biography
Wirt Dexter Walker was born in Chicago on September 1, 1860.
After his graduation from Yale University he inherited a large sum of money upon his father's death. He began his own practice in 1883, and was secretary of the University Club of Chicago in 1887. He had health problems and became blind, at which point he retired from office work to travel.
He married Marie Winston in 1894.
He died at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City on April 24, 1899. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.
Blythewood Farms summer cottage
He purchased land in the Berkshire County in 1888 and hired local architect H. Neill Wilson to design a large summer cottage retreat in 1890, hoping a residence in the area would help his health improve. Blythewood was constructed, but Walker died a year later leaving no children. Wilson went on to design several other mansions for wealthy persons establishing summer retreats in the area, including Shadowbrook.
His wife was left with a $15,000 annual inheritance and the Blythewood "cottage" on after his death. Speculation on whether she would lose the income was reported in newspapers as she prepared to marry another lawyer, Victor Elting. She did not lose her income, but the property went to Wirt D. Dexter Art Gallery in Chicago whose trustees "sold it in 1905 to a Chicago tycoon, John Alden Spoor". Spoor was chairman of the board of the Union Stockyards and Transit Company in Chicago, and sold Blythewood to a group of local investors two years before his death in 1926.

Clifford Ballard (26 June 1910 – 16 July 1997) was a British orthodontist. He became England's first Professor of Orthodontics in 1956. He served as the President of BSSO in 1957.
Life
He attended Royal Dental Hospital in 1934. He then studied medicine at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School and graduated from there in 1940. He became an orthodontist in Middlesex County the same year. In 1948, he joined the Institute of Dental Surgery at the Eastman Dental Hospital as Head of the Orthodontic Department. Ballard's interest in the field pertained to the respiratory function and the effects of orofacial musculature on malocclusions. During his stay at the Eastman Hospital, he organized a two-day symposium for the orthodontists in the country. In 1961. With the help of John Hovell he formed the Consultant Orthodontists Group (COG).
He married Muriel Burling in 1937 and had two children, a son and a daughter.
Ballard Conversion Tracing
Ballard described a method for studying the jaw relationship in the Antero-Posterior direction in 1951. This method used the axial inclination of the incisor teeth to study the relationship. This method removes any influence of soft tissues and dental compensation and permits an adjustment to the inclination of the maxillary and mandibular incisors to their normal value in respect to maxillary and mandibular planes. This method uses incisor overjet as the indicator of the relative position of the maxilla to the mandible. Thus the overjet describes the skeletal discrepancy.

Jean-Baptiste Mauzaisse (1 November 1784, Corbeil - 15 November 1844, Paris) was a French painter and lithographer; specializing in battle scenes and portraits.
Biography
He came from a modest background. His father was the organist at Corbeil Cathedral, and could not afford to pay for Jean-Baptiste's studies. At the age of nineteen, he left home and was able to find a position in the studios of François-André Vincent, at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His début at the Salon came in 1808, and he obtained a first-class gold medal there in 1812, for Arab Lamenting the Death of His Courser.
Many of his commissions were for the government, often in collaboration with other artists. These included decorating the apartments of King Louis XVIII, the figures of Prometheus and Tantalus for the Musée de Picardie in Amiens (1819), and several plafonds at the Louvre (1822), in what is now known as the "Salle des Bijoux". These feature figures representing Science, Art, Commerce, and War, as well as the four seasons. For his work there, he was named a Knight in the Legion of Honor in 1823.
He also created decorations for two cathedrals, the Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Bourges, and the Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Nantes. In 1837, he received a personal commission from Louis-Philippe, to portray him at the Battle of Valmy.
A significant number of his works are in private collections. In addition to those at the Louvre, some may be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

Black cocaine () is a mixture of regular cocaine base or cocaine hydrochloride with various other substances. These other substances are added
to camouflage the typical appearance (pigments and dyes, e.g. charcoal),
to interfere with color-based drug tests (mixing thiocyanates and iron salts or cobalt salts forms deep red complexes in solution),
to make the mixture undetectable by drug sniffing dogs (activated carbon may sufficiently absorb trace odors).
Since the result is usually black, it is generally smuggled as toner, fingerprint powder, fertilizer, pigment, metal moldings, or charcoal. The pure cocaine base can be recovered from the mixture by extraction (freebase) or acid-base extraction (hydrochloride) using common organic solvents such as methylene chloride or acetone. A second process is required to convert cocaine base into powdered cocaine hydrochloride.
It was reported that in the mid-1980s Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet ordered his army to build a clandestine cocaine laboratory in Chile where chemists mixed cocaine with other chemicals to produce what Pinochet's former top aide for intelligence Manuel Contreras described as a "black cocaine" capable of being smuggled past drug agents in the US and Europe.
Black cocaine was detected in Bogota, Colombia in May 1998. In 2008, a new type of black cocaine was discovered by police in Spain. It had been manufactured into rubber-like sheets and made into luggage. In 2021, of black cocaine disguised as charcoal, in 30 sacks among 1,364 sacks of charcoal, were seized in Spain, one of the biggest cocaine seizures recorded in Castilla y León.

Criticism and fiction
In the Sveriges Radio show Vetenskapsradion Historia (aired 8 May 2014), historian Anita du Rietz stated that the series inaccurately portrays the situation of women during the early 1900s, and also misrepresents the work of Anna Whitlock. According to du Rietz, women's working situation at the time was much better than what is shown in the series.

The Kanzhal War () or Crimean-Circassian War of 1708 was military conflict in 1708 fought between 7,000 Circassians led by Kurgoqo Atajuq and 30,000-100,000 Crimean Tatars led by Qaplan I Giray, which resulted in Circassian victory. It played a big role in decreasing foreign influence in Circassia. In 2013, the Russian Academy of Sciences described the battle as "an important event in the history of Circassians". It was fought near the village of Bylym on the Baksan River.
General
In 1708, the Circassians paid a great tribute to the Ottoman sultan Ahmed III to be exempt from Tatar raids and extra tribute, but the sultan did not take measures and the Tatars raided and plundered all the way to the east of Circassia, and asked for double tribute. The Kabardian Circassians announced that they would not pay double tribute to the Crimean Khan and the Ottoman Sultan. The Ottomans sent their army of at least 20,000 men to Kabardia under the leadership of the Crimean khan Qaplan I Giray to defeat the Circassians and collect tribute. The Ottomans expected an easy victory against the Circassians, but the Circassians were victorious with the strategy set up by the Jabagh Qazaneqo and returned to paying normal tribute.
Although foreign sources report different figures on the number of the Crimean-Ottoman army, criticals consider the figure of at least 25–30 thousand people to be reliable. This figure is in particular a reference to the letter of Prince Tatarhan Bekmurzovich, who should know the number of his enemy.
Circassians pretended to escape from the Tatar armies, and led them into the center of Circassia. They then sent letters to Khan's camp expressing their obedience, willingness to pay tribute and asked for peace. Later, for 19 days, 30 Circassian spies stalled the enemy troops by negotiating the amount and quality of the tribute to be paid, and then unexpectedly attacked the camp from all sides, and applied the strategy of Qazaneqo Jabagh: Donkeys with scary masks were put on fire, making them look like otherworldly monsters, greatly reducing morale of the Crimean army. Circassians then charged, and the Crimean-Ottoman army was completely destroyed overnight. Exhausted from the war, the Circassians wandered the battlefield for several days looking for survivors, both of them and their enemies. According to Shora Nogmov, they found Alegot Pasha, who, unconsciously and desperately fled from the battlefield and fell off a cliff, clung to a tree with his feet and died on the spot. Some recent research has claimed that the noble Nogay Murza Allaguvat was hiding under the name Alegoth.
Mentions of the event by foreign sources
Abri de la Motre
Abri de la Motre (agent of the Swedish king Charles XII), who visited the Caucasus in 1711, gave a detailed description of this battle. Motre published a description of his travels in London in 1724 in English in two volumes. He republished them in French in 1727.
A brief chronology of events, according to Motre, is as follows:
Circassians paid a large annual tribute to the sultan to avoid Tatar raids. However, the sultan did not fulfill this obligation and the Tatars raided all the way to the center of Circassia, robbing everything they could.
Circassians thought not only to stop these attacks, but also to refuse to pay tribute. The Sultan formed a Tatar army against the Circassians (about 100 thousand in number, according to Motre).
Circassians sent letters to Khan's camp expressing their obedience and asking for peace. Later, for 19 days, the Circassians stalled the enemy troops by negotiating the amount and quality of the tribute to be paid, and then unexpectedly attacked the camp from all sides and killed most of the soldiers.
Leading those who escaped to save their lives, the Khan left his brother, son, field tools, tents and belongings.
Xaverio Glavani
Xaverio Glavani, the French consul in Crimea and the first doctor of the Khan in Bakhchysarai, wrote in his book "Circassian Statement" dated 20 January 1724:
Johann Gustav Gerber
Johann Gustav Gerber, who made a map of the Caucasus for Tsarist Russia in 1728 and a depiction of the peoples living in the Caucasus, also reported this war:
Engelbert Kämpfer
German traveler Engelbert Kämpfer also mentioned the event:
Other sources
In addition to the above, in the 18th century Ottoman writer Mehmet Funduklu, the former Moldovan ruler and scientist Dimitrie Cantemir and many others wrote about the victory of the Kabardinians over the Crimean Khan in 1708, although their reports agreed on the main point, sometimes differing in detail.
Legacy
In 2008, Circassians celebrated the 300th anniversary of their victory in the Battle of Kanzhal. Circassian activists organized a trip in the direction of the war and a monument was erected in the area.
In 2018, events were organized for the 310th anniversary of the war. However, in the village of Kendelen, the local people of Balkar origin blocked the path of a Circassian flag group and attacked the celebrating Circassians, and Russian forces intervened as clashes between Circassians and Balkars intensified.
Similar clashes occurred in 2008 when the people of Karachay-Balkar hung posters "There was no battle in Kanzhal".

The Center of Puerto Rican Art (Spanish: Centro de Arte Puertorriqueño, CAP) was a print workshop and exhibition venue established by Lorenzo Homar, Rafael Tufiño, José Antonio Torres Martinó, Félix Rodríguez Báez and Julio Rosado del Valle in 1950. The workshop was inspired by the Mexican Taller de Gráfica Popular and appealed to populist ideas about art for the masses.
Exhibition and portfolios
Despite the short life of the CAP, many young and important Puerto Rican artists were involved in the workshop. The center evolved out of the artistic collaborations going on at the Puerto Rican Division of Community Education and the earlier Estudio 17. The prints produced at the CAP appealed to the masses through populist and nationalist messages. They held an exhibition in 1951 titled The Puerto Rican Print that included a statement of the organization's goals. A portfolio of prints is published and available for purchase along with the exhibition. The CAP closed in 1952, but its efforts contributed to a growing printmaking culture in Puerto Rico. Artists from the CAP continued to collaborate and produce portfolios, such as Lorenzo Homar and Rafael Tufiño's 1953 Portafolio de Plenas.

The Eyeliners are an all-woman American pop punk band from Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States.
History
The band formed in 1995 under the name Psychodrama by three sisters, guitarist Gel, bassist Lisa, and singer Laura Baca. The three auditioned both male and female drummers, but couldn't find one suitable for their planned style of music. Laura began experimenting with the drum set they had been using for auditions, and soon picked up the drumbeat despite never having played the instrument. About halfway through the rendition of the song, she started to sing along. The sisters stopped auditioning and Laura became both lead vocalist and drummer.
The band played their first show under the name Psychodrama and released a single, "Vivid". In 1996 the sisters changed their band name to The Eyeliners while touring the west coast, as more appropriate for their musical style.
Under their new name, the group has released EPs on Sympathy for the Record Industry followed by albums on Lookout Records in 2000 and 2001. The 2005 album No Apologies (Blackheart Records) includes a cover of When in Rome's 1988 song "The Promise."
A few months later, The Eyeliners played a show with the Red Aunts. Red Aunts frontwoman, Terri Wahl, introduced them to owner of Sympathy For the Record Industry, Long Gone John. Soon, the Eyeliners debut CD and 7” were released. Two more seven inches (“Do The Zombie” and “Rock N Roll, Baby”) followed on Sympathy for the Record Industry over the next couple of years.

The 2021 Games of the Small States of Europe, also known as the XIX Games of the Small States of Europe, is a cancelled sporting event, previously scheduled to take place in Andorra la Vella, the capital city of Andorra. Andorra has previously held the 1991 and the 2005 installments of the Games. The 2021 games were cancelled due to the rescheduling of the 2020 Summer Olympics in July 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Andorra looking to instead host the 2025 games.
Candidacy and preparation
The nations of the GSSE host the event on a rotational basis every two years. Although Malta was originally expected to host the 2021 Games, they instead decided to swap places with Andorra in order to give enough time to build the necessary infrastructure. In May 2016, Andorra confirmed its candidacy for hosting the 2021 Games.
In February 2019, the Organising Committee of the Games first met and was formed of Antoni Martí (the then Prime Minister of Andorra), Olga Gelabert, Marc Pons, Jaume Martí, Jordi Cerqueda, Josep Besolí, Jordi Beal.
In May 2019, Jaume Marti Mandico, president of the Andorran Olympic Committee, was appointed as the President of the Games of the Small States of Europe, as is customary during editions of the Games.

Edward Nye "Ed Don" George Jr. (June 3, 1905 – September 18, 1985) was an American amateur and professional wrestler, and wrestling promoter. A former Olympic freestyle wrestler, George competed in the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics and turned pro shortly after. He was two-time AWA World Heavyweight Champion.
Career
George was born in North Java, New York. He wrestled for both St. Bonaventure University and for the University of Michigan. He also represented the United States in freestyle wrestling at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, placing fourth in the heavyweight class (87 kg). During the years 1926–29, Ed Don George attended the University of Michigan, with his concentration of study in engineering. Later on, in 1929, at St. Bonaventure University, he graduated from with a college degree.
Quick and powerful, he took on the name "Ed Don George" and began his professional career shortly after returning from the Olympics. He captured the AWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 10, 1930, from Gus Sonnenberg. Double-crossed by Ed "Strangler" Lewis in Los Angeles on April 13, 1931 , George dropped the title to the Strangler. George refused to wrestle Lewis in a shoot contest, admitting he would lose to Lewis in a real match. However, promoter Paul Bowser maneuvered it back to George, who held it for nearly four years, finally losing it to Danno O'Mahony on June 30, 1935. George remained one of the top box office draws of the 1930s, and on April 5, 1937, defeated Al Perreira in Paris to capture the European version of the world title.
In March 1942 he joined the US Navy. There he taught hand-to-hand combat to naval air cadets. In December 1945 he left the navy with the rank of Commander.
During the late 1940s through the 1950s he promoted numerous wrestling matches in the United States. In the mid 1950s he found himself promoting wrestling at the casinos in Havana, Cuba until Fidel Castro came to power.
In 1949, Ed Don George bought a parcel just east of North Java, New York where Camp O'Ryan was situated. He then very soon afterwards leased this land for 25 years to the Federal government, which built, in conjunction with New York State, a New York National Guard training site.
Ed Don George died in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida on September 18, 1985 and his body buried in the village of North Java, New York. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2006 he was inducted posthumously into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.

Ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate is an organometallic compound with the formula [Fe(C5H5)2]PF6. This salt is composed of the cation [Fe(C5H5)2]+ and the hexafluorophosphate anion (). The related tetrafluoroborate is also a popular reagent with similar properties. The cation is often abbreviated Fc+ or Cp2Fe+. The salt is deep blue in color and paramagnetic.
Ferrocenium salts are one-electron oxidizing agents, and the reduced product, ferrocene, is relatively inert and readily separated from ionic products. The ferrocene–ferrocenium couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry. In acetonitrile solution that is 0.1 M in NBu4PF6, the Fc+/Fc couple is +0.641 V with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode.
Preparation and structure
Commercially available, this compound may be prepared by oxidizing ferrocene with ferric salts followed by addition of hexafluorophosphoric acid.
The compound is monoclinic with well-separated cation and anion; the may rotate freely. The average Fe-C bond length is 2.047 Å, which is virtually indistinguishable from the Fe-C distance in ferrocene.

Civil Service Live is a series of events in the United Kingdom designed to share best practice, promote innovation and drive collaboration across all government departments and agencies across the Civil Service.
Overview
It was launched by the Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell and Civil Service World in April 2008.
The national event has featured high-profile speakers (including Peter Jones from Dragons Den), workshops, an innovation space, a civil service history museum and other exciting content.
In addition to the national event in London, Civil Service Live stages a number of regional events across the country, the first of these was Gateshead in 2009 and events have also taken place in Manchester and Belfast.
The London venue moved to London Olympia in 2010, swiftly followed the general election and provided a platform for the prime minister, deputy prime minister and many other secretaries of state to address their departmental senior management teams. The move to Olympia was not popular with civil servants, who complained the venue was difficult to get to and not pleasant to be at. The venue moved back to central London in the mid-2010s.
To go alongside the site, the Civil Service Live Network has been set up and now has over 30,000 users. It provides networking tools and news from Civil Service World for members of the civil service community and wider public sector. The Civil Service Live Network has since been discontinued by Dods.
In 2018, Civil Service Live will take place in Glasgow on 7 June, Birmingham on 13 June, Blackpool on 27 June, Cardiff on 5 July, Newcastle on 12 July and in London on 17 and 18 July. The website for the event is www.civilservicelive.com.
Civil Service Live is part of the Cabinet Office and Dods programme of events that include the Civil Service Awards and the Civil Service Diversity and Equality Awards.

The markhor (Capra falconeri) is a large Capra species native to Central Asia, the Karakoram, and the Himalayas. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened since 2015.
The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan, where it is also known as the screw horn or screw-horned goat, mārkhor () in Urdu from Classical Persian.
Description
Markhor stand at the shoulder, are long and weigh from . They have the highest maximum shoulder height among the species in the genus Capra, but is surpassed in length and weight by the Siberian ibex. The coat is of a grizzled, light brown to black colour, and is smooth and short in summer, while growing longer and thicker in winter. The fur of the lower legs is black and white. Markhor are sexually dimorphic, with males having longer hair on the chin, throat, chest and shanks. Females are redder in colour, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head, but spread upwards toward the tips. The horns of males can grow up to long, and up to in females. The males have a pungent smell, which surpasses that of the domestic goat.
Behaviour and ecology
Markhor are adapted to mountainous terrain, and can be found between in elevation. They typically inhabit scrub forests made up primarily of oaks (Quercus ilex), pines (Pinus gerardiana), and junipers (Juniperus macropoda). They are diurnal, and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: in the spring and summer periods they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. The mating season is during winter, when the males fight each other by lunging, locking horns and attempting to push each other off balance. The gestation period lasts 135–170 days, and usually results in the birth of one or two kids, and occasionally three. Markhor live in herds, usually numbering nine animals, composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the markhor population, with adult females making up 32% and kids making up 31%. Adult males comprise 19% of the population, while subadults (males aged 2–3 years) make up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12–24 months) 9%. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above.
Predators
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Himalayan wolves (Canis lupus chanco) and brown bear (Ursus arctos) are the main predators of markhor, though golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reported to prey upon young markhor. The markhor possess keen eyesight and a strong sense of smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and on high alert; in exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators.
Taxonomy
Aegoceros (Capra) Falconeri was the scientific name proposed by Johann Andreas Wagner in 1839 based on a female specimen from the Indian Himalayas.
Multiple subspecies have been recognized, often based on horn configuration, but it has been shown that this can vary greatly even within the same population confined to one mountain range.
Astor markhor or Astore markhor (C. f. falconeri)
Bukharan markhor (C. f. heptneri)
Kabul markhor (C. f. megaceros)
Kashmir markhor (C. f. cashmiriensis)
Sulaiman markhor (C. f. jerdoni)
Astor markhor
The Astor markhor has large, flat horns, branching widely and then going up nearly straight with only a half turn. It is synonymous with Capra falconeri cashmiriensis or Pir Panjal markhor, which has heavy, flat horns, twisted like a corkscrew. The Astor markhor also has a tendency to sexually segregate outside the mating season because of multiple different mechanisms. The females are usually confined to cliffs with less forage coverage, while the males live in areas with a lot more forage coverage.
Within Afghanistan, the Astor markhor is limited to the east in the high and mountainous monsoon forests of Laghman and Nuristan. In India, this subspecies is restricted to a portion of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir. Throughout this range, Astor markhor populations are scattered, starting east of the Banihal Pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu–Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Recent surveys indicate it still occurs in catchments of the Limber and Lachipora Rivers in the Jhelum Valley Forest Division, and around Shupiyan to the south of Srinagar. In Pakistan, the Astor markhor there is restricted to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the Kunar (Chitral) River and its tributaries. Along the Indus, it inhabits both banks from Jalkot (Kohistan District) upstream to near the Tungas village (Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit up the Gilgit River, Chalt up the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley up the Astore River. It has been said to occur on the right side of the Yasin Valley (Gilgit District), though this is unconfirmed. The flare-horned markhor is also found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan, where it inhabits a number of valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River. The largest population is currently found in Chitral National Park in Pakistan.
Bukharan markhor
Although the Bukharan markhor or Tajik markhur (Capra falconeri heptneri) formerly lived in most of the mountains stretching along the north banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan, two to three scattered populations now occur in a greatly reduced distribution. It is limited to the region between lower Pyanj and the Vakhsh Rivers near Kulyab in Tajikistan (about 70"E and 37'40' to 38"N), and in the Kugitangtau Range in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (around 66'40'E and 37'30'N). This subspecies may possibly exist in the Darwaz Peninsula of northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan. Before 1979, almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution in Afghanistan, and no new information has been established in Afghanistan since that time.
Kabul markhor
The Kabul markhor has horns with a slight corkscrew, as well as a twist. A junior synonym is Capra falconeri jerdoni.
Until 1978, the Kabul markhor survived in Afghanistan only in the Kabul Gorge and the Kohe Safi area of Kapissa, and in some isolated pockets in between. It now lives the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range in the mountains of Kapissa and Kabul Provinces, after having been driven from its original habitat by intensive poaching. In Pakistan, its present range consists only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province and in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). The KPK Forest Department considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. At least 100 animals are thought to live on the Pakistani side of the Safed Koh range (Districts of Kurram and Khyber).
Relationship with the domestic goat
Certain authors have postulated that the markhor is the ancestor of some breeds of domestic goat. The Angora goat has been regarded by some as a direct descendant of the Central Asian markhor. Charles Darwin postulated that modern goats arose from crossbreeding markhor with wild goats. Evidence for markhors crossbreeding with domestic goats has been found. One study suggested that 35.7% of captive markhors in the analysis (ranging from three different zoos) had mitochondrial DNA from domestic goats. Other authors have suggested that markhor may have been the ancestor of some Egyptian goat breeds, based on their similar horns, though the lack of an anterior keel on the horns of the markhor belies any close relationship. The Changthangi domestic goat of Ladakh and Tibet may derive from the markhor. The Girgentana goat of Sicily is thought to have been bred from markhor, as is the Bilberry goat of Ireland. The Kashmiri feral herd of about 200 individuals on the Great Orme limestone headland of Wales are derived from a herd maintained at Windsor Great Park belonging to Queen Victoria.
Fecal samples taken from markhor and domestic goats indicate that there is a serious level of competition for food between the two species. The competition for food between herbivores is believed to have significantly reduced the standing crop of forage in the Himalaya–Karkoram–Hindukush ranges. Domestic livestock have an advantage over wild herbivores since the density of their herds often pushes their competitors out of the best grazing areas, and decreased forage availability has a negative effect on female fertility.
Threats
Hunting for meat as a means of subsistence or trade in wildlife parts adds to the growing problem for wildlife managers in many countries. Poaching, with its indirect impacts as disturbance, increasing fleeing distances and resulting reduction of effective habitat size, is by far the most important factor threatening the survival of the markhor population. The most important types of poachers seem to be local inhabitants, state border guards, the latter usually relying on local hunting guides, and Afghans, illegally crossing the border. Poaching causes fragmentation of the population into small islands where the remaining subpopulations are prone to extinction. The markhor is a valued trophy hunting prize for its spiral horns. The Pakistani government issued several tags in an attempt to save the species, which since the introduction of hunting the species has seen a remarkable rebound. The continuing declines of markhor populations finally caught the attention of the international community.
Hunting
In British India, markhor were considered to be among the most challenging game species, because of the danger involved in stalking and pursuing them in high, mountainous terrain. According to Arthur Brinckman in his The Rifle in Cashmere, "a man who is a good walker will never wish for any finer sport than ibex or markhoor shooting". Elliot Roosevelt wrote of how he shot two markhors in 1881, his first on 8 July, his second on 1 August. Although it is illegal to hunt markhor in Afghanistan, they have been traditionally hunted in Nuristan and Laghman Provinces, and this may have intensified during the War in Afghanistan. In Pakistan, hunting markhor is legal as part of a conservation process: expensive hunting licenses are available from the Pakistani government that allow the hunting of old markhors, which are no longer good for breeding purposes. In India, it is illegal to hunt markhor but they are poached for food and for their horns, which are thought to have medicinal properties. Markhor have also been successfully introduced to private game ranches in Texas. Unlike the aoudad, blackbuck, nilgai, ibex, and axis deer, however, markhor have not escaped in sufficient numbers to establish free-range wild populations in Texas.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources currently classifies the markhor as a near threatened species, because of its relatively small population (2013 estimate: ~5,800 individuals), the absence of a projected total population decline, and its reliance on ongoing conservation efforts to maintain population levels. There are reservations in Tajikistan to protect the markhors. In 1973, two reservations were established. The Dashtijum Strict Reserve (also called the Zapovednik in Russian) offers markhor protect across 20,000 ha. The Dashtijum Reserve (called the Zakasnik in Russian) covers 53,000 ha. Though these reserves exist to protect and conserve the markhor population, the regulations are poorly enforced making poaching common as well as habitat destruction. Although markhors still face ongoing threats, recent studies have shown considerable success with regards to the conservation approach. The approach began in the 1900s when a local hunter was convinced by a hunting tourist to stop poaching markhors. The local hunter established a conservancy that inspired two other local organizations called Morkhur and Muhofiz. The two organizations expect that their conversations will not only protect, but allow them to sustainably exploit the markhor species. This approach has been effective compared to the protection of lands that lack enforcement and security. In India, the markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir's Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978.
In culture
The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan. It was one of the 72 animals featured on the World Wide Fund for Nature Conservation Coin Collection in 1976. Markhor marionettes are used in the Afghan puppet shows known as buz-baz. The markhor has also been mentioned in a Pakistani computer-animated film known as Allahyar and the Legend of Markhor.
The markhor is present on the logo of the Inter-Services Intelligence.
Etymology
The name is thought to be derived from Persian — a conjunction of (, "snake, serpent") and the suffix (, "-eater"), interpreted to represent the animal's alleged ability to kill snakes, or as a reference to its corkscrew-like horns, which are somewhat reminiscent of coiling snakes.
In folklore the markhor is believed to kill and eat serpents. Thereafter, while chewing the cud, a foam-like substance comes out of its mouth that drops on the ground and dries. This foam-like substance is sought after by the local people, who believe it is useful in extracting the poison from snakebites.

The Mersey Forest is a network of woodlands and green spaces being created across Merseyside and North Cheshire by a wide-ranging partnership of different organisations including local authorities, community groups and businesses. The Mersey Forest is the biggest of twelve community forests covering and accessible to a local population of 1.6 million people. It stretches from Sefton to the north of Liverpool and south to Northwich in Cheshire. Delamere Forest in the south of the area being the largest area of established woodland. The forest is seen as having a major role in attracting new business and tourism to the area.
In common with the other community forests, it is not a contiguous area of forest, but rather an initiative to increase forestry coverage in an area close to urban communities. An example of this at work is Griffin Wood, clearly visible from the M62 just to the south of St. Helens. This woodland was established in 2007, including Scott's Copse, planted in recognition of the work done by David Scott.
Passengers at Liverpool's John Lennon Airport are able to offset the carbon used on their flight. The money raised is matched by the airport and used by Mersey Forest to plant new trees.
The forest falls within the area of the proposed Northern Forest.

The Passion of Anna ( – "A passion") is a 1969 Swedish drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, who was awarded Best Director at the 1970 National Society of Film Critics Awards for the film.
Plot
The audience is introduced to Andreas Winkelman, a man living alone and emotionally desolate after the recent demise of his marriage. He meets Anna, who is grieving the recent deaths of her husband and son. She uses a cane as a result of the car crash that killed them. While Anna uses Andreas' phone, he listens to her conversation, after which she departs visibly distraught. Anna has left her handbag behind and Andreas searches it, finding and reading a letter from her husband that will later prove she is deceptive.
The narrative of the film is periodically interrupted by brief footage of the actors discussing their characters.
Andreas is friends with a married couple, Eva and Elis (mutual friends of Anna) who are also in the midst of psychological turmoil. Elis is an amateur photographer who organizes his work based on emotion. Eva feels Elis has grown tired of her and has problems sleeping. One night while Elis is away, Eva visits Andreas, as she is bored and lonely. They listen to music and drink wine, which makes them drowsy, and finally Eva sleeps for several hours. When she wakes up, they have sex. Afterward, she explains that during her only pregnancy years ago, she went to the hospital to treat her insomnia. The medicine they gave her helped her condition but killed the child. She conveys that it allowed her and Elis to share a moment of emotional affinity.
Andreas visits Elis whom he promised could photograph him. Elis leaves the room for a moment and Eva enters. In their conversation, Eva reveals that Anna has moved in with Andreas, and though she is not displeased (as she likes both of them), she warns him to be wary of Anna. Elis enters the room; when Eva asks him why he looks angry, he says he only gets angry at human trifles (alluding to the affair).
Their relationship is not passionate, but Andreas and Anna start off relatively content. Anna appears zealous in her faith and steadfast in her search for truth, but gradually her delusions surface—reinforced by what Andreas read in the letter. For his part, Andreas is unable to overcome his feelings of deep humiliation about himself and remains disconnected, further dooming the relationship with Anna, as he prefers solitude and freedom to companionship.
Throughout the film, an unknown person among the island community commits acts of animal cruelty, hanging a dog and violently killing cattle. A friend of Andreas is wrongly accused of these crimes, leading the community to threaten and beat him, catalyzing his suicide. Within a few days of the friend's death, Anna and Andreas have a physical fight during which they reveal their strong distaste for each other. Afterwards, Anna lies in bed while Andreas follows two firetrucks that passed his home. They were headed to a large barn fire. When Andreas arrives, he is told that the unknown man who is the true culprit of the animal cruelty covered a barn full of animals in gasoline and lit it on fire, locking the animals in. It is obvious to the community that Andreas's friend was unjustly abused and committed suicide because of flimsy human suspicion; therefore, chances for healing are lost.
Anna shows up at the fire in her car. Andreas gets in. As they drive down the road beside the sea, Andreas explains that he desires his solitude again and that their parting will be best. He also reveals that he read the letters her husband wrote. As Andreas talks, Anna appears (to him) to speed up the car. He asks if she is going to kill him like she killed her husband and manages to stop the car safely. While Anna remains silent throughout the drive, Andreas tells her she is out of her mind and asks her to "say something" repeatedly. Eventually he asks her why she picks him up at the fire, and Anna replies "I came to ask for forgiveness." Anna drives away while Andreas paces back and forth on the side of the road.

The film has its origins in Bergman's 1968 film Shame, also starring Ullmann and Von Sydow. After shooting of Shame completed, Fårö's environmental regulations required the house built for the film be burned, but Bergman had developed an attachment to its appearance and saved it by claiming there were plans to use it in another film. He began writing The Passion of Anna, and with Von Sydow and Ullmann still contracted to work with him, envisioned The Passion of Anna as "virtually a sequel."
Themes
Author Jerry Vermilye wrote that in exploring "the thread of violence intruding on ordinary lives," Hour of the Wolf (1968), Shame and The Passion of Anna represent a trilogy. Author Amir Cohen-Shalev concurred the films form a trilogy. Cohen-Shalev wrote that, like Persona and Shame, The Passion of Anna follows an "artist as fugitive" theme touching on issues of guilt and self-hatred.
Reception
On Rotten Tomatoes, The Passion of Anna garnered 100% approval among 15 critics. Vincent Canby argued that "it does seem designed more for the indefatigable Bergman cryptologists (of which I am not one) than for interested, but uncommitted filmgoers", but praised its lead actors' performances and wrote that "Bergman gives each of them extraordinary moments of cinematic truth, monologues of sustained richness and drama". The film was included in "The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made" in 2002.
The film is not considered one of Bergman's greatest works, but retrospective evaluations are still positive. Sam Jordison wrote for Film4, "While it lacks the lightness of touch and smooth flow that distinguishes Bergman at his finest, this is still a powerful, profound work of art."
Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and included it in his Top 10 of 1970.

was a samurai during the Tokugawa shogunate, and an interpreter of Dutch and English. He studied English under Dutch merchants and Ranald MacDonald. He was called upon to assist shogunate officials during the "Manhattan Incident" of 1845, during which the American whaling ship Manhattan approached Edo to repatriate 22 castaway Japanese seamen. As Chief Dutch Interpreter, he was later one of the chief men involved in the negotiations with Commodore Perry in regard to the opening of Japan to the outside world.

The Holyland Case, named for the Holyland Park building complex in Jerusalem, was a high-profile corruption case in which top Israeli officials were charged with bribery and money laundering, among them former Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and former Mayor of Jerusalem Uri Lupolianski. Of the 13 defendants, three were acquitted and ten, including Olmert, were found guilty.
Holyland Park building complex
Holyland Towers is a complex of luxury apartment buildings in Jerusalem, along Highway 50, South of the old city. The developer is Hillel Cherny (alt.: Hillel Cherney, Hillel Charney). Before construction began in 1995, it was the site of Holyland Hotel (Eretz Hatzvi Hotel) and the open air Holyland Model of Jerusalem, now located on the grounds of the Israel Museum. When the old hotel was torn down, an archeological survey revealed a Bronze Age burial ground.
The initial plan was to replace the existing hotel with a larger one. This plan was later abandoned in favor of constructing residential housing, which required rezoning. It was the re-zoning process that led to bribery charges.
The plan includes a total of 1200 apartments. So far, one skyscraper and seven apartment towers have been built. Holyland Tower 1 (2009), a high building with 32 floors, is the highest building of Jerusalem. A similar Tower 2 is projected. In the same complex are Holyland Park Tower 1 to 7 (2004–2009), each with 15 floors. The Park Towers are connected by air bridges. The architecture is by Carmi Architects, Spector-Amisar, Tishby-Rozio Architects, and Moshe Zur Architects and Town Planners.
The buildings are visible from most places in the city. Critics have said they are ugly and intrude on the city skyline.
Early allegations
In 1996 the journalist Yoav Yitzchak claimed that Hillel Charney, the developer of the project, had obtained a false assessment of the value of the land, which had substantial tax benefits. Based on guidance from the Attorney General, a criminal investigation was launched against the Commissioner of Income Tax, Doron Levy, and his deputy Udi Barzilay. The police investigation did not result in prosecution, but forced Doron Levy to resign. A Disciplinary Committee by the Board of Valuers, which operates as a disciplinary court, opened proceedings against the assessors who were involved in the conspiracy. The two assessors were convicted.
In the summer of 2008 Yoav Yitzchak revealed additional suspicions of misconduct in the project, alleging that the developers had bribed the mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert.
This was followed by a "draft statement of claim" prepared by businessman Schmuel Dachner, who was employed as a real estate consultant and broker by the Holyland project. He claimed not to have been paid him all his expenses and fees due to him, and because his demands were not answered he prepared a "draft statement of claim" against those involved in the case, and then contacted the police regarding the matter.
Bribery investigation and indictment
This led to the opening of a police investigation. On April 6, 2010, five were arrested for suspected bribery: Hillel Charney; Meir Rabin, formerly employed by the Holyland project; Eliyahu Hasson, Holyland's accountant; Jerusalem city architect Uri Shitrit and Olmert's former partner and associate, attorney Uri Messer. A sixth suspect, Amram Benizri, was placed under house arrest. In February 2010 the prosecutor's office signed an agreement with Samuel Dachner, which awarded Dachner payment of "living wage" of 12000 shekels per month.
On January 5, 2012, the State Attorney's Office for the District Court in Tel Aviv filed an indictment against 17 defendants, on counts of giving or receiving bribes. The defendants included the prime minister and former mayor Ehud Olmert, Hillel Charney, and Avigdor Kellner, Danny Dankner the deputy chairman of Bank Hapoalim, Meir Rabin, who had worked as an assistant to Schmuel Dachner, Uri Shitrit, former Mayor of Jerusalem Uri Lupolianski, Olmert's former Chief of Staff Shula Zaken, and Jacob Efrati, who headed the Israel Lands Administration. The prosecutors said that the corruption was not an isolated incident, but was part of established business practice, with bribery being used to subvert the planning process by changing zoning laws, overcoming opposition by citizens' groups and enabling violations of construction and pollution regulations.
Trial
The evidence phase began on 1 July 2012 with the testimony of Schmuel Dachner that he had given money to Shula Zaken. Dachner died on March 1, 2013, several hours after he was cross-examined. Four days after his death his full name was revealed: (until then he was referred to by his initials, SD). Yossi Olmert, brother of Ehud Olmert, confirmed that Samuel Dachner gave him half a million. A few days before giving the verdict in the case, the State Attorney signed a plea bargain with Zaken, sentencing her to 11 months in prison in exchange for the delivery of evidence and incriminating evidence against Olmert.
On March 31, 2014, at the end of a trial involving 140 sessions held over two years, Tel Aviv District Court judge David Rosen convicted 10 of the 13 accused and acquitted Yaakov Efrati, the Israel Lands Administration, Amnon Safran and Shimon Galon, former executives at Holyland Park.
Ehud Olmert was convicted of receiving NIS 560,000 ($160,000 US) in bribes. Olmert was acquitted of two other charges of bribery. The judge rejected Olmert's version of events, declaring that he had lied to the court. Sentence: 6–8 years in jail, and one million NIS fine.
Shula Zaken was convicted of all charges of receiving bribes totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars as well as of money laundering, and was acquitted only of the count of receiving a bribe of ten thousand shekels. Sentence: 11–41 months in jail, fine 25 thousand NIS, 75 thousand Nisses confiscated.
Uri Lupolianski was convicted of accepting bribes totaling more than NIS 2 million.
Avigdor Kelner, founder of "Holyland Park", was convicted of money laundering and giving bribery. Sentence: 3 years in jail, fine a million NIS and half a million confiscated.
Hillel Charney, with the Holyland project, who hired Dachner to promote the project, was convicted of bribing Olmert, Shula Zaken and former mayor Uri Lupolianski and also of money laundering. Sentence: 3.5–5 years in jail, fine a million NIS, and a million confiscated.
Meir Rabin, who was the principal assistant of witness Schmuel Dachner, was convicted of money laundering and bribery of 1.2 million NIS. Sentence: 5 years in jail.
Uri Sheetrit, former Jerusalem city engineer, was convicted of accepting a bribe of NIS 130,000 from Dachner and money laundering.
Danny Dankner was convicted of bribery, falsifying corporate documents and money laundering.
Eliezer Simchayof, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, was convicted of accepting bribes from Dachner totaling NIS 165,000, and acquitted of accepting bribes totaling NIS 130,000.
Avraham Feiner, a member of the Jerusalem City Council, was convicted of accepting a bribe of NIS 680,000.
Hillel Cherney was sentenced to 3.5 years,

The whiskered yuhina (Yuhina flavicollis) is a bird species in the white-eye family Zosteropidae. Its range extends across the Himalayan forests in northern India to northeast Indian states, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and in the east to Indochina including Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. The whiskered yuhina is sometimes found in mixed hunting parties with other yuhina and fulvetta species, but it has also been reported to not associate with mixed hunting parties in some areas. It is described as one of the commonest yuhinas in the Himalayas, although it is relatively uncommon to rare at low elevations. It prefers relatively undisturbed closed canopy cover. It is one among several other birds hunted by livestock herders in Northeast India.

William S. Gaither (December 3, 1932 – September 11, 2009) was a civil engineer and former president of Drexel University.
Academic background
Gaither studied civil engineering at the Rose Polytechnic Institute (now the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology), graduating in 1956. Before continuing with his graduate education he worked for the Meyer Corporation, the Dravo Corporation, and the Bechtel Corporation as an engineer. In 1964 he received a Ph.D. from Princeton University concentrating his work on marine transportation and ocean engineering.
Career
Gaither taught at Princeton University and the University of Florida.
In 1967 he started an ocean engineering program at the University of Delaware. In 1970 he was offered the position of dean and professor of the College of Marine Studies at Delaware, where he was also the Sea Grant program director. This program is an organization which honors colleges that have developed a curriculum for studying the oceans and human impact on them. During his career he frequently testified to Congress on environmental and oceanographic issues.
In May 1984 he left the University of Delaware for the position of President of Drexel University. He was officially he was installed into the position on April 27, 1985. While at Drexel he created eleven new majors and increased alumni giving. He also worked on programs to enhance minority student enrollment at Drexel. During his tenure at Drexel he was on the boards of the University City Science Center, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Delaware Council, and the West Philadelphia Partnership.
On April 22, 1987, a Drexel employee filed a sexual harassment complaint against Gaither stating that he had sexually harassed her at a business dinner. Following the incident, faculty vote resulted in a motion of "no confidence" in Gaither. Upon review of the situation and an investigation into other sexual harassment allegations, the Drexel board of trustees overturned the vote of no confidence and did not ask Gaither for his resignation. In October of that year, following continual turmoil on campus due to the incident, Gaither resigned stating that "While I am fully prepared and wish to continue as president of this fine institution, it is my considered judgment that to do so will not serve the best interests of the university."

Detritivores (also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters) are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). The terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably, but they describe different organisms. Detritivores are usually arthropods and help in the process of remineralization. Detritivores perform the first stage of remineralization, by fragmenting the dead plant matter, allowing decomposers to perform the second stage of remineralization.
Plant tissues are made up of resilient molecules (cellulose, chitin, lignin and xylan) that decay at a much lower rate than other organic molecules. The activity of detritivores are the reason why we do not see an accumulation of plant litter in nature.
Detritivores are an important aspect of many ecosystems. They can live on any type of soil with an organic component, including marine ecosystems, where they are termed interchangeably with bottom feeders.
Typical detritivorous animals include millipedes, springtails, woodlice, dung flies, slugs, many terrestrial worms, sea stars, sea cucumbers, fiddler crabs, and some sedentary polychaetes such as worms of the family Terebellidae.
Detritivores can be classified into more specific groups based on their size and biomes. Macrodetritivores are larger organisms such as millipedes, springtails, and woodlouse, while microdetritivores are smaller organisms such as bacteria.
Scavengers are not typically thought to be detritivores, as they generally eat large quantities of organic matter, but both detritivores and scavengers are the same type of cases of consumer-resource systems. The consumption of wood, whether alive or dead, is known as xylophagy. The activity of animals feeding only on dead wood is called sapro-xylophagy and those animals, sapro-xylophagous.
Ecology
Detritivores play an important role as recyclers in the ecosystem's energy flow and biogeochemical cycles. Especially in the role of recycling nutrients back into the soil. Detritivores and decomposers reintroduce vital elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium back into the soil, allowing plants to take in these elements and use them for growth. They shred the dead plant matter which releases the trapped nutrients in the plant tissues. An abundance of detritivores in the soil allow the ecosystem to efficiently recycle nutrients.
Detritivore feeding behaviour is affected by rainfall; moist soil increases detritivore feeding and excretion.
Many detritivores live in mature woodland, though the term can be applied to certain bottom-feeders in wet environments. These organisms play a crucial role in benthic ecosystems, forming essential food chains and participating in the nitrogen cycle. Detritivores and decompsers that reside in the desert are burrowed underground to avoid the hot surface and underground conditions provide favorable living conditions for them. Detritivores are the main organisms in clearing plant litter and recycling nutrients in the desert. Due to the limited vegetation available in the desert and desert detritivores adapted and evolved ways to feed in the extreme conditions of the desert.
Fungi, acting as decomposers, are important in today's terrestrial environment. During the Carboniferous period, fungi and bacteria had yet to evolve the capacity to digest lignin, and so large deposits of dead plant tissue accumulated during this period, later becoming the fossil fuels.
By feeding on sediments directly to extract the organic component, some detritivores incidentally concentrate toxic pollutants.

Moonbathers is the fifth studio album by the Dutch symphonic metal band Delain. It was released on 26 August 2016 worldwide.
It features one guest appearance from Alissa White-Gluz. Just like We Are the Others, this album does not feature Marko Hietala. It is the only studio album with Ruben Israel on drums and Merel Bechtold on rhythm guitar.
Background
According to lead singer Charlotte Wessels, the lyrics on the album have a theme of death. This was unintentional and she only realized this after reviewing the lyrics she had written. Wessels has said that the title of the album comes from the idea that "Even in a dark place, there can also be that comfort in the dark." The songs "Danse Macabre" and "Chrysalis (The Last Breath)" were inspired by a film script, however she didn't specify which one.
"Scandal" is a Queen cover.
"Turn the Lights Out" was inspired by DC comic series "The Sandman" by Neil Gaiman.
"Hands of Gold" contains fragments of "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" by Oscar Wilde.
"Suckerpunch" and "Turn the Lights Out" were previously released on Lunar Prelude.

Polyrock was an American post-punk/new wave band formed in New York City in 1978 and active until the mid-1980s. Strongly influenced by minimalism, the group was produced by the composer Philip Glass and Kurt Munkacsi. The band, led by singer/guitarist Billy Robertson (formerly of the group Model Citizens), had a keyboard-heavy, pattern-based sound strongly reminiscent of Glass's work; in fact, Glass performed on their first two albums.
Polyrock's lineup also included vocalist Catherine Oblasney, guitarist Tommy Robertson, drummer Joseph Yannece, keyboard player Lenny Aaron, and Curt Cosentino. The group signed with RCA by 1980, and delivered their debut album that same year. Another album followed in 1981 (Changing Hearts), but Polyrock disbanded in 1983. The band is sometimes said to have released another album in 1981 (Electro-Romantic), but, apparently, no such album exists.
They were often compared by critics to Talking Heads, another band of the same era, though they never approached that band's fame.
In 1990, Billy Robertson and Catherine Oblasney formed the group 9 Ways to Sunday and released a self-titled album.
Robertson died in September 2018. A memorial was held September 24, 2018, at the Brooklyn Ice House bar in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, near where Robertson lived.

The Jacksonville Developmental Center was an institution for developmentally delayed clients, located in Jacksonville, Illinois. It was open from 1851 to November 2012. , the grounds was still owned by the State of Illinois.
History
Illinois originally did not have any system for caring for its mentally ill citizens who were either living with their family or kept in local almshouses.
Dorothea Dix lobbied the state legislature to create a facility in Illinois designed for the care of the mentally ill. On March 1, 1847, the legislature established the Illinois State Asylum and Hospital for the Insane with a nine-member board of trustees that was empowered to appoint a superintendent, purchase land within four miles of Jacksonville, and construct facilities. (L. 1847, p. 52). At the time, only two other states had state-operated facilities for the mentally ill. The hospital was created to shift the economic burden of the mentally ill onto the state, which paid all of the patients' expenses. However, patients (or their county of residence) remained responsible for transportation, clothing and incidentals.
At the time, institutions for the mentally ill either had a number of small cottages, or a single large central building under the Kirkbride Plan. The trustees selected Kirkbride's approach for the new institution. The center building was five and a half stories high, with two separate wings for each gender extending with staggered setbacks from the center. In 1984, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, although it was demolished in the 1970s.
Construction of the buildings was begun in 1848 and James M. Higgins was hired as Superintendent. Although Dix had expressed interest that Jacksonville State Hospital be opened by 1849, it wasn't until November 3, 1851, that the first two wards were ready for occupancy and the first patient, Sophronia McElhiney, of McLean County, was admitted.
In 1860, Elizabeth P.W. Packard's husband had her committed to Jacksonville against her will, due to a disagreement over her religious beliefs. At the time, Illinois law (which was enacted when the hospital opened) had an exception to its commitment hearing requirement to allow husbands to confine their wives to an asylum without any hearing. After three years, she was discharge from the hospital. Her husband then imprisoned her in their home, and after gaining her freedom through a lawsuit, she formed the Anti-Insane Asylum Society. She led a campaign to amend the Illinois law to guarantee a public hearing for all people declared insane, including women whose husbands wished to have them committed. She also saw similar laws passed in three other states.
Jacksonville remained Illinois' only such hospital until two additional facilities, the hospital at Elgin and the hospital at Anna, were authorized in 1869, and the legislature renamed Jacksonville as the Illinois Central Hospital for the Insane, assumed primary responsibility for patients from the counties of central Illinois. As a part of this reorganization, the legislature also reduced the size of Jacksonville's board of trustees to three members and they newly created a new statewide Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities to supervise all state institutions while each one retained its own separate board.
When the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities was abolished in 1909, the institute was reorganized and renamed Jacksonville State Hospital effective January 1, 1910. In 1917, the Department of Public Welfare assumed responsibility for Jacksonville State Hospital and retained control until the creation of the Illinois Department of Mental Health in 1961 (L. 1961, p. 2666).
From 1944 to 1974, the hospital provided training in psychiatric nursing for students from general hospital nursing schools. Jacksonville's Psychiatric Nursing Affiliation Program, which was headed by the State Alienist.
In 1974, Jacksonville State Hospital's duties expanded beyond in-patient care of mental illness to include treatment for the *developmentally disabled." To reflect this change in mission, the legislature renamed it the Jacksonville Mental Health and Developmental Center' in 1975. (P.A. 79-581, p. 1895.) Jacksonville phased out its in-patient treatment of mental illness and its name was changed one last time to reflect its new mission.
Final years
When closed, the Jacksonville Developmental Center treated primarily developmentally delayed patients, some of whom also had mental illnesses. The center was operated by the Illinois Department of Human Services.
, Jacksonville had 400 employees and an appropriation of $30,107,300.
In September 2011, Governor Pat Quinn announced a plan to close the facility in February 2012 due to budget issues.
The last residents were moved out in late November 2012.

The Second Battle of Lincoln occurred at Lincoln Castle on Saturday 20 May 1217, during the First Barons' War, between the forces of the future Louis VIII of France and those of King Henry III of England. Louis's forces were attacked by a relief force under the command of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Thomas, Count of Perche, commanding the French troops, was killed and Louis was expelled from his base in the southeast of England. The looting that took place afterwards is known as the "Lincoln Fair". The citizens of Lincoln were loyal to Louis so Henry's forces sacked the city.
Background
In 1216, during the First Barons' War over the English succession, Prince Louis of France entered London and proclaimed himself King of England. Louis was supported by various English barons who resisted the rule of King John. John died in the middle of the war, and his nine-year-old son Henry III was crowned King of England as successor to his father.
Once John died, many barons were willing to change sides and fight for Henry against Prince Louis' claim. William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, a knight of great skill and prowess, served as regent for Henry. Marshal called all nobles holding castles in England to a muster in Newark. Approximately 400 knights, 250 crossbowmen, and a larger auxiliary force of both mounted and foot soldiers were assembled. Marshal marched his forces to the city of Lincoln to break Prince Louis's siege.
Battlefield
Medieval Lincoln was an ancient walled city with a Norman castle near its centre, straddling the crossroads of two important Roman-built highways: Ermine Street and the Fosse Way. These trans-England routes were historic and major arteries for national trade and government, making Lincoln a strategic location. William the Conqueror had ordered the construction of Lincoln Castle on a hilltop over an old Roman fort 150 years earlier.
At the time of the battle in May 1217, Louis's forces had taken the city of Lincoln, but Lincoln Castle remained intact. Its garrison, commanded by castellan Nichola de la Haye, was loyal to King Henry and continued to defend the important fortification from forces loyal to Prince Louis, led by Thomas, the Count of Perche.
Battle
Marshal's forces made their approach from the town of Stow, a few miles northwest of Lincoln. The advance was known to Thomas, Count of Perche, but his knights were uncertain as to the enemy's strength. Two strategies were formed. Those who believed Marshal's force was relatively small in number favoured an offensive plan: a meeting in an open battlefield at the base of the hill, before Marshal could reach the city gates. Those who believed Marshal had a dangerously large force favoured a more defensive plan: delay Marshal at the gates of the city wall, and at the same time press the siege, capture the castle, and occupy this much stronger position. The defensive plan was taken, though not without some continuing dissension.
Marshal proceeded to the section of the city walls nearest the castle, at the north gate. All of Marshal's crossbowmen, led by the nobleman Falkes de Breauté, assaulted and took the gate. Perche's forces did not respond, but continued the castle siege.
Marshal's main force secured the north gate, while Breauté's crossbowmen took up high positions on the rooftops of houses. Volleys of bolts from this high ground rained death, damage and confusion on Perche's forces. Then, in the final blow, Marshal's knights and footsoldiers charged Perche's siege forces. Perche was offered a surrender, but fought to the death as the siege collapsed into a scattered rout. Those of Louis's army who were not captured fled Lincoln, by the south city gate, to London. The battle took about six hours.
Aftermath and effects
The city of Lincoln was pillaged by Marshal's victorious army, on the pretence that it was loyal to Louis, later euphemistically called 'the Lincoln Fair'. To the south, inhabitants of towns between Lincoln and London ambushed and killed some of the escaping French soldiers on their flight south to London.
The Battle of Lincoln was the turning point in the First Barons' War. Many of Henry's enemies – barons who had supported Louis, and who helped supply, organise and command Louis's military forces – were captured at Lincoln. French reinforcements, under the command of Eustace the Monk, were then sent across the English Channel to bolster Louis's forces. The French ships were defeated by Hubert de Burgh in the Battle of Dover. This defeat greatly reduced the French threat to the English crown and Prince Louis and his remaining forces returned to France. In September 1217, the Treaty of Lambeth forced Louis to give up his claim to the English throne and to eject Eustace's brothers from the Channel Islands.

Vitali Klitschko vs. Corrie Sanders, billed as Let the Next Era Begin, was a professional boxing match contested on 24 April 2004 for the WBC Heavyweight Championship.
Background
After his TKO loss to Lennox Lewis in June 2003 Vitali Klitschko first sort out an immediate rematch, however after some initial interest Lewis ultimately declined, deciding not to fight for the rest of 2003. As a result, Klitschko faced Kirk Johnson in a WBC Heavyweight Title Eliminator stopping him in 2 rounds making him Lewis's mandatory contender.
In January 2004 Lewis announced his retirement from boxing leaving the WBC belt vacant.
Corrie Sanders caused the Upset of the Year in 2003 when he knocked out Vitali's younger brother Klitschko to win the WBO belt. After vacating the belt he agreed to face Vitali for the now vacant WBC title.
Going into the fight Vitali Klitschko was ranked as the best Heavyweight in the world by Ring magazine (Corrie Sanders was 3rd).
The fight
The fight proved to be slugfest with Sanders landing some big left hands on Vitali, but the bigger man was throwing and landing more punches.
By the eighth round Sanders was bleeding and looking worn out, he managed a last flurry which briefly troubled Klitschko, before a straight right halted the attack. Referee John Schorle stepped in towards the end of round after Sanders took a string of 20 unanswered punches giving Klitschko a TKO victory.
According to CompuBox Klitschko landed 230 punches with 56% accuracy, against Sanders's 51 punches with 22% accuracy. There were no knockdowns
Aftermath
Sanders was taken to a hospital for a hematoma of his left ear however his manager, Vernon Smith, said "He's all right; he's cracking jokes. He took quite a shot behind the left ear. He was exhausted, he was tired. He did not disagree with the referee's decision. He got beaten by a better fighter."
Klitschko praised Sanders durability saying "I was surprised he never went down. He took so many punches it was unbelievable."
After Sanders' death in 2012 Vitali praised him to Bild Plus saying “Corrie Sanders was the most difficult opponent I ever fought. Corrie was fast, could give and take a punch. His style was dangerous and did not suit me. I was very pleased to be able to win this fight.”

Finlay MacDonald (born 1978) is a Scottish musician and composer. He was one of the first pipers to receive a BA in Scottish music and piping from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.
MacDonald is head of piping studies at the National Piping Centre in Glasgow. He founded his own band The Finlay MacDonald Band, which toured between 2006 and 2007 to highly positive reviews, though in recent years they have been inactive. Annually he works with Roddy MacLeod to organise the Piping Live! Festival.
He performed with Jay-Z, P Diddy and Alicia Keys in 2010 and later with Bryan Adams at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
As well as musical collaborations and performances, MacDonald appeared in the Michael Keaton film A Shot at Glory.
In 2012, MacDonald was the co-star with Alastair Campbell in a Sky Arts documentary, First Love, in which he taught the former Labour Party strategist, who had learned the pipes as a child, to prepare for a major solo piping performance at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow. The experience rekindled Campbell's love of piping, and MacDonald has since become his tutor, and the pair have performed together at a number of events, including anti-Brexit rallies.

Stimmen Reste (English: Voice Remainders) is the seventh release of Einstürzende Neubauten's Musterhaus project, a series of highly experimental CD releases that were only available via an annual subscription through their website or from shows during their 25th Anniversary Tour. This project was separate from their Neubauten.org Supporter Project, which it ran concurrent to.
The focus of this Musterhaus release is manipulation and experimentation of leftover vocal recordings from earlier projects that were either not previously released ("Gestern"), or have never been properly recorded ("Semiotische Musik #5"). Enhancing them are some leftover recordings of polystyrene, electronic pulses, hammond organs, bass guitar, and metal percussions that also fell to the side.

The q-exponential distribution is a probability distribution arising from the maximization of the Tsallis entropy under appropriate constraints, including constraining the domain to be positive. It is one example of a Tsallis distribution. The q-exponential is a generalization of the exponential distribution in the same way that Tsallis entropy is a generalization of standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy or Shannon entropy. The exponential distribution is recovered as
Originally proposed by the statisticians George Box and David Cox in 1964, and known as the reverse Box–Cox transformation for a particular case of power transform in statistics.
Characterization
Probability density function
The q-exponential distribution has the probability density function
where
is the q-exponential if . When , eq(x) is just exp(x).
Derivation
In a similar procedure to how the exponential distribution can be derived (using the standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy or Shannon entropy and constraining the domain of the variable to be positive), the q-exponential distribution can be derived from a maximization of the Tsallis Entropy subject to the appropriate constraints.
Relationship to other distributions
The q-exponential is a special case of the generalized Pareto distribution where
The q-exponential is the generalization of the Lomax distribution (Pareto Type II), as it extends this distribution to the cases of finite support. The Lomax parameters are:
As the Lomax distribution is a shifted version of the Pareto distribution, the q-exponential is a shifted reparameterized generalization of the Pareto. When , the q-exponential is equivalent to the Pareto shifted to have support starting at zero. Specifically, if
then
Generating random deviates
Random deviates can be drawn using inverse transform sampling. Given a variable U that is uniformly distributed on the interval (0,1), then
where is the q-logarithm and
Applications
Being a power transform, it is a usual technique in statistics for stabilizing the variance, making the data more normal distribution-like and improving the validity of measures of association such as the Pearson correlation between variables.
It has been found to be an accurate model for train delays.
It is also found in atomic physics and quantum optics, for example processes of molecular condensate creation via transition through the Feshbach resonance.

Early career
2001 – reached final at ITF Hvar/CRO
2002 – reached final at ITF Sopron/HUN
2003 – won first ITF Circuit title at ITF Yamaguchi/JPN; also reached final at ITF Makarska/CRO
2004 – best career finish, reaching quarterfinals at Budapest. Mamić, ranked world No. 201, entered the main draw as a qualifier. Budapest was her WTA Tour main-draw debut, whereupon she defeated Gala León García and Tathiana Garbin en route, eventually losing to Flavia Pennetta in three sets.
In Seoul, she qualified and lost again, in the quarterfinals to Anne Kremer.
After qualifying at Moscow, Mamić notched her best win versus world No. 28, Mary Pierce, winning 6–0, 6–4 before losing to Elena Dementieva.
In May 2004, Mamić had her Grand Slam debut, reaching the main draw at the French Open through qualifying. She would lose in the first round.
Later in the year, she had her top-100 debut on 18 October at world No. 96, reaching career-high at the time to world No. 95 a week later.
In 2005, Mamić reached third singles quarterfinal at Modena, losing in a third-set tiebreaker to eventual finalist Garbin.
She managed to reach the second round four times, including Rome, where she defeated world No. 23, Daniela Hantuchová, and later losing to Pierce, and the French Open, where she eventually lost in the second round to Dementieva.
During the rest of the year, she lost in the first round six times, including the other three Grand Slam tournaments.
In September, she was invited to Croatian Fed Cup team for their match against Thailand. Although she lost both singles rubbers to Tamarine Tanasugarn and Suchanan Viratprasert, Croatia prevailed 3–2.
Late career
Later in her career, Mamić had problems with her wrist, which at first was thought to be a regular sport injury requiring only a short term break. Her ranking was protected for the next ten months. But further complications with her injury, talk about a mysterious bacterium that infected her wrist wound, and liver complications took her off the courts for more than two years. Her tennis career seemed almost over, and she moved on and started to work for a web design company.
But in 2008, she came back to the courts. Her comeback began at the Bangalore Open in March where she won her first-round match against Chan Yung-jan (6–2, 6–2), but lost in the second round to then-No. 1 in the world, Jelena Janković (2–6, 2–6).
Mamić reached the second round in her Grand Slam comeback at the French Open, beating Michaëlla Krajicek (6–4, 6–3) before falling to Francesca Schiavone.

}}Quit the Curse is the debut studio album by American musician Anna Burch. It was released on February 2, 2018 under Polyvinyl Record Co.
Critical receptionQuit the Curse was met with "generally favorable" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 75, based on 10 reviews Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 73 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 12 reviews.
Erin Bashford from Dork'' said of the album: "the record plays with folk and country alongside its indie rock roots. Anna has polished her brand of soft, saccharine, harmonic indie rock, and with that, presents these nine songs as a modern tale of cities and people. [The album] is a cogently written record, characterised by its barbed lyrics and dreamy instrumental." Susan Darlington from Loud and Quiet said: "Smart without giving the impression of trying too hard, Burch's debut is full of subtle ear-worms and a lyrical intimacy that makes her the girl you want to hang out with at college."

The Tiroler Volkspartei (English: Tyrolean People's Party) is the Tirol branch of the Austrian People's Party.
The party was formed through a merger of the rival Christian Social Party and the Catholic Conservatives on October 27, 1918. After winning the first provincial legislative election in 1919, the Tiroler Volkspartei remained the most powerful party until the end of the First Austrian Republic. Within the party, the Tiroler Bauernbund (Farmers league) formed the largest and most influential group.
In the area of South Tyrol, which had been annexed to Italy, the Tiroler Volkspartei joined in a coalition with the Deutschfreiheitliche Partei called the Deutscher Verband. This coalition won 90% of the vote and sent four representatives to the Chamber of Deputies. However, the party lost its influence after the March on Rome in October 1922.
After 1945, the Tiroler Volkspartei became the state organization of the Austrian People's Party. It has remained the majority party in the provincial Landtag ever since, except for the years 1999 to 2008.

A Hot Country (published as Love and Death in a Hot Country in the US) was the last novel to be written by Shiva Naipaul and also his shortest in length. It was published in 1983.
Before its publication, Naipaul had not written a novel in ten years. A Hot Country departs from the comic style of his earlier novels Fireflies and The Chip-Chip Gatherers.
It is set during an election in the fictional Caribbean country of Cuyama, thought to be based on Guyana where Naipaul had researched his book Black & White about the Jonestown Massacre, which profoundly affected him.

Seth Joshua (10 April 1858 – 21 May 1925), was a Welsh Presbyterian minister and Evangelist who was noted for his influence before during and after the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival as well as for being a direct influence on the ministry of Evan Roberts, one of the leading figures of that revival.
Personal life
Born in Tŷ Capel, Pontypool, Wales, Seth Joshua was son of George and Mary Joshua. He had a younger brother, Francis (Frank) James Joshua, who was also a Presbyterian Minister. He married Mary Rees from Llantrisant, in 1883, and they had eight children. His son Peter, was a minister and a popular evangelist in the United States; another son, Lyn, was credited with Mai Jones and Jimmy Harper for the Welsh standard "We'll Keep a Welcome".
Ministry
Joshua, along with his brother, Frank, founded Mission Hall cause in Neath. He was a noted evangelist, travelling around Britain and visiting U.S.A. In 1893 he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister and worked with the Forward Movement, a branch of the Connexion's Home Mission, establishing evangelising centres in Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire.
Seth Joshua was a forerunner of the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival which began as a movement of prayer. Joshua had been praying for years that God would raise up a young man from the pits to revive the churches. In 1904, he preached at a meeting in Newcastle Emlyn which students from the Methodist Academy attended including former mine worker, Evan Roberts. The students were so moved that they cancelled classes to go to Blaenanerch where Joshua prayed publicly, O God, bend us. Evan Roberts went forward where he prayed with great agony, O God, bend me.
In October 1905, Joshua, was invited to hold a mission in London. Only three were "saved", Donald Gee, the English Pentecostal Bible teacher, being one of them.

Lancaster Academy is a co-educational secondary school located in Knighton, Leicester, England.
History
On 1 September 2000 Lancaster School acquired specialist sports college status one of only four schools in the East Midlands to have achieved this designation at that time.
In January 2007, the school alongside Sir Jonathon North Community College added a jointly owned £1.6 million four court indoor tennis centre to accompany its six floodlit outdoor tennis courts, multi-use games area, two gymnasiums and field
During the 2006/2007 school term, the School was featured in the BBC Two documentary series The Choir: Boys Don't Sing, in which choir master Gareth Malone started a student and staff choir and took them to perform at the Royal Albert Hall which was aired during February 2008.
In January 2014, the school opened a new building costing £13 million which consisted of new science, maths and IT departments alongside a state of the art dinner atrium and a new kitchen to replace the ageing buildings which had been in use since the early 1970's.
During early 2015 Mr R Kennedy left his position as Headteacher with Mrs Anna Fisher stepping up in as interim Headteacher of the school.
In 2016 a published report showed the school was in £1 million of debt.
During 2017 the school became an academy in partnership with The Learning without Limits Academy trust who also operate Babington Academy in Beaumont Leys.

B.O.B. (known in Japan as Space Funky B.O.B.) is a video game that was released in 1993. It is a side-scrolling game, a 2D shooter and a platform game. A sequel, B.O.B. II, was in development but never released.
Gameplay
The player can choose from a wide variety of weapons and gadgets called "remotes", each with their own ammunition or stock. Use of remotes, such as a trampoline or helicopter, is necessary to complete some stages. A punch is also available when ammunition for B.O.B.'s gun runs out, or if the player wishes to conserve it. There is a time limit on every stage and once it runs out the player loses a life.
B.O.B. uses the same game engine as the Wayne's World video game, also developed by Gray Matter. Elements of the shooting, jumping, and boss battles are very similar between the two games.
Plot
When B.O.B. crashes his dad's space car on the way to pick up his date, he finds himself stranded on a hostile asteroid filled with enemies. By collecting Thiagotch's and using fast reflexes, B.O.B. tries to find his way off the asteroid and to his date. B.O.B. fights his way through three strange worlds in total, encountering several particularly enormous or swift enemies (bosses) along the way, and participating in several cart-race levels. There were several different types of setting for each level, including domed space colony cities, large alien hive-type areas, strange biomechanical facilities, ancient (and apparently haunted) temples and cavernous magma chambers. Some of these settings only appeared on certain worlds.
At the end of each world, B.O.B manages to discover a new space-car to allow him to continue on his journey. The first two both fail him under comical circumstances, resulting in him becoming trapped on an entirely new alien world. With the final car, B.O.B. is at last able to meet up with his date, who is revealed to be a large, blue female robot with a huge mouth, who harshly berates B.O.B. for his tardiness. As she is yelling at him, a slender red female robot flies past them on a space surfboard. B.O.B., frustrated with his obnoxious date, declares "That's the girl for me!" and drives off in pursuit of the red female. The game ends with a shot of B.O.B. and his new date sitting on a small asteroid together, staring out at the beauty of the cosmos in silence. Behind them, B.O.B.'s car (in the backseat of which his date had stashed her surfboard) stalls and drifts off into space, presumably leaving them stranded together but neither of the lovers seem to notice.
Development
B.O.B. was developed by Gray Matter Inc. and Foley Hi-Tech Systems, and published by Electronic Arts for both the Super NES and Genesis. The cover art for the EA packaging was illustrated by Marc Ericksen.
In August 2006, GameSpot reported that Electronic Arts would be also porting B.O.B. to the PlayStation Portable as part of EA Replay. It was released in North America on November 7, 2006.
On September 12, 2008 the source code of the SNES version became available as it was found on an eBay-bought hard drive.
Reception
Super Gamer gave B.O.B. an overall review score of 60%

"Serpentine Fire" is a single by Earth, Wind & Fire which was issued in October 1977 by Columbia Records. The single rose to numbers 1 and 13 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively.
Overview
"Serpentine Fire" spent seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and was named the R&B single of the year by Billboard. The song was produced by bandleader Maurice White for Kalimba Productions and arranged by Tom Tom 84. "Serpentine Fire" was composed by Maurice, Verdine White and Reginald 'Sonny' Burke. An instrumental version of "Serpentine Fire" was the b-side of this single. "Serpentine Fire" came off of EWF's 1977 album All 'n All.
During October 1977, the music video for "Serpentine Fire" was issued by Columbia.
Critical reception
The Guardian declared "songs such as Serpentine Fire and Jupiter run on sheer adrenaline". Ed Hogan of AllMusic called the tune "a poppin mid-tempo jam". Joe McEwen of Rolling Stone exclaimed "Serpentine Fire, a song about the spinal life-center philosophy of many Eastern religions, is a simple tango spiced by a subtle funk base and the incessant clanging of a cowbell." Phyl Garland of Stereo Review also described the song as "a high stepper guaranteed to set even the most sluggish soul into motion".

Nathan East version featuring Philip Bailey, Verdine White and Ralph Johnson
In December 2016, bass guitarist Nathan East released a cover of "Serpentine Fire" featuring Philip Bailey, Verdine White and Ralph Johnson as a single via Yamaha Entertainment Group. The song reached No. 17 on the Billboard Smooth Jazz Songs chart.
Critical reception
Andy Kellman of AllMusic proclaimed "Serpentine Fire" gets an ornate update with Bailey and EW&F partners Verdine White and Ralph Johnson. Phil Collins' drums and Eric Clapton's guitar are dredged from the master recording of an abandoned project, lost for 25 years, that was found in Patti Austin's basement by East's engineer."
Charts
Other covers
"Serpentine Fire" has also been covered by artists such as Jimmy Smith on his 1978 album Unfinished Business and Tom Scott on his 1990 album Them Changes. Brian Culbertson covered the song on his 2003 album Come On Up and Jack DeJohnette recorded another version with Ravi Coltrane and Matthew Garrison for his 2015 album In Movement.

Woodhouse, often known to locals as Old Woodhouse, is a small village and civil parish in the heart of Charnwood, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 2,319, including around 300 term-time boarders at the Defence College. The parish includes the larger village of Woodhouse Eaves. The parish of Woodhouse was formed in 1844. The village is located between the larger Woodhouse Eaves and Quorn villages, the village contains a mixture of small cottages and large modern houses. It is a commuter village for both Leicester and Loughborough, as well as further afield.
Beaumanor Hall, ancestral home of the Herrick family, was used as a listening station during the war, and intercepted signals intelligence for Bletchley Park. The Hall is now owned by Leicestershire County Council and is used as an educational base with outdoor activities.
In 2005 Welbeck College moved to the village, on the edge of the grounds of Beaumanor Hall.
The village has 130 homes and around 400 people living in it.
The oldest part of the village is the church, St Mary-in-the-Elms, which dates back to the 15th century with 17th and 19th century renovations. On the side of the church near to where the Herrick family are buried are a number of old indentations showing where arrows were sharpened for hunting. The village was originally linear; however, the army barracks created a more nucleated village with more modern housing than the typical Georgian architecture seen throughout.
The village has no services and relies on surrounding villages and towns for shops etc. The village is low on the settlement hierarchy.
The Martin family
The most famous past residents of Woodhouse include the Martin family, formerly of Anstey, Leicestershire, who gave their name to the Anstey Martin High School and were once an extremely powerful family in Leicester. They left Anstey and moved into the Brand. Col Sir Robert Andrew Martin, who lived at The Brand, was Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire from 1965 to 1989 and a distinguished soldier.

Julius "Nipsey" Russell (September 15, 1918 – October 2, 2005) was an American actor, comedian, poet, and dancer best known for his appearances as a panelist on game shows from the 1960s through the 1990s, including Match Game, Password, Hollywood Squares, To Tell the Truth, and Pyramid. His appearances were often distinguished by short, humorous poems he recited during the broadcast, which led to his nickname "the poet laureate of television". He had one of the leading roles in the film version of The Wiz as the Tin Man. He was a frequent guest on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast series and often appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien during the program's early years.
Early life
Julius Russell was born in Atlanta, Georgia. His birthdate is unclear; according to one report his birth certificate was lost. At the time of his 2005 death, friends said he was 80, and that was the age reported in his obituaries. That implies a birth year of 1924 or 1925; the New York Times obituary gave his birthdate as October 13, 1924. Federal records suggest that he was born in 1918: Census documents record a Julius Russell in Atlanta aged 1 year 4 months in 1920, consistent with a birthdate in late 1918. The Social Security Death Index lists his birthdate as September 15, 1918.
He acquired the nickname "Nipsey" from his mother who liked the way it sounded.
He went to Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta, then moved to Cincinnati to live with an aunt during his senior year so that he could establish residency to attend the University of Cincinnati tuition-free. He attended the University of Cincinnati for one semester in 1936, which is also consistent with a birthdate of 1918, as he would have been 18 and not merely 11 or 12, as he would have been if he had been born in 1924 or 1925. He served as a medic in the United States Army during World War II, enlisting as a private on June 27, 1941, and returning from Europe in 1945 as a second lieutenant.
He got his start as a comedian in the 1940s as a carhop at the Atlanta drive-in The Varsity, where he increased the tips he earned by making customers laugh. He was discovered after he began performing in nightclubs in the 1950s. He subsequently made many "party albums", which were essentially compilations of his stand-up routines.
Early career
In 1952, Russell joined with film comedian Mantan Moreland for a stage act, replacing Ben Carter as Moreland's dapper straight man. One of their bits was an old routine that Moreland and Carter had performed in vaudeville and in Charlie Chan films. In the "interruption routine" (or "incomplete sentences") Moreland would engage Russell in conversation, only to be interrupted by Russell, who in turn was interrupted by Moreland:
Moreland: Guess who I saw? I saw old—
Russell: Is he back again? I thought he was—
Moreland: He was, but he got out.
Russell: Is that so?
Moreland: Yeah, he was over—
Russell: Is that so?
Soon the entire conversation was conducted in incomplete sentences, with each man anticipating or contradicting the other. Their act can be seen in two all-black-cast compilation films, Rhythm and Blues Review and Rock and Roll Revue; another variation of the "interruption routine", performed by Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover, was featured in Spike Lee's 2000 film Bamboozled.
A September 1957 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show led to several guest spots with Jack Paar on The Tonight Show and in 1961 a supporting role as a New York policeman, "Andy" Anderson, in the sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? Russell returned to the role in the feature-film version of Car 54, Where Are You? (filmed in 1990, released in 1994), with "Anderson" now serving as the precinct captain.
In 1965, Russell became a co-host of ABC's Les Crane Show. In 1970, he was a co-star on the ABC sitcom Barefoot in the Park. From 1973 through 1976, he appeared regularly on The Dean Martin Show and The Dean Martin Comedy World. Scattered appearances on television series followed, as well as occasional guest-host stints on The Tonight Show during the Johnny Carson era. Russell also appeared frequently in Las Vegas, including a series of appearances with Sergio Franchi at the Frontier Hotel in 1978 and 1979, and with Franchi in 1979 at the Sands Hotel Copa Room. He performed at Kutsher's Country Club in Monticello, New York, on January 1, 1977.
Game shows
Russell became the first black performer to become a regular panelist on a daily network game show when he joined ABC's Missing Links in 1964. Another ABC show, Rhyme and Reason, had poetry as a premise:
Host: Conny Van Dyke looks like a girl I once dated...
Russell: And now, all my dreams are strictly X-rated!
Host: Jack said to Jill when they came down the hill...
Russell: We didn't go there for water—I hope you take the pill!
Host: Will sex still be great when I'm ninety-eight...
Russell: It might be, but I won't participate!
In 1971, he started as a featured panelist on To Tell the Truth, which led to his being hired for The Match Game when Goodson-Todman Productions revived it two years later. He also served as panelist in 1968 on the syndicated version of What's My Line? Producer Bob Stewart featured him regularly as a panelist on Pyramid throughout its 1970s and 1980s runs. Russell would host two game show pilots: one was Star Words for Mark Goodson in 1983 and a revival of Jackpot for Bob Stewart in 1984. These pilots were shot for CBS, but neither pilot was picked up by the network. Russell went on to host two revivals of Jack Barry and Dan Enright's Juvenile Jury for BET from 1983 to 1984, then again for syndication from 1989 to 1991. In 1985, he hosted the short-lived NBC game show Your Number's Up, which was produced by Sande Stewart.
During his appearances on game shows, at some point in the broadcast the host would give the floor to Russell, who would recite a self-penned poem from memory, looking straight into the camera. These poems from game show appearances are typical of his style and wit:
What is the secret of eternal youth?
The answer is easily told;
All you gotta do if you wanna look young
Is hangs out with people who are old.
George Washington threw a silver dollar
Across the Potomac one day,
And ever since then, politicians in Washington
Have been throwing our money away!
The opposite of pro is con.
That fact is clearly seen.
If progress means moving forward,
Then what does Congress mean?
If you ever go out with a schoolteacher,
You're in for a sensational night;
She'll make you do it over and over again
Until you do it right.
The young people are very different today;
And there's one sure way to know;
Kids used to ask where they came from;
Now they'll tell you where you can go!
If a baby slept in a water bed,
It would be pretty grim;
You wouldn't know if he was wetting the bed,
Or the bed was wetting him.
We are all brothers under the skin,
Of this there is no doubt.
"Well, go back under your skin," she said,
"And send your brother out."
Spanking a child to get him to learn
Is something I cannot defend.
How can you knock any sense in his head
When you're whacking him on the wrong end?
He was a trained dancer, influenced in his youth by Jack Wiggins. Russell put these talents to use in the 1978 musical The Wiz as the Tin Man.
Later career and death
During the 1990s, Russell gained popularity with a new generation of television viewers as a regular on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Russell often appeared during comedy sketches between scheduled guests and delivered his trademark rhymes.
Russell's final TV appearance was as a panelist on a game show–themed week on the final season of the Tom Bergeron version of Hollywood Squares in 2003.
Russell died in 2005 at age 87 in New York City, after a bout with cancer. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean.

Killallon civil parish is situated in the barony of Fore, County Meath. It has an area of 7,626 acres.
Etymology
The parish was originally named after the early Irish church founded there in the 6th century by Saint Dallán Forgaill. The Preface to the Amhra Coluim Cille states Dallán composed the poem in County Meath. The original name of the church was Cill Dalláin, meaning 'The Church of Dallán'.
The Irish name was later corrupted into different spellings such as Killalon, Killaloone, etc.
John O'Donovan (scholar) in his Ordnance Survey Letters for Meath
stated- The parish of Killallon is called by the Irish 'Cill Dhaluain' i.e. Ecclesia Daluani or Cella Sancti Dallani. The patron saint of the parish had been changed by 1836 to Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, probably by the later Norman landowners, but O'Donovan said this change of name was not unusual. Paul Walsh in 'The Placenames of Westmeath' disputes O'Donovan's interpretation and claims the parish is named after the leading branch of Clann Cholmáin Bicc known as the Coille Follamain or Caille Follamain, after the King of Meath Fallomon mac Con Congalt who died in 766 AD. However Hogan's Onomasticon Goedelicum and the Martyrology of Donegal (under 14 September) both state that Caille Follamain is in the parish of Russagh, County Westmeath which is 20 miles away from Killallon. The 1938 Dúchas Folklore collection gives a history of the churches and folklore in the parish.
The present church is situated in Boherard townland.
Townlands
The townlands of Killallon civil parish are-
Boherard; Cloneveran; Clongowny; Dunnagorran; Galboystown; Geehanstown; Gibbonstown; Glebe; Harstown; Herbertstown;
Keenaghan; Killacroy; Kingsmountain; Lakefield; Loughanbrean; Loughanderg; Monennigan; Newtown; Pigotstown; Rathbrack; Seraghstown;

Koda James Glover (born April 13, 1993) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals. He is of Cherokee descent.
Early life and career
Glover was born in Monroe, Oklahoma, and graduated from Heavener High School in Heavener, Oklahoma. He was a four-time all-conference pick and two-time conference player of the year, posting a 28–4 win–loss record with over 300 strikeouts. During his senior year, he had an 11–0 record with a 1.69 earned run average (ERA) and 114 strikeouts. He also was an all-conference and all-county basketball player in high school.
Glover played college baseball at Eastern Oklahoma State College and Oklahoma State University and underwent Tommy John surgery.
Professional career
Minor leagues
A career relief pitcher, Glover was selected by the Washington Nationals in the eighth round of the 2015 Major League Baseball Draft specifically to pitch in relief. He made his professional debut that year with the Auburn Doubledays and was promoted to the Hagerstown Suns after three games.
Glover started 2016 with the Potomac Nationals and was promoted to the Harrisburg Senators after not giving up a run in seven games. As the 2016 season progressed, Glover was promoted to play with the Syracuse Chiefs. Prior to his major-league debut, Glover averaged 10.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched over the course of his minor-league career, and during 2016 he pitched innings in the minors before being called up to play with the Washington Nationals, amassing a won-loss record of 3–0 with six saves, a 2.18 ERA, 52 strikeouts, and 14 walks.
Major leagues
Glover made his major-league debut with the Nationals on July 20, 2016, as one of the fastest-rising draft picks in Nationals history and the first member of the Nationals' 2013, 2014, 2015, or 2016 draft classes to reach the majors. Entering the game to pitch the bottom of the ninth inning, he retired all three batters he faced on just four pitches to complete an 8–1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. All four pitches were strikes, and at least two of them were 98-mph (158-km/hr) fastballs. Glover suffered a torn hip labrum midway through his time with the major league team, which he attempted to pitch through until disclosing the injury to pitching coach Mike Maddux after giving up a home run on September 26, 2016, at which point he was shut down for the season.
Glover wore #32 in his first season in the major leagues. However, after the Nationals signed Matt Wieters to play catcher for the 2017 season, he voluntarily switched his number to #30 to allow Wieters to continue wearing the #32 he had worn with the Baltimore Orioles. In the early days of the 2017 season, Glover's left hip trouble recurred, and he was placed on the 10-day disabled list with what the Nationals described as a left hip impingement on April 26. The stint was short-lived, as he was activated on May 12. Manager Dusty Baker said he would share closing duties with Shawn Kelley after Opening Day closer Blake Treinen was removed from the role, although Kelley was reportedly to take on primary closing duties, with Glover filling in when he was unavailable.
The Nationals' bullpen struggled over the first quarter of the 2017 season, marked by Treinen's travails in and eventual demotion from the role of closer in April and Kelley subsequently disappointing in the job as his home run and walk rates spiked. By late May, the role fell to Glover, with Baker describing him as the team's "most durable" option despite his earlier time on the disabled list and hip injury the previous season. "We're willing to give it to him as long as he keeps doing the job," said Baker. Glover's improved slider drew national media attention after he struck out Hunter Renfroe to finish off the San Diego Padres with a 96-mph pitch breaking sharply down and away from the batter, the hardest such pitch thrown for a swinging strike all season. He notched four saves in five days toward the end of May while forming a back-end tandem with veteran setup man Matt Albers.
Glover was placed on the disabled list on June 11 for the second time in the 2017 season with back stiffness after a blown save. While Glover initially said he had injured his back while showering, he later amended his story, admitting he had been trying to pitch through right shoulder pain since late May and that an MRI showed severe inflammation of his rotator cuff, pain from which he blamed for "overcompensation" that he said led to a vertebra moving out of place when he slipped in the shower. Glover was shut down from his rehabilitation in West Palm Beach in September after experiencing a setback.
After starting the 2018 season on the disabled list after experiencing discomfort and being shut down with another bout of shoulder inflammation early in spring training, Glover rehabbed with the GCL Nationals and Syracuse Chiefs before being activated and optioned to Syracuse on July 22, 2018. Glover missed the entire 2019 season due to forearm and elbow pain.
Glover announced his retirement from baseball on December 2, 2019.
Pitching style
Glover employed a four-pitch arsenal, with his fastball velocity topping out in the high 90s, a hard slider (which he sometimes described as a cutter) that often reached the mid-90s, and a changeup and curveball he threw less frequently. Retired baseball scout Bernie Pleskoff, writing of Glover in 2017, described him as having "a mound demeanor that exudes confidence and no-nonsense".
Personal
In January 2020, Glover was named head coach of the Howe High School baseball team.

I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings is a live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 12 November 2001 in the UK by Parlophone and a day later in the US by Capitol Records. Recorded during Radiohead's 2001 tour, it comprises songs from their fourth and fifth albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). I Might Be Wrong received mainly positive reviews; critics praised the performances and rearrangements, but found the album too short.
Content
I Might Be Wrong comprises live performances songs from Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) recorded on tour in 2001.
As many of the songs on the albums were recorded through studio experimentation, Radiohead rearranged them to perform them live. For example, the electronic track "Like Spinning Plates" appears rearranged as a piano ballad. The guitarist Ed O'Brien said: "You couldn't do Kid A live and be true to the record. You would have to do it like an art installation ... When we played live, we put the human element back into it." The drummer, Philip Selway, said Radiohead "found some new life" in the songs when they came to perform them.
I Might Be Wrong also includes a solo performance of "True Love Waits" by Yorke on acoustic guitar. Radiohead worked on the song for over two decades; it was not released on a studio album until A Moon Shaped Pool in 2016.
Reception
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, I Might Be Wrong has an average score of 76 based on 16 reviews, indicating "generally favourable reviews".
The Entertainment.ie critic Andrew Lynch wrote: "Unlike most live albums, this one captures some of the excitement of actually being there and gives Radiohead back the human dimension they've recently been in danger of losing." Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote that the album "cast new light" on Kid A and Amnesiac. The Rolling Stone critic Jonah Weiner described it as "explosively raw", praising the "twisty, insular" performance of "Idioteque" and Yorke's "beautifully chilling" vocals on "Like Spinning Plates". Matt LeMay of Pitchfork also praised "Like Spinning Plates", saying it showcased Radiohead's "songwriting virtuosity rather than their sonic adventurousness", and "True Love Waits", which he said was "absolutely gorgeous ... It can hold its own against any song on OK Computer."
Several critics felt the album was too short. Thompson found it was "marred by characteristically unrevealing packaging and inexplicable brevity". Sam Samuelson of AllMusic suggested it could instead have been packaged with Amnesiac as a "complete Kid A sessions package, rather than a couple of thrown-together releases". LeMay criticised the lack of older Radiohead songs, and said the album had the feeling of a "promotional item" for Kid A and Amnesiac.

When I Was Born for the 7th Time is the third studio album by the British indie rock band Cornershop, released on 8 September 1997 by Wiiija. The album received high acclaim from music critics and features the international hit single "Brimful of Asha".
Recording and release
When I Was Born for the 7th Time was recorded over a period of approximately two months. Singer and guitarist Tjinder Singh described the recording process as "very intense. There was a lot of smoking going on, it was a very relaxed time, and very enjoyable all the way through. At the end, our engineer had to go for medical assistance. He got freaked out. He smoked so much and then he stopped and he went loopy. He was on medication. His body couldn't take it." The album was released on 8 September 1997 by the independent record label Wiiija. The song "Brimful of Asha" was released as a single and became an international hit. The track "Candyman" was used in a Nike commercial featuring LeBron James, while "Good Shit" was featured in a commercial for Target with the chorus being altered to read "Good Stuff ..."; in the single release and in the video played on MTV Europe the title was "Good Ships". As of February 2002, the album has sold 198,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan.
Critical reception
When I Was Born for the 7th Time received high acclaim from music critics. Writing for Rolling Stone, Neva Chonin opined that the album "is a cohesive, finely crafted LP in which the last album's low-fi funk expands into low, fat grooves, and Singh's pancultural, anti-racist lyrics become more sophisticated but no less impassioned." Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called it "an international pop so seamless that its fusion of alt-rock, Punjabi melody, hip hop, and what-all is subsumed into its own song-based catchiness". In 1998, the album was ranked at number three in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1997. Similarly, Spin journalists placed the album at number one in their list of Top 20 Albums of the Year. In 2000, Q magazine placed the album at number 68 in its list of 100 Greatest British Albums. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Jacaranda is a genus of 49 species of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.
A cosmopolitan plant, Jacaranda mimosifolia is quite common in Paraguay, Uruguay, Southern California, Florida, Mexico, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain (particularly in Málaga) and Zambia and has been introduced to most tropical and subtropical regions to the extent that it has entered popular culture. It has been planted widely in Asia, with trees visible in many parts of Nepal, Pakistan, and India.
The generic name is also used as the common name.
Etymology
The name is of South American (more specifically Tupi-Guarani) origin, meaning fragrant. The word jacaranda was described in A supplement to Mr. Chambers's Cyclopædia, 1st ed., (1753) as "a name given by some authors to the tree the wood of which is the log-wood, used in dyeing and medicine" and as being of Tupi-Guarani origin, by way of Portuguese. Although not consistent with the Guarani source, one common pronunciation of the name in English is given by .
Description
The species are shrubs to large trees ranging in size from tall. The leaves are bipinnate in most species, pinnate or simple in a few species. The flowers are produced in conspicuous large panicles, each flower with a five-lobed blue to purple-blue corolla; a few species have white flowers. The fruit is an oblong to oval flattened capsule containing numerous slender seeds. The genus differs from other genera in the Bignoniaceae in having a staminode that is longer than the stamens, tricolpate pollen, and a chromosome number of 18.
Taxonomy
The genus is divided into two sections, sect. Monolobos and sect. Dilobos DC., based on the number of thecae on the anthers. Sect. Monolobos has 18 species and is found primarily in western South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Sect. Dilobos, which is believed to be the primitive form, has 31 species and is found primarily in southeastern Brazil including the Paraná River valley. The anatomy of the wood in the two sections also differs. Although usually treated in sect. Monolobos, J. copaia differs somewhat from all other members of the genus and may be intermediate between the two sections (Dos Santos & Miller 1997).

Cultivation
Jacaranda can be propagated from grafting, cuttings, and seeds, though plants grown from seeds take a long time to bloom. Jacaranda grows in well-drained soil and tolerates drought and brief spells of frost and freeze.
This genus thrives in full sun and sandy soils, which explains their abundance in warmer climates. Mature plants can survive in colder climates down to ; however, they may not bloom as profusely. Younger plants are more fragile and may not survive in colder climates when temperatures drop below freezing.
Uses
Several species are widely grown as ornamental plants throughout the subtropical regions of the world, valued for their intense flower displays. The most often seen is the blue jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia; syn. J. acutifolia hort. non Bonpl.). Other members of the genus are also commercially important; for example the Copaia (Jacaranda copaia) is important for its timber because of its exceptionally long bole.

Antonio Giordano, called Antonio da Venafro, (1459–1530) was a prime minister of Siena in the Italian renaissance, mentioned in chapter 22 of Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince.
History
Da Venafro was born in 1459 in Venafro, Molise. He moved to Siena and attended the university there graduating in jurisprudence. In 1488 Venafro was elected professor of law at the University of Siena. In November 1493 Antonio was elected Appellate Judge. As such he was arrested by the avant-garde of Charles VIII and forced to follow them in their march to Rome. He was freed a few days later only by a direct order of the King himself. A trusted adviser and private secretary of the Lord of Siena, Pandolfo Petrucci, he was named by the latter counselor and prime minister. In the month of October 1502 Venafro represented Pandolfo Petrucci at the Diet of La Magione; and later he went to Imola with Paolo Orsini, where a peace agreement was signed between Cesare Borgia and the conspirators of La Magione represented by Paolo Orsini.
Venafro was a statesman of high calibre, appreciated and respected by men such as Guicciardini, Vettori and Niccolò Machiavelli. In chapter 22 of The Prince, where private counselors are discussed, Machiavelli describes Venafro as an excellent minister.
In 1515, under constant pressure by Pope Leo X, Antonio left Siena and returned to his native town of Venafro. But a few years later, in 1519, Antonio moved to Naples there he became a member of the Consiglio Collaterale and professor of jurisprudence at the University of Naples. He died there in 1530.

"The Wishing-Table, the Gold-Ass, and the Cudgel in the Sack" is a fairytale by the Brothers Grimm. The original German name is Tischlein deck dich, Goldesel und Knüppel aus dem Sack.
The tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 563, "The Table, the Ass, and the Stick", as well as 212, "The Lying Goat".
Plot
A tailor had three sons who were all fed by the milk of their goat. The oldest son was given the task to let the animal graze at the finest grass fields. At the end of the day the son asked the goat whether it had eaten enough and the animal confirmed this. However, when they returned home the goat claimed the opposite, causing the tailor to get upset and drive his son out of the house. This pattern repeats itself with the second oldest and youngest son too, who are also falsely blamed by the goat for not feeding it enough and as a result are kicked out of the house as well. Only when the father goes out to feed the goat himself and discovers that the creature still claims it hasn't eaten enough does he realize he misjudged his sons. He takes his razor, shaves the goat bare and uses his whip to drive it out of his house. The tailor is left alone in his house longing for his sons' return.
The story then follows each son individually. The first one went to a maker of furniture and learned the craft. After his service his master gave him a magic table as a sign of gratitude. Whenever he says "Table, Deck Yourself" the table decks itself with the finest food and wine. The son decides to travel home and show his father what he learned and earned. On his way he visits a local inn, where he demonstrates the powers of the magic table. At night the innkeeper steals the table and switches it for a normal table, without the son being aware. When the son arrives home and tries to show the powers of the table to his father nothing happens, which upsets his father once again.
The second son goes to work for a miller. His master gives him a magical ass who is able to produce gold out of its mouth and behind at the command of "Bricklebrit!" Just like the oldest son, the second son decides to travel home and happens to visit the same inn his brother did. He too demonstrates the powers of the ass to the innkeeper who once again steals the animal at night and replaces it with a normal ass, without the son being aware of what happened. When the son arrives home and tries to show the powers of the ass instead of gold pieces landing on the cloth, it is droppings like an ordinary donkey, which upsets his father once again.
The third son went to work for a woodturner and is given a magic cudgel in a bag. Whenever someone is injust, the owner of the cudgel just needs to say: "Cudgel, out the sack!" and the object will start clobbering the wrongdoer. Only when the owner says: "Cudgel in the sack!" will the thing return in the bag. Just like his brothers, the son visits the same inn, because he learned from their letters on what had happened. Instead of demonstrating the powers of his possession he deliberately remains vague about it, making the innkeeper curious enough to go out at night and try to look what's in the bag. Anticipating this, the son orders the cudgel to beat the innkeeper up until he returns everything he has stolen. When the son returns home with the table, donkey and cudgel he tells his father what had happened and demonstrates the powers of the objects. His father finally makes peace with his sons and they all live a rich life ever after.
As an epilogue, the story also informs the reader what happened to the goat. The shaven animal went to hide inside a foxhole. When the fox returned home it was scared away by the goat's eyes. The fox asks a bear for help, but he is also too frightened to go in. Finally they take a bee along with them, who stings the goat, causing the animal to run away in pain. The storyteller concludes that nobody knows where she is now.
Analysis
Origins
Stith Thompson indicated that the oldest attestation of the tale was a collection of Chinese Buddhistic legends of the 6th century.
Distribution
Scholar Stith Thompson noted that the tale type "has a very extensive distribution", being "present in almost every collection of stories in Europe and Asia". Professor Theo Meder's study corroborates this vast distribution, since, according to him, the tale type can also be found "in India and in East Asia, in Africa and in the Middle East", as well as in the Americas.
Professor Dov Noy cited that variants in the Americas are found in the French, English and Spanish traditions of the continent.
An assessment on a global scale of international tale indexes, by Daniel J. Crowley, let him conclude that the tale type appears "among the most popular and widespread tales on Earth".
The second plot involved, "The Lying Goat", is common throughout Europe, with dozens of variants recorded. Sometimes, it ends with the goat killing the owner. The final part, of attempts to banish the animal, is itself told as a separate tale (ATU 43) in both Europe and Africa, involving a variety of animals<ref>Костюхин Е. А. Когда звери говорили: Триста семьдесят пять мифов, сказок, басен, анекдотов, легенд и преданий о животных — М: Восточная литература, 2004 — С. 499—500</ref> (a Russian variant, with a fox and a hare, was adapted into a cartoon (Лиса и заяц, 1973) by Yuri Norstein).
Variants
In several variants across the globe, the money-producing donkey generated precious gems instead of gold coins. Likewise, the wealth-producing animal may differ, being, for instance, a rooster, a duck, a horse or a sheep. The food-giving object may also differ: it can be a tablecloth, a towel or a handkerchief.
Czech author Václav Tille (writing under pseudonym Václav Říha) published a similar tale, titled Ubrousku, prostři se: the protagonist receives a lamb that produces money, a handkerchief that materializes food and a magical cane.
Italo Calvino's Italian Folktales contains a variant called The North Wind's Gift (Il regalo del vento tramontano), where a starving farmer named Geppone goes to the North Wind that destroys his crops, and receives a box producing food. It is taken from him by the local prior for a price the latter refuses to pay. When Geppone goes to beg the Wind again, he receives a golden box which only works for a starving person, and which turns out to produce thugs with clubs. With pretended reluctance, Geppone agrees to trade the box for the old one. Then he waits until the prior attempts to use it at a banquet for which a lot of important clergy members are invited, and once both the prior and his guests are thoroughly beaten up, retrieves the second one as well.
In an English tale from "North-country", Jack's Luck, or The Ass, the Table and the Stick, poor youth Jack works for an old lady and receives a donkey that produces silver and gold, and for a carpenter who gives him the self-setting table. On a third occasion, after a strange man helps Jack from drowning, the youth helps him build a bridge to cross the river and the man carves the magic stick out of a branch. Jack uses the stick to regain the donkey and the table. Finally, he becomes the richest man in his home village and invites all single maidens to choose his future bride. He declares the girl must appear with their dowry in their aprons. Soon, all maidens appear with "heaps of gold and silver coins", except for one girl - Jack's "one true love" - who shows up with only "two copper pennies and a crooked sixpence" that Jack gave he when he was still a poor lad. He sets her aside, to the jeers of the other candidates, and she begins to cry, her tears becoming diamonds. Jack then sics the magic stick on the other girls to expel them and marries his beloved. The tale was also published by author Flora Annie Steel in English Fairy Tales, with the title The Ass, the Table and the Stick. A very similar version, The Ass, the Table, and the Stick, was given by folklorist Joseph Jacobs in his English Fairy Tales.
In popular culture
The table (since 1999), donkey (since 1956) and cudgel (since 1963) are exhibited in the Dutch theme park De Efteling.
A Hungarian variant of the tale was adapted into an episode of the Hungarian television series Magyar népmesék ("Hungarian Folk Tales") (hu), with the title A szegény csizmadia és a szélkirály ("The Poor Cobbler and the King of Winds"). In this version, the poor man visits the King of the Winds and obtains a lamb that produces money on command, a magic tablecloth and a beating cane.

The Yearly Meeting of Aotearoa/New Zealand (Te Hāhi Tūhauwiri) is the umbrella body and Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in New Zealand.
Quakers have a long history of involvement in New Zealand. The Quaker Sydney Parkinson was on James Cook's first voyage; other Quakers visited or settled before the first regular Meeting for Worship in Nelson in 1843. New Zealand Friends formed a Yearly Meeting, independent of the London Yearly Meeting, in 1964.
Monthly Meetings under the care of the Yearly Meeting in New Zealand include Northern, Mid-North Island, Palmerston North, Whanganui, Taranaki, Kapiti, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. In 2005 there were approximately 590 Friends in New Zealand, but about 1500 people, including children, are associated with the Society.

The caciques are passerine birds in the New World blackbird family which are resident breeders in tropical South America north to Mexico. All of the group are in currently placed in the genus Cacicus, except the aberrant yellow-billed cacique (Amblycercus holosericeus), and the Mexican cacique (Cassiculus melanicterus) which constitute respective monotypic genera. Judging from mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence (Price & Lanyon 2002), the aberrant oropendolas band-tailed oropendola (Ocyalus latirostris) and casqued oropendola, Psarocolius oseryi (Ocyalus oseryi?) seem to be closer to the caciques.
The caciques are birds associated with woodland or forest. Most are colonial breeders, with several longs, hanging, bag-shaped nests in a tree, each suspended from the end of a branch. Some species choose a tree that also contains an active wasp nest (such as Polybia rejecta) as a deterrent to predators (e.g. toucans), and females compete for the best sites near the protection of the wasp nest. The eggs are incubated by the female alone.
These are slim birds with long tails and a predominantly black plumage. The relatively long pointed bill is pale greenish, yellowish or bluish, depending on species, and most caciques have blue eyes (at least when adult). The female is typically smaller than the male.
Two species have the black plumage enlivened by a red rump, five have a yellow rump and in some cases yellow on the shoulders or crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca). The two remaining species are all black with no bright colour patches. A single species, the Mexican cacique, has extensive yellow to the tail, but otherwise all caciques have largely black tails (something that separates them from the larger oropendolas).
Caciques eat large insects and fruit. Most are gregarious and typically seen in small groups. They are very vocal, producing a wide range of songs, sometimes including mimicry.
Most remain fairly common and are able to withstand some habitat modifications, but two west Amazonian species, the Ecuadorian and Selva caciques, are notably local and scarce.
The genus Cacicus was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The type species was subsequently designated as the red-rumped cacique.

Marcelle Barthe (26 September 1904 – 24 November 1964) was a Canadian radio personality and writer.
Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Barthe studied at the convent of the Congrégation Notre-Dame in Ottawa. She co-founded "La Rampe", a dramatic society in Ottawa, in 1929, and graduated from the University of Ottawa with a diploma in music and speech. Barthe performed in stage plays until at least 1938.
Barthe was Armand Lavergne's secretary from 1930 to 1935.
Barthe began her radio career in 1933 on CKCH's daily women's program Pour vous Mesdames, under the pseudonym Françoise. The role made her the first bilingual woman employed as an announcer on the channel. At the same time, she wrote, directed, and starred in a variety of children's programs for the station.
She was the CBC's first female bilingual announcer.
She was a CBC Radio commentator for the 1939 royal tour of King George VI and 1951 royal tour of Princess Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.
Prior to the Second World War, she travelled to Europe to study other national radio in countries including France, England, and Italy.
Marcelle-Barthe Park in Montreal is named after her; it's located on Wolfe Street, between Ontario Street and Robin Street. Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Quebec's rue Marcelle-Barthe is also named after her.

The Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was a part-time unit created between the two world wars to replace the Regular Royal Engineers detachment, which was withdrawn from the Bermuda Garrison in 1928.
History
The Military Garrison in Bermuda
From 1895 to 1931, the only Bermudian units within the garrison were part-time infantry and artillery soldiers, the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps and the Bermuda Militia Artillery, respectively. Each unit had been created under a separate Act of the colonial parliament, at the prompting of the Secretary of State for War, in London. A third act had also been passed authorising the creation of a militia engineering unit of sappers and miners. This would have followed in the pattern of The Submarine Mining Militia formed in Britain in 1878 and tasked with defending major ports. They received a minimum of fifty-five days training per year, and were recruited from experienced boatmen. In Bermuda, the unit was intended to operate boat from the Royal Army Service Corps docks in Hamilton and St. George's, tending to the underwater mine defences, but the unit was never raised. Instead, the Royal Engineers 27th Company (Submarine Mining) which had been permanently reassigned from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Bermuda in 1888 (part of the company had been split off to create the new 40th Company, which remained in Halifax), continued to maintain the mine defences unaided. This unit was not raised. Unit codes were assigned to all three legislated units for marking the stock disks of the Martini-Henry rifle: M./BER. A. for the Bermuda Militia Artillery; V./BER. for the Bermuda Volunteers Rifle Corps; M./BER. S.M. for the Bermuda Submarine Miners.
Submarine mine defence was only one of many activities the Royal Engineers were involved in within Bermuda, which particularly included building forts and infrastructure. In 1900 the Royal Engineers Submarine Mining Companies also assumed responsibility for operating electric searchlights defending harbours.
During the First World War, in addition to fulfilling their roles as guardians of Bermuda and its important Imperial defence assets (such as the Royal Naval Dockyard), each of these units sent two contingents to the Western Front. Numerous other Bermudians served in other regiments and corps of the British Army, as well as in the Royal Navy and the new Royal Air Force.
Large numbers of regular infantry and artillery soldiers, plus various supporting units, had been stationed in Bermuda since the early 19th Century, but the UK Government had been trying to reduce the expense of maintaining garrisons around the world, following the Crimean War, by encouraging the raising of volunteer units in the various colonies and protectorates. This had led to the creation of the two Bermudian units, and the size of the regular forces in Bermuda was steadily reduced from about 1870 onward.
From 1919 the regular infantry battalion on garrison was reduced to a wing. Excepting the years 1925 to 1929, when a full battalion was present, this remained the case 'til 1940. In May, 1928, the Royal Artillery companiess and Royal Engineers Fortress Company were withdrawn entirely.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1928/mar/08/army-estimates-1928 UK Parliament house of commons debate: ARMY ESTIMATES, 1928. 8 March 1928. vol 214 cc1261-310 1261]</ref> The existing volunteer units were able to take on the roles vacated by the regular infantry and Royal Artillery, but the creation of a new volunteer unit was necessary to fulfil that of the Royal Engineers.
Creation of the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers
The Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was created in June, 1931. Its original strength was one captain, one subaltern, three sergeants, four corporals, and twenty-four sappers. An adjutant, a sergeant-major, and two sergeants were attached from the regular Royal Engineers. Its original role was to operate the search lights at coastal artillery batteries. The only battery left in active use by that time was the Examination Battery at St. David's Head, the guns of which were manned by the BMA.
The first commanding officer of the BVE was Captain H.D. (later Sir Harry) Butterfield, and the second-in-command was Lieutenant Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC. Both were veterans of the First World War (Montgomery-Moore had served in the BVRC before taking a commission as a fighter pilot in the Royal Flying Corps). In 1932, Butterfield retired, and Montgomery-Moore succeeded him. The new 2-i-c was Lieutenant Nicholas Bayard Dill (later Sir Bayard), a son of Colonel Thomas Melville Dill (a former commander of the BMA).
In 1937, the BVE subsequently also took on responsibility for providing signals crew and equipment to all elements of the garrison.
Second World War
The BVE, and the other part-time units, were mobilised at the start of the Second World War, fulfilling its role to the Garrison throughout the war. Some members also were detached for service overseas with other units, including the Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force. These included four Sappers who were attached to a larger BVRC contingent despatched to the Lincolnshire Regiment in June, 1940.
Another was Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Richard Gorham, DFC, who had enlisted into the ranks of the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers in 1938, and was embodied for full-time service, when the various territorial units of the Bermuda Garrison (the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC), and the Bermuda Militia Infantry) were mobilised when the Second World War was declared. As a corporal, he was attached to the signalling division at the Royal Naval Dockyard, before he was commissioned on the 28 May, 1941, as a Second-Lieutenant into the Bermuda Militia Artillery on 20 December, 1940, replacing Second-Lieutenant Francis J. Gosling, who had trained as a pilot at the Bermuda Flying School and was to depart for the United Kingdom in January for transfer to the Royal Air Force. Gorham would serve only briefly with the Bermuda Militia Artillery before he followed Gosling across the Atlantic to serve as an Air Observation Post pilot, directing the fire of artillery guns, having received a Regular Army (Royal Artillery) emergency commissions on 8 July, 1942. Gorham also served after the war in the Bermuda Rifles (as the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps was retitled in 1949).
In Bermuda, Montgomery-Moore was promoted to Major in 1940, and Bayard Dill to Captain. In addition to his role with the BVE, Montgomery-Moore also headed the Bermuda Flying School, which trained 80 local volunteers as pilots for the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm. Volunteers were only accepted from those already serving in the local forces, some of whom came from the BVE.
Disbandment
The BVE, as with all of the local volunteer units, was demobilised in 1946 following the end of the war. Whereas the BVRC and the BMA maintained skeleton command structures until they began recruiting again in 1951, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was officially disbanded.

The Smokefree Coalition was established as a national organisation in New Zealand in 1995 to advocate for tobacco control interventions by government and non-government organisations (NGOs). Its founding organisations were the National Heart Foundation of New Zealand, the Cancer Society of New Zealand, Action on Smoking and Health (Ash NZ), Te Hotu Manawa Māori (a division of the National Heart Foundation) and the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand. It ceased operation on 30 June 2016.
Background
Motivations for establishing the Smokefree Coalition included perceived gaps in the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990. It was believed the Smokefree Coalition could do advocacy to help close these gaps and that, while each of the founding organisations had tobacco control as a focus, a new entity was needed that could speak nationally to represent the tobacco control interests of these and other organisations who would later join.
The Smokefree Coalition became incorporated as a charitable trust in 1997 after which it entered into a contract with the Health Funding Authority, and later the Ministry of Health.
Vision, mission and objectives
The Smokefree Coalition adopted as its vision that New Zealand would become smokefree. Its mission statement was that it "will work to improve the health of all New Zealanders by reducing tobacco use and its health consequences. It will advocate for a smokefree Aotearoa New Zealand."
This was to be achieved through:
researching and compiling information on smoking issues in New Zealand and internationally
disseminating this information to members, Government and the general public
advocating for strong tobacco control measures, especially through legislation and regulation (including enforcement), taxation and health promotion
co-ordinating the advocacy efforts of agencies involved in tobacco control with the objective of providing a unified approach to Government on such matters.
The Smokefree Coalition supported the principles of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi and the principles and strategies endorsed by the Ottawa Charter.
Governance
The Smokefree Coalition was governed by a board of trustees who provided strategic direction, ensured the financial viability of the organisation and oversaw the activities of the executive director. Board members were appointed for a three-year term. However, in November 2007 the Deed of Trust was varied to remove the restriction on the term for which a board member appointed by one of the five founding organisations may hold office.
The Chair of the Smokefree Coalition, appointed by the Board, assumed the role of employer of the executive director and presided over all meetings of the Board.
The executive director was responsible for the day-to-day finances of the Smokefree Coalition, acted as its spokesperson and worked to further its goals and objectives.
Executive Directors of the Smokefree Coalition were as follows:
Barbara Langford 1995–1999
Leigh Sturgiss 1999–2005
Mark Peck 2005–2009
Dr Prudence Stone 2009–2016.
Membership
Membership of the Smokefree Coalition was restricted to organisations with an interest in tobacco control. Individual memberships were not allowed. Member organisations were required to endorse the Smokefree Coalition's vision and commit to active participation and collective advocacy within the Coalition.
Organisations who were members of the Smokefree Coalition included:
Areas of work
The Smokefree Coalition focused on a range of issue in its work to reduce tobacco use and its health consequences. These included advocacy to achieve: reducing smoking initiation by young people; limiting allowances for duty-free tobacco; removing the descriptors of 'light' and 'mild' from tobacco branding; banning tobacco advertising and displays at point of retail sale; raising tobacco excise tax; introducing pictorial warnings on tobacco packs; introducing standardised packaging; introducing a register of tobacco retailers; and banning smoking in cars carrying minors.
Smokefree environments
In its early years the Smokefree Coalition made a submission to the Social Services Select Committee in support of the Smoke-free Environments Amendment Bill. This Bill was passed into law in 2003 and, among other things, banned smoking in New Zealand workplaces, including bars and restaurants. New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to enact legislation to prevent all workers, including those in hospitality, from the dangers of second-hand smoke.
'Light' and 'mild' descriptors
In 2007 the Smokefree Coalition complained to the Commerce Commission about comments made by British and American Tobacco about harms from second-hand smoke and about 'light' and 'mild' descriptors in tobacco branding. It argued these descriptors gave the false impression that tobacco products carrying them were less harmful.
In response the Commerce Commission warned the tobacco industry against the use of descriptors and accepted an assurance from the tobacco industry that all such descriptors would be removed.;
The Smokefree 2025 goal
In 2009 the Smokefree Coalition endorsed the Māori Affairs Select Committee's call for the New Zealand tobacco industry to give an account of the role it plays in causing both sickness and early deaths among Māori. It was this Select Committee's Inquiry Report which inspired the New Zealand Government's commitment to making New Zealand a Smokefree nation by 2025.
In 2010 the Smokefree Coalition launched Tupeka Kore Aotearoa 2020 Tobacco Free New Zealand 2020 Achieving the Vision. This included a timeline outlining the actions necessary to achieve the vision of New Zealand being smokefree by 2020.
This document advocated for regulating tobacco's supply and eliminating demand for tobacco altogether. Later the Smokefree Coalition modified the target date for a smokefree New Zealand from 2020 to 2025 to align with the Government's commitment.
However, the Smokefree Coalition was critical of the New Zealand Government for not putting in place a strategy to achieve the 2025 goal. On 26 May 2016 the Smokefree Coalition organised a protest outside Parliament in Wellington where students lay on the ground as if dead to represent the "5000 New Zealanders who die from smoking-related illnesses every year". Then Director Dr Prudence Stone said five years [after the announcement of the goal] they were still waiting for a strategy.
Smokefree Action Plan 2015–2018 and Roadmap
In 2015, concerned that New Zealand was not on target to reach the Smokefree 2025 goal, the Smokefree Coalition worked with New Zealand's National Smokefree Working Group to publish a Smokefree National Action Plan and Roadmap for the tobacco control sector.
This Action Plan 2015–2018 and Roadmap set out the key strategic be undertaken before 2018 to place New Zealand back on track to achieve Smokefree 2025 goal. Its 13 stated priorities were:
Deliver comprehensive cessation services tailored to community needs
Increase tobacco control mass media
Utilise the best cessation technologies
Develop a policy response to Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)
Implement standardised tobacco packaging
Increase the price of tobacco products through increased taxation
Restrict tobacco supply
Control tobacco product content
Ensure full implementation of the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)
Continue expansion of Smokefree environments
Ensure New Zealanders know about and support initiatives required to achieve Smokefree 2025
Raise public awareness about the tobacco industry's conduct so it mistrusts its information and strategies
Raise public awareness of tobacco addiction so people who smoke are not stigmatised.
Trans Pacific Partnership
In 2016 the Smokefree Coalition backed calls by health professionals to Trade Minister Hon Tim Groser, calling for a comprehensive and independent health impact assessment of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement before New Zealand signed it.
The Smokefree Coalition's concern was that the Agreement would allow tobacco companies to take countries into international arbitration if they enacted health-based legislation, such as plain packaging requirements, that would impact on those companies' profits or intellectual property. The Coalition believed even the threat of such action could cause New Zealand and other countries to hesitate before enacting policy and laws that would protect the health of their people.
Tobacco Control Update
The Smokefree Coalition produced an e-bulletin, the Tobacco Control Update, each fortnight. This was emailed freely to all members and subscribers and featured: national and international tobacco control news; news from national tobacco control organisations, news from the regions, key events in the tobacco control calendar, updates from Government; tobacco industry activities and future tobacco control directions.
The Smokefree Coalition published its last Tobacco Control Update (issue 296) on 22 June 2016.
A new fortnightly version of the Tobacco Control Update is now being published by Hāpai Te Hauora, which was awarded New Zealand's newly consolidated (single) smokefree advocacy contract by the Ministry of Health in 2016. The first new edition was published 16 November 2016. Permission was granted by the Smokefree Coalition and the Quit Group to also call this new publication the Tobacco Control Update.
Criticism
The Smokefree Coalition was criticised for using government funding to engage in advocacy. In 2012 Kiwiblog writer David Farrar said the New Zealand Government should not be "effectively paying people to lobby Parliament and the Government a specific way" and that NGOs using government money to campaign for what the law should be is the "thin end of corruption".
He noted that the Smokefree Coalition received $167,213 in 2011 and 2010 and $179,890 in 2009 from Government, representing 98 percent, 96 percent and 95 percent of its funding in each of those years.
In 2016 Whaleoil Blogger Cameron Slater wrote that the Smokefree Coalition and other anti-smoking lobby groups "receive an inordinate amount of publicity for their efforts, but governments should not be funding advocacy groups".
He said anti-smoking lobby groups, including the Smokefree Coalition, had been ineffective with the number of smokers in New Zealand only having dropped from 700,000 to 600,000 in the last five years at a cost of more than $300 million.
Closure
The Smokefree Coalition ceased operation on 30 June 2016 after a Government decision not to renew the contracts of all tobacco control organisations. It held its final annual general meeting and ceased being registered as a charitable trust on 30 January 2017.
In place of the Smokefree Coalition and other tobacco control organisations the Ministry of Health (New Zealand) awarded a single national anti-smoking advocacy contract to West Auckland-based Māori health agency Hāpai Te Hauora.
