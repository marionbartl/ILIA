SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE: The Treasury has misled Scottish voters over how much it would cost to establish a fully independent administration in Scotland after a Yes vote, according to a professor whose figures Westminster has used as the thrust of its report.
Professor Patrick Dunleavy from the London School of Economics said that the Treasury analysis on the cost of independence “badly misrepresents” his research.
The Whitehall report states that the Scottish Government would need as much as £2.7 billion to establish 180 public departments after a Yes vote.
But in a tweet published shortly before Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, outlined why Scottish voters would be £1,400 better off remaining in the Union, Dunleavy said: “UK Treasury press release on #Scotland costs of government badly misrepresents LSE research [sic].”
He then tweeted: “Appears to take minimum Whitehall reorganization cost of £15m and multiply by 180 agencies to get £2.7bn. Overstates maybe 12 times?”
Prof Dunleavy also told the Financial Times: “The Treasury's figures are bizarrely inaccurate. I don't see why the Scottish government couldn't do this for a very small amount of money.” He estimates that the one-off costs of independence in relation to launching new organisations would be up to £200 million.
The professor pointed out that the Treasury's estimated costing assumed that all 180 departments would be major bodies. He also said that the figure used in his analysis of how much it would cost to set up a single UK government department - £15 million - was based on the way in which the last Labour administration established new bodies up until 2010, which he branded “chaotic”. In addition, he said some of these bodies already exist in Scotland, and would merely need to be expanded. He said an independent Scotland would only need the addition of four major departments: defence, foreign affairs, a reorganised tax and revenue office and a Scottish equivalent of Department for Work and Pensions.
In the wake of Prof Dunleavy's complaint, First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that the Treasury had been “caught red-handed trying to cook the books”.
He said: “This leaves the Treasury claims about Scotland's finances without a shred of credibility.”
Finance Secretary John Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: “The Treasury were citing Prof Dunleavy's research in the material they sent out to journalists in Scotland on Friday, it's in a Treasury press release I have in front of me.
“What we can deduce from that is the UK Government has been caught fiddling the books as they have tried to undermine confidence in Scotland about the steps that we can take towards independence.”
Mr Alexander insisted that Prof Dunleavy's work “doesn't form part of the building blocks of the analysis we are publishing today”.
The Treasury has insisted that the £2.7 billion figure was not its “official calculation”, saying a £1.5 billion estimate from Robert Young, a professor at the University of Western Ontario, formed the basis of their report. The figure is taken from the upper echelon of estimates based on how much it would cost for Quebec to become independent from Canada. The lowest estimate for this separation was £600 million.
London police are calling a ten-hour spate of shootings in the capital “unrelated” despite two of the attacks happening only streets away.
A 17-year-old man was hospitalised on Tuesday, and a 25-year-old received non life threatening injuries in broad daylight shootings in leafy middle-class enclave Dulwich on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. Best known for its well endowed picture gallery, top schools, and expensive Victorian houses, the pleasant village-feel turned to violence at around 3PM on Tuesday when a youth was shot in the stomach, reports the Evening Standard.
The victim tried to take himself to hospital by riding a moped scooter, but his life-threatening injuries overcame him enroute. His condition is now described as stable. Although police are investigating, they have not yet identified a motive and no arrests have been made.
Just 10 hours later a man was shot in the shoulder on College road, Dulwich. His injuries were described as not being life-threatening. No arrests have been made.
Elsewhere in London, during the same period, a man was shot on the high street in Peckham. He was also wounded in the shoulder and his injuries are not life threatening. An arrest was made in relation to the shooting on Thursday evening.
The fourth man, who was seriously injured and remains in intensive care for life-threatening injuries, was shot in Wanstead, East London. That attack was again only 10 hours after the first and only five minutes after the second Dulwich attack.

Catch more of Jose Antonio Vargas on Wednesday (July 22) at 8/7C on MTV, MTV.com and MTV's Facebook page or Youtube channel.
On the road to the final 24 hours before the premiere of MTV's new documentary "White People" with Jose Antonio Vargas, we've covered a lot of ground in some difficult conversations about privilege, race and bias.
From talking about ways to use your privilege for good, why white people need to take part in conversations about diversity, and providing some cool tools for you to explore your own biases and privileges, we're hoping you're all as excited to watch the documentary and start some conversations of your own.
Now that we've given you an intro to what we'll be talking about in "White People," we wanted to give you a chance to get to know the host and director -- Jose Antonio Vargas, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and all around awesome guy.
Vargas, who came to America from the Philippines when he was 12, shares more of his story of being an undocumented immigrant in his film "Documented" and through his work with his non-profit Define American. Addressing issues of race and bias is something he's always been drawn to.
"I was really, really confused when I was growing up, I was like, 'how do I fit in this white and black thing?'" Vargas told MTV News. "Ever since, I've been fascinated and obsessed with this idea of whiteness and blackness."
And that fascination brings us right to "White People," where he looks closer at the different ways people think and talk about race -- particularly what it means to be white.
"So much of what you learn when you come to this country, you learn it from what you watch, what you read and what you listen to," Vargas said. "You get the idea from society that white is good and black is not good and I was fascinated by that. For me, this film has been working in my head since I arrived here."
You can watch “White People” when it airs on Wednesday, July 22 at 8/7C on MTV, MTV.com, the MTV App, MTV's Facebook page or YouTube channel. Or, if you miss that, you can still get it Thursday (July 23) on iTunes, Amazon, Hulu and MTV's Video On Demand services.
Labour has challenged David Cameron to deliver on the recommendations of a key mental health taskforce after he pledged £1bn a year in support.
Luciana Berger, shadow Cabinet minister for mental health, said the funding, due to be in place by 2020, was necessary but called on Ministers to ensure they maintain the political will to tackle problems in NHS care.
Today Cameron unveiled the extra money in response to the report by the independent NHS taskforce on mental health which said substandard care had led to “thousands of tragic and unnecessary deaths.
Labour welcomed the funding and Berger said: “If implemented in full, these changes could make a significant difference to a system which has had to contend with funding cuts and staffing shortages at a time of rising demand, leaving too many vulnerable people without the care they need.
“The real challenge will come in ensuring these recommendations are actually delivered. For too long this Tory Government's rhetoric on mental health has not matched the reality on the ground.”
The taskforce's report said mental healthcare currently suffered from “critical gaps” and outlined concern over rising demand for support.
Suicide rates have risen and peaked in 2014 at 4,882 deaths. The report's recommendations included greater integration of mental services with physical healthcare, the provision of 24-hour crisis services and preventative services for young people. It also highlighted the “challenging” settlement from George Osborne's Spending Review.
The government announcement comes after a series of Labour MPs called for Ministers to do more to tackle the crisis in mental treatment.
Jeremy Corbyn promoted Berger's position to shadow Cabinet level and last month told Parliament:
“All of us can go through depression; all of us can go through those experiences. Every single one of us in this Chamber knows people who have gone through it, and has visited people who have been in institutions and have fully recovered and gone back to work and continued their normal life.”
When I first moved to Washington, D.C. I felt like I was trapped in an endless thunderstorm. With streams of water plummeting on my bare skin, loud thunder filling my ears, bright lightning blocking my sight, I felt powerless. I came here to follow a dream–one that I had hoped to pursue for so many years before–but, once I got here, and that dream was in front of me, I felt like it was constantly just out of reach. I could see it, but I just could not touch it. I missed home. I missed my friends and my family. I missed Aidan's Pub and cheap beer. I missed my old college house with the broken floor boards. I missed so many things that I never thought I would miss. I missed those things so much that I craved them. And I let these cravings consume me. I began to revolve my new life around missing my old one.
On the surface, I seemed OK. Friends would ask me, “How do you like it!? Are you finding your own out there?” I'd assure them that moving to D.C. was the best decision I had ever made. I would tell them, “I love it here!” But, the truth is, I was lying. And I don't think I've truly admitted that until right now. I wasn't happy. I was scared. Frankly, I was fucking petrified. And I had to do it all on my own. I had to make my way out of this storm by myself, and here is the story of how I did just that (sorta)…
During the course of my life, my social anxiety has definitely made me an outsider. The constant fear of what someone thought about me during any conversation has kept me feeling distracted and insecure. I've failed to express my opinion far too many times in fear of what my peers would think. When I started grad school in the Fall of 2016, the last thing on my mind was making new friends. That is, of course, until I noticed that everyone else was doing it. All of a sudden, a bunch of cliques had formed and I wasn't a part of any of them. I convinced myself that this was OK. I could concentrate on myself. I didn't need friends. But, I was wrong. I needed friends, and I wanted them. Making friends as an adult is not easy. Making friends as an adult with extreme social anxiety, ADHD and a long list of insecurities is even more difficult. So, I skipped those networking events and happy hours because I was too scared of what they would bring.
Throughout my first semester as a grad student I kept myself busy with a new job at the British Embassy, a position with the Graduate Student Council, and of course endless assignments from my full time graduate course load. I hoped that this busy schedule would distract me from the deep and painful loneliness that I was feeling. But, it didn't. I cried. A lot. I didn't leave the house for anything other than class and work. And throughout the entire semester, I felt like I was stuck in the middle of an endless storm. I convinced myself there was no way out and I dreamed of going back in time to my old life in Rhode Island.
I remember the first time my Mom came to visit me in D.C. I was so happy to see her. When she pulled up in front of my apartment, all of the fear and the unhappiness I had been feeling just vanished. We had so much fun. I showed her the White House, we toured museums, and enjoyed all the beauty that the nation's capital has to offer. We brunched (a lot). We laughed, we drank, we enjoyed the city that I had been living in for a few months now. For the first time, I loved D.C. But, the clear skies that came along with her visit did not last. When it was time for her to leave I hugged her goodbye and walked towards my apartment building. Tears immediately filled my eyes and I couldn't help but sob. I tried not to let her see me. I turned around to see her waving goodbye and the little girl in me could not let her leave. I ran back to her car and got in the passenger seat. And I cried. I kept crying. I was sobbing. Then, I begged her to stay. So, she did. We went to Starbucks. I told her how hard it was. I felt like such a failure. For the first time, I was on my own and I couldn't handle it.
That final day of her visit certainly did come to an end. At that point, I made her believe that I was OK. I told her that I would be OK. When she went to leave this time, I didn't let her see me cry. All of a sudden, I was back in the storm and all I wanted to do was pause the world around me.
Unfortunately, the rest of the semester was mostly the same. I was sad a lot. I stayed inside a lot. I battled with the same insecurities and the same fears that I always had. Then, before I knew it, the Fall semester was over. I bought a plane ticket to Boston. I visited my best friend from college. I went home for Christmas. I went back to Boston for New Years to spend it with my family. Everything felt normal again. I was so happy. But, the storm was not over. The new year came. I had to go back to D.C. It was time to go back to the city that felt nothing like home.
With the Spring semester upon me, I promised myself that I would work on my insecurities. I promised myself that I would set my fears aside and make the best of where I was and who I was. I was sick of keeping my opinions to myself. I was tired of letting my anxiety keep me down. So, I found someone to talk to about how I was feeling. At first, I hated it. I didn't like sharing how I felt. It made me feel uncomfortable, vulnerable and weak. But, it was working. For the first time, I felt like the sky was clearing and I was in control of my own life again.
That semester, I found myself a new project and with that project, I found myself a friend. At first, we were just two colleagues planning an event together. But, working on a long term project can really bring two people together. I became so passionate about this project. I fought hard for it and I fought hard against a lot of criticism that would have broken me down only a few months earlier. That whole time, I had a friend by my side and I knew each and every day that I wasn't in this alone.
There were still days where I felt that storm. There are still days now that I feel myself getting caught in it. But, I have learned so much from my time in the storm. I've grown so much by being stuck in this constant rainfall. I've learned that is OK to feel bad. And it is OK to ask for help. Most importantly, I've learned that we do not need to face life's storm on our own. No matter where we are in life, no matter how lost or alone we feel, we will find someone to share an umbrella with. And, if neither of us have an umbrella to share just yet, then we will share the rain.
So, maybe I haven't figured it all out yet and that's OK. I'm inviting you on this journey with me to maybe one day figure it out together. For now, let's remember this: The rain won't stop falling just because I put some of the pieces of my life together. It is going to keep raining.. And, that is OK. That is more than OK. Because without rain, nothing grows and I want to keep growing, learning and exploring.

Japanese reenact the Yugoslav Civil Wars – Look, it's the Croatian military! Oh wait, never mind, it's just some Japanese guys dressed up like Croats. The above picture, together with another picture of Japanese dressed up like Serbs, have shocked Serbian/Croatian netizens, many of whom don't seem to like the idea of some Japanese guys making a game out of the recent war in which so many of their countrymen fought and died. Belgrade 2.0 has posted a story on the photos, asking the following questions:
This is somewhat on the border of actual ‘Slavic reenactments', but I decided to post it anyway.
Serbs:
Croats:
What is the actual time needed for a war to become history? A decade, couple of years, one hundred years? What is the distance (time, cultural or geographical) needed so that we can “play war” without engaging too deeply into the actual context: who attacked first, were there any war crimes, how many people got killed, what happened after the war, etc
Such questions don't seem to be an issue to the military hobbyists engaging in the reenactment of the Yugoslav War, such as this Japanese blogger, who writes about his experiences in a Bosnian battle “Survival Game”. According to the blogger, who has posted quite a few pictures from the event, there were UN, Croatian, and Serbian forces fighting in the battle, which took place at a site called “Area 51″ in Chiba Prefecture. Unlike the real Balkan War, much of the fighting revolved around each team's flag, and there was plenty of time for participants to relax and take pictures.

If you look carefully you can see that they mixed several periods. In the Serbian team you even have general Dragoljub „Draža“ Mihailović the leader of the Yugoslav White Movement, together with partizans and modern army soldiers. In the Croatian team I think I can see WWII ustasas in modern-day soldier uniforms… and of course in the Serbian team, the track-suit guy.
Women in Oakland are taking matters into their own hands by spray painting danger spots to let drivers know about bad potholes before they hit them in Oakland's Montclair neighborhood.There are a lot of potholes on Thornhill Road where the activists have spray painted an arrow so drivers will be warned.They did this at all the potholes on the road so drivers could try to avoid trouble spots. The city of Oakland says a huge number of potholes have popped up because of all the recent storms. They aren't ignoring them even though some residents say it feels that way."It's great if they're going to fix the problem. We're always looking for road improvement in this neighborhood. Sometimes we're ignored. Sometimes it takes a long time. I know there's a long backlog of work," resident Jim Matzorkis said.The city says it cannot repair the potholes while it is still raining the fix won't stick.But they are working on their pothole plan for when the weather dries up, and say hearing from the community does make a difference. Thornhill is now on their list.If you have potholes you'd like to report Oakland has set up a hotline at 510-615-5566.City officials say there are so many new potholes they need the citizens to be their eyes and ears out there to tell them where to go.
This week on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., we saw Maria Hill's name, atop an old memorandum. But soon, fans will see the former intelligence director in the flesh.

Senate Republicans made headlines this morning for invoking the so-called “Thurmond Rule,” a practice in which the Senate opposition party within six months of a presidential election often refuses to allow votes on nominations to vacancies on the Courts of Appeals. In more basic terms, opposition party senators in the run up to a presidential election filibuster all appellate (and sometimes district) court nominees. Observers of judicial selection have noted (here and here) that there is no such formal “rule.” But that hasn't stopped senators from either party from talking about the practice as a rule or often even as a doctrine. Because both parties have, over time, valued their ability to block the president's judicial nominees, keeping alive the Thurmond Rule has proved convenient for both parties at different times.
Not surprisingly then, the debate in presidential election years tends to focus on whether the Thurmond Rule has been invoked “too early,” rather than on whether or not it should be invoked at all. Critics today, for example, noted that a Democratic majority confirmed a Bush nominee in 2008 in late June and that a Democratic minority allowed a vote on a Bush nominee in late June 2004. That would be in contrast to Republicans shutting down confirmation votes this year in mid-June. (For the record, the winner for the earliest invocation of the Thurmond Rule is actually the Senate GOP, which in 1996 confirmed its last Clinton nominee on January 2nd.)
I'm not sure there's much to be gained by judging which Senate party has abused the rule more in recent years. More interesting to me are why Republicans chose today to shut down appellate confirmations and what broader implications the Thurmond Rule has for our understanding of the state of the Senate.
First, I suspect that Republicans were less interested in the date on which they invoked the rule and more interested in the consequences of invoking it. If we assume that no more Courts of Appeals nominees will be confirmed in 2012, yesterday's confirmation of Ninth Circuit nominee Andrew Hurwitz brings Obama's confirmation rate for the 112th Congress to 52 percent. By surpassing the 50 percent mark, Obama's record is in line with recent presidents' success rates (measured each Congress) over the past decade. Invoking the Thurmond Doctrine before allowing Hurwitz to be confirmed would have allowed Democrats to call out Republicans for confirming less than half of Obama's nominees; allowing more nominees to be confirmed after Hurwitz would have put Obama's win rate significantly above the win rate of recent presidents. Indeed, Senator Grassley (R-Iowa) suggested as much today, noting that “By this time, nobody can say it's not fair to this president based on the number of nominations we've put up.” The date of June 14th is less important, Grassley suggests, than its implications.
Second, it's important not to lose sight of the broader strategy that underlies reliance on the Thurmond Rule. If we compare confirmation rates over presidential election and non-presidential election years over the past sixty-some years, the difference is stark. Assuming no further appellate confirmations this year, on average 87 percent of nominations pending in non-presidential election years are confirmed; on average just 48 percent of nominations pending during a presidential election year are confirmed. That nearly forty point difference of course is time dependent. The difference in the two rates before 1980 is six percent; from 1980 to 2012, the difference is 43 percent. This isn't surprising, but it is also emblematic of a broader opposition party strategy that has been in place for decades: Don't let the other party confirm its nominees if there's a chance (any chance, really) that your party's nominee may win the keys to the White House. The prospects of controlling the White House—and with it the power to select nominees—has driven opposition parties to slow walk nominations in presidential election years for decades.
Finally, the persistence of the idea of a Thurmond rule or doctrine that compels and justifies opposition party tactics is a telling element of the modern Senate. As Steve Smith put it last night, the Thurmond Rule is “another example of senators turning obstructionism into a norm to justify dysfunctional behavior.” Senators from both parties perpetuate the chamber's byzantine practices by engaging in these quadrennial debates about whether the other party has invoked the rule too early. They should instead focus on calling out the egregious behavior of blanket filibusters of the opposition's candidates for the bench.
SALT LAKE CITY – The U.S. District Court for Utah has denied the state's emergency request for stay of the court's ruling issued earlier Friday declaring Utah's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.
The Utah attorney general's office released the following statement, in an email received by St. George News at 9:47 p.m. Friday:
The Utah Attorney General's Office and the plaintiffs in the Amendment 3 lawsuit discussed with U.S. District Court Judge Robert Shelby this afternoon a stay of his decision prohibiting Utah's definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. Judge Shelby declined to stay his decision on the court's own accord and would not entertain an oral motion to stay. As a result, the Attorney General's Office is filing a written motion to stay, which the judge has said he will resolve on an expedited basis.
In a 53-page ruling, Shelby struck down Utah's Amendment 3 as unconstitutional, stating it “denies the plaintiffs their rights of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.”
The attorney general's office said that it would seek the emergency stay on the ruling, arguing that same-sex marriage as a fundamental right has never been established in any previous case in the 10th Circuit.

Correction The original version of this story said that Sam Wolanyk had a pistol tucked into his shorts. By his own description, it was strapped to his hip in a holster.
San Diego open-carry gun crusader Sam Wolanyk has taken off time from packing heat to packing, well, not much at all apparently.
Wolanyk entered San Diego International Airport on Friday for a trip to Barbados with a companion and declined to go through the full-body scanner. As anyone who has been following the story of Oceanside's John Tyner knows, that can trigger the controversial full-body pat-down by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers.
Rather than a pat-down, Wolanyk decided to strip down -- to his shorts, actually Calvin Klein bicycle-like shorts, according to his lawyer, Jason Davis of Orange County.
“It was obvious that my underwear left nothing to the imagination,” Wolanyk has told one media source, examiner.com.
In a prepared statement Wolanyk said he'd undergone the new pat-down a week ago and didn't want to go through the process again.
"I was not willing to be molested again," he said. "I figured that this way everyone would be happy: I don't get scanned or groped, they can verify that I'm not a danger to anyone and the line would actually move more quickly because those pat-downs take time. "
A TSA supervisor and San Diego Harbor Police asked Wolynak to put his clothes back on "so he could be properly patted down," says his attorney.
He refused. Harbor Police took Wolanyk away and have charged him with refusing to complete the security process at the airport and attempting to record the events on his iPhone, according to Davis.
"Harbor police also confiscated his iPhone and the video camera used by his companion, who was also charged with unlawful recording within the airport without permission," said Davis. "He was handcuffed and paraded through two airport terminals in his underwear to the Harbor Police office."
One Harbor Police officer confirmed that the events took place but several calls and e-mails to the police and the Port of San Diego yielded no one who could talk officially about events.
It was a week ago last Saturday that Tyner recorded his episode with TSA and posted the results to YouTube, turning him into something of a folk hero for some and a pop culture icon for the catch-phrase "If you touch my junk, I'll have you arrested."
That apparently won't be happening for Wolanyk any time soon.
"Wolanyk's iPhone and his companion's camera have not been returned yet," said Davis. " We are working on getting the recordings as soon as possible for use in Wolanyk's defense." Davis says Wolynak is due to appear in court Jan. 7 on the misdemeanor charges.
"Wolanyk will be flying to the East Coast early next year and hopes that this situation will be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties by then," says Davis.
Davis has represented Wolanyk before in San Diego. Wolanyk successfully sued San Diego for false arrest after he was picked up in Mission Beach with an unloaded Glock 17 strapped to his right hip and two loaded magazines in a holster on his left.
He was awarded $35,000. His attorney was Jason Davis.
Black may not be, it turns out, the darkest shade — at least not black as we know it. British tech company Surrey Nanosystems says it's developed the world's blackest material: made of carbon nanotubes, it can absorb 99.96 percent of light that hits it. Its developers say that to the human eye, the material — called Vantablack — completely erases any features on a surface, becoming simply a void. "It's like black, like a hole, like there's nothing there. It just looks so strange," chief technical officer Ben Jensen tells The Independent. That's because the dense coating of carbon nanotubes, rolled sheets of carbon atoms like the one seen above, are used to create a lattice that absorbs virtually all light as it's refracted around the tubes.
(Surrey Nanosystems / The Independent)
Super-black carbon nanotube coatings are used in telescopes and other instruments that need to operate without any kind of noise from reflected light. Back in 2010, NASA announced that it was assessing whether its own carbon nanotubes should be used to coat the Ocean Radiometer for Carbon Assessment, which measured ocean color and had to be covered in black paint to prevent contaminating the results. The explanatory video below introduces the concepts that underlie it and Surrey Nanosystems' technology.
Besides the color, one of the most important issues is how well the material can stick to the objects it's trying to blacken, and how versatile it is. Surrey Nanosystems says this is one of the major differences between Vantablack and similar coatings: unlike many others, which have to be heated at several hundred degrees Celsius, it can be applied at low temperatures. This makes it possible to use the nanotubes on objects that might melt with a traditional process. The company is also claiming that it's set a new record for light absorption. To people looking at the coating, though, it might not be a completely new experience. NASA's super-black surfaces absorbed 99.5 percent of light, and in 2011, researchers used nanotubes to make an object virtually invisible against a black background.
A Government Senator has claimed the State could be liable for millions of euro in legal claims due to former employees of Nama passing information on the agency's assets to third parties.
Labour Senator Lorraine Higgins told the Seanad there was a legal action in the High Court for an injunction by an individual whose information was passed on to a third party by a former employee of Nama.
Ms Higgins said she had “damning information” about a former Nama employee, whom she named under privilege in the Upper House as Paul Hennigan, a senior asset-recovery manager at the agency.
She said he was named in the court application and that he tried to “silence” her about submissions she made in the Seanad.
When the Galway-based Senator named Mr Hennigan, Cathaoirleach Paddy Burke immediately intervened and called on her to refrain from naming people on the record of the House so that they could be identified.
“I apologise, Cathaoirleach,” said Ms Higgins before going on to refer to the High Court application.
She said Mr Hennigan had left Nama and immediately joined another property company in the UK, of which he was now a director.
“[Mr Hennigan} tried to silence me on a number of occasions when he rang my office and left a message on my answering machine, threatening me with legal action if I mentioned him in a submission to this House again on this very subject,” she said.
“I wonder really at this point what he fears, in light of what came out yesterday,” she said in reference to claims by Fianna Fáil Seanad leader Darragh O'Brien that he had information about impropriety in the property agency that would “rock Nama to the core”.
Nama, which has responsibility for €74 billion in loans, is the largest property management company in the world.
The Labour Senator also said that when she brought the issue up in the Seanad previously and called on the Minister for Finance to investigate, her concerns were dismissed. “It was intimated by the Minister to me that I was abusing my parliamentary privilege. I was essentially fobbed off,” she said.
“This is a massive issue for the Irish taxpayer who will ultimately be paying out and I think they've paid out enough in the last number of years as a result of austerity and corruption,” she added.
“We need to get the Minister for Finance into this House to talk and debate about this latest scandal and see where we're going to go from this point.”
The colossal Game of Thrones ice wall could become a permanent fixture in Northern Ireland .
The 300-mile ice-covered barrier that defends the realm from Wildlings, White Walkers and giants in the popular fantasy series is actually a disused cement works in County Antrim overlooking the Irish Sea.
Now local councillors want HBO, who make Game of Thrones, to leave the set behind once filming for season six ends.
East Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson said: "It is a magnificent site and it would be a massive tourist attraction. The number of buses and people who stop to try and get views of it."
He said wider development for recreation is planned once the production crews have left. "To have the set there as well would be the icing on the cake," he added.
Much of the big budget production, based on George RR Martin's series of books, is being shot in Northern Ireland.
Viewers, meanwhile, have been debating whether Jon Snow, played by Kit Harington, will be returning after being killed in the last episode of season five.
Harington has been spotted in Belfast by fans who were quick to snap pictures of him.
The city's Paint Hall studios and various locations in counties Down and Antrim have provided spectacular settings, along with locations in Morocco, Iceland and Croatia.
Magheramorne Quarry, which is owned by Lafarge Tarmac, doubles as The Wall and the Wildling village of Hardhome.
Another famous location is the beech tree-lined road known as the Dark Hedges at Stranocum, County Antrim, which was the King's Road during the series.

The show centres on the struggle for power between a number of families in the mainland of Westeros.
The Northern Irish economy has seen a boost thanks to Game of Thrones fans wanting to visit the show's locations.
Other major production sets have drawn large numbers of holidaymakers in the past. In parts of New Zealand, locations used in Lord of the Rings have been restored, including the home of Bilbo Baggins.
An online petition is demanding that DePaul University cancel an upcoming appearance by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, claiming his speech “hurts” and “kills” people.
“The problematic and xenophobic statements and ideologies promoted by Milo Yiannopoulous [sic] are outraging,” begins the Change.org petition addressed to university President Dennis Holtschneider. “He perpetuates the dangerous systems of oppression that exist in our world and, as a result, on our campus.”
Yiannopoulos, whose lectures have become well-known for driving liberal students to fits of rage, is scheduled to deliver a speech hosted by the DePaul College Republicans on May 24, according to a Facebook page for the event.

“No Hate”—the alias assumed by the petition's author—levels two main objections to Yiannopoulos' presence on campus, complaining that he “mocks social justice and safe spaces, two qualities that are vital to the Vincentian mission of DePaul University,” and displays insensitivity toward “marginalized communities” by promoting “hate speech.”
Even the name of Yiannopoulos' current speaking tour, “The Dangerous Faggot,” comes under fire in the letter, with the author describing it as “a homophobic slur” despite the fact that Yiannopoulos is, himself, proudly homosexual.
“Yiannopoulos continuously speaks out in ways that are racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, anti-feminist, and Islamaphobic,” the petition reiterates, declaring that “by inviting Yiannopoulos to speak at a campus function, the administration of DePaul University is allowing the rhetoric of hate speech and perpetuating systemic persecutions against people of color, women, Muslims, queer, trans, and gender nonconforming individuals, and other communities on campus.
“The systemic oppression of these communities is not a form of ‘intellectual thought,' nor is it just ‘someone's opinion,'” “No Hate” incorrectly asserts. “It is real, it hurts people, and it kills. Yiannopoulos profits off of the oppression of others.”

According to the petition, Holtschneider has already refused a personal request from a student to cancel the event, allegedly telling them that “I do not share the same level of concern as you for the well-being of our students if they are exposed to this spectacle.”
“By failing to cancel the event after having been made aware of the possible consequences that would result from the presence of Yiannopoulos, the administration of DePaul University has taken a stance that is contrary to the intrinsic and fundamental values of what it means to be a Vincentian,” the petition concludes indignantly. “They are allowing the perpetuation of both hate speech and systemic oppression on campus, and this is an unpardonable action for an institution which claims to stand for and with members of all communities within the human family.”
Yet while “No Hate” focused exclusively on Milo in the petition, the cancellation of his upcoming appearance is not the author's only demand. In addition, the author wants Holtschneider to “issue a more appropriate response to the chalkings on campus and related issues, which can only be realized and decided by the students, staff, and faculty directly affected by these incidents.”
[RELATED: DePaul says no more political chalking in response to pro-Trump messages]
At press time, the anti-Milo petition had received 291 signatures over the course of three days, putting it a bit more than halfway to its goal of 500.
Several signers left comments offering sparsely-reasoned justifications for their support, such as “there's no place for hate in the new age,” “DePaul needs to be a safe space for everybody,” and “xenophobia and sexism is [sic] NOT okay.”
A few commenters, however, challenged the supporters on free speech grounds, including one who signed under the alias “Fvck Your Safe Space,” and another who suggested that if “having your worldview challenged by an intelligent, witty, and well-prepared lecturer is so frightening that [you] feel the need to stop it … the world is going to crush you.”

In November, Transhumanist Party presidential candidate Zoltan Istvan told Inverse he was concerned that another country would beat the United States to a “political transhumanist-inspired revolution.” At the time, Istvan didn't throw out the name of any one country, but the obvious choice gives a bit of Cold War flair to Istvan's warning. Though the Transhumanism movement is dominated by Americans and Western Europeans, similar ethics have long been popular among Russians, for whom the body and the body politic have always been intimately connected.
The Russian Cosmists were late nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, whose philosophy, according to anthropologist Anya Bernstein, proposed a “unique combination of scientific and occult ideas.” Cosmist writings were banned during the Soviet period, but those who protected their works were devoted to the idea of “transcendence of space, time, and the body, mastery of nature, settlement of the outer space, and even the resurrection of the dead.”
They were also, it's worth noting, very, very into being Russian.
In the book The Russian Cosmists author George Young writes that many Cosmists believed their philosophy could satisfy the “Russian soul” and considered their ways of thinking to be patriotic. Cosmist theology — it has more than a tinge of the religious to it — centers around the idea of a bold, happy future controlled by Russia.
“If Cosmism is viewed by its prominent adherents as the most Russian and therefore most significant current of thought running from the nineteenth through the twenty-first century, outside Russia the movement and the figures associated with it are all but unknown,” writes Young. “The Western transhumanists, the cryonicists, the immortalists, and certain new age spiritual movements share some Cosmist idea and practices and present the closest foreign analog.”
OG Cosmist thinker Nikolai Federov.
A resurgence in the popularity of the Cosmist ideas and writings in Russia has led Bernstein to question whether the way of thinking is now “a nationalist movement, indeed, a new Russian idea.” She points to the recent firing of the editor of the journal Russian Planet for failing to use the platform to reflect Russia's preeminence as a cultured nation. The firing offense? He didn't reference the Cosmists enough.
Bernstein also raises the point of Vladimir Putin. While neither President Putin nor the Russian government has ever offered official support of the Cosmist way of thinking, some truthers have taken to analyzing the Russian leader's public statements. In a December speech the President announced, “We all want the same thing: well-being for Russia. So the relations between business and the state should be built on the philosophy of the common task, partnership, and equal dialogue. The Philosophy of the Common Task was the title of collected works of Cosmist icon Nikolai Fedorov so in the words of conspiracy theorists everywhere, you do the math. Actual endorsement notwithstanding, a philosophy that encourages cracking the code to live forever certainly seems on brand for Putin. Some cartoonists have joked that Putin supports Cosmist/transhumanist initiatives so that he can extend his life enough to keep running for President.
This means we could see a robo-President hunt a tiger in our lifetime.
Until technology provides immortality, Putin will have to stick to the gym.
While Putin has stayed mum on his Cosmist leanings, other Russians blurring the line between Cosmist and transhumanism have been more upfront with their support of a cyborg future. Russia 2045 is the project of millionaire media mogul Dmitry Itskov, whose initiative to replace biological bodies with artificial avatars may seem insane but not not-insane enough to not be profiled in the business section of The New York Times.
In a hype video that would make Michael Bay proud, Russia 2045 declares that our civilization has become like an “uncaptained ship sailing on rough seas with neither chart nor compass.” What society with our imperfect biological bodies need is the technology that will extend our lives — and could very well mean that we live forever. While the organization's website notes that a “100 percent guarantee of implementation within a specific time cannot be provided” it does encourage people to start thinking about what robotic avatars they will prefer — a robotic copy of a human body with a brain-computer interface, a robotic body that will carry your head once your first body runs out of steam, or a “completely non-biological” body and brain onto which your consciousness has been uploaded.

Russian-identifying martial-artist Steven Seagal is a supporter of the 2045 project, and personally wrote to Vladimir Putin requesting that he support what he describes as a “social movement.” Inverse has reached out to Seagal to see if his support for the project still stands.
“For me it is obvious that this initiative will strengthen Russia's position in world science, [and] underline Russia's role in the international community as the country claiming leadership in setting and solving global problems for the betterment of mankind,” writes Seagal in his letter.
Bernstein proposes that Cosmism has the possibility to strengthen Russian national identity in the same way the country got jazzed about Eurasianism in the early 2000s. But with its' blending of occult-like philosophies and reliance on technology it's still very taboo in more conservative circles, especially among the Russian Orthodox church who aren't ready to concede that transhumanism is the “religion of the 21st century.”
Part of the underlying tenets of Cosmism is that Russia will have a active role in controlling the future; of managing the cosmos — basically the most Kremlin-ready philosophy ever.
A pocket of Twitter ran amok Saturday morning with a rumor (as Twitter is wont to do) that Georgia Tech had signed an apparel deal with Under Armour. It turned out to be a misunderstanding of 680 the Fan's broadcast originating from Tech ahead of the spring game.
Prior to athletic director Mike Bobinski coming on the show, a topic of conversation was Cal's 10-year deal with Under Armour for a reported $86 million. Bobinski came on shortly after that, answered a question from show host Brandon Leak about how an athletic director evaluates the impact of apparel deals, using the Cal-Under Armour contract as a jumping-off point. I'm going to guess some listeners got the impression that Bobinski was talking about an Under Armour deal with Tech.
Nevertheless, Bobinski's comments were enlightening, as he spoke with typical frankness. He said that Tech has had a “great partnership with Russell for years” and that “they've been as good a people and as good a partner as you could possibly have.”
However, he also acknowledged the reality that what apparel company a school is aligned with makes a difference in recruiting.
“It doesn't seem like it ought to make a difference, but it does make a difference,” he said. “It's a fact of life these days.”
He further noted that Russell Athletic is not involved in sponsoring grassroots football and basketball in the way that other companies (such as Nike and Under Armour) are.
“So it's a factor for us,” he said. “But we have a contract and we're going to be good partners and we're going to live up to that contract. But when the time comes, we're going to explore our options. It's a fact of life today.”
Given that Tech is still contracted with Russell Athletic through 2018, he went about as far as he could in articulating the impact of being aligned with Russell and sending fans the message that their complaints are being heard.
Saying that “we're going to explore our options” isn't exactly “we're cutting the cord.” On the one hand, no matter who is a Tech was contracted with, you could say that exploring options is the responsible thing to do. But it's not saying “we hope to continue our relationship with Russell for a long time,” either. In fact, he really didn't have to say anything.
Sometimes, an answer is just an answer. Regardless, it was an interesting response.
New York - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's first television ad will have you looking twice .
New York – Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's first television ad will have you looking twice.
His anti-immigrant campaign publicity shows footage of dozens of migrants crossing over a borderline suggesting that what you are seeing is the US-Mexico border.
“He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for,” a voiceover is heard halfway through.
However, the footage has nothing to do with immigrants entering the United States. The images are from the borderline between northern Morocco and Melilla, a Spanish enclave in the North African country's mainland. Melilla, in addition to Ceuta, are two Spanish enclaves that are the cause of a territorial dispute between Morocco and Spain. Morocco does not recognize Spanish sovereignty over these two tiny territories.
The video was investigated by PolitiFact, which traced it back to RepubblicaTV, an Italian television network, which broadcast the images on May 3, 2014.
A YouTube video published by RepubblicaTV and “time-stamped” May 1, 2014, shows the same footage that Trump's campaign wants Americans to believe is from Mexican immigrants crossing into U.S. territory.
The original video was released by the Interior Ministry in Madrid, showing an “onslaught of hundreds of migrants on the wall that separates the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco. About 800 tried to cross the border on May 1st. Those who failed to escape the control of the Civil Guard were hanging on the barriers for six hours before being rejected,” the video description reads.
Interestingly, the same video resurfaced on a July 2015 YouTube post titled, “1,000s of immigrants try to cross the border at once,” yet no location was mentioned.
It seems that people in charge of Donald Trump's media campaign did not double-check their facts. In their quest to lure Americans to believe that more Mexicans are trying to cross into U.S. territory, all means are valid even if it means outright lying to the American people and insulting their intelligence.

Little Ryan looks at how Bristol looks now, through his eyes and what it looked like hundreds of years ago.
I was researching what St Pauls Carnival was like back in the day and I couldn't find that many photos of it. So, I thought, Ryan, wouldn't it be great to see what Bristol as a whole was like back in the day? I found lots and lots of images of Bristol from 1880s+, picked my favourites and went around the same areas, trying to mimic the original shots. This was easier said than done, as some of the buildings and areas don't even exist anymore. This is because Bristol was bombed so badly during the war
Anyway, thats enough waffling from me, I hope you enjoy! Scroll away!

This photo means a lot to me. This is where I grew up. In the park (right) when I was a child, I fell off the fireman pole and cut my eyebrow open on the corner of a pram. After seeing the old photo (left), I wonder, if the building still existed, would I have this massive scar on my eyebrow today?

However, in the background of the original, you can see Circomedia (the church), on Portland square. Where I'm standing in the modern photo, that's roughly the distance from Portland square and Circomedia. I can assure you that Philadelphia Street is now Broadmead today.

Joe Flacco isn't perfect. Study his tape from last season and you'll find a handful of rock-solid starts mixed with a rash of mysterious outings. One week he's shredding the Pittsburgh Steelers, crashing the elite-QB conversation; the next he's frazzled and desperate against a weak-sister Jacksonville Jaguars squad on national television.
The Ravens have played good defense for so long that Flacco's early-career achievements are sometimes brushed aside. He was asked this week how he'll respond if that revered defense suffers with the loss of All-Pro linebacker Terrell Suggs. In essence, if Baltimore surrenders points, can Flacco roll with the training wheels off?
"I want us to get in more of a mind-set where we have to score points," Flacco told the team's official website. "Should this be something that makes us do that? No. We shouldn't feel any more pressure because we don't have (Suggs). We still have a great defense and we still have a great team.
"But having said that, if it does put more pressure on us, if we do feel like we have more pressure on us and we need to score more, I don't think that's a bad thing."
Flacco is the first NFL signal-caller to win a postseason game in each of his first four years in the league, but even that hasn't won his critics over. Carrying that rugged defense for once might help.
TowerFall is a game that you can pick up and play with very little prior knowledge. If you've ever hopped around in a platformer before, the basics should be intuitive. As a party game, accessibility is a central goal of the design. But there are layers of depth to dig through as you improve your archery skills. TowerFall really begins to expand as your group transitions to playing competitively.
Mastery of the movement systems in particular will allow you to pull off stunts which may seem at first to break the rules of the game. This post will go in-depth on one of the highest-level TowerFall techniques for competitive players: Hyper Jumping. It's going to get pretty technical.
Hyper Jumps allow you to leap across entire arenas in one smooth motion. They're difficult to use well, but it's possible to perform hyper jumps with enough precision to land directly on enemies' skulls from across the stage. Here's how they work.
This is a regular jump, for comparison. It's a safe move. It's easy to execute, moves predictably, and you aren't left vulnerable because you can always dodge mid-flight to catch arrows.
This is a Super Jump. To perform it, start by holding the analog stick diagonally forward and down to run. Next, hit the dodge button. This will start a dodge slide, which you can immediately cancel by jumping. Keep holding forward and you'll retain your speed boost for a distance.
It's important to hold the stick diagonally forward and down at the start. Holding just forward, you'll enter a regular dodge rather than a slide. You can still jump out of a regular dodge of course, but dodge slides are faster and give you more distance.
Keep in mind that Super Jumps are a form of dodge cancelling - this means that your dodge cooldown starts from the moment you jump. All dodge cancels leave you vulnerable, unable to catch arrows for a short time, gaining you mobility in return.
With Super Jumps you reach higher-than-normal speeds by jump cancelling out of a slide, but that speed is capped. There's a way around this cap with another form of cancelling.
During any dodge, you can tap the dodge button a second time to cancel it - this is known as a tap cancel. You may have noticed that your archer moves very quickly as a dodge begins, and then slows to a near stop before it finishes. When you tap cancel a dodge, you keep the speed you had at the moment you cancelled it. The sooner after the start of a dodge you cancel, the faster you'll go! But if you accidentally try to dodge and cancel on the same frame, the game won't register the cancel at all and you'll just perform a regular old dodge instead.
Because it's very difficult to double-tap the same button in such short time windows, I recommend using a “galloping” motion across the top of your controller. On PS4 every button on top of the controller is a dodge button, so I press R1 and then L1 in very quick succession for my cancels.
Hyper Jumping is a specific application of this technique. The start will be familiar: run forward, holding diagonally forward and down (remember, slides are faster than normal dodges). Then dodge, immediately cancel the dodge by hitting another dodge button, and jump, in that order. Continue holding forward as you fly across the stage to get the most distance.
There are many creative applications for dodge cancels - hyper jumps are just the beginning! Once your group masters these techniques, it's like you're playing a whole new game. Happy cancelling!
A Dhaka court today granted six days remand for each of four people, including a citizen of Germany, arrested over the ATM scam in Dhaka in which at least Tk 20 lakh was swindled out from various booths.
Metropolitan Magistrate Md Mazharul Islam passed the order after Detective Branch (DB) Sub-Inspector Sohrab Hossain, also the investigation officer of the case, produced them before it with a 10-remand prayer for each.
“They are directly involved with the incident,” the IO said adding that they were arrested on a specific allegation so they need to be remanded to find out whereabouts of others involved with the incident.
Police arrested the four people including the German citizen Piotr Szczepan Mazurek, said Sheikh Nazmul Alam, detective branch (DB) deputy commissioner (north).

A press release of the police identified three other Bangladeshis as Maksed alias Maksud, Rezaul Karim alias Shaheen, and Refaz Ahmed alias Rony – all employees of City Bank.
The German citizen entered Bangladesh using a false name, said the press release. “The three Bangladeshis are directly involved with the ATM fraud.”
A Polish passport and a German national identity card was seized from the foreign national.
It was the first of its kind ATM scam. Fraudsters skimmed off ATM cards of the clients and withdrew the money from various booths of three banks.
Police said they had four foreigners under the scanner and they were sure that one of them was a fraudster involved directly. They were identified from the close circuit cameras in the booths.
The central bank was prompted to order EBL to reimburse all the affected clients. Also, it told all banks to install anti-skimming devices and take necessary steps to avoid such incident in the future.
Free Willy is an American/Canadian animated television series, inspired by the 1993 film of the same name.
This television series was produced by Warner Bros. Television, Regency Enterprises and the Canadian company Nelvana for Warner Bros. Studios. The show, which aired for one season (1994) on American Broadcasting Company (ABC), continues the adventures of the orca Willy and Jesse, the boy who freed him from captivity as shown in the film. In retrospect, the series also anticipates multiple plot elements of the film sequel, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, released the following summer. The overarching conflict is reminiscent of Moby-Dick: a powerful oil baron, known to the main characters only as a cyborg called "The Machine" until the final episodes, loses his arm and part of his face to Willy while committing an environmental atrocity and wants revenge upon "that rotten whale... and his boy".
Plot [ edit ]
Jesse, age 14, has been adopted by his foster parents, the Greenwoods, and they have moved from Seattle to the Pacific coast. He is given a job at the Misty Island Oceanic Reserve, a local wildlife rescue and research institute where Randolph, his Native American mentor from the movie, now works. In the first episode, Jesse discovers he has the ability to talk to animals and understand their speech; Randolph, a Haida, explains that he is a Truth Talker. This revelation allows for Willy and the other sea creatures featured in the show to have full personalities and more prominent roles in key plot events. Jesse and Randolph work with Mr. Naugle, the head biologist, and Marlene, a research assistant, who are studying Einstein, a dolphin, and Lucille, a seal, teaching them behavioral communication with normal humans.
The main villain of the series, similar in personality to Captain Ahab, is a cyborg called "The Machine" who holds Willy responsible for his loss of an arm and part of his face. It was initially implied that Willy had bitten them off, but a flashback revealed that his submarine was destroyed upon encountering Willy, hurling him into another ship's screw propeller. His appearance recalls Locutus of Borg and the Phantom of the Opera. When not using his new submarine to create environmental havoc, he dons a mask and glove (perhaps a nod to the contributions of Michael Jackson to the films) for disguise and continues to run an oil company under his former identity, Rockland Stone.
Early in the series, The Machine jettisons his ship's skipper, a rather nervous fellow by the name of Captain Frye, revealing he has created, à la Frankenstein, four green, slimy, synthetic henchmen called Amphonids from inanimate toxic waste. They mainly function as comic relief, oddly reluctant to carry out instructions to pollute and destroy the environment, preferring to slouch around and entertain themselves, and often making costly and catastrophic errors for The Machine.
Throughout the series, Jesse is constantly fighting plots and schemes hatched by The Machine to destroy Willy, such as releasing deadly parasites and creating genetically modified giant squid predatory to orca, and to despoil the ecosystem, such as wanton spilling of garbage, toxic waste and oil into the sea. Meanwhile, he attempts to influence the ostensibly reasonable industrialist Mr. Stone to adopt environmentally friendly industrial practices through his publicist, P.R. Frickey.
While the first half of the show centers mostly around Willy and Jesse's adventures at the Misty Island Oceanic Reserve, the second half takes them to the Arctic with eco-activist Ben Shore. They discover an untouched paradise island with various healthful benefits ("Paradise Found") and are greeted by Arktos, a bear who claim Jesse is the "protector" of the island, and other talking animals. Unfortunately, The Machine follows and attempts to industrialize the island, destroying its natural beauty and benefit to the ecosystem. Ben heroically demolishes the passageway to the island after Jesse and Willy escape, thwarting The Machine, but injuring and trapping himself. However, the healing effects of the island restore Ben's health and he lives happily in his environmental utopia, having given Jesse a carved eagle necklace as a keepsake to carry on his work. Upon returning to Misty Island, Jesse and Willy become entwined in a Christmastime plot ("Yuletide or Redtide") to use a biodegradable jetski (assumed to be a gift from his parents, Glen and Annie, but actually from Stone) for the release of deadly red tide to thrive in the unseasonably warm water, implied to be an effect of global warming. Unchecked, the microbes would simultaneously destroy Willy, the ecosystem and Jesse's reputation. When The Machine is defeated by teamwork and a sudden cold spell, saving everyone's good cheer, the Amphonids make themselves into a distorted Christmas tree and actually sing along with the townspeople, to their master's chagrin.
Toward the end of the series, Jesse, Willy and Annie finally realize that Rockland Stone is The Machine and proceed to turn his attempts to manipulate Jesse to their advantage. Specifically, in the second to last episode, The Machine kidnaps Marlene's old teacher, the balding chemist Dr. Elliot, and plots to combine his oil solidification formula with a massive intentional spill to suffocate Willy and his friends under a solid orange crust. When he brazenly impersonates Elliot (using a different mask) to influence Marlene into giving Stone Industries one million dollars from Institute funds, Jesse's knowledge allows himself and Willy to see through the disguise, save Dr. Elliot, prevent the fraudulent donation and stop the oil with the formula. In the series finale ("Ghost Ship"), the heroes finally unmask The Machine before the public, bringing him to justice and freeing Willy, the other sea creatures, the people of Misty Island and the environment at large from his reign of terror.

Decommissioning a free public API
2015-11-20 17:51
This is a sequel to my "Adventures in running a free public API" post which you should read for some background information about the reasons behind terminating the free public instance of Telize.
I stopped the service as planned, on November 15th, after a two weeks notice. I should probably mention beforehand that things were more complicated that they could have been due to poor initial planning on my part. When I launched the public instance, it was mean as a way to demonstrate the open source project, and to be honest I didn't really anticipate the amount of traffic it would receive. So basically, I didn't bother configuring a subdomain to host the endpoints, and hosted them on the main domain. If I had done so, I could simply have removed DNS records for the subdomain, basically sinkholing it and be done with it. As the HTML pages needed to stay accessible, my only option was thus to block the endpoints by returning an HTTP error code, and so configured Nginx to return a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code. This should have been it, right?
In an ideal world, maybe. In practice, it triggered a huge amount of retries on failed requests from poorly coded scripts, effectively creating a DDoS cannon causing CPU and I/O (both network and disk, think of logging) usage to skyrocket. Now on a busy day, Telize received more than 130M requests, coming from 10M unique IP addresses as one can see in this report generated by Logswan. We were now talking about almost 800,000 requests per minute, as shown on this other report generated from sampling one minute of traffic. At this point I had to switch to using Nginx's 444 No Response HTTP status code and just close the connection in order to save bandwidth. On the day following the API termination, I received more than 1TB of incoming requests, which represent a huge amount of traffic and of course, bandwidth costs money. I can perfectly handle this kind of traffic from a technical standpoint, but from a financial one, there is simply no way I can sustain it, and it doesn't make sense for me to keep paying for data transfer overcharges. So I had to move the site in emergency to a static hosting platform (GitHub Pages in this case) which then returned a 404 error for all three endpoints: 'ip', 'jsonip', and 'geoip'. The last one being by far the most used one, it probably triggered some alert mechanism and caused the appearance of a Varnish rule simply closing the connection on this endpoint, returning an empty response. The situation was now under control, and I was finally able to relax and get some much-needed rest; this was Sunday evening, and I decided to call it a day and get some sleep. I'm extremely grateful to GitHub for saving the day, and in fact decided to subscribe to a paid plan as a way to show my appreciation. So, problem solved?
Not so fast! The next morning (on Monday), I was in for a surprise as my mailbox started to fill up with inquiries regarding Telize termination. Basically, some code was crashing at random locations because people relying on a free service for their businesses were not careful enough to implement correct error checking. One of those mails came from a set-top box manufacturer, stating that thousands of customers were unable to watch TV because their boxes crashed when Telize didn't return any data, and demanding that I return an empty JSON object for a two weeks period. I answered as fast as I could, explaining the situation and that I had no control over this as the endpoint had a Varnish rule closing the connection without sending traffic. Realistically, should I have chosen to fulfill the request, I would have had to go back to handling the traffic myself on my own servers. This didn't end there, as the person wouldn't take no for an answer, and came up with the brilliant idea to ask me to redirect the endpoint to a server they would host themselves in order not to just serve empty data this time, but simply restoring service entirely. I had to re-read the mail a couple of times to ensure my brain was not tricking me. On what ground would I allow a third party to serve content on one of my domains? How on earth did I dare not to act on this unreasonable request on a timely manner, warranting further annoyance both by mail and on Twitter, lasting for two days?
So basically, what's the moral here? Some people just expect you to invest your own time and money to solve their problem, and for you to do it straight away, when it's convenient for them, and of course without being compensated for it. No matter that they used a free service to begin with, without giving any notice beforehand, or that you have a daytime job and other involvements. I would not have it so.
Hopefully, this whole story will at least teach some people that relying on a free service you have no control over means adding a single point of failure on a volunteer basis. It's perfectly fine for a side project, but for a business? I would think at least twice before taking this kind of decision.
Let's start off with a statistic or two. Since the inception of GP2 in 2005, only one non-Red Bull backed driver has graduated from Formula Renault 3.5 (World Series Renault) to a Formula 1 race seat. That man was the 2005 champion, Robert Kubica.
In that same period, 20 drivers have graduated from GP2 to F1, with a further four being added to the list in 2013 (Gutierrez, van der Garde, Chilton and Razia) and one from GP3 (BOTTAS.)
Red Bull has, in the same period, promoted four drivers direct from World Series: Vettel, Alguersuari, Ricciardo and Vergne. It has not placed a fully backed driver into GP2 since Sebastien Buemi finished sixth in the 2008 championship.
Since the inception of GP2, the two championships have both provided one Formula 1 world champion – Hamilton for GP2 and Vettel for WSR.
So, why the sudden fetish for stats?
As yesterday's news started to filter through that Adrian Sutil had landed the final seat in F1, alongside Paul di Resta at Force India, I actually started to feel bad for Jules Bianchi whom had also stood a chance at the seat. Jules, you see, would have been the first World Series driver to graduate to F1 without Red Bull backing since Kubica. And the fact that he won't be leaves the whole junior championship ladder in an odd state of flux.
Jules seemed to be a dream package. Young, hungry, talented and fast… and a Ferrari Academy driver, managed by Nicolas Todt. It is little wonder that talk soon surfaced that Force India was hoping to switch engine suppliers from Mercedes to Ferrari for 2014, and that any deal with Jules would require some form of a sweetener from the Scuderia on the figure proposed for an engine supply. It is simple enough business.
Nicolas Todt is as close to the Messiah of young driver managers as you could hope to find in the modern era. And Jules is his shining light. I interviewed Nicolas a few years ago about his career and I asked him what would make him proudest. His answer came straight from the heart. He wanted to see Jules in Formula 1. You see, all of Nicolas' other drivers had come to him either when they were already in Formula 1 or when they were just on the cusp of getting there. But Nicolas had discovered Jules in karting and had guided him all the way through his career.
With that in mind, you will have some idea of how hard Nicolas will have worked to get that Force India deal done.
Ultimately this whole thing will have come down to finances. The money off deal proposed by Ferrari for their 2014 engines will have been less than Adrian Sutil was able to bring to the table. Factor in also that the team knows how reliable Sutil can be in a racing car while Bianchi remains the untried and often hot headed youngster, and one can see how the decision was reached.
But if Jules Bianchi, with the might of Ferrari and arguably the best driver manager in the business, can't get a leg up from WSR to F1, what chance does anyone else in the category have?
The logical next step after WSR, if F1 isn't happening, must therefore be GP2. But for Bianchi and his one-time team-mate Sam Bird, they've gone in the opposite direction. After a few years spent winning races in the F1 feeder, they moved sideways to World Series and arguably had their best, most complete seasons as racing drivers ever. But now they find themselves in limbo.
Alexander Rossi on the other hand, along with 2012 WSR champion Robin Frijns looks set to do the opposite and join the GP2 fold for 2013. Rossi's story is an interesting one. He was partnered with Esteban Gutierrez at ART in GP3 in 2010. But while the Mexican moved to GP2 in 2011, the American moved to WSR. After two years a piece in their respective championships, Esteban Gutierrez is a Formula 1 driver, and Alexander Rossi is looking at making his GP2 debut.
So what was the point in those two seasons in World Series? Was it a huge waste of money and time? If only those backed by Red Bull have any chance of making it out of World Series and straight into F1, what do young drivers do? Racing in a championship that holds no hopes of providing that stepping stone to F1, if that is a driver's ambition, is surely a waste of time. But simply stepping up to GP2 is not that simple. And again, the reason is money.
When GP2 was created for the 2005 season, the top line budget was around €750,000. The championship contested 11 rounds, 10 in Europe with a season finale at the Bahrain International Circuit at which Nico Rosberg recorded the first ever back to back weekend set of wins to beat Heikki Kovalainen to the crown.
In 2013, at the end of the third three year cycle of the championship, GP2 will once again contest 11 rounds. But budgets this year have hit such levels that even 2007 champions iSport International have had to miss the first test of the season and are hoping to sell their team. As referenced by Autosport.com in an article on iSport's sad demise, the budget the team was looking for, per driver, was €1.8 million.
Paul Jackson has never sold his seats at a premium. He has always sold his seats at the same price to both drivers, so that both would be assured equal status within the team. If that's the price he was quoting, you can be assured that was about as low as it could go. So GP2 budgets, in 2013, are one million Euros higher than they were when the championship was launched.
Of course, the F1 calendar itself is partially to blame for this. There aren't 10 European races anymore to make a 2005 style GP2 calendar possible. With the folly that was GP2 Asia now consigned to history, the venues which that championship called home have been absorbed into the main championship. So we have Malaysia, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and now Singapore on the list.
On the one hand this makes the championship very attractive as it prepares drivers for F1 on F1 race tracks and in front of F1 teams. On the other hand, it means that unless you can get around €2million of personal backing a year, you aren't going to be competing.
2012 saw arguably the weakest field in GP2 history. 2013 has some outstanding talent in the field, but questions are already being asked of whether the line-up across the board is of the level we have come to expect from what remains, to my mind, one of the most exciting single-seater championships in the world, and a championship which has always sold itself on being THE Formula 1 feeder series.
Perhaps, then, we shouldn't be so surprised that GP2 should be so successful in seeing its drivers promoted to F1. Afterall, in an era when talent alone is not enough to grant a driver his break at the bigtime in F1, money really does talk. If you can't afford to race in GP2, then how are you going to scrape together the backing to buy yourself a run at the F1 rookie test, let alone put together a package that is enticing enough for an F1 team to stick your sponsor's logos on the side of their car and allow you to go racing?
Think of the last driver that you can recall making it to F1 on talent alone? Who genuinely made it without a cent to his name in personal backing? Wracking my brains, and really wracking them, I'd probably say Timo Glock. I mean even Timo had some funding, but nowhere near enough to be able to get himself a gig in F1.
How sad that in the year when Timo's F1 dream comes to an end, the team with whom he took the GP2 title in 2007 should also be seeing their GP2 dream come to a premature conclusion.
The problem stems, in my mind, from the top. F1 budgets remain stupidly high. And for as long as the concept of a budget cap is pushed to the side they will remain prohibitively ludicrous. For as long as this is so, all but the very top few teams will have a budget shortfall from sponsorship and will need to find the fastest driver available with the biggest raft of personal backing to make up the numbers.
This, then, filters down to F1's direct feeder categories.
The whole question of Europe's junior formulas is one which needs seriously addressing. Whether you prescribe to the Formula Renault 2.0, World Series route, or the GP3, GP2 route, the struggles of the once fertile Formula 3 championships and the death of Formula BMW should have us all worried. Formula E is coming along, so too Formula 4… but where is the budget for yet more new championships when the ones that exist are struggling to stay alive?
World Series and GP2 are both very fine championships. It is arguable at the moment as not all seats have been filled, but for the first time in many a year, WSR is looking as though it may just have the edge on GP2 in terms of the overall level of the field this season. Red Bull has another hotshot on its hands in Antonio Felix da Costa, who was so devastatingly impressive in GP3 and WSR last season. I have said before that if he isn't racing in F1 by mid-season, I'll be shocked. But what chance do his WSR rivals have? And in GP2, who can mix results with budget and make themselves a viable proposition for F1 2014?
The fact remains, there is a logjam. There are so many talented drivers who do not have anywhere to race where they can make a living. With Formula 1 closed to all but those with the richest benefactors, and a season of GP2 costing almost as much as a half decent ride in Indycar (seriously), World Series is, of course, a cost effective championship consideration for almost every driver at this level. It's still not cheap, but comes in at about the same levels a GP2 season was costing back when it was launched in 2005. But, as we have already discussed, if you can't afford GP2 then you can't afford F1.
GP2 is coming to the end of its third three year cycle. And with that in mind, it will soon become time for the teams to re-apply for the next generation. How many will do so is a very real question. With the demise of iSport, Ocean falling by the wayside and rumours of other race and championship winning teams struggling to find full budget, there are very serious issues facing the fourth generation of the championship. The problem has always been one of rewards. The teams have always felt spare parts are too expensive, that travel needs to be heavily subsidised, and that a fair distribution of the money accrued from television rights should be established.
Perhaps it is time for the GP2 teams to form their own version of FOTA, and to form a united front to create a new constitution. Times have changed, and the junior formulas must change with it or see themselves collapse along with those once mighty bastions of grass roots racing which now lie either in intensive care, or a shallow grave.
I have, for many years now, believed that GP2 has the capacity to become a professional championship. If the teams were allotted a fairer distribution of the money the championship makes, it would allow them a stable platform and the ability to sign drivers based on quality rather than wallet size. GP2 could become a viable racing alternative to F1, and a holding pen for the hugely talented drivers for whom there is no place at the top table.
The GP1 trademark was, a long time ago, registered and is held by one Bernard Charles Ecclestone. Could the launch of GP1 be the answer? F1 teams use, let's say, 2 year old cars with rev limited engines and put their test and reserve drivers in to give them track time and experience. Or perhaps we take a two year old F1 car, clone it and put the 20 best drivers outside F1 in the bad boy and go racing.
But wasn't that what GP2 was supposed to be in the first place? And if we're talking about budget shortfalls for GP2, the last thing we need is another tier between it and F1.
Jules Bianchi's failure to land an F1 seat, however, coupled with the utterly depressing financial woes at iSport International are just the latest pieces of evidence that we stand at a crossroads.
Now is the time, I feel, for GP2 to take its place as a professional championship, and to give a deserving home to the 20 most talented single seater drivers in the world not racing in F1, where they can make a living, make names for themselves, and carry on giving the fans the most incredible racing spectacle. It needs to be a place where the teams can make a genuine business rather than simply existing. Where they can give the best drivers the best chances, rather than pimp the best rides to the highest bidders. Let GP3 and WSR be the feeders for this championship. Let the championship bosses work together to create a structure for the greater good of the sport.
There's no reason why it couldn't work. All it requires is a slight shift in philosophy from those at the top, and a bit of a wider perspective that without change in a quickly evolving world currently living through one of the deepest financial crises in generations, every business no matter how large or small, is doomed to failure.
I've been accused in the past of being a bit too much of an idealist, an optimist… a romanticist. And I guess to a large degree I am.
I hate that the very suggestions of change seem so impractical. But they probably are.
Aren't they?
EDIT – March 1st 2013: With Marussia's termination of its contract with Luiz Razia, Jules Bianchi has been announced as the team's second F1 race driver for 2013. I'm so sad for Luiz, but delighted for Jules. Of course, that makes the stats at the start of this piece slightly different, as Jules now does indeed become the first non-RB boy since Kubica to gain promotion to F1 from WSR. The issue, as outlined in this article however, remains. Marussia's own reasoning for the late switch in drivers hinged on assuring their fiscal stability into the future. Jules brings that and, so we believe, the prospect of a Ferrari engine deal for 2014, as Cosworth will not be producing a V6 Turbo next season. To get your break in F1, you still need to bring a large slice of financial pie. Until we see a meaningful budget cap that will cut budget shortfalls, only the richest will get their break and the junior formulae will continue to struggle in F1's wake.

How do you measure success when hunting and fishing?
As I headed towards Lake Mille Lacs for the night bite last week, I start to wonder how good fishing will be. There has been a lot of bad publicity over the fish populations and it makes me question if it is worth the trip.
You never know if you don't go, right?
We get to the lake a little before dark and we are planning on trolling stick baits along the west shore like we have in the past. There are very few trucks at the access.
As we let out the first line my bother hooks a fish and pulls in a 14-inch walleye. Success! Right??? Immediately we start to think we are going to get into a great bite.
It wasn't long and I hooked into a bigger fish and pulled in a 20 1/4-inch walleye. Success again. But still nothing to keep. Is that a success yet?
Well we ended up catching eight walleyes and two northerns but only able to keep 2 walleyes and one northern. Is that success?
Everyone's interpretation of success is different. The more success you have had in the past the more you expect out of your future hunting and fishing endeavors.
I feel that we place too much importance on the catch and kill these days and not enough on just enjoying the experience.
Success can be just being able to find enough time to make a few casts, a walk through a field, a little time in a tree stand.
I think that one reason kids are not as interested in hunting and fishing is because they want immediate reward. We have to show youth that the reward is not always a big buck, a huge walleye, or a huge turkey. The reward is simply being able to spend some time in the great outdoors with our children. The rest is just extra.
A bowhunter may spend night after night in a tree and see a lot of deer and never pull the string back because he has set his standards pretty high and will only shoot a 150 class buck or bigger. The next guy shoots the first deer to walk past and is more than thrilled just to be able to put some meat in the freezer. Who has had more success?
A walleye fisherman may set standards that make him release everything over or under a certain size but the next guy will keep everything that the state regulations will allow. Who is right? Who is successful?
Is success catching a meal of fish or a limit of fish?
A muskie fisherman may cast and cast and only have one follow.
I feel that we have to learn to appreciate the moment. Every minute we find to spend in the great outdoors can be seen as a success. Our lives are getting more hectic and it is getting harder and harder to make the time to enjoy the great outdoors.
So set your goals, set your standards. But don't measure your success by what you catch or what you kill. Measure your success by just being able to spend quality time enjoying the great outdoors. If you want to feel a higher level of success then enjoy it with another person especially with our youth.
Try to take something from every hunt and every fishing experience. Every moment you get to spend in the great outdoors is really a true SUCCESS! The rest is just details!
So I leave you with a couple questions. What is success to you? Do you appreciate the time and other experiences in the great outdoors, or is it all the catch and kill? How do you portray success to your kids or other youth in the outdoors?
Greetings Citizens,
It looks like the Hornet launch couldn't end without one final stretch goal unlocked! Our backers have hit the incredible $26 million mark, which enables us to expand the capital ship mechanics in Star Citizen.
Enhanced Capital Ship Systems – In addition to the command and control systems we've already outlined, we're going to expand capital ship functions! Lead a damage control team to fight fires and repair key systems during battle, control internal bulkheads to slow boarders and man a number of consoles, like navigation and engineering, that will make commanding a capital ship feel even more immersive.
In honor of this goal, I'd like to share the very first in-engine shots of the Idris corvette's interior, showing the hangar bay and engine room. The design team is very eager to get to work on expanding capital ship interactivity; we have some new ideas about how to make crews interesting and can't wait to try them out.
For the $28 million stretch goal, we have something we're very excited about here at Cloud Imperium: a second option for your Star Citizen starter ship! Here's the goal:
New Starter Ship – The team at Consolidated Outland has decided to take Roberts Space Industries head on in 2944 by premiering the Mustang personal spacecraft. We will use these additional resources to create another ship company and starter ship for Star Citizen. The new ship will be offered for sale alongside the Aurora, so players have a choice between two options to begin the game!
Founded by maverick trillionaire Silas Koerner, Consolidated Outland is an up-and-coming spacecraft concern, the first ever headquartered on a frontier world. Koerner, who made his sizable fortune in jump-communications, founded the company as an attempt to strike back at what he sees as the overly-regulated spacecraft industry. With facilities established as far from possible from the prying eyes of competing corporations, Outland is quickly becoming one to watch.
After finding initial success with spacecraft conversion kits, Outland is now ready to run with the big boys: the new Mustang spacecraft line is preparing to go into mass production is priced to compete with Roberts Space Industries' Aurora. Using newly-developed construction techniques and ultralight material alloys sometimes considered unsafe, the Mustang pushes power ratios to the limit. The result is a sleek, stylish spacecraft that weighs less than the Aurora and has more options for engines and thrusters… at the expense of some stability, weapons hardpoints and cargo capacity.
The Mustang isn't planned as a replacement for the Aurora, it's another option that may better suit some play-styles. Want a reliable personal starship? Go with the Aurora. Want something with a little more power, at the expense of cargo? Try the Mustang!
We plan to assign a top concept artist to develop the look of the Mustang… and, as always, you'll follow the whole process! When it's ready, we'll make Mustang packages available in the pledge store; users who prefer the new ship to the base Aurora will be able to make the switch at no cost (LTI will transfer, where applicable.) New players will be able to start the game with a significant choice, increasing immersion all the more!
The additional funding that backers is providing let's us secure the resources to build ships, planets and systems that go beyond the original budget… but not the original vision. Thank you for helping make Star Citizen all that much better, with more immersion and more choices that will allow players to shape their experiences.

McGREGOR - The Marines have a saying that translates to the fast-paced work of developing rockets and forging a path toward colonizing other planets. Semper Gumby: Always flexible.
For one thing, the launch pad is an unpredictable place, with fires like one two weeks ago a concern. Then there's the technical challenge of achieving liftoff and propelling a rocketship through the heavens. And always, astronauts must be protected from radiation and other deep-space hazards.
As the commercial space industry assumes a larger role in the evolving national space race, one of its top private companies is finding military veterans an integral part of its workforce. At the SpaceX test facility in McGregor, a third of more than 550 full-timers have military backgrounds. Employees say they are used to mission-driven tasks.
"What more compelling mission is there than to make humanity an interplanetary species, right?" said Zachary Ledford, a former Army field-artillery officer who now works with SpaceX's human resources' data and automation team. "There's nothing else going on in the world right now that's more exciting and more compelling."
SpaceX, the Hawthorne, Calif.-based brainchild of a boundary-pushing billionaire, Elon Musk, and Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com fame, are among the biggest players working on powerful rockets for the next generation of space travel. Both have operations in this state, with SpaceX rooted in the Central Texas prairie.
Since 2003, Musk's company has steadily increased the size and workload at its McGregor test site, where it brings every one of its engines for testing. Technicians and engineers build and maintain 14 test stands that secure rocket engines for testing, diverting the flames into a concrete trench. They work with their counterparts in Hawthorne to turn big-picture ideas into feats of modern science.
"We're where the action is at," said Michael Adams, a Navy Reserve officer and a SpaceX build-reliability engineer. "There are a lot of test ops out here. We're firing off engines. We're firing off stages. There's a lot to be done out here."
Co-worker Joel Fecke likens the work to his critical high-tempo job in the Army overseeing maintenance of vehicles, weapons and equipment of a cavalry scout squadron.
"The way we work together as a team, it's really what speaks to the veterans," said Adams, who served aboard a nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine.
Dozens of missions
SpaceX has successfully launched 45 missions since 2008, when it made history by getting the first privately developed liquid-fuel rocket into orbit.
The rockets carry cargo into space for NASA, place satellites into orbit for commercial customers and complete national security missions for the U.S. government. First-stage boosters have successfully landed on drone ships or solid ground 19 times - another history-making feat for SpaceX - and three missions have reused one of the previously flown boosters.
"It is an optimistic time to be in the space industry," said Bill Ostrove, space market analyst for Forecast International, which provides consulting for aerospace and other industries. "There is a lot of capital and talent flowing into the industry right now. We're definitely seeing a lot of advances that haven't been made in a long time."
RELATED: After explosion, much is riding on SpaceX launch
The space industry received more than $2 billion in equity investment through the first nine months of this year, according to a report from Space Angels, a network of angel investors focused on early-stage commercial space investments. That includes personal investments from individuals in the business like Bezos, Musk, Robert Bigelow and Richard Branson.
A handful of commercial companies are launching payloads into orbit or developing rockets. Orbital ATK used a medium-lift rocket earlier this week to deliver cargo to the International Space Station as part of its contract with NASA. Blue Origin recently completed a hot-fire test of its BE-4 engine, which is capable of producing 550,000 pounds of thrust at sea level.
The BE-4 engine will be used to power Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. The first-stage booster will have seven reusable liquid-oxygen, liquefied natural gas engines generating 3.85 million pounds of thrust.
SpaceX is developing a heavy-lift and super-heavy-lift rocket of its own. The Falcon Heavy will have 27 Merlin first-stage engines, three times more than the Falcon 9 that SpaceX is currently flying, fueled by liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene. The engines combine for a total of 5.13 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.
"There's a lot of interest and a lot of excitement in this area right now," Ostrove said of overall launch vehicle development.
Musk is targeting Mars, ultimately. SpaceX is developing an even heavier-lift rocket, with new Raptor engines, that could one day reach the Red Planet. The vehicle is being called "BFR." With 31 Raptor engines on the BFR booster, it's expected to be more powerful than the Saturn V rocket that NASA used to propel astronauts to the moon.
The Raptor engines will be fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid methane, the latter being available on the surface of Mars for the return journey to Earth. Raptor engines have been tested for a total of more than 1,200 seconds of firing across more than 40 main engine tests.
SpaceX, Blue Origin and NASA are the main U.S. players developing heavy- and super-heavy-lift rockets, Ostrove said. The commercial companies, however, are taking opposite approaches to rocket development.
SpaceX has less powerful engines but is building more of them. The rationale is that more practice will accelerate learning and bring down costs, Ostrove said. Blue Origin is putting fewer, more powerful engines on its rockets. Its rationale, he added, is that fewer working pieces will make it easier to integrate the various rocket elements.
Blue Origin declined to comment for this article.
Ostrove said the big question moving forward is whether the market can sustain both companies. That will largely depend on their pricing to carry payloads to the moon, Mars or beyond.
"I think it's still very far out there, but we're a lot closer to have, sort of, an economy around these heavy-lift launch vehicles," he said. "We're probably closer to that now than we've ever been."
Quiet prominence
McGregor, near Waco, has quietly fulfilled an essential role for SpaceX over the past 14 years, becoming the company's second-largest location in terms of employees. Testing all those engines in preparation for their less-than-three-minute journey into orbit keeps employees at attention.
"We had a phrase in the Marine Corps that we used to use called Semper Gumby, which means 'always flexible,' " said Steve Fuchs, who used reverse-osmosis equipment to create clean drinking water for troops. "That's very much the same here at SpaceX. ... You may come to work thinking you're going to do a certain job, and that may change three times by the end of the day."
Fuchs, currently director of fabrication and support in McGregor, started working for SpaceX in 2005. He was living on the Kwajalein Island, in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Australia, when the young company arrived with plans to launch rockets. Fuchs worked as a civilian contractor for the island's Army base, but he was immediately intrigued by SpaceX.
He soon got a job preparing the launch pad and helping integrate the rocket. But "everyone did everything" in those days, so Fuchs also captained the 40-foot catamaran that ferried employees to and from the smaller island where launches would occur.
He witnessed two liftoffs - neither completely successful - before moving to Texas in 2007. In the early days, most of McGregor's SpaceX employees worked out of an underground bunker, a vestige of the site's extensive history developing explosives and missiles.
The bunker had one restroom, a kitchen and offices. Fuchs recalled technicians working from two shipping containers pushed together. It was common for vehicles to get stuck in the mud and for the power to go out.
Much has changed. The original test stand, left behind by Beal Aerospace, has been augmented with one more closely resembling a launch pad. Multiple buildings spread across more than 4,000 acres house desks, work areas for technicians and rocket stages awaiting testing. That underground bunker is now a test control center.
Ups and downs
Complex systems are celebrated in the SpaceX Hall of Flame, with pictures depicting different iterations of engines undergoing testing. Employees' cubicles are adorned with mission patches of successful launches.
One notable Texas monument is the Grasshopper. Used to test guidance, navigation and control systems for landing a rocket booster vertically, the prototype's namesake comes from large, insect-like landing gear. The Grasshopper started with hops of only a matter of inches, but ultimately it flew half a mile into the air.
The celebrations of such successes also come with the recognition of setbacks. On Nov. 4, an engine caught fire during a qualification test that occurred before ignition. One test cell was damaged. No one was injured, and SpaceX doesn't expect the incident to affect its launch schedule.
The engine being tested was a Block 5 Merlin, and SpaceX rockets are currently using the Block 4 Merlin.
Testing of Block 4 Merlin and other engines has continued as planned. Such testing generally occurs twice a day, six days a week, so frequent that many employees hardly notice the noise. Yet some still go outside to watch. Fuchs can tell the type of engine and where it's being tested by simply listening to the sounds reverberating through his workspace.
Adams can watch second-stage tests from the window near his desk.
"I do take about 15 seconds," he said. "I lean back and I look at it. And I'm like, 'Yeah, that's cool. We do this for a living.' "
Adams was transitioning to the Navy Reserve and working on his master's degree in aerospace engineering when he stumbled across SpaceX. He had been interviewing with the more established space organizations and planned to be a company man.
"That's what space was. Space was the pencil ties and the pocket protectors," he said.
But as government funding dried up, the established aerospace players weren't able to pay for his level of experience. Adams stumbled across a SpaceX booth at a career fair. His quality assurance experience with high-risk submarine systems fit nicely with his current role of minimizing and eliminating risk while testing second-stage rocket boosters.

SpaceX recruits employees with the skills and drive for making humans a multiplanetary species, said Brian Bjelde, vice president of human resources. In a statement, he described veterans as "smart, passionate and driven individuals who are committed to achieving that mission and they bring a wide array of skills that can be deployed in so many of our roles."
Ledford, the former artillery officer, was recruited via LinkedIn while earning his MBA at Baylor University. His grandfather worked at Vandenberg Air Force Base, where SpaceX launches some of its rockets. As a kid, Ledford read books on solar systems and built rockets out of Legos.
"I really couldn't believe it," he recalled of the cold call from SpaceX. "I was trying to hold back excitement."
Fuchs said he can find himself talking about his job for hours with friends and family.
"I didn't join the company knowing we're going to get this far," he said. "So to be part of that journey, to see what we've done so far and then to know the potential of what we have to go, is just incredibly exciting."
Former director general of Kerala Police T P Senkumar has come under sharp criticism for calling on the Muslim community to check growing religious extremism, and urging people not to draw false equivalence between the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Islamic State, the Indian Express has reported.
“There should be attempts from within the community to check religious extremism. When speaking about extremism, there is no sense speaking about the RSS. One cannot have a comparison between the RSS and the Islamic State,” Senkumar had said in an interview with Samakalika Malayalam on Saturday
“The problem surfaces when a Muslim is taught he should do jihad to attain heaven and that jihad is when one converts another into Islam and kills a non-Muslim,” he had argued during the interview. Senkumar had also raised concerns on the demographic change that the high birth rate among Muslims is bringing in Kerala. According to reports, out of the total 516,013 live births in Kerala, 41.45 per cent belong to the Muslim community, which forms only 26.56 per cent of the state's population. Senkumar cited similar figures.

Senkumar's comments triggered widespread protests, with Congress member of Parliament M I Shanavas accusing him of speaking on behalf of the RSS and calling for a case to be registered against him for “creating communal hatred”. Congress ally Indian Union Muslim League national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty also came out to attack Senkumar, echoing similar sentiments.
Senkumar was removed from his post after the new Left Democratic Front-led government was elected to power in the state. He was reinstated by the Supreme Court, which noted that the DGP was removed without 'reasonable cause'.

AUSTIN (KXAN) -- A man in his 30s died just after 10 p.m. Monday night after crashing into a telephone pole.
Police are now considering it a suspicious death at the 13200 block of northbound 183, near Hunter's Chase. A witness told KXAN they saw a car speeding on 183, before getting off near Spicewood where the man crashed in front of the Fiat dealership.

"The male driver of the involved vehicle was pronounced deceased on the scene," said Austin police officer Michael Endres. "The case is currently being investigated by detectives to determine the cause of this crash."
A 911 call around 10:30 p.m. alerted police there was a single-car crash with a potentially dead body. Police arrived to find a car crashed into a telephone pole and a man inside the car dead. According to a tweet by Austin/Travis County EMS, they tried to give him CPR.
The case has been ruled suspicious, but investigators have not said what they found at the scene to make the death out of the ordinary. Police have now cleared the scene of the crash.
It's been 82 days since Congress let funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program expire. For months legislators have promised the public they would get it done — certainly by end of the year — working on a deal that would reauthorize the program for the next five years, at the cost of $8 billion.
But in a stunning turn of events, the House of Representatives released a continuing appropriations bill Wednesday that would keep the government open and extends CHIP funding only until the end of March, at the extraordinary cost of $2.8 billion. In order to avoid a government shutdown, legislators have until midnight on Friday to fund the government.
In addition to shorting CHIP, the bill also does not grant legal protections to so-called Dreamers, children brought to the United States without documents whose legal status is in jeopardy. House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has been pressing Republicans to include the DREAM Act as part of the spending measure. Without it, Republicans will need to find the votes to keep the government open on their own.
Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi told The Intercept that Democrats are whipping their members to vote against the continuing resolution.
CHIP is a decades-old, federally funded program that makes health insurance available to families whose incomes are modest, but too high to qualify for Medicaid. It's long had strong bipartisan support, providing coverage to almost 9 million kids and 370,000 pregnant women.
“This may go down as the worst year for children in Congress in decades,” said Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, a children's advocacy group. “We are distraught for the families and nearly 9 million children who rely on CHIP for their health care. This action shows Congress's failure to prioritize and protect children and a very popular and successful program. It needlessly leaves states and families left in limbo.”
Whether Democrats would refuse to vote on a continuing resolution that extends CHIP funding for only three months remains unclear. In a Politico-Harvard poll released this month, Democratic voters said CHIP is their top legislative priority. Another Morning Consult/Politico poll showed that when voters were asked if CHIP reauthorization was important enough to prompt a government shutdown, 42 percent answered “yes definitely” and 25 percent answered “yes, maybe.” Among Democrats, 53 percent answered “yes definitely” and 24 percent answered “yes, maybe.”
The stakes for kids and expectant mothers are already sky-high. In a report released yesterday, researchers at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families found that if Congress does not reauthorize CHIP soon, about 1.9 million children could lose health insurance coverage in January. Several states, including Utah, Connecticut, and Virginia, have already sent out notices to inform CHIP enrollees that their coverage could end January 31. Georgetown researchers report that another 1 million children are at risk of losing their coverage by the end of February.
Earlier this week, Alabama's CHIP director announced that unless Congress acts soon, the state plans to freeze CHIP enrollment on January 1. (There are currently 84,000 children enrolled in the state, who also stand to lose coverage by the end of January.) History reveals that even temporary enrollment freezes can lead to major drops in coverage. Arizona's enrollment fell by more than 60 percent when the state temporarily froze the program in 2009, and North Carolina's enrollment fell by nearly 30 percent when it froze CHIP for 10 months in 2001.
Colorado, which is also set to end its CHIP program at the end of January if Congress doesn't reauthorize funding, has informed pregnant women who are scheduled to give birth in February that their health insurance will expire before they deliver.
Erin Miller, the vice president of health initiatives with the Colorado Children's Campaign told Public News Service that lapses in CHIP coverage could be financially devastating for families. “If they have a lapse in coverage and say their kid has asthma, and that kid can't get their meds, has to go to the emergency room and ends up admitted – that possible admission would cost them everything they have,” she said.

The legalization of marijuana is finally out of the mud with Reefer Madness defeated, yet few people discuss the true wonder of the “drug” – the introspection.
We've all heard enough on the physical health effects of ganja. Man has been keeping this plant around for centuries, for a reason.
I'm going to describe the incredible usefulness of smoking marijuana to induce powerful introspection, known only to the experienced user, and ineffable to those not bold enough to defy the “law.”
The brain seems to have the ability to compartmentalize thoughts. Distributing the work if you will. In doing so, power can be dedicated in isolation, hurdling the thinker either deeper into their mind, or toward sensory perception.
The amateur smoker will generally not understand this because the initial euphoria upon discovering the typically described “high” is just a shit load of fun at first. Laughter, smiling, profound independent realizations, etc. Over time, tolerance weakens this euphoria, but not so much the ability to efficiently divert power to isolated yet simultaneous thoughts.
An old man is walking down the street.
He stops, and you have a brief conversation. His age is revealed to be 85. After a few minutes, you part ways.
The conditioned sober brain generally moves on, or considers the old man for a few moments and returns back to the general observation of surroundings.
Here the stoned brain, known better to the experienced smoker, would analyze the encounter, which quite immediately induced introspection, a train off the rails. An ineffable experience.
You begin to consider what it would be like to be 85 years old. Whether you are currently 50, or 30, or 17, the mind leaps off the diving board into a now explorable ocean of inner reflection. What might it be like to exist for 85 odd years?
Ever drive down a long winding road, and suddenly return from a daydream? It seems impossible that you maintained control of the vehicle, but you did.
The enlightened stoner encounters this frequently. It can be highly beneficial to the evolution of a particular thought, but dangerous in the wrong circumstance. Inducing this while driving a car is poor, less so because of neglect, but more so because your brain is dedicating focus and power to an inner thought. This can be a lot of power, and it means you are not paying attention to subtle details on the road.
Imagine being a 14 -year-old, smoking poor-quality weed grown by whom the hell knows.
The adolescent brain is being tossed back and forth between introspection and reality, brought on by a poorly cultivated product. This is far less than ideal for today's teenager, someone with little life experience. Dealing with stress under these conditions would be quite difficult. The need for a mentor becomes apparent, as the mind becomes increasingly agitated by the lack of understanding and awareness about what is occurring in the mind.
The stereotype of the mannequin stoner on the couch, motionless and seemingly brain dead, is another example of potential misunderstanding. This person, though seemingly fried (and let's be serious, sometimes maybe they really are brain melted) may actually be lost in deep, deep introspective thought.
Consider how the sober person or amateur smoker may not know how to interpret this behavior, though an experienced pothead, often deep in the forest of their own mind, understands that this person is simply….thinking….a lot.
If the “weed” is embraced by society, its use could be taught, and you could create a legion of people who know an extra trick, a shortcut to a useful idea. And boy, do we need great ideas these days.
Soon marijuana will be fully legal to purchase, but what we really need is a mission to understand its usefulness on a cultural level, as an idea-generating catalyst. This is ancient wisdom of the past that has been pushed to the fringe.
We should embrace marijuana-induced introspection.
If you aren't a stoner, someone will need to explain this to you.

OCD: Dobermans to the Rescue
A gene linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder in dogs could lead to a better understanding of the condition in humans
By Catherine O'Neill Grace
Doberman pinschers may hold the genetic key for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans. While one in 50 adults suffers from OCD, engaging in repetitive behaviors like uncontrolled handwashing, it turns out that up to 70 percent of Doberman pups in any given litter and some 8 percent of all dogs have obsessive tendencies, such as compulsively sucking their flanks.
“This discovery could provide a better understanding of disease biology and facilitate development of genetic tests,” the researchers said. Photo: iStock
In a breakthrough that could help explain human OCD and lead to better treatments or prevention for the anxiety disorder, researchers have located the gene for obsessive-compulsive disorder in Dobermans—the first behavioral gene identified in dogs.
Nicholas Dodman, director of the Animal Behavior Program at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, and colleagues from the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard found that Dobermans that exhibit compulsive behaviors have a gene, located on canine chromosome 7, that predisposes them to OCD.
“We don't know for certain that it's the gene that causes OCD in people, but what we did find out is that the same gene exists in humans on chromosome 18, which has the reputation of being the ‘psychiatric' gene,” says Dodman, lead author on the research, published in the January 2010 issue of Nature's Molecular Psychiatry.
The implications are profound. “This discovery could provide a better understanding of disease biology and facilitate development of genetic tests, enabling earlier interventions and even treatment or prevention of compulsive disorders in at-risk canines and humans,” the researchers wrote.
“The occurrence of repetitive behaviors and similarities in response to drug treatments in both canine compulsive disorder and human OCD suggest that common pathways are involved,” says Edward I. Ginns, director of the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and a study co-author.
“That moment changed our lives,” Nicholas Dodman says. “I decided that behavior was what I wanted to do.”
A Eureka Moment
Dodman's interest in compulsive behaviors goes back nearly 30 years, when he joined the veterinary faculty at Tufts as an anesthesiologist. He and Louis Shuster, a pharmacologist and now professor emeritus at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, started examining repetitive behaviors in horses. Their eureka moment came courtesy of a palomino horse named Poker's Queen Bee.
The palomino was prone to cribbing, a behavior in which a horse grips an edge (a fence, grain bin or stall) with its front teeth, arches its neck and gulps in air—over and over and over again. “In some thoroughbred barns, over 30 percent of horses indulge in cribbing,” says Dodman. “I wondered why these animals, in the pressure cooker of modern domestic horse life, were doing this.”
He and Shuster already knew that when horses are given increasing doses of morphine, they begin to pace in circles. They hypothesized that cribbing horses might be responding to what Dodman calls “nature's own morphine,” or the endorphins that their bodies release under stress. The researchers administered a morphine-blocking drug to Poker's Queen Bee, and the horse's cribbing stopped, suddenly and completely.
“That moment changed our lives,” Dodman recalls. “I decided that behavior was what I wanted to do.” Shuster, who had been studying drugs of abuse, focused his research on repetitive behaviors, and the horse's owner left her high-profile executive job to pursue graduate studies in pharmacology.
Dodman went on to examine compulsive behaviors in cats and dogs, particularly in Doberman pinschers and bull terriers, which are also at risk for OCD. “Veterinarians had long observed dogs engaging in stone chewing, nail biting, blanket sucking, pacing and so on,” Dodman says. “They do all kinds of weird stuff. But nobody knew what was causing it.”
Dodman says the technology is in place to give researchers a better idea of how the genetic variations in dogs with canine compulsive disorder affect brain function—and to develop diagnostic tests and new treatments.
Now the research team is collaborating with scientists at the National Institute of Mental Health to determine how closely the genetic markers they identified are associated with a risk for human OCD and autism spectrum disorders, a developmental disability that hampers social interaction and communication.

Mr Wallace became besotted with Ms Stelzer after meeting her at a Sydney club around the time he separated from his first wife, and they married seven years later in 2005. They drafted a prenuptial agreement that said Mr Wallace would pay Ms Stelzer $3.25 million if their relationship broke down in the first four years, and within two years, it did. But Mr Wallace, who has a net worth of more than $16 million, is now claiming that the agreement is invalid. He claims Ms Stelzer, who owns just over $10,000 in assets, behaved fraudulently when she professed before their marriage that she loved him, wanted to have children with him and spend the rest of her life with him. He also says his original solicitor never gave him proper advice on the pros and cons of entering a prenuptial agreement, and took just minutes to sign off his version, commenting only that it was a lot of money.
Mr Wallace's current solicitor, Trevor Hall, said the weakness of the legislation meant no financial agreement signed between couples was safe. ''Every binding financial agreement ever entered into is at some risk of being set aside if years later a spouse wants to suggest that the advice they received was not proper advice,'' Mr Hall said. In 2004, the federal government introduced changes to the Family Law Act that required solicitors to certify they had taken certain steps to ensure their clients understood their agreements. But it gave way to a rash of litigation, with people attempting to avoid their obligations on the basis their lawyers had not followed those steps meticulously. In 2010, the government relaxed the wording, but Mr Wallace claims the law still doesn't ensure proper advice has been given, and the changes should not apply to his action retrospectively, as that is unconstitutional. Judge Robert Benjamin upheld the validity of Mr Wallace's prenuptial agreement in 2011, saying his case was coloured by criticism of Ms Stelzer, whose evidence he preferred. ''At many levels this criticism seemed to endeavour to demean her and their relationship, bearing in mind the wife's initial occupation and the circumstances of their meeting,'' Judge Benjamin said.
Mr Wallace appealed to the full bench of the Family Court. The appeal has alarmed the federal Attorney-General for its potential to affect thousands of other such agreements if it stands on constitutional grounds or on the basis that the legislation is weak. In December, former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett launched legal action against his former solicitors, claiming they had botched his prenuptial agreement with his wife and mother of his two children, Candice Alley. Divorce lawyer Duncan Holmes said more people were challenging their agreements on the basis of inadequate legal advice, and lawyers were concerned about their liability. Senior counsel were demanding $8000 to $10,000 just to look at them, he said.
''The legislation is in disaster territory,'' Mr Holmes said. ''Well-intentioned legislation is getting corrupted and lawyers are running scared.'' A family lawyer, Susan Pearson, said the agreements no longer offered enough protection to justify drafting them. Part of the reason they were overturned came down to differing interpretations by judges, but other times what was drafted many years ago was no longer considered to be fair, she said.
If you've ever been worried about your booze intake, this will make you reconsider just how much you drink at every happy hour, bachelorette party, birthday—basically, anything where alcohol is involved: Excessive alcohol use counts for 10 percent of deaths for adults between the ages of 20 and 64, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To find these estimates, scientists from the CDC analyzed data from the Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) application for 2006 to 2010. The ARDI provides national and state counts of alcohol-attributable deaths and estimates how many years of your life are stripped away due to drinking.
Shockingly, there were approximately 88,000 deaths per year in that four-year time frame. Some of these were attributed to long-term health effects where alcohol was a factor (breast cancer, liver disease, and heart disease) while others were the result of alcohol-related incidents (violence, alcohol poisoning, and motor vehicle crashes). But here's the real scary statistic: Overall, there were 2.5 million years of potential life lost each year.
MORE: The Number of Calories You Consume Because of Binge Drinking Will Blow Your Mind
Not to sound like a broken record, but we feel like this needs to be reiterated: Zero benefits are associated with excessive alcohol consumption. If these numbers weren't enough, remember that the World Heath Organization recently reported that dangerous alcohol use was responsible for 3.3 million deaths worldwide in 2012. So it goes without saying that you should always imbibe responsibly. This means abiding by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines for moderate drinking (three or fewer drinks in one night), avoiding all forms of alcohol while pregnant, and never getting behind the wheel while intoxicated.

Another local brewery should be open by “the time the snow melts.”
'20s-era building
Construction on Creston Brewery starts this month in the former DeKorne Furniture Showroom in Grand Rapids' Creston Business District, at 1504 Plainfield Ave. NE.
“This building is an absolute treasure of Grand Rapids history,” said Scott Schultz, one of the brewery's co-founders. “It was built in the 1920s as a furniture manufacturer and showroom in Furniture City, U.S.A. and is now being re-purposed almost a century later as a microbrewery and taproom in Beer City, U.S.A.
“This historical significance is palpable, something we intend to celebrate in every way imaginable.”
Schultz is joined by partners Molly Bouwsma-Schultz, Vincent Lambert and Cailin Kelly.
Along with a 20-barrel brew system, Creston Brewery will also feature a taproom, restaurant and entertainment venue.
Menu
The restaurant will feature a locally sourced menu of burritos, tacos, bowls, nachos and salads with “many seasonal and creative twists.”
The menu will be designed for pairing with beer, hard cider and wine.
Neighborhood brewery
Kelly said Creston Brewery's beer, food, entertainment and employees will reflect the diversity of the neighborhood.
“Creston is the largest neighborhood in Grand Rapids, and its demographics reflect this beautiful city we all share,” Lambert said. “The neighborhood is economically, socially and culturally diverse and that's why we were driven to start our brewery here.
“We want to create prosperity, enrich people's lives and give everyone a reason to celebrate life's simple pleasures every single day in a beautiful setting and affordable prices.”
In literature, graphic descriptions of menace and dismemberment by monsters are as old as Beowulf and much, much older still, though it wasn't until Horace Walpole's 18th century novel The Castle of Otranto inspired the gothic romance novel that horror-qua-horror came into fashion. Without Walpole, and better-known gothic innovators like Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker, we'd likely never have had Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, or Stephen King. But nowadays when we think of horror, we usually think of film—and all of its various contemporary subgenres, including creepy psychological twists on good-old-fashion monster movies, like The Babadook.
But from whence came the horror film? Was it 1931, a banner horror year in which audiences saw both Boris Karloff in James Whale's Frankenstein and Bela Lugosi in Tod Browning's Dracula? Certainly classic films by masters of the genre, but they did not originate the horror movie. There is, of course, F.W. Murnau's terrifying silent Nosferatu from 1922 (and the real life horror of its deceased director's missing head).
And what about German expressionism? “A case can be made,” argued Roger Ebert, that Robert Weine's 1920 The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari “was the first true horror film”—a “subjective psychological fantasy” in which “unspeakable horror becomes possible.” Perhaps. But even before Weine's still-effectively-disorienting cinematic work disturbed audiences worldwide, there was Paul Wegener's first, 1915 version of The Golem, a character, writes Penn State's Kevin Jack Hagopian, that served as “one of the most significant ancestors to the cinematic Frankenstein of James Whale and Boris Karloff.“ Even earlier, in 1910, Thomas Edison produced an adaptation of Mary Shelley's monster story.
So how far back do we have to go to find the first horror movie? Almost as far back as the very origins of film, it seems—to 1896, when French special-effects genius Georges Méliès made the three plus minute short above, Le Manoir du Diable (The Haunted Castle, or the Manor of the Devil). Méliès, known for his silent sci-fi fantasy A Trip to the Moon—and for the tribute paid to him in Martin Scorsese's Hugo—used his innovative methods to tell a story, writes Maurice Babbis at Emerson University journal Latent Image, of “a large bat that flies into a room and transforms into Mephistopheles. He then stands over a cauldron and conjures up a girl along with some phantoms and skeletons and witches, but then one of them pulls out a crucifix and the demon disappears.” Not much of a story, granted, and it's not particularly scary, but it is an excellent example of a technique Méliès supposedly discovered that very year. According to Earlycinema.com,
In the Autumn of 1896, an event occurred which has since passed into film folklore and changed the way Méliès looked at filmmaking. Whilst filming a simple street scene, Méliès camera jammed and it took him a few seconds to rectify the problem. Thinking no more about the incident, Méliès processed the film and was struck by the effect such a incident had on the scene - objects suddenly appeared, disappeared or were transformed into other objects.
Thus was born The Haunted Castle, technically the first horror film, and one of the first movies—likely the very first—to deliberately use special effects to frighten its viewers.

Will robots take our jobs and leave us in a high-unemployment robopocalypse? Not if Rodney Brooks has anything to say about it. In this ten-minute TED Talk, Brooks explains how he sees robotics helping humans take on daily tasks. Specifically, he shows how an assembly line robot called Baxter can be programmed by factory workers to automate some of the most mundane tasks seen on the assembly line. He even demonstrates the programming process onstage, proving how such a robot can be made humane (for instance, it doesn't crush the puny human trying to use it).
This is a stark contrast to the typical assembly robots we see in today's assembly line manufacturing, where in some cases the machines have eradicated a whole category of jobs (auto manufacturing comes to mind). Not only are those robots hard to create, program, and manage -- they're also downright dangerous to be around. Brooks addresses these machines specifically, saying, "I think it's a sort of technology that's gone wrong -- it's displaced the worker from the technology. I think we need to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with."
In case you don't know who Brooks is, he has serious robot cred. He cofounded iRobot (maker of the Roomba, the most-used robot in my house); he wrote the influential robotics paper Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control (later made into one of my favorite documentaries, in which he's featured); and he was director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory for a decade. This man knows robots. Now listen up:
For a little more context, check out Brooks speaking at TED ten years ago, showing off the Roomba, among other robots. Seriously awesome stuff, and kind of amazing to see how something that was magical ten years ago is just normal now. What will we think is totally normal in ten years?

Men who ate fruits and vegetables with higher levels of pesticide residues — such as strawberries, spinach, and peppers — had lower sperm counts and lower percentages of normal sperm than those who ate produce with lower residue levels, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. It is the first study to look at the connection between exposure to pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables and semen quality.
The study appeared online today in the journal Human Reproduction.
“To our knowledge, this is the first report to link consumption of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables, a primary exposure route for most people, to an adverse reproductive health outcome in humans,” said Jorge Chavarro, assistant professor of nutrition and epidemiology and the study's senior author.
Numerous studies had shown that consuming conventionally grown fruits and vegetables resulted in measurable pesticide levels in urine. Other studies had uncovered associations between occupational and environmental exposure to pesticides and lower semen quality. But only a few studies had linked consumption of pesticide residues in food to health effects, and none had looked at the effects on semen quality.
The researchers used data from 155 men enrolled in the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) study, an ongoing National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences-funded study at a fertility center in Boston. Data included 338 semen samples provided between 2007 and 2012 and validated survey information about participants' diets. The researchers classified fruits and vegetables according to whether they contained high amounts of pesticide residues (such as peppers, spinach, strawberries, apples, and pears) or low-to-moderate amounts (such as peas, beans, grapefruit, and onions), based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Pesticide Data Program. They then adjusted for factors such as smoking and body mass index — both known to affect sperm quality — and looked for connections between the men's intake of produce with pesticide residue and the quality of their sperm.
The results showed that men who ate greater amounts of fruits and vegetables with higher levels of pesticide residue — more than 1.5 servings per day — had 49 percent lower sperm count and 32 percent lower percentage of normal sperm than men who ate the least (less than 0.5 serving per day). They also had a lower sperm counts, lower ejaculate volumes, and lower percentages of normal sperm.
The men who ate the most fruits and vegetables with low-to-moderate levels of pesticide residue had higher percentages of normal sperm than those who ate less fruits and vegetables with low-to-moderate levels.
“These findings should not discourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables in general,” said Chavarro. “In fact, we found that consuming more fruits and vegetables with low pesticide residues was beneficial. This suggests that implementing strategies specifically targeted at avoiding pesticide residues, such as consuming organically grown produce or avoiding produce known to have large amounts of residues, may be the way to go.”
Other Harvard Chan School researchers involved in the study included lead author Yu-Han Chiu, Myriam Afeiche, Audrey Gaskins, Paige Williams, and Russ Hauser.
Funding for the study came from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health grants, and Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award.

WSU scientists discover mechanism for air pollution-induced liver disease
September 2, 2015
DETROIT - A research team led by Kezhong Zhang, Ph.D., at the Wayne State University School of Medicine's Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, has discovered that exposure to air pollution has a direct adverse health effect on the liver and causes liver fibrosis, an illness associated with metabolic disease and liver cancer.
Dr. Zhang, assistant professor of Molecular Medicine and Genetics and of Immunology and Microbiology, and his group have been studying the adverse health effects of air pollution from a unique perspective. While the major research efforts in the field were focused on the effects of air pollution on lung tissues and cardiovascular system, the Zhang lab studied the pathological effects and stress mechanisms of air pollution on the liver, the major organ of detoxification and metabolism. Their work demonstrated that inhalation exposure to high-concentration airborne particulate matter PM 2.5 has direct effects on the liver, triggering liver fibrosis, a pathological condition characterized by accumulation of the extracellular matrix protein collagen that occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases.
PM 2.5 is fine airborne particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometers. It is a complex mixture of particles and gases from gasoline and diesel engines, together with dust from wear of road surfaces, tires and brakes. PM 2.5 is the major and most toxic component of air pollutants in the real-world air environment of intensive traffic or industrial activity. Recent epidemiological studies confirmed that populations exposed to high-level PM 2.5 are at a higher risk of developing heart disease and metabolic disease.
Dr. Zhang said that PM 2.5 pollution has major impact on the public health for the general population in urban areas, such as Detroit, one of the most PM 2.5 -polluted cities in the United States, according to annual air quality reports by the American Lung Association.
Dr. Zhang's group, in collaboration with a research group at the Ohio State University College of Public Health led by Qinghua Sun, M.D., Ph.D., professor and assistant dean for Global Public Health, performed both short-time and long-term inhalation exposure of animal models to real-world PM 2.5 . After a 10-week exposure, the animals developed liver fibrosis. Utilizing molecular, cellular and pathological approaches, the team discovered the stress sensor on the cell membrane that initiates PM 2.5 -triggered stress signals and the mediators inside the cell that transduces the signaling. The PM 2.5 -triggered inflammatory stress responses promote collagen deposition -- a hallmark of fibrosis -- in the liver through activating the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling. This work will soon be published in the Journal of Hepatology. The ahead of publication edition of the paper is online at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827815005115.
“Our work has a major impact on medical care and health policy-making for the populations under air pollution environment,” Dr. Zhang said, “Liver fibrosis is an advanced stage of chronic liver injuries caused by chronic hepatitis viral infection, obesity, alcoholism or autoimmune diseases. Our work defined that air pollution, specifically PM 2.5 pollutant, is an independent risk factor of liver fibrosis. This is very significant in terms of identifying new health risk factors and understanding liver diseases. The molecular and cellular mechanisms we revealed in this work have very important implications in clinical disease diagnosis and treatment associated with air pollution.”
The liver is an important target organ and a key player in disease development under high-level PM 2.5 exposure. Automobile drivers who experience long-time daily road traffic and car manufacturing employees should pay more attention to the markers or liver enzymes that indicate liver disease, Dr. Zhang said. “Physicians or health care professionals should monitor liver pathology and consider preventive therapeutic strategies for liver disease for populations and patients in urban air pollution environments.”
Previous publications from the Zhang group related to the effects of air pollution on the liver were the subjects of editorial focus or commentary in the American Journal of Physiology and Journal of Hepatology.
Dr. Zhang is the project's principal investigator. Other researchers at the Wayne State University School of Medicine who contributed to this work include the paper's first author, Ze Zheng, Ph.D., and Xuebao Zhang, research associate; Jiemei Wang, Ph.D., assistant professor of Molecular Medicine and Genetics; Aditya Dandekar, Ph.D.; Hyunbae Kim, research associate; and Yining Qiu; Ph.D. The project is funded by that National Institutes of Health's National Environmental Health Science Institute (grant Nos.

Return to news
Tourists use a selfie stick to take a photo of themselves in front of a large portrait of late Chinese leader Mao Zedong on the Gate of Heavenly Peace near Tiananmen Square in Beijing. AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein A lot of this year's slump in commodity prices is being tracked back to the massive ructions in the Chinese economy. It's slowing down, and demand for the materials that have fuelled its astonishing boom is trickling away.
But according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, it's not all bad. In fact, the way China's consuming commodities indicates that the country's enormous economic transition is working, not failing.
Some commodities, like iron ore or cement, are necessary for massive industrialisation, and Chinese demand for them exploded during the boom years. Goldman's note refers to them as capex (capital expenditure) commodities.
Growth in others, like gasoline and coffee (opex or operational expenditure commodities) indicate that something else is going on — that a population is getting richer, and spending more on things like food and personal travel.
In China, consumption of capex commodities is slumping, against rapid growth in opex commodity consumption.
The more capex-intensive the commodity, the weaker the demand growth, while the more opex-intensive the commodity, the stronger the demand growth. Demand has declined by 5.0% for cement, yet demand for gasoline is up 19.1%. This pattern suggests that policymakers are, at least to a degree, successfully creating the conditions for the much-anticipated rotation in economic growth away from investment and towards consumption.
And that's pretty important. Beijing is currently trying to rotate away from being the world's investment-heavy, export-driven industrial powerhouse and towards an economy more driven by domestic consumption and services. That's how the country will stop itself getting stuck in the middle income trap— policymakers hope.
Here's how growth in demand in different commodities looks, with those used most intensively for fixed investment (bottom) to those used most intensively by consumers (top). It's a clear relationship:
Goldman Sachs
It's impossible to say whether the sort of growth seen in the opex commodities is enough to allow China's economy to transition. It's the biggest economy in the world by purchasing power parity, and probably the largest single test of development economics in the history of the world.
But the figures are at least all heading in the right direction.
Two graphs that should really scare us
Both of these come from the International Monetary Fund's new paper (pdf) on employment, which is graph-tastic. The first looks at the long-term effect unemployment has on the average male's long-term earnings.
So a 25-year-old worker whose firm went under in 2008 will still be earning less than the guy in the office park across from him whose firm barely rode out the recession. We tend to think of employment as being binary: You have a job, or you don't. But it's more complicated than that. Losing a job has lingering effects, and not just on income. It also raises your risk of death going forward:
This is one reason that jobs-sharing proposals like the one Germany implemented make some real sense: Keeping the maximum number of people in their jobs -- even if you temporarily reduce their hours or wages -- means fewer people losing their jobs altogether. That means their skills don't deteriorate, it means they're less likely to have to take a new job that they're not as good at or where they're paid a lot less, it means they don't have to explain away their unemployment to prospective employers, and so on.
Denver's annual marijuana event known as 4/20 is just around the corner, and with the advent of legal recreational marijuana use in Colorado, questions have arisen as to how the event will be handled.
Is it still a protest to be viewed as a First Amendment exercise now that it's legal? How will police handle public consumption, forbidden by the state constitutional amendment that legalized recreational weed? How will the event affect the city's image?
We posed these questions and others to representatives from both sides of the debate over the 4/20 event, held in Denver's Civic Center each April 20, in interviews on The Roundup, a public affairs discussion conducted by The Denver Post's editorial board.
Charlie Brown, a Denver City Council member, said he was opposed to public consumption of marijuana in the park and believes it shouldn't be tolerated. He doesn't believe there is anything left to protest, as it were, since marijuana consumption is legal if done in the privacy of one's home.
Miguel Lopez, organizer of the 4/20 event, said the issue of federal law, which still classifies marijuana consumption as a crime, remains one to be protested. And he hoped the city would respect attendees who would peacefully assemble and smoke marijuana.
In his meticulous diaries, written from 1846 to 1882, the Harvard librarian John Langdon Sibley complains often about the withering summer heat: “The heat wilts & enervates me & makes me sick,” he wrote in 1852. Sibley lived before the age of air-conditioning, but recent research suggests that his observation is still accurate: summer really does tend to be a time of reduced productivity. Our brains do, figuratively, wilt.
One of the key issues is motivation: when the weather is unpleasant, no one wants to go outside, but when the sun is shining, the air is warm, and the sky is blue, leisure calls. A 2008 study using data from the American Time Use Survey found that, on rainy days, men spent, on average, thirty more minutes at work than they did on comparatively sunny days. In 2012, a group of researchers from Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill conducted a field study of Japanese bank workers and found a similar pattern: bad weather made workers more productive, as measured by the time it took them to complete assigned tasks in a loan-application process.
When the weather improved, in contrast, productivity fell. To determine why this was the case, the researchers assigned Harvard students data entry on either sunny or rainy days. The students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: before starting to work, they were either shown six photographs of outdoor activities in nice weather, such as sailing or eating outdoors, or were asked to describe their daily routines. The researchers found that participants were less productive when they'd viewed pleasant outdoor photographs. Instead of focussing on their work, they focussed on what they'd rather be doing—whether or not it was actually sunny or rainy outside (though the effect was stronger on sunny days). The mere thought of pleasant alternatives made people concentrate less.
But each season has its share of attractive days—and a skier's mind would likely have many opportunities to wander in the dead of winter. There's evidence, however, that in summer, our thinking itself may simply become lazier. In 1994, Gerald Clore, a pioneer in researching how ambient mood-altering phenomena affect cognition and judgment, found that pleasant weather can often lead to a disconcerting lapse in thoughtfulness. Clore's team approached a hundred and twenty-two undergraduates on days with either good or bad weather and asked them to participate in a survey on higher education. The better the weather, the easier it was to get the students to buy into a less-than-solid argument: on days that were sunny, clear, and warm, people were equally persuaded by both strong and weak arguments in favor of end-of-year comprehensive exams. When the weather was rainy, cloudy, and cold, their critical faculties improved: in that condition, only the strong argument was persuasive. Clore and his colleagues concluded that pleasant weather led people to embrace more heuristic-based thinking—that is, they relied heavily on mental shortcuts at the expense of actual analysis.
Summer weather—especially the muggy kind—may also reduce both our attention and our energy levels. In one study, high humidity lowered concentration and increased sleepiness among participants. The weather also hurt their ability to think critically: the hotter it got, the less likely they were to question what they were told.
The shift toward mindlessness may be rooted in our emotions. One common finding is a link between relative sunshine and happiness: although people who live in sunnier places, like Southern California, are no happier than those who live in the harsher conditions of the Midwest, day-to-day variations in sunshine make a difference. People get happier as days get longer and warmer in the approach to the summer solstice, and less happy as days get colder and shorter. They also report higher life satisfaction on relatively pleasant days. The happiest season, then, is summer.
A good mood, generally speaking, has in turn been linked to the same type of heuristic, relatively mindless thinking that Clore observed in his pleasant-weather participants. On the flip side, a bad mood tends to stimulate more rigorous analytical thought. Weather-related mood effects can thus play out in our real-life decisions—even weighty ones. In one recent project, the psychologist Uri Simonsohn found that students were more likely to enroll in a university that was famous for its academic rigor if they visited on days that were cloudy. When the weather turned sour, he concluded, the value they placed on academics increased.
There's a limit, however, to heat's ability to boost our mood: when temperatures reach the kind of summer highs that mark heat waves all over the world, the effect rapidly deteriorates. In a 2013 study of perceived well-being, the economist Marie Connolly found that on days when the temperature rose above ninety degrees, the negative impact on happiness levels was greater than the consequences of being widowed or divorced.
Conversely, the effects of heat on our brains aren't entirely negative. Many of the behaviors that psychologists study follow a so-called inverted-U pattern: as one factor steadily increases, a related behavior improves, plateaus, and then starts to deteriorate. A famous example of this is the Yerkes-Dodson curve, which charts the effect of stress on how well someone performs a given task. If we experience too little stress, or too much, our performance suffers. Like Goldilocks, we want to get it just right. Similarly, our cognitive abilities seem to improve up to a certain temperature, and then, as the temperature continues to rise, quickly diminish. An early study suggested that the optimal temperature hovered around seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit. A more recent review of the literature shows a target of twenty-seven degrees Celsius, or roughly eighty-one degrees Fahrenheit. (An important caveat, however, is that neither of these studies take humidity or sunshine into account, two major factors when it comes to assessing the influence of summer weather on behavior.)
Maybe best of all, blistering heat does give us a perfectly good reason to eat ice cream: studies have shown again and again that blood glucose levels are tied to cognitive performance and willpower. A bite of something frozen and sweet, boosting depleted glucose stores, might be just what a brain needs as the temperature spikes.

Miracle on Lark Street: updated zoning proposal a win for neighborhood, future
Joe Bonilla Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 23, 2016
A miracle took place on Lark Street last night (two if you include no fatalities from a fire at the corner of Hamilton Street).
As you may be aware of, the City of Albany has proposed an overhaul to the city's mid-century-era zoning regulations (ReZone Albany) to ultimately make the city more competitive for development, as well as provided much-needed clarity for a property owner or developer to move forward with a project. The initiative, which launched just over two years ago, has largely been a collaborative and public process with input from residents, businesses, and advocates.
However, the concern that I wrote about, echoed by a chorus of the voices in, around, and outside of Lark Street was the proposed hours of operation — namely 11 p.m. for the adjacent Dove Street corridor and 2 a.m. for the Lark Street corridor itself — for businesses. This would have reverted establishments such as Palais Royale to the original code rather than its allowed closing time of 4 a.m. At one point, the proposal would have called for Market 32, Dunkin' Donuts, Dunbrook Mobil, and convenience stores within the district to close at 2 a.m. and to reopen later in the morning (this has since been changed).
We've come a long way from early November. Since that time, discussions between city officials, the Lark Street Business Improvement District, and involved parties have led to what can be seen as a victory not only for Lark Street, but for Albany in terms of how rapid and responsive the changes sought were modified.
We've also seen the rise of a Lark Street activated and prepared to advocate for what they want to see out of the street.
So on Thursday night at Cafe Hollywood — right before Christmas weekend — in front of dozens and dozens of concerned residents, businesses, and observers, the Department of Planning (which has worked tirelessly to help expedite the changes) announced positive and significant changes to the draft proposal which includes allowing existing establishments that are currently allowed to be open to 4 a.m. to retain this right, so long as the business type remains the same. For others, this will also mean if they have an allowance to be open until 11 p.m., the establishment can theoretically be open until 2 a.m.
The proposal in full will require Common Council approval, which is expected early in 2017.
Some have made mention that this may drive business or potential investment away from the street. I would argue that this is not the case, given that existing establishments will essentially go on with business as usual. Lark Street remains an avenue of opportunity for a budding entrepreneur and with these changes along with the rest of the ReZone proposal, the future remains strong for Albany's village in the city.
This is a miracle those who love Lark Street can be thankful for this holiday season.
(Reuters) - As oil prices nosedived by two-thirds since 2014, a belief took hold in global energy markets that for prices to recover, many U.S. shale producers would first have to falter to allow markets to rebalance.

With U.S. oil prices now trading below $40 a barrel, the corporate casualties are already mounting. More than 50 North American oil and gas producers have entered bankruptcy since early 2015, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings and other data. While those firms account for only about 1 percent of U.S. output, based on the analysis, that count is expected to rise. Consultant Deloitte says a third of shale producers face bankruptcy risks this year.
But a Reuters analysis has found that bankruptcies are so far having little effect on U.S. oil production, and a tendency among distressed drillers to keep their oil wells gushing belies the notion that deepening financial distress will prompt a sudden output decline or oil price rebound.
Texas-based Magnum Hunter Resources MHRCQ.PK, the second-largest producer among publicly-traded companies that have filed for bankruptcy, is a case in point.
It filed for creditor protection last December, but even as the debt-laden driller scrambled to avoid that outcome, its oil and gas production rose by nearly a third between mid-2014 and late 2015, filings show.
Once in Chapter 11, its CEO Gary Evans said the bankruptcy, which injected new funds to ensure it would stay operational, could help to “position Magnum Hunter as a market leader.”
The company did not respond to a request for comment for this story. However, John Castellano, a restructuring specialist at Alix Partners, said that all of the nearly 3,000 wells in which Magnum Hunter owns stakes have continued operations during its bankruptcy.
Production figures can be hard to track post-bankruptcy, but restructuring specialists say that many bankrupt drillers keep pumping oil at full tilt. Their creditors see that as the best way to recover some of what they are owed. And as many bankrupt firms seek to sell assets, operating wells are valued more than idled ones.
“Oil companies in bankruptcy do not seem to automatically curtail production,” said restructuring expert Jason Cohen, a partner at the Bracewell firm in Houston. “Lenders are willing to let them continue to produce as long as economically viable.”
For most companies in bankruptcy or considering it, maximizing near-term production does make economic sense. Day-to-day well operating costs in most U.S. shale fields remain well below $40 a barrel. Bankrupt firms are also eligible for new financing that can allow them to keep pumping for some time.
50 AND COUNTING
At least 20 publicly traded companies have filed for creditor protection since the start of 2015. They held at least 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in production, according to their last disclosed annual output figures. Another 30 or so privately held companies also have gone bust, in what already is the biggest wave of North American bankruptcies since the subprime mortgage crisis.
They account for just over 1 percent of U.S. output, but the figure is set to grow with banks expected to slash credit lines to energy firms in their biannual review of borrowing limits in April.
In what could become the most high-profile reorganization in the sector, Oklahoma City-based SandRidge Energy IncSDOC.PK confirmed on Wednesday that it has hired advisers to review its options, including a bankruptcy filing.
About a million barrels of U.S. oil production, over a tenth of the total, is under the control of firms considered “financially challenged” estimates Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors Llc.
Yet even if many more firms go bust, production is not expected to fall much.
“I could see (bankruptcies) as a marginal contributor to lower supply, but if you ask me could it ever move the needle, the answer is no,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.
The reason is the remarkable gains in productivity of U.S. oil rigs in recent years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that a well drilled late in 2015 produces twice as much as one from late 2013.
As a result, the EIA forecasts output will only drop 7 percent this year to 8.7 million bpd, even after U.S. oil and gas producers have shed more than 100,000 jobs, slashed spending and idled 75 percent of rigs since the end of 2014.
Many bankrupt firms can sustain their output thanks to so-called debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing for operating and other expenses made available by existing creditors, banks, or private equity firms.
Magnum Hunter, for example, received $200 million in DIP funding, and so far is being run by the same management as before its bankruptcy.
Many distressed producers have also drawn down their credit facilities or skipped bond payments prior to filing to conserve cash.
Among the companies reviewed by Reuters, Swift Energy Co SFYWQ.PK, Samson Resources Corp and American Eagle Energy Corp Co AMZGQ.PK all chose to skip interest payments ahead of bankruptcy filings, citing ongoing talks with lenders to restructure their debt.
With operating expenses for existing U.S. shale wells between $17 and $23 per barrel, most companies can keep pumping unless oil falls below $20 per barrel, says David Zusman, chief investment officer of Talara Capital Management.
What bankrupt and financially stretched producers are unable to do is drill new wells and since output from shale wells can fall as much as 70 percent during their first year, a sustained lull in drilling would gradually erode U.S. production.
Ultimately, the number of bankruptcies may matter less than the lack of funding. The lending reviews now underway are likely to leave more companies without sufficient credit to finance new drilling, analysts say.
“We could see a 150,000-200,000 bpd fall in oil production if financially challenged producers were to slow spending,” said Thummel.
Firm receives £250,000 a year from government while also providing paid-for advice to GPs affected by changes
A global consultancy firm seeking to profit out of the fallout from the shake-up to the NHS is being paid £250,000 a year by the government for advice on the transition towards health secretary Andrew Lansley's vision of the service.
The American firm, McKinsey Inc, with estimated revenues of £4.1bn a year, has been advising the Department of Health on how best to manage the radical changes since March. McKinsey is also one of a group of private consultants that have united to provide paid-for advice to GPs as they prepare for life after the reforms.
Family doctors need help from private companies because of the government's decision to abolish primary care trusts as part of their controversial changes to the health service, a move criticised as a step towards privatisation.
McKinsey's advisory services emerged in freedom of information release published on the department's website. The job description says: "Consultancy services in support of the NHS transition programme".
The company was one of 57 external "organisation and change" management consultants paid almost £5.5m by the government in the last financial year.
It is unclear how McKinsey is assisting. However, in September this newspaper revealed the company had been acting as a middleman between Lansley's department and international firms, including the German company Helios, which was at one time interested in taking over selected NHS hospitals.
Christina McAnea, head of health at the Unison union, said the revelation was evidence of the increasing hold private companies had over health policy. She said: "It is clear that the Tory government's direction of travel for the NHS is towards privatisation and they are increasingly open about that.
"But what is also becoming obvious is the close relationships being built between this Conservative government and the private companies who are making, or want to make, a profit from the reforms in the health and social care bill. It is worrying for everyone, but particularly patients, because this is money that should be spent on their care."
The total paid to consultants by the department, including IT and legal professionals, in the last year was £9.7m, despite the government's claims to be cutting down on extraneous spending on management consultancy firms.
The department is currently employing 114 contractors, and leaked documents seen by the Observer reveal the generous daily rates of pay the government is now offering private firms for their advice.
The government rate card shows that consultants can earn up to £1,870 a day each working for the civil service. A junior consultant can earn £400 a day. A three-month contract for a top consultant could net their company almost £120,000 for just 60 days' work.
Gareth Thomas, Labour's shadow minister for civil society, said: "When the rest of the country is struggling to make ends meet and jobs are being axed, the government should be clamping down on excessive pay to consultants. Ministers need to be transparent and explain why so many consultants on such high pay are needed and whether they approved these contracts or not."
McKinsey has long been a controversial figure in the health world, and has made millions of pounds as one of the key private providers of management and advisory services. A conglomerate including McKinsey, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers last week sealed a £7.1m contract with 31 groups of GPs looking for advice on how to manage budgets under the system being introduced by the Lansley reforms.
Earlier this summer this newspaper revealed the existence of confidential emails between McKinsey and the government showing that the firm had helped the department to hold discussions last year about "international players" running up to 20 NHS hospitals.
The emails suggested there had been "good discussions" on "how international hospital provider groups may help to tackle the performance improvement of English hospitals".
It said there was "interest in [a] new solution for 10 to 20 hospitals", but said this would be "starting from a mindset of one at a time" due to "various political constraints".
The consultants suggested that a figure of £500m revenue "on the table" and a "free hand on staff management" would be needed for "international players" to run hospitals.
Private involvement has been suggested as a solution for NHS trusts with financial difficulties that may not be able to attain foundation trust status. One hospital trust, Hinchingbrooke Health Care, is already set to be run in a franchise arrangement by the private firm Circle, although the deal has been delayed awaiting ministerial sign-off.
Further correspondence between McKinsey and a health department manager revealed the department had held discussions with Helios, which runs a number of hospitals. The agenda for a meeting between the consultants and the department in February next year includes the item "London/Helios discussion". The German firm has since said it is no longer interested in moving into the UK market.
A spokesman for McKinsey declined to comment.
The SNP's state guardian scheme has come under fresh attack after it emerged that children have been asked to think of their named person as the “head gardener”.
The analogy has come to light in a document created for the Children's Parliament when the controversial legislation was being considered in 2012.
During workshops with 107 youngsters aged between nine and 12, the document related how they were encouraged to imagine Scotland as a garden, with each child as a plant growing within it.
Children were told “all the adults in their lives” were “gardeners” while the named person would have overarching responsibility and be considered “Head Gardener”.
Campaigners against the legislation claimed the description of the named person as the head gardener was another sign that the scheme would diminish the role of parents.
Referring to the named person scheme, the document said: “This was a complex idea for the children (aged nine to 12) to consider but going along with our Scotland as a garden theme the children discussed the role of Gardeners (all the adults in their lives) and the job of Head Gardener (the Named Person). Children identified that all adults – family members and professional people – have and share equally a duty to make sure all children are healthy, happy and safe. The overarching requirement of a Named Person (their Head Gardener) would be that this person's key role is to keep children safe and to ensure good communication between people who are interested in the child. “
The “head gardener” concept was also referred to by the Scottish Government in its summary of children's responses to the Bill.
Simon Calvert, spokesman for No to Named Persons (NO2NP), said: “We need to know if the First Minister endorses this description of Named Persons as ‘head gardener' in the lives of Scotland's children.
“If that is Government policy then the mums and dads of more than a million children are in danger of being reduced to tattie howkers in their own homes. Is that really the legacy Nicola Sturgeon wants to leave behind? When you speak to ordinary folk about the scheme, their concerns often boil down to one central point: it undermines the role of parents.”
A SNP spokesman said: “The named person policy is aimed at protecting children's well-being. It is about supporting, not diminishing, the role of parents. The policy is widely supported by leading children's charities and welfare organisations, as well as by the Scottish Police Federation, who say it will ‘help keep children safer' – and has also been upheld by the highest court in Scotland.”
One of Showtime's signature series is mounting a comeback. The premium cable network is developing a sequel to its influential 2004 drama series The L Word, which revolved around a group of lesbians in West Hollywood and their friends, family and lovers.
Three of the original series' lead cast members, Jennifer Beals, who played Bette, Kate Moennig (Shane), who is a series regular on Showtime's Ray Donovan, and Leisha Hailey (Alice), are expected to come on as executive producers on the sequel and, if the project moves forward, they would appear on the series, with their characters serving as a bridge between the original and the new show. They would be surrounded by a new ensemble of women, with the sequel following their lives, loves and tribulations. Additionally, other characters from the 2004 series may pop up in the new version.

The original series, created by Ilene Chaiken, ran for six seasons and spawned a reality spinoff, The Real L Word. Chaiken will serve as an executive producer on the sequel but won't have hands-on involvement as she serves as executive producer/showrunner on Fox's Empire and just signed a new overall deal with the studio behind the popular Fox drama series, 20th Century Fox TV. Search is underway for a new writer/executive producer/showrunner with ties to the lesbian community to helm the followup series, aimed to reflect how members of that community's relationships, their lives, and experiences have evolved, what has changed (and what hasn't) since the show's inception.
The L Word was hailed as the first drama series to focus on lesbian characters who are complex and open about their sexuality. In 2008, Showtime did a pilot for a L Word spinoff, The Farm, set in women's prison. It was to center on Hailey's character Alice and revolve around another group of women, including several lesbians, who are behind bars. While the project, described as then-Showtime topper Bob Greenblatt as “female Oz” but not as dark, did not go to series, it was a precursor to Netflix's Orange Is the New Black, often considered a spiritual successor to The L Word.
The news of a potential L Word sequel was applauded by GLAAD. “The past few years have seen lesbian and queer women characters in television killed off in shockingly high numbers,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD President and CEO. “It is refreshing and exciting to see GLAAD Media Award-winning The L Word returning to television where it can tell nuanced, entertaining, and beautiful stories of an largely underrepresented community.”
Let's say that you're trying to play Dungeon Keeper, a game that came out in 1997. That piece of software was designed to work with a version of Windows that is seven generations old. There's no earthly reason it should play on a modern computer.
And yet there are people out there who can make it work.
Scattered across the internet, devoted fan bases secret that kind of information away. One team in Poland is constantly reaching out to these communities and soliciting their rarified knowledge, collecting and digesting their expertise so that other gamers don't have to. All in the quest to automate the process, so that older games can be played just like new ones; with a single click.
"If someone is in the community for a game that was released 15 years ago," says Magda Oracz-Chomiuk, "then that's somebody that really loves that game." As the head of product management for GoG.com, she should know. She deals with them every day.
"It's not about money for them," Oracz-Chomiuk says, "It's just about the games."
Nightmares
In a dim room of their first-floor office in Warsaw, the GoG.com QA team sits shoulder-to-shoulder playing through games that were made before some of them were out of grade school, making sure that they will run on their customer's machines.
"The PC market is so fragmented," says Ewa Stiller, pointing to a row of eight computers sitting under a desk in the corner. "So many operating systems, so many graphics cards, so many things that change in every computer. Our test lab has about 20 different configurations that we test our games on. We run it on every system a couple of times to see what happens, to make sure it's not emitting smoke or something."
The network of computers allows them to play each game, 40 to 60 times, from start to finish, using their own staff and a collection of outside contractors.
"If we're lucky the process takes about a day," Stiller says.
Sometimes they're not lucky.
"Carmageddon took three months," she says. "Everybody in QA is a bit touchy when it comes to that title. If you ask them about it, they're probably going to go gray in the face."
"We had nightmares that we wouldn't make it on time," Oracz-Chomiuk says. But in the end, it was the game's community that came to their aid.
There are even games that are still lying fallow, games they're not quite able to make work. But they're still trying.
It belongs in a museum
What GoG.com does is, in a way, a kind of archeology. Their business development team goes out and finds sites in which to dig; the intellectual property catalogs of older companies both large and small. Then, when a deal is struck, they start digging. What they find buried there the rest of their team begins to reconstruct.
Oftentimes, there's simply nothing in the ground.
"In most cases," says product manager Marcin ‘Paczyk' Paczyński, "the rights holders have absolutely nothing." That means that the team has to go scouring through the internet as well as their own personal collections to find the retail code for the games. Then their programming team puts it in a modern executable ‘wrapper' of code, and off it goes for testing.
And then back to the programmers for changes. And back to testing. And over and over until they get it right.
But along the way, sometimes interesting stories fall out. Stiller was there when they found something, hidden inside the executable file for Dungeon Keeper.
"There is a little private message written by the original programmers," she says, grinning widely. "The guy is writing a little letter on the day of the release, ‘We're really happy seeing the game, and it's a great game we've been working for 16 months on it, and it's great.'"
Jonty here: I am writing this at 4 am on Keeper's last day. I look around the office and all I see are the tired, pale faces of the Keeper team. This project has destroyed the health and social lives of each member, so i hope you like the game. Amazingly after sixteen hours a day, 7 days a week, for nearly 5 months we still do. This game has been written with a passion i am proud to be part of. … Sleep is due to me... And I have a dream to live. — Jonty Barnes, member of the Dungeon Keeper team and now Director of Production at Bungie
It's more than just games that GoG.com is keeping alive. It's the stories that surround them.
Coming to America
Guillaume Rambourg's office in Warsaw is almost entirely empty. That's because Rambourg hopes to be leaving soon to become GoG.com's Vice President of North America, a title specifically created for him to fill in the soon-to-be built U.S. office in Los Angeles.
"America is the number one territory for GoG.com," he says. "We have to be closer to them, to give them faster access to news and information."
They also need to be closer to their dig sites.
"When it comes to classic games, we are still chasing a handful of publishers. Funnily enough, all of them are based in the LA area."
But GoG.com is running out of older titles. A few, like Maniac Mansion, Rambourg calls his "holy grail." But the main reason Rambourg is coming to America is to go head-to-head against the biggest online games distributor in the world, Steam.
"One of my key missions will be to evangelize GoG.com as the number of alternative source of revenue after Steam," he says. "Our goal will be to develop that [market]."
"We wanted online features to be totally optional."
Over the last few years GoG.com has augmented their regular lineup with new games. But it's more than just highlighting the part of their catalog that features titles made after 2005. GoG.com is now in the business of day-one releases. And soon they'll offer their customers even more.
"It's called GoG Galaxy," Rambourg says. "It's a set of online features that will make the GoG.com experience better for gamers."
GoG Galaxy will allow players to receive automatic game updates, news on events and sales promotions, and multiplayer features. In short, GoG Galaxy will eventually put GoG.com on an even playing field with Valve's Steam client.
But Rambourg is quick to point out what makes their solution different — digital rights management or DRM.
"We wanted to have online features inside the online games, but we believe that those features should be totally optional. If the player doesn't want to get online to upload his achievements to his GoG account, or simply he just doesn't want to play online, he will not be requested — ever — to get online to play the single player mode. The core of the game will remain 100 percent DRM free at all times.
"There will be no such cases where you are requested to authenticate to play the single player mode, or have to stay online to play the single player mode. There will be nothing like that."
It's reminiscent of the old Interplay Entertainment slogan, "By gamers, for gamers." GoG.com is taking up that torch and carrying it back to the States.
When public health officials told Jennifer White her newborn baby had possibly been exposed to measles, she burst into tears. Griffin was just 15 days old when White took him for a routine checkup at a doctor's office in Markham in late January. On Monday, she received a call from public health and learned that Griffin had potentially been exposed.

White and her baby had shared the waiting room with someone infected with measles, or someone infected with measles had just left. Measles can be transmitted through the air up to two hours after an infected person has been somewhere. The news was agonizing for White, whose 5-year-old daughter, Olivia, died in her sleep on Boxing Day three years ago. Now, Griffin could be facing a potentially deadly illness. He is too young to be vaccinated.

Then White got angry. She wrote a powerful Facebook post on Tuesday taking aimat “anti-vaxxers” — people who do not vaccinate their children. The post, which included a photograph of Griffin, has since been shared more than 242,000 times. The viral post has made Griffin and White, a vice-president of marketing at a private school, the human faces at the centre of a debate about the importance of childhood vaccination that's been raging in Canada and the United States. White drove home the message: Vaccines are not just about your child. “We obviously have been given a huge gift with Griffin. We've opened a new chapter to our lives,” White, 37, told the Star in an exclusive interview. “I'm furious at how, as a society, we could get to this point,” she went on. “You can't just look at Griffin and say he deserves to go through this . . . We've done everything right as a family.” White, who lives in Pickering, said she's not angry at the person who possibly exposed her baby to measles, but rather at parents who refuse to vaccinate their children based on “quackery.”
“You think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren't,” she wrote. “And you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies.” She called parents' refusal to vaccinate a child against a preventable disease “unconscionable.”
Jennifer White's baby, Griffin, may have been exposed to measles from a patient in a Markham doctor's office. She is now waiting to see if he has the virus.

“I think that I really touched a nerve,” she said, adding she's been blown away by the online support. “I think that finally we're beginning to approach the point where your choice to not vaccinate does no longer outweigh my choice for my family to be safe.” Measles are highly contagious. Ten per cent of infected people experience complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis, or brain swelling. For those who know the Whites, the burden feels particularly unjust. In 2012, White went to wake up her daughter, Olivia, on Boxing Day, she found her firstborn — a sweet, princess-loving, effervescent girl — lifeless. Olivia had died of an undiagnosed blood infection. “This just brings up a whole bunch of . . . old feelings,” said White. “Your world can change in a second.” For now, Griffin is in a holding pattern — he does not have symptoms of measles but could still develop them in the coming days. White is watching for a fever, runny nose and cough. “We think every tiny sign could be something,” she said. Her ordeal comes as York Region Public Health confirmed the region's first case of measles this year on Wednesday. The infected person is under 30, male and was fully vaccinated — the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) provides over 95 per cent protection against the disease. The man visited a doctor's office in late January, but health officials won't say which one. In a joint statement also released Wednesday, Ontario's health minister and acting chief medical officer of health urged Ontarians to get vaccinated. “Parents who do not get their kids immunized are putting other children at risk,” wrote Dr. Eric Hoskins and Dr. Robin Williams.
Olivia White, 5, died of an undiagnosed blood infection, Septicemia, on Boxing Day in 2012.
For now, White remains at home, in isolation with Griffin — something she said York Region Public Health officials advised her to do until Tuesday, 21 days after possible exposure, the point at which the incubation period is over. She said she was told that if she works with children, she shouldn't go to work — but White can't avoid her 3½-year-old daughter, Aurelia. White and her husband, Glenn, initially worried about Aurelia, who has only received one dose of the recommended two-dose vaccine because of her age, but their doctor said the risk is negligible. A second dose of MMR is supposed to be administered to children somewhere between the ages of 4 and 6. Speaking to the Star, York Region Public Health said that if someone was fully vaccinated, they wouldn't be told to stay in isolation or away from work. “I can understand the mother's concern of having to wait and watch out for any kind of symptoms,” said Dr. Lilian Yuan, associate medical officer of health. “It's a difficult time for people.” Yuan said Griffin may be partially protected against the disease because he is nursing. Vaccinated mothers can pass on antibodies to their babies through breastfeeding, she said. In the meantime, White is at home, waiting. “We were hit by a truck the first time around — we didn't see it coming,” White said of Olivia's death. “This time, it's almost like you see it coming and you're stuck in the headlights. And hopefully the truck swerves. I hope to God it does.” Quotes from White's Facebook post “If you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child, I blame you.” “You have stood on the shoulders of our collective protection for too long. From that high height, we have given you the PRIVILEGE of our protection, for free. And in return, you gave me this week. A week from hell.” “You think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren't.” “And you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies because that is what I would have done, if I could, to save my daughter.” “What would you have done if your child lay dying? Would you give them a scientifically proven, safe and effective vaccine and risk the minuscule likelihood of a side effect? Or would you let them go, knowing that at least they won't develop autism (which they wouldn't even develop anyway because SCIENCE)?”

(ANTIMEDIA) Indianapolis, IN — War games and nuclear policy perpetuated by the Obama administration are “fueling growing tensions” with Russia and putting the world at risk of a nuclear war, according to an official nonpartisan organization consisting of 1,407 mayors and other leaders of cities with 30,000 or more inhabitants.
In a unanimous decision at their 84th annual conference, the United States Conference of Mayors (USCM) passed a resolution condemning President Barack Obama's decision to set the U.S. on track to spend $1 trillion over the next 30 years to “maintain and modernize its nuclear bombs and warheads, production facilities, delivery systems, and command and control.”
“The Obama administration has […] reduced the US nuclear stockpile less than any post-Cold War presidency,” the resolution, passed in Indianapolis on June 27, reads.
The resolution is supportive of the 1970 international nuclear agreement known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), but the USCM chastised the Obama administration's drift from NPT principles by contrasting it with another international agreement to which the administration has held steadfast.
Referencing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) joint-military exercise in Eastern Europe, known as Anaconda 2016, the USCM said:
“The largest NATO war games in decades, involving 14,000 US troops, and activation of US missile defenses in Eastern Europe are fueling growing tensions between nuclear-armed giants.”
Noting 94 percent of the more than 15,000 nuclear weapons in the world are held by the U.S. or Russia — and that most of those are “orders of magnitude more powerful than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs” — the USCM pushed for a nuclear weapon spending reduction “to the minimum necessary,” arguing in favor of more financial focus on “deteriorating” and “crumbling” infrastructure within the U.S., instead.
“[F]ederal funds are desperately needed in our communities to build affordable housing, create jobs with livable wages, improve public transit, and develop sustainable energy sources,” the resolution said.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were repeatedly mentioned in the USCM document, including in the opening clause, which stated asserted the 1945 atomic bombings “indiscriminately incinerated tens of thousands of ordinary people, and by the end of 1945 more than 210,000 people – mainly civilians, were dead, and the surviving hibakusha, their children and grandchildren continue to suffer from physical, psychological and sociological effects.”
Though the resolution offered praise to President Obama for his May visit to Hiroshima, as well as congratulations on the success of international negotiations with Iran over its civilian nuclear program, the UCSM resolved to demand more multilateral talks and an end to nuclear weapons manufacturing.
However, the organization does not expect change to come until at least January 20, 2017, when a new president replaces Obama. Their resolution, titled, Calling on the Next U.S. President to Pursue Diplomacy with Other Nuclear-Armed States; Participate in Negotiations for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons; Cut Nuclear Weapons Spending and Redirection Funds to Meet the Needs of Cities, issued a more urgent call for more U.S. cities to join the long-standing Mayors for Peace campaign, another movement against nuclear weapons.
Mayors for Peace is an international organization founded by the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1991. They currently have 5,500 member cities, and their goal is to reach 10,000 by 2020. The organization “calls upon cities to stand together for nuclear abolition and world peace.”
Below are the USCM's resolution's 23 sponsors and co-sponsors, all mayors, from 23 cities in 14 states, as well as the District of Columbia, according to the Western States Legal Foundation:

Image caption Judge Gregory Weeks presides over the hearing in North Carolina's Cumberland County
In North Carolina, the Racial Justice Act seeks to remedy years of inequity on death row. But can racism be regulated?
In 1991, 18-year-old Marcus Reymond Robinson and a friend convinced Erik Tornblom, 17, to give them a ride home from a gas station.
Robinson and his friend then pulled a gun on Tornblom, forced him to drive to a field, took his car and his money and shot him in the head.
A jury later convicted Robinson, who is black, of pulling the trigger on Tornblom, who was white. The prosecution presented evidence that Robinson said he wanted to kill a "whitey".
He was sentenced to death and scheduled to be executed in 2007. But like many death row convicts, he has survived past that date, and continues to appeal his sentence.
Last week, he appeared in a North Carolina courtroom as the first death row inmate to present evidence under North Carolina's Racial Justice Act (RJA), a controversial law designed to compensate for bias in the judicial system.
He and his legal team are hoping the new law will offer him relief in the form of life in prison without parole.
In the process, they're putting racism itself on trial.
'Wild disparities'
Critics of the death penalty have long argued that it is applied in an uneven and unjust fashion.
"Currently, only about 1% of the people who are accused of intentional murder are receiving the death penalty. There are wild disparities," says Malcolm Hunter, one of Robinson's lawyers and executive director of the Center for Death Penalty Litigation.
Image caption Marcus Robinson was found guilty of killing Erik Tornblom
"I could show you the summaries of 50 cases any year in North Carolina and say 'I want to pick out the two or three that get the death penalty', and you'd never be able to do it."
A series of studies over the past 30 years show that race is often a significant factor in who gets the death penalty: that black convicts are more likely to receive the death penalty than white ones, that white victims are more likely to result in a death sentence than black ones.
For Shirley Burns, the mother of Robinson, the idea of sentencing bias isn't just an academic exercise. Her other son, Curtis, was killed in 2006.
His killer wasn't eligible for the death penalty but could have served life in prison. Thanks to a plea bargain, he is currently serving a 22-year sentence.
"Punishment for a crime is not wrong, but the way that it is dealt to different people is wrong," says Ms Burns.
Though it is currently unconstitutional to seek the death penalty for racially biased reasons, defendants must prove intentional bigotry to make their case.
That's a difficult order, says Frank Baumgartner, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina.
"You would have to get someone to say I did this on purpose, and I did this for the reason of racial bigotry," he says. "It's almost never done."
But by looking at several cases over time, broader patterns of systemic bias emerge.
Excerpts from Racial Justice Act The defendant has the burden of proving that race was a significant factor in decisions to seek or impose the sentence of death in the county, the prosecutorial district, the judicial division, or the State at the time the death sentence was sought or imposed. The State may offer evidence in rebuttal of the claims or evidence of the defendant, including statistical evidence. Full text of the bill
In the 1987 Supreme Court case McClesky v Kemp, justices weighed whether these statistical patterns could be used to prove bias in a death penalty appeal.
In a 5-4 decision, the justices decided against the use of this data, noting that the matter was one "best presented to the legislative bodies" who could choose to pass specific laws addressing this concern.
In 2009, the legislature in North Carolina did just that.
Data defence
The Racial Justice Act (RJA) allows death penalty prisoners to use statistical patterns of injustice, not just the facts of an individual case, to prove bias.
A similar but weaker law exists in Kentucky, and has yet to be put to use.
Under North Carolina's RJA, Defendants are eligible for a life sentence without parole if they can show that they were more likely to receive the death penalty because of their race or the race of their victims.
They can also, as in the case of Marcus Robinson, try to prove racial bias in how the state used their "peremptory challenges" during jury selection.
These challenges allow lawyers for both the prosecution and the defence to strike a certain amount of potential jurors without cause, as long as in doing so they adhere to federal laws against discrimination.
Barbara O'Brien, a law professor from Michigan State University, studied the role of race in peremptory jury strikes in North Carolina from 1990 to 2010.

At Robinson's RJA hearing, she testified that, on average, North Carolina prosecutors in death penalty cases excluded qualified black jurors at more than twice the rate of qualified non-black jurors.
For Marcus Robinson's jury pool, qualified blacks were rejected 3.5 times more.
"Being black does predict whether or not the state will strike the potential juror, even when controlling for these other variables," she said.
The final jury seated in Robinson's case had nine white members, two black, and one Native American. The rate of black members on the jury, 18%, was not much different to that of North Carolina's black population, about 21%.
But under the RJA, the final makeup of the jury is not at issue. Instead, it's what role the state played to get to that point.
"Absent of other things, naturally the prosecution will want fewer blacks, defence will want more. The question is whether we should allow the prosecution to bleach juries," says Mr Baumgartner.
"Should the state, on our behalf, engage in a racially discriminatory pattern of behaviour?"
Colour blind justice?
For the family of Erik Tornblom questions about systemic bias and judicial fairness seem far removed from the death of their son. He is not a statistic, they say, and neither is his killer.

"What do people in Michigan have to do with us in North Carolina?" Patricia Tornblom, Erik's stepmother, asked after the first day in court. The family wore buttons that read "Justice is color blind".
To them, the only racial bias that matters should be the one that Robinson displayed when seeking out a white victim.
The prosecution cannot make this argument. They cannot provide details of the murder and argue that the death penalty was well deserved. They can only present their own statistics expert, as well as evidence from the judge and prosecutor in Robinson's original trial.
Both men maintain that race was not a factor in the state's jury selection process. More judges are expected to testify to similar effect.
But the Racial Justice Act fundamentally redefines the way the judicial system views racism. For years, the courts only saw racism as a deliberate act, done with malice.
The RJA says that racism has more to do with subtle shifts and built-in prejudices that permeate what should be a fair process.
"People can be motivated by race without even realising it," said defence attorney James Ferguson in his opening arguments. Later, he presented expert witnesses testifying to that same claim.
The hearing is expected to wrap up within the week, after which Judge Greg Weeks will make a ruling.
His decision as to whether or not Robinson qualifies for a new sentence will help shape the way that the law is interpreted in the future, and will reveal how far-reaching the consequences of the RJA could be for death row inmates, state prosecutors and the people of North Carolina.
Either way, his decision is expected to face appeals, and to serve as a historic moment in the ongoing debate over how American courts deal with race, justice and death.
Mauricio Pellegrino is "ready" for the big step up to the Saints job, according to Spain-based football journalist Andrew Gaffney.
The Argentine is on a very short shortlist of prospective replacements for Claude Puel, who was sacked last week after just one year in charge.
Former Ajax boss Frank de Boer is another man the club's hierarchy will be interviewing for the role.
Pellegrino, who was assistant manager to Rafael Benitez at Liverpool and Inter Milan, was most recently in charge of Alaves of the Spanish top-flight, leading the newly-promoted side to the Copa del Rey final and an unexpected ninth place finish.
The 45-year-old also had a difficult spell at the helm of notoriously turbulent outfit Valencia in 2012, before spells in his homeland with Estudiantes and Independiente.
Here, the Daily Echo discusses the suitability of Pellegrino for the St Mary's role with Spanish football writer Gaffney, who has covered La Liga clubs for the English press for the past four years and previously worked for Valencia.
What are Pellegrino's strengths and weaknesses?
I think the key strength with Pellegrino is his ability to learn and improve. So many ex-pros come through believing they know it all, that they have the experience and refuse to accept criticism or adapt to new surroundings. He isn't like that despite having worked under Marcelo Bielsa, Rafa Benitez and Louis Van Gaal. Not a bad trio at all. As for weaknesses, I guess it's not translating that knowledge into results for a big team. His most recent success was keeping Deportivo Alaves well away from the relegation zone and losing to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.
Is he ready to manage in the Premier League?
Is he ready? I think so. He's a huge fan of the football culture in England, having played and worked there under Benitez. He's someone who dedicates his life to the sport, is always willing to learn, and wants to have a successful career in management. In La Liga it's a rat race for most behind the top three and stability doesn't really exist. To secure one of the truly big jobs in Spain you need to either have a strong connection to the club in question or achieve something abroad.
Claude Puel's brand of football was often viewed as too cautious and even boring – what style would Pellegrino bring?
When you look at Alaves goals scored column, it doesn't look great. 41 is the lowest of the top 14 sides in Spain but instead of seeing that as a negative, it should be viewed as a positive. Fine margins win games and when your objective is survival, even more so. Alaves weren't a defensive first team but often took a few minutes to get going and were a tough nut to break down. Towards the end of the season they took their foot off the pedal as their league position was safe and attention turned to the Copa del Rey. He put a lot of emphasis on the full backs and wide players which helped on the counterattack. They had a main striker who was good in the air but willing to drop back and help out the midfield if need be. Pellegrino favoured a 4-2-3-1 formation but was happy to switch to a back five against tougher opposition. He isn't a fan of long balls though.
What is Pellegrino like as a character?
As for personality, I think he's a better fit for the Premier League than Puel due to how much he loves the game. At Alaves he was very close to his staff, from the coaches down to the kit men. He's naturally very friendly, open but not outspoken. He's also very respectful too. He won't be full of soundbites at first but if given the time to settle, hopefully his desire and passion will shine through and he'll become popular with the fans.
Would he be a good fit for a club like Saints?
For the reasons stated above, I don't see why he wouldn't fit in well at Southampton. He doesn't have an issue with playing younger players if they're good enough and Southampton have a good history of bringing through academy stars. He prefers to keep the ball on the ground, is very technical, so that too would suit Southampton. It would be a step up but one he's ready for now. He'd be able to work with better players, bring in more talent, and have a stronger squad at his disposal. He wants to reach the very top.
And, finally, what is his record like as a manager so far, could it be a risk to hire him?
His managerial record, on the face of it, doesn't look the best. However in the same regard it has only improved over time. Valencia was a mistake. He proved himself not to be ready and less so at a notoriously difficult club to manage. He returned to Argentina where he coached Estudiantes and then Independiente. At the latter he helped the club finish 3rd. Fans were sceptical at first but after six wins from his opening six games they were won over. He also beat River Plate 3-0.
Last season saw him take over at Alaves and again he set about exceeding the expectations the club had. They wanted to avoid relegation, had very little in terms of cash, but Pellegrino wanted more. He beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou and took points off everyone who finished in the European places with the exception of Real Madrid. They finished the season in 9th place and only lost in the Copa del Rey final due to a bit of magic from Lionel Messi.
A growing number of energy companies are turning to blockchain technology to solve the industry's logistical problems, such as trading errors and transmitting oil or electricity across long distances to reach consumers. Reuters reported a consortium with energy companies such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell announced plans to make a blockchain-based platform for energy commodities trading in 2018.
“Shell and BP are clearly leaders in the blockchain for energy space,” Karl Kreder, co-founder of the energy startup Grid+, told International Business Times. “In the next 12-24 months we will see a large number of proof-of-concept demonstrations in upstream energy trading.”
The consortium includes a variety of industry players such as Koch Supply & Trading, the Dutch bank ABN Amro and the Norwegian oil firm Statoil. “Ideally, it would help to eliminate any confusion over ownership of a cargo and potentially help to make managing risk more exact if there are accurate timestamps to each part of the trade,” Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC, told Reuters.
Blockchain technology is quickly becoming the supply chain management solution of choice for tech-savvy corporations who can afford new digital infrastructures. However, blockchain-enabled energy swaps aren't restricted to enterprise institutions. Cryptocurrency could help average consumers gain more control over their power sources.

The Australian startup Power Ledger raised $34 million Australian dollars in a September token sale, more than $26 million USD, and is already running pilot programs for people who want to buy or sell electricity from local solar panels. Meanwhile, a baby-faced American startup called Grid+ is launching a blockchain-based service for Texans in 2018.

Founded in April 2017, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin quickly took this project under his wing. Thanks in part to guidance from Lubin's new venture capital firm ConsenSys Ventures, Grid+ has raised more than $32 million in token sales so far. The initial token sale is still underway. It ends on Nov. 13, although regular sales will continue indefinitely.
“Texas is kind of like the gold standard with a type of market called a deregulated market,” Grid+ co-founder Alex Miller told IBT. “Retailers are perfectly competitive. The barrier to entry is very low. So that's our plan, to build a retailer in Texas.” Miller has global ambitions for Grid+, aiming to eventually license the technology out to diverse energy retailers, despite the project's niche launch.
Unlike eco-friendly Power Ledger, which offers a decentralized blockchain system for peer-to-peer solar energy swaps between neighbors, Grid+ is starting out as a pretty typical energy retailer. The customers of both startups can make money from their homes' solar panels by selling excess energy back to the main grid. Yet Grid+ is taking smaller baby steps toward a decentralized energy market. For now, the startup retailer mainly offers cheaper options and a blockchain-powered hardware device. Meanwhile, Grid+ is exploring the potential for a slightly broader pilot program with the Tokyo Electric Power Company.
Miller said he thinks it will take a decade for technology like solar panels and household batteries to become common enough for a truly decentralized energy market. “The real efficiencies of blockchain arise from instantaneous value transfer or settlement,” Kreder added. “These projects will only be successful in the long term if they adopt protocols that are generally used, or their protocol is widely adopted for general use commerce.”
That's why Grid+ is focused on customers beyond the cryptocurrency community. There's a simple process for people who want to use credit cards, instead of ether wallets, to buy BOLT tokens. “Any homeowner can sign up for Grid+, it's just a regular utility company,” Miller said. “BOLT is just basically dollars, a way of accounting for dollars on Ethereum.” The token sale is offering GRID tokens, which are a little more complex because they offer dynamic wholesale energy prices.
The Grid+ Smart Agent device will help people automatically pay their bills with a prepaid model Miller estimates could save 20 to 40 percent of a household's electricity costs. This device is a multi-purpose cryptocurrency wallet, for digital assets like bitcoin, capable of managing the household's electricity too.

“When you're putting money down it's actually being converted and sent back to your ownership,” Miller described how the prepaid cryptocurrency billing works. “If you want to cash it out, you can do that at any time because it's yours. If you want to give it to someone else, you can do that...we want this to be the kind of master IOT device in your home.”
The smart agent could eventually act like a remote control for the household, managing power and assets almost in “parallel to the legacy banking system,” he said. From internet-connected vibrators to robot vacuum cleaners, IOT household products are notoriously easy to hack. So Grid+ is using security tricks from the world of bitcoin, such as multisignature wallets that require multiple devices and password keys to align at once. Stealing the hardware wallet itself is almost pointless unless the thief also takes your brain, your phone, and possibly a trusted third party's knowledge too.
If your future high-tech refrigerator automatically orders more milk and eggs every time you run out, it would probably be easier for one secure device to manage those purchases instead of trusting the security of each new piece of furniture. “I think we are going to have increasingly more IOT devices...but those are just generally dangerous places to put money,” Miller said. “We wanted to give consumers one thing they can be sure will not be hacked...we want to build this thing to be more generalized so that other people can build other functionality into it as well.”
The future energy market could bear little resemblance to what we use today. Decentralization can make energy cheaper, by reducing transportation and administrative costs, while blockchain platforms grant consumers more independence. Enterprise consortiums with companies like BP and Shell are setting new standards for global energy industries. However, the trickle down effect will depend on how many businesses eventually work with publicly accessible networks.
With that in mind, the Austria-based blockchain startup Grid Singularity recently helped launch the nonprofit Energy Web Foundation, which uses the open source Ethereum network. “Private or permissioned blockchains are great for learning,” Kreder said. “But much like the debates over intranet vs. internet in the early 90's, it is already becoming obvious to most thought leaders in the space that blockchains will follow the same path."
We're not sure why Lucas Oil Stadium isn't allowing World Wide Wes into the arena on Friday night, or why the noted NBA power broker would even want to be in the building given the lack of obvious draft lottery talent on the floor. But we do know Lucas Oil Stadium is very serious about keeping the man out the building. Security guards have been issued pictures!

How fun! To clarify, Wes can enter the building with a ticket, he's just banned from the "special access areas." So if World Wide Wes is going to the Sweet 16 at all tonight, he's for once going to have to do it as just a normal fan.

After a two-year absence from the international stage -- during which the mainstream media dispatched them to the realm of nonexistent entities -- on October 1 the "moderate rebels" of Syria were back. The New York Times said so. Russian attacks were targeting moderates rather than ISIS, a man with a camera was quoted saying; and the Times story by Anne Barnard appeared to confirm his suspicion; even as a companion report on Russian actions in Syria by Helene Cooper, Michael R. Gordon, and Neil MacFarquhar revealed that these are the same moderates who were carefully vetted by the CIA, and concerning whom little was heard ever after. Their numbers are put at 3,000 to 5,000, though the Cooper-Gordon-MacFarquhar article leaves uncertain if that is their original or their present strength. This illumination, after so long a blackout, will doubtless be a subject for inquiry in coming days. Why it would seem worthwhile for the Russians to attack so small a force, neither of the Times stories bothered to say; nor did they explain why, if the moderate rebels are anti-Jihadist, they were allowed to garrison in the town of Talbiseh in a region north of Homs that (according to the veteran Middle East reporter Patrick Cockburn) has been "ruled" for the past two years "by Jabhat al-Nusra and associated extreme Islamist groups."
One cannot help being struck, in the Barnard story, by a disparity between the thinness of the evidence and the cocksure tone of the analysis. Consider the single piece of local testimony (generically confirmed by US sources) that is used to get us to take on trust a rebel's characterization of himself:
Among the areas hit was the base of a group that had been supported and supplied by the United States and its allies, said its leader, Jamil Saleh. He said the group's base had been hit severely in Hama Province, wounding eight of his men. Later on Wednesday, American officials confirmed that some groups supported by the United States had been hit. "We are on the front lines with Bashar Al-Assad's army," said Mr. Saleh, whose group has recently posted videos of its fighters using sophisticated American-made TOW missiles to destroy government tanks. "We are moderate Syrian rebels and have no affiliation with ISIS. ISIS is at least 100 kilometers away from where we are."
But ISIS is not the only enemy of American interests in Syria and Iraq, and it is not the only terrorist entity the US government is pledged to defeat. How close are the moderate rebels to al-Nusra? Again, the Times story does not ask.
An editorial tailwind carried the paper's fascination with the moderate rebels into a second day of coverage on October 2. A story by Barnard and MacFarquhar, "Vladimir Putin Plunges into a Caldron in Syria," speculates that Putin's entry into the war will push "independent Islamists" to ally themselves with al-Nusra, and hence presumably will take them a degree closer to ISIS. "One previously independent Islamist brigade declared its allegiance to the Nusra Front, saying unity was necessary because America and Russia were allied against Muslims 'to blur the light of truth.'" Once more, there is a nagging hint of unasked questions. What exactly is an "independent Islamist"? How close was this brigade to the "democratic values" that America espouses? Indeed, how close could it have been if the allure of al-Nusra was just a bombing attack away?
As it happens, the most damaging words ever spoken about the moderate rebels came from President Obama, in an interview with Thomas Friedman fourteen months ago. The president, displaying a candor that is intermittent with him but remarkable when it occurs, said the idea of a Syrian "moderate rebel" force was the sort of miracle cure that Americans dream up when we come to a section of the world we cannot manage:
It's always been a fantasy, this idea that we could provide some light arms, or even more sophisticated arms, to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists, and so forth, and that that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state, but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah. That was never in the cards.
The "moderate rebels" are a good deal like the Third Force once dreamed of by the architects of the Vietnam War, as an alternative to the French colonial government and the communist Viet Minh. The US found an "independent" ally in the corrupt anti-communist Ngo Dinh Diem but eventually had him deposed and killed. The upright democratic allies on the ground only existed in numbers too weak to count politically or militarily; nor could the CIA in Vietnam conjure them out of thin air; and a failure of rational doubt set the United States on the long downward spiral of that war.
The truth is that Obama when he spoke those words confessed the self-contradiction of his own policy. For his administration continues to harbor enthusiasts of the Third Force idea like Susan Rice and Samantha Power, alongside persons of a less romantic temper such as Vice President Biden and Denis McDonough. When, in August 2011, Obama said that Assad must go and implied that he must go immediately, he was commanding beyond his power to enforce, and he had nobody in view to replace Assad. The same enthusiasts had already goaded him to commit US power and prestige to the destruction of the government of Libya, without any plan for what would succeed that government. The catastrophe that followed has been so complete that for two years now the word Libya has hardly been uttered by the president; but it must be part of what he thinks of, looking back, when he considers some new piece of high strategic advice on Syria.
During his recent encounter with Vladimir Putin at the UN, Obama conceded that America could approve a "managed transition" from the Assad government to an interim government -- that is, a transition with a middle phase to smooth the exit of the detested autocrat. This would be preferable, he meant, to the direct transition from despotic rule to violent anarchy, such as occurred in both Iraq and Libya. Yet a gradual transition had been offered (so long as immediate departure by Assad was not made a precondition) during John Kerry's visit to Moscow in May 2013; and Kerry's counterpart, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, said at the time that Russia was not interested in the fate of Assad so much as that of Syria. Look at the distance between Moscow and Damascus, compare the distance between Washington and Damascus, and you can imagine why a Russian might see things that way. Russia is part of Asia; for us, an ocean intervenes. At any rate, shortly after the Kerry-Lavrov initiative all eyes were turned elsewhere by the second chemical attack and Obama's threat to bomb Syrian government forces -- a sequence of events that could not have scuttled the negotiations more neatly if it had been devised for the purpose.
Now it is 2015, and other regional powers are allied with Russia in the battle against the Islamists, but the New York Times is nostalgic for 2003. Michael Gordon has been writing some of the articles once again, and acting as a filter for the other pieces that he co-signs; and it is appropriate for readers to take him with exactly the trust that he earned by his discovery of nonexistent WMD in Iraq. An article on October 2 by Anne Barnard and Andrew E. Kramer -- the most honest of the four Times stories over the past two days -- levels with readers enough to permit a dry assessment of the Russian motives for entering the fight against ISIS and the Islamist insurgents. It speaks of the same group that the paper just five weeks earlier had called Ahrar al-Sham, under a new and more palatable name, "the Army of Conquest":
Often fighting alongside the Army of Conquest are relatively secular groups from what is left of the loose-knit Free Syrian Army, including some groups that have received United States training and advanced American-made antitank missiles. At least one group trained by the C.I.A. was among the targets hit on Wednesday, which drew an angry response from Washington.
Here, at last, one finds the beginning of a picture of the rebels in context, a picture that suggests the wildness of the American attempt to assert our will on this terrain. Barnard and Kramer continue:
But the Army of Conquest itself embodies the ambivalence of American policy. The United States considers the Nusra Front a terrorist organization, but other groups, including some that have received American funding, fight alongside the Nusra Front, saying that they have no choice if they want to unseat Mr. Assad.
The article closes with John Kerry's warning that Russia must not attack any fighting organization except ISIS. But how have we ever known exactly where ISIS is? ISIS stole a march on the US and its allies in both Iraq and Syria. Everything American authorities have said about their progress and their location has proved unreliable.
Tila Tequila offended with this photo. (Photo: Twitter)
An alt-right conference was held in Washington, D.C., on Sat., Nov. 19, and among the many gathered to hear white nationalist Richard Spencer speak was former reality TV star Tila Tequila. After she tweeted a photo of herself holding up the Nazi salute during a dinner at Maggianos Little Italy restaurant, the restaurant posted a statement on Facebook apologizing for Tequila's actions, and her Twitter account was later suspended.
"This was a last minute booking made Friday afternoon, and the reservation was made under a different name, therefore we were not aware that NPI was dining with us or what the group represents," Maggianos said in the statement. "After the event, an attendee sent a tweet in which she made a 'Sieg Heil salute' in support of Hitler and white supremacy. This expression of support of Hitler is extremely offensive to us, as our restaurant is home to Teammates and Guests of every race, religion and cultural background."
The restaurant went on to "apologize to the community of Friendship Heights for inadvertently hosting this meeting" and announced that the profits made from the night of the Tila Tequila incident will be donated to "the DC office of the Anti-Defamation League".

Introduction
Terminal Directive has just come out and with it is Ayla “Bios” Rahim, who provides a new perspective on whether to Mull or Keep.
Ayla's ability lets you draw six cards and pick four to keep in an “NVRAM” area, shuffling the other two into your deck. This changes what you're likely to draw in your opening hand, and also changes the value of your mull/keep. For example, if you have Magnum Opus in your NVRAM, you are less likely going to need it in your opening hand. In this episode of Mull or Keep, we are going to assess the NVRAM first and then work out whether to mulligan or keep the hand based on what's in it. Tricky, right?
In this episode of Mull or Keep, we are looking at the Ayla's default deck used for the Terminal Directive Campaign.. This deck is significantly weaker than you would expect from a tournament-ready deck, and will play a lot slower than you would like as a result. Similarly this also means that your mulligan doesn't have to worry too much about what the opponent's deck is capable of doing. You're likely to be running against either Seidr Laboratories or Skorpios Defense Systems, both of which are slow decks.
Ayla's Default Campaign Deck
Things to note about this deck
First weird thing… The deck is only 42 cards and is therefore an illegal deck by tournament standards. There are likely some campaign cards going in to rectify this, which does make part of the exercise I'm going through here slightly fudged.
This deck focuses heavily on the spare MU idea of the new Sage-style breaker Adept, to cover the ability to break barriers and sentries. This unfortunately does present us with a problem as we have a console that only provides +1 MU, and Magnum Opus that takes up 2 MU. The solution to this is to play Dhegdheer to free up MU, but this is an ordered install and significantly slows down your setup time. Both Dean Lister and Personal Touch add some additional bonuses to address the low breaker strength problem. We also have Datasucker to help with strength problems, and don't have to worry about Cyberdex Virus Suite in our opponent's deck, however this deck is not getting any additional value out of runs except for Datasucker, so there isn't a lot of synergy here. Each Datasucker you install also makes your Adept weaker unless you put them on a Dhegdheer. Adept is an incredibly inefficient breaker, however this is somewhat balanced around the corp deck not having as many multi-sub barriers/sentries as a competitive deck might have.
As this deck has no recursion whatsoever, Skorpios' ability is useless the entire game. That said, we still have to respect Hunter-Seeker, or a nasty Colossus faceplant, or hitting Ichi 1.0/Rototurret at an inopportune time.
In this deck, there is clearly one card that stands above all others as great to have in your opener. That card is Magnum Opus. If you can install this turn 1, then you are set for economy for the rest of the game, and you just need to find your breakers to get into other servers. To that end, some draw and some tutoring help immensely too, however your #1 priority is to find the Magnum Opus.
Some small statistics on Magnum Opus. You have a 36% chance of seeing a Magnum Opus in your NVRAM. If you don't see a Magnum Opus in your NVRAM, then you have an additional 35% chance of seeing it in your opening hand. This equals roughly a 60% chance of seeing a Magnum Opus in either your NVRAM or your opening hand. If you mulligan again you have another 35% chance again of seeing the Magnum Opus, meaning your overall chances of getting the Magnum Opus are 73%. It is worth noting that the maths on this are slightly higher than otherwise expected because this is a 42 card deck, and you should expect slightly lower chances of seeing the Magnum Opus once the campaign cards are added. Nonetheless we will go with these hands since we don't have access to the campaign cards. If our hands follow a statistical average then we should expect 6 of the 10 hands here to be keeps based on these criteria.
Even outside of Magnum Opus, it is worth thinking about which cards are valuable to keep in your NVRAM and which are not helpful there. In this deck there exist a lot of “click-efficiency” cards that are mostly there to provide a slight benefit over clicking to draw or clicking for credits. The most notable of these are Diesel and Process Automation, however Modded and Sure Gamble are arguably examples of this too. These cards are absolutely awful in your NVRAM. A Diesel is a great card to draw because it means “Oh you didn't draw what you were looking for, but your next action has a strong chance of giving you that card”. Process Automation is worse but similarly says “Oh you didn't find what you're looking for, but at least make some money next time you look”. If you have to spend a click to get these out of your NVRAM, they lose a lot of their strength. On the flip side, if you have something like Gordian Blade, Mammon, Adept, Dhegdheer, Magnum Opus or Special Order in your NVRAM, then you are getting a lot of value here. For a start you know that you never have to draw if you are looking for this specific item, saving you time as you play. Secondly, having these in NVRAM increases the chances of you seeing these other efficiency-boosting cards as you draw. Your NVRAM should therefore prioritise cards that you would be digging for, rather than cards that help you during your dig.
The Hands
Hand 1
NVRAM: Diesel, Process Automation, Datasucker, Dhegdheer, Biometric Spoofing, Dean Lister
No Magnum Opus here, which is a shame. As mentioned above, certain click-efficiency cards are a lot worse if you have to click to take them out of NVRAM (without thinning your deck in the process). This NVRAM has exactly two of these cards, so we put back Diesel and Process Automation.
Hand: Magnum Opus, Magnum Opus, Adept, Mammon, Dean Lister
Verdict: We've got the golden Mopus. Keep.
Ideal T1: It is tempting to install Dhegdheer first, as we have Adept in hand and can make use of it quickly. Get Dhegdheer from NVRAM; Install Dhegdheer; Click for a credit; Install Magnum Opus on Dhegdheer. 0C left and 4 MU free.
Alternatively: Install Magnum Opus, use three times. 6c left and 2 MU free.
Hand 2
NVRAM: Deep Data Mining, Sure Gamble, Personal Touch, Ubax, Datasucker, Magnum Opus
This is actually a pretty good NVRAM. It is filled with pieces that we want to keep. Magnum Opus being the obvious good one, but Ubax will also help fuel our draw all game if we install it early, and Deep Data Mining may be worth playing early if they leave their servers exposed. Sure Gamble isn't awful if we have to pull it from NVRAM first, but it is still a click-efficiency card so has to go back in based on the same reasoning as Diesel and Process Automation. After that it is just a question of “which of these cards is least useful in the early game” and the answer here has to be the Personal Touch. Put back Sure Gamble and Personal Touch.
Hand: Diesel, Personal Touch, Dhegdheer, Dhegdheer, Gordian Blade
Verdict: We have Diesel, and Dhegdheer to make our Magnum Opus cheap. Keep.
Ideal T1: Install Dhegdheer; Get Magnum Opus from NVRAM; Click for a credit; Install Magnum Opus on Dhegdheer. End turns with 0c and 4 MU free.
Hand 3
NVRAM: Diesel, Diesel, Special Order, Sure Gamble, Personal Touch, Dean Lister
We've made the argument about click-efficiency cards and Diesel is super important to be in your deck. Both of these are the obvious choices here. Diesel and Diesel go back.
Hand: Process Automation, Special Order, Ubax, Dhegdheer, Gordian Blade
Verdict: No Magnum Opus, so we have to make this a Mull, however this is not a great hand anyway, as Process Automation is poor draw and Ubax is expensive.
Ideal T1 (anyway) Dependant on draw: Process Automation; Draw; Get Sure Gamble from NVRAM, Sure Gamble. End turns on 11c and 6 cards. Likely discard is Special Order.
Hand 4
NVRAM: Careful Planning, Deep Data Mining, Diesel, Stimhack, Magnum Opus, Adept.
Put back: Diesel is an obvious choice for a card to send back. After that it is a bit difficult, but I'm going to say Careful Planning is the strongest contender, especially considering it is a Priority event, so you can't even “Get Careful Planning from NVRAM; Play Careful Planning” on the same turn.
Hand: Careful Planning, Modded, Special Order, Personal Touch, Dean Lister
Verdict: Modded in hand and Magnum Opus in NVRAM is very nice. We also have Adept in the NVRAM and can use Special Order to get Gordian Blade. Keep.
Ideal T1: Get Magnum Opus from NVRAM; Modded Magnum Opus; Magnum Opus for money twice. End turns on 7c and 2 MU free.
Hand 5
NVRAM: Deep Data Mining, Diesel, Modded, Special Order, Adept, Gordian Blade
Diesel and Modded are both perfect examples of click-efficiency based cards here, so have to be put back.
Hand: Diesel, Modded, Special Order, Mammon, Biometric Spoofing
Verdict: No Magnum Opus, so this is a Mull. This hand isn't super awful, as it has a Diesel that gives us a reasonable chance of seeing Magnum Opus, however we have better odds if we perform the mulligan. Worth noting that we have Mammon in hand and both other breakers in NVRAM, so the Special Order is particularly dead here.
Ideal T1: Dependant on draw: Diesel, Click for credit 3 times. End turns on 8c and 7 cards, likely discarding Biometric Spoofing and Special Order.
Hand 6
NVRAM: Diesel, Dhegdheer, Adept, Gordian Blade, Dean Lister, Dean Lister
We only have one obvious card to put back, that being Diesel, so we have to think which of these cards is least useful otherwise. Dhegdheer gives us value with our Magnum Opus, and Adept/Gordian Blade both cover our full breaker suite. Dean Lister is the obvious second choice here, and we have 2 so it is not even a big deal. Put back Diesel and Dean Lister.
Hand: Diesel, Sure Gamble, Personal Touch, Personal Touch, Ubax
Verdict: Again, no Magnum Opus, so this is a Mull, however this isn't the worst keep ever, as we have Diesel and Sure Gamble, giving us a good chance of drawing the Magnum Opus, and if we don't we have money to install Ubax we have a chance of getting it soon.
Ideal T1: Sure Gamble; Diesel; Install Ubax; Click for a credit. End turns on 5c and 5 cards in hand.
Hand 7
NVRAM: Careful Planning, Modded, Process Automation, Stimhack, Sure Gamble, Ubax
We actually have 3 click-efficiency cards here, however Sure Gamble isn't the worst to have to retrieve from NVRAM. Put back Modded and Process Automation.
Hand: Diesel, Process Automation, Special Order, Datasucker, Magnum Opus
Verdict: We have the golden card, so Keep.
Ideal T1: Install Magnum Opus; Click Magnum Opus 3 times. End turns on 6c and 2 free MU.
Hand 8
NVRAM: Deep Data Mining, Personal Touch, Ubax, Dhegdheer, Magnum Opus, Gordian Blade
This is actually a really good NVRAM, setting us up with the majority of everything we need to get through the game. Personal Touch is an obvious choice to lose here, and we want to keep both Magnum Opus and Dhegdheer. So that leaves the remaining card to put back between Ubax, Deep Data Mining and Gordian Blade. I'm going to go on a whim and choose Ubax here, but I can definitely see the argument for one of the other cards like Deep Data Mining. Put back… Personal Touch and Ubax (hard one)
Hand: Diesel, Diesel, Special Order, Personal Touch, Dean Lister
Verdict: Keep. All the draw in the world, so we can get out the Magnum Opus and later draw the other cards that we need.
Ideal T1: Get Magnum Opus from NVRAM; Install Magnum Opus; Click Magnum Opus twice. End turns on 4c and 2 free MU.
Hand 9
NVRAM: Deep Data Mining, Deep Data Mining, Process Automation, Special Order, Sure Gamble, Ubax
There are 2 click-efficiency cards here, so we choose both of those. Put back Process Automation and Sure Gamble.
Hand: Diesel, Personal Touch, Adept, Mammon, Biometric Spoofing
Verdict: Mull. No Magnum Opus, no money and while the Diesel is nice this hand is tough to use.
Ideal T1: Dependant on draw: Diesel; click for credit 3 times. End turns on 8c and 7 cards (likely discarding Biometric Spoofing and the Personal Touch).
Hand 10
NVRAM: Process Automation, Special Order, Stimhack, Personal Touch, Ubax, Adept
Personal Touch is a weak card to have early, and Process Automation is bad in NVRAM. Put back Personal Touch and Process Automation
Hand: Diesel, Diesel, Ubax, Datasucker, Dhegdheer
Verdict: There is actually a lot of draws here, so you might consider keeping this, however money will be tough too. No Magnum Opus, so this is a Mull.
Ideal T1: Dependant on draw: Diesel, Diesel, Install Dhegdheer, Install Datasucker. End turns on 2c and 7 cards (almost all of which are new draws, pretty good odds of having a Magnum Opus to install here instead).
Conclusion
In the end we had 5 mulls and 5 keeps, so we're slightly behind on our luck compared to the average. The decision whether to mull or keep here depends almost entirely on Magnum Opus, so this may seem a bit of a straightforward Mull or Keep article, however NVRAM presents interesting new problems on whether cards are more useful in your deck or NVRAM, so I hope you found some value in it.
Thanks again to @inactivist for his fine editing skills and publishing this article. Also thanks to the designers at FFG for creating Ayla, an interesting Shaper ID with a lot of thought processes. Good job guys.
In sophomore or junior year of college, I sent out a feeler Facebook status to see whom would be interested in joining a fantasy football league. This was by no means a declaration that I had created a league for other to join at my benevolent choosing. But it soon wound up that, for lack of any other voices, I was the league commissioner. No big deal. These things take care of themselves in the Internet Age. I assumed my sole responsibility was to send out invites and let the chips draft where they may.
For the love of God, don't assume this.
Even amongst college buddies, being the commish of an ESPN.com Fantasy Football League is nowhere near as powerless as it sounds. You may have seen the How I Met Your Mother episode about Marshall being the ‘Fantasy League Guy' who had to keep track of transactions by hand and assumed it was hilariously outdated; in many ways, it was not. So, before your lifelong friendships are at the razor's edge over your total inability to lead virtually, adhere to these Ten Commandments.
Rule 1: Decide where and how the money will be stored in advance.
These are my buddies I'm talking about. Why go through the complicated route of online banking, accounts, and liability? They're good for it. And it turns out they actually were. More than half of them paid me without being asked. So the money sat there in the top drawer of my dresser, most of it anyway. Pretty simple: don't touch it.
Ah, but friends, alcohol and Taco Bell are cruel sirens of the deep for a college student. And besides, it's not like I couldn't scrape together $200 on a moment's notice.
The money was whittled down to one or two entry fees by the time the league playoffs were starting. He who takes money should see to it that he himself does not become a taker.
Rule 2: Facebook/E-Mail is not the extent of your reach
I had a ‘meh'-ntality going in, so it should come as no surprise that any changes to the league were posted on facebook and that was that. If they can't join a beleaguered social network like 1/7th of the planet, they're to blame, right? Wrong. The league deserves a commissioner who will notify them before making a decision. It's much easier to take a poll than to redress angry replies.
Rule 3: Don't be ignorant of your friends' incompetence/skill when setting a schedule
Look, prejudice is a terrible thing for race, gender, all that… but a little dash would do you well for setting the schedule. Maybe you aren't sure about how a friend's team will shape up, but you know more or less who watches SportsCenter more than once a day and who seriously drafts Josh Freeman in the first round (actually happened; not naming names). Nothing is more irritating than a good team with a creampuff schedule or your team playing a powerhouse five times in a season because the commish couldn't be bothered. In general, the number of times each team plays the other should be close to even, but the number of weeks and teams throw things off. Err on the side of caution (i.e. strong vs. strong, weak vs. weak). If the league is cool with it, set the schedule after the draft based on projected strength.
Rule 4: All players are not created equal, but Week 2 is too late to fix that.
To this day, we'll probably never hear the end of how the commissioner changed the rules in his favor, and this was long after I had abdicated the throne. In fact, I suggested the rule change when I was playing the commissioner because rushing touchdowns had a godlike advantage points-wise. I clarified with the league that it was my suggestion and gave my reasoning why; he's still going to have a pall cast over him for as long as he reigns.
Rule 5: Random draft order is not good enough.
I think we're on Year 4 of this league and this is the first year a different person has had the first pick. Although the odds of that happening in a 10 team league were .001 (if my math is correct), it happened. Once again, the insatiable mob doesn't care about the truth. They care about the perception, and the perception was Reverse 1919 Black Sox. We went reverse order of wins this year, he has 6th or 7th pick. All is good for now.
Rule 6: The payout is democratic
Few things are more deflating than hearing your League Championship meant 35 percent of the pot after Best Regular Season Record, Large Second Prize, Comically Large Third Prize and Trophy Fee were paid out. Unless, you know, your commissioner promised to pay you the money and spent it all on Taco Bell and alcohol. That's probably worse. Vote on 1st, 2nd, 3rd. To Hell with regular season records.
Rule 7: Enable League Approval for trades
When it's incumbent upon the commissioner to decide whether or not his own trade is fair, your league has problems. (I was not guilty of this. I just hate this.) 4 downvotes out of 8 = trade cancelled.
Rule 8: You Neglect, You're Out
The League on FX might think every league needs a Taco who doesn't monitor his team past Week 2. Reality thinks this is a ticket to being ousted.
Rule 9: The guy someone kind of knows is the guy you kind of don't want in your league.
Continuing the comparison, that unknown person might not be a Rafi, but a fair amount of the league should know who he is. Otherwise, why not just compete against ROBOT1313?
Rule 10: Encourage humiliation.
Here's what The League nailed: comedy. Anyone can join an office league or, considering the economic state of America, a random league. Your league can be the one they spread lore about. For instance, when we were tubing down the Poudre River, my friend stole my tube and I was forced to wade across sharp and slippery rocks for a quarter-mile. I vowed revenge; he laughed it off. Well, guess whose division rival needed Michael Vick in his comeback year and guess who had Vick and Drew Brees? The revenge was colder than the water when Tube Stealer missed the playoffs.
I'm sure there are some I'm forgetting, but for the most part, leagues can be autonomous. One final rule that should apply to everyone: talking about your fantasy team to people outside the league is like talking about your son's achievements to non-parents. If we can't relate, we don't give a shit.
Having recently passed the 499th anniversary of Luther's posting of the 95 Theses to the Castle Church door in Wittenberg, there is great anticipation of the 500th celebration of this momentous event and the Reformation that it catalyzed. We typically summarize the Reformation by the five- the Scripturesteach us that sinners are saved by gracethrough faithin Christ, to the glory of God. But there was another key theme recovered by the Reformers, intimately connected to those(particularly the last one), that is forgotten and denied on a practical level even today: the priesthood of all believers.
In the 16century, the Roman church divided mankind into two groups, the "spiritual estate" and the "temporal estate." The former consisted of those involved in "full time Christian ministry," who were closest to God and salvation because of their positions in the church. The latter was the common folk, who only had access to God, His word and salvation through the clerics and the sacraments. To this way of thinking and living, the Reformers shouted "No!" In his 1520 book, To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation , Luther declared, "All Christians whatsoever really and truly belong to the religious class, and there is no difference among them except in so far as they do different work." Additionally, John Calvin stated, "In Christ we are all priests, but to offer praises and thanksgiving, in short, to offer ourselves and ours to God" (Institutes, IV.xix.28). The Second Helvetic Confession (chapter 18) affirmed this teaching as well: "To be sure, Christ's apostles call all who believe in Christ 'priests,' but not on account of an office, but because, all the faithful having been made kings and priests, we are able to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God through Christ (Exod. 19:6; I Peter 2:9; Rev. 1:6). Therefore, the priesthood and the ministry are very different from one another..."
Where did the Reformers get this teaching? From the Scriptures alone, of course. I Peter 2:4-10 is one of the clearest declarations of the priesthood of all believers in the whole Bible. Peter, writing to the church, says that we "are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood." We are "a royal priesthood." But Peter didn't make this language up; rather, he got it from the Old Testament, in particular Exodus 19. Before God forms the Aaronic priesthood, He says that the whole nation was a kingdom of priests. Out of all the nations, Israel had nearness of access to God, was set apart to serve God, to represent God to the nations, and the nations to God. Peter is taking OT language and is applying it to the church, made up primarily of the Gentile nations. The church of Jesus Christ, saved from every tribe, tongue, people and nation, is a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.
Such a status isn't because of anything in us, but only through a faith union with Jesus Christ - "As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood...This precious value, then is for you who believe..." (I Peter 2:4-5, 7). It's as we are joined to Jesus by faith alone apart from obedience to the law that we become a brick in this spiritual temple for the purpose of being a priest. The priesthood of all believers is intimately connected with that other key Reformation truth, justification by faith alone. Just as the priests in the OT were washed with clean water before putting on their priestly garments, so we have been washed in the blood of Christ and clothed in His righteousness. Peter is saying to the nations who have trusted in Jesus Christ alone for salvation, "You are connected with Israel of old; you have inherited all the promises and privileges and responsibilities that God gave to Israel! You've been called for the same purpose, redeemed by the same God, committed to the same response."
So what are the privileges and responsibilities that come with our priesthood in Jesus? First, we are called to worship and intercede. Peter is clear: as priests, we offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. We "proclaim the excellencies of Him who called us out of darkness and into His marvelous light" (I Peter 2:9). In the words of Hebrews 13:15, through Jesus we offer a sacrifice of praise to God, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name, for we remember that once we are not a people, but now we are by His mercy the people of God (I Peter 2:10). We do not need any other human intermediary but Jesus; through Him we can draw near confidently to the throne of grace. This means we do not need to go to a confessional to confess our sins. It means that we are not spectators but participants in corporate worship. And it means we intercede for one another. Like the priests of old carried the names of God's people into the holy place, like Jesus ever lives to intercede for His own, so we in Christ can pray for one another, and God hears the prayers of the saints as quickly as He hears the prayers of pastors.
Second, we are to fulfill our vocation to the glory of God. Here we're thinking about worship more broadly. That is, in whatever God calls us to do, we can and we must do it to His glory, for His sake, as unto Him. Colossians 3:23-24, "Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve." In the Reformers' day, only those who worked for the church or the monastery or convent were seen as doing God's work. But the Reformers read passages like Romans 12:1-2 and said that as priests, in view of God's mercies, all Christians are to present their bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, as their spiritual service of worship. To be sure, Jesus has instituted in His church the offices of elder and deacon; but those who hold these special offices are not special people; you don't need to be a missionary or pastor or ruling elder or deacon to serve God.
One could be a salesman, a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, an engineer, a mechanic, a computer technician, an accountant, a waitress, a grocery clerk, a carpenter, a farmer, a banker, a student - whatever our calling, if it is lawful and legitimate, it is pleasing to God, and we can and ought to glorify God in it by fulfilling the creation mandate to exercise dominion over the creation, to subdue the earth. We are to use the gifts that God has given us, to bring order out of chaos, to create value and delight for those we serve, to do our work with excellence, beauty, creativity and skill.is true not just when we think about our salvation, but when we think about our calling in creation. Just as "holy to the Lord" was inscribed on the turban of the OT priests, so "holy to the Lord" is to be written across our entire lives.
Third, missions and evangelism. In Exodus 19:4-6, as Christopher Wright has argued in his book The Mission of God, God is not declaring a condition of Israel's salvation; rather, it's a condition of Israel's mission. By keeping the covenant they would continue to be set apart from the world, and so be able to mediate the presence and blessing of the Lord as a light to the nations. As a kingdom of priests, Israel was to represent God to the nations in holy conduct, bringing God's word and glory to the nations around them; and they were to represent the nations to God, interceding on their behalf, making provision for the nations to find God through the atoning sacrifices. They were to be a vehicle of salvation for the nations; all the earth was the Lord's, but God had set Israel apart within the world the way a priest was set apart within the community.
In the same way, we who belong to Jesus are called to be a blessing to the nations; we exist for the sake of the world around us. God calls us to intercede for the nations, bringing them to God, and to bring the light of the gospel to the nations, that they might have fellowship with God through the atonement of Jesus. Our worship declares to the world that God is more satisfying and desirable than anything in this life, and we call our neighbors to repent of their idolatries and trust in Jesus alone. I Peter 2:11 tells us that as aliens and strangers in this world we are to abstain from fleshly lusts, living holy lives, consistent with our status as priests. And our holy lives will be a means by which the Gentiles around us will be converted, or without excuse on the last day (I Pet. 2:12).

The truth is, whether in our worship, our vocation, or our evangelism, we often don't do a very good job of being the priest we have already been made by Christ. This is precisely why we need Jesus as our great High Priest! With that confidence, we cry out to the Lord to enable us to cling to this doctrine as a most precious inheritance of our Reformation forbears, and use it for His glory, walking as priests in Jesus every day of our life.
The hum of the engine fills your ears and the smell of the crisp, cool air fills your body with an invigorating freshness while the sun shines down creating a color palette fit for Picasso. That's the feeling of a good road trip.
Road trips have always been a part of American history. And while going from point A to point B is the ultimate objective, it's the journey in between that provides a lifetime of memories. “Sometimes it's about the journey, not the destination,” as Ryan Eversley so eloquently puts it. Ryan would know as he just finished participating in his second Hot Rod Power Tour where he joined hundreds of fellow road trippers on a journey that began in Madison, Wisconsin and ended in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As a veteran of the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge, this wasn't Ryan's first road trip. He's spent his life on the road whether it was for a family vacation, or winding his way across North America going from race track to race track. This trip was different though. You see, Hot Rod Power Tour has forced him to find, “moments”. Moments that he had previously rushed through.
“When I was young, I just wanted to get where I was going,” he said. “Now, I'm trying to enjoy the small towns, eat at Mom-and-Pop restaurants, and see the sites when I'm on the road.” This is the essence of Hot Rod Power Tour. Six days of two-lane roads, local diners, fellow car enthusiasts, and some of the best scenery America has to offer. It's the opportunity to slow down, enjoy the moment, and create lifelong memories.
When we asked Ryan to go on the Hot Rod Power Tour, we didn't necessarily have a ride for him, so a little hitchhiking was in order. Starting out in a 525hp 2005 Pontiac GTO with model, and car enthusiast, Emily Williams, Ryan made his way from city to city. For the next five days, Ryan traded his seat in the GTO for a seat in a Lingenfelter Corvette C6.R, a seat in a Petty's Charger, and on his last day, a seat in a 1950 Lingenfelter panel van. Oh the panel van. It is a beautifully restored vehicle but as Ryan found out, not the best thing to be driving in a torrential rain storm.
While driving into Baton Rouge on the final day, Ryan found himself in bumper to bumper traffic behind the wheel of the panel van, in one of the worst rain storms he had driven. Ryan recalled thinking, “Man, we cannot afford a fender bender. It would be super embarrassing to bring Ken's (Lingefelter) car back with a caved-in bumper.” And did we mention the van has 1950's windshield wiper technology - which is minimal at best - with a sub-par defroster and no AC. As he slowly made his way across the rain soaked highway, all he could think was, “The one day we were driving the oldest car we had access to, with the least amount of creature comforts…we're driving through a tornado.” Suffice it to say, Ryan made it back safely and we're happy to report there were no bumpers lost in the process. Ryan built a story. A story that will forever be in his memory.
For many of us, the memory of a road trip takes us back to the decade where we spent our childhood. In the back of a station wagon, playing the license plate game, eating snacks, and maybe a quick sing-along (“Vacation” anyone?). One moment Ryan recalls vividly was looking out of his hotel room window in Champagne, Illinois. In a hotel where remnants of the 1970's still abound, Ryan looked out his window to greet the day and into a parking lot filled with classic cars. Red, blue, black and yellow, it was a moment that he describes by saying, “It looked like I had time traveled back to 1965 and you wouldn't experience that anywhere else other than Hot Rod Power Tour.” Another moment. Another memory. This is the heart of Hot Rod Power Tour.
Whether he was participating in the Guinness World Record for Largest Group Burnout, eating ice cream, or hitching a ride, over the course of the week Ryan found himself to be an explorer. He, “Found the good in small towns and enjoyed that ‘Americana' feeling.” So, take a cue from Ryan and take a road trip. It doesn't have to be Hot Rod Power Tour. It could be a trip to the mountains for the weekend or maybe a drive to the beach for a day. The possibilities are endless. Just remember to look around and find those moments. Moments that are sure to make a lifetime of memories. Remember, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.

Harriet Tubman
"There was one of two things I had a right to – liberty, or death.
If I could not have one I would have the other; for no man should take me alive."
It's a proven fact that you can't take one credit hour of American History anywhere in the United States without at least hearing your boring teacher drone on about something remotely connected to the Underground Railroad, yet still to this day many people don't realize how insanely balls-out this over-the-top 19th century liberation movement actually was. A clandestine network of super-secret safehouses and crazy Jack Bauer-type CTU "WHERE IS THE BOMB?!"-type shit, the Underground is well known for having transported thousands of African slaves to freedom, but the commonly-utilized, and decidedly-unbadass term "Railroad" really makes the whole thing sound a hell of a lot less dangerous and life-threatening than it actually was. We're not talking about the fucking Chunnel here, folks - this was dangerous-as-hell work deep behind enemy lines, where the slightest misstep could result in the destruction of the entire Railroad system and capture meant a lifetime of savage beatings and humiliating, backbreaking servitude. This wasn't an enterprise taken up by spineless douchebags, a fact that was never more well-illustrated than by the face-meltingly unbelievable story of Harriet Tubman. Born into slavery on a Maryland plantation, Harriet spent her first twenty-five years living under the watchful gaze of a number of different jackass overseers and housemistresses. While this five-foot tall woman may not have been the most physically imposing specimen this side of the She-Hulk exploding with 'roid rage, hard work made her tough as hell – she toned her body and her muscles working grueling manual labor twelve hours a day, seven days a week. Out in the unforgiving Maryland sun, she beat the hell out of trees with an axe, hacked up firewood, plowed an endless assortment fields, and drove unwieldy ox-carts. Before long, her physical strength matched her unshakable willpower. Despite facing a lifetime of cruel bondage, Harriet Tubman never took fucking shit from anybody ever. Her stubbornness and refusal to back down generally resulted in her suffering endless beatings and physical abuse, including one time when she was smashed in the head with a lead weight for defending a fellow slave (a wound that left her suffering dizzy spells and light-headedness for the rest of her life), but she simply refused to have her spirit broken by a bunch of jackass rednecks on a power trip. Finally, one cloudy night in 1849, Harriet Tubman had enough of it. She made a break for freedom. Fleeing into the darkness, Tubman traveled for several days through the unfamiliar Maryland wilderness, and didn't look back until she reached the friendly, we-promise-we-won't-enslave-you confines of Philadelphia.
As awesome as it was to no longer live in slavery, there was still one problem – Harriet left behind her mother, father, and nine siblings. While most people would have just shrugged and said, "fuck it dudes, you're on your own," Harriet Tubman did the unbelievable – she fucking went BACK to the plantation, tracked down her family, and led THEM to freedom. That's just how she rolled, bitches. Once Harried saw that she was capable of leading a large band of fugitive slaves safely to freedom (seriously, ten kids! Her family was almost as prolific as those crazy nutjobs in Utah who named all their kids with the letter J!) Harriet decided that she couldn't enjoy her freedom while her people remained in bondage. Using the code name "Moses", she returned to Maryland TWENTY more times, each time delivering her people from the chains of slavery to the promised land (which in this case was Niagara Falls, Canada, a 350-mile walk from the Maryland border) where they didn't have to worry about shit like getting whipped for insubordination or not having enough food to eat. Tubman rescued over 300 slaves over the course of 20 years, and was one of the greatest and most fearless heroines of antebellum America. The Underground Railroad was some serious shit. Deep behind unfriendly lines for days and weeks at a time, Tubman and her crew slept in swamps, hid during the day, and moved under the cover of darkness. Travelling with women and children, young and old, and being pursued relentlessly by police, soldiers, attack dogs, bounty hunters, and slave-catchers barely caused her to flinch. She urged her people on, led them to freedom, and threatened to fucking face-shoot anybody who suggested giving up or turning back (seriously - if one member was caught or returned, it jeopardized the entire Railroad, and she would rather have capped someone in the face than seen that shit go down). Although she was illiterate and uneducated, Harriet Tubman was by no means stupid – she cleverly hid from her would-be captors, outsmarted the entire population of Maryland nearly two dozen times, and told everybody else to get bent harder than Uri Geller's silverware collection. She made her escapes on Saturdays, which bought her a one-day head start because wanted posters could not legally be posted on Sundays – and twenty-four hours was all she needed to leave her enemies in her dust. Despite the fact that there was a $40,000 reward for the "black ghost" (a figure that today equates to a cool $4 mil), she was never caught, never defeated, and never lost a single person she escorted to freedom.
When Tubman wasn't risking her life trying to save people from bondage or biting live Piranha in half, she spoke out publicly against slavery, worked at a hotel, and helped John Brown plan and finance his attack on the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry. When the Civil War blew up like whoa, she fucking signed on as a scout with the Union Army, serving as a reconnaissance officer for Colonel James Montgomery. As a scout and spy, Tubman helped slaves escape the South, provided them with medical attention, and encouraged them to seek vengeance on their former masters by enlisting in the Federal army. She also participated in a number of military engagements, including the Raid on Combahee Ferry in 1863, when she personally helped liberate 800 slaves in a single battle. Amazingly, she wasn't even paid for her work, preferring to earn her money brewing badass root beer for the soldiers. Man, I fucking love root beer. In the 1890s Tubman had fucking brain surgery, without anesthesia She allegedly a bit down on a bullet for the pain. Is that tough enough for you? After the war she received a military pension, built a house in upstate New York, and opened up a rest/retirement home for elderly black men and women. Even into her later years she stood up for her rights, fighting for women's suffrage alongside no-bullshit chicks like Susan B. Anthony and Emily Howland. Harriet Tubman died in 1913 at the age of 93, and was buried with full military honors.
"I know of no one who has encountered more perils and hardships to save our people."

Customs And Border Protection Outlines Border Wall Requirements
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is asking for design proposals and prototypes of President Trump's proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Late Friday, the agency released specifics for the first time on how tough the barrier must be. CBP posted online two different options for contractors: one proposal must be for a solid concrete wall, another is for a wall with "a see-through component/capability" that is "operationally advantageous."
"The wall design shall be physically imposing in height," the CBP outlines say. The government says its "nominal concept" is for a 30-foot-high wall, but adds that designs as low as 18 feet "may be acceptable."
The proposal document asks contractors for 30-foot-long prototypes and mock-ups of 10 feet by 10 feet.
A CBP official told NPR's John Burnett that contractors will have to make mock-ups of their ideas in San Diego. "It's a way for the agency to identify designs. We're looking for industry's designs, to take a fresh look at the wall. We'll have industry propose and then we'll down-select."
The CBP, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, requires the wall designs to be impossible for humans to climb without a ladder. It wants proposals that will prevent people from tunneling underneath by at least 6 feet underground.
The government outlines the types of things both types of walls have to stand up to: "sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools."

It has to look good, too. "The north side of wall (i.e. U.S. facing side) shall be aesthetically pleasing in color, anti-climb texture, etc., to be consistent with general surrounding environment," the CBP says. There's no mention of the aesthetics on the Mexican side.
More than 400 companies have told the Department of Homeland Security they're interested in the project, NPR's Richard Gonzales reported last week. Cost estimates of the wall vary widely: President Trump said it would cost $12 billion; an MIT study said $38 billion.
The deadline for contractors to submit their proposals for the first phase is March 29.
NPR's John Burnett contributed to this report.
The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is holding back from launching a new tender for companies to operate detention centres at Nauru and Manus Island as security contractors shy away from future work at the camps.
The Department told The Australian Financial Review it was "progressing options to ensure services are delivered in regional processing countries" but not currently running any tenders to find new operators after Broadspectrum's contract ends in October 2017.
Finding companies willing to work at detention centres has become increasingly difficult due to ongoing protests by human rights activists.

Wilson Security, which provides guards to detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island as a subcontractor to Broadspectrum, said on Thursday it would not re-tender for work when its contract finished because the work no longer fitted its "strategic priorities".
The security group is part of the privately controlled Wilson Group, which owns parking and storage businesses as well as healthcare group Medic One.
And so the Melbourne Victory juggernaut keeps rolling along. Impervious. Imperious. As we head towards the climax of a season that will leave more questions than answers, the Victory have once again comfortably drawn the biggest crowds (average 25,626), and will end up making the most money. Excellence brings its own rewards.
Sydney FC may be making some encouraging moves, but it's the Victory who continue to set the benchmark. They're a bigger business, and a better business, than some AFL clubs in town. With a market value of around $30 million, the Victory are proof that if the right people make the right decisions at the right time, running an A-League club can be made to work. In the wake of the salary cap scandal that has engulfed Perth Glory, the contrast could hardly be more pronounced.

It may be that the Victory, with perhaps some help from the Sky Blues, will end up putting an exclamation mark on a season that has tapered off dramatically since the Asian Cup. A grand final at ANZ Stadium between the two traditional heavyweights would certainly lighten the mood of those who fret about the A-League's viability, although the four other finalists would undoubtedly disagree.
The top six, of course, has now been decided thanks to Football Federation Australia's heavy sanctions on the Glory, but the minor premiership hasn't. The Victory are in pole position with a game in hand over the Sky Blues and a vastly superior goal difference, and few would begrudge them a third Premier's Plate.
The pardon was approved by the late prime minister Meles Zenawi before his death last month and comes days after Sweden's foreign minister attended his funeral in Addis Ababa.
"Yes they are already released," said Dina Mufti, a spokesman for the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to AFP on Monday afternoon.
He was unable to elaborate on their current whereabouts, however.
Justice Minister Berhan Hailu said the two journalists were expected to fly out of Ethiopia within a day.
"The decision was made on the 12th of July," when Meles was still alive, he told reporters. "According to the constitution, they have to leave the country within 24 hours."
The two jailed Swedes, reporter Martin Schibbye and photographer Johan Persson, were jailed for "supporting terrorism" on July 1st, 2011 together with rebels from the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) after illegally entering from Somalia.
Each was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
Ethiopia's justice minister Hailu, confirmed that Swedes were among over 1,950 prisoners who had been pardoned, a group set to be released in a ceremony on Tuesday, wrote the Dagens Nyheter newspaper.
The minister added in a statement that the Swedes had “shown true regret for their crimes and behaved well in prison” according to DN.
At the weekend, Sveriges Television (SVT) reported that Ethiopia traditionally pardons prisoners in connection with the Ethiopian new year, which this year falls on Tuesday, September 11th.
Swedish Foreign Affairs Minister Carl Bildt was one of the few Western ministers who attended the funeral in Addis Ababa of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on September 2nd.
His presence at the funeral fuelled speculation that the Ethiopian authorities, under intense international pressure over the detention of the Swedish journalists, could take advantage of the New Year pardons to free them.
Schibbye's mother expressed her relief at the news of her son's release.
"Right now I'm just very, very happy, and oh how we've waited for this day," Karin Schibbye told Swedish news agency TT.
The pardon sparked no immediate reaction from the government but the Swedish Union of Journalists hailed the decision to release the pair.
"I am so very glad that Martin (Schibbye) and Johan (Persson) have been freed after 14 months in an Ethiopian prison. I hope they can be reunited with their families as soon as possible," union chief Jonas Nordling said in a statement.
"We hope they will be home on Swedish ground soon," Lotta Schuellerqvist, of the Swedish branch of French-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders, said in the same statement.
The case had drawn heavy criticism from rights groups. The journalists were convicted under Ethiopia's anti-terror law, which critics have called vague and indiscriminate.
The freelance journalists were in the remote southeastern region of Ogaden, populated mainly by ethnic Somalis, to investigate the activities of a company affiliated with the Swedish oil firm Lundin Petroleum.
Press watchdog Committee to Protect Journalists has said Ethiopia has one of the most restricted media in the world, with 79 journalists forced into exile since 2001.
It was not immediately clear whether Ethiopian journalists who were also detained under the anti-terror law would be released as part of the wave of presidential pardons, which officials expect to affect around 2,000 people.
"Despite this development, other journalists remain in prison and we hope that Ethiopia will release them as soon as possible," IPI Deputy Director Anthony Mills said in a statement.

Since Donald Trump's election win in 2016, his supporters and the political right in general have repeatedly been targeted for violence and intimidation.
News broke Monday that anti-white hate crimes grew faster than any other racial hate crime category in America in 2016. According to statistics released Monday, there was a 19.34 percent increase in anti-white hate crime attacks from 2015 to 2016. (RELATED: FBI: Anti-White Hate Crimes Are The Fastest Growing Racial Hate Crimes In America)
Indeed, many anti-Trump attacks have had a racial component to them.
In January 2017, a shocking video emerged from Chicago, when a young mentally disabled white male was kidnapped by a group of black assailants. The victim was tied up, tortured, sliced with a knife, and forced to drink toilet water while they yelled, “Fuck Donald Trump!” and “Fuck white people!”
Chicago man David Wilcox was also brutally beaten in November 2016 while onlookers screamed, “Don't vote Trump!” and “Damn, he voted Trump!”
According to a later interview with the victim, the crime had a racial component. According to Wilcox, the attackers, all black, attacked the man after saying “Yeah that's one of those white boy Trump supporters.”
Wilcox did in fact vote for Trump, but he said the attackers would have no way of knowing that. He was simply attacking him for being perceived as a Trump voter due to his race. (RELATED: Man Robbed And Beaten By Trump Haters Speaks Out)
CNN commentator Symone Sanders responded to this beating by sarcastically sneering, “Oh, my goodness, poor white people!”
Meanwhile, attacks against all conservatives and Republican politicians have seen a worrying rise.
Recently, Republican Sen. Rand Paul was attacked at his home by a neighbor. A motive for the attack is not currently known, but prosecutors are now looking at bringing federal charges against the attacker, a sign the attack could have been political. (RELATED: REPORT: Federal Charges Expected For Rand Paul's Attacker, Assault May Have Been Politically Motivated)
According to other neighbors, the attacker was known for being an avowed socialist and engaging others in political arguments.
A gruesome example of anti-Republican violence occurred in June, when a baseball practice of GOP congressmen was shot up by James Hodgkinson, an anti-Trump Bernie Sanders fan. (RELATED: Man Who Opened Fire On GOP Lawmakers Is A Bernie Sanders Supporter, Called Trump A ‘Traitor')
Hodgkinson, who called Trump a “traitor” and Republicans the “Taliban of the USA,” critically wounded Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. He also shot several others at the baseball field, injuring five.
After local Republicans were threatened, in April in Portland, Ore., a parade was canceled.
And in June in Indiana, a black male suspect shot at a man driving a truck with a “Make America Great Again” flag on a highway.
Incidents of violence from “antifascist” Antifa have broken into the mainstream political discussion, with President Trump even calling them out by name in August.
On Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C., Antifa and took to the streets and rioted in a “Black Bloc,” breaking windows, violently attacking Trump supporters, and setting a limousine on fire. The riot lead to over 200 arrests.
On the same day, an anti-Trump protester tried lighting a Trump supporting girl's hair on fire. A Trump fan was also punched in the head and violently attacked on Inauguration Day for putting out a fire.
Outside of planned protests, has also repeatedly attacked right-wingers in various incidents.
At an airport protest in January in Portland, Oregon, a Trump supporter was violently attacked and knocked out by anti-Trump protesters. In May, a former professor was arrested for brutally bludgeoning a young Trump supporter in the head with a bike lock as part of an Antifa mob. In late August, Antifa again violently targeted a peaceful right-wing protest.
Antifa violence also shut down a planned talk at University of California – Berkeley by former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos. (RELATED: ‘INFERNO' — Milo Speech Cancelled After Rioters Set Campus Ablaze [VIDEO])
Rioters beat would-be attendees of the speech, pepper sprayed innocent women, and beat a man unconscious.

Fears of Antifa violence also prevented conservative author Ann Coulter from speaking at UC Berkeley in April.
Post-election violence in November 2016 also prominently took place in schools.
An elementary school student in Stafford, Texas was badly beaten up by his classmates for voting for Donald Trump in a school's mock election. (RELATED: 11-Year-Old Boy Badly Beat Up For Voting Trump in Mock Election)
In another incident, a high school student in Rockville, Maryland was attacked for wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. In Redwood City, Calif., a female high school student was brutally beaten for supporting Trump because her classmates thought it meant she hated Mexicans.
Another high school student punched a classmate for holding a Trump sign. When he was taken to the office for his attack, he reportedly threatened, “When I see that white boy again, I'm going to punch him in his face.” And in Meriden, Conn., a man holding a Trump sign after the election was attacked on a traffic island by two men. At Rutgers University, a man wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat was attacked by a man in a Black Panthers cap.
There are countless other examples of individual Trump supporters being violently targeted.
Left-wing violence in America has a long and storied past, and conservatives aren't the only ones worried about rising political violence from the left. Following the shooting of Steve Scalise, NPR ran a segment asking, “FACT CHECK: Is Left-Wing Violence Rising?,” concluding that a full-on trend towards violence isn't necessarily afoot, but that “[d]omestic terrorism experts say that concern is only heightened by the fact that the line between what's considered mainstream and what's considered fringe is becoming increasingly blurred.”
Vanity Fair also asked, “Is The Left Also To Blame For Political Violence?” in the wake of the GOP baseball shooting.
The mainstream news media hasn't done much to quell the rising tide of anti-conservative violence, and in many cases, has fanned the flames of tension.
CNN in particular has whitewashed Antifa violence, especially after the August clashes between white nationalist protesters and Antifa in Charlottesville, Va.
Don Lemon stated that although the tactics of the violent Antifa “weren't exactly right,” they were simply “protesting hate in America.” (RELATED: Watch Don Lemon Whitewash Antifa In 90 Seconds [VIDEO])
Meanwhile, CNN host Kamau Bell actually spoke at an Antifa rally to say, “when the Nazis leave, as they have left…you have to stand up for the brown people, the black people, the LGBT people, the immigrants–everybody everyday!” (RELATED: CNN Host W. Kamau Bell Spoke At Antifa Rally [VIDEO])
Sara Sidner, a CNN correspondent, also defended Antifa violence, saying, “their idea is, ‘look, non-violence hasn't worked, we are going to try to stop this.'”
CNN.com reported on Antifa by saying that the groups “[seek] peace through violence.”
NBC News ran an article recently that questioned whether Antifa violence was actually “ethical.” MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace also said that violent Antifa were “good people” on “the side of angels.”
Reuters also referred to anti-Trump protesters, a group which has often been violent as “peace activists.”
Jonathan Capeheart, a writer with The Washington Post appeared on MSNBC to proclaim “Antifa is not the issue.” (RELATED: WaPo Journalist On MSNBC: ‘Antifa Is Not The Issue' [VIDEO])

A growing number of engineers and tech workers from the San Francisco Bay Area are looking to leave Silicon Valley for burgeoning tech hubs such as Austin, Texas, and Seattle, Washington, according to a job-search site's data.
Indeed.com found that the share of searches from within the Bay Area for tech jobs outside of it is on the rise. As of Feb. 1, 35% of tech job searches on Indeed.com from the region were for jobs elsewhere, data from the company shows. That share, which is based on 30-day averages and adjusted for seasonal factors, was up about 30% year-over-year.
The portion of searches for work outside of the Bay Area—which has the most expensive rents in the US—was also highest among people ages 31 to 40, suggesting that people are leaving to find better opportunities elsewhere or to settle down in more affordable areas where they can improve their quality of life.
“In the Bay Area, there's been such enormous growth and opportunity that it's created some challenges for happiness,” Paul D'Arcy, senior vice president at Indeed.com, told Quartz. “Job searchers are always balancing opportunity and happiness. As people think about what the right fit for them is, housing, traffic, and quality of life are really important factors.”
This trend doesn't diminish Silicon Valley as a tech hub, D'Arcy said—66% of tech job searches were still for work within the Bay Area, and people from other parts of the country are migrating to the region every day. Rather, it speaks to the growth of technology opportunities around the US.
The most-searched places outside of California were major cities—New York, for example—and more affordable places with growing tech communities, including Austin and Seattle.
Most-searched cities for tech jobs from people in the San Francisco Bay Area
Rank City State 1 New York 2 Austin Texas 3 Seattle Washington 4 Atlanta Georgia 5 Houston Texas 6 Chicago Illinois 7 Dallas Texas 8 Portland Oregon
“It's amazing to see other places that are small up very high,” D'Arcy said. “That reflects other strong tech centers that are perceived as having a higher quality of life.”
D'Arcy said this type of migration—from big to smaller cities—is common around the world. The same patterns can be found in the UK and Germany, for example, with people moving from London to Cambridge and Berlin to Munich.
And where the talent goes, companies follow. We're seeing this already with tech giants like Facebook opening offices in Austin and Seattle, and Google leasing space in downtown Portland.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – Donald Trump's promise to gut U.S. environmental regulations and revive the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline if elected president is a nightmare for green groups, but it may be a dream come true for their fund-raisers.
The country's biggest environmental groups say the Republican White House hopeful's pro-drilling and anti-global warming positions have sparked a record wave of donations and volunteer recruitment that could revitalize U.S. green advocacy.
Trump has said he would revive the coal industry, pull the United States out of a global climate pact and expand oil drilling.
“We couldn't have asked for a more powerful motivator than Donald Trump,” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said.
Brune said a spring email blast about the New York businessman to the San Francisco-based group's members yielded $25,000 in donations, more than twice as much as projected, along with 15,000 new volunteers.
The club's Political Committee, which works directly on projects to engage voters during the election, has raised more than $62,000 this year, compared with just $22,000 at this point in the 2012 election, according to the filings with the Federal Election Commission.
The Washington-based League of Conservation Voters has also gotten a boost. Officials said its annual fund-raising dinner this week pulled in a record haul, which they would not disclose, after the group also used Trump as a focal point of its donor outreach.
“It's been a long time since there has been someone that our movement has so universally wanted to stop,” said spokesman David Willett.
The league's Voters Action Fund, meanwhile, has raised more than $610,000 in donations so far this year for election-related work, more than triple what it pulled in during the same period of 2012, and more than double that of 2008, according to federal filings.
Trump has long signaled his belief that global warming is a hoax. Last month he outlined plans to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by the Obama administration, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL – moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement.
A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NextGen Climate, a San Francisco-based environmental advocacy organization founded by billionaire activist Tom Steyer, has called Trump's agenda “frightening.” But its efforts were also getting some traction from the candidate's rhetoric.
The group, which has featured Trump in its TV ads to drive voter turnout, said it had seen a 127 percent increase in clicks on its social media postings that mention the candidate compared with those that do not.
“There is no question that voters are very engaged when it comes to fighting back against Trump,” said NextGen spokeswoman Suzanne Henkels.
Ben Avery, associate fund-raising director of the Sierra Club's Northwest chapter, said he was happy about the increase in donor support this year but was vexed by the reason behind it.
“Bad news is good news for fund-raising,” he said.

Zach Braff – Facebook Proved I was alive
So Zach Braff, star of Scrubs was on Conan last night. I am not a Scrubs fan, or really much of a Zach Braff fan, but he dropped a gem last night. Conan and Braff were talking about the fake death rumors that were circulating the internet about Braff earlier this year. Conan asked him how you clear up something like that? Braff responded with:
I went on Facebook…You know… You can quickly be like, hey I'm alive!
This was hilarious. He then went on to talk about how he and Co-Stars of scrubs had a little fun with proving his vitality on the internet.
Comedy aside, Braff is absolutely right. Facebook is a great medium to communicate with fans and the “real world”. Whether it's interacting with fans, or proving that you haven't committed suicide, Facebook and social media in general is a tool that all stars should adapt to connect with their fans.
So, well-played Zach, happy to still have you here.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Exhausted engineers attached a power cable to the outside of Japan's tsunami-crippled nuclear plant on Saturday in a race to prevent deadly radiation from an accident now rated at least as bad as America's Three Mile Island incident in 1979.

Further cabling inside was under way before an attempt to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods at the six-reactor Fukushima plant in northeastern Japan, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.
Japan's unprecedented multiple crisis of earthquake, tsunami and radiation leak has unsettled world financial markets, prompted international reassessment of nuclear safety and given the Asian nation its sternest test since World War Two.
It has also stirred unhappy memories of Japan's past nuclear nightmare — the U.S. atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
Working inside a 20 km (12 miles) evacuation zone at Fukushima, nearly 300 engineers were focused on trying to find a solution by restoring power to pumps in four of the reactors.
“TEPCO has connected the external transmission line with the receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can be supplied,” the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said in a statement.
Another 1,480 meters (5,000 feet) of cable are being laid inside the complex before engineers try to crank up the coolers at reactor No.2, followed by numbers 1, 3 and 4 this weekend, company officials said.
If that works it will be a turning point.
“If they are successful in getting the cooling infrastructure up and running, that will be a significant step forward in establishing stability,” said Eric Moore, a nuclear power expert at U.S.-based FocalPoint Consulting Group.
If not, there is an option of last resort under consideration to bury the sprawling 40-year-old plant in sand and concrete to prevent a catastrophic radiation release.
That method was used to seal huge leakages from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
Underlining authorities' desperation, fire trucks sprayed water overnight in a crude tactic to cool reactor No.3, considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides, or mox, containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium.
Japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level INES international scale, putting it on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although some experts say it is more serious.
Chernobyl, in Ukraine, was a 7 on that scale.
THOUSANDS DEAD, MISSING AND SUFFERING
The operation to avert large-scale radiation has overshadowed the humanitarian aftermath of the 9.0-magnitude quake and 10-meter (33-foot) tsunami that struck on March 11.
Nearly 7,000 people have been confirmed killed in the double natural disaster, which turned whole towns into waterlogged and debris-shrouded wastelands.
Another 10,700 people are missing with many feared dead.
Some 390,000 people, including many among Japan's aging population, are homeless and battling near-freezing temperatures in shelters in northeastern coastal areas.
Food, water, medicine and heating fuel are in short supply.
“Everything is gone, including money,” said Tsukasa Sato, a 74-year-old barber with a heart condition, as he warmed his hands in front of a stove at a shelter for the homeless.
Health officials and the U.N. atomic watchdog have said radiation levels in the capital Tokyo were not harmful. But the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material.
“I'm leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,” said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at Narita international airport using his laptop.
“I'll probably come back in about a month.”
Though there has been alarm around the world, experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations.
The U.S. government said “minuscule” amounts of radiation were detected in California consistent with a release from Japan's damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern.
Amid their distress, Japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape.
“My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing,” Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters.
G7 INTERVENTION FOR YEN
The Group of Seven rich nations succeeded in calming global financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen.
The dollar surged to 81.98 yen on Friday after the G7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars, euros and pounds — the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000.
The dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen, but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday.
“The only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention, and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan,” said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
Japan's Nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent, recouping some of the week's stinging losses. It lost 10.2 percent for the week, wiping $350 billion off market capitalization.
The plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas.
Nearly 290,000 households in the north were still without electricity, officials said, and the government said about 940,000 households lacked running water.

Aid groups say most victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering.
“We've seen children suffering with the cold, and lacking really basic items like food and clean water,” Stephen McDonald of Save the Children said in a statement on Friday.

What is the BLEduino?
The BLEduino is a tiny Arduino-Compatible development board with Bluetooth 4.0, a.k.a. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), built in. The BLEduino is both hardware and software compatible with Arduino since it's based on the Arduino Leonardo. Anything that runs on an Arduino will run on a BLEduino. It's the easiest way to get Bluetooth 4.0 in your project! Control anything from your phone!
Full Arduino Shield Compatibility
We wanted the BLEduino to be small enough to be used in any project, but not if that meant you'd lose the ability to use all your awesome Arduino shields. For this reason, we created the Shield-Shield. The Shield-Shield is a handy attachment that translates the BLEduino's pin layout into the traditional Arduino layout. That is, it makes the BLEduino fully Arduino shield compatible. Note, we've noticed a trend of boards stating they are compatible with all Arduino Shields when they actually aren't. For a board to be fully compatible you would need it to support both the old Arduino UNO pin layout and the new Arduino Leonardo pin layout. Not only that, the boards would have to support 5V logic (which we do). The layout problem is solved by our Shield-Shield by allowing you to switch between the old and new pin layout by just flipping a switch. In other words, the same Shield-Shield is basically backwards and forwards compatible, allowing it to work with nearly all Arduino shields. C'mon, you know that's pretty awesome.
Modular and Compact
The BLEduino is great for prototyping! It's breadboard compatible, tiny enough to fit in any enclosure, and compatible with standard shields when you need it to be.
Ease of Use
The BLEduino works for everyone. Not an expert in iPhone or Arduino development? No problem! Simply use our free iPhone application and/or our pre-made Arduino sketches (that use our included BLE arduino library) and you're good to go! Our iPhone app is also fully open source and broken up into modules so you're free to take what you need and ignore the rest if you want to develop your own app. There is no limit to what you can create and we're super excited to see what you build with it.
Android Support
Sadly, Android does not have official support for Bluetooth 4.0. However, it is our top priority to provide the BLEduino app to Android phones once support is established. It's been announced that the next version of Android will include support so you can expect the app shortly after the SDK gets released. Rest assured, support is coming.
Open Source
Open source goodness. The BLEduino is 100% open source in every way. The iPhone app, the schematics / pcbs, and all the firmware will be released to the community once we're done with the development.
Why did we create the BLEduino?
We love creating smart and connected devices. While tinkering away one day, we realized that getting Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) to work with existing projects wasn't exactly lollipops and sunshine. So we decided to abstract all that nasty low level stuff, make a simple-to-use iPhone app, and bundle it all up in an Arduino-compatible board that the world could use.
What can I do with the BLEduino?
All sorts of things! That's the beauty of it! In particular, since it's based on the Arduino Leonardo you can do keyboard and mouse emulation, a feature that's uncommon on other boards. Here are a few examples of things you can do with the BLEduino (all of these are live in our video):
Here are a few unique ones to BLEduino:
These are just a few of the awesome things you can build with the BLEduino. Also, BLEduinos can communicate with each other via a hub (your phone or computer) enabling even more complex scenarios. Helicopter army anyone?

Where we're at
The BLEduino has currently evolved over two designs and is expecting one last design. We started out using a third party BLE module but quickly moved on to our second design, which includes our own BLE module, a change that lowered the cost dramatically. Our third and final version will be smaller, sexier, and much more polished!
The Shield-Shield has also gone through some evolving with one last design in the production. The final version will allow you to switch the Shield-Shield between old and new pin layout. (More info in the FAQ)
We want our iOS application to be a living example of what easy Bluetooth integration should be. For this reason we are taking extra care in making sure our app is optimized and easy to understand, that means there is still work to be done. We are always adding things to the BLEduino so you can expect to see some additional modes and features.

The Team
We're a team of engineers, designers, and doers who build things that incorporate hardware, software, or both. We created the BLEduino because we wanted to simplify Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) development and enable easy communication with smartphones. Our team:
Jonathan. Pixel lover & leader of the pack. Co-founder, designer, and CEO. Loves to talk about the pixels and the "essence" of things. Completely obsessed with the BLEduino and is occasionally caught staring at it for long periods of time.
Ramon. iOS terminator & back-end conquistador. Co-founder, developer, and customer development evangelist. Kickstarter junkie. Loves to talk about startups, tech, and everything in between.
Angel. Hardware extraordinaire & human SMD machine. Co-founder, hardware engineer, and front-end developer. Loves to talk about how insanely tiny our components are and how he hand soldered that one component you can barely see.
Thank you!
We hope you're as excited about the BLEduino as we are and can't wait to get easy Bluetooth 4.0 to everyone in the world!
Also, we'd like to give a special thanks to EngiWorks, the awesome folk that have been giving us office space since our inception.

STILWELL, Okla. (WOMENSENEWS)– For six years Brendan Johnson served as U.S. attorney for the State of South Dakota.
During his time as federal prosecutor, Johnson says fully 100 percent of the women and girls engaged in the sex trafficking industry were victims of rape and-or sexual abuse earlier in their lives.
"We had an underage girl from the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota who was picked up in Sioux Falls and wound up in a sex ring," said Johnson, who is now in private practice, in a phone interview from his office in Sioux Falls, S.D. "She was a single mother and had not a penny to her name, which is very common. She didn't want to rely on government assistance because of the fear that her child would be taken away. She had also been sexually abused prior to this. So the high economic impact of these situations is hard to accurately quantify, because of post-traumatic stress disorder and the related issues for girls who are vulnerable targets for these criminals."
Tribal women are at the most vulnerable group of women when it comes to rape; nearly three times as likely to suffer sexual assault than all other races in the United States, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice.
"It happens every day in every native community–it's that common," says Jodi Gillette, the former special assistant on Native American Affairs to the White House. "I know literally dozens of women who have told me at one point or another that they were raped or sexually abused, but no one talks about it because of the stigma. So they suffer in silence."
Gillette, who now serves as a tribal policy advisor for the Sonosky Chambers law firm in Washington, D.C., recently testified at the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva that even with recent passage of the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and the Violence Against Women Act of 2013, which closed jurisdictional gaps and allowed non-tribal perpetrators to be tried in tribal courts, much work remains to be done.
Basic Services a Struggle
"Many tribes struggle to provide basic victims services, necessary training and staff for courts and adequate mental health care," said Gillette in a recent phone interview. "To this day, tribes still cannot prosecute non-Indians for child abuse, rape and other serious crimes against women and children and must rely on the federal authorities, who usually only prosecute the worst crimes. This leaves vulnerable many Indigenous women and children unprotected in their own homelands."
Nearly one-third of tribal women, or approximately 875,000 nationwide, report being raped at some time in their lives. Two-thirds of their perpetrators are non-Indian, who until very recently could not be prosecuted in tribal court and are still unlikely to ever face formal charges for their crimes in state or federal court. This is due, in part, to the fact that–despite the recent expansions of tribal court to prosecute rape–many smaller and-or remote tribes either do not have their own tribal court systems and do not have the resources to establish one.
The scourge of rape in Indian country has impacted every single community among the nation's 567 federally-recognized tribes, whose total population hovers around 5.2 million
The costs–both emotional and financial–are staggering for communities already beset by poverty and its attendant social problems in geographically isolated regions.
The American College of Emergency Physicians, based in Irving, Texas, estimates that the tangible costs of rape–for both the victim and the society–are approximately $150,000 per victim. That amount covers a range of categories including expenses for justice and prosecution, physical and mental health issues for the woman and her family, social services including emergency response teams and shelters, loss of education, loss of wages and/or employment.
Emotional costs, including pain and suffering for the victim and her children, possible death of the victim, including suicide and others, are incalculable.
Native American writer Louise Erdrich, in her 2012 book "The Round House," tells the story of Geraldine Coutts, an Ojibwe woman who has been raped on Indian land. After her attacker goes free because of jurisdictional issues on Indian reservations, her teenaged son sets out on a quest to seek justice for his mother, who has retreated to her bed, paralyzed by grief and trauma.
Though the story is fictional, Erdrich's book accurately captures the terrible toll of rape for Native women
Tribal leaders estimate that the final tally is in the billions for native communities already strapped by poverty and lack of opportunity.
Overlapping Issues
The pervasive and pernicious nature of sexual assault and abuse overlaps with a variety of other serious issues within native communities.
"Sexual assault presents some of the greatest challenges in Indian country," Kevin Washburn, assistant secretary for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, said in a recent email interview. "Because of the devastating impact that sexual assault can have on self-worth and self-esteem, we know that it may be a contributing factor to the epidemic of youth suicides. As we try to help tribal communities cope with a suicide crisis, it is imperative that we address each of the risk factors. For that reason, we have been working on better responding to the needs of survivors of sexual assault."
Across the country, geographic isolation and jurisdictional complexities continue to be the biggest obstacles in both the prosecution and restitution of these crimes, particularly in Alaska, which has 229 tribes and is nearly three times larger than Texas.
The Northern Plains and the tribes of the Southwest are similarly situated, with tribal law enforcement and social service departments already bursting with overflowing caseloads and limited resources to prosecute. But with a growing sense of urgency, many tribes are redirecting as many resources as possible to address what is regarded as a human rights crisis in Indian communities.
The two largest tribes–the Cherokee Nation and Navajo Nation, for example–have dedicated agencies to assist their tribal members who are victims of sexual assault and other violent crimes. In 2013, the Cherokee Nation opened the One Fire Victims Service Office, which provides emergency advocate assistance to law enforcement, transitional housing and even legal assistance for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking or dating violence.
Help To navigate the System
The Navajo Nation Victims Assistance Program also works closely with the three states within its boundaries–Arizona, New Mexico and Utah–to assist its tribal members with help in navigating the legal system, as well as completing applications for financial assistance for health-related expenses, costs of funerals, lost wages, eyewear, and Native healing ceremonies and traditional medicine people.
The smaller tribes, many of whom have poor economies and high unemployment, still struggle with the enormous legal, logistic and financial burdens of sexual assault in their communities.
For them, not much has changed over the years, in spite of new legislation and programs to help stem the violence against Native women.
Gillette recalls a high school friend from the 1980s whose case is one of the few that have ever gone to trial. She says her friend, who was from the Northern Plains, was skewered and portrayed as a "whore" on the stand after being gang-raped by a half-dozen white teenagers from a neighboring community, even though she was a virgin at the time of the assault. Nonetheless, her perpetrators went free while her friend felt punished for coming forward.
"They made an example of her," said Gillette, who remains haunted by her friend's case. "The message was clear, ‘This is what's going to happen to you if you tell.' And she was only 15 years old. In this day and age, you'd think we're past that–but we're not."
Bullying, abuse and harassment of LGBTIQ* students in educational institutions takes many forms. For Tushar, 21, a student at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, it was an anonymous blackmailer, who tried to extort a substantial sum of money (Rs. 5000) from him by threatening to out him on campus as gay.
At first, Tushar thought that the note slipped under his hostel room door on Oct 11, 2015, was some sort of prank by a fellow student. The next one read: “I am not joking… this is important for both of us as I need the money and your secret won't get out. If your secret is leaked you will be hated by everyone and your career will be ruined in IISc”.
The notes kept coming. Nine in all, over the course of five days.
And they got nastier. On Oct 16, when the blackmailer realized that Tushar wasn't about to yield to his demands, he pinned a homophobic note on the hostel notice board outing him.
Says Tushar: “[t]he notice was first seen by one of my friends and removed by him. He brought it over to my room asking me if I was fine and talked with me for a while. Subsequently, sometime during the night, a similar notice was put up with a terse handwritten note at the end “YOU CAN KEEP REMOVING IT. I WILL PRINT MORE“.
Thus outed to the entire hostel, Tushar, who had only been out to his closest friends until then, chose to respond with the following note on the same notice board:
Tushar, who describes himself as ‘shy and a bit introverted' said he felt relieved upon writing the note. Classmates and fellow-hostelites came up to him to express their support. In the weeks since the incident, he, with the support of friends, lodged a complaint with the university administration. At the time of publishing this note, he is still awaiting formal action in response.
Episodes such as these suggest that even large, supposedly progressive, campuses with support groups and allies, are not immune to bullying and harassment of LGBT students. It raises questions about the ability and willingness of the campus administration to respond swiftly and effectively to complaints received.
The familiarity of the perpetrator with the campus, hostel and locations where he asked the money to be placed, strongly suggests that he is a student, causing his actions to fall within the purview of ragging. The 1998 amendment of the Karnataka Education Act includes in its definition of ragging “causing, inducing, compelling or forcing a student… to do any act which detracts from human dignity or violates his person or exposes him to ridicule or to forbear from doing any lawful act, by intimidating., wrongfully restraining, wrongfully confining, or injuring him or by using criminal force to him or by holding out to him any threat of such intimidation, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, injury or the use of criminal force” [1].
Further, the University Grants Commission regulations on ragging, released in 2009, include extortion within their definition [2]. Such anti-ragging policies need to be made explicitly inclusive of homophobic and transphobic bullying, as well.
Finally, while the current Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Act [3] is limited to redressal for ciswomen, we urgently need measures to address sexual harassment, including blackmail and outing threats, of queer and trans individuals who are not ciswomen.
Some Orinam resources to make educational institutions more LGBTIQ* inclusive are here [4], and a list of campus LGBT initiatives including Queer IISc collective is here [5].
We at Orinam are aware that coming out [6] is not a universal or readily available prophylactic for such expressions of homophobia as blackmail and extortion [7], and recognise that such forced outing can have disastrous consequences for many. We also realise that for some of us who are visibly different in our gender expression, being in the closet is not even an option.
The caveats notwithstanding, we applaud Tushar for his courageous response, and stand in solidarity with him and the queer/trans and ally communities at IISc in their efforts to obtain justice.
Tushar is also planning to speak out to his peers on sexuality issues, and hopes that other queer students will find this to be a source of support. He eventually plans to come out to his parents, a rite of passage that – while considered before – hasn't happened yet.
A shout-out to the friends who have supported him at this time. In the words of Anubhav, a member of the campus LGBT support group Queer IISc who accompanied Tushar to the university administration, “Our friends supported us irrespective of orientation, because a crime is a crime, and victims are our friends, relatives, people who we care for, not ‘gays', ‘lesbians' or ‘transgenders'“.

A man is facing three charges of first-degree murder after an apparent crossbow attack in Scarborough.
Brett Ryan, 35, of Toronto, will appear in court later on Friday. The names of the victims have not been released.
Three people suffering from what appeared to be wounds from a crossbow died in Toronto on Thursday in an incident that rocked an otherwise quiet neighbourhood in the city's east end.
Police said an injured fourth person – a 35-year-old man – was taken into custody, but few other details of what happened were released.
On Friday, Const. David Hopkinson said that in 2008, Ryan was charged in relation to a string of bank robberies.
At the time, Ryan was dubbed the “fake beard bandit” for the disguise he allegedly used, Hopkinson said. He was charged with 14 counts of robbery, 14 counts of wearing a disguise and three counts of possessing dangerous weapons. It's unclear what happened to those charges.
The victims were found in the driveway of a bungalow near Eglinton Avenue East and Markham Road by officers who responded to a stabbing report around 1 p.m.
Indications were that (a) person had been stabbed – their injuries were fairly serious,” Hopkinson said on Thursday. “When officers arrived, they found that person and two others suffering from injuries from what we believe to be a crossbow bolt.”
Three people – two men and a woman – were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. A crossbow was found nearby on the floor.
Police, who immediately swarmed the area, were not looking for any suspects, Hopkinson said.
About four hours after the incident, police said there was a link between the deaths and a suspicious package found in downtown Toronto. They said the downtown scene, which was near a building housing a daycare, was declared safe by 5 p.m.
In the east-end neighbourhood of Scarborough, however, streets remained blocked off Thursday evening as police continued to investigate.
Vijaya Cruz, whose house backs on to the bungalow where the incident is believed to have taken place, said she was home with her husband Thursday afternoon when he heard a commotion.
“My husband said he heard some screaming, someone was screaming there,” she said. “Then he said he heard ‘bang, bang, bang' noise, and then someone was saying ‘calm down.'”
Cruz said she soon saw the flashing lights of a fire truck which was among the emergency crews that responded to the scene. Police later knocked on her door and told her three people had died in an incident involving a crossbow.
Cruz said she had seen a couple in the bungalow's backyard on occasion, but said she didn't know much about them.
“I see them working in the garden, a man and a woman, I see them with a wheelbarrow, cleaning up the yard,” she said. “They don't talk.”
Faiza Siddiqui, who lives on an adjoining street next to a park, said the incident was disturbing.
“It's scary because this park is always full with kids,” she said. “You don't hear about people being killed by crossbows, especially in the city. I don't know why you would need that in the city, have it around the house.”
Sadiya Haque, who also lives nearby, added that the neighbourhood was typically a tranquil one, with many seniors living on the street where the incident took place.
Dale Lounsbury, who sells crossbows at a sporting goods store in Waterloo, and owns one himself, said they can be dangerous due to their power and accuracy. But they are not suited to firing multiple shots in quick succession, he said.
“Crossbows are not a rapid-fire instrument at all,” Lounsbury said. “I can probably fire two shots a minute, maybe three.”
Unlike guns, buying a crossbow does not require a licence.
In December 2010, a man fired a bolt into his father's back at a Toronto public library branch in another crossbow incident that captured the city's attention. In that case, Zhou Fang then crushed his 52-year-old father's skull with a hammer.
Fang was initially charged with first-degree murder but the prosecution accepted a plea of second-degree murder after considering that he was the victim of long-term abuse at the hands of his father.
He was sentenced to life in prison in 2012.

Investigators say the tainted Maxtor portable hard disc, made by Seagate, uploads information saved on the computer automatically to Web sites in Beijing
A shipment of Maxtor external HDDs, produced in Thailand by US-based Seagate and sold in Taiwan, has been found to be infected with Autorun trojans designed to gather sensitive data from machines connected to the storage devices. According to local reports, the Taiwanese government suspects Chinese involvement, as the devices are commonly used in government operations to provide data storage. Large amounts of sensitive government data are thought to have been harvested and passed on to web-sites based in China.
Following findings by the Investigation Bureau that portable hard discs produced by US hard drive manufacturer Seagate Technology that were sold in Taiwan contained Trojan horse viruses, further investigations suggested that “contamination” took place when the products were in the hands of Chinese subcontractors during the manufacturing process.
On Saturday, Seagate Technology LLC, the manufacturer of the Maxtor portable hard drive, said on its Web site (www.seagate.com) that Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 hard drives sold after August could be infected with the virus.
Anti-virus software manufacturer Kaspersky Labs also issued a similar warning. The hard drive has been temporarily pulled off the shelves and is no longer available for purchase…

Takeaway coffee cups piling up in landfill as Australia's caffeine habit soars
Updated
Australia's ever-growing caffeine habit could be doing more damage than we think, with environmentalists warning disposable coffee cups are fast on their way to becoming a major pollution hazard.
Key points: Many disposable coffee cups contain thin layer of plastic
Australians use an estimated 1 billion cups each year
Environmentalist warns of major pollution hazard
Greens senator says planet will end up 'choking' from plastic
Disposable coffee cups, which look like they are made of paper, have been found to contain plastics that do not break down and are damaging to the environment.
"These cups have a plastic lining that, when they go away, either end up in landfill — they don't biodegrade — or they end up in the environment where they become a major pollution hazard," environmentalist Tim Silverwood told 7.30.
"Even though the paper may degrade and become inert, the plastic will stick around for a really long time."
Coffee cups are estimated to be the second-largest contributor to litter waste after plastic bottles.
It is estimated Australians use 1 billion disposable coffee cups each year.
Richard Fine, who founded biodegradable coffee cup manufacturer Biopak a decade ago, estimated up to 90 per cent of all disposable cups ended up in landfill, equating to around 60,000 kilograms of plastic waste per annum.
"We're working hard to fix that up though. We think that cups can be recycled and should be recycled," he said.
Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who is heading an inquiry into plastics, said plastic in oceans was the world's biggest global pollution problem.
"They are so small and dangerous — they can get inside the stomachs of fish and other marine creatures," he told 7.30.
"The ocean is turning into a plastic soup and, given the ocean is the source of all life on this planet, we are going to end up choking."
What about recyclable cups?
Truly recyclable cups are being made, but this option comes at a price and not all cafe owners are willing to wear that cost.
Some disposable coffee cups claim to be recyclable, some claim to be compostable and others are sold as biodegradable, but Mr Fine said these claims could be misleading for a number of reasons.
Recyclable: Whether a plastic-coated paper cup is recyclable varies from area to area, with some local councils accepting coffee cups as part of their recycling process, while others exclude them and dump them in landfill.
Compostable: When the materials of these cups break down, they are supposed to be suitable for using in compost. However composting is not widely available in Australia, so cups are put in household or community compost. Most compostable coffee cups still end up in landfill.
Biodegradable: Generally, this involves using an additive in the oil-based plastic lining which will break down when deprived of oxygen. But the scientific evidence has not sufficiently proven that this does in fact work.
What's the solution?
There are four practical things that you can do to reduce coffee cup landfill that will not mean giving up your daily coffee ritual.
Don't take away — drink your coffee from ceramic cups at the cafe
Bring your own reusable cup
Refuse a lid — if you don't need the lid don't take one
Choose a cup made from rapidly renewable resources like managed plantation paper board and separate the lid from the cup when disposing of the rubbish

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Russell Brand criticised Nigel Farage as a "pound shop Enoch Powell" for his views on immigration
Russell Brand and Nigel Farage have continued to trade insults following their Question Time clash.
Both panellists wrote articles attacking the other in the aftermath of the BBC show.
On his blog, comedian and campaigner Brand called the UKIP leader an "an end of the pier, end of the road, end of days politician".
Mr Farage wrote on the Independent website that Brand had been exposed as a "messiah with feet of clay".
The two men were joined on Thursday night's show by Conservative Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt, shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh, and Times columnist Camilla Cavendish.
'Discredited'
In an often heated debate, with members of the audience yelling at each other and the panel, Brand called Mr Farage a "pound shop Enoch Powell" during a section on immigration, with the UKIP leader responding by saying he believed the UK was "overcrowded".
The barbs did not stop when filming ended, as Mr Farage said the performance of the "sometime comedian turned banker-basher" had been "limp".
He wrote: "Mr Brand will swan around and tout long-discredited, even conspiratorial, theories about the City of London, and 'who owns politicians' - but actually he had very little to give."
For his part, Brand said Mr Farage was "worse than stagnant, he is a tribute act, he is a nostalgic spasm for a Britain that never was; an infinite cricket green with no-one from the colonies to raise the game, grammar schools on every corner and shamed women breastfeeding under giant parasols".
'Raging'
The breastfeeding reference followed a row over Mr Farage's suggestion that some venues might ask mothers to "perhaps sit in a corner" to feed their babies.
Both men praised the audience of Question Time, which was filmed in Canterbury.
Brand, who was urged to stand for Parliament by one man in the crowd. added: "The only worthwhile sentiments, be they raging or insightful, come from the audience".
Other questions focused on the NHS, grammar schools and trust in politicians.
The programme was watched by an average of 3.5 million viewers, with the audience peaking at 4.6 million at the start.
This was nearly a million higher than the previous week's episode, but well below the 7.9 million viewers who watched ex-BNP leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the show in 2009.
The encounter also triggered plenty of debate on social media, with 106,000 tweets during the show - compared with 22,000 the week before.

Nathan Pryor was getting frustrated by news of Trump administration policies that he disagrees with.
So he did what any a self-described designer, programmer and "tinkerer" would do: He hacked into an Amazon gizmo designed to instantly order consumer goods for the home and made it donate $5 to the American Civil Liberties Union with every press, instead.
OK, so maybe that's not something anyone would do. Pryor credits his friend Katherine with the idea, but his follow-through on the execution has made donating to the ACLU as easy as, well, pressing a button.
"I would love to see these become a real product that organizations across the political spectrum could offer," Pryor, who is based in Vancouver, Washington, told NBC News on Wednesday. "The more that can be done to lessen the friction of giving, the more people will donate, and I think the immediacy of it would increase their sense of involvement."
Pryor, who started work on the coding script on Jan. 30, said the project was actively donating to the ACLU by 11 o'clock that night. He printed out an ACLU logo and glued it onto the button, and it was ready to go.

Amazon introduced the Dash Button in 2015 to allow frazzled consumers to reorder essential home supplies by literally pressing a button that sticks to a surface at home. For example, the "Cascade" Dash Button might be slapped onto a dishwasher, and the "Charmin" button might go next to a toilet paper roll.
The Dash Button quickly became a favorite hobby project for hackers and "maker" types, who invented hacks that allowed users to control lights, build a silent doorbell and track work hours all with a single push.
Amazon responded by releasing a developer kit and a customizeable "Internet of Things" button called the AWS IoT. Amazon didn't respond immediately to a request for comment.
Pryor's version looks to be one of the first Dash Buttons that donates to a charitable cause, and he told NBC News that he's already pressed it enough times to have donated about $30 over the past week. When asked to pinpoint which moments in Trump administration policy led to each button smash, he said it was hard to choose from "a long list."
"The biggest issue for me so far has been the immigration orders," Pryor said. "To me, that one crosses the line into unconstitutional territory, rather than being just a disagreement about policy."
He's got a lot of ideas about how to implement a nonprofit donation button on a large scale, too. Pryor told NBC News that use of the buttons among supporters could provide "great feedback" to an organization.
"If 10,000 people pushed to donate within 10 minutes of a policy announcement, while another announcement brought only a trickle through the day, the organization would have a new perspective on what mattered to its donors," Pryor said.
Others seem to share his desire for a super-simple instantaneous way to donate to the ACLU. After learning about Pryor's hack through a Medium post and a slew of news reports, coder Michael Arthur Aguirre posted on Facebook that he was "programming a couple of these right now," telling friends to "hit me up if you want one."
The ACLU didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but the ACLU of Washington retweetedan article about the button, calling the project "so cool."
England's under-21 team recorded an impressive 3-2 victory over Germany at the Riverside Stadium on Monday as their Euro 2015 preparations continued. Gareth Southgate's side had already beaten this summer's hosts, the Czezh Republic, and will now be fancied as one of the pre-tournament favourites following another morale boosting victory. But how many of the players in last night's starting line-up can harbour serious hopes of forcing their way into Roy Hodgson's Euro 2016 squad?
Goalkeeper: Jonathan Bond
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 1/10
The young Watford stopper has been limited to three Championship outings this season behind experienced Brazilian, Huerelho Gomes. Goalkeepers rarely break through at the highest level at such a young age, and Bond's chances of replacing Joe Hart in time for Euro 2016 are minute.

Defender: Carl Jenkinson
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 6/10
Reports this week suggest he is free to make a permanent move from Arsenal to West Ham this summer despite impressing in the Irons back four. Like the majority of his predecessors, Hodgson tends to favour players at clubs in the Champions League, which could signal trouble for Jenkinson unless he manages to force himself into contention with the Gunners.

Defender: Luke Garbutt
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 5/10
It's difficult to imagine the 21 year-old breaking into Hodgson's plans anytime soon, even though he's enjoying a dream run in Everton's first team following an injury to Leighton Baines. The left back has already racked up ten England under-21 caps, but finds the likes of Kieran Gibbs, Luke Shaw and Danny Rose ahead of him in England's pecking order. Not to mention Toffees team-mate, Baines.

Defender: John Stones
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 8/10
If the young Everton centre-half continues on his current upward trajectory the big question next summer will be who partners him at the heart of England's back four. He was rewarded for an impressive breakthrough season at Goodison with a place on Hodgson's standby list for the 2014 World Cup, and should - in the eyes of many - already feature in England's senior side. The worry for Everton will be whether Stones decide he must find a new club in order to force his way in from the periphery of Hodgson's plans.

Defender: Ben Gibson
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 2/10
With under-21 team-mate John Stones struggling to break into England's senior squad, the chances of Middlesbrough rookie Gibson forcing his way through are somewhat remote. The 22 year-old is enjoying his second campaign as a defensive stalwart in the Championship, and looked suitably at home surrounded by the comfort's of the Riverside Stadium for Monday's victory over Germany. Premier League football beckons, but England will have to wait.

Midfielder: Jake Forster-Caskey
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 2/10
Forster-Caskey celebrates his 21st birthday next month and has turned out for his country from under-16 level right up until Gareth Soutgate's under-21 side, where he's played 13 times. The Brighton midfielder would need to secure a move to one of England's top Premier League sides and make an immediate impact next season to stand any chance of featuring at Euro 2016. The son of ex-pro Darren Caskey and stepson to former Brighton forward Nick Forster will enjoy a bright future, even if he's forced to wait a few years for his big opportunity.

Midfielder: Jesse Lingard
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 4/10
Like many who rise through the youth academy at one of England's biggest clubs, Lingard is ploughing through his very own loan tour of the Championship. Man United's young attacking midfielder joined promotion chasers Derby on a short term deal this year having previously featured for Leicester, Birmingham and Brighton. We won't see him on the senior international stage until Louis van Gaal throws him into the deep end at United.

Midfielder: James Ward-Prowse
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 7/10
It was Southgate's skipper, James Ward-Prowse, who secured victory over Germany on Monday in what is proving a remarkable campaign for the 20 year-old. Hodgson admitted in November last year that he sees the Southampton youngster as a genuine contender for England's holding midfield berth, where Jack Wilshere's injury problems remain a problem and Michael Carrick, at 33, may be leaving his best years behind him.

Midfielder: Will Hughes
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 6/10
Derby's teenage sensation would already have the majority of a Premier League season under his belt had QPR not shattered Derby's promotion hopes in last year's play-off final. Remarkably, the 19 year-old secured his 13th under-21 cap this week, and has been strongly linked with a summer move to Liverpool. He'd find it tricky establishing himself in a team already featuring Jordan Henderson, Emre Can and Joe Allen, but expect England recognition to follow very quickly if, as expected, the Liverpool move goes through.

Winger: Nathan Redmond
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 3/10
It was a little surprising that no Premier League club took a chance on Redmond when Norwich were relegated to the second tier last term. The lightening quick winger demonstrated flashes of brilliance in the top flight, but must add more goals to his game if he wants to stand out compared with Hodgson's more established wide players. Three goals in 27 Championship matches for the Canaries won't be enough to tempt Hodgson, or any top flight manager for that matter, into taking a punt on his services.

Forward: Danny Ings
Chances of playing at Euro 2016: 6/10
Another player strongly linked with Liverpool, it's not easy imagining how Ings might win a place in England's Euro 2016 squad. Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck are pretty much certain to be included if they're all fit, while Harry Kane is expected to cement his senior spot between now and the end of the season. Charlie Austin has scored more Premier League goals than Ings this season, and he too was overlooked this month.
Asiana Airlines pilot was training to fly jet that crashed in San Francisco
Updated
Asiana Airlines says the pilot in charge of landing a plane that crashed short of the runway at San Francisco airport was in training for the long-range jet.
The Boeing 777 was en route from Seoul when its crash landed and burst into flames at the weekend, killing two Chinese teenagers.
Passengers managed to evacuate the plane via emergency slides before the fire took hold but local authorities say more than 180 people were injured, at least two dozen of them seriously.
A spokeswoman for Asiana said it was pilot Lee Kang-kook's first flight to the airport with the jet.
"He was in training. Even a veteran gets training (for a new jet)," she said.
Key points Asiana plane crashed short of the runway at San Francisco Airport
The airline says the pilot was in training to fly the Boeing 777 jet
Two Chinese teenagers were killed and more than 180 passengers injured
The most severely injured suffered paralysis, fractures, head trauma and internal bleeding
Two people had road rash, suggesting they were dragged
Investigators are hunting for clues as to what caused the plane to crash
The pilots will be interviewed in the coming days
"He has a lot of experience and has previously flown to San Francisco on different planes including the B747... and he was assisted by another pilot who has more experience with the 777."
She said the pilot, who started his career at Asiana as an intern in 1994, had 9,793 hours of flying experience, but only 43 hours with the Boeing 777 jet.
The US National Transportation Safety Board said the plane was travelling "significantly below" its intended speed and its crew tried to abort the landing just seconds before it hit the seawall in front of the runway.
Officials say it is too early to determine whether pilot error or mechanical failure are to blame for the crash. The control tower was not alerted to any plane issues.
The pilots are due to be interviewed in the coming days.
Doctor reveals survivors' severe injuries
Meanwhile, a doctor has revealed the extent of injuries suffered by passengers on board the plane.
Margaret Knudson, interim surgery chief at the San Francisco General Hospital, says the most severely injured are paralysed, unconscious or dealing with serious abdominal bleeding.
"[Doctors saw] large amounts of abdominal injuries, a huge amount of spine fracture, some of which include paralysis, and head trauma and multiple type of orthopaedic injuries," she said.
"[Two patients] had severe road rash, suggesting they were dragged. Not sure if those patients were outside of the plane and this is what happened to them but both of those patients are alive."
She says all of the patients who are able to speak told doctors they had been sitting in the back of the jet, where the tail broke off as the plane smashed into the end of the runway.
But she says 15 or 16 patients have not yet regained consciousness.
"Some of our patients have been operated on twice already, and there's going to be many many more surgeries to come still," she said.
Flight 214 originated in Shanghai, and had 307 people on board - 291 passengers and 16 crew.
Witnesses reported seeing a fireball and said the aircraft spun around before coming to rest on its belly at the end of the runway.
The crash sheared off the plane's landing gear and tore the tail off the fuselage. Large portions of the plane's body were burned out in the fire that then erupted.
The head of the Asiana airline, Yoon Young-doo, says the Boeing 777 jet did not have mechanical problems when it crashed.
"For now, we acknowledge that there were no problems caused by the 777-200 plane or [its] engines," he said.
Mr Yoon has declined to comment directly on whether the crash was due to pilot error.
San Francisco's fire chief Joanne Hayes-White says the airline crew on board showed great heroism and professionalism.
"My understanding is the crew of Asiana airlines did a phenomenal job in making sure that passengers first and they stayed on to make sure that everyone was brought to safety," she said.
"I interacted with one of the crew managers, and she was actually so composed I actually thought that she was brought in from the terminal and she actually had evacuated herself off the plane."
Most of the passengers were from China, Korea and the US. Asiana says the two teenage girls who died had been seated at the back of the aircraft.
The Boeing 777, a family of twin-engined long-haul aircraft, is rated as one of the safest aircraft in the world and has been since it started flying in 1995.
There are more than 1,100 in service, with a rate of one accident for every 18 million hours of flying time. This is the first fatal accident involving the aircraft.

Truck Yeah The trucks are good!
It's the Easter Jeep Safari, the time of year when Jeep teases the world with unattainable concept vehicles that us ordinary humans will never be able to attain. But this year is different. Jeep did what we all would do and bought a ‘90s ZJ Grand Cherokee off of Craigslist.
The ZJ debuted back in ‘92, so this marks the 25th anniversary of the car.
This one in particular is a 1993 Grand Cherokee that Jeep itself bought on Craigslist. Lengthened wheelbase, standard 318 motor, standard four speed trans. Beefy axles.

To be more precise, Jeep gave this thing a 2" lift, and the longer wheelbase comes from moving the front axle 2" forward, the rear three inches back. Longer control arms get the job done, and shaving the body makes it all fit.

For extreme period-correctness, there's an in-car phone, a David Hasselhoff sticker and a Game Boy in the back seat.
Also dig the paint, which is extremely lovely. You can see how much it makes the car stand out compared to the white-over-grey two-tone it had when bought.

Nostalgia is coming off of this Jeep in physical waves. It rules.
(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp investors on Wednesday rejected a shareholder proposal to prohibit the world's biggest coffee chain from making political contributions or forming a political action committee.

The Starbucks board had recommended rejection of the proposal, sponsored by shareholder John Harrington, chief executive of Harrington Investments. It was introduced at the annual meeting by a representative of Corporate Accountability International, where Harrington is a board member.
Two years ago, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz organized scores of fellow CEOs to boycott campaign contributions until lawmakers came up with a plan to fix the nation's financial woes.
Even though Starbucks has not contributed to political campaigns in recent years, directors said a policy forbidding contributions would hobble the company's ability to promote policies needed to deliver strong results and could put it at a “marked disadvantage” with competitors.
The breakdown of votes was not immediately available.
The Seattle-based company's corporate policy allows contributions to candidates, political action committees or state ballot measures. But over the last three years, Starbucks made no direct political contributions and did not operate a political action committee, according to the annual report to shareholders.
The company did pay dues to trade organizations that lobbied lawmakers.
During the shareholder meeting, Starbucks reiterated its 2013 revenue and earnings growth targets.
It also announced a $1 million seed grant to support a new job training program called LeadersUP and said it would expand sales of U.S.-made coffee mugs through a new relationship with Ohio-based American Pioneer Manufacturing, which later this year will begin supplying 100,000 mugs annually.
Over the last two years, Starbucks is one of 125 companies to face shareholder proposals related to political spending, according to a March 7 report by the Sustainable Investments Institute, which tracks political spending and corporate governance issues.
In votes held this year, 37 percent of Visa Inc's voting shareholders and 31 percent of those of Accenture Plc supported proposals to disclose contributions for lobbying, according to filings from both companies.
Shares of Starbucks, which hit an all-time high of nearly $62 in April 2012, were up 1.3 percent at $57.58 on Wednesday afternoon.
Keith Ellison has been the subject of much attention from Democrats and progressive independents since Bernie Sanders endorsed him to be the new chairperson of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in December. While some progressives see Ellison as far from being a perfect choice to lead the DNC, many share the Sanders view that Ellison would be a better choice than the other candidates running in terms of moving toward a more open and inclusive Democratic Party rather than the heavily corporate-sponsored party it has become, in their view. Ellison's chief competitor in the DNC chair race is the former labor secretary under Barack Obama, Tom Perez.
null
The race is still too close to call. According to reports, 447 Democratic Party insiders will be voting for the new chairperson at the DNC's annual winter meeting to be held this coming weekend, so popular support is not really an effective barometer in determining who might win. However, many Bernie supporters have been extremely vocal in their desire for Ellison and their efforts could be paying off. According to the Hill, of 240 voting members of the DNC whose choices have been surveyed by the website's researchers, 105 support Keith Ellison, 57 support Tom Perez, and the remaining DNC voters are either undecided or support one of the other candidates, none of whom have more than a dozen supporters out of those surveyed.
It's perhaps telling that the race for DNC chair has seemingly come down to Perez vs. Ellison. To a certain extent, it is a proxy battle for the future of the Democratic Party, with Perez representing the Barack Obama wing of the party and Ellison representing the Bernie Sanders wing who wish to see the party take a decidedly less corporate, more populist direction.
null
Ellison has also received endorsements from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer, Georgia Congressman John Lewis, and most recently Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. Perez counts as his supporters former attorney general under Barack Obama, Eric Holder, and former Vice President Joe Biden.
According to CNN, Representative John Lewis explained exactly why he's supporting Keith Ellison. The endorsement comes as somewhat of a surprise, as Lewis was not a supporter of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 primary. That Ellison has managed to win his endorsement could be a sign that Ellison has effectively managed to reach out to members of the party who may have been skeptical of a takeover of the party by Sanders progressives.
“We need his leadership. We need his vision. We need his commitment and his dedication now more than ever before,” Lewis said. “Keith wants our party not just to wait until the next election but to organize now for the long haul.”
Interestingly, President Donald Trump decided to tweet words in vague support of Ellison this morning, praising Ellison for being among the few Democrats who predicted Trump's victory. Trump's intentions can only be guessed, but it's possible he feels that offering support for Ellison could negatively impact the view of Ellison in the eyes of DNC voters, perhaps suggesting that Trump would rather Ellison not lead the DNC.
null
Keith Ellison quickly responded to Trump's tweet.
null
According to the Hill, it is also entirely possible that the stark divide between those who want Perez and those who want Ellison could inspire the DNC voters to choose a compromise candidate rather than choose one or the other. This doesn't seem entirely likely, as none of the other candidates currently have a ton of known support, but if there is a deadlock in early voting, someone could emerge, such as South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has received praise in recent weeks from former DNC chairman Howard Dean. Many progressives would like to see insurgent candidate Sam Ronan elected to DNC chair, according to a previous Inquisitr article.
Regardless of who becomes the next DNC chairperson, the Democratic Party will need to focus on rebuilding in the coming years. The 2016 election could be seen as either a harbinger of doom for a party that never learned from its mistakes, or a turning point where lessons were learned, the party regrouped, and came back with new ideas and goals. While not everyone may feel that Ellison, or Perez, or whoever wins is the best choice, it is not just one person who will ultimately decide the future of the Democratic Party.

In two giant airtight vats at Harvest Power's Energy Garden in central Florida, quadrillions of microorganisms are feasting on orange peels, wilted lettuce, burnt bread crusts, and other food discarded by humans. In less than a month, these ravenous creatures consume waste that would have taken years to decompose in a landfill.
Better yet, they release immense amounts of gas — biogas, to be exact. This heady mix of roughly 60 pecent methane and 40 percent carbon dioxide is fed into generators to produce electricity to help power area businesses.

We examine when and how to best run your own data center versus when to outsource to the cloud or a service provider, and when to take a hybrid approach. Read More
“A biogas system is a great way to solve a lot of problems,” says Chris Peters, the Harvest Power Regional Vice President overseeing the Florida Energy Garden. “It diverts material from landfills, creates sustainable electricity, and produces useful byproducts in the form of fertilizer and treated wastewater. It's a win-win.”
Hosted by Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), which was created in the 1960s to provide infrastructure services for Walt Disney World and now also serves other businesses in Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake, Florida, Harvest Power's Energy Garden was unveiled in February 2014. The facility began by collecting food waste from Walt Disney World's table-service restaurants and has quickly drawn additional customers in central Florida, where Peters say an average of 24 pounds of food waste is sent to landfill every second.
Harvest is currently processing food waste at a rate of 45,000 tons per year, including 15,000 tons from RCID and 30,000 tons from other sources. This food waste is combined with fats, oils and grease (FOG) and biosolids (treated sewage) for a total of 120,000 tons of organic waste being handled by the plant per year.
Once prepared, the waste is fed into 1.2 million-gallon tanks where anaerobic (meaning without oxygen) digestion takes place. The carefully balanced blend of waste and warm temperatures optimize conditions for the microorganisms to thrive, feed and produce the all-important biogas.
Biogas is released by food waste in landfills too, albeit much more slowly, and most of the methane escapes into the atmosphere instead of being contained. Methane is a harmful greenhouse gas so containing it in a biogas plant has an immediate environmental benefit.
The biogas at Harvest's Florida Energy Garden creates 27 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year, enough to power 2,300 homes, and is sold to RCID to help keep the lights on at Walt Disney World, among other places. In addition, Harvest sells fertilizer and irrigation water gleaned from the anaerobic digestion process.
Anaerobic digestion is not a new technology. “It's a microbial process that's been around since the beginning of time — the same thing happens in a cow's stomach,” points out Patrick Serfass, Executive Director of the American Biogas Council, founded in 2010 and based in Washington, DC. But biogas facilities are more common in Europe, especially in Germany, because of a shortage of landfill space, high energy costs, and a more favorable political climate for renewable energy alternatives, according to Serfass.

Still, Serfass says there have been biogas plants in the US for many decades, mostly at wastewater treatment facilities. What's new is a focus on using these systems to process some of the 133 billion pounds of food wasted in America each year. Cleanworld in Sacramento recently started a biogas plant that converts community food waste into power for the University of California at Davis. Kroger, the largest grocery store chain in America, processes spoiled food from Ralphs and Food 4 Fewer stores at a biogas facility to power its distribution center in Compton, California.
Several high-profile businesses near Harvest Power's Florida Energy Garden have already climbed aboard the biogas bandwagon. Organic produce company FreshPoint Central Florida, produce distributor Taylor Farms, and hotels including the Waldorf Astoria Orlando and Grande Lakes Orlando has all struck deals to send food waste to Harvest Power.
At the Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek & Waldorf Astoria Orlando, Managing Director Peter Kacheris says that food waste from all 13 of the complex's restaurants will eventually be directed to Harvest instead of landfills — plus the complex plans to buy fertilizer byproducts from Harvest for its 18-hole golf course. “It's cost-effective and also allows us to make a difference through sustainable actions,” says Kacheris, who projects that making the change will reduce the hotels' garbage bill by about ten percent.
Large-scale diversion of food waste from landfills to biogas plants will require a shift in attitude and behavior on the part of both businesses and consumers, but Serfass says there will come a time when recycling food waste will seem as commonplace as recycling a glass bottle.
“It's a crime that we have organic waste not being recycled and not being turned into renewable energy,” says Serfass. “We have the technology — we just have to get restaurants and grocery stores and communities to think of this waste as a resource.”
A commentary on
Obesity and the brain: how convincing is the addiction model?
by Ziauddeen, H., Farooqi, I. S., and Fletcher, P. C. (2012). Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 13, 279–286.
An article published in April 2012 by the Nature Reviews Neuroscience (Ziauddeen et al., 2012) calls for cautiousness in applying the addiction model to obesity. This scrupulous review described the highly consequential results from B. Hoebel's lab concerning binge-like eating behaviors of rats (Avena et al., 2008, 2009; Bocarsly et al., 2011). Referring to these results, Ziauddeen and colleagues concluded that the binge behaviors relate to the palatability of the foods independently of their macronutrient composition. Earlier, also basing on the works of Hoebel and colleagues, I have been able to draw quite a different conclusion – fat per se, although highly palatable, is not as addictive as carbohydrates and is not obesogenic (Zilberter, 2011). In yet another paper (Peters, 2012), A. Peters interpreted results of Avena et al. (2008) as a proof that “sugar addiction” fails causing obesity. Here, I take a closer look at the Hoebel's model of addiction (Avena et al., 2008, 2009; Berner et al., 2009; Avena, 2010; Avena and Gold, 2011; Bocarsly et al., 2011) while keeping in mind the role of macronutrients.
Food Addiction
An opinion exists that rather than an observational link, a causality exists between food addiction and obesity (Gold, 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Corsica and Pelchat, 2010; Johnson and Kenny, 2010). Another opinion is that such a causality does not exist (Peters, 2012) or even that a mere link between them should be considered with caution (Ziauddeen et al., 2012). The caution notwithstanding, it has been shown (and is discussed by Ziauddeen et al., 2012) that drug addiction and food addiction have similar effects, e.g., on the dopaminergic system (Volkow et al., 2008; Gearhardt et al., 2009; Stice and Dagher, 2010) where they “overlap” (Avena et al., 2012). In human subjects, food addiction has been associated with similar patterns of neural activation as substance addiction in anterior cingulated cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala (Gearhardt et al., 2011b). “Common hedonic mechanisms may therefore underlie obesity and drug addiction,” concluded Johnson and Kenny (2010). Addiction liability is being discussed inline with development of obesity pharmacotherapy (Greene et al., 2011).
Carbohydrate Addiction
Carbohydrate (CHO) bias in brain's control of energy homeostasis (Zilberter, 2011) reveals itself in several well known ways including the phenomena termed “positive reward,” “hedonism,” “wanting,” “liking,” etc. (Berridge et al., 2010; Gold, 2011). The “sweet-addiction” comparable by magnitude with alcohol addiction (Kampov-Polevoy et al., 2003) and drug addictions (Stoops et al., 2010) is well documented. Gold (2011) argued that deficit in “reward” is coupled with obesity and this coupling is common for sugar, cocaine, and heroin addictions.
Gearhardt et al. (2011b), referring to the aforementioned work of Johnson and Kenny, argued that only “hyper-palatable” foods rich in fat and sugar can cause addiction. Indeed, the combination of fat and sugar resulted in a “reward dysfunction associated with drug addiction and compulsive eating, including continued consumption despite receipt of shocks” (Gearhardt et al., 2011a). A link between food addiction and obesity has also been explicitly postulated (Avena et al., 2009; Corsica and Pelchat, 2010; Gold, 2011).
Fat Addiction?
Studies from B. Hoebel lab suggest that access to CHO produces different addiction-like behaviors compared with access to fat (Avena and Gold, 2011; Bocarsly et al., 2011; Avena et al., 2012). Nutrient specificity in control of eating behavior was also shown in this lab (Berner et al., 2009). During the “sweet-chow” feeding protocol, rats compensated for the increased sucrose or glucose calories by decreasing chow intake. The authors (Avena et al., 2008) suggested that the increase in sugar intake, while not resulting in obesity, lead to an upregulation of affinity for opioid receptors, which in turn leads to the vicious circle of sugar abuse and might contribute to obesity.
In a later study (Avena et al., 2009), when rats were given intermittent daily access to “sweet-fat” food, they voluntarily restricted their intake of standard chow, similar to what has been reported with “sweet-chow” food (Avena et al., 2008). However, this time rats did become overweight unlike in the “sweet-chow” experiment. Authors concluded: “fat may be the macronutrient that results in excess body weight, and sweet taste in the absence of fat may be largely responsible for producing addictive-like behaviors.” Yet pure fat, unlike the CHO-fat combination, lacks obesogenity (Dimitriou et al., 2000). Fat combined with limited CHO content failed to cause overeating and weight gain, while excess CHO in high-fat diets caused obesity and metabolic impairment (Lomba et al., 2009).
Metabolic studies show that CHO restriction in high-fat diets exerts neuroprotective effects (Figure 1) via induction of heat-shock proteins (Maalouf et al., 2009), growth factors (Maswood et al., 2004), and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (Liu et al., 2006). Naturally, CHO excess has neurodeteriorating effects as discussed in Zilberter (2011), Hipkiss (2008), or Manzanero et al. (2011).
FIGURE 1
Conclusion
Taking into account the well-defined metabolism-related features of a diet can help to avoid ambiguity in definition of diet types and aid in data interpretations. From this standpoint, macronutrients play a crucial role in determining diet's behavioral and metabolic consequences.

Under the old system, students could pass with a 65 — 389 of the 1,500 students at Mount Olive High had a “D” on their final report cards in June — but now anything lower than a 70 will be considered failure.
While few high schools have banned D's outright as Mount Olive has, some have sought to tamp downgrade inflation by quietly tightening their standards over the years. Several New Jersey high schools, for instance, have raised the minimum for D's to 70, which is traditionally the C-minus range, with anything below deemed an F.
Mount Olive, an above-average school in a middle-class community, is developing a support system to help students meet the tougher grading standard. When students receive a failing grade on a test, a paper or a homework assignment in the future, they will have three days to repeat the work for a C, and their parents will be notified by phone or e-mail.

Students who continue to fail will be placed on a “watch list” to receive extra-help classes, as well as tutoring from other students. If they need to make up a failed course, they will be given the option of attending an evening school, known as “Sunset Academy,” that will charge a fee of $150 per class.
The total cost of these support efforts to the district is expected to be less than $10,000, school officials said.
Max Werner, 17, an A-student whose father, Mark, is president of the school board, said he and his friends liked the no-D policy because no one should be satisfied with such a low mark. “People are going to have to try harder,” he said. “It's not like a nice college is going to see all D's on a report card and want to accept that student.”
Dr. Reynolds said he used a similar grading policy — “A, B, or do it over” — when teaching college classes in Wichita, Kan., in the late 1990s. About half of his students in those classes had to rewrite their initial papers, he recalled, but eventually nearly everyone was turning in work that merited an A or B. “I have never given less than a B,” he said.

In summer school last week, 79 Mount Olive High students were repeating classes they had failed during the year. Mark Fiedorczyk, the summer school principal, said he expected to see an increase next summer because of the no-D policy.

Still, Mr. Fiedorczyk, who teaches seventh-grade science during the year, said the higher standard was just what some students needed. In June, he handed out D's to a half-dozen students, all of whom, he said, were capable of C's if they had tried harder. Instead, they had skipped homework and projects, and showed up unprepared for tests.
“I have kids who walk the borderline,” he said. “They know it. They admit it. They calculate what they need to get the D.”
At which, another teacher joked: “Then they'll turn around and say they can't do math.”
For Aphrodite Georgakopoulos, 16, the no-D policy means she will have to work a lot harder to avoid summer school again. She is repeating world history and Algebra 2 after getting lazy about assignments or just giving up in frustration, she said.
“It's not like I can't do it; it's just that I won't push myself,” she said. “I don't know why. I need someone to be constantly on top of me, making sure I do everything.”
Down the hallway, Sean Robinson, 17, who is retaking Spanish, said he hoped that students would feel better about themselves in a D-free school, and that Mount Olive's higher standard would raise its profile in the region.
“Normally, I just wouldn't try, but I feel like if I did badly, I'd bring down my school's G.P.A.,” he said. “My mom will be happy.”
A Jerusalem mother of two was sent a threatening letter on Thursday, in yet another case of exclusion of women. In the letter, the woman was told she must leave the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood immediately, for having “crossed the limits of the Torah of Israel.”
R., who classified herself as belonging to the “Masorti” movement, has been living with her two small children in the central Jerusalem neighborhood of Mahane Israel for seven months. She says the haredi nature of the neighborhood was unbeknownst to her when she moved there, but until today has enjoyed peaceful relations with her neighbors.
A letter sent to R., demanding she leave the ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood of Mahane Israel, for having ‘crossed the limits of the Torah of Israel and modesty in our neighborhood.'
“I came back from America and needed an apartment urgently,” said R., “That's how I got here.” She added that she is not a malicious person, and has no desire to stir up anyone. “I do wear pants, but not short ones,” she explained.
But, on Thursday, R. received a letter demanding she leave the neighborhood immediately, for having transgressed the Jewish laws of modesty:
“[I]t will not happen here any longer. We are requesting you leave our neighborhood for having crossed the limits of the Torah of Israel and modesty in our neighborhood. We ask that you leave our neighborhood immediately. [Signed,] The Modesty Guard.” At the end of the letter were the words, “This is a first and final warning.”
R. filed a complaint at Israel Police, where policemen assured her that they would increase surveillance in the neighborhood. “I had a neighbor that ignored a warning like this and they burned down her house,” said R., “It's scary. I don't know how I'll leave the house tomorrow morning.”

About two weeks ago, during the Passover holiday, a young woman who went on stage at an event organized by the Modi'in municipality, was forced to get down immediately. She was replaced by only boys and men. The decision aroused a protest among audience members, who rejected the decision to replace the female volunteer with a male. At the peak of the incident, the performance was interrupted and was renewed for only a few minutes.

Vermont became the third state on Thursday to call on the U.S. Congress to overturn the Supreme Court's controversial ruling in Citizens United v. FEC.
The Vermont House passed the resolution by a 92-40 vote. The Vermont Senate passed the resolution 26-3 last week.
The 2010 Citizens United ruling struck down key provisions of the federal McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law and gave rise to super PACS, officially known as independent-expenditure only committees, which can raise an unlimited amount of money to influence federal elections as long as they do not directly coordinate with a candidate's campaign.
The ruling held that limiting corporate campaign spending violated the First Amendment, because political contributions were a form of political speech and corporations were legally persons.
“The General Assembly urges Congress to consider the request of many Vermont cities and towns to propose a U.S. constitutional amendment for the state's consideration that provides that money is not speech and corporations are not persons under the U.S. Constitution and that also affirms the constitutional rights of natural persons,” Vermont's resolution, authored by State Senator Ginny Lyons (D), stated.
Similar resolutions have passed in Hawaii and New Mexico.
“By fighting so passionately, Vermonters have put the state on the map as opposing corporate influence in our elections. Public Citizen is proud to have played a coordinating role with our Vermont partners in this movement victory,” said Aquene Freechild, senior organizer with Public Citizen's Democracy Is For People campaign.
GOP Warns NBC & CNN: Stop Promoting Hillary Clinton or Face Consequences
The GOP sent letters to CNN and NBC today warning them to cancel their pro-Hillary movies before the election or face a possible boycott.
Chairman Priebus said if the networks go ahead with their Hillary projects the Republican Party would boycott their presidential debates.
After the outrageous stunt CNN's Candy Crowley pulled in the 2012 debate the GOP should have already boycotted CNN from hosting future events.
But the Republican elites don't want to ruffle too many feathers.
The GOP reported:
Today Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sent a letter to Robert Greenblatt, Chairman of NBC Entertainment, and Jeff Zucker, President of CNN Worldwide, calling on their networks to cancel their attempts to influence Americans' political decisions. Both networks are airing programs promoting former Secretary Hillary Clinton ahead of her likely candidacy for president in 2016. NBC has announced plans to air a miniseries, while CNN is producing a documentary. If the productions are not canceled prior to the start of the RNC's Summer Meeting, Chairman Priebus will seek a binding vote of the RNC to prevent the committee from partnering with these networks in 2016 primary debates or sanctioning debates they sponsor.
The social sciences provide few controlled experiments; there is no Cern Laboratory for sociology or economics. But the 20th century provided something rather close.
The impoverished, war-torn Korean peninsula was split in two, the North trying communism and the South opting for capitalism. After 60 years South Koreans are on average three inches taller than North Koreans and live 12 years longer.
Germany and its capital city were split down the middle in 1945, the west going capitalist and the east going communist. The architects of the Workers' Paradise in the east had to build walls to stop the unappreciative proles escaping to the west to be exploited. And then the Workers' Paradise collapsed.
The results of these experiments have proved problematic for statists. In recent years the economist Ha-Joon Chang has become popular on the left for arguing that the economic success of West Germany and South Korea relative to their eastern and northern neighbours is not because of a lack of state intervention but because they had just the right kind of intervention in just the right amount. For Chang there is nothing inherently wrong with a Gosplan, you just have to make sure you have the right boffins drawing it up.
In his new book, Heavens on Earth, JP Floru utterly rejects this argument. He takes eight case studies, from Britain's Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries to Singapore's journey to prosperity, and argues that the spectacular results achieved came from the release of market forces. Where Chang prescribes intensive government involvement in the economy, Floru recommends that politicians and bureaucrats set up a solid legal framework then get out of the way.
Economically speaking, the source of the increase in wealth these countries experienced was increasing productivity, the production of as much with less or more with as much. The increase in the quantity of goods and services available for consumption which this permits are the essence of increasing wealth.
The Theory of Comparative Advantage, outlined by David Ricardo 200 years ago, extends this worldwide. As a unit a country will grow rich if it produces goods or services for which the inhabitants of other countries are willing to exchange the goods and services they have produced. And countries will see their terms of trade improve the more efficient, or productive, they are.
Floru's argument echoes that of Douglas Carswell's recent book The End of Politics, its central feature the ‘Hayekian Knowledge Problem'. Economics is, as Alfred Marshall wrote, “a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life. It examines that part of individual & social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of material requisites of well-being”.
It is not, as much mainstream neo-classical economics would suggest, the study of the allocation of given resources among known ends via some identified production function. It is, in fact, the study of the process of the discovery of all these things; resources, ends, and means.
The knowledge of how best to produce cars, linen, or financial services does not exist in some one place where one of Ha-Joon Chang's Platonic philosopher kings can simply go and get it prêt-à-porter. It is lurking somewhere, probably dispersed, in the vast collective brain made up of each individual in the wider economy, and it has to be discovered.
A free market economy is far better at tapping this collective brain and efficiently discovering and coordinating the hidden, dispersed information it contains than a state command system which relies on the brains of a handful of experts. That is the lesson of Korea and Germany.
There is an incredible amount of economic gloom as debts rocket, growth stagnates, and incomes fall in the developed world. But, as the United Nations recently reported,
“The world is witnessing a epochal 'global rebalancing' with higher growth in at least 40 poor countries, helping lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and into a new 'global middle class'. Never in history have the living conditions and prospects of so many people changed so dramatically and so fast”.
Thanks to free market capitalism more people are living better than ever before.
Since at least 1798, when Ricardo's friend Thomas Malthus predicted a destiny of misery for mankind, there have been people warning of an imminent end to our material progress. But whatever the situation with regard to his material resources, one truly inexhaustible resource man possesses is his (or her) ingenuity, or human capital in the economists' terminology. A system which allows for the maximum exploitation of this ingenuity, of its discovery and coordination, remains humanity's best hope for the ever more prosperous future which is on offer.
In 1776 Adam Smith wrote that “Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice”. JP Floru's excellent new book performs the vital service of reaffirming this fundamental lesson.

Defense & National Security
“For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction” is Newton's third law of physics.
Its counterpart in geopolitics is “blowback,” when military action in one sphere produces an unintended and undesirable consequence in another.
September 11, 2001, was blowback.
George H.W. Bush had sent an army of half a million to hurl Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, a triumph. He proceeded to impose severe sanctions on the Iraqis and to build U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia.
“Infidel” soldiers on sacred Islamic soil and the suffering of the Iraqi people under American sanctions were two of the causes Osama bin Laden listed in his declaration of war on the United States.
Our 3,000 dead on 9/11 were blowback for having established a neo-imperial presence in the Arabian Peninsula after Desert Storm.
In the African nation of Mali today, where al-Qaida and allies have seized the northern half of the country, Azawad, as large as Texas, we are witnessing blowback for President Obama's intervention in Libya.
How so? Due almost entirely to U.S.-backed NATO bombing, which prevented Moammar Gadhafi from crushing the uprising of 2011, the colonel was overthrown and murdered by rebels.
Tauregs from Mali, whom Gadhafi had brought into his army, fled or were expelled from Libya. Taking their heavy weapons, they returned to a country where their people had been mistreated and seized its northern half, to secede and create their own nation.

But the jihadists who fought alongside them to capture the north turned on them and drove them from power. Ansar Dine and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb — like the Taliban in Afghanistan who blew up the ancient Bamiyan Buddhas — then blew up all non-Islamic shrines and imposed a brutal form of Sharia law. Adulterers are subject to stonings. Thieves have their hands amputated.
This is but part of the strategic disaster, however. The U.S.-trained Malian army collapsed in the face of the rebellion. U.S.-trained Malian troops defected to the jihadists. A Malian captain trained at Ft. Benning overthrew the democratic government in Bamako and seized power.
This situation had festered for 10 months. Then, this month, the jihadists occupied Konna and threatened Mopti, south of the dividing line, and Islamists entering Mali from Mauritania seized Diabaly, only 250 miles from Bamako. The whole of Mali seemed about to fall to al-Qaida
France, whose colony Mali was, reacted. Prime Minister Francois Hollande sent planes to bomb the Islamists and 2,500 French soldiers to recapture Diabaly. That battle is now underway.
The 16-nation Economic Community of West African States has talked of raising an army to recapture the north. Thus far it has been just that, talk. While the United States has provided logistical and intelligence support to the French, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says there will be no U.S. boots on the ground.
French troops and air power can probably clear and hold the south, but who is going to march north to drive AQIM and its allies out?
Twenty-five hundred French soldiers could not both invade and hold Azawad. Even should they recapture northern towns like Timbuktu, they could not hold the region against a determined guerrilla war that al-Qaida and its allies could mount.
Yet Hollande says he will restore the territorial integrity of Mali.
French bombing is already causing civilian casualties. This could produce blowback in France, where thousands of Malians have emigrated. Many French yet remember the homeland terrorism as they fought their eight-year war from 1954 to 1962 to hold Algeria.
This week's seizure of Western hostages in Algeria is Islamist retaliation for Algeria's having allowed France to use its airspace in the attacks in Mali. And as Syria's civil war has brought jihadis on the run, an Islamist war against France in the Sahel region of Africa could do the same.
And how would Muslims of an inflamed Middle East accept another Western war against soldiers of the Prophet?
While Mali is of little geostrategic value, a huge and secure base camp for al-Qaida in northern Mali presents serious problems for the United States.
Al-Qaida in Mali is reportedly in contact with the terrorists of Boko Haram, who have been murdering Christians and burning their churches in Nigeria. And the reports that Islamists entered Mali from Mauritania suggest this cancer is metastasizing.
What should be done?
The United States cannot fight Mali's war. No vital interest is imperiled there, and this could lead to an Afghanistan in the heart of Africa. But if America is not going to take the lead in recapturing the Azawad for Mali, who is? France? ECOWAS? NATO? Algeria?
Without America, the will is not there, the weapons are not there, the troops are not there.
As we consider our options, however, let us hear no more from President Obama about al-Qaida being “on the run” and “on the path to defeat.”
In a taped interview that aired on Fox Tuesday, presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul told Bill Hemmer Planned Parenthood is “only about abortion,” and that not “one penny ever needs to go,” the million dollar lobby.
Planned Parenthood is “not objective, and they are not telling you the truth.” the medical doctor stated. The United States has recently “doubled the amount of money,” the government provides to community centers that, unlike Planned Parenthood, actually provide on-site health services to women, instead of “referring you to a real doctor or community health center.”
PAUL: I think this is bigger issue than just abortion. This is about taxpayer funding of a gruesome procedure, not just any old abortion, but an abortion of a fully formed baby where the baby is being manipulated and turned around to harvest the baby's organs. I think it's particularly horrific, and I think everybody should have voted against this. I'll continue to vote against this funding. There's no reason in the world we have to fund Planned Parenthood at all. Everything they do is all ready done by another government agency and community health centers. We have 9,000 community health centers. There's no reason one penny ever needs to go to Planned Parenthood… Planned Parenthood is this huge lobby. It gives millions of dollars to Democrats. It uses millions of dollars to fight against Republicans. They are not objective, and they are not telling you the truth. The truth is women's health is taken care of by community health centers by $5,000,000,000. We've doubled the amount of money we put into women's health care through government, and so it's just an absurd argument to say we need Planned Parenthood. It's only about abortion… There are plenty of avenues to go to for women's health care. Planned Parenthood doesn't even do what they say they'll do. They end up referring you to a real doctor or a community health center.

Rep. Steve Scalise, shot last week during a congressional baseball practice, has been upgraded to “serious” condition after the near-death encounter last Wednesday. | Getty McHenry to host blood drive for Scalise
House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Patrick McHenry, Rep. Steve Scalise's right-hand vote counter, will host a Capitol Hill blood drive for his wounded colleague and other victims of last week's shooting, according to a "dear colleague" notice obtained by POLITICO.
The Louisiana Republican, shot last week during a congressional baseball practice, has been upgraded to “serious” condition after the near-death encounter last Wednesday.
Story Continued Below
McHenry (R-N.C.) is close friends with Scalise, the House majority whip, and will host the blood drive in his honor as well as for U.S. Capitol Police special agent Crystal Griner, who was shot in the ankle while taking down the shooter, and lobbyist Matt Mika, who took several bullets to the chest.
The blood drive will take place on Tuesday and Thursday.
Chris Froome and Marcel Kittel clasped their right hands together as the charade began.
As photographers circled a table in a Shanghai hotel conference room and VIPs like Alberto Contador chuckled in the background, the four-time Tour de France champion and the German sprint star engaged in an arm wrestling match.
The odd spectacle, what PR hacks might opportunistically label a photo op, lasted 23 seconds. The Tour champion, who weighs about 45 pounds (20 kg) less than his musclebound opponent, appeared more earnest in his effort, gamely attempting a few parries. Kittel, laughing awkwardly amid the theatrics, withstood these attacks for a while before he flexed his bicep and smashed Froome's hand to the table.
The silly and completely staged moment would soon thereafter be widely shared on with bike racing fans on social media by the ASO — the organization that long has run the Tour de France and now organizes the Shanghai Skoda Criterium. The official Twitter account for Le Tour pushed out video of the bogus competition without irony or shame or even a sense of humor.
Yet this story isn't really about that staged arm wrestling match. It's about a different bogus competition that would take place the following day, one that would be similarly devoid of authentic competition and pushed out to the public without irony or shame or even a sense of humor. And it would be too easy to simply take aim at one counterfeit event, one piece of theater masquerading as a bike race, without acknowledging the unwelcome role such ersatz events have in the bike-racing universe.
Video: Chris Froome and Marcel Kittel arm wrestle in Shanghai, China, October 2017.
Actual race reports document the news that Froome out-sprinted two breakaway companions, Rigoberto Uran and Warren Burguil, to win the inaugural Shanghai Skoda Criterium — an event ASO bills as the 22nd stage of the Tour.
“A victory that tastes more like a gift to the Chinese fans who gathered massively to celebrate the first Tour de France winner to come to China,” ASO's press release read. “Marcel Kittel got the green, Barguil the polka dot and Contador the most aggressive rider award for his last appearance as a pro. Like a symbol.”
Some of the journalistic recaps contain subtle clues to the true nature of the contest, calling the race “largely ceremonial” or “unsurprising.” Photos in such recaps pictured the reigning Tour champion, wearing the yellow jersey from that event, punching the sky as Uran looked to be hanging his head after a narrow loss. To a casual fan, the stories and photographs give the collective impression that a true bike race had taken place.
But after suffering through video of the final 10 kilometers of the Shanghai Criterium, I'm here to tell you that I've seen Santa villages at the local shopping center that had more verisimilitude than that competition.
The pace in the main field was steady and controlled, as if everyone was there on a paid vacation to China slash mandatory work meeting. A break loaded with big names and members of top teams eased off the front. Contador, ostensibly wearing a race number for the last time, got to pedal a few kilometres in the lead, before Froome, looking like he was dragging a few mates on a moderately hard training ride, brought it back together.
What happened next was just awkward and embarrassing to watch. With three kilometers to go, Barguil got out of the saddle and accelerated — I've seen sharper moves at town-line signs — and only Uran and Froome came across. Greg van Avermaet and Edvald Boasson Hagen and Contador tried their best to stick to the script, gamely pretending that they couldn't hold the wheel.
Sunday was not their day — the podium was reserved for the men who had won, finished second, and earned the polka-dot jersey in the marquee race owned by the same company organizing this criterium. Barguil and his polka dots took a ceremonial dig with a kilometer to go before sitting up, and then Froome and Uran exchanged four careful sideways looks in the final 200 meters before they both struck the correct poses for finish-line photography. Kittel and the rest of the main field would roll across the line a minute later. The finale might have looked exciting and satisfying to unsavvy spectators and VIPs at the finish, but it looked awful on video.
Let me be clear — nothing about what transpired at the Shanghai Criterium is surprising or novel. It illuminates a kind of sideshow dramaturgy that has been a part of bike racing since the days of the penny farthing. Many fans understand that the criteriums that take place around Europe after the Tour de France are ceremonial. The Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, the Tour of Flanders, and many legendary races were dreamt up a century ago as publicity stunts to sell newspapers. There's always been an element of the circus within the sport.
But fake bike races don't belong in professional bike racing.
The elemental promise of a bike race is that there will be a competitive field where every participant is trying their best to succeed. Intentionally tampering with that basic premise — that the race is defined by a real battle to win — is extremely dangerous. This is especially true for a sport that has tested even its most passionate fans' resolve with an illogically never-ending race calendar, inequity between the richest teams and everyone else, and a parade of doping scandals.
Look, I understand that the UCI and ASO and other big stakeholders want to grow the sport internationally and tap into important new markets. But pro cycling seems to be going about it wrong.
I see the NFL expanding into Latin America and Europe, for instance, and though those incursions may include silly localized PR stunts, the focus seems to be on building a large audience by delivering authentic competition. With cycling, I instead see the sport just chasing money — more interested in finding benefactors in places like the Middle East and China than on staging real races with great courses and legitimate promise as fan markets. Pro bike racing needs to vigilantly present itself like a real sport in every moment, and resist the urge to pull a page from the pro wrestling handbook.
I look at the finish line photo from Shanghai and can't help but think of the finale of the Olympic road race in London, where Uran had shoulders slumped after getting outfoxed by Alexandr Vinokurov. Even if nothing untoward happened that afternoon, it sure as hell looked hinky — with a man who never really denied buying a win at Liege-Bastogne-Liege out-sprinting someone who took a theatrical look over the wrong shoulder. Even if nothing untoward happened that afternoon, it does not benefit Uran or his sponsors (or his fans) for the Colombian to participate in ceremonial races.
This is obviously not about one rider. Froome — a guy who rightly or wrongly has been accused of winning the wrong way — shouldn't be seen punching the air after triumphing in pre-scripted sitcom on two wheels. The symbolism that Contador's last “race” was that dubious business trip to Shanghai is an insult to his legacy and the effort he gave fans at the Vuelta.
And what about all the young racers who might have great legs in October, guys who had to fly to China and go through the motions without having an opportunity to show their stuff? What about Kittel, whose big win in Shanghai was slamming Froome's fist to a table after 20 seconds of stagecraft?
It's time for the powers that control the sport to end or at least more carefully limit the practice of these staged events, and it's time for cycling media to ignore them or call them out for the farces that they are. These faux races, and the traditions that sustain them, insult the intelligence of fans and degrade an already tarnished sport. Say it with me: No more fake races.

The Richmond Folk Festival, the city's biggest and most popular festival that brings together one of the most diverse and vast musical lineups every year, has announced its initial round of performers for this year's festival.
Check out the following scheduled acts for the festival which takes place October 7-9:
Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino
Southern Italian pizzica tarantata
Salento, Italy
Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino (CGS), a seven-member ensemble from the Salento peninsula of Apulia, led this revival of interest in the music and dance of Salento. In the process, the group became the biggest stars of Italian traditional music.
The Fairfield Four
African-American gospel quartet singing
Nashville, Tennessee
African-American a cappella gospel quartet which was organized in 1921. The gospel quartet tradition has its roots in the Negro spirituals of the American South. Enslaved Africans combined English hymns with West African rhythms and singing to create a musical form that expressed both Christian devotion and the desire for freedom.
Gary U.S. Bonds with Gene “Daddy G” Barge
The Norfolk Sound
Norfolk, Virginia, by way of Long Island & Chicago
Bonds is an American rhythm and blues and rock and roll singer and Barge is an American tenor and alto saxophonist.
Geno Delafose & French Rockin' Boogie

Homayoun Sakhi & Salar Nader
Afghan rubâb and tabla
San Francisco Bay Area, California
The evocative music of Homayoun Sakhi and Salar Nader tells a story of hope and perseverance, both of the Afghan people and of their traditional music. Afghan traditional music is a hybrid that reflects the country's position at the confluence of Persian, Central Asian, and Indian cultures. The national instrument is the rubâb, a double-chambered, fretted lute.
Jason D. Williams
rockabilly
Memphis, Tennessee
Williams started playing piano at age two, and at 16 quit high school to join rockabilly legend Sleepy LaBeef's band on the road. From LaBeef he learned hundreds of songs from blues, gospel, country, R&B, and beyond, and how they could be transmuted into revved-up rockabilly.
Joe Mullins & the Radio Ramblers
bluegrass
Xenia, Ohio
Joe Mullins has built a life on “banjo picking and broadcasting” and that's why the bluegrass band he leads is called the Radio Ramblers.
Marquise Knox
blues
St. Louis, Missouri
Born and raised in St. Louis with family roots in Grenada, Mississippi, Marquise burst onto the blues scene at the age of 16, astonishing veteran bluesmen and audiences alike with performances that evidenced a musical spirit and understanding well beyond his age. Marquise now commands the stage with a presence befitting his mentors, these days adding harmonica to his imposing vocals and accomplished guitar playing—a rising star channeling the spirit and soulfulness of old-school blues masters.
Natalie MacMaster & Donnell Leahy
Cape Breton and Ontario fiddling
Nova Scotia and Ontario, Canada
Award winning Cape Breton musician, Natalie MacMaster, began her fiddling career at 16 releasing her debut album Four on the Floor. Her musical venture now spans over three decades, completing 11 albums, performing thousands of shows and collaborating with a multitude of world-renowned artists.
Sheila Kay Adams
Appalachian songs, stories, and ballads
Marshall, North Carolina
Seventh-generation ballad singer, storyteller, and musician Sheila Kay Adams is a national treasure. She performs the old mountain ballads, stories, and songs with a sense of conviction, honesty, and dignity that reveals a deep respect for tradition, and demonstrates the emotional intensity of the unadorned human voice.
Sri Lankan Dance Academy of NY
traditional Sri Lankan dance
Staten Island, New York
n recent years, the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island has earned the moniker “Little Sri Lanka,” in honor of the vibrant immigrant community that has developed in this New York City borough since the first Sri Lankan family arrived in the late 1960s. Now numbering about 5,000 people, this is believed to be the largest Sri Lankan enclave in the United States, receiving enthusiastic notice for introducing American audiences to traditional Kandyan dance through the work of the Sri Lankan Dance Academy of NY.
Stay tuned for more lineup announcements and details on the festival.
"Death of a Nation." D'Souza Media While moviegoers often flock to bad movies in large numbers (see: 2018's "The Nun" and "Fifty Shades Freed"), professional film critics will tend to pile condemnation on those same films.
To find out which movies film critics have collectively hated the most, we turned to the reviews aggregator Metacritic to compile this list of the most critically panned movies in history.
From ill-advised sequels like "Scary Movie 5" and "Caddyshack II," to two dubious political documentaries by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, these films drew the ire of critics and provoked the repulsion of many.
Here are the 75 worst movies of all time, according to critics:
Note: Only movies with seven or more online reviews appear in the ranking, so it skews toward more recent films.
TOKYO — Japan moved closer to reviving part of its moribund nuclear power industry on Friday, as a regional government agreed to restart two reactors at a plant that is among a dozen nationwide waiting to be switched back on following the Fukushima disaster three and a half years ago.
The decision by the authorities in Kagoshima Prefecture, on the southern island of Kyushu, cleared an important obstacle to restarting the reactors, which were declared safe by Japan's new nuclear regulatory agency in September but have been awaiting the go-ahead from politicians.
Japan's 48 operable commercial reactors have been caught in a seesawing debate over safety since the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in March 2011, and none are currently producing power. The two reactors in Kagoshima, at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, would be the first to be brought back online under safety standards introduced last year.
A restart at Sendai would smooth the way for others around the country. Electric utilities are seeking safety certifications for 20 reactors at 13 plants, less than half the number that were in operation before Fukushima. Others are considered too old to upgrade, or are too close to the disaster zone, in the country's northeast, to be politically acceptable. Tens of thousands of Fukushima residents remain unable to return home.
It's the difficulty levels. That's what I love most about Thief. Looking Glass's genre-exploding first-person sneaker epic is an incredible work for many reasons, but I think it's best summarised by the difficulty levels.
Garrett, a master thief, works independently of the three societal groups that populate the game's expansive city. He's a loner, trained by the Keepers, but has long since abandoned them to pursue his own interests. Your first adventure is to break into Lord Bafford's Manor to steal his jewelled sceptre. But here's the thing: On the Normal setting you're charged with successfully breaking into the building and finding the sceptre. Hard raises the stakes in more predictable ways such as having to escape the manor once the prize is stolen, and asking you to loot 350 gold pieces worth of items while you're there. But it's the final requirement that's significant. "Don't kill any of the servants; they're harmless." Bring it up to Expert and now you're tasked with getting 700 gold, but also: "Don't kill anyone while you do the job. No servants, no guards, no pets... no one." It's this that captures the spirit, the essence of this most extraordinary game. This is a game where turning the difficulty up reduces the number of enemies you have to kill. Certainly it also increases the number of guards (but slightly and smartly, never feeling unfair or unrealistic), and repositions them into more strategic patrol routes. But it doesn't make your weapons less effective, or raise enemy hit-points, or artificially hinder you in any 'gamey' way. It simply asks you to be a better, subtler, smarter thief. This particular phrase from one Expert mission briefing says it all perfectly: "Violence is the mark of the amateur. Don't kill anyone."
Out of darkness A giant pile of bodies. It'd be fun to be around when they all woke up from their snooze. Well, actually, what I love most about Thief is the darkness. I love making the room dark before I play. Lots of games have that gamma check at the beginning, asking you to make sure the logo is barely visible in the box or whichever, but it's rarely of much importance. With Thief you tape the curtains to the window frames and stuff socks in the crack under the door. I love entering a heavily guarded location, crouching in a safely shadowed corner, then snuffing the wall-mounted torches with a couple of water arrows. In the darkness I make quick methodical work of the patrolling guards, thwacking them over the back of the head with my trusted blackjack, and quickly depositing their unconscious bodies in a secluded, neat pile. Then having the safe run of the place, robbing every chest, shelf and hidden lockbox. The use of lighting was remarkable in 1998, and still feels special 11 years later. Finding a shadow, watching your light meter fade to that comforting dark green, and waiting for your victim to stroll past - it's a feeling of incredible power, but power without armoured rifles or rocket launchers. Needing to pass through a room lit by non-extinguishable lamps, powered by this steampunk Middle Ages' mysterious magic, creates a sensation of helplessness, the nearest dreary corner looking homely and welcoming. The more you play, the more you crave the darkness, until you find yourself flinching when walking into your fluorescently lit kitchen, or instinctively picking the darkest path when walking home in the evening.
Rugged gaming This is how the game really looks most of the time. Nowhere will ever print a realistic screenshot of a Thief game, because it's all but pitch black. But Eurogamer is brave enough. And damn right. But of course it's the carpets I love most about Thief. After the light, the second most important aesthetic character in the game is the floor. Of how many games could you write that sentence? You're always acutely aware of what you're standing on. Tiled, stone floors make up most of the streets and buildings you encounter, loudly registering your clip-clop footsteps. (It does seem that if Garrett really wanted to be a master thief, he might consider not wearing the high-heel shoes that can only be responsible for the ludicrous noise he makes while running.) Exaggerated it might be, but it allows you to register exactly how much of a racket you're making. Crouched down, inching forward, disguising your footsteps can be astonishingly difficult. And then you spot the worst sights of them all: gravel or ceramic tiles. Each makes such a noise, and if you're out of moss arrows to soften your step, drastic long-cuts may need to be taken. But then, there it is: carpet. Sweet, blessed carpet. On carpet Garrett can run, jump and be merry, producing nothing more than a soft scuffing. Sneaking up on the enemy is a cinch, picking their pockets and being long gone before they've a clue you were ever there. Oh, heavens, a completely dark carpeted room: sheer bliss.

I literally don't understand this. Maybe it's because I never used かかわる before, but I have no clue what you're trying to say after even looking that up. You're being concerned with something to someone?
What is this? Are you trying to apologise for having bad Japanese grammar? This sentence is terrible if you want to do that because first of all you're ending it as 詫び and not 詫びる, and secondly, you should read it again because 詫びる is an intransitive verb. You cannot use WO with an intransitive verb because those verbs by definition do not take direct objects. Even if it did, you're literally saying that something "Apologises my Japanese (language)". A better way for this is 私の分かりにくい日本語申し訳ございません
This sentence seems to me like you're saying you cannot very well speak japanese. But again, you just said that. This is redundant. I would say また、日本語でペラペラできない.
I would remove 私は here since we know you're talking about you since you literally just introduced yourself but I'll let it slide because it's the beginning of something new and it makes sense with 受け取ったことの通知を受けています。I don't feel it's very wrong but I would move 私は to after 受け取ったことの通知 because after such a long phrase it's kind of hard imo to tell who did what now.
I know you're trying to say "The problem video" but please change it to something like you said earler: 著作権ストライクを受け取ったビデオ. Saying 問題のビデオ sounds like something I would say in my second month of learning Japanese.
I have a bad feeling about this. I'd rather say that <Title of video>があった or が存在した or something I can't think of a proper word to indicate it was there rather than playing the video.
Remove saying this from your speech entirely. The 私は is completely redundant and saying 考えると alone also makes me feel bad. I'd probably add something behind it like 動画が消されたのを考えたら or something. Also I'd use -たら instead of と here because it's a feeling. I know they'd both mean when here, but と feels to me like the kind of when you use when you say "When I drop this ball, it will fall" etc.
I don't like がきた here. I looked it up and it's not a suru verb so maybe you can say がした instead.
Just say copyrighted song and not 問題の曲
私は
WILL YOU FUCKING STOP SAYING THIS
な
i don't know what this means but I have never used 一部 before so who knows
I think you should indicate that it's this copyright strike that is giving you a 影響 here with blah blah blah ga after キャリアに
I think you're using a dictionary for this exact word apparently meaning "very"
I don't think the ideas come together here. The copyright strike that very much put your channel in disorder just終わる? What's going on? It's ending? You want them to end it? You're going to end such things in the future? I have no clue.
FINALLY YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED REALLY GOOD. USE をお願いします LIKE THIS MORE
私は
So wait, why do you need them to delete the strike for you to delete the video?
What does this mean? I'm only used to 移動 being used like going to another country
作業 isn't "Work with me here." type of work. It's literally 仕事すること
より is better than から
We were as astonished as you probably are right now when we first got to know about it. Sure, the government was talking with the concerned officials, but not in our wildest dreams did we think that it would be initiated so quickly. In a shock release that hit our inboxes today, we got to learn that Hyperloop is indeed coming here to the land of anemic 40 kph trains. HTT or Hyperloop Transportation Technologies will launch India's first Hyperloop connecting Amravati and Vijayawada. HTT has signed a historic Agreement with the Government of the Andhra Pradeshto connect the city centers of the two cities.
The MoU marks the first agreement in India for the new transportation system, and will turn a trip of over one hour into a 5-minute ride. In addition to the transformation it will bring to public transport, the Public Private Partnership (PPP) with funding primarily from private investors is expected to create over 2,500 jobs.
During Phase 1 of the project, HTT will conduct a six-month feasibility study commencing in October. Working with partners in the public and private sector, HTT will analyze the surrounding cityscapes to create the best route between the two cities while identifying all pertinent stakeholders in the region. After conducting the initial six-month feasibility study, Phase 2 of the project will construct and build HTT's first Hyperloop in India.
The State of Andhra Pradesh is the seventh largest in India with a population of over 50 million people. Connecting these emerging development regions with ultra-high-speed transportation will establish this region as a leader in technological innovation and sustainable development.
The APEDB along with Government of Andhra Pradesh will assist Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. (HTT) with all regulatory requirements and develop and implement hyperloop in Amravati.
“We are extremely delighted to have entered into a MoU with the Government of Andhra Pradesh to bring the HTT Hyperloop to India,” said Mr. Bibop Gresta, Chairman & Co-founder, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies. “In partnering with Andhra Pradesh, HTT will work with local stakeholders to build the regulatory standards necessary for safe and efficient operation.”
Mr. Krishna Kishore, Chief Executive Officer, Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board said, “Major cities of the world has seen declines in livability and transportation has been a major contributor due to congestion, air pollution and accessibility and Andhra Pradesh is shaping the way it approaches transportation in the future. By collaborating with Hyperloop, Amravati is embracing a prototype for the mobility of tomorrow” he added.
Aviruk Chakraborty, advisor to the Economic Development Board, says, “Climate change is an inevitable reality, human race has to embrace technology that will stabilize green house. India has ratified the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol that commits countries to contain the emission of greenhouse gases, reaffirming its stand on climate action. The step towards implementing the Hyperloop is India's commitment to Kyoto Protocol. India is entering into a new era in terms of technology and our goal is to put India on the global map by developing and implementing green technologies, the first Hyperloop in Amravati.”
Michelle Duggar turned 49 on Sunday and in honor her birthday several of her 19 offspring complimented her parenting skills and offered her their best wishes. In videos posted to the Duggar Family's official blog, Jessa Seewald and Jana Duggar revealed they both aspire to be like their mother and former “19 Kids and Counting” co-star.
“So grateful for you. You're my hero in life,” Michelle's eldest daughter, Jana Duggar, 25, said in a video clip. Jana Duggar, who was recently rumored to be going to a Christian college and courting former NFL star Tim Tebow, says she hopes to become just like her mother. “I just hope to be like you someday,” she adds.
Jessa Seewald, Michelle Duggar's fifth born, also shared a few special words with her mom. The 22-year-old former reality star, who is due to welcome her first child Nov. 1, says she plans to implement parenting skills used by her mom in her own child's life.
“Two things that really stand out to me about the way you parent is, for one, your patience. You're very patient with the kids and even whenever they're acting up or doing something wrong you're very calm in how you handle it,” she said. “And then, also, just your love for Jesus. I think that's something that's really stood out to me ... Anytime things are going crazy, you're always just pointing us to Jesus. I know that's your rock in tough times. I love you so much and I look up to you.”
This isn't the first time Jessa Seewald has praised her mother's child-rearing skills. In May, in honor of Mother's Day 2015, she took to her blog to share a special message with Michelle Duggar. “As I think about the years growing up and just all the things you did for us kids, all the sacrifices you made for us over the years … just your love and your patience in raising us. I'm just so inspired. I'm really encouraged as I'm celebrating my first Mother's Day this year to just look to your example.”
Michelle Duggar's husband, Jim Bob Duggar, who shared his kids' videos on the family's Facebook page Sunday, also had a few sweet words for his wife. “Happy birthday, Michelle – a fantastic wife and a wonderful Mother! We love you more than we can ever put into words!” he wrote. “Your love, wisdom and grace are a treasure to us!"

Marilyn Manson is known for his pale makeup and often outrageous image - but he went for a more low-key style as he joined Johnny Depp on stage this week.
The Beautiful People star was the special guest of The Hollywood Vampires as they took to the stage at Stella McCartney 's 2016 Fall Presentation party on Tuesday night.
Although he did have dark makeup around his eyes - would anyone expect any less? - the goth rocker otherwise appeared makeup free as he showed a hint of stubble.

He fit in with the stylish image for the performance, wearing a wide-brimmed hat with a red detail and a long black coat as he joined the group and provided vocals.

While accepting the Desert Palm Achievement Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, he said: "I also have to thank my wife Amber for putting up with me, for living with all these characters, which can't be easy.
"It's hard for me - it's got to be hard for her."
Johnny has previously admitted he feels so "lucky" to connect with Amber on "a lot of levels."

Although political contests in general, and Labour contests in particular, are bound to be divisive, the impending Scottish Labour leadership one has so far seen little acrimony. Eric Shaw provides an overview of the two candidates and concludes that neither of them is by nature confrontational, while both recognise than in order to regain Labour's leading role in Scotland, a huge amount of work has to be done.
Kezia Dugdale's surprise resignation as leader of the Scottish Labour party has created a vacancy that already, in less than two decades, eight people have occupied. There are two contenders, Anas Sarwar and Richard Leonard.
The rise of 34 years of age, privately-educated Glasgow MSP Anas Sarwar, a dentist by profession, has been swift though not entirely smooth. He won the Westminster Glasgow Central seat generously vacated by his father Mohammad in 2010 but lost it in the 2015 wipe-out. He was elected to the Scottish Parliament two years later and is at present Health frontbencher. He is on the party's right and has in the past been critical of the Corbyn leadership. In his recently published diary, the left-wing MSP Neil Findlay described him as ‘well-mannered, ambitious and extremely well connected.' He was an obvious contender for the leadership
Richard Leonard, the 55-year-old son of textile workers, was born in Yorkshire and, like Sarwar, was privately-educated (on a scholarship). He was employed as an economist for the Scottish TUC and then served for 20 years as a GMB official before being elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2015. He is the party's spokesman on the economy. Whilst unfamiliar to most Scots he is a longstanding and seasoned figure in Scottish Labour politics and a member of its Executive Committee for 20 years. He chaired the stormy and tumultuous Scottish party conference in spring 2003 (it coincided with the Iraq war) with very considerable aplomb. As the GMB's Political Officer he has been closely involved in Labour policy-making for years. To this extent (and unlike Jeremy Corbyn) he is no outsider.
A steadfast left-winger, Leonard warmly praised Corbyn for his ‘authentic and principled politics' and criticised those who sought to undermine his leadership. Shrewd and adept, he is highly regarded by GMB officials who worked with him over the years and is viewed as a skilled negotiator and an astute operator. A conciliator by nature as leader he is likely to opt for an inclusive and consensual managerial style.
Sarwar has been somewhat slow in communicating his view of Labour's future. Leonard's position has been more clear-cut and signals something of a break with previous leaders. For him, Labour's chief priority should be challenging existing stark inequalities in the distribution of wealth, power, and life-chance rather than pondering the intricacies of Scotland's constitutional future. Shared class interests and aspirations between the mass of the British population, he contends, transcend any narrow differences over nationality. A prime strategic object for the party should be to expose the hollowness of much of the SNP's radical rhetoric, and Leonard has been adamant that under his leadership there would be no pacts or deals with the SNP, no second independence referendum, and ‘no ground ceded to nationalism at the expense of progressive socialism'.
One matter, sadly, cannot be completely dismissed. Though he has lived in Scotland for all his adult life and affirms that ‘I belong to Scotland', some more narrow-minded voters might query whether an Englishman should be a Scottish First Minister. It's not an issue for Labour's selectorate but it might be for the wider electorate.
Initially Sarwar appeared to hold the upper hand. He was well-known in the party, an accomplished TV performer, polished, tactful, and affable. It had been widely assumed that Sarwar has been planning a leadership bid for a while and he would have a slick and professional operation in place. But apparently not, for his campaign soon stumbled over damaging revelations about the family firm, United Wholesale Scotland, in which he owns a large stake. It transpired that, not only was there no recognised trade union but the firm was paying almost £1 less than the living wage for some of its workforce: highly embarrassing facts for a senior Labour politician. Sarwar's own supporters were baffled why this had not been anticipated and, although Sarwar soon agreed to dispose of his stake, the story was widely publicised and the damage was inflicted.
Another factor that, at first glance, seemed to favour Sarwar was the the balance of opinion within the membership. A significantly lower proportion had backed Corbyn in the most recent leadership election and there were far fewer new recruits than south of the border.
But much depends on the actual selectorate. In Corbyn's second election there was a huge controversy over the NEC's decision that no one could vote unless they had been a member for six months, excluding a large swathe of largely Corbynista recruits. The SEC, in contrast, has stipulated that anyone who joined as member, affiliated supporter (i.e. signed-up political levy payer in an affiliated trade union) or registered supporters by 9 October would be eligible to vote. In other words, candidates were given a month to recruit fresh members.
This played to Leonard's strengths as he knew he could rely on both the left-wing Campaign for Socialism, closely linked to the Momentum organisation, and the bulk of the affiliated unions to work energetically to recruit sympathetic new members. The Huffington Post recently reported that Unite, the UK's biggest union, has already signed up 2,700 affiliated supporters to add to the 5,000 it already has. This forms a large proportion of the estimated over 20,000 members and registered supporters plus a roughly-estimated 10,000 affiliated members who compose Scottish Labour's selectorate.
Although any contest for the leadership is bound, to some degree, to be divisive so far there has been little of the acrimony or invective which has recently typified Labour politics. Neither candidate is by nature confrontational and whoever is elected – most probably Leonard – will try hard to mend wounds understanding that if the party is to regain its leading role in Scottish politics a huge amount of work has to be done.

This is my first post in a series that will detail my progress in implementing an end-to-end open-source configuration-defined Telecom Operator. The Operator will be designed to be all the features and functions, both internally and externally, in a unified and completely abstracted service model. I named the result the "Telecom as the Middleware Stack" as a form of expressing that it becomes the service it provides and is reduced to a consumer of everything and anything that it can communicate as an adaptive version of one overall amazing experience.
Imagine a tablet that, depending on who's holding it, adapts its purpose. In one person's hand it's an enterprise's CRM experience; in someone else's hand its an IPTV set-top-box; another's: a portal to live cameras; and another's: the live network map of fiber and copper in the ground within 10 feet of where their standing. Imagine that tablet is simply an interface that can be anything, to anyone, simply based on authentication, authorization, policy, and governance; a completely adaptive experience delivered all by a single device.
We can imagine that quite easily because the tablet has evolved to be just that: an adaptive blank slate. Now image that same experience with every digital service, every electronic device, in every conceivable layer of service delivery, and for every desired experience that a Telecom Operator could provide, all from a single Service Provider: that is the promise of the integration of NFV, SDN, IoT, and the Telecom as the Middleware Stack approach. That is what I want to outline and explore in this series.
The goal of the journey of this series is to:
Reduce Telecom Operator costs associated with closed, legacy, and/or proprietary IT. Increase productivity through experience architecting the multi-tenant, multi-purpose usability. Entrench technology-agility, real-time intelligence, and market-viability. Mitigate risk of vendor, technology, or strategy lock-in. "Open" every door for innovation from internal and external perspectives.
The strategy to obtain that goal is to:
Develop and expose the entire TMForum process-standards, application-frameworks, and API reference-models into centralized Governance Model, Multi-Tenant/Purpose Policy Engine, and API Manager. Abstract and integrate the wiring-harnesses of network function virutalization (NFV), software defined networking (SDN), and internet-of-things (IoT). Utilize WSO2's unified product stack to implement as much of the integration, governance, policy enforcement, complex event processing, and user experience as possible, but no more than that. Decoupling of systems from user experience and marrying them back adaptively via policy. Introduce "open-source" principals to the experience architecting aspect.
The intended result is:
All dresses cost $85 and there are currently five styles
'We're not trying to be gaudy or draw attention to ourselves, but we want to wear the best that we have,' she said of her dresses
She has now returned to fashion at the age of 26 with her company Q. Noor, which makes a line of temple dresses
When she was 18 she was sent to Japan and something happened which compromised her values, so she left the industry
but as a devout Mormon would not work Sundays and read her scriptures everyday
A Mormon model who spent two years walking runways around the world as a teenager is back home in Salt Lake City and beginning a new endeavor.
Rosemary Card was just 16-years-old when she moved to New York City to start her modelling career after signing a three-year contract with Elite, but by the time she was 18 she was finished with the business.
Card did not want to compromise her values or do anything she might later regret, but know she has found a way to combine both her love for fashion and her faith with a line of Mormon temple dresses.

Chic: A former runway model has launched a new clothing Q. Noor, which makes Mormon temple dresses (above)
Living the life: Rosemary Card (above in 2015) moved to New York City when she was just 16 after signing a three-year contract with Elite Model Management, but left after a few years
'When people say, "Why did you stop modeling?" I always say, "Long story short is I feel like I'm able to offer more to this world,"' Card told the Deseret News.
Card, who is one of five children, was first noticed when she took a role as an extra in the first installment of the the hugely-popular Disney trilogy High School Musical.
It was on that set that someone told her she should be a model, and so on a trip to New York City with her mother she attended some open calls, getting a contract almost immediately with Elite Model Management.
With her career as a model becoming a reality now, her parents had some major concerns with how this might clash with their daughter's faith.
'They prayed about it and fasted about it, and they really felt like it was part of God's plan for me,' said Card.
'So even though it wasn't part of their plan, they didn't feel like they could say to Heavenly Father, "Oh, it's not in our plan. We're not going to do it." But they felt like I was supposed to do it, and I think that gave them a lot of peace.'
Card also got some advice from a fellow Mormon who had also been a model, Leanne Freedman, who told her; 'You just take one inappropriate picture, and you will never get it back.'
Nice price: All Q. Noor dresses cost $85 and there are currently five styles
Once in New York Card, then 16, spoke with her agency who allowed her Sundays off to attend church and things seemed to be going well until she traveled to Japan two years later.
Card does not explain what happened exactly, just that her standard were compromised and so she returned to Utah.
She went to school at Brigham Young, graduating in 2013, and started a photography business.
And now, eight years later, she is back in the fashion business, though this time on the other side as a designer making temple dresses.
'I know the purpose of the temple is not to be hot or to be flashy,' said Card.
'We're not trying to be gaudy or draw attention to ourselves, but we want to wear the best that we have, and if the temple is the most important work on this Earth, we should be dressed our very best for it.
'I don't think it has to be extreme, but I just want people to look nice.'
The company, Q.Noor, launched in November, and is already successful according to Card.
On the website Card writes; 'We believe there is a reason why temples are beautiful, and we think your dress should be too. You will love your Q.Noor temple dress for its beauty and comfort so much so that you can forget about what you're wearing and focus on what is most important.'
She then adds; 'Whether 2016 has wedding bells or door-bells in store for you, find your perfect temple dress in our shop.'
All dresses are $85, and currently come in five styles, all simple, white and conservative in accordance with temple standards.
EDMONTON—Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr has been denied unsupervised visits with his controversial older sister who has expressed support for Al Qaeda. Justice June Ross ruled Friday that Khadr and his lawyer, Nathan Whitling, have offered nothing new to allay security concerns surrounding Zaynab Khadr, who is currently believed to be in Sudan.
Zaynab Khadr, 37, has spoken in favour of Al Qaeda and was investigated in Canada more than a decade ago for helping the terrorist network, but she was never charged. She is reportedly planning a trip to Canada, and the rules of Khadr's bail allow him to meet with her but only in the presence of his bail supervisor or one of his lawyers. Whitling argued in Court of Queen's Bench that the restriction is no longer necessary. He said Khadr, 30, is old enough and mature enough not to be swayed by anyone else.

“The passage of time makes a big difference,” Whitling told Ross as Khadr sat behind him in the public gallery Friday. “The idea that someone's sister will turn him into a different person is no longer a concern.” He noted that Zaynab “may have made some unfortunate media statements” but there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Bruce Hughson, a lawyer representing the federal government, told Ross that Khadr has provided no new evidence on Zaynab Khadr's terrorism views that would justify changing the bail rules.

$134-million claim against Khadr is based on false information and should be thrown out, lawyer argues Ross agreed. She said the restriction was put in place for a reason and Whitling needs to show evidence — besides the passage of time — to justify amending the order.

“The defence has not provided relevant evidence to show a change of circumstances,” Ross said. Outside court, Whitling said that would require an affidavit from Zaynab Khadr who is out of the country. “It's a possibility I suppose,” he said.
Khadr is on bail while he appeals war crime convictions by a U.S. military commission. He declined to make any comment outside court. Whitling said his client was disappointed. “He does want to be able to contact his sister and he doesn't see how he'll be able to speak to his nieces and nephews without having some sort of supervisor present.” Toronto-born Khadr spent years in U.S. detention at Guantanamo Bay after he was caught when he was 15 and accused of tossing a grenade that killed special forces soldier Christopher Speer at a militant compound in Afghanistan in 2002. In 2010, Khadr pleaded guilty to multiple charges before the military commission, including to killing Speer, but has since said he can't remember if he tossed the grenade. He has said he entered the plea to try to get out of Guantanamo, where he says he was mistreated, and into the Canadian justice system. He is now married and is moving to Red Deer, south of Edmonton, to begin earning a nursing degree. While awaiting his appeal hearing, Khadr has sought a loosening of a number of bail restrictions. Ross did allow a change to Khadr's internet use. He had been restricted to personal internet devices and subject to checks. Whitling argued that the internet is available everywhere on multiple devices — at friends' homes and in public places — and that there is no way for Khadr to avoid it. Ross agreed to expand Khadr's internet use as long as he doesn't use the web to seek out terrorist propaganda or organizations.
Former Guantanamo Bay inmate Omar Khadr says in July he hopes a settlement reached with the federal government ? reportedly for $10.5 million ? won?t ?cause people pain.? The Liberals also apologized to Khadr in settling a lawsuit over violations of his rights. (The Canadian Press)P
Khadr also needs permission to travel outside Alberta. Whitling said Khadr has made multiple trips to Ontario to visit family without incident and should only have to notify authorities when travelling outside his home province. Ross denied that request. She said the current approach seems to be working fine without undue hardship to Khadr. His 15-year-old case ignited sharp and divisive debate among Canadians over terrorism, human rights and the rule of law this summer when it was revealed the federal government had settled a lawsuit filed by him for a reported $10.5 million. The payout followed a ruling by Canada's Supreme Court in 2010 that Khadr's charter rights were violated at Guantanamo and that Canadian officials contributed to that violation.

On this Thursday, June 19, 2008, file photo, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush answers questions at the Excellence in Action conference, a national summit on education reform, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Jeb Bush poised for Florida Senate run
As Caroline Kennedy pursues her bright-lights, big-city bid for the U.S. Senate, another child of dynasty is quietly testing the waters for his own Senate run.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush — the son of one president and the brother of another — has been working the phones since Sen. Mel Martinez (R-Fla.) announced earlier this month that he won't seek reelection in 2010. Sources say Bush hasn't made up his mind about running for Martinez' seat, but that he's getting green lights from would-be contributors and blessings from Republican Party leaders.
Story Continued Below
Strategists and political observers take it as a sign that Bush will run.
"Everything indicates that he's in," said David Johnson, a Republican strategist and the CEO of Strategic Vision. "You're not making calls and laying the ground work for fundraising unless you're clearing the field for your candidacy."
Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida and an expert on Florida politics, said Bush's phone calls around the state are "a good sign" that he could be jumping in the race, something that she says is "music to the ears of Florida Republicans."
"Nothing could have come at a better time," MacManus said. "Republicans here in Florida were so down after the election. The mere mention of Jeb's potential Senate run has put Republicans in a much more festive holiday mood."
Still, those who know Jeb Bush best say there's just no telling what he'll decide.
"I would be more surprised if he did run than if he didn't," said Republican state Sen. Michael Bennett. "And I know that's surprising considering he would be walking away from a surefire win and a seat in the U.S. Senate. I don't know of many people who would walk away from that.”
Bennett said that the legislative process has never appealed to Bush.
"Jeb wants to be king. He doesn't want to be a prince,” he said. “He's used to getting things done and getting things done now. He's not one to wait for the process."
"Left to his own druthers, he'd want to take a pass," adds Al Cardenas, a close friend and the former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. "He's torn between the benefits of public service retirement and the lure of jumping back into the fray when our party really needs it."
Although Bush's older brother will leave the White House next month with approval ratings around 30 percent, sources say that the former Florida governor is hearing from GOP leaders that the Bush family name won't be a barrier if he decides to enter the race.
"Quite the opposite, actually," said one source close to Jeb Bush. "What he's found is that everyone is encouraging him to run. It's actually been a little overwhelming."

CALAIS, Maine — Kayla Garriott of Robbinston, a victim of childhood sexual abuse by her biological father, has turned adversity into action. She has created a grassroots organization, Breathe the A.I.R. (abuse, incest, rape) to break the silence surrounding these issues and is hosting her first fundraiser on Aug. 27.
“I am a survivor of sexual abuse, incest, and rape,” 22-year-old Garriott said in a recent email. “My abuser is my biological father and it happened from the time I was 10 until I was 17. After we went through a trial and he was prosecuted, I decided to start my own nonprofit organization called Breathe the A.I.R.”
”Our mission to victims and survivors of sexual abuse, incest and rape is to provide the support they need,” Garriott's website states. “We aim to provide victims and survivors a place to learn the stories of others and know that they are not alone. We will also provide them with education on how to stop it, how to keep it from defining who they are, and what they can do about it.”
“We will also provide victims and survivors with a better informed public,” she said.
Garriott endured over seven years of abuse from her father before she found the courage to speak out. Since she has found her voice she has been doing everything she can to let it fly.
Garriott was 10 years old when the abuse started, she said. She was manipulated, controlled, drugged and abused by her biological father up until her senior year of high school.
During this time Garriott did not speak up but wrote of her pain and confusion on scraps of paper in a notebook which was eventually found by her mother. The police were contacted and Garriott's father was eventually convicted of his sex crimes and sent to prison for 12 years.
In the wake of the trial, Garriott said she was determined to help give other victims a voice.
She is now attending Quinnipiac College in Connecticut and, as a certified domestic violence counselor, addresses high school students, college students and police recruits on issues of incest, abuse and rape.
Garriott is holding her first fundraiser, Riding For A Voice, on Saturday, Aug. 27. People are urged to ride two-, three- or four-wheeled transportation along a roughly 90-mile route with other participants to make noise, help publicize Garriott's organization and alert the public to the issue.
“What I hope is to raise awareness about the crime that so many consider a family problem when in reality it is a crime,” Garriott said. “With the money raised I hope to launch an educational campaign for local schools and law enforcement centers on how to understand and deal with this crime.”
Last week, the Calais City Council declared Saturday, Aug. 27, Riding For a Voice Day.
The event will begin at Karen's Main Street Diner in Calais, travel to Cohill's Inn in Lubec and wind up at the Eastport Chowder House for a Biker Bash Barbecue where there will be food, music and prizes.
Entry fees are $35 per couple or $20 per single for those on motorcycles, and $20 per person for cars, bicycles or other vehicles. Registration will be from 8:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. Participants will receive an event T-shirt and will be entered to win other prizes.

Update – AMD has asked us to remove this content piece due to their NDA regarding the Hawaii GPU. The article and its content would go live once the NDA is over or the product has officially been launched and announced by AMD.
The block diagram of AMD's next generation Radeon R9 290 series ‘Hawaii GPU' has been. Only recently did we have a chance to detail the full technical specifications of the Radeon R9 290 series unfortunately we had to take the article down due to our NDA with AMD but now we get to look at the integral architecture changes the Hawaii chip features over its predecessor Tahiti.
AMD Radeon R9 290 ‘Hawaii' GPU Block Diagram Detailed
The Radeon R9 290X and Radeon R9 290 would both feature the Hawaii GPU architecture. The Hawaii chip measures at a 438mm2 which is larger 24% larger compared to the Tahiti chip which measures at 389mm2. AMD spent alot of time tweaking and organizing their Hawaii chip since that was the only chip they have been actively developing since the launch of the last HD 7000 series cards which was a long time ago hence we are looking at a complete departure from the older GCN 1.0 design in the GCN 2.0 Hawaii architecture.
The Hawaii block diagram shows that the core consists of eight ACE ‘Asynchronous Compute Engines' modules which is twice the amount featured on Tahiti, right in the middle of these modules is the main graphics command processor to allow global data share. The Hawaii GPU consists of four Shader Engines each with its own parallel linked geometry processors and Rasterizers, each Shader Engine hold 11 Compute units with 64 Stream processor count, the full Radeon R9 290X Hawaii GPU comes with 44 Compute units and a shader count of 2816 streaming processors, 176 Texture mapping units and 64 Raster operator units.
All Shader engines share the same pool of 16 64 KB L2 Cache with upto 1 TB/s L2/L1 bandwidth. The Hawaii GPU has eight 64-bit MCs or memory controllers which result in the 512-bit bus interface with an abundant 4 GB GDDR5 memory.
Multimedia processors are featured along side the main GEs that include VCE, UVD, DSPs for TrueAudio, XDMA, Eyefinity Controllers and the DMA engine. Last of all, a small PCI-e 3.0 Bus interface is located which enables support with the latest PCI-e 3.0 enabled motherboards.
A GCN 2.0 architecture efficiency slide shows the main improvements between Tahiti and Hawaii and we can note that the geometry processing rate has been increased by 1.9 times with 4 Billion primitives per second on Hawaii compared to 2.1 Billion on its predecessor. Similarly the texture and pixel fill rate have been upped by 30 and 90 percent respectively while the bandwidth is rated at 320 GB/s compared to 264 GB/s on the HD 7970. Lastly, on to compute side users would get 12.8 peak GLops/mm2 compared to 12.2 on Tahiti. The Hawaii Radeon R9 290 series has a larger die size of 438mm2 so we are expecting upto 5.6 TFlops of compute performance. AMD's Hawaii Radeon R9 290 series launches next week, stay tuned for more info.

This LEGO water sensory bin for kids is a great way to work on fine motor skills. You probably already have everything on hand to make this LEGO sensory soup.
Sensory soups have been a favorite in our house for quite some time. What I love about sensory soups is that they are super simple to set up, encourage fine motor skills, and end up engaging the boys in hours of quiet sensory play. They're a perfect sensory bin for kids of all ages!
Plus, sensory soup bins are ridiculously easy to set up for you. Low prep is the best, am I right?
I made this LEGO sensory bin with water for my three year old and I have to admit that it is one of my favorites. It has the perfect punch of color from the LEGO and it encouraged so much learning and imaginative play. And goodness, it was so hard to narrow down the photos on this one! I had so many beautiful photos!
Easy LEGO Sensory Bin with Water
Water
LEGO bricks
Kitchen utensils - We always use a big bowl, a ladle, a whisk, and a large spoon.
Hands on Fun with LEGO Sensory Soup!
Using kitchen utensils, such as the large spoons and a whisk, encourage lots of scooping, pouring, and measuring, which is great for fine motor development.
And I like I mentioned, there were too many beautiful photos to pick from so I'm sharing a bunch of the scooping and pouring close ups. They're just all too lovely not to share!
And don't forget to stir it all up! Stirring the LEGO around with the whisk ended up creating a lot of "music" or noise. Just adds a nice little auditory component to this sensory activity.
Other LEGO Activities You'll Love
I promise this sensory bin is one of the easiest ever to make, as you'll shortly see. Here's what you'll need for this LEGO water sensory soup activity:Easy enough, right?Now, simply dump the LEGO bricks into some water and serve it up to the kids!Woah, thateasy - HA!This sensory bin was a hit, just like any other water sensory bin that I've made over the years.
Fury still yearns to master basic grammar but on Saturday he steps back into the ring for the first time in 10 months
"All I really need to do is count," Tyson Fury says bluntly as our second interview in five months takes another twist down the strange path followed by the giant man who might end up as the world heavyweight champion this year. "I just need to count the rounds and count me money afterwards."
This is the dark Fury. This is the grim Fury on a rainy winter morning in Cannes. This is different to the more wistful Fury I met last September, on a beautiful autumnal afternoon in Essen, a small town in Belgium. Fury was then preparing for the biggest fight of his life against David Haye. In his final week of training before facing Haye, he sounded unusually reflective.
"I'm not an educated person with any proper schooling," Fury said last year outside the Swiss-style chalet that had been his home in Essen for eight long weeks. As sunlight streamed through the trees it seemed a poignant time for Fury to consider his life as a fighter and Traveller who had left school at the age of 10.
The wooden house belonged to his trainer and uncle, Peter, who had begun to educate himself during his second long spell in prison. Fury, however, regretted his failure to have learnt how to write properly. He might have seemed on the brink of earning over a million pounds against Haye but he smiled ruefully. "I'd like to take a course in writing. I'm not the best writer in the world. I'd like to write more neatly, even though people don't send many handwritten letters these days. It bothers me but it's hard when you're one of them people who don't know where to stop sentences or put commas or exclamation marks. You feel like an illiterate dummy, don't you?"
Fury's face creased with emotion as he said: "I can fight but that's the only thing I can do. When it comes to anything other than fighting, or talking, I'm not very good."
Yet his scatter-gun intelligence had been obvious during a long conversation in which he had wafted through subjects as diverse as depression and discipline, addiction and hope, religion and money – and his complicated feelings towards Haye. The fight, of course, was postponed and then cancelled by Haye and our interview never ran.
And so we are back again with Fury training hard in Cannes before, for the first time in 10 months, he fights on Saturday night. He was meant to meet Gonzalo Omar Basile – but last week the Argentinian also withdrew from their contest with a lung infection. Fury now faces the American Joey Abell at the Copper Box in London in his debut for Frank Warren's BoxNation channel. But his desire to improve his level of literacy has been dented.
"I'm not really interested in that at the minute," Fury says when I ask what happened to his yearning to master basic grammar. His stream of abusive and homophobic tweets to Haye, Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko would have had the Fury of Essen hanging his head in shame.
"@mrdavidhaye Is a fucking shit house cunt! …" is a pretty boring tweet. But Fury's grammar and punctuation is disappointingly sloppy in the heat of another tweet: "If @LennoxLewis has any balls left at all come fight me & ill have u carried out on a stretcher u fucking pussy! Come & try!!!"
There is no need to worry about Lewis's reaction, for the once great heavyweight champion is bright enough not to take Fury seriously, but I'm missing the boxer who spoke touchingly about the elusive art of the hard-written letter. "I'm just interested in winning the next few fights and making plenty of money," Fury says, putting up with my chiding. "Probably when I'm retired from boxing we might take some time out and do some advanced writing lessons. It could be good but at the moment I'm busy with my career."
After his stark plug for the benefits of numeracy ahead of literacy in the crude old fight game, Fury is again in a talkative mood. "I had a lottery win a few months ago and then it got taken away," he says of his lost Haye money-spinner. "You'd be upset, wouldn't you? It was like winning the lottery – being a week away from spending your money and then suddenly not having any of it any more. It's hard to adjust. At least Joey Abell's not like David Haye. Joey will come and take a beating … no doubt about that."
Fury reverts to simple addition as he counts the cost of the Haye cancellation. "I lost £150,000 in expenses. It also cost me my pay-per-view purse and a final IBF eliminator, so that was a few million more. It's sickening really but I'm only 25. It's not like I'm 42 and near the end of my career. I don't need David Haye and his antics to earn money.
"I was so fed up I retired for a few months but now I'm back with a vengeance. I've come back because I need the money. I can't get another job, so it looks like I've got to do this job for the rest of my life."
He sounds a little desolate but whether Fury is happy or sad, confused or elated, he always talks openly. And so we return to the homophobia that breaks out so often when he's angry. In October 2012 he blamed his cousins for posting spleen in his name on Twitter when he threatened his heavyweight rival David Price that he was going to put "you and gay lover Tony Bellew" in intensive care.
His cousins were not involved when, last October, he followed predictable tweets abusing Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko with homophobia. "I think @LennoxLewis & wlad @Klitschko r 100% Homosexuals!!"
Fury's father named him after Mike Tyson. And so I tell him how, in our interview last month, it was interesting hearing Tyson celebrate the layered life of Panama Al Brown – who, apart from becoming boxing's first Hispanic world champion in the 1920s, had a long affair with the gay French writer and film-maker Jean Cocteau. "I've never heard of him," Fury says of Brown.
Does Fury believe it's impossible for a gay man to be tough? "I don't know. If a man likes to mess around with another man it's his own business isn't it? But I'm an old-fashioned person. I'm a married man with kids. I'm not interested in all that stuff. I don't even want to go there."
So why does he seem to enjoy using homosexuality as a supposed insult on Twitter? "Look, I try to get myself big fights. You've got to get out there and so I try to lure them into taking a fight against me. I give them the bait. But Lennox doesn't want to fight no more, does he? The Boxing Board of Control gave me some fines but boys will be boys and I've got to speak my mind haven't I?
"I've been fined 17 grand – last time it was 10 grand, the time before that it was seven. It's just chucking money down the drain but I'm getting fined for speaking my mind. You can't be honest in this day and age but I'm going to keep being honest and keep getting into trouble."
Warren has announced his intention to match Fury against Dereck Chisora in the summer – probably at Upton Park – in another clash of two volatile heavyweights. Fury won their first encounter, on points over 12 rounds in July 2011, but Chisora has since became much more infamous for slapping Vitali Klitschko before their 2012 world title fight, in which he fought creditably between the ropes, and then for threatening to shoot Haye in the brawling aftermath.
Chisora has also bitten an opponent in the ring – and kissed another at the weigh-in. When Klitschko shook his head primly and said: "I'm very conservative. I only kiss women," Chisora drawled, "I swing both ways, player, I swing both ways. Don't worry about that."
It was the kind of provocative statement that might unsettle Fury. I also remind him that, when I interviewed him just before he fought Klitschko, Chisora said: "People are ignorant. Bisexuality started a long, long time ago. You just have to support it. There's nothing wrong with it. I support the gays 24/7."
Fury pauses. "If he wants to be a bisexual or whatever that's up to him really. He can be what he wants … as long as he doesn't interfere with me."
It is striking that Fury and Chisora, who can be such opposites amid their wild outbursts, should harbour mutual respect and even like each other.
"I get on well with him," Fury says of Chisora, who also fights on Saturday's bill. "We had a hard fight last time and there's no bad blood there. It's purely business. I've got this warm-up against Abell and then it'll be Chisora. After that I'll be the mandatory for a world title. That's when the real games begin. I'm a prizefighter fighting for a prize. All I'm interested in is money. I don't care about nothing else. I don't care about world titles or being a hero."
Fury recalls our first interview. "You came to see me in Morecambe," he chuckles. "I remember it well." In November 2011, Fury told me that he felt "sad, like commit-suicide-sad" and "messed up" before, looking around the front room where we sat with his wife, Paris, and their exotically named children Venezuela and Prince, he admitted that: "I really feel like smashing this place up."
Now, Fury says cheerfully that should he and Paris have another child, "I like the name Hunter for a boy. Hunter Fury? It's got a ring to it."
So how is his state of mind today when, every time I meet him, he always cuts such a contrasting figure? "The state of mind is good. I'm ready for a decent fight. Joey Abell's had 29 wins, 28 knockouts, seven losses. He boxed [the unbeaten] Kubrat Pulev last time out and Joey put him down, so it's a good little test for me. I have a nightmare every time I fight a southpaw like him, so it could be interesting."
This is a sensible way to sell a match-up against an anonymous journeyman. But the fight that Fury really wants is against Wladimir Klitschko. "I don't know whether he wants to fight me," Fury says. "I don't think anyone really believes, deep down, that they can beat me. It's a massive task fighting someone like me who is 6ft 9in and who trains really hard, who can box for 12 rounds at a fast pace. To think they can beat me? They're kidding themselves. But I'd love it to be Wlad. I'd talk up a storm for that one … "

Did we recently witness one of the best all-time atmospheres at Talen Energy Stadium?
Last Sunday's nationally televised game against New York had a 2011 vibe to it, which means that the stadium was full, the fans were rowdy, and the game actually meant something in the eastern conference standings.
It wasn't hard to recognize the malaise that had settled over Talen in recent years. The novelty of having a new team wore off in 2012, and the Union plodded through several years of underwhelming performances both on the field and in the front office. More often than not, the River End was only three quarters full. The stadium maybe reached 65 percent capacity on a good day.
Some folks bounced around the topic on social media – what game featured the best atmosphere in Chester?
Not counting last Sunday, here's what I came up with.
5. Union vs. Seattle Sounders – June 27th, 2010
This was the very first game at PPL Park.
The stadium was not completed until late June in 2010, so the Union had actually played eight of the first 10 games on the road. Those two home games took place at Lincoln Financial Field, with Sebastien Le Toux scoring a hat trick in a 3-2 win against D.C., and Danny Mwanga banging in a stoppage-time equalize for a 1-1 draw with Dallas.
Philly was 2-7-1 at this point in the season. Expectations were not high in year number one, but the buzz of having a brand-new team in town carried everybody through a mostly mediocre inaugural campaign. People were excited about this game, not only because it was the debut of the stadium, but also because they only had two opportunities to see their new team over the course of three months.
Pat Noonan scored the first goal in stadium history to give Seattle a 1-0 halftime lead. Philly came back to equalize through Sebastien Le Toux, then Chris Seitz stoned Noonan on a penalty to keep the game level. The Union added two more goals for a 3-1 win.
4. Union vs. Houston Dynamo – October 10th, 2011 (MLS Cup Playoffs)
To this day, it's still the only postseason game played in Chester.
The atmosphere was unique, almost like a mix of excitement, anxiety, and uneasiness. This was, after all, a new experience for a young fan base and a young team. Nobody really knew what to expect against a Houston side that featured plenty of veteran talent and savvy.
Peter Nowak inexplicably rolled out a five-man defense for this game, which was a wrinkle that we hadn't seen all season long. Philly conceded just five minutes into the game, only for Le Toux to equalize just two minutes later.
The new shape didn't fit the Union, who just weren't themselves in this game. Calen Carr added a second goal and Houston earned a 2-1 win in the first leg of the series.
3. Union vs. New York Red Bulls - April 9th, 2011
I think this was the best atmosphere of 2011, even better than the playoff game.
This was a nationally televised matchup against New York that took place just four games into the season. That's really the key here. Philly was a different team in 2011, and after opening the season with two straight wins, fans were on board from the very beginning of the campaign.
Fan-favorite Roger Torres scored the game-winner with his very first touch of the ball. The PPL crowd went absolutely bonkers, maybe the loudest roar I've heard for any Union goal.
One of the things that stood out about this game was that it was early April and still rather cold outside. In recent seasons, the stadium hasn't started to fill up until it the weather begins to turn. You didn't get that in 2011. Fans came out regularly in March, April, and October. You really felt like people were dialed in from day one, and this game convinced a lot of people that the Union might actually be a contender in their second season.
2. Union vs. Sporting Kansas City – September 30th, 2015 (U.S. Open Cup final)
Without a doubt, the U.S. Open Cup finals have to be at the top of the list.
I'd put 2015's final at #2, just because it was the second season in a row that this game was played at PPL Park.
This was a tight affair, and the crowd was definitely larger than the one that had showed up for the 2014 final against Seattle. Philly opened the scoring through Le Toux after a brilliant assist from Vincent Nogueira.
By far, the most intense part of the game was the penalty shootout to decide the champion. It took place in front of the River End and the crowd was absolutely dialed-in. The scene in the press box was frantic, with journos not knowing whether to tweet, or write, or just sit there and observe instead. Everybody was on pins and needles.
It was nothing short of heartbreak for Philly, but credit where it's due – Sporting was absolutely clinical in the shootout.
1. Union vs. Seattle Sounders – September 16th, 2014 (U.S. Open Cup final)
How can a game be #1 on this list when it wasn't even sold out?
I'll try to explain.
This game, even with a crowd numbering around 12,000, just came with an aura of authenticity. The Union were terrible in the league that season and didn't even register on the radar of the average Philadelphia sports fan.
The people who showed up were diehards. They were the educated and loyal fans who had stuck with the team through three crappy seasons. The relatively sparse crowd matched the volume of a sold-out stadium, which spoke volumes about those in attendance.
There weren't any casual fans at this game. These were Union diehards, who understood the gravity of this match. This was an opportunity for the club to win its first trophy, and these fans wanted to be there to see it.
Both teams played an excellent game. It may actually be the best game I've ever seen at PPL Park. The Union certainly didn't look like the team we had seen struggle throughout the regular season.
In the end, it came down to depth, and Seattle got the job done in extra time when they were able to bring Obafemi Martins, Marco Pappa, and Gonzalo Pineda off the bench.
After assembling an ensemble cast that shocked most of the NBA when they finished the season with a 57-25 record, Nuggets GM Masai Ujiri was the runaway winner of the 2013 Executive of the Year Award.
Over the last few seasons, Ujiri has kept Denver near the top of the league despite the contentious departure of Carmelo Anthony. The Nuggets' success stands in sharp contrast to teams like the Cavaliers, Raptors and Hornets, who have sunk to the depths of the NBA following the departure of their franchise players.

The commute of the future will likely involve self-driving cars, but Virginia roadways are being outfitted now for that eventuality.
WASHINGTON — The commute of the future will likely involve driverless cars, but Virginia roadways are being outfitted now for that eventuality.
“We're gonna now do about 80 miles of roads that we're going to put the sensors in,” said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, referring to the 95 and 495 Express Lanes, which will be the setting for the testing of autonomous cars.
“All the roads we're building now are gonna have the sensors for autonomous vehicles,” said McAuliffe. “This is the future.”
McAuliffe said 75 percent of the country's testing of autonomous vehicles will take place in Virginia.
Initially, testing will take place on portions of the toll lanes that are closed to other vehicles.
“People are concerned,” acknowledged McAuliffe, on WTOP's “Ask the Governor” show, Wednesday. “We're not going to do anything that would affect security on the roads — no state would do that.”
McAuliffe recounted an opportunity he had last year to drive an autonomous Lexus, on I-64, in Richmond, near the governor's mansion.
“I didn't mean to do it, but it got up to 90 in 10 seconds,” said McAuliffe. “I got it down to the speed limit, and I put it on ‘autonomous' — it drove, and I went 10 miles without touching anything.”
As WTOP first reported, after testing in closed 95 and 495 Express Lanes, eventually real-world testing will be done during “light traffic conditions.”
In addition to self-driving cars, the Federal Aviation Administration has designated Virginia Tech as a test site for unmanned aircraft systems, or drones.
McAuliffe said safety will not be sacrificed as the commonwealth attempts to be at the forefront of new technologies.
“It is taking it to the next level, it's coming,” said McAuliffe. “I want Virginia leading the way, but I promise you, everybody's gonna be safe.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official filed suit late on Sunday trying to prevent President Donald Trump from naming an acting head of the watchdog agency, but its top lawyer concluded Trump had the power to do so.

The moves were the latest dramatic developments in the fight over leadership succession of an agency created in 2011 under Democratic former President Barack Obama to protect consumers from predatory lending practices. Republicans in the White House and Congress have tried to weaken the agency.
The leadership of the agency was plunged into confusion on Friday after its outgoing Obama-era director Richard Cordray formally resigned and elevated his former chief of staff, Leandra English, to replace him on an interim basis until the Senate confirms a permanent successor named by Trump.
Hours later, the Republican president named Mulvaney — his budget chief and a harsh critic of the agency — as its acting director.
CFPB General Counsel Mary McLeod wrote a memo, first reported by Reuters, concurring with the opinion of the U.S. Justice Department that Trump had the power to appoint Mulvaney to the post.
“I advise all Bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that Director Mulvaney is the Acting Director of the CFPB,” McLeod's memo stated.
Late on Sunday, English sued in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeking a temporary restraining order blocking Trump from appointing Mulvaney. In the filing, English said Mulvaney had no experience in a consumer protection or financial regulatory role, had sought to get rid of the agency and once described it as a “sad, sick joke.”
McLeod's intervention bolstered Trump's position and isolated English, 34, who has held multiple jobs at the CFPB since its creation.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Trump administration is aware of English's lawsuit, but said “the law is clear” and that Mulvaney is the acting director. Sanders pointed to McLeod's conclusion, adding that “there should be no question” that Mulvaney can take the job.
‘POLITICAL AMBITION'
“It is unfortunate that Mr. Cordray decided to put his political ambition above the interests of consumers with this stunt. Director Mulvaney will bring a more serious and professional approach to running the CFPB,” Sanders said.
Both sides in the battle say they have the law on their side.
Democrats have said the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the agency stipulated that its deputy director would take over on an interim basis when a director departs until the Senate confirms a permanent director. Cordray named English as deputy director and said she would become the acting director.
“It's a very important fact ... their own general counsel came out with a different conclusion,” said Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP said. “Now that the thing is in court, I think it is really going to be in the hands of the judge.”
Trump administration officials said the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives a president the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi-member boards, an exemption they said did not apply to the CFPB.
“The president's attempt to install a White House official at the head of independent agency — while allowing that official to simultaneously serve in the White House — is unprecedented,” said English's lawyer, Deepak Gupta of the law firm Gupta Wessler, adding that “the law is clear” and that English is the acting director.
Created after the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has issued rules and imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies. [L8N1NW0MW]
Future enforcement activities could be stymied while the question of who runs the CFPB is decided.

Republican lawmakers argue that the agency wields too much unchecked power, adding that it burdens banks and credit card companies with unnecessary red tape.
Writing on Twitter, Trump on Saturday called the agency a “total disaster” that had “devastated” financial institutions.

On his way back from a business trip, the protagonist decides on a whim to take a train back to his old hometown. The moment he pays respects to his mother's grave in the transformed town, he is transported back to a summer when he was still in junior high school, only with all his middle-age consciousness, knowledge and abilities intact. On this journey across time, he understands for the first time the burdens born by his father, and his mother's tears. This is the kind of fantasy manga were made for, executed by an artist of great talent. This is a serious, delicate, and ultimately moving time travel variation. Middle-aged salaryman Hiroshi Nakahara accidentally takes a train ride back to his old hometown to visit his mother's grave. Then for reasons he can't explain, Hiroshi is transported back in time, and discovers that he's an 8th grader again, but with all of his adult memories intact. Can he, or should he try to change the decisions he made before? But more importantly, can he find his way back to the present day, or is he stuck in the past?
Trading Dougie Hamilton, a young cornerstone talent on the blueline, signaled the first major move in Don Sweeney's tenure as general manager of the Boston Bruins. The trade, horrendous, subtracted arguably the teams top defenseman whilst bringing nothing back to help the roster in 2015-2016. Far from an ideal, or intelligent, way to begin the 2015 offseason.
In 2016, Sweeney doubled down. Instead of trading a rarity in the league -- an elite right-handed defenseman under the age of 25 -- Sweeney resigned a replaceable bottom-pairing defenseman, Kevan Miller, for a cap hit twice the value of what the player's production actually warrants.
Perhaps it's a strategy; make your initial offseason transaction your most egregious. That way anything afterwards seems like a grand slam. Which, is how it played out in 2015. Sweeney traded Milan Lucic for a return of two first-round picks, prospect Sean Kuraly and promising defenseman Colin Miller. Free agent forward Matt Beleskey, Lucic's replacement, signed to a rather team-friendly cap hit of $3.8 million. Both moves improved the club, plain and simple.
Resigning Miller was not necessary. Bringing back a 29-year-old with no upside left to unearth does not improve a team, and by no means should it have become a priority. Yet, for some ungodly reason it was. Restricted free agent Torey Krug is a far more pressing concern. After all, Krug is currently the second best defenseman on your roster. Such a statement speaks both of Krug's value and also to dire situation Boston's blueline currently finds itself in: a critical lack of high-end talent.
Fellow restricted free agent Colin Miller has top-four potential, and thus efforts to retain his services should have taken precedence over the efforts to keep the less talented Miller. It's not a good look when your opening move does nothing to improve your team, especially considering it hogs $2.5 million in cap space -- an amount best suited to aid in the improvement of pressing needs, not to spend on locking-down yet another bottom-pairing defenseman.
Yes, as of today, there is $9.25 million tied up in Miller, Adam McQuaid and Dennis Seidenberg headed into next season. Quite a large sum to spend on a trio of tire fires that even the most daring of arsonists would balk at the thought of owning. Though, the likelihood of all three being on the roster come opening day is fairly minimal, one hopes.
Buying out Seidenberg's contract frees up $2.83 million in cap room. Finding a trade partner for McQuaid won't be easy, but it can be done. If Kevan Miller's value on the open market is as high as some believe, then frankly anything is possible.
Last thing fans want to hear, but true: Miller would have gotten higher AAV in free agency. Begs Q of why they didn't move him at deadline — DJ Bean (@DJ_Bean) May 24, 2016
A theoretical McQuaid trade opens up another $2.75 million. McQuaid and Seidenberg's freed up space becomes the money necessary to retain Krug, while opening regular spots in the lineup for Colin Miller and perhaps one of Joe Morrow or Zach Trotman. In essence, it becomes addition by subtraction. The Bruins rid themselves of two underperforming defensemen in exchange for younger in-house talents with plenty of room to grow.
It isn't a perfect roster, but there's roughly $20 million in cap room to use on finding another top-pairing defenseman, as well as resigning Loui Eriksson or an Eriksson-caliber forward if Loui feels inclined to find a new home. Keeping Miller doesn't rid the Bruins of all their cap flexibility, put it puts pressure on finding moves that will. Finding a trade partner for McQuaid is no certainty, and buying out Seidenberg, while seeming like a common sense move, may prove too difficult a task for this front office.
Kevan Miller, at a cap hit of $2.5 million, is far from the end of the world. It's not ideal, nor necessary, especially with the current roster, but it won't look half as bad if Sweeney and co. shuffle their remaining pieces properly. For now, yes, we can whine and complain about how dumb, how wasteful, how completely idiotic such a move is, but again, it's just the first domino to fall. And in typical Sweeney fashion, it's likely to be the ugliest.
Image caption Evernote insists no payment data or personal details were accessed, changed or lost
Online information storage firm Evernote has asked all users to reset their passwords, following a security breach by hackers.
The California-based company, that allows people to store and organise personal data on an external server, is thought to have about 50 million users.
It said user names, email addresses and encrypted passwords were accessed.
But it insisted there was "no evidence" that payment details or stored content was accessed, changed or lost.
Evernote acts like an online personal organiser, with users able to save data such as video clips, images, web pages, notes and itineraries in an external storage system commonly known as the cloud.
In a statement on the company's website, the firm said its security team discovered and blocked "suspicious activity on [their] network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the Evernote service".
It added: "While our password encryption measures are robust, we are taking additional steps to ensure that your personal data remains secure.
"This means that, in an abundance of caution, we are requiring all users to reset their Evernote account passwords."
The firm apologised "for the annoyance" caused by the breach, which it said is becoming "far more common" at other "large services".
In February, Apple revealed a "small number" of its computers had been hacked, but added there was no sign of data theft.
The hack came a week after social-networking firm Facebook said it had traced a cyber-attack back to China after some of its employee laptops were hacked.
A month ago, micro-blogging website Twitter announced it had been the victim of a security breach which compromised the accounts of 250,000 users.
The company's information security director, Bob Lord, said the attack "was not the work of amateurs".
Arsène Wenger has no intention of drawing a line under his management career this summer because, for him, “retirement equals death”.
The Arsenal manager's future is shrouded in doubt, with his contract at the north London club up at the end of the season and no announcement about an extension yet made.
This season has represented the most turbulent period of his 20 years at the club, with his side's on-pitch failings resulting in widespread fan anger and even protests.
Arsenal have not won the Premier League title since 2004 and have spent most of this season well off the pace, with Chelsea and their new manager, Antonio Conte, running away with it.
At 67, it has been suggested that Wenger may decide to walk away from Arsenal and management all together. But when asked whether that is an option for him, his response was unequivocal.
From Love Story:
Men are expected to perform. To be successful, to get the girl, to live a good life, men must do. Whether it's riding wheelies down the street on your bicycle to get that cute girl's attention or to get a doctorate degree to ensure your personal success and your future family's, Men must perform. Women's arousal, attraction, desire and love are rooted in that conditional performance. The degree to which that performance meets or exceeds expectations is certainly subjective, and the ease with which you can perform is also an issue, but perform you must.
One of the most fundamental misconceptions plugged-in men have with regard to their intersexual relations with women is the issue of performance. Back in late March of this year I read an interesting article from Roosh, Men are nothing more than clowns to the modern woman and it struck me that although I certainly agreed with him in the context he presented it, there was more to the ‘entertainment' factor than simple amusement on the part of women.
Women don't seek out comfort or stability in men anymore—they seek entertainment. They seek distraction. They seek hedonistic pleasure. This is why provider men (beta males) are so hopelessly failing today to secure the commitment of beautiful women in their prime, and this is why even lesser alpha males fail to enter relationships with women beyond a few bangs. Once the entertainment or novelty you provide her declines—and it inevitably will—she moves on to something or someone else. In essence, the only way you can keep a girl is if you adopt the mentality of a soap opera writer, adding a cliffhanger to the end of each episode that keeps a woman interested when being a good man no longer does.
After reading this I tried to imagine myself being a recently unplugged man or a guy just coming to terms with the uncomfortable truths of the red pill and learning that all of the comforting “just be yourself and the right girl will come along” rhetoric everyone convinced me of had been replaced by a disingenuous need to transform oneself into a cartoon character in order to hold the attentions of an average girl.
That's kind of depressing, especially when you consider the overwhelming effort and personal insight necessary in realizing red pill awareness. Roosh later tempered this with How to be a good clown and Clown Game vs. Good Man Game, and although he clarifies things well in Game terms, the root of the frustration most guys will have with the ‘clown factor' is that, in these terms and in this context, their performance isn't who they are.
In this environment it's easy to see why the MGTOW option seems like an understandable recourse for red pill men. It's a very seductive temptation to think that a man can simply remove himself from the performance equation with regards to women. I'll touch on this later, but what's important here is understanding the performance game men are necessarily born into. Like it or not, play it or not, as a man you will always be evaluated on your performance (or the perception of it).
I think what trips a lot of men up early in their red pill transformation is sort of a sense of indignation towards women that they should have to “be someone they're not” and play a character role that simply isn't who they are in order to hold a woman's interest. I covered this idea in Have A Look and developed how women are like casting agents when it comes to the men they hope will entertain them.
This was really about a sexual context when I went into it, but as I read Roosh's original article I began to consider that women's “character” role they expect men to perform changes as their own phases of maturity dictates and their SMV can realistically demand for that phase. In other words the “characters” they want performed in their Party Years will be different than the ones they want after their Epiphany Phase, which may be different than the character they want for their mid-life years.
How realistic it is for men to be that character becomes less and less relevant as women are socialized to expect disappointment from men actually living up to the characters they're conditioned to believe they should realistically be entitled to at various stages of their maturity.
Living Up
Right about now I'm sure various male readers are thinking, “fuck this, I'm gonna be who I am and any girl who can't appreciate me for me is low quality anyway.” This will probably piss you off, but this is exactly the blue pill mentality most ‘just be yourself‘ Betas adopt for themselves.
It's actually a law of power to despise what you can't have, and deductively it makes sense, but the fact still remains, as a man you will always be evaluated by your performance. So even with a ‘fuck it, I'll just be me' mindset you're still being evaluated on how well ‘you are just you'.
The simple fact is that you must actually be your performance – it must be internalized. In truth, you already are that performance whether you dictate and direct that, or you think you can forget it and hope your natural, undirected performance will be appreciated by women (and others), but regardless, women will filter for hypergamous optimization based on how well you align with what they believe they are entitled to in a man in the context of their own perception of their SMV.
Looks, talent, tangible benefits and other core prerequisites may change depending on the individual woman, but to be a man is to perform. Even if you're a self-defined man going his own way who enjoys escorts to fulfill his needs, you still need to perform in order to earn the money to enjoy them.
It Doesn't Get Easier, You Get Better
For Men, there is no true rest from performance. To believe so is to believe in women's mythical capacity for a higher form of empathy which would perdispose them to overriding their innate hypergamous filtering based on performance.
Women will never have the same requisites of performance for themselves for which they expect men to maintain of themselves. Hypergamy demands a constant, subliminal reconfirmation of a man's worthiness of her commitment to him, so there is never a parallel of experience.
Women will claim men “require” they meet some physical standard (i.e. performance) and while generally true, this is still a performance standard men have of women, not one they hold for themselves. There simply is no reciprocal dynamic or prequalification of performance for women, and in fact for a man to even voice the idea that he might qualify a woman for his intimacy he's characterized as judgmental and misogynistic.
Social conventions like this are established to ensure women's hypergamous sexual strategy is the socially dominant one. Expecting a woman to perform for a man is an insult to her ‘prize status' as an individual.
From a humanistic perspective there's a want for a rational solution to this performance requirement, but as I've outlined in prior posts, appeals to women's reason are no insulation against the subliminal influences of hypergamy.
I read many a ‘dating coach' who's approach is complete honesty and full disclosure in the hopes that a like-minded, rational woman will naturally appreciate a man's forthrightness, but this presupposes a preexisting equal playing field where subliminal influences are overridden by mutual rationalism.
The real hope is that women will drop their innate hypergamous performance requisites in appreciation of this vulnerable, inadequate honesty.
What they sweep under the rug is that you cannot appeal to a woman's reason or sentiment to genuinely forgive a deficit in a man's performance. Love, reason, both demand a preexisting mutual appreciation in a common context, but neither love nor reason alleviate the necessity of performance for a man.
Women simply are not motivated to compromise hypergamy on their own accord. They will not be reasoned into accommodating a situation of mutual needs by overt means.
It is a Man's capacity to perform and demonstrate (never explicate) higher value that motivates women to accommodate mutual needs in a relationship – whether that's a same night lay or a 50 year marriage.
Demonstrating Higher Value
I get the impression that DHV tends to get a bad rap both from blue pill critics and red pill aware men. A lot of that gets wrapped up in technique and practice. It's easy to dismiss this concept as posturing or bluster, but DHV, as a principle isn't defined by egotistical measures or how well a guy can ‘showboat' himself around women.
A lot of DHV is unintentional. In fact the best most genuine forms of DHV are exhibited when a Man doesn't realize he's actually performing in a way that demonstrate his higher value. This can be as simple as walking int a room in the right context or environment. Even humility can be DHV in the proper context.
What I'm driving at here is that after reading all of this you might think I'm saying you need to be superhuman to qualify for women's performance standards, and again that's kind of depressing – that's not what I'm getting at. A woman's performance standards are dependent on many varied contexts and according to the priorities she places on the type of character she finds both arousing and attractive and according to what her conditions dictate for her.
It's not how you perform so much as that you perform. Ambition and personal drive to perform and be the best and most successful you you can be may have absolutely nothing to do with your intention of attracting a woman, but you are still performing and you will be evaluated on that performance.
DHV or DLV is performance whether intentional or not. You cannot remove yourself from this performance equation. You can cease to direct your part in this performance, but until you die you cannot exit the game.

On beloved books
Ryan: We built bookshelves starting halfway up the wall, so we could put a turntable and cabinet below. I got my PhD in philosophy, so most of these books are my old grad school books. Law is a second career for me. Since Chelsea had a good job in Toronto, I wanted to stay with her instead of following my academic career to small towns far away. I knew I could apply similar thinking to a career in the law. But I also love Patricia Highsmith! I'll bring The Talented Mr. Ripley to the beach.
BEDROOM
Bed: EQ3. Filing cabinet (for socks and underwear): Craigslist. Bedside table: vintage. Round lamp: IKEA.
On clever storage
Chelsea: Behind a white denim curtain, under the stairs, is a huge storage area where we keep winter clothes and Ryan's movie collection. Some are even VHS! They're his babies that come with us every time we move.
On white shirts as decor
Ryan: We hang our clothes on open racks around our bed. Since people can see this rack when they walk in the front door, we decided to put only one color there, so it didn't look so much like you're looking into someone's closet.
Chelsea: Of course it attracts EVERYONE'S attention because it's all white shirts.
Mountain artwork: silk scarf from Fieldguided.
On living with Otto
Chelsea: Our dog Otto is basically our baby. He sleeps in our bed.
Ryan: He takes up as much room as either of us do. And everyone who comes over ends up loving him.
Chelsea: Our good friends even named their restaurant after him.
On a comfy bed
Chelsea: We always have soft white bamboo cotton bedding. We make the bed every morning because it adds a sense of calm. Also, this building is definitely not soundproof. Our lease even has a section that talks about the sound. So, we bought an excellent Dohm white noise machine. That helps when one of us wants to sleep in, too.
On personal artwork
Ryan: Only we can see this framed artwork because they're on the interior wall of the loft. They're the only personal photos of us that are hung up. Chelsea: The flier is from a museum that we visited on our honeymoon in Germany. It feels romantic.
On a secret TV
Chelsea: We also have a TV mounted on the brick that faces the bed. We watch movies every night. We have another TV in the living area, too. It's a lot of TVs for a small space!
Basket: vintage, similar.
On having a clean house
Chelsea: We keep things neat because we often work from home. In our old place, we had a spare room that became The Junk Room. You can't do that here. Ryan: We don't have anything in our house that we don't use once a month or more.
LIVING AREA
Sofa: IKEA. Rug: EQ3. Coffee table: Craigslist.
On favorite movies
Chelsea: We love relaxing on the sofa — we're both big movie buffs. The Toronto International Film Festival every September is the best part of living here.
On 15 minutes of fame
Ryan: We were actually extras in the film Capote! You can only see us for a second, but we got to watch Phillip Seymour Hoffman do his method acting; each line had a variation because he was just doing it from feeling.
Chelsea: We were told to dress up as '60s intellectuals going to a talk. We got our hair and makeup done. It was really cool. All we had to do is sit in an audience and give standing ovations. All afternoon.
On Toronto home stores
Chelsea: I like the pottery from a store called Easy Tiger — we have a speckled pot by Workaday. We also love a tiny vintage place called rec + ART HISTORY. The owner has an amazing eye.
KITCHEN AREA
Pendant light: similar. Lockers (for shoes and jackets): Craiglist.
On decorating with souvenirs
Chelsea: We found the photo of a Persian rug on a trip to Berlin five years ago. We rolled it up and brought it home. We love decorating with souvenirs, and we'd love to do more traveling.
Ryan: One day.
Chelsea: We're planning a trip to Hong Kong and Japan. If Ryan passes the bar exam in June —
Ryan: I'll pass it!
Chelsea: Then the next day we'll go. That's the plan.
On ingredients on display
Chelsea: Putting food into glass jars makes it look prettier on open shelving. We must cook a lot because we're constantly refilling these jars! We're pescetarians so we cook a lot of lentils and split peas. Five ingredients we always have on hand: olive oil, fresh parsley, halloumi cheese, cumin and turmeric.
Ryan: I also really like black rice. It's slightly earthier.
Carafe: IKEA. Glasses: EQ3.
On home cooking
Chelsea: We cook a lot from Ottolenghi cookbooks. And the Gjelina cookbook. When I'm home by myself, I'll have bread and cheese from the cheese shop nearby.
Ryan: We have nice cheese shops and a French bakery one block away.
Chelsea: Our area has everything we need — a library, good coffee…
Ryan: Cute bars.
Chelsea: And a dog park.
Thank you so much, Chelsea and Ryan!
P.S. More home tours, including a rainbow bookcase in Manhattan and a woodsy cottage in New Hampshire.

Trans man Seamus Johnston, previously in the news for being expelled from the University of Pittsburgh for using the men's locker room after being told not to, was subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury. This comes after being investigated by the FBI regarding the continuing rash of bomb threats hampering the college campus.
While Johnston has since filed a discrimination complaint against the university, however, he faces trial on three misdemeanors counts resulting from on-campus incidents related to the bathroom ban.
Johnston reportedly said that he and his partner, Katherine Anne McCloskey, a trans woman, were being investigated in the bomb threats case because of his earlier expulsion, but both he and his partner claim to have no involvement or knowledge of the bomb threats.

Five stripes, two red and three black, are the featured look on the front of Atlanta United's inaugural home jersey for its 2017 season. The back is solid red. The player's names and numbers will be in gold.
The team's crest is displayed over the heart, and its primary sponsor, American Family Insurance, is in gold across the chest with three gold stripes along the shoulders. The jersey, designed by Adidas, was a year in the making from the first concepts until Tuesday's unveiling at The Tabernacle. The shorts and socks are black with gold trim.
Atlanta United players Chris McCann, Hector Villalba, and Andrew Carleton were the models for the jersey, walking onto the stage to a chorus of cheers as smoke and confetti filled the air.
According to the team, the kit was designed to fulfill the team's mission to bring passion, inspiration and world-class soccer to Atlanta.
The unveiling featured video appearances from Hawks center Dwight Howard, a soccer fan, as well as Falcons players Mohamed Sanu, Vic Beasley and Sean Weatherspoon.
Mayor Kasim Reed got the crowd fired up with chants of “Uncle Arthur” before team president Arthur Blank, club president Darren Eales and American Family Insurance CEO Jack Salzwedel addressed the more than 2,000 people who attended.
“Tonight was incredible,” Blank said. “It was a reflection of Atlanta, a reflection of the support and the enthusiasm from the time of the announcement several years ago. It's been unbelievable.”
Jerseys were being sold in The Tabernacle, as well as the team store in Atlantic Station and online at www.atltud.com.
The Authentic jerseys will feature 2017 with the words inaugural season across the nape of the neck, and the crest on the front will feature a brighter gold. The Replica version of the jerseys don't feature those two unique elements.
Atlanta United manager Gerardo Martino said he's never seen support like he saw on Tuesday for an expansion club with no history. It was a sentiment shared by McCann and Villalba.
“I think it's a beautiful kit, it's wonderful,” Villalba, who appreciates fashion, said through a translator.
The team's away kit will be unveiled in February. The academy players will wear the home jerseys, also.
Blank said he saw the jersey once before the unveiling. It was shown to him at his house and was modeled by his son Josh, a soccer player.
“It looked magnificent,” Blank said. “I personally love the kits and most importantly our fans love it. It's what we are about unity, yet conquer. That's really the history of Atlanta to support diverstiy, bring in diversity, support that unity, which is always important and particularly important in these times, and to be a championship team.”
Eales said the team went through several concepts.
“We wanted something that was both traditional but progressive,” Eales said.
Only one club in MLS, Montreal, currently has stripes. Eales said they feel that seeing the red-and-black stripes in America will make people automatically think of Atlanta United.
Atlanta United will begin play in MLS next year. It has already sold more than 22,000 season tickets — second-most in the league behind Seattle — and will play in Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium until construction is complete on Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which is supposed to happen sometime in the summer. It will train at the team's headquarters in Marietta, which are also under construction and expected to open February.
The team will have the first pick in the expansion draft, which will be held in Dec. 13. The draft will be held Jan. 13 in Los Angeles, preceded by the combine. The league's preseason begins Jan. 23.

Steyer, a billionaire and major Democratic donor, is highly regarded by the White House, snagging a coveted spot at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.
Steyer wrote a multimillion-dollar check and teamed with former secretary of state George Shultz to help defeat a referendum that would have rolled back California's ambitious renewable energy legislation. And he donated millions to create sustainable energy and a finance center at Stanford University, and $25 million to launch an energy sciences institute at Yale.
He's been on a fairly long list of folks who've been mentioned since the election for the job: former Clinton White House chief of staff and Obama 2008 transition head John Podesta, founder and chairman of the Center for American Progress; former Colorado governor Bill Ritter, who runs the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University; former North Dakota senator Byron Dorgan, who was on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is co-author of Blowout, an energy eco-thriller; Susan Tierney, who was co-head of the 2008 Obama transition team for energy and was assistant secretary of Energy for policy in the Clinton administration; and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist focusing on renewable energy technology firms, former top California state official and major Obama fundraiser.
While Steyer, who's also been mentioned as a potential gubernatorial candidate, is under consideration, he's also considered a man of action. That would, of course, be a tough fit in this town, where budget constraints, problems on the Hill, the administration's own seeming diffidence and getting the smallest thing done can be like a double root canal.
On the other hand, he's stepping down from his hedge fund job in two weeks, so he'll be looking for work, trying to feed the family ...
The year is 2030. After years of wrangling, the North Korean leadership agrees to stop making weapons-grade plutonium and to destroy its stockpiles. Officials invite inspectors to watch them load this nuclear fuel into reactors and transform it into a form useless for bombs. Yet the North Koreans secretly divert some plutonium and fill the reactor instead with lower-grade uranium. The uranium emits radiation, including neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts, antineutrinos—harmless and light subatomic particles that pass ghostlike even through lead or rock. Suspecting a ruse, the international authorities park an SUV-sized device near the North Korean reactor. Within months they confirm the deception via a telling pattern of antineutrinos streaming from the facility.
That scenario could become reality in coming years as tools of particle physics are used to combat illicit nuclear programs. A new proposal, detailed recently on the preprint server arXiv.org, describes how to build an antineutrino detector that could, over the course of a few months, determine if weapons-grade fuel is being used in a reactor. The need for such detection methods has become more urgent. North Korea has advanced its missile technology, and Iran has developed the capacity for its own nuclear weapons program, making verification a key issue. In March, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for a “different approach” to stymieing North Korea's nuclear aspirations, saying that diplomatic pressure alone had failed.
Antineutrinos are a by-product of the fission in a nuclear reactor, in which an atomic nucleus of a radioactive element such as plutonium splits into lighter elements. One type of radioactivity, called beta decay, releases either a positron and a neutrino or an electron and an antineutrino. That antineutrino is the “tell” for a reactor because only the radioactive elements in nuclear fuel emit lots of them at a steady rate.
Antineutrino-based nuclear surveillance is the impetus for a U.S.-led project called WATCHMAN (for WATer CHerenkov Monitor for ANtineutrinos). A WATCHMAN device would consist of a tank containing thousands of tons of gadolinium-doped water and could theoretically detect antineutrinos from an illicit reactor up to 1,000 kilometers away. It is hard to diplomatically ask a wary nation to let inspectors build giant water tanks close to heavily guarded facilities, so such detection distances are handy.
When an antineutrino hits a proton—a hydrogen nucleus in a water molecule in the giant tank—it transforms that proton into a neutron and a positron. The positron moves so fast that it emits light called Cherenkov radiation, the optical equivalent of a sonic boom produced when a charged particle moves faster than the speed of light through some substance. Nothing goes faster than light moving through a vacuum, but in another medium—such as water, glass or air—light moves slower and can be outpaced. Thus, a positron from an antineutrino will create a flash of light in a WATCHMAN tank. Meanwhile the gadolinium in the water will sop up the neutron, a process that emits a second flash. This characteristic double flash reveals the presence and direction of a nuclear reactor.
WATCHMAN can indicate whether a reactor is active and where it is but not the precise mix of fuel, such as highly enriched plutonium and uranium. Patrick Jaffke, a postdoctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and co-author of the new proposal, suggests a small version that could be placed close to a reactor to determine the type of nuclear fuel within by analyzing the activity of antineutrinos. His design would measure the spectrum and shape of the initial Cherenkov flash and thus the energy of the progenitor antineutrinos from the positrons. By charting the energy distribution of the detected positrons, an inspector could estimate how much of the total antineutrino emission was from a given fuel type in a reactor's core.
Instead of water, Jaffke suggests using plastic or another proton-packed hydrocarbon to boost the chances for antineutrino collisions and to reduce a device's size by orders of magnitude. Such a detector could then be placed within dozens of meters of a reactor.
Although such a detector would be smaller, there would still be the issue of background noise. Cosmic rays, for example, can create neutrons that look similar to ones from neutrino reactions. Putting the antineutrino detector five to 10 meters underground and fairly close to a reactor might solve this problem, says Steven Dazeley of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who led a 2016 analysis of noise issues facing WATCHMAN. Additional shielding around the device could also help.
There are other ideas for devices that need little or no shielding. And help could come from several groups around the world working on neutrino- and antineutrino-detection technologies for physics research.
“There's been a longtime search for a practical use of antineutrinos,” Jaffke says. “That's one of the coolest aspects” of using the particles to detect weapons-grade nuclear fuel. Let's hope it doesn't find any.

Total electricity sales in 2015 fell 1.1% from the previous year, marking the fifth time in the past eight years that electricity sales have fallen. The flattening of total electricity sales reflects declining sales in the industrial sector and little or no growth in sales to the residential and commercial building sectors, despite growth in the number of households and growth in commercial building space. Declining rates of electricity demand growth reflect a combination of factors, including the market saturation and increasing efficiency of electricity-using equipment, a slowing rate of economic growth, and the changing composition of the economy, which has reduced the role of electricity-intensive manufacturing.
Some improvements in energy efficiency have been market driven, reflecting the interest of consumers and businesses in reducing their electricity consumption and expenditures. Other improvements, mainly related to electricity use in homes and commercial buildings, have been driven by federal and state policies. Examples of policies at the federal level include energy efficiency standards for appliances and lighting equipment.
States, which regulate electricity distribution service through public utility commissions and other entities, have in some cases encouraged or mandated regulated utilities to provide energy efficiency programs for their customers. These programs may, for example, provide households and businesses with energy audits and significant rebates for the purchase of more efficient equipment. Some states have adopted more stringent building energy codes that can reduce the amount of energy needed for heating, cooling, and other purposes. Although efficiency policies have primarily focused on electricity use in the residential and commercial sectors, the slowing of electricity sales growth over the past decade is dominated by declining electricity sales to industry, which mainly reflect economic factors.

Residential. Electricity sales to the residential sector accounted for 37.7% of all retail electricity sales between 2007 and 2015. Weather-related electricity demand for home heating and cooling is often the largest factor in year-over-year changes, while energy efficiency improvements and structural changes in the housing sector affect long-term trends. The 2008–09 recession slowed new-household formation and resulting electricity demand. Shifts in population and changes in housing square footage and type (i.e., from single-family homes to apartments) have an effect on residential electricity use. The continued population shift to the South and West has implications for space heating, as electricity is a more common space heating fuel in the South and West. This population shift has implications for air conditioning, as the buildings in these warmer climates require more cooling. Standards such as the lighting standards to phase out incandescent bulbs during the 2012–14 time period decreased residential demand for electricity.
Commercial. Growth in sales of power to commercial buildings averaged 1.1% annually over 2000–2015 and accounted for 36.5% of retail electricity use in 2015, up from a 35.6% sales share in 2007. Similar to the residential sector, annual fluctuations in commercial sector electricity demand are affected by weather patterns and the corresponding energy needs for heating and cooling. Standards to improve efficiency for major end uses such as lighting and space conditioning equipment have helped to moderate growing commercial building energy demand as electricity demanded for ventilation and data center servers has increased. The commercial sector contains a much more diverse group of equipment compared to the residential sector. The U.S. Department of Energy has expanded coverage of commercial-sector equipment, adding appliance standards for commercial ice makers, vending machines, pre-rinse spray valves, and commercial refrigeration equipment, among other products.
Industrial. Electricity sales to industry decreased at an annual average rate of 0.7% over 2000–2015, as the sector's share of total retail electricity sales fell from 31.2% to 25.8%. Electricity use in the industrial sector has historically been sensitive to economic conditions as the industry responds to changing demand for goods. The sector experienced a 9.1% year-over-year decrease in electricity use in 2009, during the 2008–09 recession, and electricity sales have declined at an annual rate of 0.9% from their peak in 2007 to 2015. Electricity-intensive industries have grown at about the same pace as the rest of the industrial sector, and efficiency improvements in these industries have contributed to declining electricity sales to industry.

Why didn't Brahms write a cello concerto? This is his cello concerto, says Principal Cello Hai-Ye Ni, who grabs the spotlight in the virtuosic opening cadenza. The bold and soaring "Double" Concerto is one of Brahms's most popular works. How do these two Philadelphia Orchestra virtuosos describe it? A big, monumental work that's "also like chamber music," says Ni. "The solo parts are difficult. The orchestra parts are difficult," adds Kim. "It is really hard!" (And not performed by the Orchestra on subscription concerts in nearly 20 years!) Strauss's tone poems are also great showpieces for this orchestra, and Don Juan--with its oboe solos, sonorous horns, and heralding trumpets--is no exception. Mozart's exuberant early Symphony No. 29 (written at age 18) lays the groundwork for this German-Austrian tableau.
News Crows 2, Eagles 1: Minneapolis City Grinds Out Victory in Home Debut by Kyle Eliason on 28 May 2016
MINNEAPOLIS
Minneapolis City broke a 1-1 first-half tie, scoring in the 75th minute from the penalty spot to record a victory in its home debut. Forward Matthew Gweh scored City's first-ever competitive goal in the 9th minute, and also played a hand in City's second.
Starting XIs
The introduction of holding midfielder A.J. Albers allowed City head coach Keith Kiecker to return to his preferred 4-3-3. Matt Elder started his second-straight match in goal for the Crows. Fullbacks Aaron Olson and Abdallah Bah flanked captain Trey Behart and Nate Engel, comprising the Crows' back four. In midfield, Albers sat in front of defense, allowing Max Stiegwardt and Samuel Ruiz Plaza to play further up the pitch. Gweh and Isaac “Goose” Friendt started on the wings, with Andy Lorei operating as the center forward.
The visiting Croatian Eagles used Ante Cop in goal, and also played with a back four, lining up Aaron Schroeder, Ryan Reid, Cheikh Drame and Alex Tozer from left to right. Joseph Anderson and Boubacar Sylla formed the base of a midfield triangle with Amilcar Harerra at its point. Wingers Brandon Chmiel and Diego Bobadilla flanked striker Andrew Wiedabach.
The skies above Minneapolis opened up 30 minutes prior to gametime, and while the rain lightened up around kickoff, precipitation continued to fall well into the second half. Rain earlier in the week had prevented South High School's grounds crew from mowing a field that was last tended to on Wednesday, and the length of the grass made for a very slow playing surface.
First Half
Right from the start, there was a stark contrast in each team's style of play, with the Eagles playing very direct, and the Crows looking to keep the ball on the ground. Given the wet, yet slow playing conditions, that should have favored the Eagles. However, the triangle of Benhart, Engel and Albers proved more than up to the challenge of turning back longball after longball played through the air.
Oddly, and in spite of a concerted effort to play the ball through the Eagles' lines on the ground, City's first-ever competitive goal would come through the air. The Crows were awarded a free kick near the middle of the field, 30 yards out from the Eagles' goal. The resulting kick was sent in the direction of Albers, who headed the ball on towards Gweh, who headed the ball into the back of the net.
“On that play, I was thinking of not going up, but I thought, ‘Why not?'” said Gweh. “I made a run through, A.J. headed the ball across, and I happened to be there.”
City almost doubled its lead off a second combination of headers in the 25th minute, with targetman Lorei flicking a ball through traffic in the 18-yard box in the direction of Albers. Unfortunately for CIty, Albers' effort struck a surprised Cop before the Eagles' keeper collected the ball.
The Eagles would hit back in the 31st minute, when Hererra played the ball around Engel, putting Wiedabach through on goal. Elder seemed to hesitate, considering coming out for the ball, but decided to stay in his box. A moment later Wiedabach finished low to Elder's right to tie the match.
Another scoring chance came in the 39th minute when, through a fair amount of traffic in City's 18-yard box, the ball fell to Wiedabach. Sliding for the ball, the forward was only able to fire into the goal's side netting.
The first half ended an even affair, though it was obvious the conditions were working against a smaller, more technical Crows side.
Second Half
The second half began in similar fashion, with the Croatian Eagles content to play long and direct, and not having much success besting Benhart, Engel and Albers in the air. Meanwhile, a number of City counterattacks stalled in the long grass.
In the 59th minute, Lorei found himself in an offside position on the end of a City attack, but wisely let the ball pass him by. An alert Gweh was able to run the ball down, beat his man cutting into the box, and threaten the Eagles' goal. However, by the time the play had developed, there was too much traffic in front of the net, and Gweh's shot was unable to make its way through.
The Eagles looked like they may take their first lead of the match in the 62nd minute, as a Crows' turnover led to the visitors gaining numbers on the counter. The Eagles worked the ball out wide, playing a low driven cross, but Elder was able to come off his post, dive and hold. The alert play stranded a pair of Eagles at the far post.
With Will Kidd replacing Lorei, Kidd took up on the wing and Gweh shifted into the middle of City's forward line. The change would prove fortuitous for City.
The Crows began a counter by playing the ball long to Gweh. Exercising patience, Gweh was able to shield the ball from his mark, allowing Friendt time to run past him down City's right flank. Gweh's through-ball hit a streaking Friendt in stride. Friendt was able to use his pace to drive the ball into the box, where after beating his mark off the dribble, he was taken down, winning a penalty for City.
Stiegwardt stepped up and calmly finished low and to his right to put City ahead in the 75th minute.
“I am a center forward,” Gweh stated postmatch. “When Andy ran out of gas, I slid over. Goose made a great run, and I was happy to slide the ball through for him.”
City had retaken the lead, but still needed to see off a late pair of Eagles chances to seal victory.
In the 88th minute, second-half substitute Tenzin Rampa got the better of a challenge along the endline, then flashed a driven cross past the mouth of City's goal. Unfortunately for the Eagles, they had no one waiting at the back post.
Then, in the 93rd minute, Rampa decided to take matters into his own hands, letting fly with an effort from just beyond the arc. The strike sailed over Elder's crossbar, and moments later the final whistle was blown.
Reactions
The win was an important one for City. It kept the Crows in good stead near the top of the West Division standings, and gave fans in the Twin Cities three points to celebrate. Perhaps more impressively, it showed that one of the smaller and more technical sides in the Premier League of America could grind out a result when needed.
Aside from a single lapse in the first half, the Crows' defense was solid. Bah turned in a memorable defensive performance on the right flank, and the triangle of Behart, Engel and Albers won nearly every aerial duel they contested.
When asked about how easy it was to settle in with his new teammates, having returned to Minnesota after graduating from college on Saturday, Albers said, “I know a lot of our players from [Minnesota Thunder Academy], and a lot of our players from last year [with Stegman's Internationals]. It was nice to get in, and see what the system is like.”
On the defensive performance turned in by his centerbacks and himself, Albers added, “We're ball-hungry. [The Eagles] playing it into us played to our advantage.”
Kiecker was even more bullish on his team's performance. “The field conditions and the weather conditions were a little depressing, but the guys figured out a way to win. On a bigger field, on a flat surface, that's a 5-0 win for us.” Kiecker continued, “We gave them opportunities at times, but once we got the ball down and played, we were a much better team. Goose destroyed anyone he came up against. Matthew Gweh came alive today. Albers was a beast in the middle.”
Turning his attention to next week's Twin Cities Derby against Minnesota United Reserves, Kiecker said, “They don't use college players, so I think that's a huge advantage for us. A lot of our guys have been playing together since February, and the college guys who have come back are fit. I think we're just scratching the surface on what we can do. It will be a tough match because it is a derby, but talent-wise I don't think they match up.”
Soccer fans in Minnesota can see Minneapolis City host Minnesota United Reserves on June 3rd, at 6:35 PM at South High School's Les Barnard Field.

On Fox News Sunday, Karl Rove asserted of Sen. Barack Obama facing questions about the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan: "Now, having ties to Louis Farrakhan and his anti-Semitic comments, that's -- that's -- you know, people have a reason -- that's a reasonable question: Do you agree with him? Do you renounce him? Do you reject him?" In fact, Obama has denied that his campaign has "ties to" Farrakhan and has answered the questions posed by Rove, having repeatedly denounced Farrakhan's anti-Semitic statements.
On the March 2 edition of Fox News Sunday, Fox News contributor and former White House senior political adviser Karl Rove asserted of Sen. Barack Obama facing questions about Nation of Islam founder Louis Farrakhan: "Now, having ties to Louis Farrakhan and his anti-Semitic comments, that's -- that's -- you know, people have a reason -- that's a reasonable question: Do you agree with him? Do you renounce him? Do you reject him?" However, neither Rove nor host Chris Wallace noted that Obama has denied that his campaign has "ties to" Farrakhan or that he has answered the questions posed by Rove, having repeatedly and consistently denounced Farrakhan's anti-Semitic statements. Indeed, during the February 26 Democratic primary debate, Obama began his first answer on the subject of Farrakhan by saying: "You know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support." Obama added "we're not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan." Obama also said during questioning about Farrakhan in the debate: "There's no formal offer of help from Minister Farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it. But if the word 'reject' Senator Clinton feels is stronger than the word 'denounce,' then I'm happy to concede the point, and I would reject and denounce."
Later in the program, Fox News Washington managing editor Brit Hume said, referring to the debate, that "Obama was then -- was asked to either accept or reject the endorsement of this man who said such hateful things. And after some dispute between him and Clinton, he said he denounced his racial comments." In fact, Obama's statements that "I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments" and that "I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible" came before Clinton spoke on the subject. Additionally, Obama denounced Farrakhan's anti-Semitism in January when Trumpet Newsmagazine, a publication founded by Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ, where Obama is a parishioner, awarded Farrakhan the "Lifetime Achievement 'Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. Trumpeter Award'." Obama issued a statement in which he said: "I decry racism and anti-Semitism in every form and strongly condemn the anti-Semitic statements made by Minister Farrakhan. I assume that Trumpet Magazine made its own decision to honor Farrakhan based on his efforts to rehabilitate ex-offenders, but it is not a decision with which I agree."
Obama also said during a February 24 speech just two days before the debate, "I have been a consistent, before I go any further, a consistent denunciator of Louis Farrakhan, nobody challenges that."
From the March 2 edition of Fox Broadcasting Co.'s Fox News Sunday:
Presidential candidates won't be done debating in Las Vegas after Tuesday.
His training of how to debate at a podium has, apparently, been limited to advisers telling him that "it will be a little different standing up to sitting down" like he did in Vermont.
Sanders may not plan on attacking Clinton's record, but for O'Malley - who garnered just one percent of the vote in the NBC/WSJ poll - making a name for himself entails doing just that. Bernie Sanders, an opportunity to brand her as a flip-flopper on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate. "I hope this [rally] will excite the Latino population", said Justin Enriquez, the band's director. According to a USA Today poll released October 1, Clinton leads with 41 percent to 23 percent for Sanders and 20 percent for Biden.
Many people in the crowd seemed confident that Sanders can keep this sort of excitement and momentum all the way to the primary election, and even the White House.
A number of factors explain why. When Tim Russert, one of the moderators, tried to determine whether she was in favor of issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants she had indicated both yes and no she called his question a "gotcha". Christopher Stevens and three associates in Benghazi, Libya.
Her campaign has also at times appeared ham-handed: It paradoxically revealed, for example, that Clinton was planning to become more spontaneous - earning her more than a few snickers and barbs.
Clinton voted for the Patriot Act in 2001 as a US senator. Nor has she succeeded in drawing a clear picture of how her administration would distinguish itself from that of her husband, Bill Clinton, or President Obama, for whom she served as secretary of state. Video clips of Clinton talking about the trade deal are stored on YouTube, giving her opponents made-for-TV footage that could be used in television ads to highlight her shifting positions.
There's a little evidence Clinton's Hillary-first advertising strategy has helped her earn prospective voters' admiration as she attempts to re- re- re- reintroduce herself to a body politic already well-acquainted with her decades-long political career. The progressive populist wing of the Democratic Party that tried It's damndest to draft Elizabeth Warren for 2016 has been more than willing to settle for Sanders as its standard-bearer. "She's also trying to prove to the public that she's not a hologram, that she has a dimension".
Clinton has not ruled out super-PAC money and is benefiting from at least two working primarily on her behalf, Priorities USA Action, and American Bridge 21st Century. Arturo Carmona, the campaign's newly appointed Latino outreach coordinator, said that Sanders' unpopularity among Hispanic voters has a positive side in a way that they can use it to shape his image to one that appeals to the demographic.
As a Democrat who believes strongly in finding ways to reduce gun violence, I am listening closely to the presidential candidates, especially in the wake of what happened in Oregon.
According to David Smith, assistant professor of political science and Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, don't expect to see Vice President Joe Biden on the stage.
Sanders introduced legislation in July to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"She's a very good debater".
The news of the week in Washington may be House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's dropped speakership bid, but he is not the only one turning heads. Southern Nevada's housing market was the hardest hit in the USA when the economy tanked in 2008.
After the Sixers' 130-111 victory over the Orlando Magic on Saturday, J.J. Redick was being asked a question in the locker room when he was informed about something that his running mate in the starting backcourt on this night had said only a few minutes before.
T.J. said that you're the best shooter he's ever played with …
“He hasn't played with many great shooters,” Redick pointed out, unimpressed by the designation. “No offense, but …”
But that was obvious as soon as Redick, who will go down as all-time great from beyond the arc, put pen to paper on the one-year, $23 million contract this summer. After finishing 24th in team three-point percentage the first two seasons of T.J. McConnell's career, the Sixers signed Redick to improve on that number while also aiding Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid's efforts to bring the overall offense out of the basement.
Redick was, in his own words, “fairly outspoken about his...

Community Development Block Grant Funds
On December 3, 2003, the President signed into law the Tornado Shelters Act (Public Law 108-146), which amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, authorizing communities to use community development block grant funds to construct tornado-safe shelters in manufactured home parks. To be eligible, a shelter must be located in a neighborhood or park that contains at least 20 units, consists predominately of low- and moderate-income households and is in a state where a tornado has occurred within the current year or last three years. The shelter must comply with tornado-appropriate safety and construction standards, be large enough to accommodate all members of the park/neighborhood and be located in a park/neighborhood that has a warning siren. Community development block grant funds are funded through HUD.
FHA Mortgage Insured Financing
On January 14, 2000, as part of The Housing and Urban Development (HUD)/ The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA's) continuing efforts to be responsive to public safety concerns, HUD began allowing borrowers to include windstorm shelters as an eligible work item for FHA 203(k) rehabilitation loans and FHA 203(b) financed new construction (see HUD Disaster Recovery Assistance). Shelters financed with FHA-insured mortgages must be constructed consistent with the guidelines presented in FEMA P-320, Taking Shelter from the Storm: Building a Safe Room for Your Home or Small Business.
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program Funds
FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) assists states and local communities in implementing long-term hazard mitigation measures following a major disaster declaration. As of November 1, 2004, all communities must have an approved hazard mitigation plan in place to remain eligible for HMGP funding. HMGP grants can be used to fund projects that provide protection to both public and private properties. Projects that are eligible under the HMGP grant include (but are not limited to) acquiring and demolishing or relocating structures from hazard-prone areas; retrofitting structures to protect them from floods, high winds, earthquakes or other natural hazards and constructing residential and community shelters in tornado-prone areas.
FEMA can fund up to 75 percent of the eligible costs of each project. The state or local match does not have to be cash; in-kind services or materials may be used. Federal funding under the HMGP is based on 7.5 percent of the federal funds spent on the Public and Individual Assistance programs (minus administrative expenses) for each disaster. Eligible applicants must apply for the HMGP through the State Hazard Mitigation Officer (See the HMGP main page).
Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program Funds
FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Funds provide both planning and project funding to eligible communities. Communities must complete an approved hazard mitigation plan by November 1, 2004, to remain eligible for PDM funds. PDM project funding is nationally competitive; there is no "base" amount guaranteed to each state. A national priority is placed on projects that address National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) repetitive loss properties and a benefit cost analysis is required for each proposed project. Projects are awarded priority based on the state's analysis and resulting ranking and on factors such as cost-effectiveness, addressing critical facilities and the percent of the population that benefits from the project. FEMA funds up to 75 percent of the cost of the project or up to 90 percent for small, impoverished communities. There is a $3 million cap on the federal share of the cost per project (See the PDM main page).

A Westfield man has been given probation after allegedly violating state wiretap law by secretly recording a police officer during a traffic stop.
Shaun Hitchcock, 26, admitted to sufficient facts on an illegal wiretap charge in Westfield District Court Wednesday. As part of the plea, which is not an admission of guilt, his case was continued without a finding for three months; should he complete probation without incident, the charges will be dropped.
On Jan. 9, Westfield Police Officer Frank Soleimani stopped Hitchcock for speeding. Hitchcock secretly recorded the encounter with his cell phone, according to Soleimani's statement of fact.
"The defendant had discreetly placed his cell phone somewhere down by his side, out of plain view," Soleimani wrote. "The defendant did not tell me that he was audio recording my conversation with him from the beginning."
At the end of the traffic stop, Hitchcock told the officer he had recorded the conversation, Soleimani reported. Hitchcock later posted the recording on his Facebook page, according to Soleimani's report. Soleimani acquired a copy of the recording, and Hitchcock was charged with illegal wiretapping on Jan. 20.
Soleimani is no longer with the department, having left in May to take a job with the state environmental police, Westfield Police Chief John Camerota said.
The case is the latest example of conflict between Massachusetts' strict wiretapping law and the growing trend, fueled by social media and the ubiquity of smartphones, to record police as they conduct their official duties.
A federal appeals court has found a First Amendment right to record police activity in Massachusetts, but only if the recording is done openly. Unlike many states and federal law, Massachusetts requires two-party consent to record conversations - meaning that everyone involved in an exchange needs to have a reasonable expectation of being recorded to avoid violating state wiretap law.
In terms of recording in public, including the actions of police officers, state courts have found that recording is allowed as long as the device is not concealed. In the 2007 case of Commonwealth v. Manzelli, a state appeals court upheld the conviction of a man convicted of secretly recording police officers while at a public political rally. A Chicopee woman, Karen Dziewit, was charged with secretly recording her arrest by concealing her phone in her purse last year, though that charge was later dropped.
In a similar 2001 case, the state's Supreme Judicial Court upheld the conviction of Michael Hyde, a motorist who secretly recorded Abingdon police officers during a traffic stop.
YouTube Live, a livestreaming feature that the video giant is gradually rolling out to all creators, has experienced enormous user growth over the past five months, according to a report by Streamlabs, far outpacing that of category leader Twitch.
According to Streamlabs, a popular tool used by broadcasters to optimize streams and incomes, the total number of monthly active broadcasters grew 330% for YouTube Live over the past five months, compared with 19% on Twitch. Over the past six weeks, those growth rates were 36.6% and 4.1% for YouTube Live and Twitch, respectively. And, in the past month, YouTube Live added 8,331 new streamers while Twitch added 3,363.
“If these growth rates continue at the same rate, we expect YouTube Live will be as large as Twitch in the next 18 to 24 months,” Streamlabs writes in its latest quarterly report. Check out a breakdown of growth in monthly active users since October below:
When it comes to monetization, however, Twitch still trumps YouTube Live by leaps and bounds — at least according to the tips processed by Streamlabs. The company says that Twitch generated 96% of all tips last quarter, as opposed to the 4% generated by YouTube Live. All told, tips are up 13% over last quarter, according to Streamlabs, from $20.8 million in Q4 2016 to $23.5 million in Q1 2017.
Perhaps most interestingly, per Streamlabs, is the fact that spending by veteran viewers — those who have been watching singed up for a service for at least two years — is 253% higher than spend by viewers who have only been signed up for less than 3 months. Streamlabs notes that it didn't expect the disparity to be this huge, and that it “shows that livestreaming is a long-term entertainment medium with tremendous potential.”

Shadow transport minister Mary Creagh has prioritised better and safer road infrastructure for cyclists in her party's 2015 manifesto.
Speaking to the Guardian's Public Leaders Network, she said: “Getting a cycle safety audit into the mainstream of transport planning is very high on our agenda for the next manifesto so that cyclists and pedestrians are not added in as afterthoughts but planned in from the start.”
Ms Creagh's characterisation of current cycling provision as an afterthought is in line with much of the criticism of London's Cycle Superhighways.
Cycle Superhighway 2 has been a particular target for criticism after the deaths of several cyclists on or near it. The non-segregated bike lane's purpose was to allay some of the fears for cyclist safety in the capital, instead it has been a focal point for anger over recent cyclist deaths in the city.
Creagh believes that we are now paying the price for cutting 130,000 jobs in the construction sector and reducing the funding for our roads since the last general election.
“Those people [whose jobs were cut] could have been kept on, and infrastructure and maintenance could have been done over the last three years," she said. "We always said the government had cut too far too fast and a lot of that is being played out now in the degradation of our roads infrastructure.”
Creagh, who is a cyclist herself and cycled from London to Brighton for charity before the Labour Party conference in September, considers the poorly distributed cuts the reason for UK's World Economic Forum rank of 28 in the infrastructure standings.
Referring to the poor ranking, Creagh said: "That's a bad place to be, our country is crying out for infrastructure spending."
Aéropostale Inc. is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection this week and close more than 100 stores, according to people familiar with the matter, as the teen-apparel retailer contends with mounting losses and falling sales.
New York-based Aéropostale plans to seek chapter 11 protection in the next few days before May rent payments are due, the people said. It is in advanced talks with specialty lender Crystal Financial LLC on a loan to finance its operations in bankruptcy, they added.
The retailer would close more than 100 of its roughly 800 stores soon after filing and potentially more later, the people said. The company plans to reorganize around its remaining stores, but the precise contours of its restructuring plan remain unclear, they added.
A number of mall-based specialty retailers have filed for bankruptcy in recent years as declining mall traffic, changing consumer tastes and competition from "fast-fashion" chains like Hennes & Mauritz AB and Fast Retailing Co.'s Uniqlo eat into their sales.
Teen retailer Pacific Sunwear of California Inc., known as PacSun, sought bankruptcy last month, citing the "shifting retail landscape." In 2015, women's formalwear retailer Cache Inc., teen-focused Wet Seal and surfwear seller Quiksilver Inc. filed for chapter 11 protection.

If it bleeds, it leads – that most reliable axiom of journalism – may be nowhere as true as on Twitter. War, natural disasters, sudden violence, and their confusion, certainly get an immediate, spontaneous, and vivid expression in a tweet roll.
Andy Carvin, a social media promoter, gained lots of attention for himself, and for Twitter's usefulness in fraught circumstances, during the successive convulsions of the Arab spring. It was largely his focus on personal stories, on individual pain and terror, that made his obsessive tweeting compelling, and that form the basis of his just-published book, Distant Witness: Social Media, the Arab Spring and a Journalism Revolution. "Unflinching, real-time depiction of conflict" is Carvin's metier, according to the book's press notes.
[Carvin] is reinventing how people experience the news. No longer merely consuming it, they participate in it, interacting with the very people on the ground engaged in the uprisings.
Late last week, Carvin applied his you-are-there, or I-am-there-in-spirit, tweeting approach to the school shooting in Connecticut, not just noting each raw increment of the unfolding story, but adjudicating on, and frequently scolding, the rest of the media's confused accounts. From a remote control booth, Carvin uses Twitter as a field walkie-talkie calling out to others, and then centralizing their reports. In theory, he's harnessing the eyes and ears of people actually on the ground, in sight of the carnage, and, as it were, disintermediating the outside cameras and hacks yet to arrived – or who might not ever arrive (aka parachuting reporters).
This is "crowdsourcing", that new notion of information collection and retrieval that has become a cliche even before its actual process has been much tested or entirely defined. Carvin is certainly a bona fide practitioner of a new form of journalism, inventing a role for himself that seems as native as the network anchorman became to television in the 1960s. (Carvin even has his own signature signoff before he stops tweeting for the night: "Stay safe, everyone.")
This successfully assumed identity seems to have compelled his employer, NPR, quite a traditional news organization, to have acknowledged his special standing with the awkward title, "senior product manager for online communities". As it happens, and perhaps the awkwardness of his title reflects NPR's discomfort here, Carvin himself has no journalism or reporting experience. He was a not-for-profit administrator involved with digital issues, primarily how to expand public computing resources to those without, when he started to focus on computing's role in mass events – a good way to promote the importance of computers for all.
Carvin's interest has never been reporting, per se, or storytelling, or even, in the manner of the untrained war reporter, experiencing the reality for himself. Rather, his vocation, along with promoting social media itself, has been that new information role called "curation" – another cliche even before being adequately defined – which has somehow become an uber form of editing.
Carvin's elevation to sacred cow and groundbreaking auteur in the new news media has strongly benefited from the digital establishment's instant and militant defense of its own, and the old media establishment's ambivalence about itself. Indeed, Carvin has what seems like a personal publicist in the technology writer, Matthew Ingram, who often tweets and writes about Carvin's significance, going so far as to say he ought to win a Pulitzer prize for tweeting. Likewise, Carvin has become a constant and scornful disciplinarian of the news media that does win Pulitzer prizes – and, more often than not, is praised, courted, and quoted by that media.
When the details of the shooting first started to emerge last Friday morning, Carvin quickly moved to insert himself as the grandmaster tweeter, consolidating, parsing, weighing the other tweets in his wide purview. His talent is not just speed but centrality: he assumes a striking intimacy with the event at hand.
He quickly became bathed in Newtown's drama, proudly explaining during Friday's marathon tweeting session that CNN had called to try to get him on the air, thinking he was at the scene rather than in Washington, DC. (He noted, from his 300-mile distance from the event: "Just called home. Never been so relieved to hear my son's voice in the background.")
He also became, on Friday morning, a fevered spreader of misinformation.
While claiming not to retweet most of what he finds, because of its questionable provenance, he nevertheless tweeted a rather broad range of bollocks. There was news of a mysterious purple van that does not seem actually have existed. Then there was, suddenly, a second shooter theory that got Carvin's attention. And the gunman's brother found dead. And two bodies at the mother's house. And he piled on to the fake letter moment – retweeting reports about a letter supposedly written by a child from inside the school.
While the guise is to retweet in order to verify, the effect is to propagate.
Carvin's defender, Ingram, had to rush into the fray with a blog saying that this is how news works: misinformation emerges. But fortunately, there are people like Carvin, practicing social media, to sort it out.
Part of the background noise to Carvin's incessant tweeting is Carvin defending his "method", and complaining about being the wounded party: "Looks like another occasion for MSM to blame social for spreading rumors when many of the rumors spread to social *from* MSM."
It is this self-righteousness, and claim of moral stature, that, more than the technology, may give him his leeway and license – and voice. By virtue of his immersion in social media, he identifies with suffering more than people who see the world through traditional media. Through social media, he shares the pain.
He's the empathy king. He feels everything ("First thing I did at restaurant tonight: identify exits, hiding places, and objects that could be used to fight back"), and it is unbearable ("I just wonder how many others are having weird flashbacks that combine Arab Spring violence with yesterday's shooting," he says a day after the mayhem).
And he doesn't go away, he keeps tweeting and keeps feeling ("unflinching", according to his publicist), vastly more than the heartless cynics and professional snobs of nonsocial and nonparticipatory media ("Putting away phone. Gonna go sit in my kids' rooms for a while – just to reflect on today. You should do the same with yours. Stay safe.")
The new journalism, it turns out, is every bit as self-dramatizing as the old.
• Andy Carvin has responded below, with an edited version of his long-form reply to Michael Wolff's article
By Bailey Shoemaker Richards
The recent trend in “manvertisement” (candles – only for men! Dr Pepper Ten's “it's not for women!” debacle, granola cereals – also only for men! And so on, and on) has been covered extensively already, but it's something that deserves another look. Recently, “Dudepins” was announced: it's the man's alternative to Pinterest. The website, when you look it up, tells you “Man Up. Sign Up. Pin Up.” The connotations of this are obvious: Pinterest is for lady things – man up. Get an invite, and then look at all the pictures of pin-up ladies.
I'm grossed out by this trend for a number of reasons. Dudepins was the final nail in the gender essentialist coffin for me. The femmephobia ingrained in someone's apparent need to create this website – because Pinterest is for girls, ew – is unfortunate. It reflects an irritating cultural moment where advertisers feel the need to aggressively hawk a certain species of masculinity that is harmful to everyone.
Femmephobia, for those not familiar, is the fear of the feminine; it often contains a sense of loathing, as well. While people who are femmephobic, specifically the hyper-masculine demographic Dudepins and manvertisement seeks to court, may covet the delicate charms of a narrow subset of women (thin, white, ultra-feminine), that same femininity is also seen as something weak, other and bad – it is a threat to the masculine.
Men, according to manvertisements, must be violent, dirty, power-hungry, buff, rough, rude and strong. Anything other than that and you are in the realm of femininity, which is unacceptable, because to be like a woman is to be less than a man in the eyes of Dudepins and their ilk. The front page of the Dudepins website, for example, is plastered with pictures of cars, pool tables, wrestlers, meat and alcohol, and occasionally a scantily clad woman.
It is designed to look like the exact opposite of their impression of Pinterest, the front page of which is plastered with recipes, fashion pictures, cute quotes, scooters, interior decoration and wedding shots. The division could not be clearer – but it's not like men can't use Pinterest to further their defense of manliness already: there are numerous boards of things men want their girlfriends or wives to cook or wear.
Dudepins, man-candles and other aggressively masculine products aren't only targeting a certain demographic of tough-guy, though. They are also upholding a definition of masculinity that is dangerous and damaging, even to the supposed toughest of guys, with their adorable pins of cars and booze in their own steroid-filled online man-caves.
For starters, this definition of masculinity reflects a deep gender-binary division: if men are rough, women must be soft and gentle. If men are the stoic types, women must be over-sharers and chatty. If men are the rowdy wrestlers and players of pool, women's interests must be quieter – embroidery, maybe, or planning a wedding. There is no room for overlap.
This is dangerous because it puts people in boxes that it can be very difficult to get out of: men are told they must never share their emotions (that's for ladies), and this leads to depression, anger issues, damaged relationships. Gay men, and men who are more feminine, are at risk of homophobic attacks, both verbal and physical. Women who like pool, power tools and muscle cars are scolded on a number of fronts: they just want attention from men, they don't really know how an engine works; women aren't good at physical stuff, they're weak; women can't like whiskey and action movies, those are only for guys – but they're still a little cooler than girly girls, who are catty and mean, of course. This type of attack comes from both men and women, and also includes the risk of physical attack.
The message of manvertising is that women are less than men. Men who are like women are less than men. Only straight manly men count. Femininity is bad and must be avoided, unless you're objectifying a thin woman. The manly man is shown as both the norm and the pinnacle of achievement. There is no place in the world of Dudepins vs. Pinterest for men who like lace and women who like power tools – these are anomalies that must be crushed and stamped out.
This is ludicrously unhealthy. There's nothing inherently wrong with pool, whiskey, and fast cars – the problem enters when those neutral objects get tied up with reductive ideas of what it means to be a man, and posited as markers of the only acceptable way to be manly. Defining gendered behavior and appearance in such a narrow way makes true expression impossible: it is entirely feasible that a man who likes Call of Duty can also like tasteful interior decorating. It is entirely feasible that a woman who likes skirts and high heels can also mountain climb, hike, hunt and camp with the toughest of outdoorsmen.
Reducing the categories of “men” and “women” to strictly delineated camps of masculinity and femininity, and setting them at war with one another, denies the exciting and complicated relationships of human behavior and interest. Reducing people to the most basic concepts of gender erases complex gender identity and puts people at risk of homophobic and transphobic violence. Denying that there is any overlap of masculinity and femininity prevents people from safely exploring their interests, and makes it harder to build deep and interesting connections with one another.
Segmenting people along a gender division that says women must exist to be soft, passive objects for the admiration of tough, dirty, drunk guys reinforces a lot of very ugly messages about how advertisers expect us to behave, look and act. My challenge to you is to defy those messages with your authentic self. Remind people and companies that there is more than one way to express your masculinity and femininity, and that these categories can exist in the same place, in the same person, in compelling and real ways.
Located above the Dizengoff shopping center, this urban farm uses hydroponics to grow vegetables rapidly and organically.
The Dizengoff Center is a vast shopping mall in central Tel Aviv, Israel. Built in the 1970s, the towering concrete structure doesn't look like much, but when you step inside, a wonderful sight will meet your eyes.
There is a vegetable stand just inside the door, built of wood and packed with bags of fresh, wet leafy greens and herbs. It is an anomaly in the midst of fast-fashion outlets and food courts, better suited for a traditional farmers' market, but this humble little vegetable stand has become a great success. It relies on the honor system, trusting shoppers to leave the correct change and take what they want. (Eighty percent of shoppers do so.) The vegetables sell out so quickly that the stand has to be restocked four times daily.

What makes these vegetables really special, though, is that they're grown on the roof of the Dizengoff shopping center. As part of a project called ‘Green in the City,' or Yarok Bair in Hebrew, an urban rooftop farm has been established over the past year. It comprises two commercial greenhouses, totaling 750 square meters (over 8,000 square feet) of growing space, as well as an educational area where citizens can learn urban farming techniques and cooking skills relevant to the vegetables they grow. The organization sells hydroponics units for home use and teaches people how to use them.

The rooftop farm produces 10,000 heads of lettuce per month year-round, and grows 17 different varieties of greens and herbs; there is even a banana tree. The farm uses a variety of hydroponics systems – some vertical, some horizontal – that grow food two times faster than in soil. The system does not require regular cleaning, since the sun does not access the water beneath the plastic covers that hold the plants, and the constant flow of oxygen prevents rot.

The vegetables are grown without pesticides, although they do not qualify for official organic certification because of a line in Israeli agricultural laws that states that organic food must be grown in soil.
Lavi Kushelevich, who works for Green in the City, is a passionate advocate for reclaiming one's food system. He believes that this rooftop farm – only one of 15 urban farming initiatives that he's currently overseeing in Israel – can help urban Millennials to get excited about growing their own food, without having to move to the rural farms, or kibbutzim, that attracted previous generations.
I visited on a rainy December morning, along with a group of fellow environmental writers. Lavi took us on a tour of the rooftop, pointing out other interesting sustainability initiatives started by the Dizengoff Center. These include a tree-planting program, where children from Tel Aviv come on the national holiday of Tu BishVat to plant seedlings. Later, the young trees are planted around the city and the Dizengoff Center receives carbon credits for its efforts.

There are beehives, too, though the honey is left undisturbed, and a bat cave in the lower levels of the basement. Birds' nests are placed on the rooftop to encourage avian visitors.
It's really amazing to see how a shopping center – such a symbol of modern consumerism – has been converted into a farm, creating access to fresh food for thousands of urban residents. The leafy greenhouses, a refreshing counterpoint to the shops below, are proof that nutritious ingredients can be accessible to all, even in the most unexpected places. All it takes is some innovative thinking, and Israel certainly has plenty of that.

Last night's episode, "Platonish," wasn't the first to coin a new phrase
You won't find the title of last night's episode of How I Met Your Mother in the dictionary — but the doesn't mean it's not a specific word for a specific thing. The neologism, Platonish, perfectly sums up that not-quite-platonic relationship status…a status that, if you ask Barney, is true of every single male-female pair of friends who are both single (with one exception).
But platonish isn't the sitcom's first foray into the land of the lexicon. The show has a long history of coining words, phrases and concepts. Many of the larger, recurring concepts — the Slap Bet, the Vicky Mendoza Diagonal and the hot/crazy scale, the Bro Code… — have successfully infiltrated pop culture, but the writers also have a knack for turning a smaller phrase and coining new words. Like:
The possimpible
Episode: “The Possimpible,” probably the show's best single-episode contribution of new words
Definition: That which is beyond the impossible, at the place where the possible and the impossible meet. The episode's focus on business also produced jargon like connectitude, transformatation and linkativity—and…
Insanulous
Episode: “The Possimpible”
Definition: Insane + ridiculous. (Various spellings accepted.)
Revertigo
Episode: “Sandcastles In The Sand”
Definition: The change that happens to someone's personality when he or she spends time with someone from his or her past.
Awsful
Episode: “Benefits”
Definition: Awesome + awful; a good way to disguise accidental jubilation.
Desperation Day
Episode: “Desperation Day”
Definition: Feb. 13, the last day to find someone with whom to spend Valentine's Day
(MORE: Please Do Not Make a How I Met Your Mother Spinoff)
Woo Girls
Episode: “Woooo!”
Definition: Single women who go out in large groups and yell “wooo!” a lot—even when nothing is actually exciting them
Steak sauce
Episode: “Life Among the Gorillas”
Definition: A-1, the tops, the best, awesome.
Superdate
Episode: “Of Course”
Definition: One date that includes “17 dates-worth of romance”
DoWiSeTrePla
Episode: “Dowisetrepla”
Definition: A play on the naming of many New York City neighborhoods, this locale is Downwind of the Sewage Treatment Plant.
And then there's one that wasn't actually invited by HIMYM — it shows up on Google's Ngram viewer as early as 1859 — but gets an honorary mention for having become so associated with the show
Lawyered
Episode: several
Definition: What a lawyer says upon winning an argument

It's rare when fans of both teams celebrate a trade, but this is one time it's happened. Johnson's move to Brooklyn was hailed by Nets fans because it gave Williams a reason to stay, other than the maximum $100 million contract he was able to receive. It's also still being celebrated by Atlanta faithful who looked past Johnson's six straight All-Star berths and held him responsible for failing to get the Hawks past the second round. He became an easy target, with his max-money deal that still has four seasons left at almost $90 million.
SLAM DUNKS
NBA revenues went down by about $400 million due to the lockout-shortened, 66-game regular season. With the loss of 20% of its season following the five-month lockout, the league expected the losses after pocketing $3.8 billion in 2010-11. NBA owners left the Board of Governors meetings in Las Vegas happy in one regard: The long-awaited move of putting advertising patches on jerseys becomes official in two seasons, meaning the league is going to find a new way to fill its coffers. Deputy commissioner Adam Silver projects the ads will contribute $100 million per season, with the revenue expected to be split 50-50 between owners and players, since it will be part of the basketball-related income pool. Patches will measure two inches by two inches and will be stitched onto the jersey's shoulder.
I have been an emergency registrar approximately forever. Some people's training years form a crisp, well defined, early-adult life phase. Mine are evolving into a meandering opus.
In early 2013, awake with a newborn in the wee hours of the morning, (a highly recommended setting for major life decision making) I concocted an audacious plan to Finish My Training. Rotations, exam sittings and an interstate move all slotted in with tetris-like precision, it was brilliant in theory but too fragile for in vivo conditions. Such was the interdependency of the various elements that an unexpected delay in the completion of one component wreaked havoc upon my carefully crafted path to fellowship, in the manner of my toddler son in a newly tidied room.
Left slightly flailing, I faced the reality of further years in my prolonged medical adolescence without a clear end point upon which to anchor. If I wished to continue with emergency training, (and considering I've caught myself lying in bed reminiscing about putting a chest tube, I probably did) it was time to stop dreaming of the lush pastures on the other side of Mt FACEM, and focus on making life work just a little bit better in the here and now.
There are numerous challenges associated with trainee life; exams, forced relocations and explaining to well meaning relatives exactly why you are still studying to name a few. I will assume, however, I am with the majority when I cite the decidedly unsexy roster as the main culprit in my struggle to maintain a reasonable sense of wellbeing. It goes without saying that night shift is a hugely disruptive work pattern, but a large proportion of late finishes and the constantly rotating shifts also contribute to the difficulty in maintaining a good sleep habit. The relationship between myself and restful slumber further strained by two small people and the resulting zero-sum game of inter-spousal sleep politics, it was clear that if I could better manage my sleep around shift work, I might just rule the world.
Working out the next step in this challenge (better sleep that is, not world domination) was a little trickier. As this subject falls somewhere on the spectrum between passion and obsession for me, there was no low-hanging fruit left to tackle. Morning exercise and light exposure as natural as breathing. Blackout blinds installed. No caffeine at least eight hours before planned bedtime. No screen time the hour before bedtime (unless there's something really, really important on the internet). A nice, wind down bedtime routine. Noise cancelling headphones for sleeping. A valiant, decade long attempt to cultivate the habit of daily meditation.
This was clearly a situation best addressed by some internet shopping and a little N=1 trial. Wallet loosened by the same post night shift disinhibition that is a mixed blessing on morning handover rounds, I jumped online and made two purchases; a relatively cheap pair of blue-light blocking shades, and a long coveted item, re-timer sleep glasses.
Background
It was the light which had attracted my attention on this occasion. The role of sunlight exposure as the master puppeteer of our circadian rhythm, via the pulsed release of melatonin from the pineal gland, to be precise. Rising melatonin levels increase sleep propensity. In a “typical” sleep pattern of falling asleep at 11pm and rising at 7am (I think I did this once around 2009) melatonin release will begin around 9pm and peak approximately seven hours later, at 4am, the witching hour of the night shift worker. By 9am, our melatonin levels have fallen significantly, release further inhibited by early morning light exposure, and levels are negligible throughout the daylight hours. This makes it increasingly difficult to fall into restful sleep, our artificial sleep pattern misaligned with our internal clock.
The whole process gets even more interesting when you consider that under normal circumstances, preparation for the next night sleep actually begins upon morning waking. The reason why every article ever written on sleep quality opens with “Go to bed and get up at the same time every day” is not purely to provoke irrational stabby rage towards the authors within shift workers everywhere, but because early morning light exposure plays a crucial role in sleep physiology by pre-setting the timing for evening melatonin release.
Light exposure early in the main waking period brings forward the sleep cycle Light exposure late in the main waking period delays the sleep cycle. To summarise the relationship in 2 simple tenets: While there was enough basic science evidence to satisfy my inner skeptic, whether artificial manipulation of this process would be practical or beneficial was not so clear.
Blue light blocking shades
Financial Outlay: A large variety available online from $10 upwards.
A large variety available online from $10 upwards. Rationale : The amber lenses completely block the blue light wavelength to which the photoreceptors affecting melatonin release are most sensitive. This creates what one paper referred to poetically as a “physiological darkness”. Worn post night shift, the natural early morning inhibition of melatonin release is halted, making it easier to fall asleep in daylight hours. They can also be worn in the evening to shield artificial lights.

Use: As soon as handover finished at 8.30am I put them on to finish my notes and referrals (in the privacy of the reg office), and wore them for the drive home. They blocked glare effectively, and the tinted lenses made me feel just a little more Bono and a little less thirty something whose hobbies include wiping bench tops and folding washing. I also trialled wearing them at the tail end of a midnight finish and in the evening at home two hours before bedtime.
Re-timer sleep glasses
Financial outlay : Enough to result in a three year courtship prior to purchase.
: Enough to result in a three year courtship prior to purchase. Rationale : Developed by sleep psychologists at Flinders University, they are promoted for use for jet lag, seasonal affective disorder, shift work and sleep phase disorders. A light of the correct wavelength for maximal stimulation of the relevant photoreceptors is beamed directly onto the retina. The idea for shift workers is to promote a partial “circadian phase delay”, by delaying the usual melatonin peak by up to four hours. This shifts the highest fatigue period out of work hours, with a primary aim of improved workplace alertness rather than daytime sleep quality.

(Direct sunlight exposure is my default option here, but isn't always practical.)

I also went “off label” and tried wearing them directly upon waking at 2pm following the final nightshift with the intention of bringing the sleep phase forward. (Direct sunlight exposure is my default option here, but isn't always practical.) Surprisingly wearable, they fit easily and comfortably over glasses. I was able to eat and drink, move around and work on the computer without limitation. I eased into use by trialling them round the house, much to the delight of my children. I then bravely debuted them on the shop floor at 2am, much to the delight of the seventeen nurses who suddenly fell within my visual field, despite there NEVER being anyone there when I'm sterile, need to put in one last suture and run out of ethylon.
Re-timers aren't really suitable for direct patient contact or face to face referrals, but I quarantined a section of time for note writing, phone referrals and a snack and was able to wear them for a relatively continuous half hour, even on one particularly busy night. If a patient required urgent attention I simply took them off and replaced them upon returning to the staff base. This planned desk time probably increased my overall shift productivity and certainly highlighted the non-urgent nature of the majority of our interruptions.
The Verdict
True benefit or an expensive case of self-justification bias leading to placebo effect? Not sure, but over a couple of trial weeks which included the full complement of shift hours, I fell into sleep easily, felt refreshed on waking, and in the night shift recovery phase noticed a distinct lack of the lethargy and anhedonia I have come to expect from this period. Re-timer use also appeared to lead to a significant curtailing of the 4-5am night shift slump. Given the tendency of human behaviour to regress to the mean, it's too early to say whether the practical challenges of regular use in a hectic environment (not to mention relentless mirth from colleagues) will inhibit development of the habitual use required for meaningful, long-term outcomes.
It's worth noting, however, that any effects occurred in an environment of careful attention to my sleep pattern. So while there may well be a role for such tools in the arsenal of the “lifestyle” shift worker, there is unlikely to be any benefit without continued effort in maintaining the fundamentals I glossed over earlier. A cool, dark, quiet environment for sleep. Regulation of caffeine intake. Going to bed early when possible. A full time, live-in night nanny . Fresh air, exercise and reasonable nutrition. The boring truth is that when practiced consistently, these things work.
The moral of the story? Sleep is a little bit like sepsis. Both start with S. Importance of proper management was underestimated for many years. Trying harder is good. There probably is no magic bullet, (I'm talking to you, Xigris) but meticulous attention to doing the basics well is likely to result in better outcomes. Get it right and you might just save a life. Or even rule the world.

OK, obviously no goalie deserves anything based on a singular save. However, the stop by San Jose Sharks backup netminder Alex Stalock off of Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin on Sunday was a thing of beauty. It was one of 31 saves on 33 shots to help keep the Sharks' razor thin playoff hopes alive.
Push across, full splits, puck labeled for the top corner, and a blocker save and a beauty! The Sharks were down 2-0 at the time and a third goal would have been a backbreaker. Stalock absolutely stoning Malkin allowed San Jose to come back and tie the game 2-2 before losing in a shootout. The 27-year-old goaltender is still extremely raw in terms of NHL experience, having made just 33 NHL starts over his first two seasons. Goaltenders often take longer to develop but Stalock is even older due to a freak nerve injury that set him back in 2011. Shortly after winning his NHL debut in a 4-3 relief appearance, Stalock was stepped on by Dwight King. The fact Stalock has made it all the way back is a bit of a minor miracle in its own right.
Fan Favorite
You can't help but root for a guy like Stalock. The Minnesota native has long had the reputation in the lower levels as the guy who makes the big save when the team needs it. And for Stalock to have made it all the way back from such a gruesome injury is a testament to his work ethic and his love of the game. He truly is a guy of tremendous character. But because of the quality person that he is on and off the ice, it makes it all the more disappointing that the Sharks seem unwilling to give him a real opportunity. It is not like Antti Niemi has proven himself to be anything but an average goaltender.
With Niemi being extremely inconsistent and unsigned next season, it has been a surprise to many why Stalock hasn't seen more time between the pipes this season. His save percentage is currently a disappointing .902 but that is actually a higher percentage than Niemi has posted in two of his four postseasons with the Sharks. Furthermore, Stalock turned in a .932 save percentage last season behind a much stronger Sharks team. Neither sample size is big enough though to really judge what Stalock is capable of. Only 18 starts last season and 15 starts this season are not enough to prove whether or not Stalock can be a No. 1 goaltender in this league. Sure, he didn't put up great numbers with AHL Worcester, but Niemi was also unspectacular numbers wise in the lower levels. Unfortunately, even if Niemi doesn't return next season, it doesn't seem like Stalock will ever get his chance.
Deserves Much More From Management
If the Sharks were really interested in giving Stalock a shot to prove himself, this would have been the season to split time equally between the two netminders. San Jose began the season that way with each goaltender starting three of their first six games. That rotation randomly stopped though after just six games despite Stalock having stopped 97 of the first 104 shots he faced. Say what???? That's right, despite sporting a .932 save percentage three games into his season, Stalock started losing ice time. Even with Niemi in a contract year, the Sharks have failed to give Stalock a chance to prove himself over a consistent work load. If I were a betting man, I would bet the combination of GM Doug Wilson and head coach Todd McLellan have already come to the conclusion that Stalock is nothing more than a backup in the NHL. Based on what exactly? Now that is a good question.
Stalock has played terrific against some big time opponents in his small samples the past two years. His 31 saves on 33 shots against the Penguins Sunday, shutouts against Montreal and Winnipeg earlier this season, and a 33/35 performance in Chicago last season. The truth is the Sharks labeling him a backup is a rush to judgement, a rush to a conclusion, something that Sharks management has done far too often these days. Regardless of good or bad samples, the Sharks are overreacting to small sample sizes and it is killing them.
While no starting goalie in the NHL consistently puts up a .932 save percentage, if given 40 plus starts in a season, I would fully expect Stalock to be over .910. That is more or less the barometer of sufficient NHL goaltending. Anything below .910 isn't very good, but .910-.912 isn't bad, .913-.916 is average, .917-.920 is good, and anything above .920 is nearing Vezina territory. Watching Stalock the last two seasons, it is hard to imagine him being so bad that he clearly drags the team down while starting half of the games next year. After everything he has been through, he deserves the chance to get that kind of playing time regardless of who else they bring in for next season. If come the end of next season Stalock has played 41 games with a sub .910 save percentage, than that will have been a much stronger indication that he isn't good enough to be a starter. Writing him off though after playing just once every couple of weeks for two seasons is quite simply a waste of an asset.
You've probably heard of the Body Mass Index (BMI) — it's a simple way of combining data about height and weight to give a rough estimate of whether your weight is healthy or not. But the BMI has several limitations, and is only a crude indicator of health. It is better used to judge weight trends in a population rather than in any one particular individual. So, researchers at City College in New York City have developed an alternative to the BMI called A Body Shape Index (ABSI), which takes waist circumference into account.
With waist circumference info, the ABSI can give a more accurate idea of weight-related health risks to people who may be dense and muscular (like athletes) but with healthy-sized waists, and to people who may be kind of "skinny fat," with a dangerous amount of fat around their abdomens. Abdominal fat is bad news, because it's related to heart disease and metabolic disorders like diabetes.
I was reflexively skeptical about the ABSI, as I am about all health headlines, but decided to check it out. The DailyMail makes it sound like ABSI is very difficult to measure (requires "computer software!") but there are simple calculators readily available on the Internet, including this one. A score of 1 means that your risk of dying is average, even after controlling for other health and demographic characteristics.
As for me: I am 5'5" and 162 lbs., which tends to surprise people, because that's pretty damn heavy, but I comfortably wear a medium size in all garments. For reference, the last jeans I bought were a size 10 at Express (I was feeling a little high school nostalgic, don't judge). Here is a pic of me wearing an impulsively-purchased Forever 21 crop top:
No washboard abs, but pretty unremarkable, right? Well, BMI-wise, I am a 27: firmly in the "overweight" category. This has always frustrated me, because even when I exercise more, I don't really lose weight. In fact, it took eating fully vegan for me to drop down to the "normal" category, but I was hungry, blood sugar crashy, and scrawny-looking.
Compare that to my ABSI: with a respectable 29-inch waist, my 5'5", 162 lbs. frame earns a ABSI score of .68. In other words, my score is significantly better than average, and indicates that women my size bear a much lower than average risk of mortality compared to other American women our age. Not bad, I'll take it.
So, my experience is one data point confirming that "ABSI had little correlation with height, weight, or BMI." Though my ABSI is low, I'm not short or light, and my BMI kind of sucks. I'm not trying to rationalize my weight or size — I'd lose weight if I thought it'd save my life — but ABSI really does seem to be a better indicator of mortality risk than BMI. Knowledge is power, so try a calculator (this version shows both measures side-by-side) and see if BMI has been lying to you all along.

hey white people
do not pretend to be all-knowing and worldly by butting into discussions about tamika flynn being black (which she is, seriously, it's canon there is no debate here) and saying she could be japanese bc the name is maybe japanese. as an asian person, i highly doubt you're that knowledgeable at all about japanese names tbh so would you kindly stop pretending to know anything about this specific culture? all you're doing is derailing the conversation in a rly shitty condescending way
asian people aren't your passive model minority tools that you can use to silence other poc, especially black people, like. do not do the same thing white society has always done to us, which is pitted us against each other for your own creepy benefit and amusement. you don't speak for us and i would thank you not to try because it's so fucking dehumanizing
there is a reason why the writers decided to make this incredibly intelligent, respected, resilient, and brave character a young black girl. SPECIFICALLY. how often do you see young black women depicted so positively and without stereotypes? if you're consciously gonna make her a pretty little white girl instead, you are actively undoing all the good that the show makes an effort to prioritize
and finally, i notice that white people only bring up tamika's name being possibly japanese when other people, primarily poc, are talking about how happy they are that she's such a well-written character who is a black girl. i KNOW you never care about other characters being possibly asian when they're fan favorites typically depicted as white, ie: cecil, earl harlan, etc. in fact, plenty of people have gotten shit for having asian headcanons of those characters and hardly anyone said anything about that, sooo? what's your deal? why is white tamika so ~sacred, why do you need to defend whitewashing so goddamn hard
don't use us as your excuse to push your own anti-blackness forward
Using slang at an airport could get you in trouble with the TSA: after a 29-year-old airline passenger described his lunch as “the bomb” – thereby indicating the deliciousness of his sandwich – he was detained, questioned and missed his flight.
His lunch was “the bomb,” but the security process was not: Jason Michael Cruz was at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport last Thursday when the Transportation Security Administration came after him.
A TSA officer had overheard the young man talk to a friend and describe a deli sandwich he bought as “the wrong kind of bomb.” Cruz was referring to a 12-inch sandwich that a local Astoria deli calls “The Bomb” – a slang term that indicates both the excellence of the sandwich and the ‘explosively' jam-packed ingredients between the bread. The sandwich was fully packed with cold cuts, cheese and toppings, but a nearby TSA agent didn't know the context of the conversation between Cruz and his friend, Matthew Okumoto.
Cruz said he wanted to bring “The Bomb” aboard the plane in his carry-on luggage, which a TSA official interpreted as a discussion about an explosive device, the New York Post reports. Paranoid that the men planned to detonate an explosive weapon on their plane to Los Angeles, the official reported the conversation to her supervisor, Robert Haddock.
Officers then detained the pair at a security checkpoint, subjected them to questioning in a holding area, called the airport police and caused the men to miss their flight.
“The TSA clerk probably got a merit badge for her quick thinking in reporting the Scary Terroristy Threat to a supervisor, and that supervisor probably got promoted. Meanwhile, Cruz missed his flight,” writes Lisa Simeone, a blogger for the TSA News Blog.
Meanwhile, TSA agents fail to discover explosives going through airport security. Last month, an undercover TSA agent successfully bypassed security at Newark Liberty National Airport with a mock bomb. To test the effectiveness of the security screening procedures, the agent went through two screenings with an improvised explosive device-like contraption in his pants.
TSA never discovered the device. Instead, agents have stopped passengers for describing sandwiches, removed the legs of a double-amputee, laughed at nude images of airline passengers, stolen expensive jewelry from travelers and arrested a man for carrying a jar of peanut butter.
Travelers wishing to avoid arrest should refrain from describing their lunch items as “the bomb” – even if they do provide an “explosion” of flavor. Speaking about contraptions at an airport may more quickly lead to an arrest than discretely bringing one.
Mother claims her children can speak to dead people after they discovered a ghost in the attic (but dad's not convinced)
Pam Billington, 38, believes Jadon, 10, and Lucy, eight, have 'a gift'
Says they have made friends with more than ten 'spirits' in the past year
Ghosts even followed when family moved from Manchester to Cheshire
'I love having spirits in the house - I think it's great,' says Mrs Billington
Most parents like to boast about their children's talents, but you might think Pam Billington would keep her family's special abilities to herself.
The 38-year-old is convinced her two youngest Jadon 10, and Lucy, eight, can talk to dead people.
Mrs Billington, from Cheshire, says they have made friends with more than ten spirits - including their own grandmother - in the past year.

Hidden talent: Mother Pam Billington, right, says two of her children - Lucy, left, and Jadon, centre, can talk to ghosts. Emily, second from the right, has not been blessed with the gift
Haunted house: The attic where the Billington children claim to have talked to spirits
She says the children talk about their new friends so much it feels as if they're part of the family.
'It all started a couple of years ago when Jadon told me he had been visited by an angel in the night ,' Mrs Billington said.
'At first I dismissed it as being the product of an overactive imagination. But when Lucy started talking about it too I started to listen.
'It's a gift and you either have it or you don't. It isn't a hoax, I really believe my kids can talk to spirits.'
The spirit visits began in 2011 at the family's former home in Manchester where, according to the children, the ghosts lived among them and even in their attic.
In March this year, the family moved to a new home in Sandbach, Cheshire, but the children claim the ghosts relocated too.
Mrs Billington, a full-time mother, says she became a believer after experiencing a strange encounter of her own.
She said: 'One night I was watching TV and I said to Jadon if they are really here now ask one of them to tug at my trouser leg.
'Jadon asked, then a few seconds later I felt something prod my leg and I saw with my own eyes my trousers move.

'It's incredible. Now, they touch me all the time. They'll poke me in the arm and touch me on the leg. I've even been poked in the eye by a ghost.
'They also made the television go fuzzy when Jadon asked one to prove that he was there.
'You have to experience it to understand. I've always read things but I didn't have a true appreciation of it until I went through it with my children.'
She added: 'I love having spirits in the house, I think it's great.
'I think it shows that anything's possible and it gives me hope for when I pass away. I know that this is not the end and we carry on.'
As an atheist, Mrs Billington says she didn't raise her children to believe in ghosts and has not nurtured their psychic ability in any way.
But the children, who are home-schooled, are convinced.
Among the ghostly guests are an American couple called Sam and Simon Crease, who Jadon talks to, along with an angel called Michael.
Lucy has formed a bond with a young girl called Rose.
And, at her new home in Cheshire, she says she has seen a ghostly woman in a neighbouring garden, believed to be the spirit of an old woman who recently passed away there.
Jadon said: 'I used to have trouble sleeping because I always felt like someone was watching me.
'I would wake up in the night and run into mum and dad's room.
'Now when I see spirits I talk to them - and they talk back. I see them during the day and night.'
He added: 'Mum and dad asked me if I was making this up and I'm not - there really are ghosts in the house.'
Believers: Mrs Billington, who home schools the children, says she has done nothing to encourage their psychic ability
Selected few: Eldest child Emily, centre, hasn't encountered the ghosts but says she would 'freak out' if she did
Although Lucy is used to her ghostly friends she admitted she still got 'freaked' out by their late-night antics.
She said: 'I used to get scared. When I first saw them I didn't know whether it was a spirit or my imagination.
'Now I see lots of them not and I'm used to it.'
While Pam is convinced her children have a special gift, Daron, who was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, is still skeptical.
The 40-year-old health and safety advisor said he had never experienced a ghostly encounter of his own.
He added: 'I was raised in a religion that is definitely against things like spirits.
'I am still a little bit cautious with my children when we talk about ghosts but they seem okay and it keeps them happy so I leave them to it.
'I reacted with disbelief at first and a few times I thought they were based on imaginary friends.
'But the children went in to so much detail when they were talking about them that as time went by I started accepting it.'
He added: 'I'm still not really 100 per cent convinced but I think there's a little bit of truth in it.
'My kids aren't liars and if you listen to how they speak they tend to be quite believable.'
Pam and Daron's eldest, Emily, is the only child in the house not to have picked up a talent for talking with ghosts and has not seen any spooky goings on.
Mexico will be without star winger Jesus “Tecatito” Corona for an extended period, El Tri manager Juan Carlos Osorio said Saturday. The 24-year-old will miss not only Mexico's World Cup qualifier against the United States on Sunday (live, 7:30 p.m. ET on FS1) but also the Confederations Cup later this month.
Osorio attributed Tecatito's absence to personal reasons but didn't elaborate further.
His absence is a considerable blow for Mexico and Osorio, who figured to start the Porto player against the USMNT and beyond. The news comes a day after Osorio also declared Miguel Layun, Rafa Marquez, Andres Guardado and Carlos Salcedo would be out against the Americans.
Article continues below ...
With Tecatito out, Osorio will likely turn to his bounty of depth at the position, with Hirving Lozano, Giovani dos Santos and Raul Jimenez all capable of filling in. As he loves to experiment, Osorio could even call on Jurgen Damm or Javier Aquino with a switched-up formation.
Osorio isn't short of options, but odds are he would have liked to be able to stick with Tecatito. Unfortunately, he won't be able to against the U.S. and in the Confederations Cup.

WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Bidding on a key piece of the wireless airwaves being sold by the U.S. government started rising again on Monday after it appeared stalled at the end of last week, according to data released by the Federal Communications Commission on Monday.
A $4.71 billion offers made last Thursday for a nationwide package of the “C” block of wireless spectrum was surpassed by a combination of eight separate bids for regional pieces of the C-block airwaves that totaled $4.74 billion, according to the FCC, which is conducting the auction.
The bidders' identities are being kept secret until the entire auction ends, under FCC rules. But analysts point to Verizon Wireless and Internet search leader Google as the most likely bidders for the C block.
“This could reflect a continued battle between two original bidders — most likely Verizon Wireless and Google — on the C block, or could represent an entirely different bidder or combination of bidders that are exiting the sky-high prices of (another) block,” analysts at Stifel Nicolaus said in a research note.
Bidding on the nationwide package of C-block airwaves stopped late Thursday and Friday. But on Monday, the FCC received new high bids for five individual regions of the C-block spectrum, pushing the combined offers for all eight regions above the bid for the nationwide package.
It was unclear whether the piecemeal regional bids on Monday had been put together by a single bidder aiming to acquire the entire block of spectrum or were offers from several different suitors, Stifel Nicolaus said.
The high bids cover the U.S. Northeast, Southeast, Central region, West, Alaska, Hawaii, Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley.
The single $4.71 billion bids last week exceeded the $4.64 billion minimum price set by the FCC and triggered a condition sought by Google Inc (GOOG.O) that would make the spectrum accessible to any device or software application.
Whatever company submitted the $4.71 billion package bids will have a chance to top the new high bids when the auction resumes on Tuesday morning.
However, if last week's high bidder was Google and it was topped on Monday by Verizon, Google may “fold its hand” and let Verizon acquire the C-block spectrum, Stifel Nicolaus said.
Analysts have speculated that Google might be aiming to push the bidding far enough to trigger open access, rather than to actually win the auction.
The C block is one of five groups of 700-megahertz spectrum being offered. The top bids on Monday totaled $18.82 billion for all five blocks, raising more money than any previous FCC auction.
The 700-megahertz signals are valuable because they can go long distances and penetrate thick walls. The airwaves are being returned by television broadcasters as they move to digital from analog signals in early 2009.
Other potential bidders in the auction that began Jan. 24 range from entrenched carriers AT&T Inc (T.N) and Verizon Wireless to possible new competitors like Google, EchoStar Communications Corp (DISH.O) and Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N.

Good news for people fearful of needles and squeamish of shots: Scientists at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society report the design of a painless patch that may someday render hypodermic needles — as well as annual flu shots — a thing of the past. Lined with tiny "microneedles," these patches could make treatment of diabetes and a wide range of other diseases safer, more effective and less painful. Used as tiny hypodermic needles, they could improve treatment of macular degeneration and other diseases of the eye.
"It's our goal to get rid of the need for hypodermic needles in many cases and replace them with a patch that can be painlessly and simply applied by a patient," says Mark Prausnitz, Ph.D. "If you can move to something that's as easy to apply as a band-aid, you've now opened the door for people to self-administer their medicine without special training."
Prausnitz says that advances in the electronics industry in microfabricating very small objects like transistors enabled the development of microneedles. "We've built off those technological advances to address a need in medicine," he explains. "We're trying to bring the two worlds together." Each needle is only a few hundred microns long, about the width of a few strands of human hair.
Prausnitz and his colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology suggest that the microneedle patch could, for instance, replace yearly trips to the doctor for flu shots.
"Although it would probably first be used in a clinical setting, our vision is to have a self-administered flu vaccine patch. So instead of making an appointment with your doctor to get your flu shot, you can stop by the pharmacy or even get a patch in the mail and self-apply. We think that could very much increase the vaccine coverage since it would be easier for people to be vaccinated," Prausnitz explains.
In a collaboration with Emory University, Prausnitz and his team administered flu vaccines via conventional injections and microneedle patches in mice. After exposing the mice to the flu, they compared the resulting immune response and antibody levels. They found that the antibody levels were the same by either route. Taking a closer look, they discovered that microneedle delivery resulted in a better protective immune response by other measures.
"Toward the goal of a flu vaccine patch, we are continuing the animal studies, but we're also working toward our first human trial, which we hope to do in 2010," Prausnitz says.
Microneedles are not just able to deliver drugs through the skin — they can also be used for targeted drug delivery in the eye. They may help create an improved treatment for macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the United States.
In recent years, macular degeneration has become treatable thanks to new drugs that halt and partially reverse the disease. The new drugs are a victory for the millions of patients suffering macular degeneration, but the treatment is not pleasant — the drugs must be injected directly into the eye every month.
"For the squeamish there are obvious drawbacks, but more importantly, there are real safety concerns about that kind of repeated injection into the eye. With a microneedle, we can still do the same kind of concept, injecting something into the eye, but we can now do it with a very short needle that doesn't penetrate all the way in," says Prausnitz, adding that "no one else is working on microneedle-based drug delivery to the eye."
He notes that microneedle treatments of the eye can target specific tissues in the eye. "In localizing the delivery, microneedle treatments for macular degeneration and other diseases of the eye may prove safer than conventional needles. We're now doing experiments with rabbits and non-human primates — we hope to have the first human trial in the next few years," says Prausnitz.
THE SNP and Labour have joined forces to condemn plans to cut tax credits in the “first true blue Tory Budget” for almost 20 years.
SNP depute leader Stewart Hosie accused Chancellor George Osborne of “acting like Robin Hood in reverse”, while both parties fear more than 500,000 children in Scotland whose families receive tax credits will suffer.
It is working people who will bear the brunt of this Government's cuts Ian Murray MP
There are 296,000 households in Scotland with children who receive tax credits, with much of the cash going to help to work families on low wages.
It is widely anticipated that Mr Osborne, delivering his first Budget in a Conservative administration after five years in coalition, will cut the payments.
Mr Hosie, the SNP Treasury spokesman at Westminster, said: “The Chancellor has set himself the task of tackling the UK's productivity weakness in his first true blue Tory Budget.
“I hope that any plans he announces are more successful than his record on deficit reduction, in which he totally failed to meet any of the targets he set himself.
“But according to the leaks so far, the reality is that George Osborne is more concerned with deeper cuts to public services and reducing people's incomes - acting like Robin Hood in reverse.
“The likely changes to be announced for tax credits will simply cut household budgets, which as the First Minister has pointed out will hit the poorest families with children hardest.”
He added: “The Chancellor has said that his plan is designed to achieve the fiscal targets set out in the Charter for Budget Responsibility.
“However, we know the scale of the spending cuts the Chancellor has planned - as set out in the March Budget - significantly exceeds what is actually required to meet the UK Government's own fiscal targets.
“There is, therefore, flexibility for the UK Government to meet its fiscal objectives without implementing in full the spending cuts that are currently planned for the coming years. However, the Budget looks set to be an offering from an austerity cult - damaging the economy, and hurting hardworking and vulnerable people.”
Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said: “The Tories came to office claiming that this Government would be on the side of working families. Before the Budget has even been published it is becoming clear that, once again, it is working people who will bear the brunt of this Government's cuts.
“With their proposed cuts to tax credits, the Budget risks cutting the feet from under people who do the right thing, go out to work every day and try to do the best by their families.
“Nearly 300,000 families in Scotland, including half a million children, will be affected by George Osborne's cuts to tax credits, at the same time as he refuses to rule out a further tax cut for millionaires.
“This Government needs to be tackling the root causes of the rising welfare bill - low pay and rising housing costs - to bring down the deficit in a sustainable way.”

During a recent panel discussion, The Exponential View's Azeem Azhar and a couple of invited expert guests talked about democracy's vulnerability in the age of information technology and social media (you can listen to the recording here). As probably surprises no one, Facebook's role in the weakening of democracy and its institutions came up several times. And, as also should surprise no one, there was little optimism among the participants about that dubious characters will suddenly stop leveraging Facebook through bots, micro-targeting, fake news and the creation of alternate realities to undermine democratic values and essential shared minimum consensus.
But there is something everyone who is worried about the damage of social-media-enabled manipulation to the public discourse, can do: quitting Facebook.
I am specifically not referring to the company's other services such as Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — just to facebook.com and its app. This is not an ideological rant against the company. There is neither a need for a ceremonially deletion of your Facebook account. Just stopping to use facebook.com (and its app) is enough. By doing that, you'll help to weaken its business model, which is the most impactful power you have.
Facebook (the service) exists because it makes a lot of money from every single user. It doesn't exist because Facebook (the company) wants to harm democracy. It exists because it got evident that billions of people will spend large amounts of time on Facebook, and that their attention can be used to sell ads, which generates Facebook billions of dollars in yearly profit.
And so, the math is actually quite simple: If Facebook (the service) in its current state stops making the company money, it'll go away. Facebook will then focus on its other highly successful apps and on other products.
If you don't conclude that Facebook in its current state is a problem for democracy, you are ignoring a lot of the evidence that emerged over the past two years and that clearly suggests a causation, but you don't need to continue reading then.
But if you are among those who worry about Facebook's role, then you should stop using it. Otherwise, you give the company one more reason to keep offering the very service which you think is contributing negatively to the current state of uncertainty in politics and society. It doesn't matter whether you are using it in a highly ethical manner and only share properly vetted news articles. What matters is that you are part of it, and that you sustain its business model.
You're quitting Facebook won't change anything right way. Many people quitting Facebook will.
If you agree with the premise of this post, but disagree with that individually quitting Facebook will change anything, then you probably also are a person who doesn't vote, because in the grand scheme of things, your single vote doesn't matter.
And if you agree with the premise of this post, but don't want to give up on Facebook, fine. But then you should be honest with yourself: You might claim to worry about democracy, but you are not willing to make sacrifices to protect it.
A dad who took his children to pick Mother's Day flowers from a grass verge filmed a police officer confiscating the bouquet.
David Taylor criticised Nottinghamshire Police after the officer took away a bunch of 27 daffodils his two daughters had picked from the roadside, claiming he had been 'criminalised'.
But police insist the flowers should not have been taken from council-maintained verge - with the officer calling it a 'criminal offence' in the video.
Watch the row here...

Mr Taylor, from Nottingham, had been visiting his mother in Mansfield when he asked the girls if they'd like to pick some daffodils from the side of the road.
He said it was a 'spur of the moment' idea to entertain his two daughters, Rosemary, 10, and Emily, five.
In the video, David tells the officer: "I think you're disgusting, taking flowers off children."
Police said the officer had spoken to the family about picking flowers, and had taken the bunch of 27 flowers to a care home so they did not go to waste.
Mr Taylor, a carpenter, said: "I had told the girls not to pick too many, and they had about a handful.

"We turned around to go back to the car and a police officer was stood there and said we shouldn't be doing that.
"I said I understood where she was coming from, but there are hundreds by the side of the road down there."
He claims the police officer then took the flowers from his girls and made him feel as if they had been 'criminalised'.
"She took the flowers from the girls and it upset them which is what made me act the way I did by taking the video," he added.

"I have always taught my girls to respect the laws, and for the sake of picking flowers I now have to explain to my kids that what they did was wrong.
"I feel like it could have been dealt with a bit better - with some common sense. She gave me a telling off, which I understand, but the flowers had already been picked so I don't see why she had to take them from the girls.
"It has ruined Mother's Day. The kids are just kids so they will get over it - it's just really rattled me that she took that attitude."
A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: "Yesterday (March 25), an officer spotted a family picking flowers from a council maintained verge near Berryhill Park, Mansfield.
Credit: SWNS
"The officer provided the family with some advice about picking flowers and the matter was not taken any further.
"A bunch of 27 flowers were taken to a nearby care home so they did not go to waste."
Under the UK law, it is not permitted to pick any flowers which are in council parks or on council-maintained displayed, roundabouts or verges.
Any gardens planted by organisations, such as community gardens, are also off limits.

XTC was one of the great post-punk bands of the '80s. They created cleverly-written, tightly-played tunes that made you want to dance to subjects as dark as war (“Generals and Majors”) and abortion (“Respectable Street”). Andy Partridge's clear, stinging vocals zeroed in on harsher aspects of life (“Dear God”) – but Colin Moulding (bass), Dave Gregory (guitar) and Terry Chambers (drums) never lost the beat. XTC gave up touring in 1982, after Partridge suffered a nervous breakdown on a Paris stage. (He had a long dependence on valium to conquer his stage fright; his wife had thrown out his pills without telling him.) After that, the band became a studio group. Their 1986 album, Skylarking (produced by Todd Rundgren), gave us the Beatlesque confection, “Earn Enough for Us.” They soldiered on with a few more albums, but by 2005, the great XTC was essentially defunct.
There's good news for fans, though: Andy Partridge has just released a new book, Complicated Game: Inside the Songs of XTC (with Todd Bernhardt). Composed of a series of interviews, it reveals the story behind 30 of the band's best songs, straight from the source. There's also more than a bit of reflection by Partridge, on the struggles for both money and critical respect for this often-overlooked band.
Last year, Elvis Costello published his own look back at his career, Unfaithful Music and Disappearing Ink; Partridge's book is a fitting bookend, as another look at a band that created searingly-clever (and simply great) great pop tunes.

Tuesday night's vote represents a specifically rough patch for Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy. Rank-and-file reject Patriot Act
House Republicans Tuesday night got a harsh introduction to the majority, as more than two dozen rank-and-file GOP lawmakers voted against reauthorizing the Patriot Act.
And just hours before the vote on the Bush-era homeland security measure, GOP leaders yanked a trade bill from consideration as the Ways and Means Committee is “working through issues.”
Story Continued Below
There was no sign that the leadership saw the setbacks coming. The Patriot Act was moved to the floor under suspension of the rules — a provision that requires two-thirds majority (290 votes) to pass and is often used for noncontroversial legislation. After holding the vote open well past the 15-minute window, it failed 277 to 148 with five Republicans and four Democrats not voting.
Republican leaders will bring the bill back to the floor under a rule, where it will almost certainly secure the 218-vote threshold.
It was a specifically rough patch for Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was the subject of much finger-pointing after the vote, as he is charged with vote-counting. Erica Elliott, spokesman for McCarthy, noted that most House Democrats voted against the bill, “deny[ing] their own administration's request for key weapons in the war on terror.”
Other Republicans blamed Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) for the debacle. Sensenbrenner is a senior Judiciary Committee Republican.
Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) office had no comment on the trade bill or Patriot Act failure. He did not vote, which is somewhat of a tradition for the speaker. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and McCarthy voted for the Patriot Act extension.
The Patriot Act has long been a contentious issue on Capitol Hill. It was passed shortly after Sept. 11 to give the government expanded surveillance powers, while breaking down barriers between the CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies.
But many — ranging from liberals like Rep. Dennis Kucinich (Ohio), to libertarians like Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) — have long expressed concerns over the sweeping breadth of the legislation. Kucinich called Tuesday's vote a “significant defeat,” adding that it will “fuel opposition” to the measure nationwide.
CULVER CITY, Calif. — A day after offering a forceful denunciation of Donald J. Trump, Hillary Clinton on Friday expressed hope that she was only days away from putting the long-running Democratic nominating fight behind her.
“If all goes well, I will have the great honor as of Tuesday to be the Democratic nominee for president,” she said at a rally featuring a lengthy lineup of well-known actresses, including Sally Field, Debra Messing, Elizabeth Banks, Sophia Bush and Mary Steenburgen.
Mrs. Clinton is expected to secure enough delegates on Tuesday to become the party's presumptive nominee, probably before the polls close in California, one of the six states with nominating contests that day.
The moment cannot come soon enough for Mrs. Clinton, who has already turned her attention to Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, attacking him on a variety of subjects at campaign events, while almost never mentioning her remaining Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
The third draft of the rules for Oregon medical cannabis dispensaries were made public Wednesday. Here is my open letter to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Dispensary Rules Advisory Committee. You can find out about this process and how to contact them here. I encourage Oregonians to contact the committee with your thoughts and ideas for these rules. You can have an impact; you can make a difference!
“I write today as a registered caregiver in the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) and a concerned stakeholder for the new rules being established for medical cannabis dispensaries. I have read the third draft of the rules, and I am thankful to the committee for their hard work. While this letter contains my personal views, I believe it is important to note that I shared my thoughts at a recent meeting of about thirty OMMP cardholders; they echo my sentiments.
The rules draft makes it clear that dispensaries will need to have their cannabis tested. I agree that this is incredibly important. I think that this is one of the greatest benefits that regulation accomplishes. I would like to see the rules specify that the testing be done by an un-involved third-party laboratory. Labs set up specifically to test cannabis require special equipment and uniquely trained employees, technicians and chemists to ensure accurate and non-biased results, for an extra level of accountability and security. I think that allowing dispensaries to do their own testing creates a conflict of interest and too many opportunities for record tampering and misrepresentation to the OMMP registrants they serve. I hope that the committee will keep this in mind and change the rules to make third-party testing the only option for all dispensaries.
Another concern I have involves the 1,000 foot rule. I understand the reasoning being creating the rule with regards to schools, and I agree with that part. I would like to see that be the only limitation of this nature. I think that it is important to give prospective dispensaries the opportunity to work together by allowing them to share space and create collectives and co-ops that provide a larger selection. If this cannot be accomplished, I would like to see an exception to that rule to allow dispensaries to operate side-by-side for events, trade shows and farmers markets. For patients with limited mobility, the opportunity to explore more than one option in one place is valuable to our community.
Lastly, I would like to see the rules make accommodation for dispensaries to provide a space in their facilities for patients to medicate, and have the opportunity to try the medicine to make sure it helps their condition. With no “official” research and only anecdotal evidence, we have learned that even the same strain of cannabis can have different effects on the end-user. Having the opportunity to sample the medicine is vital.
I appreciate your time and consideration, as well as the opportunity to comment.
Sincerely,
Anna Diaz

They played the roles of two down-and-out heroin addicts in Trainspotting twenty years ago.
But Ewan McGregor and Jonny Lee Miller's characters Mark 'Rent Boy' Renton and Simon 'Sick Boy' Williamson looked to have kicked their habits and adopted a professional demeanour as they shot scenes for the highly-anticipated sequel on Saturday.
The actors were were joined by director Danny Boyle, 59, and the crew outside the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh as the sun shone down.

Hard at work: Ewan McGregor and Jonny Lee Miller shot scenes for the highly-anticipated Trainspotting sequel in Edinburgh on Saturday
The pair were business-like in appearance, with Ewan wearing a khaki coat over a black suit as he carried a bundle of paperwork.
Meanwhile, Jonny, 43, wore a grey suit with a black shirt and tie and carried a black laptop case in his right hand.
The stars' faces held serious expressions, no doubt they were heading to the government building for matters of importance.

The new film is based based on novelist Welsh's follow-up book, Porno, which is being adapted by screenwriter John Hodge for the big screen.
The sequel is set ten years after Trainspotting and sees the characters cross paths again, but with an alternative gritty backdrop of the pornography business, rather than heroin use.
In Porno, Renton owns a nightclub in Amsterdam, Begbie is being released from prison, and Spud is actually trying to kick his drug habit.
Spud also has love woes as his relationship with his partner Alison is strained and he feels like he has become a burden on her.
Creator Welsh is set to appear in the role of Mikey Forrester in the follow-up.
In May, we asked EFF members to write their California legislators and urge them to support SB 914, a bill that requires the police to obtain a search warrant before searching a recent arrestee's cell phone.
EFF is happy to report that yesterday, the California Senate passed SB 914 with a bipartisan vote of 31-4. SB 914 already passed in the California Assembly in August on a 28-9 bipartisan vote, and is now on its way to Governor Brown's desk.
Introduced by California Senator Mark Leno, and sponsored by the Northern California ACLU and the First Amendment Coalition, SB 914 was intended to reverse the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Diaz, which permitted police officers to search the content of a person's cell phone under a narrow Fourth Amendment exception permitting warrantless searches of the area immediately around a recent arrestee as "incident to arrest."
We hope and expect that Governor Brown will sign SB 914 into law despite the furious opposition of law enforcement. Cell phones contain a treasure trove of personal information, far beyond a person's call history, that deserves protection from the prying eyes of the police. Without SB 914, officers can use a pretextual arrest to casually browse the data on a person's cell phone for any reason, even if that person is never charged with a crime. Without requiring a search warrant, officers can search any arrested person's cell phone, even when they don't suspect there is any evidence of a crime on the device. SB 914 doesn't impede law enforcement's ability to investigate crimes; it just extends the Fourth Amendment to the contents of cell phones, requiring officers to show a judge there is probable cause that the phone has evidence of a crime before it is searched.
EFF looks forward to Governor Brown following the California legislature's lead in protecting the private data stored on cell phones and make SB 914 the law.
A donkey which saved a sheep from being savaged by a dog has been honoured for her bravery.
Dotty came to the aid of her friend Stanley in their shared paddock when a dog launched a frenzied attack on him, according to animal charity the PDSA.
She pinned the dog to the ground until it let go of five-year-old Stanley.
On Tuesday, Dotty was presented with the PDSA Certificate for Animal Bravery at her farm in Throxenby, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire.
Nearly two years on, the two animals are inseparable - even sharing the same stable at night.
Her owner Ann Rogers, 63, said: "Dotty was so brave that day.
"She saw her friend Stanley in distress and charged down the field to rescue him from the dog's jaws.
"I am so proud of Dotty and so pleased that her bravery is being recognised by PDSA."
'Aggressive dog'
PDSA senior vet Elaine Pendlebury said: "Donkeys are very stoical and protective animals.
"Often when faced with a threat they will rise up to face their enemy, in this case an aggressive dog.
"Dotty showed herself to be a true protector of the animals she sees as her family and her bravery saved Stanley from further harm, and possibly death."
Mrs Rogers explained how she came across Dotty three years ago tethered on the side of the road where she was skinny and frail.
She rescued the animal and put her on her Row Brow Farm smallholding where she shares fields with Stanley, who was orphaned as a newborn lamb.
The pair share the paddocks with a menagerie of pets and rescued animals including rabbits, goats, peacocks and llamas.
The PDSA Certificate for Animal Bravery was instituted in 2001 and Dotty is the 10th winner and the first non-dog recipient of the award.
In this Tuesday, April 25, 2017 photo, assistant research technician Henri Berger, talks about live yeast cultures at a New York University lab in the Alexandria Center for Life Sciences in New York, where researchers are attempting to create completely man-made, custom-built DNA.

NEW YORK (AP) — At Jef Boeke's lab, you can whiff an odor that seems out of place, as if they were baking bread here.
But he and his colleagues are cooking up something else altogether: yeast that works with chunks of man-made DNA.
Scientists have long been able to make specific changes in the DNA code. Now, they're taking the more radical step of starting over, and building redesigned life forms from scratch. Boeke, a researcher at New York University, directs an international team of 11 labs on four continents working to “rewrite” the yeast genome, following a detailed plan they published in March.
Their work is part of a bold and controversial pursuit aimed at creating custom-made DNA codes to be inserted into living cells to change how they function, or even provide a treatment for diseases. It could also someday help give scientists the profound and unsettling ability to create entirely new organisms.
The genome is the entire genetic code of a living thing. Learning how to make one from scratch, Boeke said, means “you really can construct something that's completely new.”

The research may reveal basic, hidden rules that govern the structure and functioning of genomes. But it also opens the door to life with new and useful characteristics, like microbes or mammal cells that are better than current ones at pumping out medications in pharmaceutical factories, or new vaccines. The right modifications might make yeast efficiently produce new biofuels, Boeke says.
Some scientists look further into the future and see things like trees that purify water supplies and plants that detect explosives at airports and shopping malls.
Also on the horizon is redesigning human DNA. That's not to make genetically altered people, scientists stress. Instead, the synthetic DNA would be put into cells, to make them better at pumping out pharmaceutical proteins, for example, or perhaps to engineer stem cells as a safer source of lab-grown tissue and organs for transplanting into patients.
Some have found the idea of remaking human DNA disconcerting, and scientists plan to get guidance from ethicists and the public before they try it.
Still, redesigning DNA is alarming to some. Laurie Zoloth of Northwestern University, a bioethicist who's been following the effort, is concerned about making organisms with “properties we cannot fully know.” And the work would disturb people who believe creating life from scratch would give humans unwarranted power, she said.
“It is not only a science project,” Zoloth said in an email. “It is an ethical and moral and theological proposal of significant proportions.”
Rewritten DNA has already been put to work in viruses and bacteria. Australian scientists recently announced that they'd built the genome of the Zika virus in a lab, for example, to better understand it and get clues for new treatments.
At Harvard University, Jeffrey Way and Pamela Silver are working toward developing a harmless strain of salmonella to use as a vaccine against food poisoning from salmonella and E. coli, as well as the diarrhea-causing disease called shigella.
A key goal is to prevent the strain from turning harmful as a result of picking up DNA from other bacteria. That requires changing its genome in 30,000 places.
“The only practical way to do that,” Way says, “is to synthesize it from scratch.”
The cutting edge for redesigning a genome, though, is yeast. Its genome is bigger and more complex than the viral and bacterial codes altered so far. But it's well-understood and yeast will readily swap man-made DNA for its own.
Still, rewriting the yeast genome is a huge job.

It's like a chain with 12 million chemical links, known by the letters, A, C, G and T. That's less than one-hundredth the size of the human genome, which has 3.2 billion links. But it's still such a big job that Boeke's lab and scientists in the United States, Australia, China, Singapore, and the United Kingdom are splitting up the work. By the time the new yeast genome is completed, researchers will have added, deleted or altered about a million DNA letters.
Boeke compares a genome to a book with many chapters, and researchers are coming out with a new edition, with chapters that allow the book to do something it couldn't do before.
To redesign a particular stretch of yeast DNA, scientists begin with its sequence of code letters — nature's own recipe. They load that sequence into a computer, then tell the computer to make specific kinds of changes. For example one change might let them rearrange the order of genes, which might reveal strategies to make yeast grow better, says NYU researcher Leslie Mitchell.
Once the changes are made, the new sequence used as a blueprint. It is sent to a company that builds chunks of DNA containing the new sequence. Then these short chunks are joined together in the lab to build ever longer strands.
The project has so far reported building about one-third of the yeast genome. Boeke hopes the rest of the construction will be done by the end of the year. But he says it will take longer to test the new DNA and fix problems, and to finally combine the various chunks into a complete synthetic genome.
Last year, Boeke and others announced a separate effort, what is now called Genome Project-write or GP-write . It is chiefly focused on cutting the cost of building and testing large genomes, including human ones, by more than 1,000-fold within 10 years. The project is still seeking funding.
In the meantime, leaders of GP-write have started discussions of ethical, legal and social issues. And they realize the idea of making a human genome is a sensitive one.
“The notion that we could actually write a human genome is simultaneously thrilling to some and not so thrilling to others,” Boeke said. “So we recognize this is going to take a lot of discussion.”

The Hidden Welfare State
Posted on May 14, 2013 by syzygysue
The UK has two welfare states. There is one that is reported and endlessly discussed, and another, which is rarely mentioned. Whilst the first is suffering enormous cuts under the Tory/LD coalition, the other just keeps expanding.
Comedian, author and activist Rob Newman explains to the New Internationalist magazine (May 2013):
Governments on the left and the right can always justify welfare cuts by pitting, for example, mobility scooters against needle exchanges, or the soft-play area in children's playgrounds against an old people's home. Who deserves it most, they say, students or cleaners? Old or young? But when we're running not one, but two welfare states, that's a totally fake scenario. The real choice is between playgrounds or gas rigs; between Meals on Wheels or The City of London Currency Speculators' Maintenance Allowance. There's a connection – never mentioned – between, let's say, Britain's eight new deep-water gas rigs and its 200 new food banks. The connection is that the $4.5 billion subsidy package being doled out to transnational gas corporations is a very big slice of the welfare pie. And to keep the gas transnationals on the benefits to which they are addicted, hungry humans have to queue for tinned food that is too close to its sell-by date to be kept on the shelves of supermarkets, many of which are themselves massive recipients of corporate welfare.
Not only does the UK pay out unemployment benefits less generous than Romania, Albania and the US, but the wages of the employed have simply not kept pace with productivity over the last 30yrs.
Meanwhile, the corporate sector sits on a colossal cash surplus of £800bn but without investing because the real problem continues to be the lack of aggregate demand… and the richest 100 UK citizens, only 0.0003% of the electorate, now have wealth estimated at £257bn.
Nevertheless, George Osborne has been prepared to cut £18bn from benefits plus a further £81bn from public services in the name of unavoidable austerity, whilst at the same time providing huge subsidies, tax cuts and removing regulation for the hidden ‘welfare' system that benefits the private sector.
No goods or services are directly returned to the government in exchange for these expenditures, although of course, politicians will argue that they're stimulating the economy, helping to struggle industries, creating jobs or funding important research but actually this is just a corporate welfare system.
The Cato Institute estimated that in the US, $93 billion were devoted to corporate welfare in 2002. This was about 5% of the federal budget… and nearly twice the amount spent on social welfare ie. feeding people, housing the homeless, raising children out of poverty.
There is no reason to think the situation is different in the UK. However, overall statistics for the UK corporate welfare budget are hard to discover .. and the variety of different subsidies are staggering. Needless to say, our MSM focuses its attention on fraud and waste in the social welfare budget.
Welfare fraud and waste is never far from the top of the UK's news agenda – but the real figures often bear almost no resemblance to popular belief. The British public, for example, think around 27% of the welfare budget is lost of fraud, according to TUC research. The Department for Work and Pensions' latest data on fraud and error in the benefit system shows a very different reality: fraud exists, but at a far lower level than the public believes – and is outweighed by errors from claimants and officials alike. The overall figures show fraud and error are largely unchanged from last year. The DWP estimates £3.5bn has been overpaid due to errors and fraud in the system; 2.1 per cent of the overall benefit expenditure. http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/may/13/welfare-fraud-error-universal-credit
The corporate welfare budget arises from four main sources:
Paying little or no tax – Tax havens
Tax breaks
Enjoying huge subsidies
Removal of employment and environmental protection regulations
The task of covering all these areas adequately is beyond the scope of this post so I offer these quotes which illustrate some of the ways in which the corporates are benefiting from political sponsorship of their welfare:
The UK's 100 biggest public companies are running more than 8,000 subsidiaries or joint ventures in onshore and offshore tax havens, according to research published on Monday, raising fresh concerns about the full extent of corporate tax avoidance. The figures, published by the charity ActionAid, show that only two of the companies listed on the UK's FTSE 100 have no subsidiaries in tax havens – while companies such as Barclays and Tesco own hundreds. http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/may/12/uk-companies-condemned-tax-havens
Could this be the same Chancellor who in his 2012 budget offered multi-nationals which opened a finance subsidiary in a tax haven a reduction in corporation tax from the then rate of 23% to an eye-wateringly low level of just 5.5%? It could be, and it was. Is this the same Chancellor who, whilst ultimately controlling the UK Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories which constitute up to half the world's most frequently used tax havens, declined to take any action to close them down? Yes, it was again.
Four tax inspectors pursuing 124 of HMRC's most wanted tax fugitives ~ By Nicholas Watt, chief political correspondent, The Guardian, Friday 27 December 2013
http://www.michaelmeacher.info/weblog/2013/05/corporate-tax-scams-in-developing-countries-the-next-target/#more-5201
It was revealed recently that only one in four of the UK's top companies pay their taxes, meanwhile they receive tax credits to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds funded by people who did pay their taxes.
http://scriptonitedaily.wordpress.com/2013/05/12/corporate-giants-arent-wealth-creators-theyre-parasites/
… vastly profitable large chains of supermarkets … get an enormous subsidy to help with one of their major overheads, staffing costs. This is because many employees in these large and successful companies are paid only the minimum wage. And because the current minimum wage is not a living wage, nearly everyone on it has to claim tax credits to be able to make ends meet. Those tax credits are funded by the taxpayer…. Let's stop calling them “wealth creators” and start calling them state subsidised industries. http://www.searchingfinance.com/news-and-views/teresa-pearce-mp-a-living-wage.html?goback=.gde_1211737_member_236208402
Currently, it is estimated that the government has already provided £43.5bn in various subsidies including the National Infrastructure Plan, the Equity Loan and Help to Buy schemes, the Enterprise Finance Guarantee and the Regional Growth Fund, with nothing to show for it. Far greater sums are in the pipeline, up to £310bn.
http://think-left.org/2013/05/11/despite-britains-new-thatcherites-only-the-state-sector-has-recovered/
It is more important to [the Tory/LD coalition] to privatise everything they can in pursuit of their real objective of a fully marketised State rather than to compel these banks, of which the taxpayers own 82% of RBS and 39% of Lloyds, to prioritise lending to industry to kickstart the economy and get growth going at last. Even more significantly, an enforced sale before the election will at their current share value lose taxpayers £24 billions! That is truly staggering when Osborne has been prepared to cut £18bn from benefits plus a further £81bn from public services in the name of unavoidable austerity. Yet at the same time he is now disposing of assets which will gratuitously lose the public coffers £24bn. http://www.michaelmeacher.info/weblog/2013/05/osbornes-smack-in-the-face-for-all-benefit-spending-cuts-victims/
It is arguable that without the state's support the banking sector would have collapsed entirely. But even on the most favourable comparison from the low-point of the recession the subsidy has been hugely inefficient. A £1,020bn hand-out to the banks has yielded an increase in output over that time of approximately £40bn. It would have been far more efficient if the state had directed its own capital into the production of banking services, via fully nationalised and controlled banks.

114 year Workers Rights Scrapped by Coalition Government.
For the Benefit of the Conservative Party – “FOR SALE – Local Hospital and Schools “
.. if you spend £100 on healthcare in the NHS you get one hundred quid's worth of healthcare less about 5% management costs. In the private sector you'll get a hundred quid's worth less 3% management costs, 5% profit, 12% to pay bank loans and charges, plus a chunk for bonuses, dividends and return for investors. And, no provision for what happens if they go broke or get fed up.
http://www.hsj.co.uk/comment/opinion/andrew-lansley-competition-is-critical-for-nhs-reform/5041288.article
I will conclude with the 2011 nef briefing, 'Feather-bedding financial services', which asked, in addition to the unprecedented public support for the financial sector over the past three years, how much are the big banks benefitting from hidden subsidies? They identified at least three significant hidden subsidies:
The ‘Too Big to Fail' subsidy: The government now provides a public guarantee, effectively insurance against banks going bust. This gives banks a huge commercial advantage over other firms in a market system. It means banks are able to borrow money much more cheaply than if they were not ultimately underwritten by the public. Exchanges with leading auditors in front of the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs in January 2011 confirm this. A conservative analysis reveals that this hidden subsidy could be worth £30 billion annually. It means that bonuses to senior staff for ‘performance' and dividends to institutional investors are at least in part a straight transfer from the taxpayer.
The quantitative easing windfall subsidy: When it was decided that the economy needed more liquidity, the Bank of England pumped money in using the technique called ‘quantitative easing'. To meet various, and sometimes self-imposed, requirements, it did by purchasing government bonds through investment banks. Merely for being passive conduits for this ‘risk free' arrangement the banks took a cut of every trade. Here nef analysts found that banks enjoyed a significant windfall, but that lack of transparency keeps the likely amount hidden.
The ‘make the customer pay' subsidy: Looked at sympathetically, the banks have been put in a difficult position. At the same time as being required to rebuild their capital, they are also under pressure to lend. In response, the banks have tried to manage this by increasing the gap between what they have to pay to borrow money, and what they charge people to borrow from them. This is the so-called interest rate ‘spread'. But the banks have a choice. They could recapitalise by reducing or eliminating bonus and dividend payments until their capital base is rebuilt. As it is, the taxpayer is subsidising the banks twice over: once through taxpayer funded public support to the banks, and secondly through paying much higher interest to borrow than the banks do. This hidden subsidy to retail banking and one part of the investment banking world amounts to at least another £2.5 billion each year. http://www.neweconomics.org/press/entry/are-british-banks-getting-billions-in-hidden-subsidies-asks-nef
As James Galbraith wrote:
The Predator State…. The state as monopoly collector of taxes and corrupt distributor of the spoils to the private sector…
There is no common good, no public purpose, no shareholder's interest; we are the prey and governments as well as corporations are run by and for predators.
Furthermore, none of this is likely to get any better under the rules of the US-EU FTA (Free Trade Agreement) which the Tory/LDs are wanting to get signed by 2014. Part of the secret negotiations are the transfer of sovereignty from nations to private corporate tribunals who will be empowered to compel governments to change their laws or pay unlimited fines.

How The Banking Debt Crisis Can Be Overcome ~ Our Proposals
INEQUALITY
Because almost all of our money is ‘on loan' from banks, someone has to pay interest on nearly every pound in the UK. This interest redistributes money from the bottom 90% of the population to the very top 10%. Meanwhile, inflated house prices and financial instability all lead to a growing gap between the poor and the rich.
Are we already in the post-democratic era?
The holiday season tends to find me writing Perl books. This time it's the next edition of Learning Perl, last published for Perl v5.14. This time we're targeting v5.24, and there are lots of exciting new features that we want to tell the new Perl users.
We can't make promises at the beginning of the book, but here's the rough idea so far:
Goodbye, smart match. We gave it a chapter, but now it's experimental .
But, subroutine signatures! People are going to love those.
So, an appendix on experimental features. Or maybe a chapter. Mostly on how to enable them.
the /r modifier for s///
modifier for Removing most of the stuff that Perl has discarded without abandoning people using older versions.
Key-value slices, and slices, and splice .
. The double diamond operator <<>> .
. New Unicode regex stuff
I've done this too many times to promise a release date either, but late summer wouldn't be a bad guess. When I get the current version into something editable and fixed up, I'll start putting out review versions somehow. I don't know how that will work yet.
The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever
Updated
Flash mobs across Australia have thrown on flowy red dresses and green eye shadow to celebrate the Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever.
Amid the fun, fans at the Melbourne and Lismore events found time to tell us why they adore the 1978 Kate Bush film clip.
Sorry, this video has expired Video: The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever (ABC News)
The dance moves and the fact that she didn't necessarily fit into the typical pop culture. I grew up dancing to Kate Bush when I was sort of 15, 16. And when this came on Facebook I said: 'Yes I've got to do that'. Especially as I was going through cancer treatment at the time and I thought I need fun. Rani Axtens
She was dancing freely. Just the whole atmosphere of her voice as well. Everything she put on the radio was like listening to someone singing a fairytale. I have always adored Kate Bush like everyone here. Cath Russell
What don't you love about it? It's got drama, it's got passion, it's got amazing dance moves. I'm here with a group of friends. We all went and saw Kate Bush a few years ago in London. Sam Cremean
Kate Bush is really free spirited and I think that's a really great thing to celebrate about a person. Alex Creece
I think it's kind of almost this other world that she lives in. It's very ethereal. I've always been a big Kate Bush fan and I just thought it would be a lot of fun that everyone would dress up and I guess act out a song that has a lot of meaning to a lot of different people. Dale Park
Wuthering Heights is way better than golf. That's all I've got, it's better than golf. Matthew Taylor
I grew up with Wuthering Heights. I always wanted to look like Kate Bush. I love red and I love ballet, so what more could you ask for? Maree
I love the abandon, the joy, the excitement, the love and the passion that's expressed through Wuthering Heights. Jim
Wuthering Heights just feels like freedom, freedom in the hills, letting your passions run free ... total freedom. Georgi Brooke
I love the deepness, the darkness of the moors, the tragedy and the great passionate love. Amanda Shoebridge

Walk into the Amante coffee shop at 2850 Baseline Road in Boulder on any given morning and you'll see what looks like an automated teller machine sitting along one wall.
Throughout the day, a handful of people use it. One is a techie, another is a well-dressed, middle-aged couple. But this is not your grandmother's ATM. It's a Bitcoin teller machine, a portal into the brave new world of cryptocurrency.
Some call this new kind of money the grandest experiment of our time. Others fear its rising power and the rest of us have no idea what the heck it is.
Boulder's Eric Weissmann was fascinated early on with the potential of digital currency. And when the opportunity arose to own and operate Bitcoin teller machines, or BTMs, he jumped in and founded Modern Tender. Weissmann thought the architecture of the code, the blockchain, had the potential to transform currency markets.
“I was interested in Bitcoin and thought the blockchain technology was revolutionary, so I wanted a foothold in the space. We reached out to Amante because we wanted a location that was upscale, easily accessible, and attractive to early adopters and the tech demographic,” Weissmann said.
BTMs are still rare. There are 13 statewide, including two in Boulder — Weissmann's at Amante Coffee and a second machine in the Spark Boulder tech accelerator at 1310 College Ave.
The two BTMs in Boulder were installed in February of 2015. The Spark machine is owned by Aurora-based XBTeller. Officials there could not be reached for comment.
Operating outside the traditional banking system with no regulatory oversight, BTMs have experienced a surge in use as more people turn to cryptocurrencies as a haven from political instability and distrust of government-backed currencies.

Visitors use phones underneath of logo of Tencent at Global Mobile Internet Conference in Beijing Thomson Reuters TORONTO (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings Ltd has taken a $50 million stake in Kik Interactive, an investment that values the Canadian mobile messaging company at more than $1 billion, Kik said on Wednesday.
Kik, a Waterloo, Ontario-based company whose chat platform is popular with U.S. teens, has long said it aims to emulate the success of Tencent's WeChat, which has expanded from messaging to facilitating commerce in China.
The investment from Tencent, China's biggest social network and online entertainment company, helps justify that ambition, Kik Chief Executive Ted Livingston said in a phone interview.
"That company that everyone's talking about, they think Kik can do in the U.S. what they've done in China, that's why they're investing," he said.
Kik faces stiff competition in mobile chat, with Snapchat targeting the same teenage audience and Facebook Inc's Messenger and WhatsApp products claiming far more users. But Livingston is betting on a growing number of add-on services to keep its 240 million users engaged.
"The more we connect not only people, but also connect services and business, the more they'll want to stay as they get older," he said.
While not disclosing the size of the Tencent stake, Livingston said Kik is "part of the so-called unicorn club," a term describing private companies with valuations in excess of $1 billion.
Livingston declined to say when Kik might turn a profit. Last week it launched a trial product called Jam to connect users with their favorite musicians, and offers promoted chats that let advertisers engage directly with users who opt in.
Kik said it plans to use the series D funding - which brings total funding to $120.5 million - to hire staff in Waterloo and invest in other chat-based services.

At long last, the couple that sued Google for its Street View capture of their home and yard have achieved victory, in the form of a single dollar. The judge handed down the decision today, and while it's technically a win for the little guy, it doesn't make Google exactly a target for emotional duress money.
In April 2008, Aaron and Christine Boring filed suit on multiple counts against Google over Google Maps' Street View images of their private road. The same information was already available elsewhere on the internet, as well as documents on the home's sale and price, and many of the counts were thrown out. Likewise, an appeal was turned down.
Still, the couple pursued the only viable charge: a Count II Trespass. Two and half years later, the court ruled has ruled in their favor, conceding that, technically, they have a point. But their blatant lack of concern about privacy in other venues (including the fact that the couple did not seal the suit so their names wouldn't be attached) must have grated on the judge, because they were awarded a grand total of $1 in nominal damages.
If you're a fan of Games Workshop, the Warhammer franchise, or promising turn-based strategy games in general, you'll probably be pretty pleased to read that Rodeo Games has submitted Warhammer Quest to Apple for approval.
"Yes, it's in review with Apple," Rodeo Games co-founder Ben Murch responded to a fan who questioned the game's whereabouts on Twitter.
Unfortunately, Murch stopped short of announcing a release date for Warhammer Quest. According to Murch, in fact, his company hasn't decided on an official launch date yet.
"Our final submission build of Warhammer Quest is being processed in the vaults of Apple right now. We need to figure a few things out with the guys over there, then we'll be able to confirm the release date," Murch told Pocket Gamer.
"Looking at within the next couple of weeks, though."
Last week, Rodeo Games announced on its Facebook page that Warhammer Quest's very first downloadable expansion pack, Skaven, will be available at the game's launch.
If you decide to splash some cash on Skaven, you'll get new dungeon tilesets and a brand-new map to explore, as well as plenty of new missions and - naturally - fresh enemy types to battle.
We'll let you know as soon as we have more info on Warhammer Quest's official release date, so stay tuned to Pocket Gamer.
While you're waiting for that confirmation, by the way, why not check out our hands-on with Warhammer Quest. Thank me tomorrow.
The IFA has declined to confirm whether it will take action similar to that brought by its counterpart in Dublin following the infamous Thierry Henry handball that kept the Republic of Ireland out of the 2010 World Cup.
The News Letter understands, however, that IFA officials are in discussion with world football's governing body FIFA over the refereeing decisions that saw Northern Ireland eliminated from the World Cup in heartbreaking circumstances at the weekend.
Northern Ireland were ruled out of the 2018 World Cup thanks to a hotly-disputed penalty decision during the first of two qualifying play-off ties against Switzerland last Thursday.
Switzerland scored the penalty kick, giving them a 1-0 victory which Northern Ireland were then unable to overturn during Sunday night's scoreless match.
In 2009, the Republic of Ireland were eliminated from the World Cup in similarly controversial circumstances when French player Thierry Henry clearly handled the ball, allowing teammate William Gallas to score a decisive winning goal for his team.
At that time, the FAI in Dublin decided to take a case to FIFA seeking to have the Republic's elimination from the World Cup overturned.
While the legal action did not bear fruit in terms of actually giving the Republic a World Cup reprieve, the FAI's chief executive John Delaney revealed later that FIFA had made a payment of some €5 million to the FAI.
Northern Ireland centre-back Jonny Evans drew a direct comparison between the two handball incidents directly after his team's loss to Switzerland last Thursday night.
In fact, Evans insisted the decision against Northern Ireland was even worse than the one against the Republic of Ireland in 2009.
“It was actually a worse decision because the ref has made a call that was not there,” he said.
“It's different if he didn't see it. He's claimed he saw something that didn't happen which is the hardest part to take about it.”
In the Windsor Park game, a penalty was awarded to Switzerland for a handball by Corry Evans, after the ball was kicked straight at him with considerable force.
As he turned, it appeared to strike him on the back, near the shoulder.
Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill described the referee's decision as “bewildering” and “staggering”.
Boxing star Carl Frampton wrote on Twitter: “At the end of the day what put us out was an incompetent referee with one of the worst penalty decisions the world has ever seen.”
The News Letter asked the IFA whether they plan to take action similar to that brought by the FAI back in 2009, or whether it plans to make any representations to FIFA.
While the IFA declined to make an official comment on Monday evening, the News Letter understands discussions with FIFA are ongoing, but not focussed on the unlikely scenario of replaying the tie or of securing Northern Ireland's entry to the World Cup by other means.
DUP MP Gregory Campbell meanwhile said that if the IFA were to bring a case to FIFA, he would support the move.
“If the IFA decide to go down that route, they will have my support, and I am sure that of most other Northern Ireland supporters,” he said.
Cray has picked Cavium's ThunderX2 processor for its first ARM-based supercomputer, quite a win for the little guy coming just a week after the 800-pound gorilla that is Qualcomm formally introduced its ARM-based server processor, the Centriq.
The Cavium ThunderX2 processor is based on 64-bit Armv8-A architecture and will be used in the Cray XC50 supercomputer. Cray customers will have a complete ARM-based supercomputer with all of the company's software tools, including the Cray Linux Environment, the Cray Programming Environment, and Arm-optimized compilers, libraries, and tools for running today's supercomputing workloads.
Also on Network World: 10 of the world's fastest supercomputers
“Adding ARM processors complements our system's ability to support a variety of host processors, and [it] gives customers a unique, leadership-class supercomputer for compute, simulation, big data analytics, and deep learning,” said Fred Kohout, Cray's senior vice president of products and chief marketing officer, in a statement.
Cray is working with multiple supercomputing centers on the development of ARM-based supercomputers, including labs in the U.S. Department of Energy and the GW4 alliance, a coalition of four leading, research-intensive universities in the U.K.
Cray XC50 supercomputers with the Cavium ThunderX2 processors will be available in both liquid-cooled cabinets and air-cooled cabinets to address a variety of data center needs. Liquid cooling is growing in popularity but still modest in use. Its primary advantage over air cooling is it can handle much more compute density than air cooling, which is limited in how much it can cool. The drawback to liquid cooling is it carries a price premium over air cooling.
The XC50 can mix and match compute blades with Intel Xeon Scalable processors, Intel Xeon Phi processors, and Nvidia Tesla GPU accelerators. The ARM-powered Cray XC50 will be available in the second quarter of 2018.
Cavium processors make their mark
Overall it's been a great week for Cavium. Ingrasys, a fully owned subsidiary of the giant Foxconn Technology Group of China, announced the production sampling of their rack-mount server platforms based on Cavium ThunderX2 products.
The Osmium platform from Ingrasys is a 2U4N rack-mount, density-optimized server platform, optimized for cloud and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. It has four compute nodes in a 2U form factor, with each compute node holding two ThunderX2 SoCs in a cache-coherent, dual-socket configuration with up to 1 TB of memory per node and 4 x16 PCIe slots, ideal for GPUs.
Another giant Chinese ODM, Gigabyte Technology, also announced production availability of ARM-based server platforms based on ThunderX2. Gigabyte's R181 series is a 1U platform with dual-socket ThunderX2 compute node with best-in-class throughput, memory configuration and capacity. The chassis has multiple PCIe expansion slots and support for up to 24 SSDs.
It's a very good showing for Cavium and not entirely surprising. Comparing Qualcomm and Cavium in ARM to Intel and AMD in x86 is tempting, but not at all fair. AMD allowed its competitive edge to slip and has only recently gotten its mojo back. Cavium has been making custom SoCs for years based on the MIPS architecture. It has migrated what it learned to ARM and was first to market, and giants like Cray and Foxconn recognize that. So, it's a good thing Qualcomm won't just mow them over as everyone jumps on board with the big player.
In the late 1970s, Afghanistan went through a period of political upheaval – exacerbated by the global chess game being played between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War.
In 1975, a group of militants from the Jamiat Islami party attempted to overthrow the government. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, support for the Islamist party continued to grow.
In April of 1978, Mir Akbar Khyber – a well-known Afghan intellectual and leader of a major faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (the ruling party at the time) – was assassinated at his home.
The government blamed his assassination on Islamist factions within the country, but Nur Muhammad Taraki – a notable communist politician – accused the Afghan government of carrying out the assassination themselves.
Using Kyhber's death as a rallying cry, Taraki was able to lead a successful revolution, after which he established the communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.
Taraki's new regime was a repressive one – tens of thousands of prisoners and political dissidents were “disappeared” (most likely executed) during his first year in power, prompting large swaths of the country to go into open rebellion against the new government.
As the pressure built, Taraki reached out to the Soviet Union for help. In December of 1979, the Soviet Army answered that call, sending Soviet troops into Afghanistan to help support Taraki's regime.
Fearing the spread of communism into the Middle East, the United States, along with allies in the UK, Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries, decided to back a coalition of multi-national insurgent groups called the Mujahideen.
The Mujahideen – comprised of Muslim fighters from Pakistan, Iran and other Islamic nations – was the main group fighting against the Soviet-backed Afghan forces.
For 10 years, the Mujahideen waged a successful guerilla campaign that proved extremely costly for the Soviet Union, both financially and in terms of human life. Finally, in February of 1989, Soviet forces pulled out of Afghanistan.
Throughout the war's duration, the US provided training, intel and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to the Mujahideen under Operation Cyclone.
The operation was one of the longest and most costly covert CIA operations in US history. Cyclone's budget started at $20-30 million in 1980, and rose as high as $630 million in 1987.
But while the CIA was spending vast sums supporting the Mujahideen directly, the United States government decided that it needed to be fighting the influence of communism in another arena as well: education.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the United States commissioned a series of textbooks that promoted violence in the form of jihad against the Soviet invaders.
One notable example is “The Alphabet of Jihad Literacy”, a textbook funded by the US and published by the University of Nebraska at Omaha. From Al-Jazeera:
The majority of the book's 41 lessons glorify violence in the name of religion. “My uncle has a gun,” reads the entry for the letter T, using the Pashto word for “gun,” “topak.” “He does jihad with the gun.”
The entry for the letter K reads,
“Kabul is the capital of our dear country. No one can invade our country. Only Muslim Afghans can rule over this country.”
“Our religion is Islam. Muhammad is our leader. All the Russians and infidels are our enemy,”
reads another section.
With the help of the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) distributed “The Alphabet of Jihad Literacy” and other textbooks containing content written by Mujahideen groups to children at refugee camps in Pakistan during the decade-long Soviet war in Afghanistan.
The revelations were made by New York University professor Dana Burde in her newly published book entitled “Schools for Conflict or for Peace in Afghanistan“. As part of her research, Burde spent more than a decade in Afghanistan and Pakistan, studying the education systems in the two countries.
While US efforts were eventually successful in driving the Soviet army out of Afghanistan, Burde says the pro-jihadist textbooks have spawned countless copies and revised editions, some of which are still being used by the Taliban to indoctrinate young children today.
Only now, the “infidels” referenced in the textbooks undoubtedly include the United States.
Burde says the books are easily repurposed to vilify the US and NATO forces. In fact, during the course of her research, she discovered that the Taliban actually insist that the books be used in schools located in areas that they control.
In recent years however, US education funding in Afghanistan has been aimed primarily at increasing stability in Afghan communities and legitimizing the NATO-backed central government in Kabul.
Since the fall of the Taliban, the US has invested more than $880 million on education in Afghanistan. But despite its honorable purposes, Burde believes this funding may have actually increased division and animosity within the country.
According to her research, the majority of this recent education funding has been spent in Pashtun areas at the heart of the insurgency, ignoring Afghanis living in more peaceful parts of the country.
Burde believes that this uneven distribution of aid has led to increased resentment towards foreigners and the central government in Kabul, saying,
“If people perceive that their enemy is getting more of those services, then that could contribute to the underlying conditions for conflict.”
Foreign intervention is a risky and delicate process. Many people believe that investing in the development and education of a country will automatically lead to increased peace, but the reality can be quite the opposite if that investment isn't spent in the right way.
Burde's revelations also illustrate how short-term solutions can often contribute to bigger, more long-term problems: the United States is currently fighting against a radical jihadist ideology that it helped to indoctrinate with its textbook initiative just a few decades ago.

About this post: My small contribution to communist literature by writing a short introduction to the movement and its ideas. Intended as an update to Albert Einstein's “Why Socialism?”. Pictured are demonstrators from the Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon alliance during the 2009 French Caribbean strikes (accessed from The Wall Street Journal behind a paywall).
1992 marked a watershed, the end of a long period. Like dominoes, the fall of one socialist state enforced the descent of yet another, and a wave of conservatism filling the void threatened to undo the progressive movements of the era. That second world, with its merits and faults, looked onto as a collective force for social change, appeared to vanish and decay. Workers' parties, trade unions, post-colonial and indigenous regimes, feminist and queer struggles, and anti-racist networks all challenged capital, subverting it for the purpose of gains for those oppressed the world over, linked together as a heterogeneous yet combined project aptly called communism. Using Marxism or anarchism for theoretical advantage, most goals were met, but the movement achieving them departed, leaving nothing but its shadow. Only in such an absurd world can a ruling communist party enact privatisation measures to continue its development.
Such a contradiction may indicate the natural impossibility of communism. Both Camatte and Fukuyama assert such, only differing on the political tasks, what to do next. The dilemma was no longer between socialism and barbarism, but capitalism and collapse. Yet, there's no reason to believe we are stuck, helpless to do anything. Humans are consciously social beings; though natural limitations are important, it is our consciousness which makes us capable of reflection on and practical alteration of our world. However, as social beings, we are acculturated by the environment we find ourselves in, the product of the contributions of our ancestors. The ideas in our heads, above all, come from this environment. Therefore, if a society has systematic strife and contradiction, the material forces which undo that contradiction must come from within. As a consequence, if we seek to radically change the world around us, we can't wish it away – we have to revolutionise it.
Clearly, there is no way back; regardless of whether the socialist transition was completed, there currently is no outside-of-capital, no permanent refuge from racism and patriarchy. However, all this means is that communists would have to directly overcome the totality, struggle their way forward. The continued existence of such struggle is self-evident.
Zapatistas. Piqueteros. Alter-globalisationists from the Genoa demonstrators to the founders of the World Social Forum. Feminists agitating for reproductive rights and to scrap sexist and transphobic laws off the books. Strikers and rioters from Guadeloupe to Guangdong. Arab Springers, Occupiers and students the world over against austerity. Their struggles come from different sources but are common. They immediately have international consequences and interests. They yearn to unify and intersect with other movements and groups, not just out of solidarity, but acceptance of the bare fact that the battles of the old era won the marginalised and oppressed a larger stake at the political roundtable. In short, these struggles run up against the capitalist totality. That totality, and the struggles against it, impact who and how we love, who goes to school and where, motivates decisions between profit and the environment, and when we fight and why.
Capital is not exclusively a matter of profits and wages. At the same time, that is its essence, in the sense that without profiteering and without wage labour, capital ceases to be. The lack of class perspective dooms any broad coalition acting towards social change, no matter how intersectional. A leader of the movement to close the wage gap may turn around to start a women-only business not only out of support, but because she knows the overall demand for her sisters' labour is lower, so she can profit even more than if she hired men. (This is especially true if there are racial or citizenship distinctions.) Likewise, recently assimilated workers, though they generally benefit from a struggle against nationalism, may vote to close the borders out of a fear of being laid off, sacked or otherwise becoming superfluous to the very thing which keeps them from abject misery – their salaries.
Two sides to capital, two modes of being. Though not as distinguished externally nor as homogeneous internally as they were in his time, Marx is still correct: there exists a bourgeoisie exploiting an existing proletariat. In other words, there exists one class whose main way of reproducing their livelihood is the perpetual accumulation of profit as money and/or means of production, and another class counter to it which lives, for the most part, by producing commodities (either as marketable goods or services). So long as the bourgeois gains more profits, the proletarian loses out on wages, and vice versa. Bourgeois have always and everywhere represented a minority of humanity. Proletarians, however, needed time to grow themselves, but in this era represent the majority of the population. Conceptions like a grand network of “buyers” and “sellers” or the precariat either ignore the different class experiences or treat a new mode of capital accumulation – acutely expressed as the diminished need for labour – as a new mode of production. Additionally, these perspectives express the fact that the very things which proletarians have in common with each other, or what individual bourgeois share, are what pit human against human within and between their classes.
Nevertheless, new language is necessary. Bourgeois and proletarian classes should not be understood as fixed categories, but groups implicated by processes of embourgeoisiement and proletarianisation. Individual vendors (i.e. self-exploiters), service workers and labourers in illicit markets still belong to the proletariat. Young startup engineers may have working class friends, but they are still bourgeois.
For most of modern history, from mercantile to industrial capitalism, up to the end of the colonial era, the old pre-capitalist powers, a nascent bourgeoisie, emerging proletariat, latent peasantry and slaves all existed, competing to live. Either to match the early capitalist states in Western Europe and America or just to keep afloat, revolutionary action on the part of all latter four classes brought to the world the hundreds of nations we know today. Which class took centre stage depended on which was most interested and capable of development and change at the given time. Whenever these revolutions came, the proletariat, fledgling as it was and itself a product of capitalism, would either lead the way or gain whatever concessions possible.
Now, communism has always meant the process of undoing capitalism (and, therefore, class), but it is historically sensitive. If capitalism means an alliance between the aristocrat and the bourgeois (who, often, were just parent and child), communists must totally expropriate the former and keep the latter from exploiting anyone until they too can be abolished as a class. It does mean taking some stake in capitalist relations, as the proletariat needed mechanised agriculture, liberal rights and advancements in productive technology. In the core and the rest of the “capitalist” world, these goals were worked towards via hegemony within liberal states and workers uprisings. However, there were more workers' states in the global periphery due to their working classes being the most poised to set up developmentalist regimes. This is a time when most of the world lived in colonies, and the proletariat was a minority. Moreover, the combination of a lack of automated production, the need for growing labour forces, and higher profit rates for capitalists made this much more possible in the past.
However, for better or worse, the social basis for these kinds of movements is gone. In the present, the proletariat is the largest class and contains the vast majority of the world's oppressed. Agriculture is either mechanised or turned into industrial-scale production of cash crops; consequently, hundreds of millions of farmers are most likely agricultural proletarians, not peasants. Fully-fledged markets and established bourgeoisies are found in all nations. Most devastatingly, in an era of overproduction, shrinking profit rates make both the liberal compromise and the socialist developmentalist regime prohibitive to maintain. The crisis in this movement shocked the liberal capitalist world first from the 1968-1977 struggles, but swept over the socialist countries even faster and more fiercely from 1989-1992. It was clear by then that proletarians are not tasked with their self-liberation, but their self-abolition as a class within the capitalist mode of production.
So, in a way, because the old tactics are not fit for this new world, we are at the beginning again, restructuring the communist project. But this is not turning back time, for history unfolded. Capitalist production, and its contending classes, did grow and spread worldwide. The lot of the oppressed did improve, however unevenly. Still there remains a struggle yet to be waged. The movements of the new era are teaching us how to fight unprecedented battles, establish fresh connections, and even expose a glimpse of the world incumbent on us to create. Communists know now that their movement can do nothing but obliterate all capitalist, and therefore class relations. It must rid society of gender distinctions, make racialisation impossible, undo alienation and competition, and settle the score between human needs and environmental pressures. It must do so not just as ends but as means. Communism is a challenge, but a welcome one. So come, workers and oppressed of the world, let us unite once more and win again!

2017 has been an amazing year, with more work having been put into the project than ever before, but it's not over yet! Last we met was June, and just two months later the Citra issue tracker is brimming with lots of changes once more. I am extremely excited about this month (and what's coming up the next few months) but we're getting ahead of ourselves! On this progress report, let's check out the big fish in the July and August pond of patches!
Updating The Software Renderer (This, that, here, there, and those) by wwylele and Subv
Citra has two main rendering backends, software and OpenGL, but until very recently, no one gave much attention to the software backend. The OpenGL backend is faster, makes better use of the GPU, and allows things such as texture forwarding for higher resolution rendering. But there is one thing on which the OpenGL backend falls flat on its face—accuracy.
However, wwylele has just revived the software renderer (inspired by an attempt Subv made prior), adding almost all of the features the hardware renderer had received over the years. In fact, every addition to the hardware renderer has been given an equivalent in software:
Feature Hardware Software Fragment Lighting #1264 #2766, #2822 Spot Lighting #2727 #2871 Geometric Factor #2776 #2872 Bump Mapping #2762 #2891
Despite the software backend being incredibly slow, it is important to have a complete software implementation of the 3DS' GPU so that Citra can be used as a stable, working, and complete reference implementation in the future, when obtaining a working real console may be much more difficult.
Citra emulates the 3DS system services at a high level of emulation, or HLE for short. What this means is that every time a 3DS application or game running in Citra makes a request to the 3DS System Software, Citra captures the request and tries to translate it into its PC equivalent, rather then running the 3DS System Software directly.
For example, if a game makes a call to FS:OpenFile , Citra in turn calls the operating system's file opening function ( _wfopen_s() on Windows, or open() on macOS and Linux), with the path to the virtual SD card added to the beginning.
Now, on top of the usual names for files and folders, there are two special folders inside every single folder on your computer, . and .. . These aren't actual folders in the sense that you can place files and other folders inside of them. Instead, they each symbolize the current folder, and the folder one level above it, respectively. For example, C:/Windows/System32/.. actually means C:/Windows/ .
With this in mind, a few Citra developers believed a game could, in theory, chain multiple .. s together to get to a file they weren't supposed to know even existed, like /../../../../Documents/IMPORTANT.docx . Citra would then ask the operating system to open the file %AppData%/Citra/sdmc/../../../../Documents/IMPORTANT.docx , which actually means that it would open C:/Users/Anodium/Documents/IMPORTANT.docx !
Before you suggest that Citra simply ignore .. , a game can use it for legitimate purposes. And if it were to use it, it would most likely crash, as the resulting file path wouldn't exist.
This was already handled for most file functions in Citra, opening, reading, writing, etc. except for a few things, like renaming a file. In this case, the malicious game could just ask Citra to change /../../../../Documents/IMPORTANT.docx 's name to /delicious_secrets.docx , effectively moving IMPORTANT.docx into Citra's virtual SD card! From there, the game could just ask Citra to open /delicious_secrets.docx to read the file it was originally forbidden from accessing.
This patch now fixes this, such that if any 3DS game or application tries to do exploit the rename file function from inside Citra, rather than doing what it asks, Citra gives them ERROR_INVALID_PATH , which most games interpret by crashing. So far, we haven't found any real 3DS software that tries to do this, but at least now future attempts to do so are blocked.
Do note though, that most of us are not security experts, and even for those who are, harderning the software is much more difficult and much less worthwhile than actually having an accurate 3DS emulation. The surface area of an emulation project is huge, and so writing malicious code intending to exploit one is not too difficult in any case.
But at the same time, malware authors generally target either the largest populations, or the most lucrative populations, and emulation is neither. And for the effort required to do so, most will only toy with the idea in their head, or maybe write a proof-of-concept for fun, rather than genuine malicious intent.
The 3DS GPU has a data transfer mode called TextureCopy , which as the name says, is for copying textures but with a configurable gap in case the texture is going to be copied into a smaller resolution area. This mode is enabled by setting the 3rd flag in the GPU and causes it to ignore every other flag except the 2nd, which is used to tell it whether or not to crop the texture.
This is nice because it can be used as a quick and easy way for 3DS developers to duplicate textures, and can be used in situations such as the one pictured running on hardware in Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon below. But when it came to running something that took advantage of this feature in Citra, it didn't always work the same as it would on console.
How jagged
Fortunately (and to much rejoicing!) wwylele stepped into the ring to wrestle with this issue. They prepared a test program to help gain an understanding of how the hardware handles the TextureCopy operation in comparison to Citra. After the hard work of doing the research was out of the way, wwylele implemented it in Citra.
Deoxys is having a bit of a hard time, no?
Ubuntu Linux 14.04 is the de-facto standard desktop Linux distribution. It's also old. Very old. So old, in fact, that the compiler it ships with can't compile Citra. And our buildbot, Travis CI, that automatically compiles and builds Citra from source, just so happens to use Ubuntu 14.04 VMs. :(
Formerly, we would update the compiler from a third-party repository before compiling Citra itself. This also had the side-effect of updating the standard library that comes with the compiler, as each compiler version is inextricably tied to the same version of library by design. Unfortunately, a recent update to the library was incompatible with a large majority of systems because it's too new for Ubuntu 14.04, breaking the Linux build once again.
Now, rather than building Citra directly inside Travis, a Docker container is started that's running Ubuntu 16.04 instead, which is much more well supported (and yes, it can compile Citra out of the box!).
Kloen has put the time and work into Citra's Qt frontend to make it themeable. Now users can enjoy a dark mode and other custom colour schemes, just by editing a CSS stylesheet!
CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER
This does not eliminate the need for dumping a shared font from a legitimate system.
This in itself isn't an extremely visible or perceivable change from a user perspective, but it is something that helps us take another stride towards accurately recreating the way the 3DS actually operates. All system data is uniformly stored in the system archive now that the system font can be included with it. Citra does still fall back to the deprecated shared_font.bin file if it was dumped before, for compatibility's sake. 3dsutil has been updated to be able to dump everything as a system archive, so that Citra may be able to work with it in a way that's more accurate to the actual hardware!
And Everyone Else
Just because your work wasn't written on here doesn't mean it's not as important! Every little bit counts, every pull request inches the project one step closer down the long road of accurately emulating the Nintendo 3DS. So I would like to give my thanks to everyone who's contributed these past two months, for giving us those extra metres down this road.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced Wednesday that an $81 million broadband stimulus grant and a $35 million government backed loan to Springfield-based Vermont Telephone Company (VTel). The $35,166,081 loan and $81,664,754 grant to VTel Wireless, Inc for their Wireless Open World (WOW) project is one of 49 broadband infrastructure projects announced nationally. The broadband investments will give rural residents in 29 states access to improved service that will expand economic, health care, educational, and many other opportunities to underserved rural communities. Today's announcement is part of the second round of USDA broadband funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act).
‘The VTell Wireless, Inc. project will give rural Vermont communities access to the tools they need to attract new businesses, jobs, health care and educational opportunities,' said Molly Lambert, USDA Rural Development State Director. ‘Bringing broadband to rural areas of the state provides a gateway for businesses and key institutions ‘ such as libraries, schools, public safety and community centers ‘ to provide services to thousands of people. Building the Wireless Open World network will create jobs and the completed system will provide a platform for rural economic growth in Vermont for years to come.'
The funding will allow VTel Wireless to design, engineer and construct the network, which will pass more than 57,000 homes and 3,700 businesses and provide jobs for an estimated 1,800 Vermonters. The company plans to use a model that proved effective in rural America during the Great Depression, called Rural Radio Farm Forum. They plan to send out teams of Rural Broadband Farm Forum field workers to organize several thousand neighbor-to-neighbor small-group meetings to discuss and show how broadband can help find jobs, improve schools, start businesses, access federal and state assistance, and enhance rural life.
VTel President Michel Guite said the federal funds will enable the company to build VTel's WOW system to nearly all of Vermont's unserved homes, businesses and anchor institutions; a one gigabit fiber network to VTel's existing customers; and a community visit program aimed at helping Vermonters identify ways broadband access can improve social and economic opportunities. VTel is contributing $30 million in equity to the project. Guite estimates the work will create as many as 1,800 jobs and build a platform that will offer thousands more Vermonters new economic opportunities for years to come.
US Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) said, ‘VTel and USDA's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) have partnered to build a game-changing network here in Vermont. This stimulus grant ranks among the most promising breakthroughs in rural economic development since rural electrification. This grant will directly impact the lives of Vermonters today ‘ whether they are hanging fiber, designing the network or getting access to broadband for the first time. This is an investment in Vermont's economy today that will also help shape Vermont's economic future. It will give Vermont a critical piece of the infrastructure that we need to prosper.' Leahy is the most senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over USDA and its Rural Utilities Service.
US Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said, ‘In the year 2010, every community in Vermont and America should have access to high-quality broadband service. This very large USDA grant from the stimulus package will not only put Vermont in a position of achieving that goal, it also will create hundreds of new jobs in our state. While much work remains to be done in sorting out the details and making sure that broadband access reaches and is affordable for all Vermonters, this is an important step toward achieving universal broadband access in our state.'
US Representative Peter Welch (D-VT), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet, said, ‘Today's announcement launches a broadband revolution in Vermont. Together with last month's broadband grants, this award to VTel will help Vermont leapfrog from one of the least connected states to one of the most. By building out our state's communications infrastructure, we will create jobs today. And by providing broadband access to businesses, community institutions and families, we will lay the groundwork for economic growth for decades to come.'
‘Vermont's success in competing for these valuable funds will help bring broadband and cell phone service to every corner of our state,' said Governor Jim Douglas. ‘I applaud VTel for its foresight and commitment to make long-term investments in Vermont. VTel's investments in wireless spectrum are one of the reasons they are so well-positioned to do this project. This award is a major milestone and I congratulate them for this achievement.'
Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie said: ‘As of today, the funding puzzle is finally complete for making broadband service available everywhere in our state. Vermont's e-State Initiative will be a reality, without new bonding authority or tax increases, but with a truly effective private-public partnership.' Now, he said, ‘It will be up to us to focus on implementing the plan and getting the job done.'
Dubie added, ‘This is a giant leap forward in our ability to retain, attract and grow good, new private-sector jobs all over our state.'
Leahy, Sanders and Welch wrote to USDA RUS Administrator Jonathan Adelstein in May highlighting the VTel proposal and other Vermont proposals.
Guite said the grant will allow VTel to offer high-speed Internet access over its wireless system to customers across the state ‘ including the Northeast Kingdom -- for between $10 a month for light users, and $35 a month for regular users. The grant will also accelerate VTel's fiber build-out to its existing customers, throughout 14 towns across Southern Vermont, which will enable those customers to receive as much as one gigabit of service. Guite says the funded project will also integrate Smart Grid improvements and will continue building VTel's statewide fiber network.
‘This is an almost breath-taking example of Senator Leahy, Senator Sanders, Congressman Welch, Governor Douglas, and Lieutenant Governor Dubie coordinating superbly, in a way that effectively brought more per capita ARRA job-creation funds to Vermont than came to almost any other state,' said Guite. ‘At VTel we are deeply grateful, and humbled by the scope of the challenge ahead of us. WOW brings next-generation mobile broadband wireless to every one of Vermont's 114,000 unserved residents, making Vermont the first state in America with universal Internet to everyone. In addition, WOW brings to every existing VTel customer the first Google-envisioned GigE-over-fiber-to-every-home network in the western world. Singapore is building the same, to be completed in 2014, and we hope to be done in 2012 or 2013.'
Springfield Regional Development Corporation Executive Director Bob Flint, who assisted VTel in developing the original proposal to reflect the needs of area residents and businesses, said the grant will have an immediate impact on the area economy: bringing new jobs to Springfield ‘ where VTel is headquartered ‘ and creating a long-term infrastructure that will help area businesses grow and will attract new businesses. "We're very excited to show how cutting-edge fiber capacity will stimulate economic activity and property redevelopment in our region,' said Flint. ‘VTel has been a leader for years, and we greatly appreciate our economic development partnership."
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the $116 million Vermont project as part of $1.2 billion in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act broadband grants awarded Wednesday that will invest in 126 broadband infrastructure projects across the country. An additional $117 million in private investments nationwide will be leveraged by these Recovery Act funds, bringing the total nationwide investment to $1.31 billion. The VTel grant and loan package account for nearly 10 percent of the national allocation announced Wednesday and is the second largest award announced today by Vilsack.
The award is part of a $7.2 billion broadband investment that was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The USDA Rural Utilities Service was charged with awarding $2.5 billion of those funds to expand broadband access in rural America. Last month, the U.S. Department of Commerce National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) ‘ which also administered a portion of the Recovery Act broadband funds -- awarded VTel a $13.7 million grant to expand the company's mid-mile fiber backbone and connect anchor institutions. The NTIA also announced a $33.4 million grant to the Vermont Telecommunications Authority (VTA).
Leahy, Sanders and Welch noted that with the announcement of these funds, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has invested more than $235 million in Vermont's utilities, including $69 million for Smart Grid improvements, $47 million in mid-mile fiber improvements, and $2.5 million in broadband adoption efforts.

France winger Franck Ribery has been struggling this summer with a recurring back injury, putting his World Cup hopes in jeopardy, French newspaper L'Equipe reported on Sunday.
Ribery was available on the bench for France's friendly on Sunday against Paraguay, but French coach Didier Deschamps said he hopes his top attacker can return for their next warm-up match against Jamaica next Sunday in Lille.
"Backache, it means everything and nothing," Deschamps said before the Paraguay match. "I'm not part of the medical staff, but everything is being done for a return in the best conditions.
"The objective is to make [Ribery] available and good for the last preparation match against Jamaica next Sunday."
Some reports on French television said Ribery would miss the World Cup, but L'Equipe said no decision has been made.
Deschamps must decide whether to include the Bayern Munich man in his final 23-man squad by Monday night.
France opens the World Cup on June 15 against Honduras, then face Switzerland and Ecuador in Group E.
In the first quarter of 2013, a third of smartphones sold in the U.S. were prepaid, double the amount from the previous year. Apple's share of the prepaid market? A mere 8 percent.
People are just trying to get the best long-term deal, says Stephen Baker at the NPD Group:
“In a quarter without a major product launch from either of the two market leaders, consumers refocused their attention away from the postpaid wars and toward finding the best value for their dollar.”
Those two market leaders, of course, are Samsung and Apple. But Apple is hardly even a participant in the prepaid market.
The portion of the market sold prepaid has been increasing for years, says Baker.
“Sales of prepaid smartphones doubled from the previous year, continuing a string of more than 12 quarters of triple-digit sales increases.”
Apple's share looks tiny, especially in a U.S. market where it has dominant market share, but it has quadrupled year-over-year since the first quarter of 2012. However, with the prepaid market growing so quickly, Apple's latest –and typically expensive — phones have not been the big sellers. Rather, it's the year-old iPhone 4S that is Apple's leading contender in prepaid, just as one of Samsung's top prepaid sellers is the now somewhat aged Galaxy S II.
Even outdated models get pricy — the iPhone 4S can cost $400 to $600 unlocked and brand-new, while the Galaxy S II can be between $300 and $400. But consumers make up the heavy upfront cost by saving on cheaper plans, potentially saving hundreds, if not a thousand dollars over the lifetime of their phones.
For Apple, however, capitalizing fully on this fast-emerging market trend means bringing out a cheaper iPhone that can be sold as a new, current model-year device at a price point closer to Android models from Samsung and LG. And Samsung has some work to do, too — while its market share remained stable from 2012 to 2013, competitors such as Apple and HTC have gained share.
Where are people buying prepaid phones? Mostly at retail, NPD says.
“Prepaid has proven to be a real winner for national retailers,” said Baker. “The easy purchase cycle and grab-and-go nature of the product play into the strength of large-format stores. Certainly, companies like AT&T recognize this shift in purchasing as they ramp up their focus on prepaid phones with their recently announced ‘Aio' product branding initiative.”
Capital market forecasting is going to be directly impacted by artificial intelligence technology, said Yaron Golgher, CEO of I Know First Ltd., a Tel Aviv-based AI capital markets forecast service.
Mr. Golgher spoke on Wednesday at a Fintech conference held in Tel Aviv by Calcalist, Israeli Bank Leumi, and accounting firm KPMG.
Founded in 2010, and employing about a dozen people, I Know First is a fintech company offering capital markets forecasting services based on a machine learning algorithm. The company's research and development team consists of Ph.D.s in mathematics and computer science, machine learning experts.
I Know First CEO Yaron Golgher
I Know First's algorithm generates short, medium and long term daily market predictions for stocks, commodities, ETF's, interest rates, currencies, and world indices for large financial institutions, banks, hedge funds and private investors. The company says it is currently tracking and predicting over 3,000 financial assets.
“Everyday our algorithm collects data from traditional as well as ‘alternative' databases. Our software adds this data to our database and analyzes it in light of existing data, continuously providing an updated forecast,” Mr. Golgher said.
“Our algorithm becomes better with every single forecast, enabling to adjust trading and improve results every time,” he added.
Mr. Golgher divulged that his company is currently working with a European bank to develop a personalized algorithmic model for its customers, and that I Know First's algorithm will become available in the Israeli market in the near future.
Clad in a tracksuit with an image of his No1 superhero Spider-Man, six-year-old abuse victim Jimmy (not his real name) and his peers play happily on the grounds of the Jakaranda Children's Home.
They are oblivious of the predicament facing the place they call home - it is not black enough.
Corporate donors that covered 70% of the Pretoria home's more than R25-million annual running costs have pulled out because, the centre says, the majority of children it houses are white.
Jimmy and 350 other children were removed from their parents because of abandonment, neglect and emotional and physical abuse.
They will soon have to survive without privately funded child development programmes, or worse, they could find themselves without a home.
"There's nothing we can do about it . it's a sad situation," the shelter's marketing executive Elzane van der Merwe says.
The children are victims of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, she says. The act stipulates that for companies to be allocated BBBEE points, they must donate to charities whose beneficiaries make up at least 75% quota of the previously deprived race groups.
At the Jakaranda shelter, 75% of the children are white.
For the past two years, the shelter received R7.1-million in government funding a year, which has been increased to R9.1-million for this year.
However, Van der Merwe says: "Without corporate funding we cannot continue with therapy and educational and sporting programmes. These are crucial to a child's proper development but without funding we will have to offer the basics like shelter, schooling, food and clothing."
She said companies still donate to the home but private funding had declined by 70% in the past three years.
Van der Merwe related an incident in which a company pledged R100 000 but pulled out at the last minute after realising that the majority of children were white.
She said the home did not decide which child was placed at the home. It got applications from social workers and the children were placed at the home according to their needs by the court.
The shelter's Ancha Smuts said: "With government funding, we could keep going but there'll be no extra development programmes."
Ancha urged companies to look beyond colour or BBBEE points and continue funding the NGO for Jimmy and other children's sake. Head of Childline, Joan van Niekerk, said the regulation was particularly problematic.
"We receive over a million calls a year from children and we deal with about 20000 online counselling [cases] but we do not see these children and we cannot say to a distressed child: 'We have reached our proportion, sorry we cannot help you'," she said.
And then finally, when Justin Morrow's penalty kick went off the cross bar, and Roman Torres' went past Toronto FC goalie Clint Irwin, the tension and angst and yes, agony, gave way to glorious release.
TORONTO — It was a night of almost unbearable tension, the Sounders virtually willing themselves to stay alive in the MLS Cup final, to give themselves a chance, somehow, some way, when they teetered all night on the brink of disaster.
“Agony,'' Seattle owner Adrian Hanauer would say later with a laugh, describing the mood for 120 minutes-plus of soccer — and the “plus” was where the ultimate glory came for the Sounders. Agony might be the right word.
The Sounders survived a flurry of scoring opportunities by Toronto FC, which has been an offensive juggernaut in the postseason but couldn't slip one past heroic Sounders goalie Stefan Frei.
They survived an anxiety-packed extra period that featured a save for the ages by Frei on a tantalizing shot by Jozy Altidore, a scoring machine for weeks. The ball was headed for the corner of the net, headed for a death blow to the Sounders' gritty comeback season, until Frei made a superhuman leap and barely tipped it away.
“You just try,'' Frei said of the moment that will be enshrined in the annals of Sounders — and MLS — history. “You try and see. Sometime you surprise yourself to what balls you can actually get.”
And the Sounders survived a round of penalty kicks that was the ultimate in that aforementioned agony, perhaps a goofy way to determine a championship but undeniably a riveting one.
And then finally, when Justin Morrow's penalty kick went off the cross bar, and Roman Torres' went past Toronto FC goalie Clint Irwin, the tension and angst and yes, agony, gave way to glorious release.
Then, you had the familiar trappings of ultimate success, predictable to anyone who has watched a title celebration but no less emotional when you see it play out in front of you. The Sounders, who didn't attempt a single shot on goal in regulation or overtime, are the champions of MLS, and they sang and danced and sprayed champagne in a giddy release made even more cathartic by the bumpy road that led them to the first title in franchise history.
Hanauer said that if someone had told him at midseason, when coach Sigi Schmid had been fired and the Sounders were mired near the bottom of the standings, that this of all years would be the year to hoist the cup … well, “I probably would not have believed them,'' he admitted.
“This was a rough year, but it just shows that in this league, anything can happen. You can make a midseason run and peak at the right time. What I'm most proud of, and Sigi talked about it in the past as well, is consistency. We put ourselves in position to win it eight years in a row, and this was our year.”
It capped an amazing turnaround under Schmid's replacement, Brian Schmetzer. The original Sounders coach, Alan Hinton, stood outside the locker room after the match, beaming with paternal pride, and told anyone who would listen, “I hereby anoint Brian Schmetzer king of Seattle!”
If so, then Frei is the crown prince after an MVP performance three years to the day after he was traded to the Sounders from, wait for it, Toronto FC. But after the match, Frei was initially concerned with something as simple as getting warm after enduring the brunt of a brutally cold night, unable to run around like his teammates.
“To be honest, after the game was done, I was so cold,” he said. “It was nice because it kept reminding me it was not a dream.”
Throughout the night, it was intensity writ large, as the Sounders became increasingly cognizant that they could not crack Toronto's defensive wall. So it became about relentless, desperate defense, throwing their bodies at the task with reckless abandon.
The Sounders, in fact, went the entire first half without a shot, and in essence finished the second half the same way, though they were credited with three on the sheet, none on goal, none offering any semblance of a scoring threat.
Toronto, on the other hand, was in a nearly constant state of attack, only to have Frei thwart chance after chance, seven in all — none more heroic than the one that will be shown for as long as soccer is played in Seattle.
Don't tell Frei he was the hero, though. He didn't want to hear that, at a time when he was hearing it a lot.
“I don't look at it that way,'' he said. “I did what I'm here to do. I made saves. That's it. We all worked our butts off today, under difficult conditions which made it maybe not the prettiest game, but we fought hard. We wanted to give it our best, and we did. It took everybody.
“I was happy to make it (the save), but a lot more was needed for us to make it to the playoffs, make it all the way to this game, and then come out with the victory. Everyone was magnificent and had their good moments that accumulated to this success.”
Despite the frigid conditions, with the lake effect off Lake Ontario in full force at BMO Field, the game sizzled with energy from the beginning as bodies crashed into each other and flew through the air. It would be easy to ridicule a scoreless tie in a championship game, but the delicious pressure that permeated the second half, and beyond, made it a spellbinding experience, lack of scoring be damned.
But the Sounders had to score sometime, and Brad Evans, Andreas Ivanschitz, Joevin Jones and Nicolas Lodeiro all put the ball in the net in the penalty-kick phase, leaving the two teams tied at 4-all after five rounds. In sudden death, the Sounders were suddenly given that chance they had been pushing for all night, willing themselves toward. The title was dancing in front of them when Morrow's shot went astray.
It was up to Torres, and he put it past Irwin to set off a wild celebration on the field.
“We were just joking, because yesterday in practice, (Torres) had a PK and missed it. I saved it,” Frei said. “He was pretty cool about it tonight, pretty calm. I was just praying to the soccer gods, and they answered.”

The number of teen drivers has dramatically decreased over the past couple of decades. In 1983, 69% of all 17-year-olds had driver's licenses. By 2008, only half of 17-year-olds had licenses. What's behind the big drop?
Researchers hypothesize that the rise of the Internet, text messaging, and other technology has made it easier for teens to connect with each other and socialize without the need of a car. The car culture of generations past has apparently been replaced, at least partially, by the e-culture of texts, Twitter, Netflix, iTunes, and Facebook.
The Detroit News reported that the study, conducted by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, showed a noticeable decline in young drivers, especially those in the 16- to 19-year-old range. There's a smaller proportion of 20-somethings on the road nowadays as well: In recent times, 22% of drivers were under age 30, compared to roughly one-third of the licensed-driver population in 1983.
(MORE: Prices for New Cars Are Cheaper. So Why Are Drivers Paying More?)
The shift toward an older average driver has to partly be explained by the general aging of the population. (By 2025, 20% of drivers on U.S. roads will be over the age of 65.) But researchers point out that the decrease in young drivers may be attributable to technology, specifically with regards to the way people interact today:
“It is possible that the availability of virtual contact through electronic means reduces the need for actual contact among young people,” said Michael Sivak, research professor at the U-M Transportation Research Institute. “Furthermore, some young people feel that driving interferes with texting and other electronic communication.”
Well, it most certainly interferes in that (hopefully) it stops teens from texting and driving at the same time.
The Los Angeles Times story about the study also theorizes that the modern-day costs and hassles involved in driving have made teens less likely to bother with driver's licenses:
Sivak's research appears to indicate that teenagers think traffic congestion and high fuel costs are the real nightmares, taking up time and money that could otherwise be spent on electronic communication.

The trend doesn't bode well for automakers, who have been trying to turn each generation of young people into lifelong car enthusiasts since the industry began.

Climate scientists frequently describe a tipping point at which the heating of Earth becomes irreversible, and the fear is whether we have already reached such a cataclysmic moment.
Perhaps it is time to ask if we are approaching an equivalent point in the decline of the traditional news media. Could we be facing a moment when the industry loses its capacity to act as an arbiter of truth for a significant enough proportion of the population that it has an irreversible impact on broader social stability? Could the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump be the social equivalent of melting glaciers and disintegrating Arctic ice shelves, ominous portents of a wider unravelling?
I raise the question as the latest strategy in the battle to defend newspapers is unveiled in the United States. The News Media Alliance, a US group that includes the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and nearly 2,000 other publications among its members, announced an effort to win the right to negotiate collectively with the likes of Google and Facebook, which are hoovering up the vast bulk of digital advertising at the expense of traditional news organisations.
US antitrust legislation prevents such collective bargaining, but the papers are arguing for dispensation. “If they open a unified front to negotiate with Google and Facebook – pushing for stronger intellectual-property protections, better support for subscription models and a fair share of revenue and data – they could build a more sustainable future for the news business,” according to an opinion piece by the alliance's president, David Chavern, in the Wall Street Journal.
I suspect neither Facebook nor Google is delighted to have the media's blood on its hands. It's not as if they set out to undermine the free press
I suspect neither Facebook nor Google is exactly delighted to have the media's blood on its hands. It's not as if they set out to undermine the free press when they drew up their business models. And although it may not be a priority for them, nor is it in their interest to see the news media collapse. Just last week Google pledged €21 million to European journalism projects, the latest instalment of its €150 million Digital News Initiative, in which The Irish Times is a partner.
I have been sceptical about the special pleading from sections of the media about the urgent need to protect it from technological disruption, but recent events make it impossible to ignore how the waning influence of the traditional news media is coinciding with a dangerous rejection of expertise and enlightenment thinking. Is it a coincidence that a sense of commonly held truths is fraying along with the news industry? Is it a coincidence that the penalty for public figures lying shamelessly appears to have evaporated at roughly the same rate as news-media revenues?
These reasons are exactly why the news media deserves special consideration – unlike, say, 19th-century textile workers or 20th-century travel agents. Journalists play a critical role in establishing fact from fiction.
This goes far beyond the overhyped threat from “fake news”, although it is related: bogus stories spreading online are a symptom of an uninformed populace rather than the direct cause.
A desire for impartial fairness should not blind us to the fact that the demand for bogus stories comes largely from the right
Viral stories peddling fabricated facts arise to satisfy a demand for narratives that bolster tribal identities, especially those viewpoints that would be undermined by too much exposure to facts. There is an uneven appetite for accurate depictions of reality, unfortunately, and a desire for impartial fairness should not blind us to the fact that the demand for these bogus stories comes largely, although not exclusively, from the right.
The capacity of large numbers of people to believe nonsense peddled by public figures and publications that proclaim to represent their tribal identity shouldn't surprise us. That's how most religions function, and humans have a fondness for religious belief that endures no matter what science tells us. But the phenomenon of some people insisting that their ignorance is as valid as other people's knowledge is deeply insidious and corrosive to society at large.
The wider threat from the disruption of newspapers and the rise of social-media platforms is a collapse in public faith in journalism
Whatever strategy the News Media Alliance devises to salvage a business model for US newspapers, the scale of the problem is fast extending beyond the mere death of a business model. I suspect that merely redistributing money from the likes of Google and Facebook to prop up newspapers will not suffice to tackle this problem, because the wider threat from the disruption of newspapers and the rise of social-media platforms is a collapse in public faith in journalism.
Truth has always been a contested currency, of course, but we need to recognise the degree to which the news media in its diverse forms has functioned as a reasonably effective arbiter of that truth.
Brexit and Trump are just a taste of the crises our society will suffer if truth and reality become increasingly contested, if ignorance and knowledge become equally valid in public discourse. It is telling that climate science is one of the areas where reality is most contested. With luck it is not too late to heed the warning signs.
Feminism has been blamed for everything from ruining marriages to destroying the social fabric of society.
Now the feminist movement is taking a hit for the rise in infertility rates. In The Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism and the Reality of the Biological Clock (Prometheus Books), Tanya Selvaratnam writes that when she tried unsuccessfully to have a baby at the age of 37, the cruel reality hit her that while she'd been concentrating on her career, her biological clock had been ticking away.
Selvaratnam writes that she delayed motherhood because feminism encouraged her to get an education and develop her career, a misleading message that she says ultimately caused her much pain. The problem with the author's thesis is that it's wrong.
Feminism's message was never that women could or should delay motherhood as long as they wanted. The message of feminism, and always has been, is that women should have more choices. Period.
It's time to set the record straight on exactly what the feminist movement did achieve. Let's travel back to the 1960s when the second wave of feminism rippled in with Betty Friedan's groundbreaking book The Feminine Mystique. Her book exposed the life of the bored suburban housewife who was living what Friedan called "the problem that has no name."
Friedan's message was that women needed to have more choices beyond motherhood. It was a message that was picked up by feminists such as Gloria Steinem, who gave a voice to issues such as rape, wife abuse and sexual harassment.
Feminists held a critical gender lens to issues and brought about an awareness that has lead to sweeping changes. Women now have far more career choices, such as law and medicine, than women in the 1960s did, and issues affecting women, such as eating disorders, child care and reproductive freedom, became part of the national dialogue.
Unfortunately, while women's lives have changed, a host of other factors stayed the same. So if you want to look at the real culprits behind the struggles women are facing, here are a few suggestions:
Your employer:
Since more women began working outside the home, the biggest change that never happened was in the workplace. Policies such as flextime, part time and telecommuting are still in short supply and going on the mommy track can be career suicide. As a result, many women are working two shifts and are tapped out. Meanwhile, companies rigidly adhere to old-school work schedules and remain blind as to how much talent they're missing out on.
Washington, D.C. – Oct. 6, 2015 – U.S. News & World Report, publisher of Best Colleges for more than 30 years, today released the 2016 edition of the Best Global Universities. The rankings help students evaluate higher education options worldwide as well as by region, country and subject. U.S. universities remain the global leaders among research institutions, with Harvard University claiming No. 1, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at No. 2, the University of California—Berkeley at No. 3 and Stanford University at No. 4. U.K. universities take the next top spots with the University of Oxford at No. 5, followed by the University of Cambridge at No. 6.
The following countries have the most ranked institutions out of 750 schools on the overall Best Global Universities list:
United States: 181
China: 57
United Kingdom: 55
Germany: 50
Italy: 38
"Students are increasingly looking outside their own countries for educational opportunities," said Anita Narayan, managing editor of Education at U.S. News. "As international education continues to evolve, U.S. News will be at the forefront of the conversation – providing comparable information across global institutions and presenting it in bite-sized pieces for students and their families, just as we have done for three decades in the U.S."
The second edition of the Best Global Universities rankings are more comprehensive, including rankings of the top 750 universities – up from 500 last year – spread out across 57 countries. U.S. News has published new university rankings of larger countries including India and Brazil, and smaller countries such as Belgium, bringing the total number of country-specific rankings up to 32. The 2016 edition also debuts a regional ranking for Africa, adding to the previous four regional rankings, and features a new subject ranking for arts and humanities, bringing up the total to 22 subject rankings.
These countries, listed in rank order, performed best in the following subject rankings:
Arts and humanities: U.S., U.K., Netherlands (tie), Australia (tie), Germany
Clinical medicine: U.S., Germany, U.K., Italy, Canada
Computer science: U.S., China, U.K., Canada (tie), Hong Kong (tie), Australia (tie)
Economics and business: U.S., U.K., Canada (tie), Netherlands (tie), Australia (tie)
Engineering: U.S., China, U.K., Canada, Australia
The Best Global Universities methodology – which is based on data and metrics provided by Thomson Reuters InCitesTM research analytics solutions – weighs factors that measure a university's global and regional reputation; academic research performance using bibliometric indicators; and school-level data on faculty and Ph.D. graduates. Each subject ranking has its own, similar methodology.
"We have designed the rankings to be a starting point to help students and their families identify institutions that speak to their specific needs, whether they are planning on staying close to home or traveling abroad for college – or whether they are seeking a specific academic degree," said Robert Morse, chief data strategist at U.S. News.

Data Science Fundamentals for Marketing and Business Professionals (video course demo)
This is kind of a special blogpost, because here I share 3 videos from my brand-new O'Reilly Video course – called Data Science Fundamentals for Marketing and Business Professionals. It has been published on Safari Books Online. There is a free 10-day trial period, so if this is your first time there, you can watch my 60-min course practically for free. (Then you can still decide if you stay with them or not. 😉 )
Regardless:
I've decided to share 3 vids on my blog as well to help you decide, if you are interested or not. The course has been created to clarify the basics of Data Science and Analytics – mainly for marketing and business professionals or just in general – for aspiring Data Scientists and Analysts! Enjoy!
VID#1 – Data Scientist or Data Analyst?
TRANSCRIPTION:
Statistics and mathematics are indispensable for Data Science and Analytics.
However it's also true, that different data projects need different levels of statistical knowledge.
One of the most common questions I get from aspiring data professionals is:
“What's the difference between a Data Analyst and a Data Scientist?”
First of all – you have to know that the term Data Science recently became a buzzword. Thus you can find a wide variety of data topics under the umbrella of Data Science – especially in online articles. Because of that, unfortunately there is no clear definition on how data science and analytics are different.
However you can see a clear pattern in job descriptions, that at least illustrates the small differences between Data Scientists and Data Analysts.
For instance when companies are hiring a Data Analyst, they are usually looking for a person who will be working on research projects, on optimization and on reporting. This person will help the company to understand their customer base and flag possible issues and future opportunities.
When a company is looking for a Data Scientist, it usually wants someone on board who's good at predictive analytics and who has experience with machine learning and similar advanced methodologies. This knowledge can be useful for managing risk, for building recommendation systems, for optimising resources, for face recognition and many-many more things – depending on the profile of the given company.
As I see it, Data Analytics is usually mentioned as the conservative part of the data projects and it has a big effect on the business side – while Data Science is more progressive and it can even have an effect on the product itself.
Note that – in my opinion at least – both of these roles are equally important.
I'll give you a concrete example. Let's say, we have a video sharing portal. Our Data Analytics team will create reports on how many video uploads we received, and who are our best users; they might also do A/B tests to find the best placement of the UPLOAD button.
On the other hand the Data Science Team will build the algorithms behind the recommendation system that autostarts the next video – and they might do churn predictions too.
As you can see the line is blurry, but this is the high-level concept.
In terms of required coding skills, business skills and domain knowledge, the difference between a Data Analyst and a Data Scientist is not substantial. It's good to know though, that a Data Analyst – as it's closer to the business part – might need better business skills, while a Data Scientist, who has to implement complex methods, might need better coding skills.
However the biggest contrast between the two is mostly in the statistical and mathematical methods that they apply during their data projects.
Let's check out that what statistical tools Data Analysts and Data Scientists need!
VID#2 – SQL demo
TRANSCRIPTION:
If you want to be a data analyst or a data scientist: SQL is a must.
Almost every company is using it.
Let's take a look at a simple SQL query:
SELECT * FROM zoo WHERE animal = ‘zebra';
This query is almost fully understandable if you simply follow common sense.
We want to SELECT – everything – FROM – the data table that is called zoo – and we want to see every row WHERE the animal that we are talking about is a ZEBRA.
Alright. Let's see, what working with SQL looks like.
I'm using a free SQL query tool called SQL Workbench.
The first thing I'll do is query my whole data table:
SELECT * FROM zoo;
Again: the asterisk refers to “everything”. You can see all the rows and columns of my data table. There are different animals like zebras, elephants or tigers in it. Each of the animals has a unique identifier and one additional piece of information: water need.
If we want to filter for zebras only, on the top of our base query we have to type:
SELECT * FROM zoo WHERE animal = ‘zebra';
With that we made sure that only those rows are showing up, where the field in the animal column is ‘zebra'.
But let's say, that we don't want to select all the columns anymore! We need only the water needs. For that, I am going to change the asterisk to the name of the column: water_need
SELECT water_need FROM zoo WHERE animal = ‘zebra';
Note that as the WHERE clause is still there, I got back the water_need information only for my zebras. Perfect!
At last let's summarize the water needs for all the zebras.
SELECT SUM(water_need) FROM zoo WHERE animal = ‘zebra';
There you go! 1720 is the water need of all the zebras in my zoo.
And this is how SQL works: you simply select a piece of information from a table. It can be raw data like unique id or water need. And it can be an aggregate, like SUM or AVERAGE – in these cases SQL does the calculation for you. You can also filter for specific subsets of your data.
You might have noticed that SQL has some very specific syntax rules too! Did you see the semicolon at the end of my queries? That's a must in SQL. If you miss it, your query won't run properly!
This semicolon gives you freedom as well. For instance: you can break your query into more lines without any trouble. You can also add as many spaces as you want to. These will help you make your code more readable and easier to change.
For instance my previous query can look something like this too:
SELECT SUM(water_need) FROM zoo WHERE animal = ‘zebra';
If I re-run it: the results won't change.
Of course this is only the tip of the iceberg – and there is much more in SQL, but at least now you got a taste of how the syntax looks. Not scary at all, right?
(Note: learn SQL for Data Analysis through my tutorial articles!)
VID#3 – Intro
TRANSCRIPTION:
…
I'll cover four topics in this course. The first three – coding, statistics and business thinking – are the 3 pillars of data science and analytics. Then I'll have an extra chapter focusing on how to go further on the road you have just started on by taking this course.
I'll show you demos, examples based on real life scenarios and will share some of my best practices that I've collected during my years working as a data analyst. Additionally – for each chapter I'll give you a comprehensive list of specific resources for further learning.
By the end of this course you will understand:
what data scientists and analysts do, how they work, and how they think
what tools and data languages are essential for data science and analytics
what soft skills are essential
how to communicate better with data professionals
and how to determine the first steps toward becoming a data professional
I hope you will enjoy it!

LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Over the past year, a brutal criminal gang has waged a campaign of terror in Australian suburbia.
There've been murders, shootings, knee-cappings and extortion carried out by gangsters wearing the insignia of "Brothers For Life", a gang founded in prison by one of Australia's most notorious criminals, Bassam Hamzy.
The convicted killer gained notoriety when he was caught using a smuggled mobile phone to run a violent drug network from his prison cell.
Despite a crackdown, 7.30 has learned he's been able to continue his activities, even though he's still behind bars.
Until now, a sweeping court suppression order has prevented us from bringing you this story. Today key parts of that order were revoked, lifting the veil of secrecy on Hamzy and his gang.
Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop has this exclusive report.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP, REPORTER: It's October, 2012 in south-western Sydney. On a quiet Sunday afternoon, two gang members pull up in a Mercedes. They're waiting on a suburban street in Greenacre to meet with their boss. They've been summoned here. They're in deep trouble over a drug debt. But they have no idea what's about to happen.
27-year-old Yetya Hahmoud was one of seven men from Sydney's south-west brutally executed in the same number of months.
JAMAL RIFI: I had to attend too many funerals and I had to go to Rockwood Cemetery too many times in the recent past. We want this to stop.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: The body of Yetya Hahmoud remained at the scene for hours next to a crucial clue: the numberplate on the bullet-riddled car bore the tell-tale initials "BFL", meaning Brothers For Life.
CLIVE SMALL, FMR NSW ASST POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well it was Brothers For Life for sure. And it was a statement of authority and a assertion of power.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Police are going into battle against the Brothers For Life. Officers were dressed for a warzone when they arrested this man in February over two shootings. The Brothers For Life insignia he's wearing, showing two AK-47s, is modelled on the colours worn by bikie gangs.
JAMAL RIFI: We have seen the Brothers For Life insignia worn around and especially at time of funeral and times of tensions. Probably is sending a message to someone else within the community: "Don't come near me. I am part of the BLF, so be afraid of me and be very afraid of me."
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Dr Jamal Rifi is a local GP and community leader. In his clinic he hears the stories of a mounting number of victims, innocent bystanders and grieving family members.
JAMAL RIFI: Well a lot of people who these killing taken place in their street or around the place, they're definitely suffering from acute post-traumatic stress and unfortunately it's progressing to a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Unfortunately they are perceived that they are in a warzone.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: The Brothers For Life gang was founded in jail by convicted murderer Bassam Hamzy.
PETER SEVERIN, NSW CORRECTIVE SERVICES COMMISSIONER: He has certainly been assessed and identified as highly manipulative, as quite influential outside the prison system as part of a broader network.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Hamzy grew up on the streets of Kings Cross, a drug addict for most of his teenage years. At the age of 19, he gunned down a teenager on a Sydney nightclub strip. Hamzy was jailed for 21 years for murder.
He was sent to Australia's highest security prison, the Supermax.
CLIVE SMALL: He converted at some point to radical Islam and while in jail was able to draw in a number of younger people - adults, but younger people who'd been jailed, draw them in to converting to radical Islam and around that conversion, built himself a strong gang while he was in the jail.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Hamzy was moved to Lithgow Jail and into segregation. But in 2008, guards spotted this on security cameras: a mobile phone being passed between cells on a line of dental floss. Police started listening in. They discovered Hamzy was running an extensive criminal enterprise through his relatives.
CLIVE SMALL: Found to be making something like 450 calls a day. So that shows the extent of the communication.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: From his jail cell, Hamzy was trafficking drugs from Sydney to Melbourne, a quarter of a million dollars worth in trucks every week.
He flew his cronies to Melbourne and Adelaide to carry out two kidnappings and a shooting.
The intercepts of Hamzy's calls are chilling. 7.30 can now reveal details of the phone taps after a court ruling today.
BASSAM HAMZY (intercepted phone call, male voiceover): "Can you slap him once in the face?
INTERLOCUTOR (male voiceover): "I've already done it, cuz. I've already chopped him. I've got blood everywhere, mate."
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: In this call, Hamzy directs a violent kidnapping. He demands $30,000 from the victim.
BASSAM HAMZY (male voiceover): "They're gonna cut your fingers off. After they cut your fingers off, I'm gonna cut your ears off, alright?"
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Hamzy's next victim owed him $20,000. Once again, Hamzy directs the torture from his prison cell.
BASSAM HAMZY (male voiceover): "Put something in his mouth. Tie his mouth up so he can't scream. He's lucky I don't put a bullet in his head. If I ever have to come up there again, I'm gonna cut all his fingers off. Next time I'll take his ears and make them into a necklace."
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Bassam Hamzy was sent back to the Supermax, thrown into solitary confinement and designated as Australia's first and only extreme high-risk restricted inmate.
PETER SEVERIN: You're' dealing with a person who's very manipulative. He's very bright. Somebody who obviously is determined to not only beat the system, but to continue committing a crime or having an influence outside the corrections system while he's serving a sentence.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Late last year prison guards discovered Hamzy had once again got hold of a mobile phone. 7.30 understands it was one of several he'd recently had access to in jail.
PETER SEVERIN: He has been doing that, as I understand, to continue to engage in illicit behaviour outside prison. That is a very serious matter and certainly one that we are extremely concerned about. He became wind of the fact that the staff were searching specifically for a mobile phone and literally within seconds before that could be secured, he flushed it down a toilet bowl.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: Fellow prisoners claim Hamzy's cronies have got the phones into jail by standing over prison guards, threatening to harm their families and paying them for their help. Hamzy has also had disputes in jail which have allegedly been spilling onto the streets.
Police allege that in March a former fellow inmate who'd fallen out with Bassam Hamzy tried to kill his aunt. Nearly 30 gunshots were pumped through her front door.
One of the bullets hit a neighbour's house.
WOMAN: My young brother was sitting, playing PlayStation like any normal kid would do. He was lying down with a pillow and he come, like, really close to the pillow, like, really close to his head.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: The BFL have also been targeting the wider community.
JAMAL RIFI: I know of many cases, large sums of money were asked, $50,000 for protection money and for extortion and people, if they don't pay, their livelihood will be affected. We have seen that places been burnt down, places closed or people were forced to relocate. ...
... There is a perception that these people are somehow untouchable. And they fear if they're gonna go and give some information to the police, that there may be some retaliation, someone may knock the door on them and shoot someone else.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: The NSW Police have reached out to their counterparts in Lebanon to help crack the wall of fear.
RONY GHANEM, INTERNAL SECURITY FORCE, LEBANON: We are afraid now if there's some connection between these guys here and the guys of Lebanon - in Lebanon, some relationship between them.
SEAN RUBINSZTEIN-DUNLOP: For the past two months, Bassam Hamzy's legal team has fought to prevent details of his crimes from being published, but today the Court of Criminal Appeal has pulled back on a sweeping suppression order. And tonight, 7.30 can report that Bassam Hamzy will spend another 22 years in jail for his crimes. The question is whether that will curb his power.
CLIVE SMALL: The violence will still be there. His gang is still there. They will be exercising violence whenever they need it to survive and whenever he tells them.
LEIGH SALES: Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop with that report.
Garrrrggg!!! The goblins roared as they crashed into the elvish city gates of Penca. Hundreds of three foot tall, goblins smashed into the large wooden doors over and over with their shields. The goblins in the back pushing up against the goblins in the front breaking ribs of ones that were caught in the middle. A few goblins pass out from lack of oxygen. The city gates creaked louder than the war cries of the goblins. elves atop the city gates shot arrows down at the goblins, there was no need to aim. If they shot an arrow at the horde of goblins, it was sure to hit. Bastian was among the elves shooting two sometimes three arrows at a time. He would load his bow and shoot in a fluid motion like a wagon wheel turning. The goblins piled so high they could almost reach the top of the gate.
The gates were not going to hold much longer. goblins were strong for their size and brute. The creaking grew louder and louder before a loud POP!. The gates flew open.
Goblins came rushing into the city screaming obscenities at the elves. They torched anything that could burn and slashed at anything living that they came across. Goats bled out on the ground, dogs were thrown into fires, and cabins were set ablaze with elvish people still inside.
Goblins were normally pale green but when they were filled with anger, their skin would turn dark red. Their hatred for the elves was unprecedented, a mere mention of anything having to do with elves around a goblin was enough to turn them. One of the goblins grabbed a teenage elvish boy by the shirt.
“Let me go you red twat!” The child screamed.
“You're not going anywhere” the goblin responded looking up at the child.
Even elvish children towered over goblins by at least two feet. Three other goblins grabbed ahold of the boy pulling at his arms in separate directions.
The boy screamed “Help me! My arm! It's going to break!”
The boy's father came running from behind a cabin and elbowed one of the Goblins and kicked the other one. Pulling the boy to the side he told him “Run! get to the citadel!”
The boy hesitated for a moment before running North up the stone mello steps that ran for half a league toward the Citadel. Five Goblins surrounded the elvish man, with shields and swords the goblins paced. One looked at the others, smiled before dropping his weapons.
“Let's show this tree fucker what we do with his kind.”
The father elf turned to run towards the Citadel. One goblin jumped on his back biting him on the shoulder. The other four goblins grabbed a hold of both arms pulling as hard as they possibly could.
“Gaaaahhh!” The father screamed. He lifted his head up looking towards the Citadel hoping that his son was safe.
“Turn em around” A goblin spoke.
Still stretched as far as they could the goblins turned the elf to face another goblin. Abnormally large for his kind standing at least four feet high with thick arms and legs.
“Meet... The Ox” one goblin said whispering and laughing in the fathers ear.
The Ox took a few steps back before sprinting towards the elf.
The Ox lowered his shoulder and rammed into the elf's chest ripping and taking the elf's body with him. The Ox raised his arms in victory and let out a roar. The other goblins held the elf's severed arms in the air before rushing over to the bloody torso of the dead man and began beating the corpse with his own arms.
“Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself HAHAHA!” the goblins laughed hysterically.
Bastian had stayed atop of the gate tower shooting arrows. One by one, goblins fell to the ground with arrows through their hearts or head. He was reaching to take another one out when suddenly TWAK!, his head rammed into one of the stone pillars that held the roofing over the tower.
Bastian drew blood from his nose, he turned around. A goblin held a small wooden shield up at Bastian with a short sword in the other hand. Bastian reached for an arrow but the goblin had already lunged at him. Bastian swayed to his right slapping the goblin's arm out of the way. He pulled an arrow from his quiver and the goblin lunged at him again, he moved to the left this time and the sword nicked his arm. Still holding the arrow he jabbed it into the goblins left eye. The goblin made a loud shriek and reached for the arrow, the goblins arms trembling. Bastian reached up grabbing one of the beams on the ceiling, he lifted his self up and kicked the goblin in the face forcing the arrow through the eye and out through the back of the goblins head. The impact threw the goblin back and over the railing of the tower falling fifteen feet to the ground below. The eyeball laid only a few feet away from him.
Bastian was tired, bloody, and afraid, but there was no time to rest. He heard the sound of a goblin war-horn.
Looking out from where it came from he saw the source. Another horde of goblins was approaching fast. A hundred more at least, heavy armored with steel plates they had stolen from the dead of the common folk army. In addition, three bears approached. A few of the goblins were riding in saddle on top of them. Bastian reached for an arrow, his quiver was empty. He grabbed the wooden railing and jumped down from the tower landing on his feet with a roll. When he raised his head he saw the goblins screaming and running away green-faced as they made their way back out through the city gates.
Bastian heard the sounds of horses galloping. When he turned to find that, the Elvish Century Elves had arrived from the Citadel. They galloped through the goblins running them over and shooting arrows at them. Slicing at them with their swords was incredibly difficult from horseback, which they had learned long ago. The leader of the Century Elves was Gristle, the greatest fighter in all of Japrite. Long silver hair that came down to his elbows, and armor so shiny it could almost be used to blind his enemies.
“Run them down,” Gristle said, signaling his men. Twelve riders kicked their horses and took off after the retreating goblins. Arrows flew through the air sticking goblins as they cried in fear. Even the bears turned around retreating like scared puppies throwing their masters off their backs. One of the goblins foot was caught in the saddle and was being dragged through the field. The other two bears were trying to run away so quickly that they were taking out whatever goblins were in its path. Bastian stood there watching as the Century Elves did more in thirty seconds than the elvish guards did all year.
The twelve riders chasing the goblins away had returned.
“How many of ours were killed?” Gristle said in a sympathetic tone.
“Four sir” Another century men said stepping out through the gate.
“And a merchant... Human, from... Warren”
Very well, clean all this up” Gristle commanded as he turned his horse and rode back to the Citadel.
Groups opposing 22 May coup banned from displaying three fingers in the air as Thai junta clamps down on protest
Thailand's military rulers say they are monitoring a new form of silent resistance to the coup – a three-fingered salute borrowed from science fiction blockbuster The Hunger Games – and will arrest those in large groups who ignore warnings to lower their arms.
The raised arm salute has become an unofficial symbol of opposition to Thailand's 22 May coup, and a creative response to several bans the ruling junta has placed on freedom of expression.
"At this point we are monitoring the movement," said Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, a spokesman for the ruling junta. "If it is an obvious form of resistance, then we have to control it so it doesn't cause any disorder in the country."
Since staging its bloodless coup, the military has prohibited political gatherings of more than five people and tried to enforce a ban on criticism of the coup by closing politically affiliated television stations and blocking hundreds of websites.
On Sunday, authorities deployed nearly 6,000 soldiers and police in Bangkok to prevent planned protests against the coup. Amid the heavy security, small flash mobs appeared in a central shopping district where the salute was unveiled for the first time.
Asked what the symbol meant, some protesters say it stands for the French revolution's trinity of values: liberty, equality, fraternity, while others say it means freedom, election and democracy. A photo montage circulating online paired a picture from The Hunger Games with a graphic of three fingers labelled, 1. No Coup, 2. Liberty, 3. Democracy.
In the book and movie series, the salute is a symbol of rebellion against totalitarian rule and stands for thank you, admiration and goodbye to someone you love.
"We know it comes from the movie, and let's say it represents resistance against the authorities," Weerachon said, noting that if authorities encounter the salute they will first ask protesters to stop.
"If a single individual raises three fingers in the air, we are not going to arrest him or her," he told the Associated Press. "But if it is a political gathering of five people or more, then we will have to take some action."
"If it persists, then we will have to make an arrest," he said.
Social activist Sombat Boonngam-anong, who has helped organise anti-coup protests, posted an explanation of the salute on his Facebook page along with a call to step up the silent acts of defiance.
"Raising three fingers has become a symbol in calling for fundamental political rights," wrote Sombat, a member of the "Red Shirt" protest movement that had backed the now-ousted government and warned it would take action if there was a coup. He called on people to raise "3 fingers, 3 times a day" in public places where there is no police or military presence.
"Let's escalate the anti-coup movement three times a day together," he said, stipulating that protesters should raise their right arm and stay still for 30 seconds.
Celebrity chef Mario Batali came under fire for including a recipe for pizza dough cinnamon rolls in a statement apologizing for his alleged sexual misconduct.
Batali, 57, issued a statement Friday though his newsletter, apologizing for his past misconduct after he was accused earlier this week of inappropriately touching his former employees.
“I have made many mistakes and I am so very sorry that I have disappointed my friends, my family, my fans and my team," Batali wrote, according to BuzzFeed. "My behavior was wrong and I take full responsibility."
Batali ended the letter saying he would “work every day to regain your respect and trust.”
WALMART, TARGET DROPPING MARIO BATALI'S PRODUCTS FROM STORES
However, the chef was not finished. Batali added at the end: “In case you're searching for a holiday-inspired breakfast, these Pizza Dough Cinnamon Rolls are a fan favorite.”
A picture of the rolls and a link to the recipe were also included.
Tina Brown, the former editor of the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, slammed Batali during an interview on CNN on Saturday, suggesting that the chef offer readers a different recipe.
"How about pigs in a blanket, Mario?" she said, adding "sorry Mario, this ain't the right kind of apology."
Brown later tweeted that Batali's apology was "bungled."
Social media users also slammed Batali for including a recipe in a letter regarding serious matters.
“You know Mario Batali is very serious about changing his behavior because he included a recipe for pizza dough cinnamon rolls with his apology for sexually assaulting women,” one social media user wrote.
“When you're apologizing for sexual assault and suddenly need a snack,” another person tweeted.
“Well, sorry about the harassment, try this recipe for pizza dough cinnamon rolls! Is an interesting message,” another Twitter user wrote.
MARIO BATALI CUT FROM ABC'S ‘THE CHEW'
Eater NY published Monday a series of accounts from three of Batali's former employees and a fellow chef who accused Batali of groping or inappropriately touching them. In the following days, more people came forward with similar accusations.
Following the accusations, Batali was fired from ABC's “The Chew” and his products were dropped from Walmart and Target.
Following the initial accusations, Batali released a statement apologizing for his actions, in which he takes “full responsibility” for the inappropriate behavior.

Me tiene de pésimo humor todo el desmadrito que están armando por lo de Top Gear, lo mismo que pasó cuando al infeliz italianito se le ocurrió decir que las mexicanas somos bigotonas.
No entiendo cómo podemos tener tanta capacidad de indignarnos por pendejadas, no tengo tele, pero si tuviera y sobre to-do si me interesara ver los programetes pendejos de Televisa, seguro vería a Andrea Legarreta junto con las otras 2 cotorras con las que “conduce” quejándose amargamente y pidiendo una disculpa pública porque les dijeron “Gordas Pedorras”
La realidad es que en México si hay muchos huevones, tenemos el primer lugar en obesidad, muchas empresas como IKEA no quieren entrar a nuestro país por nuestros altísimos niveles de corrupción y además aceptémoslo o no, los frijoles son una parte importantísima de nuestra dieta y CHIN los frijoles provocan pedos. Y volviendo a lo del pobre italiano crucificado hace tiempo SI hay chingos de bigotonas y mujeres horrendas. Sólo hace falta darse una vueltecita por las calles para constatar que no somos precisamente la más hermosa de las razas.
Si no quieren que el mundo piense que somos unos gordos huevones entonces NO le muestren esa imagen, la gente sólo ve lo que hay, lo que a través de años y años nos hemos encargado de construir, nosotros mismos bromeamos sobre nuestra manera de hacer las cosas sólo para salir del paso, al ahí se va. Sólo hace falta ponerse a ver el canal del congreso para constatar el inmenso nivel de huvonez de nuestros funcionarios públicos.
¿Qué les ofende tanto? ¿Qué les indigna? ¿Que les digan sus verdades de manera cínica y burlona tal como nosotros estamos acostumbrados a expresarnos? Creo que no hace falta recordarles que en cuanto sucede algo trágico en el mundo los mexicanos somos los primeros en burlarnos, en Twitter leí infinidad de chistes sobre TRAGEDIAS como lo de Haití, Chile y las inundaciones de Monterrey. ¿No es más indignante que seamos capaces de burlarnos de miseria y el dolor de otros seres humanos?
Además como lo he dicho siempre, tenemos 8,000 cosas más importantes por las que indignarnos y NADIE hace nada, siguen muriendo mujeres en Juárez, los niños de La Guardería ABC siguen sin obtener justicia, personas como “El Gober Precioso” andan bien campantes por la vida, pero ahí si nadie se indigna, nadie la arma de pedo.
¡Qué grande es nuestro ego! ¡Cuanta importancia le concedemos a “insultos” idiotas que nosotros mismos nos merecemos porque ESO PROYECTAMOS y cuán fácil es para nosotros dejar en el olvido lo que es realmente importante!
¿Consideran racistas los comentarios de los de Top Gear? ¿Saben que los mexicanos somos un país súper racista? Pregúntenle su opinión de nosotros a los inmigrantes de Centroamérica, verán que lo que los gringos nos hacen y por lo que tanto chillamos es lo mismo que le hacemos a los guatemaltecos, salvadoreños y de más centroamericanos que llegan a nuestro país en busca de un futuro mejor.
En conclusión, si, tal vez para ellos somos un país de gordos, flojos, mujeres bigotonas, probablemente un chingo de pedorros, corruptos y si, TAMBIÉN nosotros somos racistas. Si no queremos que los extranjeros tengan esa imagen de nosotros en vez de andar como niñas chillonas pidiendo disculpas públicas a conductores que antes de han burlado de muchos otros países (burlas que nos causaron risa y NO indignación) les recomiendo que si tanto les caga que los consideren así, mujeres, depílense el bigote, pónganse a dieta, hagan algo para cambiar esa imagen que proyectamos y dejen de estarse quejando por pendejadas, porque tal parece que por este tipo de cosas estúpidas es para lo único que no les da hueva andarla armando de pedo.

Imperfect fruits and vegetables are being promoted by grocery stores and organizations like endfoodwaste.org, whose social media campaign includes a stream of misshapen produce photographs on its Twitter feed, @UglyFruitAndVeg.
In October, the organization helped create what was billed as the Woodstock of food waste in Oakland, Calif. — a meal for 5,000 people from food that would have otherwise been thrown out before it made its way to the grocery store.
Later this spring, a former Trader Joe's executive will open Daily Table, a restaurant and grocery store in Roxbury, Mass., that is dedicated to ugly fruit and food past its sell-by date. Even in Europe, where classic dishes like pot-au-feu or the Tuscan soup ribollita sprang from a history of kitchen efficiency, 2014 was declared the year against food waste, a move that came six years after the European Union lifted its ban on selling produce that was knobby, excessively curved or otherwise misshapen. Last year, the French grocery chain Intermarché took things one step further and started a campaign to celebrate and sell what it called “inglorious fruits and vegetables” with special pricing and ads.
Dan Barber, the chef and author, is so dedicated to ending food waste that he is turning his Greenwich Village restaurant, Blue Hill, into a pop-up in which every dish is based on waste. It's an extreme extension of what many chefs already do.
“The best restaurants today are focusing on how to utilize what's unknown and largely uncoveted,” Mr. Barber said. “That has turned dining on its head so fast we tend to not even recognize it.”
For his project, which begins on March 13, Mr. Barber and his cooks are putting kale ribs into a pressure cooker and turning them into vegetable rice and deep-frying skate bones with fish-head sauce for dipping. He has created a burger from the vegetable pulp left over from a fresh juice company. He tops it with cheese trimmings from Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont and serves it with pickles made from cucumber butts and ketchup rendered from beets rejected by plant breeders at the University of Wisconsin.
Even the food left on diners' plates at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, his restaurant in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., feeds the restaurant's laying hens.

Australian Council of Social Service blasts plan to offer tax cuts to those earning $87,000-plus, while Deloitte says those on less than $37,000 need more help
The Australian Council of Social Service has criticised the Coalition's plans to cut taxes for the top 20% of taxpayers while simultaneously slashing welfare payments for the country's poorest households.
Acoss has labelled the government's Income Tax Relief Bill 2016 “unconscionable” and called on parliament to reject it, in a submission to a Senate inquiry.
At the moment taxpayers earning between $37,001 and $80,000 a year have a marginal tax rate of 32.5 cents for every dollar they earn over $37,000.
Welfare groups calling for Newstart increase 'lack imagination', says minister Read more
Taxpayers earning between $80,001 and $180,000 a year have a marginal tax rate of 37 cents for every dollar they earn over $80,000.
The Turnbull government wants to give “tax relief” to three million Australians by extending the 32.5-cent marginal tax rate from $80,000 to $87,000.
It will provide a tax cut of $6 a week for people earning more than $87,000 a year.
Acoss says this is unconscionable because the government is also trying to cut payments to Australia's poorest households.
It says parliament should reject the tax cut plan because it is unfunded – costing the budget an estimated $4bn over four years – and will therefore have to be met from more spending cuts or borrowing.
“The [tax cut plan] is being considered at the same time as legislation – mostly carried over from the 2014 budget – to cut $7bn over the next four years from social security payments, mainly affecting people at risk of poverty,” the Acoss submission said.
“If passed, those bills would cut $60 a week from the income of a sole parent with two teenage children and $47 from the income of a 23-year-old applying for unemployment benefits.
“Any income tax cuts should be paid for by closing shelters and loopholes in the personal tax system, as has been done in the past.
“We advocate tightening of the tax treatment of capital gains, negative gearing, superannuation, work-related deductions and private trusts and companies to save approximately $12bn a year, half of which could be used to finance future personal tax cuts, for example in 2020 when the impact of ‘bracket creep' is more significant.”
The government wants to lift the marginal tax threshold from 32.5 cents to 37 cents to insulate middle income taxpayers from so-called “bracket creep” – where inflation pushes them into higher tax brackets.
The government announced the plan in its 2016 budget.
At the time Scott Morrison said the tax cuts were about “providing room in our tax system” for average full-time wage earners to earn more without being taxed more.
“Of course we would like to do more but this is what we can afford today,” he said.
The Greens treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, told Guardian Australia that he would not support the tax cuts, “especially while the drums are beating for another crackdown on income support”.

“If the parliament gifts $315 a year to those who need it least, it won't be long before the Liberal government starts screaming ‘budget emergency' while coming after assistance payments for those who really need our help,” he said.
Deloitte Access Economics, in its submission to the inquiry, said taxpayers with incomes between $30,000 and $37,000 a year actually faced the greatest challenge from bracket creep.
It also said that, given the current fiscal environment, the government should consider restricting the benefits of tax relief to the tax bracket targeted – for those earning between $80,000 and $87,000.

Introduction
One theory about the origin of the childrenâ€™s poem, â€œJack and Jillâ€, is that it was a stealth protest against actions by King Charles I of England during his reign from 1625 until his execution in 1649. Details about what happened are sparse on the web, but apparently, when the Parliament refused to allow a tax increase, Charles responded by reducing the volume of a standard unit of measure, â€œthe jackâ€. In the measurement system of the time, two â€œjacksâ€ comprised â€œa gillâ€. All other things being equal, this volume reduction would have increased revenue from the existing tax law.
The theory is that the people were afraid to complain openly on the topic, so they devised the poem, â€œJack and Gillâ€ as a stealthy form of protest. Sometime later, Gill became Jill.
(incidentally, itâ€™s off topic for this article, but how different is Charlesâ€™ action from todayâ€™s dollar inflation by the U.S. Federal Reserve?).
This story brings to mind two ideas which are relevant to the â€œsame sex marriageâ€ debate.
First is the idea that language evolves. Language is a tool for enabling communication among people. Over time, as our societies change, language evolves with them so that it can continue to accomplish its purpose. â€œGillâ€ becomes â€œJillâ€. â€œSuperhighwayâ€ changes from a slab of blacktop and concrete to a network of copper and fiber-optic cables. Consequently, efforts to control language are efforts to control thought.
Second is the propensity for government to meet its insatiable appetite for income and control by bending the rules and meddling in places where it doesnâ€™t belong. Parliament had approved a tonnage tax, but it wasnâ€™t yielding enough revenue. King Charles couldnâ€™t get the peopleâ€™s representatives to approve a tax increase, so he nudged the measurement system to make an end-run around the people.
Two Forms of Thought Control
For most history, the word marriage meant neither a personal choice, nor a union permitted and controlled by the state. It was a financial arrangement between families. As our society evolved, the word marriage came to apply to an individual choice. Even in nineteenth century America, the word was used by some to represent polygamous relationships. In some cultures, unusual relationships are still included, today, in the definition of the word.
Somewhere along the way, in our culture, the word, “marriage” was captured by the state. Now, because the word has been captured, two groups of people are engaged in a massive struggle to forcibly control the wordâ€™s definition.
Etymology is the study of the history of words, where they are from, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. – wikipedia
Without interference from powerful institutions, it is the nature of words and language to change in meaning over time. The current debate over same-sex marriage is an effort to exempt the word, â€œmarriageâ€ from that natural linguistic process.
Worse! It is an effort to dictate our thoughts to us. For some of us, the word, â€œmarriageâ€ means a union between a man and a woman. For others, it means a committed relationship between consenting adults. Like Charles changing the size of the jack, whichever belief we hold, there are people who are actively working to coerce — not persuade, coerce — us into changing our beliefs.
Normally, there is absolutely nothing controversial about words with multiple meanings. We manage to survive as a society with all sorts of multiple meaning words. We even have a name, homographs, for these words. For instance, do I play catch with a ball or do I attend a ball? I donâ€™t need the state to tell me what I mean when I say, â€œballâ€. If there is additional need for clarity, linguistic conventions might gradually and peacefully replace â€œattend a ballâ€ with â€œattend a partyâ€.
Rather than let linguistic nature run its peaceful course on the meaning of the word, “marriage”, two groups of thuggish activists now want to short circuit that process and tell us all what to think. No matter which meaning they promote for the word, this attempt at thought control is objectionable. Personally, I will not have my thoughts dictated by force of law from either of these groups.
Marriage is a Private Matter, Between Individuals
In the debate over whether to legalize gay marriage, both sides are missing the point. Why should the government be in the business of decreeing who can and cannot be married? â€“ David Boaz
The ninth amendment to the U.S. Constitution says, â€œThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.â€ And the tenth amendment says, â€œThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.â€
In light of these two amendments, and the fact that regulating marriages is not a Constitutionally delegated power, it should be clear that the power to regulate marriage is reserved to the States, or to the people. It should also be clear that the right to be married is retained by the people.
As Boaz points out, if marriage were privatized, the governmentâ€™s role would be limited to contract enforcement. Several standard contracts would likely emerge and people would be free to choose the contract of their preference. As Wendy McElroy wrote, â€œA legal marriage is whatever contract for a committed relationship is agreed to by those involved.â€
This model is the only one that accommodates freedom of thought and action. Beyond enforcing the terms of a voluntary contract, there is absolutely no reason why government should be enforcing or subsidizing anyoneâ€™s morality or attempting to control anyoneâ€™s thoughts.
As with all questions of law, there are two levels of government to consider.
Although I believe it is brutish, I must grudgingly admit that state governments are authorized by the Constitution to legally define and regulate marriage. Contrarily, the federal government has no Constitutional voice on the matter, whatsoever.
Conclusion
Same-sex marriage is contentious, primarily for two reasons. 1.) State and federal governments have created financial incentives to promote marriage, including tax breaks and other subsidies; and 2.) Two powerful groups of people are aggressively trying to dictate our thoughts to us.
The position of liberty in this debate is clear. Marriage should not be a matter of interest to the state, except in the realm of contract dispute. Instead of working to establish thought control over one half, or the other, of our country, people should be looking for ways to stop subsidizing an individualâ€™s private decision and to free the word, marriage, from institutional capture.
While the states do have the legal, Constitutional power to legislate on the matter, they are ethically wrong to do so. The people should be free to utilize contracts and language of their own choosing.
While I do not like the idea of state governments defining marriage, this issue demonstrates clearly another reason why the Tenth Amendment is important. Different states can legislate the matter differently, and the people can â€œvote with their feetâ€, withdrawing the consent of the governed, on issues which are important to them. In the winner take all world that would exist without the Tenth Amendment, this important capability would be taken away from us!

Despite announcing his retirement from Formula One racing, Mark Webber will be back on track at Albert Park during Australian GP week.
The Australian driver will take to the track on two feet when he helps to launch the Champion Edge program with a track run around the Grand Prix circuit on Tuesday 11 March at 5pm and will be joined by a crowd of students.
“It's been 12 months since I've been on the Albert Park circuit but instead of being behind the wheel of an F1 car, this year I'll be lining up on the grid in my running shoes with a group of energetic teenagers,” Mark said.
Champion Edge is a new motivation and education program with a focus on health and fitness for 13-16 year old Australians. The program was developed by leading educators, health & fitness experts and motivators and is designed to inspire teenagers to find their own formula for success in life through motivational seminars, social media community, physical challenge events and an online learning tool.
“The 2014 Formula 1® Rolex Australian Grand Prix will provide a fantastic backdrop to launch this initiative and I'm sure all the teenagers who are involved will enjoy the experience.
“It's going to be very different for me to be back in Melbourne during the Australian Grand Prix week and not racing, but I'm looking forward to completing a lap around the circuit, albeit at a slower speed.”
To find out more about the program and how students can join Mark at Albert Park for the run:

CROSBY, Texas - The fire burning at Arkema's Crosby plant was extinguished early Saturday morning, according to plant officials.
An Arkema spokesperson said Saturday there are still concerns additional containers could reignite.
There were plumes of black smoke and flames shooting into the air on Friday in the 18000 block of Crosby Eastgate Road.
Explosions from chemicals, and it was all as expected according to the company responsible for the chemicals.
"One container became engaged then the heat from that container is what actually initiated and ultimately fire from the second container," Richard Rennard, with Arkema, said. "This played out like we'd expected it to."
Two trailers burned, housing what Arkema Inc. said are organic peroxides.
One trailer burned Thursday.
After Friday's fires, six more trailers remain that are likely to catch fire.

"The product is going to warm up. It's going to begin to downgrade and then it's going to catch fire, just like it did today (Friday)," Rennard said. "The storm came in very quickly, water rose very quickly. We didn't feel like we were going to be in a situation where all of our redundant levels of protection were going to be compromised."
They catch fire because they can't handle being stored in hot conditions.
Arkema said the chemicals were stored in a warehouse facility, which was temperature appropriate.
Once Harvey knocked out power, backup generators were brought in.
VIDEO: Officials provide update on Arkema situation
Then the facility flooded, killing the generators.
The chemicals were then stored in trailer trucks, which don't have refrigeration.
An employee from a company called Dexter Field Services, out of Beaumont, was at the perimeter set up around the plant Friday.
The company tests air quality, among other things, according to its website.
Officials also said the Environmental Protection Agency is testing the air and water.
Arkema said the burning that's occurring is not toxic.
They also said this was the worst case scenario they didn't see coming.
Arkema issued the following statement Thursday:
"At approximately 2 a.m. CDT, we were notified by the Harris County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) of two explosions and black smoke coming from the Arkema Inc. plant in Crosby, Texas. Local officials had previously established an evacuation zone in an area 1.5 miles from our plant, based on their assessment of the situation.
"We continue to work closely with federal, state and local authorities to manage the situation.
"As we communicated in recent days, our site followed its hurricane preparation plan in advance of the recent hurricane and we had redundant contingency plans in place. However, unprecedented flooding overwhelmed our primary power and two sources of emergency backup power. As a result, we lost critical refrigeration of the products on site. Some of our organic peroxides products burn if not stored at low temperature.
"We have been working closely with public officials to manage the implications of this situation, and have communicated with the public the potential for product to explode and cause an intense fire. Organic peroxides are extremely flammable and, as agreed with public officials, the best course of action is to let the fire burn itself out.
"We want local residents to be aware that product is stored in multiple locations on the site, and a threat of additional explosion remains. Please do not return to the area within the evacuation zone until local emergency response authorities announce it is safe to do so.
"Organic peroxides are a family of compounds that are used in a wide range of applications, such as making pharmaceuticals and construction materials."
Rennard said that when the plant was shut down Friday ahead of the storm, the company left behind a team of 11 people to ride out the storm and ensure the safety of the chemicals. He said that team was later evacuated after the failure of the refrigeration units.
While the fire is burning, residents near the facility might be exposed to smoke and other combustion irritants.
Harris County officials said residents should stay indoors, close all windows and shut off air conditioning.

"Pikachu, I choose you!"
With those words, 400 Pokémon players from 26 countries around the world will vie Saturday and Sunday for the title of World Champion in the 2010 Pokémon Video Game Championships in Kona, Hawaii.
Kids and teens compete in two age groups by playing the "Pokémon HeartGold" and "SoulSilver" versions of the titles available on the Nintendo DS console.
U.S. champions and qualifiers will do battle against winners from competitions in Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain.
The U.S. competition started in May and lasted two months before crowning 11-year-old Wade Stanley of San Diego, California, and 16-year-old Wesley Morioka, of Chicago, Illinois, as champions in the Juniors and Seniors age groups.
The Pokémon universe is made up of more than 490 creatures that players can find, capture, train, trade, collect and use in battle against their rivals in the quest to become Pokémon Trainers.
Each Pokémon is classified by a specific type -- such as Fire, Water, Grass, Psychic, and Fighting -- and each has its own set of strengths and weaknesses to create a rock-paper-scissors-style balance.
In the video games, players collect and befriend Pokémon from the wild and train them to battle each other. Pokémon are never seriously harmed in these battles; they merely faint, returning to their Poké Balls to rest and be fully healed at a later time.
The Pokémon video game franchise has continued to enjoy great success since its inception in Japan in 1996 for the Game Boy handheld console.
It arrived on the shores of the United States two years later and spawned a craze that created cartoons, card games, movies and more than 20 more video game titles.
It is the second most successfulvideo game franchise of all time (Mario is first) with more than 207 million games sold worldwide. Their recent titles, "HeartGold" and "SoulSilver," have sold 8.4 million copies worldwide, including 2.2 million in the U.S., since their release in March 2010.
JC Smith, director of marketing for Pokémon, says the lasting draw of the game is its characters and storyline.
"The games provide a type of way to experience the world -- the story of adventure, training, being the best," Smith said. "It is a compelling world that draws players in."
Smith said the franchise allows players to play seriously but still have fun. He said there are players who like the strategy and the competition of the battle as well as collectors who enjoy exploring the vast Pokémon world in an attempt to "catch them all."
Junior Champ Wade Stanley said he just thought it was fun.
"I've been playing for about three years and I'm 11 years old now," Stanley said. "It just looked good for my age at the time and I was just having fun."
Senior Champ Wesley Morioka "blames" his uncle and aunt for getting him hooked on Pokémon 11 years ago.
"I received my first Game Boy as a present from my uncle and aunt from Texas when we went down to visit them," Morioka said. "As we started to play the games we got with it, we decided to stop at a store to buy other games and we saw Pokémon and decided to buy it."
Both Stanley and Morioka said they put a lot of thought into their Pokémon teams for the competitions and practice against older siblings because no one their own ages will play them.
"The only person who will battle is my sister, Tiffany," who is 17, Stanley said. "Because everyone else is going to lose."
Morioka thinks he's put in about 2,000 to 3,000 hours of actual game play over the past 11 years, not counting time spent researching, planning and practicing. He said battling against unknown people makes the game fun for him.
"I love the whole anticipation for upcoming tournaments and to see how the training, time, and effort finish at the end of the day," he said.
Smith said the competitions give the kids a sense of purpose for all the hours of play they put into Pokémon. At the events, the kids enjoy being around people who love the same thing they do.
"The depth of the game is unbelievable," Smith said. "Side quests, collecting, there is just so much to keep you entertained and [make you] fall in love with the characters."
Last year, Jeremiah Fan of San Jose, California, defeated Japan's Santa Ito for first place in the Junior Division. In Senior Division, Japanese champion Kazuyuki Tsuji beat teammate Tasuku Mano for first place.
Morioka was confident about bringing home the Senior Division trophy, but Stanley was a little less confident about his chances for the Juniors title.
"I feel like I'm going to get matched up against the Japanese who always do well," he said. "But I'm going to prepare and I'm going to be ready."
Pokémon has been holding championship tournaments for its video game version and the trading card version since 2004.
Chris Gayle
There's the Universe Boss, then daylight, then every other T20 batsman who has ever played the game. Gayle's list of records in the format is simply awe-inspiring - more than 10,000 T20 runs (almost 2500 more than the nearest challenger), 18 centuries (no-one else has made more than seven), the highest total (175 not out), the fastest a hundred (30 balls), the most sixes (743 and counting)… you name it, he's bossed it.
Virat Kohli
In the multi-millon-dollar goldfish-bowl of modern-day Indian cricket, it takes a cricketer of unrivalled stature to absorb the pressures of performing day-in, day-out in front of the most demanding fans in the universe. Kohli has done just that, across formats and franchises, leading the line for India and RCB alike with a ferociously brilliant attitude that carries the attack straight back to every bowler in the game. He is the face of the modern-day game, and he's not just a pretty one at that.
Viv Richards
The Master Blaster never had the chance to play T20 cricket, but just imagine how cowed the world's bowlers would have been had he done so. The most imperious batsman ever to play the game, Viv would swagger to the middle in his maroon cap (no helmet for him, no matter how ferocious the bowling) and intimidate with the merest gum-chew and jutting-jawed stare. His 56-ball Test a hundred against England in 1986 remained a record for 30 years; his 189 not out in an ODI against the same opponents at Old Trafford in 1984 was a hint of what he could have achieved in this bat-dominated era.
AB de Villiers lays into a pull shot BCCI
AB de Villiers
The arch-exponent of 360-degree batting, de Villiers makes boundaries from deliveries that his predecessors would have been pre-conditioned to write off as unplayable. Second only to Gayle among overseas heroes at the IPL, de Villiers' most destructive moment came in an ODI against West Indies in Johannesburg in 2015. With flick after flick for six over fine leg, he rattled along to a 31-ball hundred, and a 149 from 44 balls all told.
MS Dhoni (wk)
The keeper of the galaxy's wickets, and the coolest, most calculating finisher the format has ever known. No runs/balls equation can ever faze Dhoni, who captained India to the inaugural World T20 title in 2007, before hitting the winning six in the 50-over World Cup final four years later. If he's still batting when the match reaches its climax, woe betide the bowling side.
Garry Sobers
The greatest allrounder in the sport's history, and the most versatile weapon that any T20 team could hope for. His formidable power with the bat is legendary - just ask Malcolm Nash, whom Sobers launched into outer space with six sixes in an over at Swansea in 1968 - but just imagine trying to face his lethal variations with the ball. Hooping swing from a left-arm line with the new ball, or tantalising orthodox spin if the conditions demand. And he was also a mean wristspinner to boot. Then, throw in his ability to catch flies in the outfield, and it's little wonder that no less a judge as Don Bradman described him as a "five-in-one" cricketer.

Wasim Akram
Arguably the most skilful fast bowler the galaxy has ever seen, Wasim was another who missed the T20 revolution but who would surely have dominated given half a chance. His finest moment (or two) came in the 50-over World Cup final against England in 1992 - a stunning two-card trick to Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis, bowled past the outside and inside-edge respectively, as he snaked Pakistan to the title with peerless command of reverse swing. And, as a hard-hitting batsman who once struck 12 sixes in a Test-best 257, his ability to biff the beejaysus out of the death overs wouldn't have gone amiss either.
Shane Warne
Arguably the greatest spin bowler in the universe, with one of the greatest game-brains ever conceived, Warne's command of line, length and revolutions was second to none, while his ability to keep cool under fire transcended formats. T20 cricket came too late for him to showcase his fullest repertoire but, as an ever-conniving captain of Rajasthan Royals, he chivvied his unfancied squad to the inaugural IPL title in 2008. With an endless repertoire of variations - some real, several imagined - he would doubtless have outpsyched a host of hard-hitting sluggers in his pomp.
Malcolm Marshall: a weapon for every situation Getty Images
Malcolm Marshall
With his sidewinder approach, searing pace and skiddy action, Marshall was arguably the most unnerving fast bowler the world has ever known. The most skilful member of West Indies' pace battery of the 1980s, Marshall's unerringly accurate bouncer would spit like a cobra before any batsman had enough time to size up its length, but it was his ability - in his latter years - to throttle back the speed and concentrate on devious swing and cut that underlined what an intelligent player he was. He'd have had a weapon for every situation, not least - one suspects - when guarding his team at the death.
Derek Underwood
"Deadly" Derek Underwood was nominably a slow left-arm bowler, but his pace through the air was startling at times and, with the exception of his peerless Kent sidekick, the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, few players at the business end ever had the measure of his bottomless bag of tricks. He was at his most lethal on drying wickets in the days of uncovered pitches - witness his mopping-up of Australia at The Oval in 1968 - but he could adjust his pace and flight to suit any surface. He was a mystery spinner before anyone had even coined the term.
Lasith Malinga
"Slinger" Malinga honed his extraordinary round-arm style as a means of skidding tennis balls out of the surf on the beaches of his native Sri Lanka, and he's been bamboozling generations of batsmen throughout a long and storied career. In an era when opponents like to get "under the ball", via ramps, slogs and lofted drives, Malinga's almost subterranean line of attack instantly ups the ante, and few deliveries are more deadly than his low-slung wicket-to-wicket yorkers. He's the only player to have claimed three ODI hat-tricks, and even made it four in four balls against South Africa at the 2007 World Cup.
There is nothing weirder, wilder, or more magical than a baby's movement in utero. For many mothers (it certainly was for me), the quickening, those first flutters, are the moment when a pregnancy starts to feel real, when a bump becomes a baby. And as the pregnancy progresses, with each kick and stretch and rollover, the physical and emotional connection between mother and baby grows.
Naturally, men want in.
Now in Sweden, the Scandinavian diaper brand Libero is providing a way for partners of pregnant women to share in the experience of baby's movements. After two years of product design and development, Libero's BabyBuzz—billed as “the world's first pregnant bracelet”—is ready and promises to help Swedish couples “share every pregnancy more intensely,” by alerting a woman's partner of in-utero kicks with a buzz on the wrist.
It works like this: A pregnant woman and her partner both wear smart bracelets, hers enabled with a button, her partner's with a buzzer. When the child kicks, or punches, or hiccups, the pregnant woman pushes her button, and her partner's bracelet vibrates. The bracelets have to be connected to an iPhone app via Bluetooth and are actually just SMS messages—so like texts, but without the ability to communicate anything other than BZZZZ, though users have the option of sending a short or longer vibration, to replicate the intensity of the movement.
As part of the rollout, Libero released a short documentary highlighting the experiences of three product testing couples. All first-time parents, the young adults explain, with unbridled sincerity, how the constant connection of BabyBuzz has engaged them in a way that an actual text or a conversation never could:
“As a man, you feel helpless in the situation, because there's nothing you can do. Sure I can reassure her, talk to her, maybe bring her a warm blanket or something,” one fellow says, describing, in fact, lovely ways to connect with one's pregnant partner. But there's something special about that vibration.
“If I can feel my wristband vibrating…It feels like I own the situation,” a track-suited, bearded, father-to-be says over tape of him running through a snow-covered landscape. “You start imagining. You haven't been kept out by her describing it. And that…this is mine. My kick. Completely.”
Not only does the buzzing inspire a sense of ownership of the physiological phenomenon once only enjoyed by pregnant women and those with hands to place upon her, the BabyBuzz—an identifiable FitBit style bracelet, also works as signal to the world: a kind of “Ask me about my pregnancy” jewelry.
“A lot of people have come over and asked what that thing is,” one partner explains, bemoaning the fact that before his bracelet, he always had to bring up the fact that he was an expectant father first. “I always had to make an active effort,” he said.
According to Libero, the impetus for the BabyBuzz was expecting women who posted on its forums the desire for their partners to be more engaged. A follow-up survey of 4,000 Nordic parents conducted by the diaper company reported that a quarter of pregnant women felt alone during their pregnancies and six out of ten said they were more involved in the pregnancy than their partners.
This sounds nice enough, but the Swedish advertising agency who came up with the idea of BabyBuzz described the wearable's actual purpose in less altruistic terms: “Find a way for Swedish diaper brand Libero to establish a relationship with expecting couples who are not interested in diapers yet.” In other words, create brand loyalty before there's even a product to buy.
Corporate motives aside, problems with the BabyBuzz abound. Most glaring is the technology itself which relies solely on pregnant women to report these movements. So along with growing a human, most likely holding down a full-time job, possibly caring for other children, going to doctor's appointments, and dealing with a grab-bag of physical ailments including aches, insomnia, and incontinence (just to name a few), mom-to-be is now tasked with fetal check-ins to make sure her partner is connected with her experience. It may be only a button to push, but that's one more thing, one more person to constantly take care of. The documentary suggests a pregnant woman should document these kicks “in real time.” To put that kind of assignment in perspective, on average in the third trimester, that equates to an electronic communique every 12 minutes.
In 2013, American diaper brand Huggies commissioned the design of a smarter, yet more impractical product for use in a tear-jerking Father's Day commercial. Instead of bracelets, expecting parents wore electronic belly bands. Sensors on the pregnant woman's signaled kicks by setting off LED light bursts and vibrations on the the father's band, corresponding to the placement and force of the movements.
But even if the responsibility for connectedness didn't fall on a pregnant woman's aching shoulders, the notion that mothers and their partners must feel identical sensations in order to bond is not only unattainable, it's misguided, and to be lumped with the terrible idea of shocking fathers with electricity so they sympathize with the pain of childbirth.
As one dad in the documentary put it, “You want to do this together, you know? You don't want to be left out.” But the truth is, you don't get to do everything. While fathers miss out on the truly extraordinary sensation of carrying a child, they also get to sit out on the disfigurement and the hemorrhoids. Dads may not get the belly conversation piece, but they also avoid having their tummy groped by strangers. Hefty vibrating bracelet or not, you too, are not pregnant.
Despite its limitations, BabyBuzz is here. Though it isn't for sale—yet.
For now, Libero is loaning the bands out to expectant parents who sign up for their free program, and agree to return them after the birth of their baby. But Libero's parent company, SCA, announced last year that the goal of the BabyBuzz program was a “commercial product” for Nordic markets. To be sure, Sweden is an extremely daddy-friendly, egalitarian country where the concept of sharing in every moment of pregnancy may be more strongly desired. (Unlike the U.S. which has no paid leave policy, Swedish parents are entitled to a whopping 480 days of paid leave, three months of which are reserved just for dads.) Still, with the rise of wearable tech and the boom of pregnancy and baby gadgets that no parent or child actually needs, it's only a matter of time before BabyBuzz is available stateside.
At this very moment, women and their partners can purchase products that effectively turn babies into Tamagotchis, allowing them to track their new baby's oxygen level, heart beat, sleep rhythms and feeding schedules. There are smart onesies, smart bottles, smart diapers, smart formula dispensers, smart pacifiers, smart cribs, and smart thermometers. As such, the BabyBuzz or something like it will surely reach our shores and the The Internet Of Things will fulfill its Manifest Destiny by finally reaching into the uncharted territory of our uteri.
Of course not everyone is so cynical. My husband and a few dad friends I spoke to agreed there was something sweet, if gimmicky and unrealistic, about the idea. And one expert told me the only downside he could see was driving partners being distracted by the buzzing.
“Fathers are more engaged and involved in their children and family's lives than ever before,” said Dr. Craig Garfield, an Associate Professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Director of Research at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. “Research shows that children with involved fathers have cognitive, psychological, and social benefits and fathers enjoy the involvement. It is a win-win. And fathers are often the number one source of support for mothers during the pregnancy and beyond.”
Asked about the BabyBuzz, Dr. Garfield, a dad and expert in the benefit to families of involved fathers, told me, “It is important to remember that from the moment a woman knows she is pregnant she and her partner are dreaming of that baby. They talk about it, they think about it, they try and anticipate that baby coming. So a device like this can help fathers get on board earlier. Woman have an obvious outward change in their bodies; men not so much. So a buzz like this can literally create buzz about their expected baby.”
“The more moms and dads can be on the same page, the better their adjustment to having the child will likely be,” Garfield said.
Indeed, as one of the Swedish fathers in the documentary puts it, “[BabyBuzz makes] you feel that you're more a part of it. When it vibrates—like it does—then it makes you, like, think about the baby.”
Americans might take more convincing.
“Somehow running down a windswept Nordic streetscape and pausing mid-jog because my watch started buzzing isn't going to do that much to ‘connect me to pregnancy,'” my friend David, a Queens, NY, father of two responded after I asked him to watch the BabyBuzz video.
“Also, going out at 11:30 p.m. because my wife had a craving for ‘crappy pizza' made me feel like I was already pretty connected.”
Applicants must also speak English or Swedish, and be able to support themselves.
During their day in Almedalen, the Liberal Party also put forward suggestions about opening for business immigrants, and simplifying for guest students who wish to stay in Sweden to work.
Jan Björklund, Liberal Party leader and minister for education, pointed at the need for more highly qualified labour immigration. He underlined that it should be made easier for researchers and engineers, among others, to come to Sweden.
"Economic development is no longer tied to machinery, and the countries who succeed in attracting very qualified and competent people will perform much better," said Björklund to news agency TT.
The Liberal Party also calls for people with experience of running companies, who also have a starting capital, being permitted to move to Sweden and start a business.
Björklund will be pursuing these questions in the government, in the hope to turn them into real politics.
"This is in line with the view on employment and labour immigration that the government has held previously. It's just taking it a few extra steps."
Pernilla Gunther, the Christian Democrats' intergration spokeswoman, was surprised by the Liberal Party's suggestions.
The Christian Democrats tried to pass their own version of two of these suggestions in the negotiations over the Alliance's manifesto, before the election last year.
"It was in the negotiations, but didn't pass," said Gunther to TT.
According to a recent report, the eight richest individuals in the world have as much combined wealth as the poorest 50 percent. In other words, at a small inconvenience to eight inordinately rich men, the living standard of half of the world's people could be doubled.
In fact, new research by economist Thomas Piketty shows that over the last 30 years there has been zero growth in the income of the bottom 50 percent while income of the top 1 percent has tripled. During the same period, the price of tuition, room and board at an average public four-year college, according to the Collegeboard, increased from $8,160 to $20,090, adjusted for inflation.
Average public college students and their families have found it almost exactly five times as hard, financially, to go to school as they did 30 years ago. If nothing is done about this inequality, which seems to be the case based on President-elect Donald Trump's platforms and proposed tax policy, our siblings and even our children will be dealing with the same issues, which are likely to get even worse.
That's why during these troubling times, liberal states need to take charge and serve as a counterbalance to Trump. California in particular needs to maintain and even extend financial support for students to pursue higher education – the “great equalizer.”
Under Trump's plans, this dire inequality may grow much worse. For instance, he wants to abolish the estate tax, which will remove taxes on $2.1 trillion worth of inheritances over the next 20 years – a sum larger than the gross domestic product of India, a country of 1.3 billion people. Without taxing this income, a small number of heirs will become inordinately rich through no work of their own, further widening the gap between rich and poor and undermining the meritocracy this country stands for.
Furthermore, Trump's plan for tax cuts consists of reducing the top marginal rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent, eliminating the tax on investment income of high-income households and reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from its current 35 percent. This in a world where, according to Oxfam, the 10 largest corporations had as much revenue last year as the 180 poorest countries.
Overall, the tax code under Trump's plan will be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1 percent of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99 percent of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500. To be clear, the bottom 99 percent of earners will include nearly every single UCLA student once they enter their first job.
According to the Tax Policy Center, Trump's proposals would reduce federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over its first decade. Unless they are accompanied by very large spending cuts, they could increase the national debt by nearly 80 percent of the gross domestic product by 2036. In terms of its macroeconomic ramifications, Moody's Analytics ran the numbers and concluded that, if taken at face value, the result would be an unusually lengthy recession—even longer than the Great Recession.
Trump) has proposed large tax cuts, but very little in the way of spending cuts. This means that the federal debt will grow, and today's college students … may be facing significantly higher tax rates during their prime earning years.”
Even if Trump does manage to cut spending the necessary amount to offset the loss in tax revenue, this will leave the country in even greater inequality. Those hit the hardest by those unlikely spending cuts will be poor people who rely on government programs to survive. Ultimately, with Trump, it's a lose-lose for students and recent grads. Either he cuts spending along with taxes and inequality gets much worse, or he doesn't and inequality still gets worse and students and recent graduates will have to pay very high taxes to offset the massive debt that will result.
With Trump at the helm, it is ultimately up to the citizens of liberal states like California to push for measures that counterbalance the mistakes he will make during his time in office and implore the state to support its most vulnerable residents.
One immediate way for the state to demonstrate its support for less affluent students would be to preserve the scholarship for middle income students that Gov. Jerry Brown is currently considering cutting. According to the New York Times, UCLA enrolls the most low and middle-income students of any elite university. This means that out of all the top schools in the nation, UCLA is the place for the low and middle classes to make their voices heard. The student body must make it clear to the UC administration and California state government that this is the worst possible time for scholarships to be cut.
It is the overwhelming sentiment among students that Trump is president now, and there's nothing to do but wait and see what happens in his administration. But this is the worst time for political apathy. Now more than ever, the campus needs to mobilize to get state legislation passed that will help those that will be worst hit by the coming storm.
Some students may prefer to focus on their own well-being before that of others, but they must keep in mind that as they enter the workforce, they will be part of that subsection of the population adversely affected by President Trump.
Students have nothing to lose but their student debt and grim-looking future.

See: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv-5.4/docs/Data-SBV.html#g:39 A slightly larger example checks for lack-of-division-by-0 in a simple program: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv-5.4/docs/Data-SBV-Examples-Misc-NoDiv0.html Further documentation on SBV is available at: http://leventerkok.github.io/sbv/ Calls to sAssert calls are also preserved in the SBV->C compilation path. This feature is rather experimental and , and I'd love to hear if you give it a try and see any gotchas.. Happy proving. -Levent. PS. Thanks to Brett Letner for suggesting this functionality. -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

It's time for Bernie Sanders to admit that Hillary Clinton is winning the primary fair and square, and if he can't do that, it's time for him to quit.
Things have been getting sour for Team Sanders for weeks now, but, in the past week, the campaign took a decisive turn away from positive campaigning and actually trying to win towards focusing a baffling amount of energy on a futile narrative about how his losses don't really count.

I wish it were otherwise, but there's simply no nice way to put this. The Sanders camp has decided to focus on stoking half-baked complaints about process, complaints that don't serve to win a single vote to their side. Instead, it seems about Sanders and his supporters insinuating that Clinton is winning by cheating. The behavior is not the behavior of people trying to win. It's the behavior of someone who lost a hand of poker and is throwing his cards in his opponent's face and screaming about how unfair it is that the other guy drew a better hand.
Things had already been getting ugly prior to the New York primary, with Sanders trying to dismiss the Clinton wins in the "deep South" by saying, "That is the most conservative part of this great country."
This excuse is nonsense. The reason he "got murdered" (his words) there is not because Clinton supporters are conservative. (On the contrary, some polling shows more conservative Democrats vote Sanders over Clinton.) It's because the Democratic primaries in these states have a larger percentage of black voters, who turn out in greater numbers than Clinton, and Sanders knows it.
This is what Ed Kilgore of New York magazine calls "the some-voters-are-less-equal-than-others heresy", which is "that Hillary Clinton's primary victories should be discounted because they disproportionately depended on African-American voters in states Democrats are not likely to win in November."
Unfortunately for Sanders, simply believing that these primaries count for less does not make it so. When he arrives at the convention, if it does get that far, he will find that these delegates get as much of a right to vote as any others, even though he spent months dismissing their value.
All this does is stoke resentment amongst his white supporters and hurt the feelings of black voters, and to what purpose? The pleasure of seeing screaming matches get uglier on Twitter?

Things got even more bizarre going into the New York primaries. Polling made it a foregone conclusion that Clinton was going to win, leaving the Sanders campaign with two choices: Running a positive campaign focused on reducing margins or dumping a huge amount of time and resources into trying to argue that a win in New York doesn't really count because reasons.
Guess which one they chose? If you are a Democrat living in New York who has either a computer or a desire to leave the house on occasion, you probably know the answer to this.
The Sanders campaign spent the past week kicking up dust and trying to convince their supporters that the only reason for the inevitable New York loss is they were robbed.
The twofold strategy was to imply that Clinton and the DNC are somehow involved in voter suppression because New York has a closed primary and by hollering unintelligible nonsense about Clinton's victory fund and the work George Clooney did to raise money for it.

Neither of these arguments did one single thing to improves Sanders's chances. But they did a bang-up job of sowing suspicions that Clinton is somehow corrupt when she's not. That certainly isn't going to be a problem when she's running in the general election, is it?
The closed primary argument was especially laughable, because it was so obvious that the "outrage" that was spewing out on social media was ill-informed and self-serving.
To summarize: You have to be a registered member of a party in order to vote in their primary. To many people who had, right up until last weekend, never even given this fact a moment's thought, this became a grave injustice because, it turns out, they registered as independents and not Democrats and had no chance of voting in the primary. The outrage poured out and the rhetoric about "voter suppression" abounded.

This wasn't just some social media fancy, however. Sanders was happily stoking this nonsense. ABC News ran a video of Sanders and some bearded white guy in New York chattering about how much a bummer it is that non-Democrats can't vote in the Democratic primary, with Sanders intoning dramatically about how independent voters " have lost their right to vote". Which is blooey nonsense, since political parties are private organizations that you are free to join if you want, and these voters just chose not to.
If one can step away from the Sanders dramatics for a moment, the silliness of this becomes evident. I, for instance, would love to vote in the Republican primary and hell, any other party's while I'm at it. But that is unfair and undemocratic, because the purpose of primaries is for the members of that party to select the person they most want to run, a purpose that is thwarted when outsiders are allowed to come in and manipulate the system. If you want a voting stake in organization, be it the local food co-op or the Democratic Party, you should have to join first.
A similar thing is going on with the strum und drang over Clinton's victory fund. Victory funds are these dual-fundraising efforts where presidential candidates fundraise and whatever money they get that goes over their donor limits goes to the party or down-ticket candidates. So, if you want to write a $5,000 check to Clinton, she keeps what the law will allow and the rest goes to the party or other candidates.

The Sanders campaign sent out a letter that, while carefully avoiding any accusations of illegal behavior (of which they know there isn't any), suggested there was some kind of dirty tricks because the presidential campaign takes a bigger share of the fundraising than the party or down-ticket candidates. This was, as anyone sorry enough to venture online yesterday found out, was treated by Sanders supporters like some great discovery and certain proof that Clinton is a cheating cheater.
It's also all smoke and mirrors. For one thing, Sanders himself has a victory fund. He just hasn't bothered to fundraise for it, preferring to focus his energies on efforts where he gets to keep all of the money, instead of giving some away like Clinton does. How that makes him more selfless and noble, I have no idea.
Second of all, the whole purpose of throwing this dust up is to imply that Clinton is somehow buying this election. But the sorry truth is that Sanders outspent Clinton by a lot in New York, spending almost twice as much on TV ads. If elections can be bought so easily, Sanders should have had a blowout performance in New York, but he lost, by wide margins.
Invariably, when these points are brought up, Sanders supporters retreat to high-and-mighty justifications about greater transparency or the problems of too much money in politics. Which sounds good, but the fact that none of these concerns are mentioned in the same breath as the Republicans, who are the reason for campaign finance deregulation, gives the game away.

This isn't about high-minded values. It's not even really about winning the Democratic primary. It's about creating a narrative where Sanders and his supporters can feel like they would have won, except for the dirty cheaters who cheated them.
It's human nature to retreat to this kind of self-serving nonsense in the face of defeat, to be fair. And it wouldn't really be a big deal if Sanders would pack up his cards and go home to stew about how supposedly unfair it is that they let Southerners vote but don't let non-Democrats elect the party's nominee. Instead, these half-baked complaints are being poured out in public and feeding pointless rage and conspiracy theory thinking.
None of which will help the Sanders campaign win. On the contrary, this sort of behavior is bound to piss off the superdelegates Sanders wants, but who probably don't like hearing how their party is supposedly corrupt. All this does is undermine the Clinton campaign by spreading misinformation.
The Sanders campaign did a lot of good for a long time, pushing Clinton to the left and drawing attention away from the Republican campaign. But now all he's doing is sowing pointless animosity. If he can't get back to productive work, it's time for him to retire this campaign.
YouTube is by far the world's most popular online video web site. But in some ways Hulu is stealing the show.
With critical plaudits and advertising dollars flowing to Hulu, the popular online hub for television shows and feature films, YouTube finds itself in the unanticipated position of playing catch-up.
On Monday, YouTube will move forward a little, announcing an agreement to show some full-length television shows and films from MGM, the financially troubled 84-year-old film studio.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios will kick off the partnership by posting episodes of its decade-old “American Gladiators” program to YouTube, along with full-length action films like “Bulletproof Monk” and “The Magnificent Seven” and clips from popular movies like “Legally Blonde.” These will be free to watch, with ads running alongside the video.
The initial lineup may not be all that compelling, but for YouTube, which is owned by Google, the relationship with MGM is a crucial step in an essential reinvention. YouTube had its debut in 2005 and quickly became famous for the democratic sharing of bite-size video clips. Users love the site — 81 million people visited in September alone, according to Nielsen.
YouTube is trying harder to make friends with Hollywood — and emulate the appeal of Hulu, a joint venture of NBC and Fox. Along with its MGM relationship, YouTube has recently forged ties with the independent studio Lionsgate and with CBS, which this month started posting to YouTube full-length episodes of older shows like “Star Trek” and “Beverly Hills 90210.”

Weekly digest, heh) I fixed the issue with fleet creation and finally managed to launch campaign. Unfortunately that wasn't enough. Though the game is relatively playable, there are severe economic issues. I can't find almost any supplies. All markets have somewhat 50 supplies in black market, but none are available through open. Food is poorly distributed, resulting in frequent shortages, and it can cost 400 on producing planet with a stockpile of several thousand units. But the main is still the lack of supplies: the game is a huge pain currently. I added plenty of supply-producing market conditions like autofacs and shipbreaking centers, but that doesn't work. Any ideas?

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte gestures while speaking during a late night news conference at the presidential palace in Manila, Philippines January 30, 2017. Ezra Acayan, Reuters
MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday said he is also barring the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) from being involved in anti-illegal drug operations.
In a speech in Davao City, Duterte said the NBI is now barred from carrying out anti-drug operations, adding the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in the meantime will lead government efforts to combat drugs.
“As of now, there are no policemen in the entire country [enforcing drug laws], and I want to add even the NBI. The bureau is suspended from enforcing drug laws. Kasali kayo,” Duterte said.
“Kasi nawalaan na ako ng tiwala sa iyo,” he said.
Duterte recently ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) anti-illegal drugs unit to halt its operations in wake of the killing of a Korean national at the hands of rogue cops.
The kidnap-slay of Korean Jee Ick-joo has put the PNP on the spotlight after it was discovered that police officials killed the victim inside the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame.
Several NBI agents have also been implicated in the killing of Jee.
An alleged NBI volunteer, Jerry Omlang, recently surfaced to confess his participation in the kidnap-slay.
NBI Director Dante Gierran denied the agency's links with Omlang, saying no NBI agent was involved and Omlang was only an unpaid volunteer.
“Kung merong NBI agents na involved, papatayin ko sila. Walang NBI agents involved sa kaso,” Gierran said.
The scandal gripping the PNP has prompted Duterte to order a massive cleansing of the police force, even calling on the military to go after rogue cops.
Critics, however, say Duterte's move is a belated recognition of the flaws of the police's illegal drugs crackdown, considering that about 7,000 people have been killed by the police in illegal drugs operation and suspected vigilantes.
Vice President Biden, issuing the Obama administration's most definitive statement to date on the turmoil in Egypt, said President Hosni Mubarak should not step down and downplayed the protests spreading across the Mideast as generally unconnected.
He described the unrest as an expression of "middle-class folks" looking for "a little more access and a little more opportunity."
Though the administration says it's not taking sides, Biden said in an interview aired Thursday that Mubarak has been a U.S. "ally" on "a number of things," praising him for being "very responsible" in normalizing Egypt's relationship with Israel and aiding in Middle East peace talks.
"I would not refer to him as a dictator," Biden said on PBS' NewsHour.
Protesters challenging Mubarak's 30-year rule clashed on the streets in Cairo with police on Friday. Suggesting Mubarak's regime would weather the storm, Biden nudged the longtime Egyptian president to respond to the protests, peacefully, by being "more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there."
"I hope Mubarak ... is going to respond to some of the legitimate concerns that are being raised," he said.
The protests in Egypt followed an uprising in Tunisia and coincide with similar unrest in Yemen and Jordan, as well as the formation of a new and contested government in Lebanon.
Asked whether the wave of protests resembles in any way the public revolts that surged across Eastern Europe before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Biden said: "I wouldn't compare the two."
He went on to downplay the connection among the protests across the Middle East.
"A lot of these nations are very dissimilar. They're similar in the sense that they're Arab nations, dissimilar in the circumstance," he said. "I don't see any direct relationship, other than there seems -- it might be argued that what is happening in one country sparks whatever concern there is in another country. It may not be the same concern. It may not be even similar, but the idea of speaking out in societies where, in the recent past, there hadn't been much of that occurring. ... I could be proven wrong. But I think it's a stretch to compare it to Eastern Europe."
He urged restraint on both sides in Egypt.
"We're encouraging the protesters to, as they assemble, do it peacefully. And we're encouraging the government to act responsibly and to try to engage in a discussion as to what the legitimate claims being made are, if they are, and try to work them out," he said.
President Obama earlier addressed the Egyptian unrest for the first time in an interview broadcast on YouTube. Like Biden, he said Egypt has "been an ally of ours on a lot of critical issues."
"President Mubarak has been very helpful on a range of tough issues in the Middle East. But I've always said to him that making sure that they're moving forward on reform -- political reform, economic reform -- is absolutely critical to the long-term well-being of Egypt," he said. "And you can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets. My main hope right now is that violence is not the answer in solving these problems in Egypt, so the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence, and the people on the streets have to be careful about not resorting to violence."
It's been dismissed as costly and difficult to administer. But new research suggests that there's widespread and growing support for licensing cyclists in Toronto. A poll of 834 Toronto residents by Forum Research also shows that more than half of respondents believe that licensing bikes would be a fair trade-off for Toronto investing in European-style bike infrastructure.
Overall, 65 per cent of respondents approved of licensing bikes to improve traffic law enforcement. The broadest support — 71 per cent — came from Scarborough residents. But even among poll respondents in downtown and East York, 67 per cent agreed with licensing cyclists. Among supporters of Mayor Rob Ford, 72 per cent approved. Support for licensing has been increasing, according to Forum research. In March 2011, only 56 per cent of 1,012 residents agreed with the idea of bike licences.

More than half of respondents to this latest poll — 54 per cent — also agreed that the city should invest in “a comprehensive European-style bicycle infrastructure, with dedicated lanes and parking lots.” Downtown and East York respondents showed the highest support, at 62 per cent. Even among drivers, 48 per cent agreed with the infrastructure investment. Transit users and cyclist/pedestrians were 61 per cent and 63 per cent agreed, respectively. The Interactive Voice Response poll, conducted Friday and Saturday, found 52 per cent agreed that the licensing would be a fair trade-off for the city investing in European-style bike infrastructure such as separated lanes and secure bike parking at stations. Among motorists, 53 per cent agreed and 47 per cent of Ford supporters also said they agreed. European-style bike facilities have a good image in terms of safety, suggested Forum Research president Lorne Bozinoff.
“There have been some high-profile cycling accidents, and I think that's just raised the issue. The car-cyclist interaction has not gone that well in Toronto,” he said. Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair has said that licensing cyclists would create better accountability and contribute to better enforcement of traffic laws.

Cyclists using public roads are subject to most of the same charges and fines as a motorist under the Highway Traffic Act. Bike advocates fear that licensing would be costly to taxpayers in terms of administration and also discourage people from pedalling. The poll is considered accurate plus or minus 3 per cent, 19 times out of 20.
Anyone immersed in robotic technologies will tell you that contrary to popular belief, robots in production environments are about as unintelligent as they get – unless you take the time to add some smarts into the equation.
People don't understand that a typical robot is designed to do the exact same thing over and over, explains Michael McCourt, president of Stratford, ON-based D&D Automation Inc. “Give it a slightly different part or orientation and it can't handle that.”
That basic repetitive functionality — like pumping out millions of circuit boards or bottle — might be enough when used in a high-speed, high-volume environment where one task is all that's needed. When variability comes into play — such as welding several bolts onto a car fender — the option would be put more people on the task or invest in multiple robots.
It can look at what part is in front of it and its orientation, pick it out and perform the function required
New signs of intelligence for production drones are coming to the forefront with technologies that help robots think and react to production changes on the fly. D&D for one has just launched VERA™ (Vision Enabled Robotic Assembly), an adaptive technology that combines vision systems and programming that is currently being used in automotive welding and assembly tasks.
“It can look at what part is in front of it and its orientation, pick it out and perform the function required,” Mr. McCourt explains. “Historically plants would have to have dedicated machines for each function, and the runs would never cross.”
Not only can operations save considerably by making production changes quickly without having to pay for retooling costs, adaptive robotics can also improve quality, accuracy and worker safety. In some cases, jobs that were offshored could even be repatriated because adaptive robotics make things more affordable, Mr. McCourt contends.
It's the integration of complementary technologies that makes the difference, DiBattista notes. “That's really the key. Whether it's welding or food handling, it's the tooling and development of that system that makes it adaptive.”
While adaptive technologies may not fit ultra-high-speed applications where error-free repetition is paramount; the value for short-run, mid-market production environments and other applications in time is significant. For a welding operation, for example, a single VERA system could ultimately do a job that would take up to 20 different machines, Mr. McCourt claims.
“The real estate part of adaptive robotics is huge,” DiBattista says. “A vision system talking to a controller in a [nut welding cell] for example will know how to pick the right nut for the right part. You could reduce your footprint for that cell considerably.”
“It's a game changer,” Mr. McCourt notes. “When humans are doing these types of tasks, it's only a matter of time before they put three fasteners on instead of four. Robots never get tired.”
The timing couldn't be better as operations are becoming increasingly focused on the concept of flexible manufacturing. As Emil Petriu, professor and university research chair at the University of Ottawa's School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science explains, “In highly structured environments, robots became very precise. They had high tolerances and produced fantastic products … as long as nothing changed in volume production. Now flexibility is being requested at the machine level, especially in small-batch or one-of-a-kind production.”
He considers systems that can adjust to the level of automation on the fly an entirely new class of robot. “But in order to do this, you need to leverage some intrinsic intelligence and complex sensing/perception. Systems have to cope with interaction, failures, workload changes and critical mission requirements.”
The caveat to date has been that smaller production environments simply can't afford to have humans micro-managing each robot throughout the day when production demands change. With rich sensory and perception capabilities, however, a robot can understand more complex conditions and adapt without that type of human intervention.
When humans are doing these types of tasks, it's only a matter of time before they put three fasteners on instead of four; robots never get tired
The viability of this adaptability has been aided by several advancements from disparate quarters: vision systems (cameras), microprocessors and improved programming capabilities. “Vision systems capabilities have increased while becoming more affordable. They're now pretty much plug and play,” says Casey DiBattista, general manager for ABB Robotics in Brampton. “With open architecture you can get to lower code levels, whereas robot companies used to spend a lot of time programming.”
The availability of adaptive robotics in manufacturing can be attributed to industries that had the need and the deep pockets to advance technology throughout its early R&D stages. “The work done by the military and space programs in sensing, intelligence and dexterity is now filtering down to manufacturing,” Mr. Petriu says. As far as affordable, high-performing vision systems go, he says the entertainment industry can be thanked for that.
Add to that the advancements in microprocessor technologies and all the elements needed to build adaptive robots are ready and waiting to be applied on a more practical level. “Microprocessors are everywhere, even under my cat's skin. All of these technologies are ready to be used in manufacturing.”
Mr. DiBattista says as it stands today, the most significant uptake in adaptive robots will be in mid-range companies as a means to reduce capital costs, increase quality, reduce breakages and improve yields. “They will get payback very quickly through faster, more efficient production.”
Beyond that Mr. Petriu envisions a world where they could be used to operate in high-risk environments, or even assisting seniors in their homes. “What do you do when you don't have the mechanical ability to manage your house? Adaptive robots could be programmed to assist them and put things together. It makes a lot of economic sense.”

Ligue 1 clubs made more money from transfers than the other major leagues in Europe.
Southampton has the most profitable youth academy among the top leagues in Europe, according to a study by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES).
CIES studied which clubs in the top flights in England, Spain, France, Germany and Italy generated the most money from transfers from players from their academies and discovered Southampton topped the list at €90.2m since 2012.
Almost 40 percent of the Premier League's total came from Southampton's summer sale of three England internationals: Adam Lallana to Liverpool (€30m), Luke Shaw to Manchester United (€35m) and Calum Chambers (€20m) to Arsenal.
Lille were second on the list at €76m thanks to players including Eden Hazard (€37m to Chelsea) and Mathieu Debuchy (€16m to Arsenal), while Real Sociedad's sales of Antoine Griezmann (€30m to Atletico Madrid) and Asier Illarramendi (€32.2m to Real Madrid) put them third with €62.2m.
At €43m, Real Madrid -- Jose María Callejon, Daniel Carvajal, Esteban Granero, Alvaro Morata -- pipped rivals Barcelona (€38.8m euros) -- Thiago Alcantara, Jonathan dos Santos, Andreu Fontas, Bojan Krkic, Antonio Sanabria -- for sixth.
The next Premier League club on the list was Swansea City at No. 11 (€31.6m) after the sales of Joe Allen and Ben Davies followed by Manchester United at No. 13 (€28.7m) after they let a host of young players go: Michael Keane, Robert Brady, Matt James, Joshua King and Danny Welbeck (€20m to Arsenal.)
Other European powerhouses include 12th placed Bayern Munich (€31.1m) who made some money back from the sales of Emre Can, Diego Contento, Raif Husic and Toni Kroos; Paris Saint-German recouped €25.2m from Clement Chantome, Antoine Conte, Mamadou Sakho, Ilan Boccara and finished 14th in the table.
With Rennes (€33.6m), Montpellier (€33.5m) and St Etienne (€32.8m) in eighth, ninth and 10th places, Ligue 1 clubs generated the most transfer fees of the five leagues at €292 million, slightly ahead of La Liga with €276 million, and the Premier League at €227 million.
But look how much smaller the bill is.

The House Republican plan to replace Obamacare would leave 24 million additional Americans without health insurance by 2026 and cut $880 billion from Medicaid over a decade, according to a new, widely anticipated estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
As a point of comparison, the Affordable Care Act extended insurance to an estimated 20 million Americans.
The Republican health care plan would cut spending on subsidies to help Americans purchase health insurance while rolling back the ACA's Medicaid expansion and capping per-person spending on the program, which insures lower-income Americans, going forward. It would also eliminate the requirement that Americans buy insurance or pay a tax penalty, as well as rules requiring employers to offer insurance to their workers.
The CBO expects that the law's combined effects would cause millions to lose coverage immediately, with losses growing over time. By 2018, 14 million fewer Americans would have health insurance—about 6 million fewer would purchase insurance on the individual market, while 5 million fewer would benefit from Medicaid. By 2026, Medicaid's projected enrollment would be 14 million lower than under current law.
The longer-term effects on the individual market are slightly more complicated. By 2020, 9 million fewer people would buy insurance on their own, compared with under Obamacare. By 2026, the losses would be down to 2 million, as “people would gain experience with the new structure of the tax credits and some employers would respond to those tax credits by declining to offer insurance to their employees.”
That's what passes for good news on the coverage front.
The CBO is slightly more sanguine about the legislation's effects on the federal budget. It would still shrink the 10-year deficit by $337 billion.* That's largely because it slashes that $880 billion from Medicaid, while shrinking spending on insurance subsidies by around $300 billion. That makes it possible for Republicans to pack in more than $590 billion in tax cuts, largely directed at the wealthy and health insurers, without swelling the national debt. So, you know, Trumpcare's got that going for it.
*Correction, March 13, 2017, at 5:30 p.m.: This post originally misstated that the CBO believes the Republican health care plan would shrink the 10-year deficit by $337. The estimate is $337 billion.
Arthur Ganson is a mechanical engineer by trade and a kinetic sculptor at heart. His mechanized devices spur up spirit from cogs and wires, as his sculptures move with subtlety and grace, often in a chain reaction of energy à la Rube Goldberg. His creations are rooted inside deep philosophical concepts, but at the same time shine with an unparalleled dash of humor – a small reminder not to take life too serious.
Arthur Ganson's art is by all means impressive, and there is no way of understanding this other than taking a remote glimpse upon these kinetic contraptions for yourself. Outlined below you'll find some of these amazing sculptures, some decades old, alongside a brief interview with the former artist in residence at MIT himself, who was kind enough to answer some of my questions.
Machine with 23 Scraps of Paper
ZME Science: The first sense I got while watching one of your sculptures was amazement. It's quite ordinary for such a natural emotion to surface whenever you're granted to see an animated wishbone seemingly tract its own mechanical life force. Soon after though, one begins to notice other things too. You get fascinated, seduced by it – it all feels like poetry. I can only wonder then what stream of emotions go past you, as the creator, as you go through various stages of completion before finally seeing it in motion. What's it like?
Arthur Ganson: There are many different feelings that go through me in the process of making a piece. In the beginning, before the physical process of building the piece begins there is much light-hearted dreaming and often moments where I feel a deep inspiration. This time can be very fluid because the ‘form' of the piece can change dramatically. It is not material yet! The building process itself has many aspects and depending on the particular piece, some things are more predominant. As a rule, no matter how much imagining I do, the piece must be built in order for me to know how well it will ‘speak'. In this regard I often feel much anticipation, especially if there is much building that must happen to se anything. Sometimes a piece will not work in the end. This can be a disappointment if I am not able to re-work the idea. The process is often filled with much determination and excitement throughout. Depending on the piece, there can be sublime moments of building or tedious moments of building…. or eureka moments or surprises……
Machine with Wishbone
ZME Science: The intricate mechanisms that you employ in your art can be viewed by many as complex, however some I've seen, as I did my research, believe there are many redundant parts to it. How do you believe the Rube Goldberg machine-esque approach to your mechanisms aids in amplifying the sentiment surrounding the sculpture?
Arthur Ganson: There are no un-necessary parts to the machines. Every part is there for a reason. I loved looking at Rube Goldberg drawings when I was a kid, and now his name is synonymous with absurdly complicated systems that do something very simple. I guess in one sense that's partly true with some of my machines, but the impulse for me is not to be needlessly complex for the fun of it. When I started I was making things way more complex than necessary, but now I think I'm getting more simple and bringing things down to the essence. If they come across as rube goldbergesque is more because the observer doesn't understand the machine. All aspects of the way something is built and exists in space will effect the nature of how it speaks emotionally. All decisions speak to the state of being of the creator.
Faster!
ZME Science: Much of your art seems to come to life, as various gears or wires twitch and turn in a chain of events that describe a sublime motion. This all seems so very precise, so intricate – I can only imagine the amount of time and patience you must dedicate. How do you come about building it piece by piece, aligning each part together with utmost accuracy? Do you start from somewhere and then just improvise along the way or do you work at a plan before starting, like computing, sketching and such?
Arthur Ganson: I usually start the work in my mind and then move to very general sketches that help me to visualize the overall proportions and mechanical systems and relationships. I rarely work by just starting somewhere and seeing where I end up- it's not in my nature and usually the piece necessitates a good degree of thought in order to solve the real mechanical issues. However, nothing is a rule! Some of the fragile machines are pretty free in their evolution. Working with wire does not require a high degree of accuracy. Actually, it's the place where I can be the most relaxed. The fragile wire pieces are the closest to oil painting that I can come. Here, I'll create a staring point and have only a general sense of how the machine will fill space. If there is no particular mechanical problem to solve and the piece just has to move, that's very open-ended.
Cory's Yellow Chair
ZME Science: On the same subject, how does the process behind your art creation looks like? I've noticed that you've went to the extent of making your own tools for the custom work and that many of your parts are from various abandon mechanical objects. What's your take on the objects you later use as components?
Arthur Ganson: There is much invention in the process and often it has to do with jigs and tools to make the piece. Currently I'm working on a new version of Cory's Yellow Chair and I'm working on all kinds of jigs that will allow me to make gears with more conventional teeth- because this piece requires this in order to move properly. This is a situation in which the wire gears won't translate power properly and the essence of the piece is it's movement. I'm able to incorporate found objects sometimes, but I don't have any particular take on it. Sometimes the piece is built around a found object, but I generally don't work in a way where I'm collected a bunch of things and then try to assemble the mass into something.

Lawmakers in Minnesota and New York have introduced legislation to prohibit the use of controversial gay-to-straight conversion therapy on LGBT youth.
In New York, bills were jointly introduced in both houses of the legislature by State Assemblymember Deborah Glick (D-Manhattan) and State Sens. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan) and Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), to ban the practice, also referred to as reparative therapy.
“Banning this so-called ‘therapy' is a bipartisan issue,” said Holyman. “It's time for New York to protect our kids from this insidious practice, which has been thoroughly discredited by experts and poses a serious threat to the health and well-being of LGBT youth.”
“Trying to change someone's true identity through so-called therapy is a dangerous practice that can seriously harm our LGBT youth,” said Nathan M. Schaefer, Executive Director of Empire State Pride Agenda, in a statement.
“Anyone who says they can change an LGBT person from being who they are is preying off of fear and confusion to sell a practice that doesn't work and causes lasting harm,” said Schaefer.
In Minnesota, Rep. Susan Allen (DFL-Minneapolis) has also introduced that would ban the practice on LGBT youth in her state.
Allen said conversion therapy practitioners aren't as overt as they once were but that the treatment is still widespread.
“If you look at over the period of the last five years, they've sort of changed the way they advertise their services,” Allen told Capitol Report. “It's not as obvious anymore that some of the Christian, sort of, based mental health services that offer this type of therapy. It's just sort of given that it's part of their family therapy. So it is prevalent, and it is a nationwide problem.”

Nationally, the fight against reparative therapy has been met with push back from faith activists who say the bill limits freedom of religion and speech.
Both California and New Jersey have banned the treatment but legal challenges followed shortly after the bills were signed into law.
California's ban was upheld at the federal level, and by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Another federal judge ruled made a similar ruling in November upholding the New Jersey law.
Similar legislation has also been introduced recently in Maryland and Virginia.
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania lawmakers introduced similar bills last year.

Continuing the kind of innovative work that few fast-food chains have the gall to attempt these days, KFC Korea has abandoned all rational ideas about nutrition and dared to dream with this thing, the Zinger Double Down King. It's got chicken, beef, and pork that have been fried, grilled, and griddled, respectively. What's more is that it's still bunless, of course, like its forebear, and there's some kind of special sauce involved. It's on sale now, allegedly only has 750 calories, and from the looks of some of the photos that have been circulating online, we can safely say it's in the running for the most unwieldy and completely monstrous fast-food item of all time.
In a rare variation of one of the greatest of fast-food traditions, these customers' photos of the actual Zinger Double Down look a lot crazier than its actual menu board photo.

HOUSTON -- Bob Ford, the longtime, golden-piped public address announcer for the Houston Astros, realized that 2015 was for real after his team overcame a three-run deficit to beat the reigning American League champion Kansas City Royals 6-5 on July 1. It wasn't so much the victory, or the three-game sweep, as it was the reaction of Royals broadcaster Steve Stewart, whom he ran into on his way out of Minute Maid Park.
As Ford recalls, "Steve said to me, 'We can't wait to get outta here.'"
There have been other such whistles from this locomotive that nobody saw coming -- the mystery train that arrived way ahead of schedule. After all, the Astros lost 416 games in the four seasons before this one. At the end of the 2014 season, general manager Jeff Luhnow hired a new manager in A.J. Hinch, then made some canny, under-the radar acquisitions in the offseason -- trading for lumbering Evan Gattis and free-swinging Luis Valbuena, and signing reliever Luke Gregerson and infielder Jed Lowrie. But when Luhnow predicted in January that the team would finish .500 or better, he was openly mocked. The Astros' payroll was 29th out of the 30 teams in Major League Baseball, their attendance was 26th, and question marks far outnumbered exclamation points.
In fact, if Ford were to announce the prevailing opinions about the Opening Day lineup at Minute Maid, it would have reverberated as too short, too raw, too big, too iffy, too toxic, too fragile, too low-A batting average ... you get the idea.
But here they are -- too good to be true -- about to wipe their feet on the welcome mat of Yankee Stadium in the American League wild-card game against the most storied franchise in baseball, not to mention the second highest payroll. Go ahead, laugh at the Astros' hitters, who are 21st in the majors in batting average, 16th in on-base percentage and second (the bad way) in strikeouts. With the possible exception of Cy Young Award candidate Dallas Keuchel (20-8, 2.48 ERA), none of their players will figure in the AL MVP voting.

But look beyond the traditional numbers, and you will find a team that's third in the majors in run differential (+111), second in the American League only to the Toronto Blue Jays. By the arcane BaseRuns statistics, which measure how many runs a team should have scored, the Astros should have 11 more wins than the 86 they needed to squeak past the Los Angeles Angels as the league's second wild card.
And while respect is not a statistic, the Astros are clearly last in that category among the postseason teams. Even in football-mad Houston, they are a well-kept secret, which is too bad because people are missing a helluva party. The 10-game winning streak that propelled them to a seven-game lead in the AL West on May 3. The 15 last at-bat wins. The August sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers, when newly acquired Mike Fiers threw a no-hitter that upstaged Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw. The heroics of Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa, the most distinctive double play combination since Mutt and Jeff.
Then there are the fashion statements. At the gift shop, fans can buy a T-shirt that reads, "The Only Dallas I Will Root For," over a drawing of Keuchel, or a hat with a silhouette of his Amish-inspired beard. For the recent rookie hazing costume party, Correa had to dress as Wonder Woman.
Two-year transformation Comparing win totals to show the five most improved teams since 2013. TEAM 2013 2015 DIF. Houston 51 86 +35 Chicago Cubs 66 97 +31 Toronto 74 93 +19 Minnesota 66 83 +17 NY Mets 74 90 +16
The one sad note in this remarkably surprising season is that longtime broadcaster Milo Hamilton passed away before he could see them make the postseason for the first time since they were swept by the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 World Series.
"This has been a fun ride," Hinch says. "Hopefully, we can keep it going."
So what did the Astros know? Given the infamous hacking of the team's proprietary information by Luhnow's former colleagues in St. Louis, neither he nor anybody else in the organization is about to hand out their recipe. But they've skipped the part about "season to taste" because they were aiming to compete in 2017, not 2015. So they are perfectly happy to try to answer the question that goes along with "What did you know?" -- namely, "When did you know it?"
"We had reason for optimism all along," Luhnow says. "We could see that the bullpen was much better with Gregerson and Pat Neshek, that A.J. was the right man for the job. Then came all sorts of pleasant surprises. But it really hit home for me that we were a contender on my birthday, June 8. That's when we called up Carlos Correa. Not only was he ready to take over at shortstop, but it made us a better, deeper, more-confident team.
"That, to me, was the defining moment."
"But it really hit home for me that we were a contender on my birthday, June 8. That's when we called up Carlos Correa. Not only was he ready to take over at shortstop, but it made us a better, deeper, more-confident team. That, to me, was the defining moment." Astros GM Jeff Luhnow
Indeed, Correa has been all that and more. On the field, he has been dazzling defensively and offensively -- project his numbers out to a 162-game season, and he would have had 36 homers and 111 RBIs to go with his .857 OPS. In the clubhouse, where teammates sport SHOWRREA T-shirts, the 6-foot-4 No. 1 pick in the 2012 draft has thrived in the company of his 5-foot-6 lockermate Altuve. When Correa was asked on Sept. 22, his 21st birthday, if Altuve had given him a present, the rookie had the presence to say, "Playing next to him is like a birthday present every day." Four days later, they hit two homers apiece to help beat the Texas Rangers 9-7 to keep their hopes afloat.
If the Astros do have a winning formula, it's this: New school talks to old school. "People who have never swung a bat or throw a pitch can teach us something about baseball," Luhnow says. "By the same token, people who have played the game can see and sense things that go beyond analytics."
From that new school comes Sig Megdal, a former NASA scientist who fell in love with baseball and came to prominence as the sensei in Sam Walker's delightful 2006 odyssey into Rotisserie baseball, "Fantasyland." Just after the book came out, Luhnow hired Megdal to work in the Cardinals' analytics department, and when Luhnow took the job in Houston in December of 2011, he brought Megdal along with him.
So when did the man who bears the title, director of decision sciences, baseball operations, know that the Astros were primed for launch?
"I had modest expectations at the start of the year -- a .500 team would have been fine for me," Megdal says. "I don't know how interesting this is, but on the first Sunday in May, when Evan Gattis hit the go-ahead home run in the eighth to finish the sweep of the Mariners, I looked at, of all things, the standings. We were 18-7, seven games up in the AL West. None of the other teams was off to a good start. So I could see that if we played .500 ball the rest of the way, we would finish in the high 80s in wins, which might be good enough in the division. That's when I first thought, 'We are a contender.'"

Indeed, the Astros finished with 86 wins -- not enough to win the division but enough to edge out the Angels for the second wild-card spot.
With executives and advisers such as Nolan Ryan, Craig Biggio, Roger Clemens, Enos Cabell, Jose Cruz and Jimmy Wynn, the men standing behind the batting cage are sometimes more of an attraction than the men inside it. The other day, Cabell was talking about when he first thought of these Astros the way he did of the 1980 Astros he helped get into the postseason.
"Kinda snuck up on us, didn't they? I was thinking next year, not this year. But Jeff made some good deals, we go on that 10-game winning streak, Keuchel and [Colin] McHugh come into their own, the bullpen steps up. Here's where it hit home for me: The game in September [the 13th] when we were trailing the Angels 3-0 with two outs and nobody on in the top of the ninth. against their closer [Huston Street]. The kid [Preston] Tucker homers. [George] Springer triples, Altuve singles, Correa singles. Lowrie pinch-hits for Gattis, and boom, three-run homer down the right-field line. Then Gregerson closes them out 1-2-3, and we win 5-3. One of the best games I've ever seen."
Astros among the best Are the Astros the third-best team in MLB? They are in run differential. Here's the run differential for each of the 10 postseason teams. TEAM RUN DIF. Toronto Blue Jays +221 St. Louis Cardinals +122 Houston Astros +111 Pittsburgh Pirates +101 Kansas City Royals +83 Chicago Cubs +81 Los Angeles Dodgers +72 New York Mets +70 New York Yankees +66 Texas Rangers +18
If there's one Astro who represents both new school and old school, it's Hinch. He was in one of the first issues of ESPN The Magazine as a catching prospect for the A's out of Stanford, but his playing career never really took off. After retiring in 2005, he went directly into the Arizona Diamondbacks front office, and became their manager in 2009 at the ridiculously young age of 34. That, too, didn't go very well, so Hinch went back inside as an assistant GM for the San Diego Padres.
"We actually interviewed A.J. a few years ago," Luhnow says, "and while we really liked him, we could sense he was undecided on what his career path was, front office or dugout. The second time around, he knew, and we knew."
So when did Hinch know he had a contender on his hands? "I first got a sense of our resilience early on. We lose two of three at home to start the season, then win two of three in Texas. Lose three of four, then win 14 of 15. We hit another bad stretch, then win five in a row.
"That's what I love about this team, their heart. There are times when we start going bad, like right before the All-Star break, then we snap out of it. Just when you think we've run out of steam, we pick it up again."
The Astros faced one last test week when they momentarily lost their hold on the second wild-card spot, but then they won six of their final eight games as Texas eliminated the Angels from contention on Sunday.

Throughout the ups and downs, Keuchel has been the bellwether. The 27-year-old lefthander is 15-0 at home with a 1.46 ERA, and while the wild-card game is in the Bronx, Keuchel beat the Yankees there with seven shutout innings on Aug. 13. That was actually five months after the pitcher first felt he was pitching for a contender.
"I swear, I felt it in spring training. You can get a good sense of a team in Florida. You look around the first day, and you realize the tough times are over -- Hey, we're not gonna lose 100 games. There are some real players in this room, some special pieces. Then the optimism builds and builds, and it's the last week of the spring, and the guys are really excited, and you can't wait for Opening Day."
And on that day, Keuchel beat the Indians and Corey Kluber 2-0, as Gregerson got the save.
Who knows if Tuesday will be Closing Day for the Astros. If it is, then there's next year, and the stockpile of No. 1 draft choices, and the performance of their Fresno Grizzlies, who beat the Columbus Clippers 7-0 in the Triple-A championship game. But if it isn't, and the Astros can get to the next round, and back to Houston, then maybe this is the first year in their 53-year history that they will be world champions.
Wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Then again, that's exactly what the 2015 Astros did.
Family members unable to reach their grandmother in Florida after Hurricane Matthew made sure she was safe by ordering a pizza to her house.
Eric Olsen, who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, said he grew worried after being unable to reach Claire Olsen, his 87-year-old grandmother who lives alone in Palm Coast, Florida, for two days after the storm ripped through the area, according to ABC News. When he spoke to her on Friday, she told him she had lost power.
“I was calling the police department, I was calling the sheriff's department, and no one was answering, so I was really worried,” Olsen told ABC News. “So I just said, ‘I'm going to order her a pizza, and if they can deliver it, then I know she's alive.”
Olsen ordered the pizza from Papa John's and gave special instructions for the delivery person to call his phone upon getting to his grandmother's house and give the phone to Claire Olsen so he could speak to her. It worked—to his relief, Olsen heard his grandmother alive and well on the other line.

“Police and fire couldn't do it, but Papa John's got there in 30 minutes and put the cellphone to her ear,” he said. “People are asking why I didn't call the police and ask them to do a wellness check, but I did. Trust me, Papa John's was a last resort.”
Claire Olsen told ABC News affiliate WFTV the surprise pepperoni pizza was “fantastic.”
Lance Tyler, the pizza deliveryman, told WFTV that Claire Olsen's expression “was just priceless” while speaking to her grandson.

Continental Tire will exit IMSA competition at the end of 2018, including title sponsorship of the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge, with IMSA electing not to extend its long-standing partnership, the tire manufacturer announced on Wednesday.
The change comes after a nearly decade-long relationship with IMSA, which has included the exclusive tire contract for the Prototype, Prototype Challenge and GT Daytona classes of the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship since its launch in 2014.
Continental joined the sports car series in 2010, in Grand-Am, and has provided significant investment within the sport through various marketing activities.
Its five-year contract, signed pre-merger, expires at the end of 2018 and IMSA to evaluate proposals from multiple tire manufacturers to take over the exclusivity contract.
Continental says its proposal for a multi-year extension included a “significant increase” in investment.
“We are extremely proud of the contributions we've made to sports car racing in the U.S.,” said Travis Roffler, director of marketing of Continental Tire the Americas.
“We worked diligently to continue our support of IMSA, and the growth of the sport, and are disappointed in IMSA‘s decision to go a different direction. We remain committed to making the 2018 IMSA season a fantastic year for the fans, drivers, and all the teams.
“The relationships we've built over the years are many, and we thank everyone for their continued support of the Continental Tire brand. We also want to thank the fans. Without you, there would be no racing.“
It's understood Michelin, along with Goodyear and Pirelli have all entered discussions with IMSA for the 2019 contract.
The French tire giant, which already supplies teams in the GT Le Mans class, is believed to be the leading candidate, which would include title sponsorship of IMSA's SportsCar Challenge as well as being the exclusive tire provider for the entire WeatherTech Championship.
When reached by Sportscar365, a Michelin spokesperson has deferred all comments to IMSA, which has yet to issue a statement on its tire contract situation for 2019 and beyond.

(CNN) -- While others will sharply disagree, I believe John Brennan deserves a national salute for his press conference yesterday about the CIA.
At a time when we are tearing ourselves apart over one controversy after another, he provided a model of a calm, adult leader trying to put the country first.
No doubt there will be counterattacks trying to blow holes in his story. Maybe there are some. But we sorely needed someone to come forth with views that are more balanced and impartial than a tragically one-sided report released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee.
There were half a dozen aspects of the Brennan press conference that were welcome:
For starters, he placed the interrogation program into a context that too many are forgetting. As Brennan pointed out, the attacks that morning of 9/11 terrified the country and we quickly looked to the CIA to track down those responsible and ensure they never attacked us again.
We didn't want those agents -- as the phrase goes -- to bring a baguette to a knife fight; both the White House and Congress wanted them to do whatever it took.
Brennan also made clear that the CIA (he served as deputy director under President George W. Bush) was not prepared to run a detention and interrogation program -- who would have thought they needed one?
They put it together quickly, but -- as Brennan readily conceded -- some agents then went far beyond the rules, employing brutal interrogation techniques. He should also have conceded that was torture.
What has been missing in much of the hyperventilation over the Senate report is that the number of people water boarded was actually tiny: three says Brennan, though the Senate Committee insists the number is slightly higher.
With numbers that small, it is far more believable that most agents -- as Brennan said -- acted within the rules. Is this any basis for treating the CIA like a brutal, rogue operation?
In law school, one of the first lessons learned is how important distinctions are. Brennan made a crucial one: the difference between causation and correlation. The agency, he says, gained valuable intelligence -- such as leads on bin Laden -- from prisoners who had undergone enhanced interrogation techniques ("EITs" in the trade).
BUT it is unclear whether they might have given that same information had they not been treated to EITs. The latter, he kept insisting, is "unknowable." In other words, he does not think that harsh techniques necessarily caused detainees to open up.
Yet it is also clear from his version of events that interrogators saw a correlation: Valuable leads could often come after harsh techniques. This correlation makes it easier to understand why Bush officials would want to continue the EITs, and why so many CIA directors and deputy directors defend the program. This is a distinction that is thus very, very important.
To be fair, Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein insists that much of the information given up by detainees was obtained before they were subjected to EITs. This disagreement between her and Brennan is one of several that need further scrutiny.
But Brennan's version of events lends credence to the notion that neither the agency nor the Bush administration was acting as criminally as their critics charge.
On one side, we now have a stinging indictment of the CIA drawn up by committee staff members all hired by Democrats. Only Democratic members of the Committee approved their report. Their report was drawn up based upon millions of documents, but not a single interview with CIA agents.
On the other side, we have a well-laid out defense coming from John Brennan, who worked in the White House under Bill Clinton and was so trusted by another Democrat, Barack Obama, that he was appointed to run one of the most sensitive organizations in government, the CIA. This same man admits that the CIA made many mistakes, that the interrogation program was deeply flawed, and that it was properly stopped -- but he insists that overall, CIA agents deserve respect for bravely putting their lives on the line for the country -- some 20 have died -- and very importantly, for helping to prevent a new 9/11.
Given this background, isn't John Brennan at least as credible as the Committee, if not more so? Aren't his views more balanced -- and thus deserving of respect? Shouldn't his views help us to moderate the red hot coverage in the press and the monotonous partisan attacks among politicians? I think so.
One more thing: Brennan asked us to keep things in perspective. We need to do that -- to remember what makes us Americans. No other country to my knowledge has been so transparent about its paramilitary techniques in the midst of a dangerous war. Indeed, we all know what the terrorists would have done had they captured a bunch of Americans: They would have butchered every last one.
Good for John Brennan, he's helping us think clearly again.

After five years, some vigorous opposition, and a few contentious meetings, the traffic cameras in Oak Ridge will be removed. The Oak Ridge City Council did not extend the five-year contract with the camera vendor, Redflex Traffic Systems, on Monday.
The vote to extend the contract for two years with a few changes was 3-4.
Oak Ridge Mayor Tom Beehan, Mayor Pro Tem Jane Miller, and Council member Charlie Hensley voted in favor of the extension. Council members Trina Baughn, Anne Garcia Garland, Chuck Hope, and David Mosby voted “no.” The current contract expires April 21.
Among the proposed changes, if an extension had been granted, were mobile units, different camera locations, and a new revenue split between the city and Redflex.
The Monday night vote was made after a heated discussion from the Council and input from seven members of the community.
“It was never about safety,” Garland said. She asserted that the city had implemented the cameras in an effort to make money from traffic violations.
Some members of the community, however, felt that the cameras did make the city safer.
“I come to you with an emotional plea to keep the cameras in place,” said Miriam Wildgrouper, a legally blind resident who stated that she was recently hit by a car. She said that although the driver who hit her ran a stop sign, she believed that the red light cameras help to keep pedestrians safe from drivers who run red lights.
Beehan noted that Knoxville and Farragut have cameras such as those on Oak Ridge Turnpike, saying that city leaders in those areas don't see any issues with the programs.
Oak Ridge resident Joseph Lee was also in favor of keeping the cameras. He felt that the only reason the city was divided on the issue was “because people have used it” to divide the city, often for political gains such as garnering votes.
Sharon Crane said that she was opposed to the cameras and alleged that any money made from violations had only been spent “on the more affluent side of town.”
Miller stated that only 1 percent of drivers were issued tickets from the cameras and asserted that they follow a very liberal policy in terms of allowing drivers to exceed the speed limit.
The cameras issue $50 citations to drivers who speed or run red lights, and they were installed at four locations on busy roadways in April 2009. The controversial five-year contract was approved in a 4-3 vote in August 2008, and it had called for up to 15 cameras in Oak Ridge. Three of the current systems are near schools.
“Redflex is disappointed in the Council's decision to terminate their traffic safety camera contract,” Redflex Communications Director Jody Ryan said Monday night. “Results from the program showed positive safety benefits for the community. Additionally, revenue from the program was allocated to roadway improvements, making the streets of Oak Ridge safer for drivers, pedestrians, and other road users. Redflex wishes the City of Oak Ridge continued success with their traffic safety efforts.”
Although most of the council was divided on the camera contract issue on Monday, most members seemed interested in asking the city's traffic safety board to conduct a traffic study.
Also Monday, the council agreed in a 5-2 vote to have the traffic safety board consider a proposal to install a traffic signal on Oak Ridge Turnpike near Oak Ridge High School, where one of the camera systems is currently located. Council could reconsider the stoplight proposal in four months.
More information will be added as it becomes available. See previous story here.

As the value of bitcoin started to soar, it began to attract more mainstream investors and eventually caught the interest of financial professionals. Now, the same thing is happening with other digital currencies.
The latest evidence of this is Bloomberg's decision to add prices for three other crypto-currences—Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin—to its terminal service, which is used by major banks and investment houses worldwide.
The addition amounts to a validation of sorts for the digital currencies, which have been around for a while but have always been second fiddle to bitcoin:
Come one, come all — @TheTerminal has officially added ether, litecoin and ripple pricing pic.twitter.com/RDGchH5QEP — Lily Katz (@LilyKatz) December 14, 2017
While the three digital currencies rely on similar distributed ledger technology, as does bitcoin, they are quite different from one another.
Ethereum relies on a more versatile type of software that has made it a popular platform for many other digital tokens, while Litecoin is built as a quicker, more efficient clone of bitcoin. Ripple, meanwhile, is actually a private company that provides blockchain technology to banks, and allows some of its currency (known as XRP) to trade in the open market).
Ethereum saw a remarkable price jump early in the year when it suddenly soared from under $10 to around $200 in a few months, and is now trading near $700. Litecoin saw a similar but more recent price jump, while Ripple has experienced a series of surges in the last year.
The interest in these other so-called “alt-currencies” likely represents speculators looking for alternatives given how expensive bitcoin has become (it's currently trading around $16,500).
Bloomberg declined to comment on the decision to add the new alt-currencies to the terminal, but a person familiar with the company said they were added as a feature for foreign-exchange traders.
The person added that the terminal data is drawn from prices provided by Bitstamp. The Luxembourg-based exchange is one of several platforms for obtaining digital currency in a market where price spreads can differ significantly from exchange to exchange.
Last week, the San Francisco 49ers announced they signed tight end Garrett Celek to a contract extension. He was due to hit free agent next week, but instead agreed to terms on a 4-year deal worth $14 million. The deal included $5 milliojn in guaranteed money.
We now have full details on the contract. The deal is in fact worth $10.2 million over four years, with $4 million in incentives. He received $3.5 million fully guaranteed, which is made up of a $2.5 million signing bonus and his $1 million base salary in 2016. Celek also receives $350,000 in per game roster bonuses ($21,875 per game) in each season, as well as $50,000 workout bonuses each year.
The $4 million in incentives are considered NLTBE, which means Not Likely to be Earned. They will not impact the salary cap unless he actually reaches the incentives. They include receptions and receiving yards each year. They are $1 million per year, but as of right now I don't know the thresholds for these incentives. Celek's average per year is $2.55 million, and below is the complete breakdown, including cap hit each season.
Signing bonus: $2.5 million (cap hit is $625,000 per season)
2016
Base salary: $1 million (fully guaranteed at signing)
Roster bonus: $350,000 (paid $21,875 per game)

All in all, this is a very team friendly deal. It will depend in part on how they utilize him in Chip Kelly's offense, but the numbers are manageable. This deal knocks $2.025 million off the 49ers 2016 salary cap space, which leaves them with $57,588,018.
We don't have full details of Quinton Dial's contract yet. We know there is a $3.2 million signing bonus, which prorates out to $800,000 per year starting this year. It is an extension on his current deal, so it is likely that his 2016 salary does not change much, if at all. We can likely subtract that $800,000 from the $57 million in cap space to get a better handle on the 49ers cap space this year.

Sols 1164-1165: Brushing "Swartkloofberg"
13 November 2015
The rover drove over 38 meters on Sol 1162, as expected. We are transitioning out of restricted planning, so only 2 sols are being planned for this weekend. There were so many good ideas for activities this morning that the team had to decide which to remove from the plan to leave enough charge in the rover's batteries to enable nominal planning on Monday. Still, the plan is a very full one: On Sol 1164, ChemCam and Mastcam will observe one of the Bagnold Dunes that is a near-term goal for detailed investigation, plus other more nearby targets called "Swakop" and "Zaris." After another AEGIS checkout activity, the arm will be deployed to take a MAHLI image of the REMS UV sensor and of a rock dubbed "Swartkloofberg." Then the DRT will brush the dust off Swartkloofberg and MAHLI will acquire mosaics of the brushed spot and of Swakop before the APXS is placed on the brushed spot for
an overnight integration.
On Sol 1165, the arm will be stowed and the rover will drive farther south, again orienting the vehicle for REMS wind measurements. After sunset, SAM will clean its scrubbers, an engineering activity that has been performed twice before. Finally, the rover will go to sleep and recharge in preparation for the next sol's activities.

Today, Lyft announced that it will be rolling out the ability to schedule rides ahead of time in San Francisco at no extra cost. No, Lyft isn't departing from its "on demand" roots; it still works pretty much the same, just with a scheduling option.
Essentially, a rider schedules a pickup (24 hours in advance max) but the platform won't request the car until just before the scheduled time. So drivers will still have the ability to accept or reject a ride. If one rejects it, Lyft's routing algorithm will send the request to the next available driver.
The ride request will go out an undisclosed amount of time before the scheduled pickup time in order to leave enough room for drivers to accept and then arrive on time (the company wouldn't specify how much time before the pickup the request goes out because they're testing what works best).
The company is still testing what to do during prime time — Lyft's version of surge pricing — to see whether the increased fare will affect scheduled rides.
"We're looking at all the possible scenarios to see what the best experience for passengers and drivers will be," Lyft spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt told Recode.
It's a feature that passengers have asked for in the past, he said. And one that Gett, which is only available in New York in the U.S. but operates all over Europe and Israel, has offered for more than a year. Advance booking, according to Gett CEO Shahar Waiser, is a major advantage when it comes to business-to-business services.
The new feature stands in stark contrast to many of Lyft and Uber's other services. With carpool imitators like LyftLine and UberPool — which are cheaper than personal rides — Uber and Lyft have looked more and more like public transportation or shuttle services. The scheduled ride, on the other hand, is a staple of black car and limo services that often cater to people traveling for business, to the airport, or for corporate accounts in general.
Update: This post was updated to include details on how the service will work during "prime time.
Stephania Bell details the difficult road Jimmy Graham has ahead of him as he attempts to return to game action. (1:08)
Throughout the offseason, Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll has expressed optimism that tight end Jimmy Graham will be able to return and contribute to the offense in 2016.
Graham sustained a ruptured patellar tendon in a Nov. 29 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He did some light jogging and caught passes from Russell Wilson before practices during the spring. Carroll said that the team won't rush Graham during training camp, but he expects the tight end to be ready for Week 1 of the regular season, barring unforeseeable issues.
By all accounts, Graham is doing everything in his power to get back on the field, but there's no downplaying the seriousness of his injury.

During a recent podcast, ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell explained why it's so difficult to come back from patellar tendon ruptures.
"It's this big tendon that anchors your quad, that large muscle in the front of your thigh, to your shin," she said. "So when it ruptures, essentially you incapacitate your quad. That's why guys go down in a heap when the injury happens."
New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz suffered a ruptured patellar tendon in 2014. Last season, he was sidelined by a calf injury, but Bell noted that the issues could have been connected.
"If you look at what Victor Cruz said later in the season, he said, 'I believe that calf injury came from me compensating always having that leg -- because it was on the opposite side -- had to do all the work while I was recovering from the patellar tendon injury,'" Bell said.
There are two questions with Graham. One is: When will he return to the field? And the second is: What will he look like when he does come back?
Bell said the biggest issue athletes have after this specific injury is regaining their strength and explosiveness. Even if they are able to get back to where they were, it often doesn't happen in the first year back.
"A study just published in June of this year in the American Journal of Sports Medicine looked at orthopedic procedures on over 550 NFL athletes," Bell said. "And of all the different surgeries that these guys have, those who fared the worst when it comes to rate of return to play and performance metrics like yards gained and touchdowns scored, [it was] patellar tendon repair.
"And their careers were shortened overall significantly. It's not to say that one individual can't come back and be phenomenal, but it's telling you that the odds are against them in terms of returning to form."
The Seahawks are committed to giving Graham every opportunity to come back and be a difference-maker. There doesn't appear to be any scenario where he'll be left off the roster in 2016.
But Graham's contract carries a cap hit of $10 million in 2017. In other words, the Seahawks will have a decision to make depending on how he looks this year. History is not on Graham's side, but he'll try to do everything in his power to be the exception when it comes to athletes returning from patellar tendon injuries.
The New Australian Sitcom We've All Been Waiting For!
When James Padley and Jayden White met at drama school, they had no idea they would become best mates, let alone business partners.
On a January day in 2009, Jayden and James turned up to the Victorian College of the Arts, both nervous and apprehensive about their first day in the newly formed Bachelor of Musical Theatre, accredited by the University of Melbourne. They were both wearing flannelette shirts and, seeking familiarity, were drawn to partner one another in their first class. Little did they know, their “flannies” were the common ground that would soon form the basis of a lifelong friendship.
The pair have since endured their twenties side by side and have come out the other end with a wealth of knowledge and experience, a bucket load of laugh-out-loud stories and a great sense of humour with which to tell them. “People don't believe us when we tell them that a lot of the stuff in the show has actually happened to us,” admitted Padley, “but we found that our very own Australian performing arts industry, with its huge personalities and infinite creative possibilities, is a fountain of comedic content!”
After graduating from the VCA, both Jayden and James struggled to find work in the entertainment industry. James, who looks far younger than his true age, opens his mouth to produce a deep, rich voice -one you'd expect from a much older, much stockier man. Jayden, a highly trained dancer, is 6'6” in height and is often deemed “too tall” for the stage or screen. Both with scores of talent but with unfortunate personal attributes making them difficult to cast, the two decided to write a show for themselves. And so, Scraping By was born.
The boys began writing as a hobby to distract themselves from the wounds of constant industry rejection and disappointment. Since, they have officially formed their brand, Padley&White, an umbrella under which Scraping By, their first foray into the world of television, has been written.
The three main characters of the show, Jayden, James and Ellie, are all fresh out of university and struggling to make it in the ‘real world'. Set in Melbourne, Australia, Scraping By deals with the day-to-day lives of our immediate millennial population, stuck somewhere between child and adult, chasing perpetual glee, while responsibility continues to hunt them down.
The producers of the show say that Scraping By is “the new Australian sitcom we've all been waiting for!” A series consisting of 20-minute self-contained episodes that build into a larger seasonal arc, the show is essentially based on the balancing act of maintaining a carefree and youthful outlook, while struggling with the inevitable reality of becoming an adult.
To this day, Padley&White still lovingly sport their flannelette shirts and, when asked the key to their natural dialogue and straightforward humour, White replied, “It's just us on the page. We write what we know and it comes with the benefit of already having a detailed knowledge of our characters.” Padley added, “The characters and situations – and especially the relationships – are really just heightened versions of ourselves and our friends, our relationships and the things we've all been through to become who we are today.”
Scraping By is honest, raw comedy – something we rarely see on Australian television. With other American shows of its genre – like Scrubs, New Girl, How I Met Your Mother and Friends – finding international success, Scraping By is the first Australian-made sitcom to use the American formula. Australian television generally opts for a combination of drama and comedy – what Patrick Hill, the show's Executive Producer coins as “dramedy.” “Yes, real topics and real issues evolve throughout the series – the characters are only human­­,” Hill asserts, “but the difference is the way the characters deal with those situations. For Scraping By, comedy remains at the forefront.” Straying away from awkwardness and embarrassment, which has become an overused form of comedy, Scraping By hopes to reinstate the classic set-up and pay-off style of humour.
The series has already attracted interest from independent filmmakers and industry professionals. After recently completing the Melbourne run of Cabaret starring Paul Capsis, Debora Krizak, a lusty leading lady of the Australian stage, will take on the role of Tanya Burke. “We are so stoked to be working with Deb,” beamed Padley, “she has such a depth of talent and her willingness and generosity are more than we could ever have asked for.” Also joining the cast is recent graduate from Federation University's Acting course, Annabelle Tudor. “The role of Ellie, is pivotal to the plot,” explained White, “Annabelle is completely different to how we initially imagined but she showed us an Ellie that was more real than anything we could put on paper.”
The Pilot episode is currently in production and is scheduled to be released online late this year.

Solar Backup Myth
November 24th, 2011 by Nicholas Brown
MYTH: Solar Power Isn't Green When It Requires Backup Gas Power Plants:
Solar opponents often argue that solar power plants create the need for additional power plants. The first problem I noticed with this argument is that the installation of additional electricity generation capacity does not create the need for more electricity.
That is illogical. If you were to cancel the construction of a solar power plant, then this means that electricity would have to come from another power plant, and that is likely a natural gas one. The natural gas power plant would have to operate and burn gas 24 hours per day.
If the solar power plant was installed, then that same natural gas plant would back it up at night, and would operate only a fraction of the time, and, hence, burn a fraction of the gas that it normally would.
During the day, when solar irradiance fluctuates, a relatively small (compared to an entire day of backup) amount of energy storage (batteries are an example) could back up the solar power plant with the excess energy stored from sunny periods.
Second: Such people argue that the natural gas generators required are unable to scale electricity generation up or down when solar power production decreases or increases, respectively. Therefore, they have to stay on all the time.
Note that while some power plants can take hours to start (especially coal and nuclear plants), modern gas peaking plants can start in 10-20 and hydro generators can start almost instantaneously.
The solution to the problem above, nonetheless, is pretty simple — set up an hour (or even less) of energy storage that the solar panels would keep charged, and if it becomes cloudy, the battery will back up the solar power plant by providing electricity for up to an hour, which is plenty of time for the natural gas or hydro power plant to start.
One hour of energy storage is inexpensive and the energy storage would act as a buffer for solar power. Another characteristic about solar panels that complements that is they already generate DC, so no AC to DC conversion is required to charge the batteries.

Ian Smith is now 76 and has told an Australian paper he still has hopes of following in many of his co-stars footsteps and breaking onto the big screen. Let's help make that happen
First off, let's just get one thing straight. Ian Smith is more, much, much more, than Harold Bishop. As he said to the Daily Telegraph in Australia, promoting his and undead Madge's appearance on the 30th-anniversary show: “In my mind I am still a jobbing actor and I can't get used to the fuss that is made about Harold.”
And he has made some movies. He took the title role in 2013's Granddad, in which he helped out a little girl with her first date. He was Buck Senior in 2009's The Jesus Spoon, billed as “a grossout comedy about two boys, a dog turd and a decorative spoon that may, or may not, have magical culinary powers”. But both were shorts, not even topping the 10-minute mark.
There have been features, also. In 1993, at the height of Harold-mania, he was Dr Carrera in Body Melt, in which unwitting residents of a very Ramsey Street-ish cul-de-sac are used to test a new drug which causes rapid body decomposition, throat pain and terrible death (tagline: “The first phase is hallucinogenic… the second phase is glandular… and the third phase is… BODY MELT”). Smith acquits himself well in the trailer, giving real force to his two lines: “Up until their birth, babies are the ultimate parasite” and “What is this?”
But Smith isn't satisfied with this back catalogue. “I've not really broken into the movie world,” he said, “I really would love to do a movie before I hang up my voice.”
Then we got some specifics about his requirements. “A good movie” and “something with a bit of depth in it that stretches and challenges me. Something with a budget.”
Guy Pearce is everywhere. Margot Robbie, increasingly so. Chris and Liam Hemsworth are doing pretty well. Ben Mendelsohn has managed the transition and kept his cred. Even Alan Dale was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. And, of course, only the foolish would put Russell Crowe's career down to anything but those four 1987 episodes as ex-con Kenny Larkin.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Smith flexes his acting chops in this clip from Neighbours
Ian Smith has paid his dues. He's been in more episodes of Neighbours than anyone else ever (reports suggest 1,659). He's survived multiple heart attacks, accidents (car, plane, fire), various cancers, personality changes following a stroke, amnesia triggered by a fall, and he donated a kidney to Lou Carpenter. The least we can do is help secure him some decent movie roles. So get cracking!
Here's an indicator of how the U.S. military considers northern and eastern Africa the next major battlefield of the ongoing war on terrorism. "Countering violent extremist groups" will be the "first priority" of the U.S. Africa Command, according to its next leader.
U.S. Army Gen. David Rodriguez, most recently the day-to-day commander in Afghanistan, all but laid out a hit list to a Senate panel during his confirmation hearing to run the military's newest regional command organization. "A major challenge is effectively countering violent extremist organizations, especially the growth of Mali as an al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb safe haven, Boko Haram in Nigeria, and al-Shabaab in Somalia," Rodriguez told the Senate Armed Services Committee in advanced questions on Thursday morning, as "each present a threat to western interests in Africa."
The Senate panel opted not to ask questions about al-Qaida at all – a surprising move, given that Rodriguez testified alongside Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, nominated to command all U.S. military forces in the Middle East and South Asia. Sen. Carl Levin, the chairman of the committee, called the swaths of territory they will oversee "the centers of gravity for our military's operations to counter the threat of terrorism." Yet senators preferred to grill Austin over his recommendations for a residual force in Iraq that never came to pass.
Still, Rodriguez said that the Boko Haram, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Shabab are "the major threats to stability, militarily." He also included Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army – which the U.S. is helping confront – in his list of threats, but as a subordinate issue.
As befitting a new U.S. and western approach of confronting terrorist groups without major land incursions, Rodriguez indicated that "training" foreign militaries would be the primary tool by which Africa Command operates directly. He regretted that previous training for partner armies in Africa, "we did not emphasize the value of the army and the role of the military in democracy" – an issue on display in the recent Mali conflict, when the U.S.-trained military launched a coup last year – and pledged to reverse that course.
Rodriguez did not elaborate at the hearing about additional steps to confront the terrorist threats he outlined. But in his advance statement to the committee, he said that he saw "a greater risk of regional instability if we do not engage aggressively" against al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, the terrorist group's regional affiliate. The Special Operations Command's Africa component is currently focused on "neutraliz[ing]" the group, including 'a counter-ideology component to deny al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb recruitment and retention efforts and interfere with their fundraising." There is a robust and seemingly long-term U.S. military presence in Djibouti that helps provide resource for the ongoing counterterrorism fight. Drone strikes were not discussed at the hearing.
There are questions about the extent of the threat that al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Shabab and Boko Haram actually pose to the United States. Rodriguez conceded in his advance questions that the three groups "have not specifically targeted the United States." Instead, they've "carried out attacks on western interests and engaged in kidnapping," he said, warning that they'd be an "even larger threat" if they "deepen their collaboration." Asked by Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Rodriguez said Boko Haram in Nigeria "has committed some acts that can be associated with terrorism." Rudy Atallah, the Pentagon's former top Africa counterterrorism officer, told Danger Room last month that "The short answer is they are regionally focused for now," rather than threatening the United States at home.
Twitterati termed this move as Islamophobic saying it's no longer limited to Hijab only
(Web Desk) – A school in Belgium had sent 30 Muslim school girls home last week for wearing long skirts, baggy pants, dark dresses and skirts over pants after such dresses were banned by the principal.
The principal is quoted by media to have said “the wearing of baggy pants, long skirts or dark dresses, and skirts or dresses over pants is not tolerated.”
This triggered a massive online protest as #jeportemajupecommejeveux (I wear my skirt as I like) trended on Twitter and the principal finally let the students in.
France has already been in the news for sending students with long skirts home because their attire looked against “secularity” of the country.
Here s a report by AJ+
People have termed it a result of Islamophobia. They argue that the anti-Muslim is not restricted only to the burka and Hijab (the head covering) anymore.

Cracked Pokes Fun At Simultaneous Invention
from the patently-funny dept
That's not necessarily how invention works. Aside from the fact that these scientists and inventors often work in teams, even those teams aren't working in a vacuum. They read the scientific literature, and attend conferences, and exchange correspondence with their peers, and in general absorb the thoughts and ideas of their day, thoughts and ideas accessible to everyone else. Indeed, it turns out that many of the biggest inventions and discoveries of all time haven't been made by a single person, but by many people, working more or less independently, in some cases barely finishing their research before they make comical sprints to the patent office, trousers hanging around their ankles.
What happens next is complicated. It involves lawyers, and shadowy visits to the patent office, and bribed patent clerks, and probably some great 19th century insults. The end result of it all being a huge controversy about whether Bell read Gray's preliminary patent paperwork and copied parts of his invention. Understand that this was all before either of the men got their damned inventions to work. Indeed, Bell's famous first words on the telephone occurred while he was testing a device that looked an awful lot like Gray's patent application.
It's no real secret that one of the many problems with the way patents work in the United States is what happens when two or more people produce the same invention independent of one another. Unfortunately, with the USPTO's seeming inability to judge what is obvious to those skilled in the arts and what isn't, the result is typically the guy who got the patent first wins. We've discussed before how inventions that are likely inevitable shouldn't be patented, as there's little progress to reward if the progress was simple eventuality. Still, recognition is sorely lacking for how common this kind of thing is.So, when a popular (and hysterical) site like Cracked.com decides to dedicate one of their famous lists to 5 odd cases of simultaneous invention , including well-known inventions, we hope that injecting that into the common bloodstream gets people thinking. In the process, they get in a few digs at the patent process as well.Indeed. More over, it's not as though these are obscure, trivial inventions that you've never heard of. We're talking about things like the Polio Vaccine, the theory of relativity, and. My personal favorite on the list is an invention hallmark, the telephone. It turns out that Alexander Graham Bell walked into the patent office not only on the same day as a guy named Elisha Gray, but with the intention of patenting a nearly identical invention.The point isn't that Graham didn't contribute. It's that when two or more people invent the same thing simultaneously and independently of one another, the result shouldn't be one of those people getting the kind of monopoly that could result in gold-plated testicles for all the household pets while everyone else is relegated to polishing said testicles to make a little cash. That the patent system can't handle this kind of thing shows a clear flaw. One that hasn't been dealt with since before the telephone, apparently.

Editor's Note: This is part 1 of Mario Vittone's 8-part series from the U.S. Coast Guard's formal hearing into the October 29, 2012 sinking of the tall ship Bounty off the Coast of Hatteras, North Carolina during Hurricane Sandy, resulting in the loss of two lives, including the Captain and a crew member. The hearing took place with the National Transportation Safety Board in February 2013. The Coast Guard's and NTSB's investigation reports can be found here and here, respectively.
By Mario Vittone – With bruising and cuts to his face, broken bones in his hands, chest trauma, a twisted knee, and a dislocated shoulder, John Svendsen swam toward a strobe light. The tall ship Bounty had just sunk underneath him. It was early in the morning of October 29th, last year. He was likely the last person to see the ship's captain, Robin Walbridge, alive as both men crawled across the foundering ship. Several hours (and probably miles) later, Svendsen – the last Chief Mate of Bounty – was pulled from the Atlantic by a Coast Guard MH-60J – lucky to be alive.
This morning he was sitting alone at a desk at the Renaissance Hotel in Portsmouth, Virginia. Commander Kevin Carroll – the man assigned by the U.S.Coast Guard to investigate the incident – engaged him in hours of Q & A. Today's testimony, included the details of Svendsen's injuries, ended at about 4:00 PM Eastern. By the time I drove home from the hearing, local reporters had already misrepresented Svendsen's testimony.
The first time I weighed in about Bounty's sinking I said that if “I've learned anything in my career, it's that speculation rarely lines up with facts.” It turns out that facts rarely line up with facts, either. My own local paper – The Virginian Pilot – reported that Svendsen stated that he “twice urged Walbridge to abandon ship before Walbridge agreed,” and later in the same article reported that “Svendsen twice told Walbridge they should abandon ship before Walbridge agreed. The boat rolled before an orderly evacuation could happen, spilling crew members into the ocean.” Other newspapers used the headline “Mate Pleads with Captain to Abandon Ship.” What they all left out was that the time between his first urging and Walbridge's agreement was two minutes, and he never said that he “pleaded”. Sincerely – there was a time for an “orderly evacuation,” and it was long before Svendsen first urged his captain.
What was made clear by the Chief Mate was that crew members did, indeed, have concerns about leaving New London with Hurricane Sandy on the loose. The Chief Mate brought those concerns to Captain Walbridge before they left port, offering up other options for mooring up-river. The captain held a meeting telling the crew they could stay behind with no hard feelings, but that Bounty was safer at sea than in port, and that he was heading out, according to Svendsen.
Testimony today including a number of things far more concerning than a two-minute dissonance between the mate and the captain. Svendsen testified about alterations to the ship's construction arrangement in the yard period just prior to sailing that including the moving of fuel tanks and the addition of other tanks, new hatches, new tonnage openings and ladders, and all of it without Coast Guard or class oversight. The ship routinely sailed – according to Svendsen's comments on Coast Guard evidence – with sails not in Bounty's approved sail plan and carried removable ballast forbidden by the ship's stability letter. Caulking on the ship's plank seams and the replacement of planking raised eyebrows as well. But without access to all the evidence, it was hard to draw conclusions about what Svendsen was commenting on. There was a picture that none in the gallery could see and a reference to DAP and the number 33. Did the crew that caulked the seams of Bounty in the yards prior to sailing use house-grade DAP sealant on the planking seams? I don't know. It seems more likely that they were bottom coating with Interlux 33 – but these are facts that were alluded to, not verified.
One rumor confirmed by Svendsen was that Bounty routinely needed bilge pumping in normal conditions. “We had to run the pumps once or twice during every four-hour watch.” Bounty made water – lots of it. During his last watch on the morning of October 28th – less than 24 hours before she went down – Svendsen said, ” the bilge pumps were running constantly.” Perhaps he attributed that to the sea state and water coming down from the weather decks, but he hit the rack just after noon thinking the ship was in good shape. Six hours later he was convinced that the ship was taking water through the planking at two spots on the port side (according to his testimony today). Six hours after that, he was alone in the Atlantic and swimming for his life.
After Svendsen's testimony was finished, Carroll and the panel discussed a piece of evidence (CG-12) – a 2010 survey report from the American Bureau of Shipping – that outlined 19 deficiencies requiring attention if Bounty was to be issued a Load Line certificate. The issues ranged from weather-tight fittings and missing hatch gaskets to improper drainage and problems with watertight bulkheads. The Coast Guard investigator kept repeating the phrase “that repair was not done” when referring to an interview with the ship's owner following the sinking. The load line certificate was never issued.
There are seven days of testimony left and I intend to be there for all of them. You can be sure that I'll only tell you what I know for certain based on what I see and hear and I'm not willing to draw conclusions just yet.
It turns out that an investigation is no place for absolutes either – at least not from the press gallery.

Kimmel admitted to being “fascinated” while watching Trump. “His eyes were mostly closed the whole time, his voice was at phone-sex whisper,” he said, opening Jimmy Kimmel Live. Referencing Alec Baldwin's impersonation of Trump on Saturday Night Live, Kimmel joked: “It almost seemed as if he was doing an impression of Alec Baldwin doing an impression of him.”
“He said ‘disaster' and he said ‘bigly' a couple of times, and he said Mexico is sending some bad hombres over here. I guess those Rosetta Stone tapes are paying off,” Kimmel added.
Kimmel's take on the debate was arguably most creative of the lot: in addition to his kickoff monologue, he also aired a presidential debate edition of his Kimmel Kids' Out of Focus segment, in which he rounded up three young toddlers – Quinn, Raniya and Franki – to get their thoughts on the candidates' performances.
Raniya was the most opinionated, saying she didn't enjoy watching the debate because “they argue a lot”, adding later: “It was pretty annoying, 'cause Donald Trump was talking over Hillary.” Kimmel made their visit an educational one: he astonished the children with the revelation that Clinton had attended Trump's wedding to Melania in 2005, and identified Clinton's and Trump's running mates, Tim Kaine and Mike Pence. The group agreed that Pence looks a lot friendlier than Trump, with Quinn adding: “Donald Trump seems like he's losing his mind every day.”
In his Late Show monologue, Stephen Colbert addressed Trump's insinuation that the Emmys are rigged, which he tweeted about in 2012, 2013 and 2014, following snubs for The Apprentice.

Grabbing two of his Emmy awards (he has won nine), Colbert said: “You know, Donald, you really should get one. They're fantastic. I think this year he might get one. If Trump lost to The Amazing Race, this year, it could go to the amazing racist.”
Colbert also blasted Trump's statement about keeping us in suspense as to whether he will accept the outcome of the election, even though immediately before the debate Pence said Trump definitively would accept the result.
“Oh, suspense! Democracy's going to end in a cliffhanger,” Colbert exclaimed. “I guess we're all going to have to wait until November 9 to find out if we still have a country, if Donald Trump is in the mood for a peaceful transfer of power. Or if he's going to wipe his fat ass with the constitution.”
The Daily Show got in on the action early, broadcasting a Facebook Live mock debate with two candles in lieu of the candidates, stationed behind podiums in a zen garden. A hand inserted itself into the frame at random intervals to rake the sand. The debate could be heard in the background but was largely drowned out by the sound of trickling water and ambient music.
During the ensuing show, host Trevor Noah struck a similar tone as Colbert, expressing horror at Trump's threat of not accepting defeat. “I'm sorry, keep us in ‘suspense'?” Noah asked. “Am I the only one super freaked out by this?
“What do you mean you'll keep us in suspense?” he added. “Trump is going to run his campaign like an episode of Scandal, only with less black people and fewer women in power and less understanding of politics. But other than that, exactly like Scandal.”
As for Trump calling Clinton a puppet, Noah joked: “Trump thinks all women are puppets, that's why he's trying to stick his hand up them.”
Know some “Okinawan dialect”? Did you hear it on the popular NHK drama “Churasan,” perhaps? Well, actuawlly, what you get to hear on TV or from younger Okinawans is not a dialect of Okinawan at all but a type of Japanese — namely, Okinawan Japanese.
In fact, Okinawan proper is a language distinct both from Japanese and the other five Ryukyuan languages: Amami, Kunigami, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni. Since Japanese has replaced these languages in almost all contexts in daily life, all six languages are highly endangered today. Only older people speak them, and they speak them rarely.
The six Ryukyuan tongues are therefore listed in the “UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger of Disappearing” compiled by the U.N.'s culture and educational agency. UNESCO supports language revitalization because languages constitute intangible heritage culture. In Okinawa's case, according to UNESCO, all Ryukyuan languages and the cultures expressed through these languages are on course for extinction by 2050.
Japanese was officially introduced in Okinawa in 1880. Prior to that, it had only been used for writing and diplomacy by the court of the independent Ryukyu Kingdom. The first Protestant missionary in Okinawa, Bernard Jean Bettelheim, was unaware that Okinawan was a language distinct from Japanese. While staying in Okinawa between 1846 and 1854, Bettelheim penned a grammar guide to the language he heard around him, only to later find out that it was not Japanese after all. He had studied the “wrong” language and hence had to rename his grammar guide after Japan was opened to the outside world and Bettelheim was exposed to Japanese.
The Ryukyuan languages comprise 750 local dialects, so you had better forget all ideas about the so-called Okinawan dialect, or Okinawa-ben — they are wildly off the mark. All 750 dialects are mutually unintelligible with Japanese. This is not surprising given the fact that Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages separated before the sixth century.
Consider an example of their distinctiveness. If you wanted to say in Japanese, “That person may be home now,” you would say something like, “Ano hito ima uchi ni iru darō.” On Yonaguni Island, however, people would say something like, “Khanu tuu ja nai da ni waruka bagaranun.” This is actually no longer a variant of Japanese (just try making sense of it with a Japanese grammar guide and dictionary!); this is an utterance in another language.
Still, both Yonaguni and Japanese can be said to belong to the same language family, Japonic. The relationship between them is similar to that between languages of the Slavic, Romance or Germanic families. The variance between the Ryukyuan languages and Japanese, by the way, may be best compared to that between English and German.
Since this is not the Bilingual page but the Community section, let's talk about how communities in Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands of Kagoshima are affected by the endangerment of their cultural-heritage languages. Put simply, communities are bound by the borders of their languages because communication is required for sharing the same set of values, ideas, stories, humor, proverbs, collective memories and other experiences that give rise to identities. In other words, distinct languages give rise to distinct identities.
One of my native languages, for example, is German, and I feel German now and then (like during the World Cup!), but I've never felt Danish or Dutch or any other sort of “West-Germanian.” I simply don't know what it's like to “be Dutch” or “be Danish,” and that has much to do with the fact that I speak neither Dutch nor Danish.
In a similar vein, if you don't speak a Ryukyuan language, you will not know what it's like to be part of a Ryukyuan language-speaking community. Hence, with the ongoing disappearance of the Ryukyuan languages, an identity is vanishing as well. When I interviewed language revitalization activist Shinako Oyakawa last year, she stressed that “It's not only about language — it's about the way we want to live.”
Let's go back to the beginning: Japanese began to be spread in the Ryukyu Islands during the process of being absorbed into the Meiji Japanese state between 1872 and 1879. The Ryukyuan court had been forcibly dissolved and the last king, Sho Tai, exiled to Tokyo. Japanese was spread in the islands not only for purposes of communication between Ryukyuans and mainland Japanese, but also with the aim of making Ryukyuans “Japanese.”
This process — called nation building — was taking place across the modern world around this time. Nation building is the imagination of a community that was nonexistent before, and it has always coincided with the spread of one dominant language at the expense of others — French in France, Italian in Italy, Japanese in Japan (incidentally, the names of these languages were invented at the same time). In the case of Japan, non-Japanese-speaking peoples of the Japanese nation at the time included the Ainu and Ryukyuans, as well as the Ogasawara and Hachijo islanders.
From the late 19th century, all other languages of Japan were actively suppressed, stigmatized and banned from specific contexts (school, the bureaucracy, writing, the media, etc.) in order to stifle any kind of identity that might challenge the idea of “being Japanese.” As a result, Japan's indigenous minority languages all became endangered.
Language endangerment happens all over the world, not only in Japan. According to UNESCO, for example, 13 languages are endangered in Germany, 26 in France, 11 in the U.K. and eight in Japan (Ainu, Hachijo and six Ryukyuan languages).
This brings us — finally — to the topic of this column: language revitalization.
Some people might at first think that the loss of endangered languages is no big deal. They may even see it as constituting some sort of “progress.” Upon reflection, however, they might note that it is always weaker, dominated communities that experience language endangerment: Ryukyuans and Ainu in Japan, the Scots and the Welsh in Britain, the Bretons and Gallo in France, the Friulians and Sicilians in Italy, the Sorbs and the Frisians in Germany, and so on.
Experts on endangered languages are all in agreement that language endangerment is a sign of domination of a majority over a minority. Today, endangered languages can often serve to adjust such a relationship between majority and minority. Language revitalization is never attempted for the sake of language alone: Language is used to bring value to the community.
It is not surprising, then, that endangered languages are being revitalized around the world, from Welsh and Breton to Sicilian and Sorbian. These languages have all been put to new uses in an attempt to safeguard them and bring new value to these communities.
Consider the example of the Ryukyuan languages. During its annual symposium in March, the Ryukyuan Heritage Language Society identified the following 12 benefits of revitalizing the Ryukyuan languages.
Language revitalization would: 1) transmit and promote a deeper reflection of the Ryukyus in Ryukyuan languages; 2) restore Ryukyuan self-esteem and confidence; 3) promote Ryukyuan perspectives on language, history and culture in education; 4) restore cohesion between the generations, present and past; 5) familiarize the younger generations with Ryukyuan heritage culture; 6) maintain, strengthen and apply Ryukyuan cultural heritage; 7) contemporize Ryukyuan language and make it relevant for the future; 8) regain control over Ryukyuan self-image and education; 9) maintain choices in language, identity and culture; 10) stop the adaptation of Ryukyuan identities and behaviors toward those of the Japanese mainland; 11) contribute to communal happiness and welfare; 12) recognize Japan's cultural diversity and promote intercultural tolerance.
Note that, despite their level of endangerment and their much smaller size in comparison to Japanese, only Ryukyuan languages can bring these benefits to local Ryukyuan communities.
The link between language revitalization and the gains it brings to communities is an important one for local communities and for the scholars studying them. “Indigenous Languages — Value to the Community” is the topic of an international symposium jointly organized by the Foundation for Endangered Languages and the Ryukyuan Heritage Language Society in Okinawa from Sept. 17 to 20 in Ginowan, southern Okinawa. More than 40 participants from around the world will meet there to discuss how endangered languages can bring new benefits to the communities speaking them. More information on this symposium can be found at www.ryukyuans.org and www.ogmios.org.
Readers interested in the topic but unable to travel to Okinawa in September might consider attending a symposium organized by Linguapax Asia on Sept. 13 at Tokyo's Gakushuin University on the topic of “Endangered Languages Networking — Values and Benefits for the Future” (see www.linguapax-asia.org).
The similarity of the topics is no coincidence: Language really matters for communities and is vital to their wellbeing.

Memes may bear little resemblance to the original material, such as when a local news segment in Alabama about an attempted rape (“He's climbin' in your windows, he's snatchin' your people up,” ranted the victim's brother, Antoine Dodson) mutated into the song, “Bed Intruder,” by Auto-Tune the News, which made the Billboard charts.
So how did an innocent baby photo become a Japanese meme? That's a question for KnowYourMeme.com, a Web site that catalogs Internet memes and produces funny videos that explain how certain memes came into existence. When a reporter asked about the Stephen Rout meme in August, KnowYourMeme sprang into action, creating a page for what it dubbed “Aka-San” (“Mr. Baby” in Japanese).
Photo
With the help of its multilingual readers and Google Insights, a tool that tracks Web searches by time and location, KnowYourMeme pieced together a timeline: It started in 2004, on 2chan.net, a so-called imageboard in Japan that allows users to post images anonymously — essentially a petri dish for meme manipulators.
Who first found Stephen's picture is not known, nor how it was found. What's known is that a 2chan user superimposed Stephen's face over an illustration from a manga comic book, and turned it into an image macro — a simple Web form that allowed users to put words into a cartoon-like thought bubble. The meme-ification of Stephen began.
As Mr. Rout uncovered new permutations of the meme, he was anything but freaked out. An Internet dweller since the days of Usenet, he wasn't afraid for Stephen's safety. Plus, he knew that there was nothing he, or any parent, could do to prevent the use (or misuse) of an image of his child, once it was uploaded to the Web.
Photo
Furthermore, Mr. Rout, now an information technology expert at the University of Florida, understood that the meme really had nothing to do with Stephen qua Stephen — the photo was being treated as a kind of open-source stock image, stripped of any identifier or context.

“The meaning that a piece of work has, comes as much from what the observer brings to it as it comes from what the artist put into it,” Mr. Rout said. “I'm perhaps over-dignifying baby pictures when I talk about them as art, but I think the abstraction applies.”
Mr. Rout's laissez-faire response was a far cry from that of other parents whose children became Internet memes. Take Ghyslain Raza, the chubby 15-year-old from Canada who earned Internet infamy in 2003 when his classmates secretly uploaded an embarrassing video of him whipping around a golf-ball retriever as if it was a light saber. The clip was remixed and mashed up: Mr. Raza doing battle with Agent Smith from “The Matrix,” kayaking through whitewater rapids, and satirized on the animated series “American Dad.”
Photo
THE “Star Wars Kid,” as the video was nicknamed, was viewed 900 million times by 2006, according an estimate by the Viral Factory, a London-based marketing firm. The blitz of attention caused Mr. Raza so much stress he left school and was eventually treated for depression, according to court documents his parents filed in a lawsuit against the classmates' families. (The parties settled out of court.) According to recent news reports, Mr. Raza is now studying law at McGill University in Montreal.
At another end of the spectrum is David DeVore, who recorded his groggy son, also named David, in the backseat of their car after a dental appointment asking existential questions like “Is this real life?” and “Why is this happening to me?” Mr. DeVore uploaded the video, “David After Dentist,” to YouTube, where it went viral, with more than 67 million views.
Within weeks, there were a rash of parodies, including one of Darth Vader asking similar life-searching questions, and a satire by the Upright Citizens Brigade called “David After the Divorce,” in which a young man is dazed after signing divorce papers. It has been viewed on YouTube more than 4 million times.
Photo
The DeVore family has reportedly made $150,000 off YouTube advertising and related merchandise. David even appeared in a low-budget commercial for a toothbrush manufacturer, FireFly, disguised (sort of) as a follow-up video. As for the Routs (who are, it turns out, friends of the DeVores), neither lawsuits nor money seems to be in the offing. “Everybody says, ‘There's got to be money in this.' But gosh, what a vile response,” Mr. Rout said. “I don't want to use this as an opportunity to squeeze some money out of somebody for some purpose. It's an amusement.”
Stephen, who is now 10, echoed his father's sentiment and seems to have taken his meme notoriety in stride, spending his summer instead on karate lessons and the Honor Harrington series of science-fiction novels. “Surprised and really amazed and really weirded out” is how Stephen described the experience by telephone.
But certain aspects of his overseas fame intrigued him — the appearance of his baby face on Japanese television, his placement on Mount Rushmore and particularly the plastic bust created by a fan. “It gets weirder the more you look into it,” he said.
Story highlights Court to examine whether police can take DNA samples after arrest
Case involves challenge to Maryland man by man convicted of rape
Courts have been at odds over when samples can be collected
Supreme Court decision could have implications nationally
The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether police can take DNA samples from criminal suspects following their arrest, a case based on Maryland law with potentially national implications for the use of a popular investigative tool.
Justices will weigh a challenge to the state's law by Alonzo King, who was convicted of a 2003 rape on Maryland's Eastern Shore with the assistance of genetic material obtained following his arrest three years ago on an unrelated assault charge.
King moved to suppress the use of the DNA on Fourth Amendment grounds, but was ultimately convicted of the rape offense.
Federal law in 1994 created a national database in which local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies could compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons. But courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed.
A divided Maryland Court of Appeals agreed with King, saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon. This, the court said, outweighed the state's law enforcement interests.
The appeals court also said that obtaining King's DNA immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting.
State officials asked the Supreme Court to intervene, saying the state court ruling "resulted in the loss of a valuable crime-fighting tool." They said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective, there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting "biometric information."
The Supreme Court allowed the Maryland law to remain in effect in July while appeals from the state were filed, and Chief Justice John Roberts signaled at the time his tentative support for the measure.
"Collecting DNA from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population," Roberts wrote.
"Crimes for which DNA evidence is implicated tend to be serious, and serious crimes cause serious injuries. That Maryland may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm."
Roberts said at the time there was a "fair prospect" the Supreme Court would ultimately find in favor of the state on the search and seizure questions.
Roberts said the state appeals decision would resonate beyond Maryland because DNA samples taken on the state level "may otherwise be eligible" for the FBI's database. "The decision," Roberts said "renders the database less effective for other states and the federal government."
The Maryland law is set to expire at the end of 2013. A Supreme Court ruling is expected by June.
The case is Maryland v. King (12-207)
A new drinking game is swimming into sports bars: goldfish racing.
Bars in Seattle, Kentucky, The Hamptons and elsewhere have drafted ordinary orange goldfish to compete, spurred by drunk patrons and water guns.

At Tailgaters Sports Bar and Grill in Antioch, California, the first Tuesday of every month brings out at least a dozen contestants who compete on a college basketball style playoff bracket. Feeder goldfish are raced along a 10-foot track using straws or squirt guns to motivate the fish, in a tournament that spans anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes, explained owner William Lohr via email. Tailgaters' competitions are free to enter and the winner gets a $25 gift certificate. The goldfish are released in a private pond after the races.
Competitors range from about 21-30 years old, and can win hundreds of dollars, depending on the size of the weekly pot from the $5 draft fee incurred from each racing goldfish.
Goldfish racing, while evidently completely legal in the U.S., operates more or less underground (er, underwater), following the end of Seattle bar Harmon Tap Room's goldfish racing night. This was apparently due to emails and phone calls from PETA, which made enough waves for the establishment to cease the racing.
PETA is openly against goldfish racing as well as the giveaway of goldfish as a common carnival prize, saying on its website, "They deserve better than to be doled out as trinkets."

Though the origins of fish racing are mysterious, the rise of goldfish racing in the U.S. is traced back to the now-shuttered Gypsy Bar and Velvet Lounge in Portland, Oregon. In 2010, a chef reportedly saw goldfish racing online and brought a 9-foot track with runway lights into the bar, which also served cocktails in fishbowls.
In order to keep animal rights activists from shutting down their operations, many bars don't openly promote goldfish races, and several goldfish racing organizers and competitors refused to comment for this piece.
Isaac Price, manager of winter-themed bar Woodsky's in Seattle and bartender who works the Tuesday night goldfish races, doesn't believe that racing the fish is harmful. “The act of spraying water into water at a fish doesn't seem as if it harms the goldfish,” he said. “The fact that most goldfish are sold as feeder fish and fed to bigger animals [means] I feel we are providing another venue for the fish to live a longer life.”
At Woodsky's, anyone mistreats or “messing with the fish” is kicked out, and fish that grow too big for the track are retired from racing.
Price, who has never actually raced a goldfish himself, describes the tournaments as fun and exciting. “Everyone is rooting on the person they want to win and cheering for their favorite named fish,” he said.

Mike Maguire, a 23-year-old Microsoft employee who lives in Capitol Hill, Seattle, competed in Woodsky's goldfish racing one night after hearing about it from a friend.
“It was strange form of entertainment,” he said. “I did some research before so it wasn't so surprising.” Maguire said he wouldn't go back, as regulars appeared much more skilled and knew the “tricks” to win the grand prize in the tournament style racing.
Goldfish racing isn't just for your basic bros. In June 2014, retired NBA champion Scottie Pippen won at his first round of goldfish racing at Two Keys Tavern in Kentucky, but couldn't keep up in the second round, reported TMZ.
Nothing can replace belting out “Don't Stop Believing” into a microphone at your local bar, but as interest rises in goldfish racing across the nation, don't be surprised if a few descendants of your childhood pets swim into your favorite bar.
WASHINGTON — Rep. Steve Russell was disappointed that his religious freedom amendment was stripped from a federal defense-spending bill the House passed on Friday. But the Oklahoma Republican is encouraged he will prevail in the long-term, telling BuzzFeed News that the incoming Trump administration has given him “very good assurances” it would address the issue upon taking office.
“These issues will be resolved, and we have gotten some very good assurances moving forward,” Russell said at the Capitol, suggesting Trump could take executive action without waiting for Congress. “I am certainly encouraged by the signs that I am getting from the administration that is inbound.”
Russell said he has "gotten very positive signals” that Trump team would step in where his amendment was blocked, but added that he was not going "to talk strategy or predispose what the executive branch may do," specifically, on the matter.
Dubbed the Russell Amendment, Russell's religious freedom legislation became a lightning rod this year for Democrats, who said it would let religiously affiliated federal contractors discriminate against LGBT people.
They argued Russell crafted the measure to undermine President Obama's 2014 executive order that banned LGBT discrimination by federal contractors.
In an interview, Russell did not deny that Obama's LGBT order was his target, arguing the order threatened contracts for Catholic organizations and other religiously affiliated groups.
“The vagueness was created by the executive branch, so the executive branch [under Trump] could un-create the vagueness," he said. "You reverse it by clarifying a bad executive order with a good one."
The Russell Amendment would have ensured religious tenets would not be an impediment to federal contracts for religious corporations, religious associations, religious educational institutions, or religious societies.
LGBT advocates worried it would permit corporations that make even a superficial claim of religious belief to discriminate against LGBT people within the company, or to deny services to customers, while still receiving taxpayer money.
Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democratic member on the House Armed Services Committee, was on a conference committee of four lawmakers who stripped the Russell Amendment from the the defense funding bill. The committee's two Republicans, Sen. John McCain and Rep. Mac Thornberry, were not necessarily opposed to the amendment, he said, but saw an opening in the future.
"They were confident they would have a better environment for a variety of different issues in the new administration," Smith told BuzzFeed News. "It worries me a great deal."
McCain declined to comment on why the Russell Amendment was stripped from the National Defense Authorization Act in an interview with BuzzFeed News, but he said he was open to similar legislation in the future.
“As a general outlook, I think those religious-based organizations should be allowed to make decisions that are in keeping with their religious beliefs,” the Arizona Republican said.
As BuzzFeed News reported in October, LGBT advocates have been worried that Trump could reverse LGBT rights in several ways upon taking office, including rescinding Obama's 2014 order or expanding on a 2002 order by president George W. Bush to protect the religious rights of religious social service groups.
Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request to comment on whether it has given assurances to expand the religious freedom rights of federal contractors.

Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh - On Monday, December 30, 2013, five year old Sayedul Islam left with his grandmother from Nayapara refugee camp for a visit to Gojobil villaige in Maungdaw Township of Arakan (Rakhine) state of Myanmar. They had planned a one week visit there, to stay with family. They planned to cross secretly over that night by soliciting a boatman.
The boat that the young boy and his grandmother, Tahera Begum left on had a total of 15 people aboard for the night crossing. The boat sank in the middle of Naf River just after 7pm.
Three dead bodies were pulled from the water near the Bangladesh frontier. They were taken by police for autopsy.
6 people were found alive near Myanmar by fishermen. Among them, Tahera Begum. She has not gained consciousness since being taken from the water.
6 people are still missing. Five year old Sayedul is among those not recovered.
Sayedul Islam, son of Shah Alam who died in road accident four years ago. He was born in Nayapara refugee camp. RB News visited his mother, Minara Begum, whom he lives with. She explained that her son had not yet been given an identification card from the Bangladesh UNCHR office. With her and her 2 daughters and 2 sons crying, she searched through a box in her hut to show his picture. She couldn't find it. Not one image of her young son, lost at sea. Just memories.
Amongst the sorrow of a family, ever more eroded by loss and hardship RB News asked one last question to Minara Begum. What is your sons favourite colour?
Blue. His favourite colour was blue.
For the past several years Donna and I have attended the Battered Mothers Custody Conference and so we have been able to interact with domestic violence experts. Both of us were surprised to discover that although most of the worst spousal assault perpetrators have personality profiles indicative of sociopathy/psychopathy this fact is not recognized by many experts.
I have worked to become well acquainted with the scientific literature regarding intimate partner violence because I teach psychology of gender and because I very much want to understand why people who should know better often fail to diagnose sociopathy in perpetrators. This failure to diagnose has lead to intimate partner violence being erroneously interpreted as a gender issue related to male domination of females. This flies in the face of the real statistics which show that there are equal numbers of female perpetrators. The failure to recognize personality disturbance in female perpetrators has lead to male victims being further traumatized.
I am happy to report that the leading expert on intimate partner violence, Professor Donald Dutton of the University of British Columbia is fighting to correct the above misconceptions and to help people understand that domestic violence is perpetrated by disordered men and women.
In 1979, he cofounded the Assaultive Husbands Project, a court-mandated treatment program for men convicted of spousal assault. He has frequently served as an expert witness in civil trials involving intimate abuse and in criminal trials involving family violence. Dr. Dutton has published over 100 papers and four books, including Domestic Assault of Women, The Batterer: A Psychological Profile, Rethinking Domestic Violence and The Abusive Personality Violence and Control in Intimate Relationships.
I just finished reading The Abusive Personality and recommend it highly. In this book Dr. Dutton details the profile and personality structure of both male and female batterers. He makes a compelling case for his contention that personality disturbance is behind domestic violence in Western society. Next week I will summarize the personality profile of “Abusers” and explain how abuse relates to sociopathy/psychopathy.
AUGUSTA, Maine (July21, 2015) – A Maine bill that drastically restricts the use of drones by state and local law enforcement, and serves to thwart one aspect of the federal surveillance state, became law earlier this month.
Introduced by Rep. Diane Russell (D-Portland) and co-sponsored by Sen. Eric Brakey (R-Androscoggin), Legislative Document 25 (LD25) prohibits warrantless drone surveillance with only a few exceptions, requires local legislative approval before an agency can acquire drones and sets out minimum standards for drone operation. This represents a major first step against drone spying in Maine.
The legislation became law as of July 2 without Gov. Paul LePage's signature.
There was some controversy surrounding enactment of LD25. The governor contended that he had more time to act on the legislation, along with 18 other bills. But Maine Attorney General Janet Mills issued an opinion saying LePage missed the 10-day window allowed under the state constitution to act on the bills. The governor could conceivably challenge the AG's ruling.
The new law bars the use of drones “for criminal investigations without a warrant…except as permitted by a recognized exception to the requirement for a warrant under the Constitution of Maine or the United States Constitution.” The law also includes an outright ban on weaponized drones.
Law enforcement agencies may no longer purchase drones without the approval from the local governing body overseeing them. This empowers the people in a local community to stop their police from using drones altogether through their representative bodies.
In addition, law enforcement agencies may not “conduct surveillance of private citizens peacefully exercising their constitutional rights of free speech and assembly.”
The new law does allow law enforcement to “use an unmanned aerial vehicle for the purpose of a search and rescue operation when the law enforcement agency determines that use of an unmanned aerial vehicle is necessary to alleviate an immediate danger to any person or for training exercises related to such uses.”
Impact on the Federal Surveillance State
Although the new Maine law focuses exclusively on state and local drone use and does not apply directly to federal agencies, it throws a high hurdle in front of some federal programs.
Much of the funding for drones at the state and local level comes from the federal government, in and of itself a constitutional violation. In return, federal agencies tap into the information gathered by state and local law enforcement through fusion centers and a federal program known as the information sharing environment.
According to its website, the ISE “provides analysts, operators, and investigators with information needed to enhance national security. These analysts, operators, and investigators… have mission needs to collaborate and share information with each other and with private sector partners and our foreign allies.” In other words, ISE serves as a conduit for the sharing of information gathered without a warrant.
The federal government encourages and funds a network of drones at to sate and local level across the U.S., thereby gaining access to a massive data pool on Americans without having to expend the resources to collect the information itself. By placing restrictions on drone use, state and local governments limit the data available that the feds can access.
In a nutshell, without state and local cooperation, the feds have a much more difficult time gathering information. This represents a major blow to the surveillance state and a win for privacy.

A Florida congressman angered District leaders on Thursday when he equated the city's push for expanded authority to control its own budget to the pleas of his children when they were teenagers seeking greater leverage.
"When my kids were young -- teenagers -- they wanted budget autonomy, too," Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., told WTTG-TV. "You allow them to go their own way. When they get out of line, according to the Constitution, the Congress has the right to step in."
District officials, who have said in recent months that the city's relationship with Congress appeared to be thawing, were flabbergasted.
"To compare the District to children is both absurd and arrogant," said Pedro Ribeiro, Mayor Vincent Gray's spokesman. "Last time I checked, children don't have a $6 billion local budget."
And Kimberly Perry, executive director of the advocacy group DC Vote, blasted Mica's remarks.
"The residents of D.C. are Americans who pay federal taxes and fight and die in wars," Perry said. "They should be treated with respect. Rep. Mica's demeaning comments ignore a sad truth: The District manages the tax dollars of its residents better than most jurisdictions. Our federal budget problems are well-documented."
Mica made his comments two days after District voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the city's charter to allow D.C. leaders to spend local dollars without Capitol Hill's approval.
His comments could fuel local anxiety that congressional Republicans will mount an attempt to block the vote's effects.
It remains unclear, however, whether the GOP could muster enough support to torpedo the measure using a parliamentary tactic it has employed only three times in the city's history.
Although Republicans enjoy firm control of the House, Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate. Both chambers would have to approve resolutions to stop the amendment from moving forward.
President Obama would also have to back such a measure, which appears unlikely after he included a call for local control of finances in his own budget proposal earlier this month.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting member of the House, has warned, though, that Republicans could use other approaches to prevent granting the city budget autonomy.

J.K. Rowling has no time for Internet trolls.
On Friday, while in the midst of an otherwise civil discussion on the recent British elections, a Twitter user named "Steve" sent a number of especially hateful messages to the Harry Potter author after she'd been tweeting about the results.
The tweets were hastily deleted, but not before Rowling's epic smackdown and a decidedly pointed jab at his "manlihood."
Dodging the thrust of Rowling's jab, Josiah doubled down on his vitriol.
Some came to Rowling's defense with follow-up questions:
Shortly after, Rowling followed up with another tweet confirming she wasn't the only one who felt Josiah's comments were unwarranted and her response was on point.
Twitter has since disabled Josiah's account.
Though this tweet was decidedly more biting than some of her others, Rowling's response is part of her long history online combating trolls and lifting up her fans. In March, she gave an easy explanation to a fan about why she made Hogwarts principal Albus Dumbledore gay, while in January she also stood up for Muslims around the world against the bigotry of Fox News chief Rupert Murdoch. Just this week, when a desperate fan who had given up on life came to her, her response was predictably inspiring.
The Internet can sometimes be as ugly as a Slytherin frat party, but with users like J.K. on the watch, good can still triumph.

The Orlando Magic reached terms on a contract extension Tuesday with center Nikola Vucevic, according to team sources.

Sources told ESPN.com that Vucevic has received a new four-year deal from the Magic worth $53 million that will kick in starting with the 2014-15 season.
The Orlando Sentinel first reported Tuesday that the sides were finalizing a new deal.
Vucevic becomes the fifth former 2011 first-round pick to land an extension before the Oct. 31 deadline, jo‎ining Cleveland's Kyrie Irving, Denver's Kenneth Faried and twins Markieff and Marcus Morris of the Phoenix Suns.
‎Vucevic turns 25 on Friday and has established himself as a consistent double-double man for the Magic, who acquired him from Philadelphia as part of the four-team blockbuster deal in August 2012 that landed Dwight Howard with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Vucevic is one of only five players in the league to average at least 10 rebounds per game in each of the last two seasons, jo‎ining ‎Kevin Love, Joakim Noah, Zach Randolph and Howard himself.
‎Magic forward Tobias Harris is also eligible for an extension before the Halloween deadline. Class of 2011 first-rounders who are still with the teams that drafted them and don't secure an extension this month become restricted free agents in July 2015.
San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard, Golden State's Klay Thompson, Minnesota's Ricky Rubio, Charlotte's Kemba Walker, Chicago's Jimmy Butler, Cleveland's Tristan Thompson, Oklahoma City's Reggie Jackson and Milwaukee's Brandon Knight are among the most prominent 2011 first-rounders currently in extension negotiations with their respective teams.

'Thinking Out Loud' is up for three awards. Here's why that makes total sense.
Ed Sheeran ‘Wasn't Expecting' Three Grammy Nominations — But We Were
Nominations for the 58th Annual Grammy Awards were announced Monday morning (Dec. 7), and besides Kendrick Lamar's 11 nods and Taylor Swift's 7, one of the least surprising nominations was Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud," up for Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.
Well, we weren't surprised. But based on a tweet he sent out shortly after the noms went live, Ed was.
No one should be surprised by a handful of Grammy noms for "Thinking Out Loud," a gentle ballad with an aching chorus and a romantically barebones music video. These are the exact qualities that Grammy-winning songs have historically had!
Of course, there are a whole host of other reasons why the song was destined for Grammy nomination glory from the very beginning.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a knife attack on a young couple in Hamburg, which claimed the life of a teenager and left his girlfriend injured.
The incident, which was not widely reported, happened late in the evening of October 16 when the victim, 16, and his girlfriend, 15, were sitting down beneath the Kennedy Bridge in the Germany port city. The suspect remains at large and his identity is unknown.
News of the stabbing comes just a day after four people were stabbed at a railway station in Frankfurt, although the motive behind the attack remains unclear.
ISIS has claimed responsibility for the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old boy beneath Kennedy Bridge in Hamburg prompting fears he is the first victim of the terror group on German soil
According to police investigating the stabbing in Hamburg, a man approached the couple from behind and suddenly stabbed the boy - identified only as Victor by police - several times. The attacker then pushed the girl into the Outer Alster Lake before fleeing.
The girl managed to escape from the water and alert emergency services, but Victor died a short time later in a city clinic from multiple stab wounds.
On Saturday, the ISIS news agency Amaq claimed responsibility for the murder.
'A soldier of the Islamic State stabbed two individuals in Hamburg on the 16th of this month. He carried out the operation in response to calls to target the citizens of coalition countries,' Amaq said in a statement.
If true, the killing would be the first lethal attack carried out by the terror group on German soil.
Tributes have been left at the scene by those who knew the victim.
'Victor - we miss you', reads one, while another tribute is written on a banner: 'Our beloved friend, we think of you and miss you.'
An Afghan refugee who pledged allegiance to the terror group attacked passengers on a train with an axe in July and was killed by police, but his victims survived.
A sign reading, 'Victor - we miss you', has been placed at the site of the stabbing in Hamburg
Another tribute to Victor on a banner reads: 'Our beloved friend, we think of you and miss you'
People walk past a memorial to the 16-year-old victim, who was stabbed earlier this month
A week later, a suicide bomber killed himself with a home-made bomb outside a cafe in Ansbach, injuring 19 people, with no fatalities.
Hamburg police said they are looking for a man of 'southern' appearance, is estimated between 23 to 25-years-old and 5ft 9in to 6ft 2in tall. He has stubble and short, dark hair.
The authorities have not commented on the possible terrorist link.
It remains unclear whether four people stabbed at a Frankfurt railway station on Saturday were targeted as the result of a random attack or an Islamic radical.
It was a Sunday treat: a gentle tropical breeze skimmed over the glassy waters of Nosy Be, at the north-west tip of Madagascar; there was barely a cloud decorating the picturesque island. It was a good day to explore.
I wanted to learn from locals about Malagasy reality and how they build their lives from the ocean — perhaps something in common with me, as I've been working at sea for sixteen years. Paddling out in our kayaks, we hoped to strike up a morning conversation with the local fishermen about their way of life.
Squinting into the morning sun, I could make out a fisherman in a canoe. My crewmate Seom Gyun and I paddled towards him. His name was Dudu. He's in his mid-thirties and his face was beaming as we approached. He wished to sell his catch but was embarrassed to say; four hours after dropping anchor at sunrise, he only had a few fish. I smiled back, suggesting we pay to share his bounty and cook them together in his favourite style at his home.
Surprised by the gesture, Dudu called over to another fisherman to ask if he had more. The second man was called Lilatse –– younger than Dudu by about ten years. Lilatse had caught more than Dudu but his catch was for his family waiting on land. We invited him to join us later anyway.
Back on shore, Dudu showed us around the wooden floors, bamboo slats and coconut leaf roofing of his typical ‘trano' (Malagasy for ‘house'), which he built with his own hands 15 years ago. His walls were decorated with certificates from his time working on foreign fishing vessels. As he cleaned and prepared his catch, he told us stories of his ventures out to sea.
“We are here for research,” I said, vaguely, when Dudu asked what we were doing in Nosy Be. ‘Expose… Thai Union… Bycatch… Replenish…' –– these were the words that jumbled in my head but my hands turned to helping prepare Dudu's catch.
The tondro – a small fish – was filled with garlic, pilipily (a Malagasy chili), salt and tsohafohyi, a native Madagascan lemon. Lilatse arrived, happy that he had fed his family and gladly accepting his drink – but still incredulous at the sight of Seom Gyun and I are sitting in Dudu's trano, he refused to be called ‘Lilatse.' “John Wayne, okay,” he requested. I gave a nod and a tap on my chest: “John Wayne,” I agreed.
The Tondro Firiry, a Malagasy name for fried fish, was served with French bread and salad. Dudu was still feeling guilty, insisting he could have paddled out earlier in his lakana to catch more for us to eat. “I am sorry for the few fish today,” he said.
That was my cue. I told him what we were really doing in their waters. He listened intently as I told him about our search for FADs (Fishing Aggregating Devices) and how we were dismantling them. I told him we wanted to help replenish lost marine life and, hopefully, help people like him preserve the livelihood that is slowly dying due to destructive industrial fishing. “Good,” he said, as he turned the tondro over. We may not have brought him a greater catch today, I thought to myself, but I was glad he understood we shared a purpose.
Around 3pm, the tide rose by about four metres. Dudu's lakana was tied up almost 100 metres away to the jetty and he paddled out with John Wayne to escort us. As we said our goodbyes, Dudu and John Wayne called me ‘Ralahy' – Malagasy for ‘my brother.' I paddled back to the Esperanza more determined than ever to help stop the plunder brought about by companies like Thai Union that starves Dudu of the full bucket of fish that he deserves.
“We must make life easier,” Dudu had said earlier. When I think of him setting out in his tarakan under the ‘maswandro' (sun), or the ‘fanjava' (moon) and ‘zavono' (stars), I can't help but agree.

Some may refer to The Simpsons as "genius" but nobody expected this.
A new book titled The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets claims that donut-loving Homer Simpson nearly predicted the mass of the Higgs boson 14 years before any scientist.
During the episode "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace," which aired in September 1998, Homer writes an equation on a chalkboard, which turns out to be an equation that nearly predicts the mass of the Higgs boson a.k.a. the "God Particle."
The book's author Simon Singh told The Independent, "that equation predicts the mass of the Higgs boson." He added, "If you work it out, you get the mass of a Higgs boson that's only a bit larger than the nano-mass of a Higgs boson actually is. It's kind of amazing as Homer makes this prediction 14 years before it was discovered.”
The Higgs boson "is the mechanism that gives mass to elementary objects, meaning that its existence helps explain the existence of virtually everything else," Mashable's Lance Ulanoff explained in 2013.
Below is a video from 2013 in which Singh explains Homer's solution.
Mr. Wray said he was working to ensure that politics stayed out of the F.B.I.'s investigations.
“I am emphasizing in every audience I can inside the bureau that our decisions need to be made based on nothing other than the facts and the law and our rules and our processes and our core values and not based on any political considerations by any side of the aisle,” he said.
Another Republican, Matt Gaetz of Florida, pointed out that a senior prosecutor on Mr. Mueller's team, Andrew Weissmann, had praised Sally Q. Yates, the former deputy attorney general who defied Mr. Trump over his travel ban and was fired. Mr. Gaetz wondered whether Mr. Weissmann's actions demonstrated political bias.
Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, even attacked Mr. Mueller, who served both Republican and Democratic presidents as F.B.I. director and is usually held in high regard by politicians. Mr. Gohmert said that Mr. Mueller had weakened the F.B.I. because of bad management decisions he made as director.
Mr. Wray said the bureau would not hesitate to hold people responsible after the Justice Department's inspector general finished its lengthy review of how James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director whom Mr. Trump fired in May, and others handled the Clinton investigation.
The results of that review are expected next year. Mr. Wray said he had not witnessed any political bias among his top lieutenants, most of whom are holdovers from Mr. Comey's tenure.
Mr. Wray had hoped to keep the F.B.I. out of the headlines, taking a low-key approach to running the country's premier law enforcement agency. But the F.B.I. has been repeatedly thrust back into the spotlight as a frequent target of Mr. Trump's ire, who also tweeted over the weekend that the bureau's reputation was the “worst in History!”
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that the president supports the rank-and-file of the F.B.I. but that he takes exception to many of the current leaders of the F.B.I., “particularly those that played politics with the Hillary Clinton email probe,” as well as Mr. Comey.
Mr. Trump's verbal assault over the weekend on the bureau and Mr. Comey, who was widely admired within the F.B.I., has angered and dismayed agents. They want Mr. Wray to defend the F.B.I. but also not play into Mr. Trump's taunts. Some F.B.I. agents who voted for Mr. Trump have privately conceded they made a mistake.
Street Fighter is a very popular fighting game started more than 20 years ago and is favorite among many until now. As time passed, along with famous Street Fighter characters like Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, Guile, Blanka, Dhalsim, Sagat, and Bison, many new other characters have been introduced in this video game. Many artists inspired to create different artworks and concepts of Street Fighter and Kode is one of them.
Today, we will showcase hyper realistic Street Fighter characters art from Kode's portfolio (a very talented designer). Kode is a graphic artist from Melbourne, Australia. He started drawing when he was only 6 years old and still he has not taken the pen out of his hand.
After transferring his skills to a digital platform Kode was able to expose his work to a wider audience a move that came with great success. We hope his work on Street Fighter will surely inspire you.

President Trump hosted Pearl Harbor Survivors at the White House Thursday to honor the anniversary of the tragic event, after which he eviscerated CNN's Jim Acosta.
The heart warming ceremony involved some great commentary between Trump and the five veterans who survived the Japanese surprise attack. At the end of the ceremony Trump invited the elderly men into the Oval Office, and as they were heading out of the room, Acosta shouted a question at Trump.
Acosta asked if Trump had a reaction to Al Franken's comments earlier in his resignation speech, during which the outgoing Minnesota senator said there's “irony in the fact” he is resigning while “a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office.”
Acosta shouted this question to Trump as he exited the room with the Pearl Harbor veterans:
Any comment on senator Al Franken? He made some comments about you earlier today.
Trump paused and with the strength of the Pearl Harbor veterans behind him, shut CNN down with five words:
I didn't hear it. Sorry.
I asked POTUS about Al Franken's comments about him a few moments ago. Trump's response: "I didn't hear it." — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) December 7, 2017
Then Trump left the room, flanked by American heroes.
The end.

One of my maps in action.
The Ravensmere Academy map I created was born from a need of my weekly role playing group. We wanted a map for our campaign, and noticed there were not a lot of choices for detailed maps in modern settings. I put my CAD draftsman skills to work and created the map, but realized I did not have the right computer at home to do the kind of details the map required. That's when the idea of the Kickstarter campaign came to light.
If our group needed maps, quite surely other people were looking for more choices as well. If I had a faster, better computer, I would be able to create maps for a variety of campaigns for us as well as any other GMs who wanted them.
After researching online, I discovered that $2000 would meet my needs for the map projects. The budget breaks down like this:
Start Up Costs:
Logo Design- $100
Map Test Printing- $100
Other misc costs- $45
Marketing and Advertising:
Marketing Consulting- $250
Advertising- $100
Projected Kickstarter and 3rd party fees: (ranges between $175-$200)
Computer:
One similar to Dell XPS 8700 (includes Intel Core i7-4790 processor, 8m cache, up to 4.0 GHz, 16 GB Dual Channel DDR3 1600MHz- 4 DIMMs, 2TB hard drive, and more.) $1299.99
This brings our total cost to approximately $2069.99-$2094.99, which is how we came up with the $2000 total goal.
The specs on the computer are important for running the types of programs I use. I am accustomed to working with AutoCAD, a program used in architectural drafting to create both 2D plans and 3D models. I will also be using Google SketchUp and Photoshop Elements to create the finished product. This makes visualizing the layouts easier, resulting in more authentic maps, but is also more computer-intensive than 2D image programs, therefore requiring a stronger computer.
I am hoping that you will be able to contribute to my project, and have the benefit of the maps for your own use.
The Ravensmere Academy Culver Hall map, and all future maps, will be distributed in PDF format, printable to 24x36, and are scaled for use with 25mm minis.

I rehab far too many athletes under the age of 18 with ACL tears. In many cases, I am rehabbing some who have suffered multiple ACL ruptures before they graduate from high school. The burning question is why do so many clients suffer a graft failure or contralateral injury so so often?
Is it related to genetics? Is sports specialization to blame? Perhaps fatigue and limited recovery is a problem. I think the answer is multifactorial, but to be perfectly honest we as a profession have yet to truly arrive at a consensus as to when the “right time” to return to play is. Opinions vary widely based on the athlete, sport, native movement patterns, graft choice, additional injuries (ligament, cartilage or soft tissue) and the provider.
As a clinician dedicated to both prevention and the best rehab, I am always re-evlauating my own algorithm and rehab techniques, while looking for scientific rationale to direct my exercise selection and decision making processes. A recent paper by Webster and Feller in the November 2016 edition of AJSM looked at subsequent ACL injuries in subjects who underwent their primary ACLR under the age of 20 utilizing a hamstring autograft reconstruction procedure.
In a nutshell, this study's key points are:
Authors sought to explore the influence of sex and age groupings (<18 years vs 18-19 years at the time of surgery) on the risk of subsequent ACL injury
354 consecutive patients who were younger than 20 years when they underwent their first primary hamstring tendon autograft ACL reconstruction
#of subsequent ACL injuries (graft rupture or a contralateral injury to the native ACL) was determined at a mean follow-up of 5 years (range, 3-10 years)
Subgroup analysis included sex and age (<18 years vs 18-19 years at the time of surgery) comparisons
Graft ruptures occurred in 57 patients (18%) at an average time of 1.8 years after surgery
Almost half (47%) occurred within the first postoperative year, and 74% occurred within the first 2 years
Highest graft rupture rate of 28.3% was in the youngest males (<18 years), and this was significantly higher than in females of the same age (12.9%), as well as in male patients older than 18 years (13.8%)
Contralateral ACL injuries occurred in 56 patients (17.7%) at an average time of 3.7 years after surgery
No significant age- or sex-based differences for contralateral ACL injuries
total number of patients who had at least 1 further ACL injury subsequent to the primary surgery was 110 (35%)
So in essence, here is what we know from this paper:
High re-injury rate was confirmed Early graft ruptures were more prevalent in patients who underwent surgery when they were younger than 18 years versus those in the 18- to 19-year age group Males had higher rate than females with the highest risk in the group < 18 y/o
It is important to note this paper was looking at only HS autograft reconstructions. In addition, other studies have found females to be at a higher re-injury risk, so this is yet another grouping of data.
My preferential graft for younger athletes undergoing primary ACLR going back to cutting, pivoting and jumping sports is a patella tendon autograft reconstruction based on years of clinical experience and the faster graft incorporation. There are drawbacks for every graft, and the PT graft offers potential anterior knee pain, extension loss and stiffness, but I believe these factors can be managed with good rehab. The one factor that cannot be controlled is the size of the graft that can be taken and this may be the one consideration to think on.
There is literature to support the use of many types of grafts. It all begins with proper surgery (good placement of the tunnels and graft) followed by good rehab and of course patient compliance. Overall, I feel we are learning more all the time, but future research must address the impacts of neural fatigue (total practice time, recovery, and risk factor of too many games in a short period of time), ideal time frame for return to sport after primary reconstruction, fear of re-injury (kinesiophobia) and the impact of targeted neuromuscular training following a primary reconstruction and its impact on secondary prevention.
Age has been identified as an obvious risk factor for re-injury, but it is also likely that younger athletes are far more likely to resume higher risk sports/activity. Genetics and biomechanics are internal risk factors that must also be considered (family history, alignment, innate movement quality for example) to help guide us in counseling parents, coaches and athletes about future participation and return to play decision making.

Firestorm, the armies of the Great Cities and the elite of the Death Guard
Get ready to conquer the Mortal Realms and build an empire to last the ages – Firestorm is coming soon, alongside the new Great Cities boxed sets. Meanwhile, in the 41st Millennium, the armoury of the Death Guard continues to grow with a new unit and the return of a reviled and revered commander of the Legion.
Firestorm is a new way to play Warhammer Age of Sigmar, allowing you and your friends to battle for supremacy in map-based campaigns. As you win battles, you'll be able to capture territories and build a kingdom of your own, adding powerful gameplay benefits to your army. Inside the box, you'll find the campaign map, decks of dominion cards for each player and stickers to mark your impact on the Realm of Fire – all of these are fully reusable, meaning after one Firestorm campaign you're free to set up another one. There are unique strategic challenges to map-based play for gamers, while for narrative players this is an easy way to structure a campaign. Firestorm has been designed to be compatible with any kind of play – you can fight your battles in tense games of Skirmish or try the new siege rules from the General's Handbook 2017, or even string them together to create varied, rich, and thematic games.
There's more! Firestorm comes with 10 new allegiance abilities representing the unique armies of the Great Cities and those who would tear them down. The Great Cities are the kingdoms of Order in the Mortal Realms, each home to a unique and varied collection of humans, elves, duardin and Stormcast Eternals. You may remember some of them from the Season of War campaign, such as the Greywater Fastness, others you may have already explored, like Hammerhal, while some are completely new, like Tempest's Eye. The new allegiance abilities are designed to represent how these cities fight; the forces of the Phonecium, for instance, are inspired to fight harder by the deaths of their comrades, honouring the Ur-Phoenix, while the armies of Anvilgard crush their foes underfoot in relentless marches. We'll be previewing some of these next week in detail – what's more, these are usable in any of your games, not just Firestorm!
To get you started with your Great Cities army, we're releasing 3 new boxed sets of miniatures. Each of these is packed with a range of models from the Order Grand Alliance, as well as a rules sheet to let you use your Great Cities rules in your games of Warhammer Age of Sigmar.
Finally, in the 41st Millennium, the warriors of the Plague God continue to gather, with more elite troops arriving for the XIV Legion. The Blightlord Terminators are the vanguard of the Death Guard, combining advanced wargear with arcane gifts of plague. These guys are a reinvention of the Chaos Terminators you may have used in past editions, equipped with a range of weapons you'll be familiar with (reaper autocannons, combi-weapons and the like) as well as deadly new tools like the flail of corruption.
Accompanying the Blightlord Terminators is Typhus, the Herald of Nurgle. Reinvented for the new codex, Typhus has been upgraded to combine classic elements of his design with a new Death Guard flair, meaning he fits in perfectly with the rest of the range. Similarly, dedicated Death Guard fans will notice the similarity between this model and its counterpart from the 31st Millennium. If you're looking for a leader for your Death Guard army (or just want to make your Poxwalkers more powerful), then Typhus is an excellent choice.
Firestorm, the new Great Cities boxed sets, Typhus and the Blightlord Terminators will be available to pre-order on Saturday the 23rd of September – let us know what you're most excited about on the Warhammer Age of Sigmar and the Warhammer 40,000 Facebook pages!
VANDALS have caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to cars over two nights of mayhem across north Edinburgh.
More than 30 vehicles were targeted by vandals – with rocks hurled from a bridge at moving traffic in one frightening attack.
Drivers and community groups blamed rampaging youths for the carnage during the school break.
“It was the school holidays and they went wild,” said a 36-year-old mother-of-two whose car was hit with bricks from the West Granton Access bridge in Pilton. “It's endangering lives and I've had a lucky escape,” she added, saying a rock pierced the front bumper of her Renault Clio.
Drivers reported 17 cars being vandalised across West Pilton on a single night, including a community minibus, with windows smashed and wing mirrors kicked off.
An 18-year-old worker at Sainsbury's, Craigleith Retail Park, returned to her car at night to find £1500 damage, with her windscreen smashed and passenger door kicked in.
“The police told me it was a group of youths who were at a fast-food place because they had them on CCTV,” she said.
“It's just boredom and happens all the time, but is worse in the holidays. It's just mindless vandalism and they're not getting anything from it.”
Another 17 cars were damaged in Craigentinny on Tuesday night, including windscreens smashed along Loganlea Terrace.
“I feel that they should put more cameras and have more vigilance down here,” said a 27-year-old mother-of-two and hospitality supervisor whose Picanto was hit.
A brickie's labourer had the rear window of his Ford Fiesta smashed with a spade and a 36-year-old cleaner had the windscreen to her Renault Megane stamped in.
Barbara Beaufoy, secretary of community group TRIM and Friends of West Pilton, blamed “nice weather and school holidays” and called for vandals to be caught and dealt with.
“Our residents have suffered this blight on our community long enough,” she said.
Cllr Steve Cardownie, SNP member for Forth, which includes West Pilton, said: “For hard-working people in the area to come out in the morning and find their cars damaged for no reason at all is ludicrous and abhorrent.”
Craigentinny/Duddingston member, Cllr Alex Lunn, has asked police and council officials to investigate the Loganlea cases.
Community Sergeant Gordon Duff said: “Tackling youth-related disorder and vandalism is a priority for us and we continue to focus our patrols to address these issues.
“Anyone found to be involved in crimes of this nature will be robustly dealt with and I would ask anyone with information relating to these offences to contact police immediately.”
SNP MSP Ben Macpherson met with police, the Crown Office and community groups yesterday to discuss antisocial behaviour including joyriding on stolen motorbikes.
“It was abundantly clear in the meeting that everyone wants to emphasise that the majority of young people in the area are not engaging in this activity,” he said.
“They are making positive contributions to their community and this is a credit to all those involved.”

In spite of the sheer majority of the news coming out today focusing around the now availability of Samsung's latest flagship devices, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, as well as HTC's latest offering, the HTC One M9. The rest of the news is continuing. In particular, that of the latest Android 5.0 (Lollipop) update and who is getting it. Although, the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and One M9 all come running Lollipop out of the box, there are those current device owners who are still waiting on their lollipop update to arrive.
Well, in respect of Lollipop, the latest news is that there are a few LG tablets which are expected to get their update in the coming days. In fact, the date being of arrival for the update is April 12th. The three devices in question are the LG G Pad range, including the G Pad 7.0, G Pad 8.3 and G Pad 10.1. According to LG, all three of these devices will see their update becoming live from April 12th. These updates will be coming in the form of an OTA which means it will most likely be staggered and not all users will get the update at the same time. Therefore, if you do own one of these devices, then just be informed that the OTA is beginning to be pushed out starting from the 12th.
However, LG also does state that there will be a downloadable update ready to be pulled and pushed to your LG G Pad device from Sunday. So if you do not want to wait for the OTA then it is assumed you will be able to head straight over to the website and grab your download to manually update. Changes noted by LG include improved UI design, new notifications, better battery management and greater computing power. The news of the update should be welcomed news for those who own one of the LG G Pad devices, as currently it seems only the LG G Pad 8.3 GPe is the only device to so far be bumped up to Lollipop. If you do own one, then keep a look out for your update over the weekend.
This photo provided by Allegheny Health Network from Monday shows an X-ray of a chain saw blade embedded in the neck of a patient at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. (Allegheny Health Network/AP)
A tree-trimmer named James Valentine is recovering after his GOOD LORD LOOK AT THAT PHOTO. Okay. Sorry. Hang on. Let's try this again: A tree-trimmer named James Valentine is recovering after an accident sent the chainsaw blade into his neck and shoulder. I will repeat: Chainsaw. Neck and shoulder. Just look at that X-ray! Look at that picture of a chainsaw stuck in a guy's body! A picture is worth a thousand [sits down, catches breath].
Valentine was sawing a tree trunk in Ross, a town outside of Pittsburgh, when the blade kicked back and cut into him. “It was the worst pain you could ever imagine,” Valentine told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.
He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors found that the chainsaw missed his carotid artery by less than half an inch. Valentine, who is expected to make a full recovery, plans to return to work in a week or two.
KIC 8462852 (or Tabby's star) made headlines in October of last year because of very deep and very unusual drops in its brightness, which led to speculation that the star might be home to a Type-2 alien civilization. Since then, new discoveries (e.g. Montet and Simon, 2016) have continued to baffle researchers.
The following video depicts the transit produced by the model, with some slight noise
added so that motion is noticeable.
Along the X axis, transit opacity can be approximated with a very simple formula, as follows:
This type of equation is common in biology. It's equivalent to the Monod equation (Monod, 1949) and the Michaelis–Menten equation. I made a couple modifications: Opacity is truncated at some ceiling, and the coefficient (φ) is different on the left and right sides of the structure, in order to properly model the transit's asymmetry.
Along the Y axis, opacity is a Gaussian function. I could have made it a band with fixed opacity within some bounds along the Y axis, which would look more artificial, but there are algorithmic reasons (a discrete grid) why a Gaussian allows the optimization process to produce a more accurate fit.
Day-1519 Drop
The largest drop has its opacity peak on day 1519 of the Kepler mission, and is also known as
the D1500 drop. It is considerably more chaotic than D800, so I modeled it in a different way.
The baseline model is still a Monod equation, more or less, but I added Gaussian alterations
to the baseline opacity at 3 different points along the band.
The fit is still good (RMSE ~ 0.0044) despite how chaotic this light curve is, and despite the fact that the model only has 9 more parameters than the one I optimized to fit D800. The following video depicts the modeled transit for D1500.
Day-1568 Drop
I modeled the third-largest drop in a similar manner. This is a considerably smaller drop than the other two. The fit is good (RMSE ~ 0.0023) but there is not a lot of variance in the light curve.
Conclusion
I have proposed a type of model that is mathematically simple and, with slight variations, is able to produce excellent fits for all the major brightness drops observed in Tabby's star. If this is the correct type of model — its goodness of fit is highly encouraging — the following hypotheses should be considered:
1) Tabby's star has one ore more partially constructed Niven Rings. All partial rings are likely in the same orbital plane and possibly the same orbit.
2) Tabby's star hosts a Dyson Swarm, and some objects in the swarm cluster alongside shared orbits, with an object distribution given by an approximation of a Monod equation. Perhaps the distribution is intentional in D800, and meant to be a beacon.
3) We might be looking at the birth of an accretion disk, or a partial accretion disk. Perhaps Tabby's star is being slowly swallowed by another star or a black hole. Perhaps there's a natural reason why disk material would approximate a Monod distribution, quite perfectly sometimes, and chaotically on different occasions.

There has been scant success in coming up with astrophysical models that explain these drops. Bodman&Quillen (2015), for example, propose a comet family model. Nevertheless, as the authors admit, they are unable to model the second-largest flux drop because "the flux changes too smoothly and too slowly to be easily explained with a simple comet family model." Additionally, the fit they provide for the largest and third-largest drops is not very impressive once you examine those drops individually at a larger scale.The day-792 drop (also known as D800) cannot be produced by any solid object, natural or artificial, with a shape that makes any sense. Nor can it be produced by a family of, say, hundreds of objects, because of how smooth the light curve is. That drop would have to be produced by a swarm of countless small objects distributed in a very peculiar way. It can't be a cloud of dust, because of how the optical depth seems to distribute, unless it's a very flat or very elongated cloud of dust.I have attempted to model the optical depth of these transits previously, based on a couple different assumptions: (1) That optical depth increases with distance from a point in an imaginary orbiting sphere, and (2) That optical depth increases depending on the distance from a vertical line in an imaginary orbiting sphere. It's possible to get fairly acceptable fits based on these assumptions.Now, there is a third way to distribute the optical depth, which I hadn't attempted previously: As a thin band of material distributed alongside an orbit. It turns out that such a model producesI was getting with models based on the aforementioned assumptions.The following chart shows the observed flux measurements alongside the light curve produced by an optimized band model. The fit is excellent (RMSE ~ 0.0011) for a model with only 7 parameters that participate in the optimization process and an additional handful of hyperparameters.

(CNN) -- In Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where there is opposition to the building of a mosque, protesters are reported to have gathered at the construction site shouting, "Islam is not a religion!" When I read this in my local paper, I thought about how the people of Murfreesboro's Islamic community must have felt at the sight of their neighbors rallying against them and their religion.
America has a proud tradition as an immigrant nation, but it also has a long history of marginalizing those it marks as "other." America's other heritage includes suspicion, hostility, abuse and even death, leveled against ethnic groups as they arrived one after another in waves over the past 2½ centuries.
I learned much about this as I researched "The Family Corleone," a novel I wrote based on a screenplay by Mario Puzo. The novel is about, among other things, Italian-Americans living in New York during the depression.
CNN Profiles: Ed Falco's prequel to "The Godfather"
There were a number of things that surprised me in my initial research. I knew something about our nation's early antipathy toward Catholics and Italians, but I had not fully appreciated the depth of that antagonism. For example, the largest mass lynching in U.S. history took place in New Orleans in 1891 — and it wasn't African-Americans who were lynched, as many of us might assume. It was Italian-Americans.
After nine Italians were tried and found not guilty of murdering New Orleans Police Chief David Hennessy, a mob dragged them from the jail, along with two other Italians being held on unrelated charges, and lynched them all. The lynchings were followed by mass arrests of Italian immigrants throughout New Orleans, and waves of attacks against Italians nationwide.
What was the reaction of our country's leaders to the lynchings? Teddy Roosevelt, not yet president, famously said they were "a rather good thing." The response in The New York Times was worse. A March 16, 1891, editorial referred to the victims of the lynchings as "... sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins." An editorial the next day argued that: "Lynch law was the only course open to the people of New Orleans. ..."
John Parker, who helped organize the lynch mob, later went on to be governor of Louisiana. In 1911, he said of Italians that they were "just a little worse than the Negro, being if anything filthier in [their] habits, lawless, and treacherous."
In addition to prejudice based on ethnicity, Italian immigrants also had to face an older hostility toward their religion. In earlier centuries, Catholics in America were in a position similar to today's Muslims. In 1785, when Catholics proposed building St. Peter's Church in the heart of Manhattan, city officials, fearing the papacy and sinister foreign influences, forced them to relocate outside the city limits. In this incident, it's easy to hear echoes of the Murfreesboro protests, as well as the ongoing protests against an Islamic center proposed for 51 Park Place in contemporary Manhattan.
On December 24, 1806, two decades after St. Peter's was built on Church Street, where it still stands, protesters surrounded the church, outraged by mysterious ceremonies going on inside, ceremonies we now commonly understand to be the celebration of Christmas. The Christmas Eve 1806 protest led to a riot in which dozens were injured and a policeman was killed.
The decades go by, they turn into centuries, and we forget. We've forgotten the depth of prejudice and outright hatred faced by Italian immigrants in America. We've forgotten the degree to which we once feared and distrusted Catholics. If we remembered, I wonder how much it might change the way we think about today's immigrant populations, or our attitudes toward Muslims?
The question of prejudice toward Italians and Catholics was ancillary to my writing project, something I wanted to better understand in order to fully imagine my characters. Nonetheless, the research left me with even greater respect for generations of Italian Catholic immigrants who struggled to make their way in a world so initially hostile to them and to their religion; and by extrapolation, for all immigrants and members of minority faiths everywhere, in every historical period, including our own, who face similar struggles.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Falco.
Usually, and for understandable reasons, the CIA frowns on people comparing it to Nazis, whether the insult comes from random trolls or the president of the United States. Rarer still are Nazi comparisons coming from the CIA's own contractors.
Vanishingly, once-in-a-lifetime, Halley's Comet-rare are the times when those CIA contractors will not only compare the agency to Nazis, but themselves to the manufacturers of poison gas used in the Holocaust—and do it in their own defense.
As contractor psychologists for the agency, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen played an integral role in designing the CIA's post-9/11 torture program.They personally waterboarded Abu Zubaydah, a detainee effectively used as human guinea pig for torture. And the company they subsequently founded to contract with the CIA on the brutal interrogations earned them $81 million, according to the 2014 Senate torture report. Senator Dianne Feinstein called it “a stain on our values and on our history.”
Unlike every senior U.S. official who ordered and implemented the program, Mitchell and Jessen now face civil – though not criminal – liability. Three survivors of the CIA torture program have sued the two contractors in federal court for compensatory damages. They are joined by the estate of Gul Rahman, who died from hypothermia in CIA custody in November 2002 in an undisclosed prison in Afghanistan known as Cobalt. Jessen was present for Rahman's interrogation.
After failing to convince a federal judge in Washington state to dismiss the suit, attorneys for Mitchell and Jessen have settled on an unexpected argument ahead of a critical Friday court hearing. They're like contractors to Nazis and other war criminals, attorneys claim, but the sort that war-crimes tribunals have exonerated.
In a recent filing in the case, Mitchell and Jessen's attorneys portray the two contract psychologists as analogous to those who made the Zyklon B gas used to murder Jews and others in Nazi concentration camps.
Mitchell and Jessen's lawyers note that in a British military court in 1946, the Zyklon manufacturing company Tesch & Stabenow's “first gassing technician” was ultimately acquitted. Although the technician, Joachim Drohsin, played “an integral part of the supply and use of the poison gas,” the British court wrote, he was “without influence” and was found not guilty.
“Here,” Mitchell and Jessen's attorneys argue, “it is undisputed that, as independent contractors serving on a larger interrogation team, Defendants lacked authority to ‘control, prevent or modify' the CIA's decision to use [torture] on detainees.”
Since the contractors were unable to make the decision to torture – instead designing torture regimens for the CIA and implementing them – their lawyers contend they are modern-day Drohsins, supplying modern-day Zyklon and advising on its use. (The 1946 court found the owner and second-in-command at the Zyklon manufacturing firm guilty and condemned them to death.)
It is not the only Nazi comparison Mitchell and Jessen roll out in their defense.
The psychologists note that the Nuremberg tribunals acquitted Karl Rasche, a banker who loaned SS head Heinrich Himmler, the architect of the Jewish “Final Solution,” large sums of money. The tribunal said the loan was like offering “raw materials” to a “builder of a house that the seller knows will be used for an unlawful purpose,” a point the contractors' attorneys seized upon.
“By providing a list of pre-existing SERE [survival, evasion, resistance, escape] techniques to the CIA – which had already decided to use an approach on Zubaydah ‘different' from the FBI's – Defendants, at most, provided the ‘raw materials,'” Mitchell and Jessen's attorneys write.
“It is extraordinarily rare for anyone to willingly compare themselves to people who aided and abetted some of the worst crimes in human history,” Dror Levin, an ACLU attorney representing the torture survivors, told The Daily Beast.
At other points in their brief, Mitchell and Jessen contend that the three surviving detainees were too small-time for them to focus on, as the contractors only focused on so-called “HVTs,” or high-value targets. (Though the 2014 Senate torture report recounts in exhaustive detail how the techniques they designed for Abu Zubaydah – from the bodily contortions called “stress positions” to prolonged nudity to days-long sleep deprivations – were used on at least 118 others.)
But they cannot say the same for the now-deceased Gul Rahman. Instead, they have a different exculpation in mind.
“Jessen only applied a single ‘insult slap' in a non-EIT [enhanced interrogation techniques, a torture euphemism] context to Rahman under the authority of the Chief of Base (“COB”) for Cobalt,” the attorneys write.
On Friday, a judge will hear the opposing sides' arguments for why the case should or shouldn't proceed to a full trial. But in their filing, Mitchell and Jessen have already written a new chapter in their own legacy.
“Like Ruehl and Graf in the Nuremberg trials, and Drosihn in Zyklon B , even if Defendants' played an ‘integral part of the supply and use of the' EITs (which they did not) this too could not render them liable for the CIA's alleged ‘criminal use' on Plaintiffs,” the attorneys write, “as Defendants had no ‘influence' over the application of EITs on such unknown detainees selected by the CIA.”
Recently, the fear of a Fox only future has become much more real. Techniques once thought impossible for human hands are becoming commonplace, with players such as Hax executing frame perfect techniques such as double-shine grab on shield consistently. However, I don't see a future where everyone plays Fox; instead, the community has been doing work optimizing other characters as a whole.
Sheik
Sheik's game has started to stagnate, and the rising popularity of Fox, one of her worst matchups, has further hurt her recent performances. However, with some optimizations in her game, Sheik can return to prominence.
With perfect reaction tech chasing, a Sheik can zero to death Fox, Falco, and Falcon off of a single grab. Many top Sheiks, like Mew2king for example, often go for reads on their tech chases instead of reacting to the tech option, thus giving a chance for a whiffed punish that they get nothing for. Reaction tech chasing is certainly possible, and putting some hours in the lab can make a world of a difference. Spending some time in 1/2 speed in Training Mode and looking at the individual frames of the Space Animal's tech animations with the 20XX Hack Pack's “Develop” Debug Mode toggle have really helped to improve my personal reaction tech chasing. For more information on potential optimizations with Sheik, check out DruggedFox's fellow MIOM article.
Advancing Sheik's metagame, Shroomed has put a lot of work into furthering Sheik's neutral game since switching from Doc. Shroomed has beaten Mew2king, widely renowned as the best Sheik for years, in Sheik dittos twice: he narrowly beat Mew2king in a BO5 in Sheik dittos at Pacific Northwest Regionals (although M2K did go Fox one game and later got revenge by 3-0ing Shroomed in Loser's Finals) and cleanly beat him again in a BO3 at Apex 2015. Mew2king's Sheik, while unparalleled in punish game, has stagnated in other elements of the game while Shroomed has worked to improve Sheik as a character.
Captain Falcon
Falcon was one of the characters most hurt by the recent rise of Fox. With Hax switching to Fox in early 2014, Falcon has been left in the dust. However, there are several tools Falcons can use to further develop his own game.
Falcon's movement is arguably the best in the game. With proper use of Pivots and Shield Stops, Falcon's already awe-inspiring movement gains numerous new tools. A pivot allows you to control space without the lag of a wavedash, and shield stopping gives more options out of a dash.
For examples of players furthering Falcon's meta, look all over! Whether it's S2J with his unorthodox yet somehow amazing combo game to Wizzrobe with his magnificent punishes and coverage of tech options, Falcons everywhere have been putting a lot of work into furthering his game.
Educational Streams and YouTube Channels
Smash Practice with Zhu and Cactus
Smash Practice with Zhu and Cactus is an educational YouTube channel and stream every Thursday that talks about concepts in Melee in a very in depth manner. Zhu and Cactuar break down the topic they're discussing into its very basic details, and then slowly build up what the player should be doing and thinking about in that area. Smash Practice's strength lies in Cactuar's eloquence of speech and ability to break even abstract concepts down into easily understandable terms, while Zhu provides a needed light hearted dialogue that helps to evaluate and understand the concept. Also, their comedic banter and chemistry is impeccable, meaning any interaction between the two is always both fun and educational.
20GX
20GX is a stream and YouTube channel from the Florida Falcons Gravy, Gahtzu, and Wizzrobe. 20GX is specifically tailored for higher level Falcon mains. 20GX's strength lies in the utter depth that they go into topics; while Smash Practice breaks concepts down and then builds them up, 20GX jumps right into new techniques and covers them completely. While this may make it hard to understand for lower level players, 20GX doesn't waste time needlessly going over basic concepts for experienced players. The utter amount of knowledge about Falcon that Gravy has is astounding. Additionally, the channel is useful for more than just Falcon mains. 20GX's video dissecting the mechanics of jump, which goes into tech chasing, shield stops, and general momentum out of dash, significantly helped to improve my tech chasing and practice with Sheik.
SSBM Tutorials by Kira and Kellen
SSBM Tutorials by Kira and Kellen is a YouTube channel that provides educational videos for numerous characters in Melee. Whereas Smash Practice focuses on concepts and 20GX focuses on Falcon specifically, SSBM Tutorials has videos from beginner to advanced techniques for most of the Melee Top Tiers, with more diversity on the way. SSBM Tutorials' strength lies in its succinctness, focus, and visual aids. Due to the nature of a scripted video versus an improvisational stream, Kira and Kellen can edit the videos to be succinct and have visual aids whereas a stream is more often just a person speaking on the spot. However, due to the short length of the videos, SSBM Tutorials often doesn't go as in depth concept wise as Smash Practice or 20GX.
PewPewUniversity
PewPewUniversity is a stream and YouTube channel by PewPewU. PewPewUniversity combines the short length of SSBM Tutorials with the personality of a streamed video. PewPewUniversity differs from Smash Practice and 20GX in that PewPewU performs the stream alone; in his videos, he speaks directly to the audience rather than a streaming partner, thus creating a more personal educational video. PewPewU's videos focus on Marth, but the concepts he discusses can be used by most characters.
Zero to Hero
Zero to Hero, run by MIOM's own Tafokints, features concept overview and match analysis and of a new player in Atrioc, a Twitch employee. Every Monday on the MeleeItOnMe Twitch, Tafokints analyzes Atrioc's recent tournament sets and thus helps him to see his nooby mistakes. For newer players, this stream will help you to see what you potentially could be doing poorly or help you to understand how to analyze your own tournament sets. As both Tafo and Atrioc are Sheik mains, Zero to Hero focuses on Sheik, although the concepts discussed can help in all matchups.
Conclusion
Melee is an extremely deep game with much, much more still waiting to be discovered, implemented, and perfected. Always be searching for new techniques and strategies to better your game and character. Make sure to use the educational resources available to you. And as always, happy smashing!
China's ‘rise' in Asia is creating considerable tension with Washington and its allies. There are disputes in the East and South China Seas, heated rhetoric over freedom of navigation operations, economic competition, a growing ‘access' challenge pitting Chinese A2/AD vs. American Air-Sea Battle/JAM-GC —the laundry list these days seems almost endless.
So what should America do about it? One idea, boldly put forward by the talented John Glaser in a recent piece in these very pages, is to “ abandon our strategy of primacy ” and that “the United States can relinquish its outsized hegemonic role in East Asia without damaging its core interests.”
He explains:
“China threatens the United States only insofar as America insists on being the dominant power in China's backyard, a policy that actually contributes very little to U.S. security. If we abandon our strategy of primacy, the risk of a clash will shrink away. If we try to contain China's rise, on the other hand, these predictions of doom may prove right.”
Glaser continues on:
“The current approach to China boils down to a kind of measured containment. It manifests in essentially in three ways:
1) maintaining and strengthening U.S. “treaty alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand,” which “are the fulcrum for our strategic turn to the Asia-Pacific”;
2) increasing overall U.S. military presence in the region to develop “a geographically dispersed, politically sustainable force posture in the region”; and
3) further integrating U.S. economic engagement in the region in a way that marginalizes, and in some cases excludes , China.”
After reading this I had a very simple rhetorical question: Why is America doing these three things in the first place? A short list (and not even a comprehensive one), for your reading pleasure below, makes this obvious:
- With double digit budget increases almost every year for the last twenty years, China is building a military that by many people's estimate is focused at defeating America in combat.
- Seizing Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines after backing away from a U.S.-brokered agreement to deescalate tensions.
- Placing oil rigs in Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone—now on multiple occasions.
- Time and time again, effectively declaring the South China Sea its own territory —a body of water that is among the world's most important in terms of trade transiting its space (over $5 trillion worth, with over $1 trillion being U.S. goods).
- Constantly testing Japanese administrative control of various islands in the East China Sea—islands under Tokyo's administrative control since the early 1970s—and nearly sparking multiple fatal collisions in the air.
- Declaring an Air Defense Identification Zone in the East China Sea.
- And now creating fake islands in the South China Sea—islands Beijing could use to effectively enforce its sovereignty claims.
The above—with China casting aside the idea of a ‘peaceful rise'—has forced America to do the bare minimum to ensure the continuity of its so-called ‘primacy' but also something much more important that Glaser sadly ‘glazes' over: the international order in Asia. Keep in mind; this is an order that has been devoid of major great power war since the end of World War II—a peace and prosperity that has allowed China to become the world's second largest economy (if we use GDP as the measure). In fact, while we are on the subject, America has been one of the greatest advocates of China's rise, something multiple administrations have encouraged. Chinese coercion on countless occasions has pushed America to change its thinking—in some instances almost kicking and screaming considering Beijing and Washington enjoy an almost $600 billion dollar bilateral trade relationship. Simply stated: China has changed the rules of the game, so Washington has responded.
And what's so bad about America's so-called primacy in Asia in the first place? Glaser, at least in my view, makes it sound like the Asia-Pacific is some large American vassal state that it should relinquish control of. It should be clear for anyone to see that Washington is the provider of many important net public goods—like those all-important security alliances, nuclear umbrellas and protected sea lanes that allow trade to thrive. As former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman points out:
“The concept of Primacy has underpinned U.S. grand strategy since the end of the Cold War because no other nation was able to provide the collective public goods that have upheld the security of the international system and enabled a period of dramatically increased global economic activity and prosperity. Both the United States and the global system have benefitted from that circumstance.”
But what happens when America gives up its so-called primacy in Asia? Glaser never defines what the end of American primacy in Asia would look like. What are the specifics? Does Washington simply walk away from treaty commitments and alliance guarantees to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines? What about growing strategic relations with Vietnam and India? Does America simply say “sorry” and begin withdrawing its forces from the region? Or does America offer some sort of “grand bargain” to Beijing, where Washington holds a sphere of influence from the shores of California to Hawaii with China holding the rest? What would be the ramifications globally? Could you really imagine President Obama walking up to a microphone and proposing any of this?
As a senior Taiwanese official explained to me when I was in Taipei this fall: “We want more America, not less. Washington is the only thing that ensures China's rise is not Asia's nightmare or that we don't become another Hong Kong.” Each time in the last three years I went to Asia, every senior official I spoke with wanted more American leadership, more American commitment and even more American resolve to face down the challenge of a ‘rising' China who is constantly threatening to overturn the status quo—time and time again. Just imagine if America walked away from Asia, the thought is too frightening to imagine and the damage to our credibility certainly unfixable. That is why approach proposed by Mr. Glaser should be relegated to what is—fantasy.
