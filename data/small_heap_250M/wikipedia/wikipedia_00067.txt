The 2003–2009 Chinese football match-fixing scandals were revealed by a large-scale 2009–2013 investigation of football betting, bribery and match-fixing (). The scandals were first made public in October 2009. Instead of being led by General Administration of Sport of China or Chinese Football Association like previous investigations, this investigation was led by the Ministry of Public Security. Xie Yalong, Nan Yong and Yang Yimin, who are all former vice presidents of Chinese Football Association, along with Zhang Jianqiang and some other CFA officials were arrested and removed from their posts. Shanghai Shenhua was stripped of their 2003 Chinese Jia-A League title. Lu Jun, the only Chinese referee in the history of FIFA World Cup, and China national football team players Shen Si, Jiang Jin, Qi Hong, Li Ming, were arrested and sentenced to 5.5 years or 6 years in jail.
Background
In the aftermath of the 2001 Chinese football match-fixing scandal, referee Gong Jianping was jailed and died in the prison. Other team managers, referees and officials were not subject to any criminal prosecution. Shandong Luneng Taishan, Shanghai Shenhua and Zhejiang Green Town were fined 800,000 RMB, Jiangsu Sainty and Dalian Shide were fined 500,000 RMB, Qingdao Etsong Hainiu was fined 300,000 RMB. Their club managers were "seriously warned".
In 2006, Liaoshen Evening News report match-fixing event to the Chinese Football Association. Xie Yalong, Nan Yong and Yang Yimin replied "the CFA will carefully study the evidence and quickly request judicial intervention. Please report to us again next time."
Notable affected matches
Shanghai Shenhua vs Shanghai COSCO Sanlin in 2003
It was revealed in 2011 that the referee Lu Jun and CFA official Zhang Jianqiang received bribes totaling 700,000 yuan from Shanghai Shenhua before this Shanghai derby match between the top two teams. In 2013, Shanghai Shenhua was stripped of its 2003 title. Lu Jun, once nicknamed "Golden Whistle" (金哨), was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison for fixing the results of the Shanghai derby and six other league matches.
Shanghai COSCO Sanlin vs Tianjin TEDA in 2003
The CFA stipulated that the result of "the 2002 Jia-A League rank * 0.5 + the 2003 Jia-A League rank" will be used to determine the teams participating the newly created Chinese Super League in 2004. In the final round of the 2003 Jia-A League, Chongqing Lifan would have to lose to Qingdao Etsong Hainiu and hope Shanghai COSCO Sanlin, a title hopeful, could beat (or tie with) Tianjin TEDA. In the match, Chongqing's supporters cheered for the guest team, Qingdao, and Chongqing Lifan successfully lost to Qingdao Etsong Hainiu 1–3. However, Shanghai COSCO Sanlin lost to Tianjin TEDA in a 1–2 blowout. Tianjin TEDA gained the last seat for the inaugural Chinese Super League and Chongqing Lifan was relegated (although Chongqing was eventually able to qualify for the 2004 CSL by merging with Yunnan Hongta). Shanghai International finished one point behind the champions Shanghai Shenhua (in 2013, Shenhua were stripped of the title for bribing Lu Jun in the 9 November derby match).
In 2012, it was found that in 2003, the then vice president of the Chinese Football Association, Nan Yong, did not want Chongqing Lifan to "lose and qualify" and make the CFA rules a laughing stock. With Nan Yong's help, Tianjin TEDA's club manager, Zhang Yifeng, was able to contact Shanghai International and Chinese national football team player Shen Si, who then contacted club and national teammates Jiang Jin, Qi Hong and Li Ming. After Shanghai COSCO Sanlin lost to Tianjin TEDA, the four players received 8 million yuan in total. Shen Si was sentenced to six years in prison, the other three were sentenced to five years and six months in prison.
Guangzhou Pharmaceutical vs Shanxi Wosen Luhu in 2006
Guangzhou Pharmaceutical's team leader Yang Xu bribed Wang Pu, the general manager of Shanxi Wosen Luhu.
Guangzhou Pharmaceutical vs Zhejiang Green Town in 2006
With the help of the former CFA League Department official Fan Guangming, and retired Shandong Luneng player Leng Bo and Xing Rui, Guangzhou Pharmaceutical bribed the players of Zhejiang Green Town, Shen Liuxi and Hu Minghua, with a total amount of 1.5 million yuan.
Qingdao Hailifeng vs Chengdu Blades in 2007
Chengdu Blades general manager Xu Hongtao and deputy general manager You Ke offered Qingdao Hailifeng with 300,000 yuan and free winter training for a month at Chengdu's base, in exchange with Chengdu's victory of the match.
"Chip Shot Gate" of Qingdao Hailifeng in 2009
In a 2009 match against the bottom-of-the-league Sichuan F.C., Qingdao Hailifeng were leading 3–0 with 20 minutes left. But having bet before the match that the total number of goals would be at least four, Qingdao Hailifeng's chairman, Du Yunqi, asked the team for another goal into either net. Due to Sichuan's defensive effort, Qingdao was unable to score another goal. In the last minutes, Qingdao players tried three chip shots into their own goal. However, due to the goalkeeper Mou Pengfei's two saves on his teammates' shots and with the third attempt going wide, the match ended 3–0. The match was known as "Chip Shot Gate (吊射门)" in China. In 2010, CFA revoked Qingdao Helifeng's league registration. In 2012, Du Yunqi was sentenced to seven years in prison.

The Arkansas Negro Boys' Industrial School (1927-1968) was a juvenile correctional facility for black male youth in Arkansas. There were two locations in 1936, one in Jefferson County and one in Wrightsville southeast of Little Rock. A fire in 1959 at the children's dormitory killed twenty-one victims.
Prelude
The NBIS mission was to place children – who would otherwise have been sent to adult prisons – on its working cotton farm, and the first superintendent was Dr. Tandy Washington Coggs. As of March 1959, the Wrightsville school had 69 boys aged between 13 and 17. According to "Negro superintendent of the reform school" L. R. Gaines, "most of the boys in the dormitory were in for minor offenses such as hubcap stealing, or because their parents had split and there was no place for them to go." The boys lived in a 1936 Works Progress Administration building described by Time as "rickety". Governor of Arkansas Orval Faubus (perhaps best known for his role in the Little Rock school segregation fight) visited the school in January 1958, saying "They really need help. They are using some old wood stoves which should be replaced", but Faubus had in fact reduced the budget by $7,100. Graduate student Gordon D. Morgan wrote a report in which he stated, "Many boys go for days with only rags for clothes ... More than half of them wear neither socks nor underwear during [the winter] of 1955-56".
Fire
In the pre-dawn morning of March 5, 1959, a fire was set in the dormitory of the Wrightsville facility. Arthur Ray Poole, aged 16, one of two inmates "sergeants" with minor responsibility, smelled the smoke. Police never investigated to determine who or what may have caused the fire, although many claims have been made. The doors had been locked into the dormitory, and the windows covered with "heavy gauge wire mesh", making escape nearly impossible. It is noted that the equivalent school for white children did not have a protocol of locking their doors. O. F. "Charley" Meadows, a 16-year-old night sergeant, helped in breaking open one window, allowing for egress. 48 boys managed to escape, while 21 burned to death.
Aftermath
The families of the deceased said that authorities told them that 14 of the dead boys were wrapped in newspapers and deposited in an unmarked grave. The gravesite is located at Haven of Rest Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas. There was nothing to denote that the children buried there until 2018 when a plaque was donated to the site. On the 50th anniversary of the fire, some families of the dead held a press conference at the Arkansas State Capitol.
Segregationist Governor of Arkansas Orval Faubus asked a committee to investigate the fire. The committee concluded that the correctional facility, the State of Arkansas, and the local community held responsibility for the incident, but recommended no course of action. A Pulaski County grand jury returned no indictments, but stated:
A KTHV report said that "somehow the story faded into the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement." Frank Lawrence, brother of one of the victims, attempted to make a documentary and brought the fire more widespread attention in the early 21st century.
The land once occupied by the unit now houses the Arkansas Department of Correction Wrightsville Unit. For sixty years, there was no marker or memorial that indicated that the boys school existed or that the fire occurred. On April 25, 2019, a monument to the dead was unveiled at the Wrightsville Unit of the Arkansas Department of Correction.

George Baker (1825–1910) was a British industrialist and Liberal politician and philanthropist. He was born in Birmingham on 11 May 1825, from a long-established Quaker family.
He was educated at the Friends' School, Ackworth, West Yorkshire, but started work at his father's blacking factory aged 15.
Birmingham City Council
He was elected to Birmingham city council in 1869, becoming an Alderman in 1874. In June 1876 he was elected Mayor of Birmingham, on the resignation of Joseph Chamberlain, and was re-elected mayor in November of that year. He continued as astrong supporter of the Liberal Party even when Chamberlain split with the party over Irish home rule.
Ruskin and Bewdley
Baker was a staunch Quaker and a life-long admirer of John Ruskin's Utopian ideals. A prominent member of Ruskin's Guild of St George, he succeeded Ruskin to become the second master of the Guild on Ruskin'd death in 1900.
In 1870 Baker acquired 381 acres of woodland in the Wyre Forest near Bewdley, Worcestershire from a sale of Crown property. He offered 7 acres to Ruskin the following year, increasing his offer to 20 acres in 1877, the year that Ruskin paid his one and only visit to the area.
I have been staying for two days with the good Mayor of Birmingham, and he has shown me St.George's Land, his gift, in the midst of a sweet space of English hill and dale and orchard, yet unhurt by hand of man.
This land, including Atholgarth and St George's Farm, became the nucleus of what is now the Guild's Ruskin Land project.
Between 1875 and 1877 he commissioned the construction of Beaucastle, a major country house in the Arts and Crafts style near Bewdley. The house's architect Richard Doubleday corresponded closely with Ruskin on design and construction of the house. The house features four stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones, thought to have been made in William Morris's factory, although this cannot be verified. He served as mayor of Bewdley in 1888–9.
Death
Baker was twice married. He died on 15 January 1910, and is buried at Birmingham city cemetery, Witton.

Dr. Lucian Smeets was a Belgian stamp forger operating around the early 1900s.
Smeets used a sophisticated method of taking an original stamp with the correct perforations, paper and watermark for the one he wished to forge, fading out the printing and then printing a new design of the desired stamp on the blank.
Among the stamps Smeets is believed to have forged are:
British Solomon Islands Protectorate canoe stamps.
British Victorian stamps.
Nevis.
Serbian stamps of 1901 and 1904.

Ellsworth County (county code EW) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 6,376. Its county seat and most populous city is Ellsworth.
History
Early history
From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America both east and west of the Mississippi River. In 1762, after losing the French and Indian War to Great Britain, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.
It regained the western territory under Napoleon, who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of Saint-Domingue, where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 Haiti declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.
The Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers' emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized; and in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. Ellsworth County was established February 26, 1867. The county was named after the old Fort Ellsworth, named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the American Civil War. On November 17, 1866, the fort was renamed Fort Harker in honor of General Charles Garrison Harker who had died on June 27, 1864, from wounds received in an abortive offensive action in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort's remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.
On March 22, 1869, Fourteen Pawnee Indians, including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops. Though the Pawnees had discharge papers from the army, a fight ensued. The Indians retreated to a sandstone cave, known today as Palmer's Cave. Their attackers set fire to grass at the cave's entrance, and six to nine Pawnees were killed as they ran out. The others died from exposure without their possessions. A few days later, the post surgeon at nearby Fort Harker, in today's town of Kanopolis, removed six heads from their bodies, and shipped them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., for cranial study.
In the later 19th century, this area became known for cattle ranching and cattle drives. Town life was often riotous with cowboys celebrating after long drives.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water. It is intersected by the Smoky Hill River.

History
On 28 October 1382, a chantry to say masses for the dead was established in New Street, Birmingham. As part of the religious settlement of King Henry VIII laws were enacted suppressing all monasteries and chantries. In the case of chantries, little had occurred since the 1545 Act and when King Edward VI came to the throne in 1547, new legislation to close chantries was soon enacted. Part of the process of suppressing chantries involved holding an inquiry into their property and assets. The New Street chantry was abolished in common with thousands of others, although the people of Birmingham were told that the assets would not be seized by the Crown but made available for educational purposes. When the assets still had not been returned to the town, a meeting was held in St Martin's Church, the Bull Ring, Birmingham, to petition the Crown to build a school in New Street on the land formerly occupied by the chantry. This was approved and the following year, King Edward VI School was opened. Owning land in the very centre of Birmingham gave it a secure financial base. In 1883, five new King Edward schools were created to meet the educational needs of the expanding population of the city of Birmingham.
Due to financial difficulties, many of the schools were forced to sell the land of their original location to buy the cheaper land from the surrounding area in the city. Many of the schools have hence changed location since their founding, with only Aston remaining in its original buildings.
In September 2017, the previously independent Handsworth Grammar School joined the foundation, becoming King Edward VI Handsworth Grammar School for Boys.
Foundation Service
Since the expansion of the Foundation in 1883, once per year, year 7 pupils from within each school in the Foundation meet at The Great Hall within the University of Birmingham for a service to commemorate the founding of the King Edward VI Foundation. Historically at this service, pupils read from The Bible, sang hymns, and are told the story of the creation of the Foundation. More recently, pupils engage in musical performances, short plays and reciting poems.

Pheidole megatron (named after Megatron from the toy line Transformers) is a species of ant in the subfamily Myrmicinae.
Habitat and distribution
First described in 2013, Pheidole megatron was found under stones, in and under rotten logs, and nesting and foraging on the ground, occurring in coastal scrub, dry forest and in a coconut plantation, in elevations between 10 and 35 m. It was collected only on the islands of Anjouan, Moheli, and Grand Comoro of the Comoros. On Anjouan it occurs together with two likely relatives, P. decepticon and P. megacephala.
Description
From the former species, P. megatron can be distinguished by a slightly larger and more globular postpetiolar ventral process in the major workers and significantly less abundant standing hairs, which often end bluntly or apically split in both worker subcastes, compared to a slightly smaller, more angulate postpetiolar ventral process and relatively numerous, acute standing hairs in P. decepticon. The major workers of P. megatron tend to have a less heart- and more square-shaped head in full-face view than both P. decepticon and P. megacephala, with a shallower posterior emargination, and some to several longitudinal rugulae on the posterior 2/5 of the face, compared to an often heart-shaped head, with a deeper posterior emargination, and an almost completely smooth and shiny posterior head surface in P. decepticon and P. megacephala major workers. The minor workers of P. megatron have a slightly narrower head and larger eyes than those of P. decepticon and also a narrower head and a slightly shorter postpetiole than the minors of P. megacephala.

The 1971 Mongolian National Championship was the eighth recorded edition of the Mongolian National Championship for football, with the first tournament taking place in 1955 and no tournament held in 1965. It would appear however that championships were contested between 1956 and 1963, as sources note that a team called Aldar, the Mongolian Army Sports Club, won the title on numerous occasions during that time. Nonetheless, the 1971 national championship was won by Tengeriin Bugnuud, a team from Bat-Ölzii, a sum (district) of Övörkhangai Province in southern Mongolia, their third title following their first victory in 1967 championship.

Azkend 2: The World Beneath is a match-3 puzzle video game developed by Finnish studio 10tons Ltd. It is a sequel to Azkend and was released on March 14, 2012 for Microsoft Windows and iOS, on June 7, 2012 for Android, on May 6, 2016 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, and on January 5, 2018 for Nintendo Switch.
It follows Jules, who is an adventurer and gets caught up in a maelstrom, making her become stranded in a mysterious land. The story is told through entries of a journal, retelling her journey. The player's job is to escape one location after another, while using various objects that can be found. The gameplay consists of connecting symbols in a usual match-3 play on hexagonal tiles in overall 60 levels.
Reception
Azkend 2: The World Beneath received "mixed or average" reviews for Switch/Xbox One, and "generally favorable" reviews for its HD iOS version, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.
Gamezebo said "Put simply, match-3 games don't reach higher quality than what you'll find in Azkend 2...Fans of "Bejeweled" and its ilk, and who own an iPhone or iPad, simply cannot miss Azkend 2. It sets the standard for its genre." Pocketgamer said "An entertaining and enjoyable match-three puzzler with an interesting story woven around its parts, Azkend 2 - The World Beneath is sometimes let down by poor design, but it's still well worth checking out." TouchArcade said "It's hard to recommend Azkend 2 in its current state. The board layouts are too frustrating, and the game never opens up enough to make the struggle worthwhile. It's a simple problem in a game that would otherwise be excellent, but it's also an insidious one." Appspy said "Certainly aimed towards casual players, Azkend 2 combines an interesting spin on match three gameplay with an adventurous tale." SlideToPlay said "Azkend 2 is a surprise on every level, combining puzzles and a great story for a memorable adventure." AppSmile wrote "Infused with a fun storyline and collectible power-ups, Azkend 2 is not your ordinary Match-3 title." 148apps said "The original Azkend was a twist and eye candy, but it was pretty easy to beat. Azkend 2 goes deeper. It's still a casual game, but the difficulty level increases much more dramatically even if it's so incremental it's hard to notice."

Theresa Garnett (17 May 1888 – 24 May 1966) was a British suffragette. She was a serial protester who sometimes went by the name 'Annie O'Sullivan', was jailed and then still refused to cooperate. She assaulted Winston Churchill while carrying a whip. She retired from her militancy after the suffragette movement decided to commit arson as part of its protests. She was a honorary editor of a women's right's magazine in 1960.
Early life
Theresa Garnett was born in Leeds in 1888, daughter to Joshua Garnett and Frances Theresa Garnett who died when baby Theresa was 21 days old of "puerperal mania" (postpartum psychosis) in the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum near Wakefield. Garnett was brought up by her paternal grandparents, educated at a convent school, and later worked for some time as a pupil-teacher.
Suffragette activity
In 1907, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) after being inspired by a speech given by Adela Pankhurst. In April 1909, she sparked some interest by running about with a whistle before chaining herself, along with four other activists, including Bertha Quinn, Margery Humes and Sylvia Russell to one of the male dignitaries' statues in the Central Lobby of the Houses of Parliament to protest against a law forbidding precisely this kind of thing - disorderly conduct within the Palace of Westminster when the Parliament was in session. They were not charged.
In June 1909, Garnett and Lillian Dove Willcox were arrested during another attempt to "rush" the House of Commons and convicted of assaulting a warder whilst in Holloway Prison and were given another ten-day sentence.
On 7 November 1909 she was invited to Eagle House at Batheaston in Somerset. Eagle House was known as "Suffragette's Rest" because of its support for the movement. It was the home of fellow suffragettes Mary Blathwayt and Emily, her mother. Emily had decided to plant a tree to commemorate every woman who went to prison for the cause. These trees came to be known as "Annie's Arboretum" after Annie Kenney, the local organiser. Garnett planted a Taxus baccata Elegantissima, and a lead plaque was installed to record the event. Emily's husband was a keen photographer and recorded the event.
The following week, on 14 November 1909, Garnett assaulted Winston Churchill at the Bristol Temple Meads railway station with a dogwhip, cutting him in the face. Arrested, she was sentenced to a month in prison at the HM Prison Bristol for disturbing the peace (Churchill did not press charges for the assault itself). She went on a hunger strike, was force-fed, tried to set her cell on fire, and finished her time in hospital. She received for her actions, from the WSPU, a brooch for her imprisonment and the Hunger Strike Medal for "Valour" in the hunger strike. In 1910, she became organiser for the WSPU in Camberwell, but left the Union after some disagreement about the WPSU's arson campaign.
World War I

Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court ruled that the use of a confession obtained through rigorous interrogation methods by Law Enforcement violates the Fourteenth Amendment.
In his concurrence/dissent, Justice Robert Jackson famously opined, "To bring in a lawyer means a real peril to solution of the crime because, under our adversary system, he deems that his sole duty is to protect his client—guilty or innocent—and that, in such a capacity, he owes no duty whatever to help society solve its crime problem. Under this conception of criminal procedure, any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances."
In this case, a defendant was subjected to rigorous interrogation methods, including being forced to sleep on the floor, resulting in a confession to having committed murder. The Supreme Court ruled that the confession was involuntary and reversed his conviction.
Thurgood Marshall represented the defendant, Robert A. Watts, in Watts v. Indiana.

Nova Siri is a town and comune in the province of Matera, in the Southern Italian region of Basilicata. Nova Siri is close to the site of the ancient Ionian colony of Siris. Nova Siri is formed by two small towns: the old, historic Nova Siri Centre ('paese') and the coastal town developed from the 1970s - Nova Siri Station ('Scalo'). The centre is sited on a hill at above sea level about from the sea.
The main church and the castle are of medieval origin. The Monte Pollino National Park is located nearby.
Nova Siri is a popular holiday and tourist destination, thanks to its sandy coast characterized by coastal dunes. Nova Siri is reached via the SS 106 National road and by train.
The population is around 6,800, with the majority being in the newer, seaside town of Nova Siri Scalo.
History
The history of Nova Siri starts during the Byzantine rule of southern Italy, when it was used as a military fortress. The old name “Bollita” comes from porcini mushrooms and the current name was replaced on the council's request to recall its origins as a Greek territory.
It remained almost deserted after World War I and few people were able to deal with the agricultural work required in the fields.
Nova Siri experienced a demographics growth in the 1970s. Some scenes from the movies Basilicata Coast to Coast by Rocco Papelo and Three Brothers by Francesco Rosi were filmed there.
Economy
Economical resources include summer tourism, wine production and local cuisine.
Festivals
Events in the town include the Sagra d'ricchitell and the Notte dei briganti ("Night of the Bandits"). The latter is a historical reenactment that consists of a performance of scenes from the war between bandits and peasants and scenes from the daily life of the late 19th century.

The Louisville Ridge, also known as the Louisville Seamount Chain, is an underwater chain of over 70 seamounts located in the Southwest portion of the Pacific Ocean. As one of the longest seamount chains on Earth it stretches some from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge northwest to the Tonga-Kermadec Trench, where it subducts under the Indo-Australian Plate as part of the Pacific Plate. The chain may have been formed by movement of the Pacific Plate over the Louisville hotspot or by leakage of magma from the shallow mantle up through the Eltanin fracture zone, which it follows closely.
Depth-sounding data first revealed the existence of the seamount chain in 1972.
Seamounts
The Louisville Ridge includes the following:

Currituck Seamount
Danseur Seamount

Şaka (10+1) (commonly known simply as Şaka and 10+1), is the fourth studio album by Turkish girl group Hepsi, expected to be released in May 2008. The album is the group's third album so far, and is the follow-up from their 2006 album Hepsi 2, which spawned the hit singles "Kalpsizsin" and "Aşk Sakızı".
Album title
The album's title Şaka (10+1) in English means "Joke (10+1)". The "(10+1)" section of the title refers to the fact that the album consists of 11 tracks, 10 of which are famous covers, with an addition of 1 new track. The group entitled the album Joke, as all the cover songs were written by the previous artist with deep meaningful reason; however, the group stated that the tracks were songs that they grew up listening to as a child, so the same meaning of the song isn't intended and isn't to be taken so seriously.
The group's debut album was entitled Bir, translating to "One", and their previous album was named Hepsi 2, which made fans speculate that the new album would be entitled Hepsi 3 or Üç. In binary, "10+1" can be interpreted as 3.
History
The album was initially was supposed to be released in the summer of 2007, however the album was not released and no information regarding the album was given. In November 2007 Hepsi confirmed in an interview with the press that they were in the process of picking songs to record, and were going to begin recording the tracks at the end of December 2007.
Style
Şaka (10+1) is noticeably different from other albums released from the group; this is due to it mostly consisting of cover songs. The group's first album Bir was mostly praised for the up-tempo songs which featured on the album whereas their second album was praised for the lyrics. However, with most of the songs on Şaka (10+1) being covers, the album is noticeably more vocally challenged than the other releases. The vocals are more diverse and vocal roles are shared more equally than the previous releases. The album, however, isn't dull and an imitation of the previous artists efforts, but is revived not only by vocals, but with add new up-tempo beats. This adds a sense of edge to the album, especially as the album features rap vocals from group member Eren, which fits right into the songs. In an interview with the Turkish music magazine Blue Jean, band leader Gülçin said their style went more pop with the addition of rock and electronic music elements, unlike their first two albums Bir and Hepsi 2, since they are more influenced from R&B and dance-pop.
Promotion
On May 24, 2008 at 20:30 (GMT+2), Group Hepsi will hold a concert at "Turkcell kuruçeşme arena", to perform the new album to fans for the first time.
On May 16, 2008, the group feature on Tatlises Radyo to promote their new album. The show was the first time the public heard previews of the new songs. They also stated that they were going to hold concerts at several cities. One of which was Ankara where they will perform on June 8.
On May 26, 2008 Hepsi appeared on "Duru Muhabbetler" talkshow were they performed several songs from the album including "Hep Bana", "Tavla" and "Aşk Herşeyi Affeder Mi?" At the talkshow Hepsi announced that they will be releasing "Hepsi" stationary, "Hepsi" bags and "Hepsi" T-shirts.
Tracks
The album consists of 11 tracks, 10 cover songs and 1 new song. This confirms that the two tracks Hepsi recorded for the Winx Club movie soundtrack, "Sen Bir Tanesin" and "Sadece Bir Kiz", won't feature on the album as the only original song to feature on the album has been confirmed to be "4 Peynirli Pizza". The album originally wasn't going to contain any new material, however whilst recording the cover songs Kenan Dogulu had written a new song and offered it to the group. The group accepted the offer and as of May 12, 2008 the music video for "4 Peynirli Pizza" has been recorded.

The International Mercantile Marine Officers' Association (IMMOA) was a global union federation bringing together trade unions representing officers in merchant navies.
History
The federation was established on 16 June 1925, at a meeting attended by representatives of unions from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United States. It set up headquarters in Antwerp, and successfully negotiated representation on the Joint Maritime Commission of the International Labour Organization. From the start, it also represented navigators, engineers, and ships' doctors, and the International Federation of Radio Officers soon affiliated to the federation.
Omer Becu became the union's secretary in 1932. In 1940, he escaped to London, moving the IMMOA's headquarters there. The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) had also evacuated to London, and it began working closely with the IMMOA. Becu was seconded to ITF work, and the British Navigators' and Engineering Officers' Union took over the leadership of the federation.
By 1946, the federation had decided to fully integrate with the ITF. It recommended that all its affiliates join the ITF, and refocused its activity on promoting friendship and co-operation among ships' officers. It undertook little activity, holding a conference in 1948, and the penultimate meeting of its board of directors in 1951, but remained in existence.
In 1964, the federation held one final directors' meeting, recommending that the organisation be wound up, and this was agreed at a final congress, held the following year. The IMMOA's assets were transferred to the ITF's Edo Fimmen Free Trade Union Fund.

Hans Rudolph, the founder, moved to the Kansas City metropolitan area in 1941, and in 1955, began a partnership with Glade Ives to work on various pieces of equipment and to design new respiratory devices and parts. In 1955, the partnership ended and Rudolph started a machine shop in his basement, where he manufactured his high velocity valve. He produced other items in his shop.
In 1960, Hans and his son, John H. Rudolph incorporated the company under its present name and moved it to a much larger location, at 7200 Wyandotte, in Kansas City, Missouri. The company stayed there forty-six years. Hans and John worked on new equipment and improvements on existing equipment. They began designing continuous positive airway (CPAP) masks in the early 1980s. Hans' grandsons Kevin, Kelly and John later joined the company. They helped with equipment design and took leadership roles in the company. Hans died in 1994 and the first CPAP and bilevel PAP masks went into production only a few years earlier.
Current status of the company
After founder Hans Rudolph died, his son John H. Rudolph headed Hans Rudolph, Inc., for a number of years. Hans' grandsons John, Kevin and Kelly managed the company when John H. retired from day-to-day company involvement. Since Hans died, the company has expanded its product line. In October 2007, the company was moved into a new building, its current location, in the Shawnee Mission area of Johnson County, Kansas. Johnson County is a well-to-do suburban county in the Kansas City metropolitan area.
For a number of years, Hans Rudolph, Inc., has produced devices and parts for CPAP/bilevel PAP equipment, PFT parts and devices, ventilator parts and equipment and anesthesia products. The company is well known in the respiratory and sleep medicine fields for its CPAP and bilevel PAP masks. The 7600 V2 full-face mask has since 2007 been well known. The company advertises its products in various respiratory and sleep medicine publications. Various suppliers carry the 7600 V2 mask. These include online companies, such as TheCPAPShop.com, DirectHomeMedical.com, CPAP Xchange.com, CPAP Supply USA, Medical Department Store.;

Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) is a procedure by which the safety of a welded structure with defects or flaws can be determined. ECAs utilize the material properties and expected stress history to determine a flaw acceptance criteria which will ensure that welds will not fail during the construction or service life of the welded structure. The assessment can be used before the structure is in use, or during in-service inspection, to determine whether a given weld is in need of repair. ECAs are used throughout the energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure industries. ECAs are based heavily upon fracture mechanics principles, and reflect an improvement over traditional methods of weld quality assurance, which can be arbitrary or overly conservative.
Background
During welding, defects or flaws can develop. In some cases, these flaws could potentially affect the integrity of the weld, resulting in failure by fatigue, creep, brittle fracture, or yielding. Therefore, codes to determine weld quality must be developed. Traditionally, welding codes have been based on workmanship criteria. These criteria are determined empirically, typically by estimating the level of weld quality expected from a skilled welder. While these criteria have been reliable historically, improvements made in welding technology and materials science are not taken into account. As a result, over time, workmanship criteria have become increasingly conservative. This conservatism results in unnecessary repairs, which can increase construction costs and can yield undesirable residual stresses at the location of the repair weld.
Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, engineering critical assessments began to emerge as an alternative to traditional workmanship criteria. These ECAs relied heavily on recent developments in the field of fracture mechanics. Where workmanship criteria were developed with a limited understanding of material characteristics, and considered only the length of a given weld flaw, these ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria considered additional factors such as:
The stress history of the weld, including all cyclic and static stresses expected throughout the life cycle of the welded structure
The strength of the base metal and weld material
The fracture toughness (measured via Crack tip opening displacement testing or Charpy impact testing) of the base metal and the weld material
The flaw orientation (e.g., measurement of flaw length and flaw height, as opposed to flaw length only)
Together, these additional factors allow for more generous flaw acceptance criteria, resulting in fewer unnecessarily repaired welds.
To comply with the flaw acceptance criteria developed during ECA, non-destructive examination must be utilized. Ultrasonic testing is typically used due to its high accuracy, ability to identify flaw size and orientation, and its ability to provide feedback instantly.
ECA for oil and gas pipelines
ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, particularly with regard to qualification of girth welds on cross-country oil and gas transmission pipelines. This is because girth welds are typically uniform from weld to weld, allowing construction contractors to utilize mechanized welding. Mechanized welding increases productivity over manual welding techniques by allowing for better, more uniform control over weld characteristics. ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are able to take advantage of the high strength and toughness of the welds produced to develop more generous flaw acceptance criteria. In addition, the flaws created during mechanized welding are typically oriented differently than flaws developed from manual welding. ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria more effectively assess these flaws, by considering flaw orientation, rather than just flaw length.
Standards
Several standards specific to ECAs for oil and gas pipelines have been developed. The most commonly used of these are API 1104 Appendix A, API 579, CSA Z662 Annex K, and BS 7910. The standard used depends primarily on the location of the pipeline being installed. The standards differ in methodology and in extreme cases, can result in significantly different flaw acceptance criteria. However, for typical operating conditions, the criteria are easy enough to follow that practical differences between the standards are small.

American football in North Central Pennsylvania has a historic past. Football is the predominant sport in the region of Pennsylvania dating back to the early days of the sport. All levels of football, including high school football and college football, are followed passionately. North Central Pennsylvania does not have any professional football franchises.
History
Early years (1870–1944)
American football was first originated in the area in the late 1870s, when Pennsylvania State University and Bucknell University created programs. The first local recorded game occurred on November 12, 1881, when Penn State traveled to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to play Bucknell, known until 1886 as the University of Lewisburg. Penn State won 9–0, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of "American rugby." Less than a year after this game some high Schools in the area adopted the game. The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the "scrimmage", the "first down" and the "gridiron" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the Mirror (University of Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Most high school games were not recorded so a specific date on when high school football actually originated in the area.
With the creation of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association in 1913 and other high school sport governing bodies being founded more specific records and rules were being brought about between the years 1897 and 1920. The earliest recorded high school football game in the area took place in 1883 however the exact date was not found nor the schools involved as the box school only said "Green and Black" not school names, nicknames or mascots.
Massive growth (1945–1990)
The sport in the area saw massive growth after World War II. During the next 40 years after the war, high schools and colleges saw a massive spike in participation and fan support. Mostly due to the increased presence of media and state playoffs. The playoff bracket and post-season games drew large numbers of fans and supporters. During the 60s, 70s and 80s the sport saw the most growth in the area. Most schools, even small rural schools had a football program.
During this time period is when most of the area's schools' rivalries came to fruition.
Modern years (1991–present)
After the massive growth of the sport, football has continued its success in this region. Fans have continued to support their local schools or colleges in the area with a passion. Even though there is no professional franchise in the area many people root for either the Philadelphia Eagles or Pittsburgh Steelers.
Collegiate level football
The following chart shows area colleges football programs.
High school level football
Of the 102 public high schools in the area 101 have football programs (as of June 2017). Games are played on Fridays, however some games are played on Saturday possibly due to travel or other inconveniences. Programs play a total of eleven regular season games heading into playoffs. A possible four more games leading up to the state championship games now played at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The location was chosen due to its centralized location within the state.
Notable players
Many notable American football players were born and grew up in the North Central Pennsylvania region.

A gravity racer or soapbox is a motorless vehicle which is raced on a downhill road either against the clock or against another competitor. Although most are built for the purpose of recreation, some gravity racing teams take the sport more seriously and compete to win. They are propelled by gravity and can achieve speeds upwards of 164 km/h (101 mph).
Soapbox cars
Originally, gravity racer cars were built from wooden soap (or apple) crates and rollerskate wheels, but have grown more sophisticated over time, with materials like aluminium, fiberglass and even CFRP being used.
In the United Kingdom a gravity racer car has been called a buggy, trolley, cart. It is currently popularly called a soapbox. In Scotland and northern England it has also been called a bogie, cartie/cairtie, guider or piler. In Wales it is often referred to as a gambo. In Australia they are called billy-carts, and in Brazil it is known as rolimã.
In addition to being built by children, there are organised competitions and races ("soapbox or billycart derby") that often engage the enthusiasm of adults. However, these are usually entered into in a spirit of fun rather than serious competition. Often they will be fund-raisers for charity. Many, but not all, events impose the following rules:
The car must have no motor
The car must have at least 4 wheels
The car may have to have some type of brakes
The driver must wear a helmet
A push at the top is allowed for speed
Soapbox cars weigh an average of and reach top speeds of . Many cities have permanent tracks where drivers compete for prizes.
Construction
A typical gravity racer cart is usually made of steel, and has 4 wheels, arranged as a fixed rear axle, and a steerable front beam axle - usually with a very simple single central pivot. A seat is arranged at the back, and perhaps the seat area is enclosed, as in the original soap-box design. More sophisticated designs might employ a fully enclosed body. The types of wheels employed vary according to what can be obtained easily - wheels from baby carriages, pushchairs, prams, and discarded bicycles being common. Ready-made wheels are also available from hardware suppliers. Steering is typically actuated using a rope connected to the ends of the steerable beam (which can then double as a useful manual pulling device).
More sophisticated steering methods are sometimes seen. Brakes are also commonly used, and most soap-box cart racing contests require these. Often a simple friction brake operated by a lever which bears on one of the tyres is all that is required under the rules.
Gravity racer carts are unpowered, and are either pushed by willing helpers, or are run down a suitable slope. Races will usually take place downhill and the most efficient and skillfully driven cart will win - gravity applying equally to all.
Gravity racer carts also make great construction projects for children, requiring only an intuitive sense of engineering, and a few basic construction skills. There are also predesigned kits available, though for many this defeats the purpose of the exercise.
Recently, more advanced gravity racers are beginning to emerge. These, intended for competition in the major soapbox races, are sometimes made of carbon fibre and feature a monocoque design, although most use a more traditional chassis or spaceframe design with bodywork made from materials such as plywood, corrugated plastic or similar. Examples of such soapboxes include the Lotus 119c and the Formula Gravity VXR Nimbus.
In Australia billy carts tend to conform, even in the 21st century, to a more traditional or rudimentary specification often being constructed informally by juveniles from found or inexpensive materials with minimal adult input and used without safety equipment. However even when construction of vehicles is more formally organised, such as for the annual Blacktown and District Cub Scout Billy Cart Derby at Rooty Hill, NSW the vehicle is still constructed to a deliberately relatively unsophisticated design, although safety is a consideration.
In Indonesia, billy carts are also known as 'gokar'. They are raced in different regions as a community social activity. The form of the cart is similar to the Australian one. However, the wheels are often motorcycle wheel bearings.
In Brazil, gravity racers are known as "carrinhos de rolimã." Traditional designs are very minimalistic, with an open board-like body and wheels made up of naked ball bearings (no tyres allowed), usually discarded parts obtained from auto mechanics.
Electric soapboxes are a new development and are not, in fact, pure gravity racers since they are electrically powered.
History of gravity racer races
The first recorded gravity race took place in 1904 in Oberursel (Taunus) near Frankfurt, Germany. It was inspired by major motor sports events like the Gordon Bennett Cup and the Kaiserpreis race.
In 1933, Dayton Daily News newspaper photographer Myron Scott of Dayton, Ohio had covered a race of boy-built cars in his home community and was so taken with the idea that he acquired rights to the event; the national-scale Soap Box Derby grew out of this idea. In 1934, Scott had managed to persuade fifty cities across the United States to hold soap box car races and send a champion each to Dayton for a major race, later held in Akron. Scott later went on to work for Chevrolet.
In the UK, gravity racer derbies have recently become more popular, brought to the masses by large events such as the Red Bull Soapbox Race and that held between 2000 and 2004 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Now, many small hilly communities organize their own races, such as the Catterline Cartie Challenge in Scotland and the Belchford Downhill Challenge in Lincolnshire, and there are now several dozen known races across the UK. An annual Soap Box Derby has taken place in mid-July at Richard's Castle on the Shropshire/Herefordshire border since 2004. In addition to the local community races, there are a small number of races which attract more serious competitors, such as Cairngorm Soapbox Extreme (held at Cairn Gorm from 2009 to 2012) and the Worlaby Downhill Challenge. These races tend to produce higher speeds than the community races. Gravity racers taking part in Cairngorm Soapbox Extreme in 2011 reached speeds of 70 mph.
Physics considerations
A gravity racer obtains its energy solely from the force of gravity (assuming no starting push is permitted), which is effectively equal for any combination of racer design and course. However, performance can be greatly affected by the combined effects of various forms of drag and also the moment of inertia of the wheels, and also of course by the skill of the driver in choosing optimal lines. Drag breaks down into aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. The latter can be minimised by careful attention to the wheel bearings, tyre sizes and pressures, and brakes (to avoid parasitic brake drag). High tyre pressures and narrower tyres will typically lower the tyre contact rolling resistance, usually at the expense of grip. Larger wheels have lower rolling resistance than small ones, and rolling resistance is also proportional to overall weight. If permitted, a 3-wheeler design will have 25% less rotational inertia than a 4-wheeler, all else being equal. Aerodynamic drag can be minimised by designing a fully enclosed body that reduces the drag coefficient, but given that this can be a highly technical thing to achieve especially for the amateur builder, and given that some aerodynamic drag is inevitable, a heavier cart will always do better than a lighter one with the same drag coefficient - its terminal velocity will be higher. For this reason there are usually class weight limits in most controlled forms of the sport. Since some of the potential energy due to gravity must be converted to the kinetic energy of the rotating wheels, a vehicle with lighter wheels will accelerate faster than one with heavier wheels. If a race is started on some form of ramp, having a tail-heavy car can also improve final acceleration, as the effective height of the centre of gravity of the vehicle is raised.

Radoslav "Rasho" Nesterović (, ; born May 30, 1976) is a Slovenian former professional basketball player. He holds citizenship in both Slovenia and Greece. During his career in the NBA, Nesterović played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, San Antonio Spurs, Indiana Pacers, and Toronto Raptors. He retired in 2011.
Playing career
Early life and career in Europe
Nesterović was born in Ljubljana, SR Slovenia, SFR Yugoslavia to father Čedo, a Bosnian Serb employee of the Slovenian Railways, and a mother Branka, a midwife in the Ljubljana University Medical Centre. He started playing basketball with the KD Slovan youth team. Later, he played with the junior club of KK Partizan and made his debut during the 1992–93 season.
PAOK
During the Yugoslav wars, Nesterović moved to PAOK of the Greek League. While playing there, he obtained a second citizenship (Greek) to avoid EU restrictions. To obtain Greek citizenship he had to administratively change his name in the eyes of Greek law. While in Greece and other EU countries, he thus competed as a domestic player under the name Radoslav "Rasho" Makris.
Olimpija Ljubljana
Ahead of the 1995–96 season, Nesterović returned to his hometown to play for Union Olimpija. Competing in the Slovenian domestic league, his averages were 30 minutes, 17 points and 14 rebounds per game. The summer of 1996 off season brought another significant feat for Nesterović; while playing for Slovenia's youth national team he was named the MVP at the 1996 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. The next season, 1996–97, he was part of that legendary Olimpija team that reached the 1997 EuroLeague Final Four in Rome. In that season, he played an average of 17.0 minutes per game, averaging 8.0 points, and 4.3 rebounds per game in the EuroLeague.
Virtus Bologna
The exposure on the biggest European stage led to a big time move for Nesterović to the Italian League power Virtus (Kinder) Bologna during the summer of 1997. In the first season with his new club, he scored an average of 8 points and grabbed an average of 6 rebounds per game, in the Italian domestic league. In the EuroLeague, he scored 6.5 points and grabbed 6.0 rebounds per game. He helped Virtus win the EuroLeague title, playing alongside legendary players such as Sasha Danilović, Zoran Savić, and Antoine Rigaudeau. In the EuroLeague Final, Nesterović scored 6 points and grabbed 9 rebounds.
NBA debut: Minnesota Timberwolves
Nesterović was a first-round draft pick (17th overall) of the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1998 NBA Draft. He joined the Timberwolves just before the end of the 1998–99 season and played there through the 2002–03 season.
Nesterović stayed in Minnesota for four full seasons because he played only the last two regular-season games, plus all of his team's games in the playoffs, in his first season. His best season with the Timberwolves was 2002–03, when he averaged 11.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game, earning himself a 6-year contract with the San Antonio Spurs in 2004. Although the Timberwolves were offering him a contract worth $12 million more, Nesterović opted for the move to Texas for a shot at the NBA title.
San Antonio Spurs
In his first season with San Antonio, Nesterović scored 8.7 points per game and grabbed 7.7 rebounds per game. In his second season with the Spurs, 2004–05, he suffered an ankle injury, and was limited to 70 games. Nevertheless, he remained the starting center for the majority of the season, and, along with his colleague from the Slovenian national basketball team, Beno Udrih, he ultimately won an NBA title with the Spurs that year.
Toronto Raptors
On June 21, 2006, Nesterović was traded to the Toronto Raptors along with cash in exchange for Matt Bonner, Eric Williams and a second round pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. In his first season with the Raptors, he averaged 6.2 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.0 blocks per game.
On April 2, 2008, at 7:34 pm EST, Nesterović hit his first three-point shot ever in the regular season, with a pump fake, for a buzzer beater against the Atlanta Hawks, in Atlanta.
While playing for the Raptors, he was nicknamed Nestea as the fans found it "refreshing to have a true center."
Indiana Pacers
On July 9, 2008, Nesterović was traded along with the Raptors' T.J. Ford, Maceo Baston and the 17th pick in the draft (Roy Hibbert) to the Indiana Pacers, in exchange for Jermaine O'Neal and the 41st pick in the draft (Nathan Jawai).
Return to the Toronto Raptors
On July 30, 2009, Nesterović officially was signed by the Raptors, reportedly with the biannual exception of $1.9 million for one season.
Return to Europe: Olympiacos
For the 2010–11 season Nesterović returned to Europe, when he signed a two-year contract with the Greek League powerhouse Olympiacos. He was released by Olympiacos in July 2011.
National team career
Nesterović was the captain of the senior men's Slovenian national basketball team until his retirement from the national team in 2008. He helped his national team finish in 6th place at the EuroBasket 2005 in Belgrade, and to thus secure a place at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. At the EuroBasket 2005, he played an average of 21.7 minutes, scored an average of 6 points, and grabbed an average of 6.2 rebounds per game.
Post-playing career
Since 2014, Nesterović holds a position as a Secretary-General of the Basketball Federation of Slovenia. In 2015, he was elected a member of the FIBA commission of players.
Personal life
Nesterović has a sister and five children. He is the godfather to Luka Dončić, the third pick of the 2018 NBA draft. He speaks Serbian, Slovenian, Italian, Greek, and English.

The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) was an executive agency of the UK Department for Transport (DfT).
DSA promoted road safety in Great Britain by improving driving and motorcycling standards. It set standards for education and training, as well as carrying out theory and practical driving and riding tests.
The responsibilities of DSA only covered Great Britain. In Northern Ireland the same role was carried out by the Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA).
It was announced on 20 June 2013 that DSA would merge with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency into a single agency in 2014. The name of the new agency was confirmed as the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) on 28 November 2013. The DSA was abolished on 31 March 2014, and the DVSA took over its responsibilities on 1 April 2014.
Profile
The DSA was a national organisation with headquarters in Nottingham, training and learning materials centre at Cardington in Bedfordshire and administrative centres in Cardiff and Newcastle.
DSA employed around 2,400 staff around Great Britain and ran tests from around 400 practical driving test centres. Theory tests were carried out at around 150 theory test centres.
DSA was a Trading Fund with a turnover of over £184 million in 2009-10 mainly funded through fees and revenue from other road safety initiatives.
Aims and objectives
The DSA's mission and primary aim was to continually promote road safety by influencing driver and rider behaviour, which it did through:
setting the standards for pre-driver education and driver trainers
registering and supervising quality assured Approved Driving Instructors
carrying out theory and practical driving and riding tests
quality assurance of all testing activity
investigating cases of suspected theory test and practical test impersonations and identity fraud
developing the future education and testing environment through its Learning to Drive programme
Resources
The DSA employed 1,789 practical driving examiners, and 728 administrative staff and managers. It planned to employ a total of 2,769 staff by March 2011, dependent on trading and the government freeze on recruitment.
Board structure
The chief executive was accountable to the Secretary of State for ensuring that the DSA met its obligations and delivered its targets and services. The chief executive had overall responsibility for the DSA's activities, ensuring it met its financial obligations, and providing assurance of a sound system of internal control. The Director General of Motoring and Freight Services was the additional accounting officer.
The chief executive was supported by an executive board, including two non-executive directors. The executive board's role was to provide support and advice, and met monthly.
A separate audit and risk management committee, comprising non-executive directors, acted independently of the executive board to provide assurance to the chief executive on financial and non-financial matters, including corporate governance and risk management.
The change board, attended by the chief executive and appropriate directors, oversaw the development and effective management of the DSA's investment plan of change projects and programmes, and met monthly.
The operational performance group, which also met monthly, was chaired by the operations director and attended by senior managers, and monitored performance against targets and business plan objectives.
Theory and practical driving tests
Before learning to drive a car, moped or motorcycle, a provisional driving licence must be obtained. If a driver already holds a valid full driving licence but wishes to drive larger vehicles, minibuses or buses, provisional entitlement for these categories of vehicle is required.
For those holding a provisional licence, taking the theory test is the next step before acquiring a full licence. For cars and motorcycles candidates are asked 50 questions in 57 minutes and the pass mark is 43 out of 50. For lorries and buses, there are 100 questions in 115 minutes and the pass mark is 85 out of 100.
The hazard perception test is the second part of the driving theory test. Both parts must be passed in order to pass the theory test. If successful, one can then apply to take the practical driving test.
The practical test starts with an eyesight check and some vehicle safety questions. The driving part of the test lasts about 40 minutes, and involves performing some specific manoeuvres as well as demonstrating an overall safe standard of driving. A candidate may make up to 15 minor driving faults but still pass the test (16 or more results in failure). However, if one serious or dangerous fault is committed, then the test is failed. The current pass rate for car 'L' tests is 43%.
The cost of the theory test is now £31, and the practical car test is £62 if taken on weekdays or £75 if taken at weekends or weekday evenings.
To help candidates fully prepare for their theory and practical driving and motorcycle tests, The Stationery Office (TSO), DSA's official publishing partner, produces a range of best-selling official publications. These include The Official DSA Theory Test for Car Drivers (available as a book, CD-ROM or interactive download), The Official DSA Complete Theory Test Kit (CD-ROM and DVD pack) and The Official DSA Guide to Driving – the essential skills (available as a book or downloadable PDF). The full range of titles is available from The Stationery Office online bookshop.
Driving test fees
The last increases prior to July 2005 were:
Practical car and motorcycling test: 2002
Lorry and bus tests: 2001
Driving instructor test: 1997

Driving instructor registration
The DSA held a register of Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) in Great Britain. The ADI Registrar also issues trainee licences to give instruction. In order to qualify as an ADI, three tests must be passed:
theory (part one) - a multiple choice section and a video-based hazard perception section;
driving ability (part two) - an eyesight test followed by a practical test of driving technique;
instructional ability (part three) - a practical test of the ability to instruct.
All three parts of the examination must be passed in this order, and must be completed within two years of passing the theory test (part one).
After being entered on the ADI register, ADIs are free to give driving instruction for money or monies worth, either working for
a driving school or being self-employed. It is a condition of remaining on the register that all ADIs undergo a periodic "test of continued ability of fitness to give instruction" also known as the 'check test'. The passage of the Road Safety Act 2006 empowered DSA to set the standards on all paid tuition, not just that of motor cars as was previously the case.
The DSA required people who applied to register as a Potential Driving Instructor (PDI), as well as existing ADIs who applied to extend their registration or re-register, to have a criminal record check. DSA used the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) to obtain criminal record checks of people in England and Wales, and Disclosure Scotland for people in Scotland.
Some ADIs choose to take additional qualifications so that they can train drivers of large goods vehicles, or fleet drivers. The DSA also held a voluntary register for fleet drivers, Compulsory Basic Trainers (for motorcycles), Large Goods Vehicle instructors and the Register of post-test motorcycle trainers. These registers provided quality standards for the relevant discipline, but were not necessary for paid tuition.
'Learning to Drive' programme
Following consultation, Ministers decided to proceed with a programme of measures, based on education and incentivisation, to strengthen the way that people learn to drive and are tested, and encourage a
culture of lifelong learning.
DSA planned a phased implementation programme, supporting progressive improvements whilst avoiding disruption to those currently learning to drive.
Early improvements were:
continued roll out across Great Britain of the new pre-driver qualification in safe road use
introduction from October 2009 of:
a partial credit towards the theory test for car drivers for those students awarded the new pre-driver qualification in the form of an abridged theory test
case studies into the theory test for car drivers and moped and motorcycle riders to better assess whether learners have understood driving or riding theory
the launch in 2009/10 of a trial to assess the effectiveness of the proposed new learning to drive syllabus and process
introduction from October 2010 of a requirement for the supervising driver to accompany the candidate during a practical car test
subject to the outcome of the trialling, from October 2010 the introduction into all DSA practical tests for learner drivers of an assessment of competence whilst the candidate is driving independently.
Websites
DSA moved its information about learning to drive and ride to Directgov and its information for businesses to Business Link. This was part of the Transformational Government strategy. Its corporate information, which included how the agency was run, consultations, and press releases, was moved to the Department for Transport website.
All DSA's information about learning to drive and ride and for businesses moved to the single government website GOV.UK on 17 October 2012.
DSA became one of the first central government organisations to move its corporate and policy content onto the GOV.UK website on 15 November 2012.
Social media
DSA announced the launch of its own video sharing channel on YouTube on 22 September 2009. The channel – youtube.com/dsagov – was used to post road safety videos which offer advice to test candidates and other road users.
The DSA also operated a Twitter channel - twitter.com/dsagovuk and a Facebook page - facebook.com/dsagovuk.

Anne Mary Celestine Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith (; 14 November 1916 – 19 August 1998) was a British code breaker who became the Countess of Oxford and Asquith upon her marriage in 1947 to Julian Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith.
Life
She was born in Paris in 1916. Her parents were Mary (née de Vere Studd) and Michael Palairet, who was a career diplomat. She was brought up in the Catholic faith in Japan, China and Bucharest, where she would help her father by decoding messages that had been sent to him. In Japan, she survived an earthquake when she was six and later, her family was present during the Chinese civil war. She had an affection for Bucharest, where she took the baccalaureate and learnt French.
She continued her studies in Paris before studying at St Anne's College, Oxford, although she did not take her finals. At college, she met Julian Asquith, who was already the Earl of Oxford and Asquith. They were to marry years later.
During World War II, she worked at the code breaking centre of Bletchley Park, exploiting her knowledge of linguistics and codes, before joining the WAAF. They sent her to Palestine in 1945, where she should have been off-duty at the King David Hotel when it was bombed in 1946, but serendipity saw her exchange shifts, and she was working elsewhere when the bomb went off.
Marriage and children
She married Julian Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith, at the Brompton Oratory in 1947. Her husband took diplomatic postings in Libya, Zanzibar, and St Lucia, and he was the Governor in the Seychelles. At that time, you could not fly easily to these islands, but ships occasionally visited them.
Lord and Lady Oxford had five children – two sons, both diplomats, and three daughters (the middle one married to another diplomat):
Lady (Mary) Annunziata Asquith (born 28 July 1948), partner of Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield.
Lady Katharine Rose Celestine Asquith (born 1 October 1949), in 1970 married Adam Ridley, divorced 1976; married secondly in 1985 Nathaniel Page, son of Sir John Page.
Raymond Benedict Bartholomew Asquith, 3rd Earl of Oxford and Asquith (born 24 August 1952)
Lady Clare Perpetua Frances Asquith (born 28 March 1955)
The Hon. Sir Dominic Antony Gerard Asquith, KCMG (born 7 February 1957), a former British Ambassador to Iraq, Egypt and Libya.
Lord Oxford inherited the estate of Mells Manor from his mother Katharine Asquith, younger daughter of Sir John Horner, of Mells, and his wife Lady Frances (née Graham).
Lady Oxford died in Frome in 1998. Lord Oxford died, aged 94, on 16 January 2011. He was succeeded in his peerage titles, which he had held for over eighty years, by his elder son, Raymond, a former British diplomat and elected hereditary member of the House of Lords.

Bishop Ian Murray (15 December 1932 – 22 January 2016), was a Scottish divine, the ninth Bishop of Argyll & the Isles after the restoration of the hierarchy.
Early life
Ian Murray was born in Lennoxtown, Stirlingshire, as the eldest of the four children of John Murray and Margaret Rodgers. He was educated at St Machan's Primary School in Lennoxtown, St Ninian's High School in Kirkintilloch and the National Junior Seminary at St Mary's College in Blairs, Aberdeen.
His great uncle Paddy Murray was a footballer who played for Hibernian and Scotland.
Priesthood
After Blairs, he completed his ecclesiastical studies at the Royal Scots College (el Real Colegio de los Escoceses), Valladolid. He was ordained to the Priesthood for the Archdiocese of St Andrews & Edinburgh in the college chapel on 17 March 1956 by Bishop Joseph McGee.
After ordination, Father Murray served at St Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral, Edinburgh, St Kenneth's, Lochore and St Columba's, Edinburgh. Thereafter he returned to Valladolid as Vice-Rector until 1970. On returning to Scotland he was appointed as the Catholic chaplain to the University of Stirling where he remained until 1977. He then served at Our Lady & St Bride's, Cowdenbeath and subsequently at St Ninian's, Restalrig.
In 1987 Father Murray was appointed Rector of the Royal Scots College in Valladolid. He assisted with the transfer of the College to Salamanca in 1988 and remained there until his return to Scotland in 1994. On recommencing his work in the Archdiocese he served in Galashiels, Falkirk and was appointed Vicar General of the Archdiocese of St Andrews & Edinburgh.
Episcopate
In 1999, Monsignor Ian Murray was nominated ninth Bishop of Argyll & the Isles by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated by Archbishop Keith Michael Patrick O'Brien on 7 December that year, the feast of St Ambrose, a patron of the Royal Scots College.
On 15 December 2008, reaching 75 years of age, in accordance with Canon Law, Bishop Murray submitted his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI, who appointed the Very Reverend Monsignor Joseph Anthony Toal, the Rector of the Royal Scots College, to succeed him as tenth Bishop of Argyll & the Isles. In retirement Bishop Murray lived at St Columba's, Newington, St Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral, Edinburgh and then, until his death in January 2016, with the Little Sisters of the Poor at St Joseph's House, Gilmore Place, Edinburgh.
Following his demise, Requiem Mass was offered for Bishop Murray in the presence of the Metropolitan of St Andrews & Edinburgh and the hierarchy of Scotland at St Columba's Cathedral, Oban on Friday 5 February 2016. On the same day he was buried at Pennyfuir Cemetery alongside his predecessors.
Bishop Murray's motto "Obedience gives strength" was taken from the writings of St Teresa of Avila who once wrote, “When I was in Salamanca in 1571 the Lord said to me, 'Daughter, obedience gives strength'”.

Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus Maximus (died 210 BC) was a consul of the Roman Republic in 211 BC. As consul, Fulvius defended Rome against Hannibal with his colleague Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus during the Second Punic War.
Fulvius was curule aedile in 214 BC, presenting a four-day program of theatrical events (ludi scaenici) with his colleague Publius Sempronius Tuditanus. As praetor the following year, he was stationed at Suessula and received the knights from Capua who had decided to defect from Hannibal and join Rome.
For his consular province (provincia) he was assigned to Apulia. He returned to Rome to hold elections for the following year, while Sulpicius went to assume command in Greece. Fulvius's imperium in Apulia was prorogued for the year 210. He was killed at the Battle of Herdonia in a surprise attack by Hannibal.

Poecilotriccus is a genus of small flycatchers in the family Tyrannidae. Except for the recently described Johnson's tody-flycatcher, all have, at one point or another, been included in the genus Todirostrum. Some species have been known as tody-tyrants instead of tody-flycatchers. Most species are found in South America, but a single species, the slate-headed tody-flycatcher, is also found in Central America. The black-chested tyrant may also belong in this genus, but most place it in the monotypic genus Taeniotriccus.
Species
The genus contains 12 species:

The .429 DE is a cartridge introduced in 2018 by Magnum Research for the Desert Eagle line of handguns.
Design
The .429 DE is a .50 AE case that is necked down to accept .429-diameter (10.9mm) bullets used in the .44 Magnum. The cartridge features a 25% increase in velocity and 45% increase of energy over a standard 240-grain .44 Magnum load (1742 joules at 100 meters) . The .429 DE offers increased speed and accuracy over the .50 AE due to its lighter and slimmer projectile. Also, due to its use of the same cartridge design, one can easily convert a .50 AE Desert Eagle to .429 DE with only a barrel change. Magazines and bolts will both interchange between .50 AE and .429 DE. Though very similar to the obsolete .440 Cor-Bon, it is not interchangeable with that cartridge. The same bolt and magazines can be used as the .50 AE-chambered Desert Eagle.

Stokeley Clevon Goulbourne (born April 18, 1996), known professionally as Ski Mask the Slump God (formerly stylized as $ki Mask "The Slump God"), is an American rapper. He initially rose to prominence alongside XXXTentacion and their collective Members Only. In 2017, he released the singles "BabyWipe" and "Catch Me Outside", both of which were featured on his mixtape You Will Regret (2017), which was certified Gold by the RIAA.
Goulbourne's mixtape, Beware the Book of Eli, was released in May 2018 and peaked at No. 50 on the Billboard 200 chart. His debut album Stokeley (2018) peaked at number 6 on the US Billboard 200.
Early life
Stokeley Clevon Goulbourne was born on April 18, 1996, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He is of Jamaican descent.
Goulbourne grew up listening to Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliott, Wu-Tang Clan, and Lil Wayne, among other artists. He has said that his parents often played Jamaican music around the house. Goulbourne's father—a rapper who used the stage name "Sin City"—would often force his son to focus on writing his own rap music. In 2013, Goulbourne was sent to a juvenile detention center for possession of "around $10 worth of weed", where he met XXXTentacion. The duo became friends and frequently collaborated on songs after being released from detention.
Career
2014–2017: Mainstream debut
Following Goulbourne's release from detention, he formed the rap group "Very Rare" with XXXTentacion and released his first song "Catch Me" on the streaming service SoundCloud. Goulbourne eventually co-founded XXXTentacion's collective Members Only after the release of Members Only Vol. 1, a collaboration mixtape with XXXTentacion, in 2015. The mixtape would eventually be followed up with Members Only, Vol. 2 and then Members Only, Vol. 3 on June 26, 2017.
Goulbourne released multiple singles on the SoundCloud platform including "Catch Me Outside", "Where's the Blow" featuring Lil Pump, "Stunt!" featuring UnoTheActivist, "Life Is Short", "Like a Soccer Mom", "Take a Step Back", and "BabyWipe". Goulbourne has performed twice at the Rolling Loud Festival and has released songs with other artists including Offset, Lil Yachty, A$AP Ferg, Lil Peep, Desiigner, and Denzel Curry. Goulbourne has also collaborated with artists from the 88Rising label including the Higher Brothers and Keith Ape. Goulbourne also worked with Timbaland, who he had previously said was his favorite producer.
In May 2016, Goulbourne released his first mixtape Drown in Designer, which included the songs "Take a Step Back", which was later certified Gold, and "Where's the Blow". In June 2017, Goulbourne released his debut commercial mixtape You Will Regret under Victor Victor Worldwide and Republic Records.
2018–present: Stokeley and Sin City The Mixtape
In May 2018, Goulbourne released his third mixtape Beware the Book of Eli, which featured the single "DoIHaveTheSause?". In June that same year, he was named one of XXLs "2018 Freshman Class". On November 30, 2018, Goulbourne released his debut studio album, Stokeley, which includes the songs "Faucet Failure" and "Nuketown" featuring Juice Wrld. The album peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200 chart.
Following the success of Stokeley, Goulbourne released only one single in 2019, "Carbonated Water". In July 2020, he released the single "Burn the Hoods" alongside a music video on Lyrical Lemonade. Simultaneously, he announced that his second album would release later that year, however the album was never released. Goulbourne has stated that he plans to release more music to the public.
In May 2021, Goulbourne announced a mixtape titled Sin City The Mixtape to be released in June. He released Sin City on June 25.
Musical style
Goulbourne has said that his musical production has been most influenced by Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliot, and Chief Keef. Goulbourne has also stated he does not have any main musical influences; "I listen to every genre: rap, rock, classical, heavy metal...I listen to Adele sometimes too".
Personal life
As of June 2018, Golbourne lives in Atlanta, Georgia. He had a heart condition that required surgery in March 2018.
In a 2016 interview, Goulbourne signaled support for the legalization of gay marriage. In 2020, Goulbourne expressed distaste for President Donald Trump, comparing him to a white supremacist.
Friendships
XXXTentacion
Goulbourne was close friends with XXXTentacion before they both started rapping. They met in a juvenile center in 2013. Goulbourne said in an interview with Adam22 that he was surprised by X's criminal charges. Whilst in jail, X had taught Goulbourne about different rapping cadences. After the duo were released, they met up with the intention of committing home invasions but instead began releasing music together. The rappers founded the collective Members Only. In 2017, Goulbourne and XXXTentacion embarked on The Revenge Tour with Craig Xen. The tour was postponed following the shooting of XXXTentacion's cousin. By late 2017, the two had parted ways and begun working on their own projects. Around this time, it was insinuated that the two were feuding.
At the Rolling Loud Miami festival in 2018, Goulbourne and XXXTentacion were reunited, reaffirming their friendship. On June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion was murdered; Goulbourne learned of his best friend's death while on Instagram Live and tearfully informed his fans of the rapper's death.
Juice Wrld
In early 2018, Goulbourne befriended rising rapper Juice Wrld. The two went on to collaborate on the track "Nuketown", which became Goulbourne's highest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100. It was announced that the two were working on a mixtape titled Evil Twins, but the project never released. In 2019, following the release of Juice Wrld's second album, the two embarked on the Death Race for Love Tour together along with Cole Bennett of Lyrical Lemonade.
On December 8, 2019, Juice Wrld died from an opioid-induced seizure. Goulbourne reacted emotionally to the news of the rapper's death. Goulbourne was present at Juice Wrld's funeral later that month.
Aftermath
The death of his two best friends in a span of eighteen months had a profound impact on Goulbourne. Following XXXTentacion's death, Goulbourne honored him multiple times during his own concerts; Goulbourne met XXXTentacion's son, Gekyume Onfroy, for the first time in person at a show.
Controversies
Concert incidents
During a concert at The Fonda Theatre, Los Angeles, on April 11, 2017, Goulbourne was pushed off stage and then assaulted by an associate of rapper Rob Stone. The attack was said to be instigated by an ongoing feud between the two rappers, starting when Goulbourne refused to leave the stage during Stone's opening act. Rob Stone was kicked off the remainder of Desiigner's Outlet Tour.
During a concert on August 10, 2018, in Austin, Texas, Goulbourne asked the crowd for a moment of silence for his murdered friend XXXTentacion. An audience member heckled, "Fuck X, that woman-beating piece of shit!" Goulbourne threatened the audience member and told the rest of the audience to "fuck his ass up", leading to a melee fight. While the crowd was beating the man, Goulbourne played one of XXXTentacion's most popular songs, "Look at Me" before the venue's security dispersed the disturbance and escorted the man outside of the venue.
Legal issues
In 2014, Goulbourne was sent to a juvenile detention center for possession of marijuana. Goulbourne was arrested for driving with a suspended license, driving without a license, and robbery in August 2016. He was later released on bail.

The Gnome King of Oz (1927) is the twenty-first in the series of Oz books created by L. Frank Baum and his successors, and the seventh by Ruth Plumly Thompson. Like nineteen of the twenty previous books, it was illustrated by John R. Neill.
Plot
Patch is the country of the Quilties, a land of seamstresses and quiltmakers; it lies in the Quadling quadrant of Oz. Its people have a serious problem. Their queen, Cross Patch the Sixth, has gone to pieces—literally; small pieces too. To find her successor, the land's Chief Scrapper and Prime Piercer unwind the Spool of Succession, and follow where the golden thread leads. It leads, in this instance, to the Emerald City, where it selects Scraps, the Patchwork Girl of Oz (first introduced in her eponymously titled novel, the seventh Oz book by L. Frank Baum) to be the new queen. The two Quilties, used to resistance from Queens-to-be (it's not that good a job), kidnap Scraps.
Meanwhile, Peter Brown, a boy from Philadelphia, is transported by a balloon bird to the Runaway Island, where Ruggedo, the wicked Gnome King has been exiled for five years (see Kabumpo in Oz). A seaquake reveals the sunken pirate ship of Polacky the Plunderer—which contains the magic chest of Soob the Sorcerer. The chest holds several magic treasures, including a magic cloak that is supposed to render the wearer invisible and teleport him anywhere he chooses. But the cloak is torn and does not work. The ship, however, derelict as it is, allows Peter and Ruggedo to drift to the Land of Ev.
Promising to make Peter a general in his army, Ruggedo returns to the Gnome Kingdom and forces the current king, Kaliko, to abdicate in his favor. Ruggedo's plan is to have the cloak mended, then use it to fly to the Emerald City and recover his magic belt, with all its power — but he learns that the tricky repair job can only be done properly by the expert tailors in Patch. With Peter, he makes his way to Patch, where he offers Peter as a slave in return for the repair of the cloak. The Patch ministers accept this offer and the cloak is repaired.
Peter meets Scraps and makes other new friends, including Grumpy the Bear and Ozwold the Ostrich. Together they escape from Patch and set out for the Emerald City in order to warn Ozma about Ruggedo's plans. Meanwhile, using the power of the repaired cloak, Ruggedo becomes invisible and teleports to the Emerald City, where he causes some mischief before Peter arrives. Still invisible, Ruggedo steals the magic belt. He is about to use its powers to teleport Ozma and her friends to the bottom of the ocean, but Peter overcomes him by throwing a "silence stone", one of the treasures he had taken from the sunken pirate ship, at Ruggedo's head, which robs Ruggedo of the power of speech. Since the magic belt only responds to spoken commands, this renders Ruggedo harmless, and the Wizard of Oz makes him visible again. Ozma makes Peter a Prince of Oz, but the boy chooses to return to Philadelphia; he can't let down his team.

Bridge Meadow Stadium, also known as the Ogi Bridge Meadow Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a multi-purpose stadium in Haverfordwest, Wales. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Haverfordwest County A.F.C. The stadium holds 2,467 people.
History
Bridge Meadow Stadium was built in the mid-1990s as the new home venue of Haverfordwest County. In August 2021, the club signed a sponsorship deal with the Welsh Fibre Broadband company Ogi for naming rights at the ground. As a result, the ground was renamed the Ogi Bridge Meadow Stadium. The ground has hosted matches featuring the Wales women's national football team and its youth sides.
Layout
The main area of the ground is the Main Stand which is all-seated, covered stand that runs for most of the length of the pitch. The remaining areas at the side of the stand are used as spectator standing areas. Directly opposite the Main Stand, are two small, all-seated stands that are separated by a press and TV camera gantry.
The club's offices and changing rooms are located at one end of the pitch, known as the Town End. The building has a small standing terrace between it and the pitch. The opposite end of the pitch features a similar, small standing terrace for spectators. There are eight floodlights at the ground, split between four on each side of the pitch.
The away end of the stadium is located at the North of the pitch. Access is gained via Well Lane.

The Great Redwood Trail is a proposed multi-use rail-to-trail project connecting San Francisco and Humboldt bays in Northern California. Most of the trail will be built on the rail bed of the defunct Northwestern Pacific Railroad along the Eel River Canyon by the Great Redwood Trail Agency. The southern portion will be built by Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) along their commuter rail line. The trail route is within 5 counties, 14 cities and the ancestral territory of many tribes. Some portions have already constructed by local jurisdictions with more being developed in cooperation with local governments.
The Great Redwood Trail Agency was established in March 2022. The agency took over management of the railroad corridor from the North Coast Railroad Authority to begin preparing a master plan to develop the trail. The California Coastal Conservancy is providing staff for the agency since they have decades experience with the California Coastal Trail. Situated in Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino, Trinity, and Humboldt Counties, the route passes through the cities of Novato, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Windsor, Healdsburg, Cloverdale, Ukiah, Willits, Fortuna, Rio Dell, Eureka, Arcata, and Blue Lake. The first completed segment of the trail was celebrated by State Senator Mike McGuire in Ukiah in February 2020. The city approved the construction of the final trail segment for the entire within the city in September 2021. A section in the city of Willits is being planned. The trail will pass through the Eel River Canyon Preserve includes the Grand Canyon of the Wild and Scenic Eel River which is home to dozens of endangered species and rare wildlife. The trail alignment through the Eel River will be challenging due to erosive geology and some failing infrastructure, including tunnels, bridges, and trestles. The project also has to deal with private property owners on either side of the trail right-of-way. Two or three years of public meetings will be held before the master plan is released.

Ayrshire County, Queensland is one of the 318 counties of Queensland, Australia. The county came into existence in the 19th century, and on 8 March 1901, the Governor of Queensland issued a proclamation legally dividing Queensland into counties under the Land Act 1897.
Like all counties in Queensland, it is a non-functional administrative unit, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles. From 30 November 2015, the government no longer referenced counties and parishes in land information systems however the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying retains a record for historical purposes.
The entire county is incorporated with the seat of local government being at Winton.
The Diamantina River ring feature covers the western half of the county. The county is divided into civil parishes.

Mississippi Highway 584 (MS 584) is a state highway in Amite and Pike counties of southern Mississippi, United States. It connects the towns of Liberty and Osyka via Gillsburg.
Route description
MS 584 begins in Amite County in downtown Liberty at an intersection with MS 24/MS 48/MS 569 (Main Street). It heads south through neighborhoods along Gillsburg Road before turning east along Osyka Road to leave Liberty and continue southeast through a mix of farmland and wooded areas for the next several miles, where it crosses a bridge over the East Fork Amite River. The highway then passes through Gillsburg, where it has an intersection with MS 568 and crosses a bridge over the Tickfaw River. MS 584 continues east through rural areas for several miles, where it has intersections with MS 571 and MS 923 and comes very close to the Louisiana border, in some areas within less than a mile. It now crosses into Pike County and has an interchange with Interstate 55 (I-55) at its exit 1 shortly before entering Osyka. MS 584 enters the town along Liberty Street and passes southeast through neighborhoods before coming to an end at an intersection with U.S. Route 51 (US 51), just northwest of downtown. The entire route of MS 584 is a two-lane highway.

Heart is a studio album by French singer Amanda Lear, first released in 2001 by Le Marais Prod.
Background
The album was recorded in 2001 at Barouf Studio and Studio Wolf with French producers FX Costello and Laurent Wolf, and was Lear's first album ever to be recorded entirely in France. It was also her first studio release of new material in six years, since 1995's Alter Ego. In an interview, the singer explained that the long gap resulted from her lack of enthusiasm after numerous budget compilations started to appear on the market without her consent. She also revealed that on this album she was given more artistic freedom than before, and decided to include more melodic and sentimental songs. Lear stated that Heart was the album "she has always wanted to make" and that originally, she planned to called it Phoenix.
The material was an equal mixture of upbeat pop-dance tunes and downtempo compositions, including covers of "Hier Encore" by Charles Aznavour, "The Look of Love" by Burt Bacharach and "L'importante è finire", originally performed by Italian singer Mina, as well as songs based on texts by the likes of Paulo Coelho and Charles Baudelaire. For the third time in her career, Lear recorded the wartime classic "Lili Marleen", this time with updated lyrics, written by Norbert Schultze shortly before his passing. Heart showcases Lear's polyglotism and is the only album to feature her singing in all five languages: English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish.
The record yielded two singles. A cover of "Love Boat", the theme song to a popular American TV series of the same title was released in June 2001. It was followed by the dance track "I Just Wanna Dance Again", released as a single in 2002, accompanied by multiple remixes. An edited version of the Pumpin' Dolls remix was used in the song's music video, directed by Kris Gautier. Both singles were moderately successful and Heart proved to be Lear's best selling album since the late 1970s in both France and Germany. It has reportedly sold 50,000 copies as of June 2002.
The album was first released in a digipak in late 2001 (nearly a year after the death of her husband), followed by a standard jewel case reissue. In the same year, the album was again re-released, this time swapping the front picture with the back cover photo. In 2002, Dance Street released Heart in Germany, with a different artwork and slightly rearranged track listing. In 2003, the album was released in Europe as Tendance, with bonus tracks and significant changes to the original track listing. 2004 saw another re-release of the album in Germany, sporting new title Love Boat and new artwork, but retaining the 2002 edition's track listing.

William Francis Moran Jr. (May 1, 1925 – February 12, 2006), also known as Bill Moran, was a pioneering American knifemaker who founded the American Bladesmith Society and reintroduced the process of making pattern welded steel to modern knife making. Moran's knives were sought after by celebrities and heads-of-state. The "William F. Moran School of Bladesmithing" bears his name and in addition to founding the ABS, he was a Blade Magazine Hall of Fame Member and a President of the Knifemakers' Guild.
Early life
Moran was born on a dairy farm near Lime Kiln, Maryland in 1925. There he learned the craft of blacksmithing by trial and error using an old coal forge that he found on the farm and made his first knife at the age of 12; by the age of 14 he was making knives to sell. As a teenager he taught himself how to forge a blade, obtaining advice from local blacksmiths (although in a 2003 interview with The Washington Post, Moran said he was "getting all the wrong answers" from them) and by the 1950s he was publishing a catalog and selling his forged blades. In 1960 he sold the family farm to become a full-time knife maker.
Knife making
Moran forged his knives using a coal forge in the manner of a blacksmith using a hammer and anvil to shape the steel. In the 1950s he was one of the last few bladesmiths in the United States, forging his metal as opposed to grinding blades out of stock. Moran began trying to revive the ancient process of forging Damascus steel in the late 1960s. However, few living bladesmiths knew the exact techniques and without a recipe for the process, it was in danger of being lost; through trial and error he taught himself pattern welding and referred to it as "Damascus steel".
In 1972, Moran was elected president of the Knifemakers' Guild. The following year he unveiled his "Damascus knives" at the Guild Show and created a revival of interest in the forged blade, and along with the knives he gave away free booklets detailing how he made them. In 1976 he founded the American Bladesmith Society (ABS), a group of knife makers dedicated to preserving the forged blade and educating the public about traditional bladesmithing techniques. Moran had a 20-year-long waiting list and sold knives to such celebrities as Sylvester Stallone and members of royalty including Queen Elizabeth II and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. According to The Washington Post, Sylvester Stallone's knife cost the actor $7,000 and included over 30 feet of silver wire in the handle.
Death
Moran died of cancer on February 12, 2006, at Frederick Memorial Hospital. After his death, one of his Bowie knives sold for $30,000 at auction. According to his obituary in The Washington Post, Moran willed his forge and tools to the Frederick County Landmarks Foundation.
Legacy
Apart from his influence regarding the forged blade, pattern welding, and damascus steel, Moran's influence has spread to other realms of the cutlery industry beyond "Art Knives". Copies of Moran's knives have been made by production knife companies. Spyderco has long made a Drop point hunting knife, inspired by a Moran designs. Blackjack Knives made several tactical versions of Moran's fighting knives. Paul Chen's Hanwei Forge of China made a damascus steel version of the Moran Kenshar, complete with silver wire inlay. Custom Knifemaker Ernest Emerson has long stated that the Moran ST-23 was one of the inspirations for his CQC-8 folding knife.
In 1986, Moran was inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame. Two years later in 1988, Moran and the ABS founded a Bladesmithing School in cooperation with Texarkana College. The campus was located in Washington, Arkansas near the place where James Black, made the first Bowie knife. In 1996, Moran was inducted into the American Bladesmith Society Hall of Fame as an inauguree. From 1988 to 2001, Moran taught at least one class a year at the school. Upon his retirement from teaching in 2001, the school was renamed the "William F. Moran School of Bladesmithing".
As of 2008, the American Bladesmith Society is in the process of creating a Moran Museum as a wing of a new Frederick County Library in Middletown, Maryland, less than a mile from where Moran's shop stood.

"Dangerous" was a song released in 1985 on the highly successful album Lovin' Every Minute of It released by Loverboy. The song achieved minor success when released as a single during the same year, and reached #65 on the Billboard charts.
The song was written by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, and was originally recorded by Adams, under the title "Reckless", for his hit 1984 album of the same name. However, it was ultimately left off the final track list. When Loverboy later used the song, they changed the title and chorus lyrics. The Bryan Adams' version eventually saw a release on the 30th anniversary reissue of Reckless.
Cash Box said that it "captures the raw energy of Loverboy with a killer chorus hook." Billboard called it an "oversized, megarock cruncher."

Hine is a surname deriving from Middle English.
Etymology
According to the Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland, the modern name Hine and its variants derive from the Middle English word hine (with the addition of the genitive -s case ending in forms like Hines, implying that the name-bearer was the child of a father called Hine, or addition of -s on the analogy of such names). This occupational name derives from Old English hīne ('household servant, farm labourer'), but in the Middle English period could also mean 'farm manager' and also be used of high-status people serving in a lordly household.
Distribution
Around 2011, there were 2899 bearers of the surname Hine in Great Britain and 21 in Ireland. In 1881, there were 2301 bearers of the name in Great Britain, concentrated in Devon.

The black-chested prinia (Prinia flavicans) is a species of bird in the family Cisticolidae.
It is found in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
Its natural habitat is dry savanna.
Prinias are small warblers that can be distinguished from other warblers by their long tails often held in a near-vertical position. All species are sexually monomorphic. There are four species in the Prinia genus in southern Africa. The three other species are as follows: tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia subflava), Karoo prinia (Prinia maculosa), and Drakensberg prinia (Prinia hypoxantha). Of these four, the black-chested prinia is the only species that has different breeding and non-breeding plumages. The black-chested prinia is aptly named for the charcoal-colored breast band apparent in its breeding plumage.
Description
Appearance
Black-chested prinias are small, long-tailed warblers whose body sizes range from 13 to 15 centimeters. They are a pale golden-brown on their dorsal side and during the non-breeding season they have pale yellow dorsal plumage. In their alternate plumage (breeding season), they develop a black breast-band and their underparts become white or a buttery yellow.
Voice
Black-chested prinias make a loud, repeated “chip-chip-chip” call as well as a buzzy sequence of “zrrrt-zrrrt-zrrrt” sounds.
Distribution and Habitat
This species is near-endemic to the southern African thornbelt. Black-chested prinias are most abundant in the Kalahari Basin, where their average densities are 0.7 ha per individual. They experience three distinct seasons within their subtropical climate range:
September - October: very hot, dry spring
November - May: hot, wet summer
June - August: cold, dry winter (Herremans).
Along with Acacia habitats, Olea-Buddleia vegetation (within the Cymbopogon-Themeda grassveld) is important in the nesting and feeding habits of black-chested prinia.
Behavior
Feeding
Like other Prinia, insects make up a majority of black-chested prinias' diet. In a study conducted by Kopij in 2005, small beetles were found to account for one-third of this species' diet. Beetle and weevil larvae, as well as adult flies, comprised much of the birds' stomach contents in Kopij's study. Plant matter like seeds, leaves, and berries are also a non-negligible part of this species' diet. Black-chested prinias have also been observed probing unopened Aloe marlothii flowers in South Africa during the winter season.
Breeding
Black-chested prinias usually breed during the summer, but their breeding behavior can be erratic due to their dependence on rains. Individuals may take advantage of unseasonal rains during the non-breeding season and breed during the winter.
This species is known to be parasitized by the parasitic weaver (Anomalospiza imberbis). One to two parasitic weaver chicks per clutch have been found to be raised by black-chested prinia parental hosts in Acacia habitats near grasslands.
Movement
Though black-chested prinias are not thought to be migratory, there is evidence that they may be locally nomadic. Herremans found that black-chested prinias expand their range during severe droughts, becoming a bit nomadic in order to adapt to challenging environmental conditions. Kopij noticed a seasonal decrease in the local populations of black-chested prinias in "inselbergs" (bushy isolated hills within dry grasslands) .
Molting
Black-chested prinias have a complete biannual molt, meaning that they undergo a complete molt (including flight feathers) twice a year. This species' spring molt (September-November) is a short one of approximately 10 weeks. The autumn molt (February-June, with 95% of adults molting in April) is a longer one of approximately 15 weeks. A complete biannual molt like this one is quite rare in passerines. The evolutionary path of birds with complete biannual cycles is not well understood, though Beltran et al. found that birds following this molting strategy experience strict seasonality in food resources, integument damage, insulation requirements, and camouflage requirements.
This species' molt shows a consistent pattern dependent on season, but the erratic nature of their breeding season results in an occasional overlap of breeding and molting cycles. When molting overlaps with breeding in the autumn, black-chested prinias molt into their alternate plumage (with the black breast-band) even though they are nearing the non-breeding season.

is a Japanese football club from Ebetsu, Hokkaido, within the Sapporo metropolitan area. They play in the Hokkaido League, the regionalized fifth level of the Japanese football league system.
History
It was founded on 1985 as Hokkaido Electric Power Company F.C., as a branch of the regional utility. In 2004 the club changed its name to Norbritz, and began as an independent entity. The club name of Norbritz is a portmanteau of the German words "nord" and "blitz" (albeit improperly romanised; the correct should be Norblitz), meaning Northern Lightning.
They have won the Hokkaido League a record 18 times. In 2012, after winning the Hokkaido League, Norbritz played the Regional League promotion series, ending in third place and therefore qualifying to play a play-off series against the 17th-placed team of the 2012 Japan Football League, Tochigi Uva F.C. They barely lost the series on penalties and therefore missed the chance to play in the JFL.

The Jewish Communist Labour Bund in Poland (), generally referred to as the Kombund, was a Jewish political party in Poland. It was formed in 1922, after a split from the General Jewish Labour Bund in 1921 (which had seen the emergence of the Kombund fraktsie, 'Communist Bund fraction' inside the Bund). The split was provoked by disagreements over whether the Polish Bund should join the Communist International. At the first Polish Bund conference in 1920 a majority of resolution passed, calling for the party to join the Communist International. The decision was never executed however, leading to the split and the formation of Kombund. The Kombund was founded in late January 1922, by Communist Bundist groups. The new party affiliated itself to the Communist International, adopting the twenty-one conditions. Around 25% of the Bund membership in Poland joined the Kombund.
According to one account, around 50% of the Bundist membership in Łódź had joined Kombund. The local Bundist newspaper, Lodzer veker, was taken over by Kombund.
Immediately after the split, the Bund and Kombund began fighting over control of trade unions. Important leaders of the textile, leather and paper workers' unions had sided with the Kombund in the split. The leather workers' union was seized by Kombund, soon to be followed by the clothing workers' union.
Kombund published ('Our Thought') from Łódź.
Soon after the foundation of the Kombund, negotiations began with the Communist Party of Poland regarding a merger between the two parties. In September the final decision was taken on the Kombund's merger into the Polish Communist Party. Just before the merger, the Kombund has suffered setbacks in trade union elections in Łódź and Cracow.
Shortly after the merger, the Polish Communist Party established its Central Jewish Bureau.

In supply chain management, the Kraljic matrix (or Kraljic model) is a method used to segment the purchases or suppliers of a company by dividing them into four classes, based on the complexity (or risk) of the supply market (such as monopoly situations, barriers to entry, technological innovation) and the importance of the purchases or suppliers (determined by the impact that they have on the profitability of the company). This subdivision allows the company to define the optimal purchasing strategies for each of the four types of purchases or suppliers.
It is named after Peter Kraljic, who first formulated the model in an article called Purchasing Must Become Supply Management, published in the Harvard Business Review in 1983.
Overview
The Kraljic matrix defines the following types of articles:
Non-critical items: components that have a low impact on the company and that are found in abundance and / or in low-risk markets (e.g., office stationery). For such items, the goal should be to maximize efficiency of the procurement process to reduce the administrative burden, for example by delegating purchasing to local managers, or using catalogs.
Leverage items: components that are important for the company but sourced from low-risk markets with an abundant supply. As the name suggests, the optimal management of these purchase categories is essential to ensure a satisfactory business result. For this type of component, the company tends to make the most of its bargaining power and the abundance of the offer with frequent negotiations.
Bottleneck items: components with a low business impact in economic terms but where supply continuity is at risk. The management of these components should be aimed at creating relationships of collaboration in the medium-long term between customer and supplier to guarantee the supply, with less emphasis on the cost.
Strategic items: components that are important for the company both in terms of economic impact and for supply conditions from complex and / or risky markets. In this field, the horizon is medium-long term with a continuous monitoring of the economic situation of the market, technical evolution, evaluation of "make-or-buy", creation of alternatives and development of stable relationships and maximum collaboration with the suppliers.
In its original form, Kralijic's matrix is used for the mapping of purchases, not suppliers. However, the matrix works equally well to distinguish different categories of suppliers.

Dragons are present in Germanic mythology and folklore, where they are often portrayed as large venomous serpents. Especially in later tales, however, they share many common features with other dragons in European mythology.
Origin, appearance and terminology
In early depictions, as with dragons in other cultures, the distinction between Germanic dragons and regular snakes is blurred, with both being referred to as Old Norse or Old English from Proto-Germanic *wurmiz. Wyrm has since been borrowed back into Modern English to mean "dragon", while the cognate worm is uncommonly used in Modern English to refer specifically to wingless dragons.
In Fáfnismál, the dragon Fáfnir is described as flightless and snake-like, and is referred to as an . In the later Völsunga saga, however, he has shoulders, suggesting legs, wings or both, and is referred to as both a and an . Similarly, the dragon in Beowulf is referred to as both a and a , although in some sources such as Ketils saga hœngs and the 14th century romance saga Konráðs saga keisarasonar, ormar and drekar are portrayed as distinct beings, with winged dragons sometimes specified as (flying dragons). Old Norse and Old English mean "dragon, sea serpent or sea monster" and are in turn derived from Proto-Germanic *drakō, an early borrowing from Latin draco "huge serpent or dragon".
The evolution of wingless and legless worms and lindworms to flying, four-legged romanesque dragons in Germanic folklore and literature is most likely due to influence from continental Europe that was facilitated by Christianisation and the increased availability of translated romances. It has thus been proposed that the description in Völuspá of Níðhöggr with feathers and flying after Ragnarök is a late addition and potentially a result of the integration of pagan and Christian imagery.
To address the difficulties with categorising Germanic dragons, the term drakorm has been proposed, referring to beings described as either dreki or ormr.
List of Germanic dragons
is a dragon attested in the Eddas that gnaws at the roots of Yggdrasil and the corpses of Náströnd.
, also known as the Midgard Serpent, is described as a giant, venomous beast and the child of Loki and Angrboða.
is a widely attested dragon that has a prominent role in the Cycle. Fafnir was originally a dwarf who took the form of a dragon after claiming a hoard of treasure, including Andvaranaut, from his father. He was later killed by Sigurd (Sigfried) who hid in a pit and stabbed him from underneath with a sword.
The contains a description of a dragon killed by Frotho I. The dragon is described as "the keeper of the mountain." After Frotho I kill the dragon, he takes its hoard of treasure. The Gesta Danorum describes another dragon fight where a dragon is slain by Friðleifr and it is similar to the story of Frotho I.
There are several sagas with dragons in them, including Þiðreks saga, Övarr-Odds saga, and Sigrgarðs saga frækna, among others.
Common traits
Guarding treasure
The association between dragons and hoards of treasure is widespread in Germanic literature.
In the Völsung Cycle, was a dwarf who, upon claiming a hoard of treasure, including the ring Andvaranaut, transforms into a dragon. Fáfnir's brother, Regin reforges the sword Gram from broken shards and gives it to the hero Sigurd who uses it to kill the dragon by waiting in a hole until the worm slithers over and exposes his underbelly. While dying Fáfnir speaks with Sigurd and shares mythological knowledge. Sigurd then cooks and tastes the dragon's heart, allowing the hero to understand the speech of birds who tell him to kill Regin, which he does and then takes the hoard for himself. In Beowulf, it is Sigmund (the father of Sigurd in Old Norse tradition) who kills a dragon and takes its hoard.
In Beowulf, the dragon that the poem's eponymous hero is awoken from the burial mound in which it dwells when a cup from its hoard is stolen, leading it to seek vengeance from the Geats. After both the dragon and Beowulf die, the treasure is reinterred in the king's barrow. The Old English poem, Maxims II further states:
In Ragnars saga loðbrókar, Thóra, the daughter of a Geatish earl, is given a snake by her father which she puts on top of a pile of gold. This makes both the snake and the treasure grows until the dragon is so large its head touches its tail. The image of an encircled snake eating its own tail is also seen with Jörmungandr. The hero Ragnar Lodbrok later wins the hand of Thóra and the treasure by slaying the dragon. The motif of gold causing a snake-like creature to grow into a dragon is seen in the Icelandic tale of the Lagarfljót Worm recorded in the 19th century.
Breathing fire and poison
Dragons with poisonous breath are believed to predate those who breathe fire in Germanic folklore and literature, consistent with the theory that Germanic dragons developed from traditions regarding wild snakes, some of whom produce venom. The Nine Herbs Charm describes nine plants being used to overcome the venom of a slithering . It tells that Wōden defeats the by striking it with nine twigs, breaking it into nine pieces.
In Eddic poetry, both and the sea serpent are described as having poisonous breath. In Gylfaginning it is told that during Ragnarök, Thor will kill Jörmungandr however after taking nine steps, he will be in turn killed by the worm's venom. A similar creature from Orcadian folklore is the poisonous stoor worm which was killed by the hero Assipattle, falling into the sea and forming Iceland, Orkney, Shetland and the Faroe Islands. As in the English tale of the Linton worm, the stoor worm is killed by burning its insides with peat.
Beowulf is one of the earliest examples of a fire-breathing dragon yet it is also referred to as "the poison scourge" (). After burning homes and land in Geatland, it fights the eponymous hero of the poem who bears a metal shield to protect himself from the fire. The dragon wounds him but is slain by the king's thane Wiglaf. Beowulf later succumbs to the dragon's poison and dies. The other dragon mentioned in the poem is further associated with fire, melting from its own heat once slain by Sigmund. Both fire and venom are also spat by dragons in the Chivalric saga Sigurðr saga þögla and in Nikolaus saga erkibiskups II, written around 1340 AD, in which the dragon is sent by God to teach an English deacon to become more pious.
Material culture
Carved dragon heads
Drakkar were ships used by Vikings in the Medieval period that featured carved prows in the shape of dragons. One version of the Icelandic Landnámabók states that the ancient Heathen law of Iceland required any ship having a dragon figurehead in place on one's ship "with gaping mouth or yawning snout" to remove the carving before coming in sight of land because it would frighten the landvættir.
Stave churches are sometimes decorated by carved dragon heads which has been proposed to have originated in the belief in their apotropaic function.
Depictions of entire dragons
Medieval depictions of worms carved in stone feature both in Sweden and the British Isles. In Sweden, runic inscriptions dated to around the 11th century often show a lindworm bearing the text encircling the remaining picture on the stone. Some Sigurd stones such as U 1163, Sö 101 (the Rasmund carving) and Sö 327 (the Gök inscription) show a Sigurd thrusting a sword through the worm which is identified as Fáfnir. The killing of Fáfnir is also potentially pictured on four crosses from the Isle of Man and a now lost fragment, with a similar artistic style, from the church at Kirby Hill in England.
Wooden carvings from the Hylestad Stave Church of scenes from the Völsunga saga include Sigurd killing Fáfnir, who is notably shown with two legs and two wings.
The fishing trip described in Hymiskviða in which Thor catches has been linked to a number of stones in Scandinavia and England such as the Altuna Runestone and the Hørdum stone.

Nephtalí De León is a Chicano writer known primarily for his poetry, children's stories, and essays. He is also credited with illustrating most of his books. He was born in Laredo, Texas in 1945 as the son of migrant workers. Although neither of his parents received much formal education, Nephtalí says that they were responsible for first exposing him to literature. He published his first book—Chicanos: Our Background and Our Pride—in the early 1960s during his senior year of high school. He then expanded his work to include poetry and plays, dabbling in mural art and children's stories on the side (his first children's book I Will Catch the Sun received great praise). He has been published in Mexico, France, the U.S., and Spain with his stories being translated into several other languages (German, Russian, Chinese, and Vietnamese). Currently, Nephtalí is a full-time poet, writer, and painter who performs lectures and poetry at schools and community events.
Themes of his works
De León depicts the "dreams, desires, and aspirations" of the Chicano people. He believes that Chicanos have been "held in psychological and spiritual bondage...and that they are cultural and intellectual hostages in American society". In his works he tries to trace how this predicament has developed throughout history and he also attempts to display the dreams and attitudes of the Chicano people. His writings are based on ancient Aztec language and culture.

The 1969 Mongolian National Championship was the sixth recorded edition of the Mongolian National Championship for football, with the first tournament taking place in 1955 and no tournament held in 1965. It would appear however that championships were contested between 1956 and 1963, as sources note that a team called Aldar, the Mongolian Army Sports Club, won the title on numerous occasions during that time. Nonetheless, the 1969 national championship was won by Tengeriin Bugnuud, a team from Bat-Ölzii, a sum (district) of Övörkhangai Province in southern Mongolia, their second title following victory in the 1967 championship.

Raúl Castells (born 1950 in Rosario) is a controversial Argentine political activist. He is the leader of an organization called "Independent Movement for the Retired and Unemployed" (in Spanish, Movimiento Independiente de Jubilados y Desocupados, MIJD), a piquetero group.
Castells moved in 1984 to Santa Fe, where he would spend the next twenty years. He has been detained a number of times under the administration of President Néstor Kirchner; he and his supporters have protested that he is being subject to political persecution. Though Castells has sympathizers in Argentina, many other people disagree with his views.
Castells had a documentary made about him and his movement, called Raúl The Terrible. It was made by Australian political filmmaker David Bradbury and writer/producer, Carlos Alperin. A 'warts-and-all portrait of a man driven to change the world and a frightening insight into the politics of poverty.'In the beginning of March 2006, Castells was given permission to open a community kitchen for poor people at Puerto Madero, the most expensive and wealthy neighbourhood in the city. The site was donated by a business owner in the area who got his permit revoked. The building, offering free food to the poor, is situated opposite the Hilton Hotel and is topped with the words "We are fighting for an Argentina in which the dogs of the rich don't eat better than the children of the poor".
The project has proven controversial, with concerns about the influx of large numbers of impoverished people expressed by some local businessowners.

The team was owned by OverActive Media, based in Montreal, Quebec, and played in the North America region of OWC.
Franchise history
On February 14, 2019, OverActive Media, in partnership with esports team Mirage Sport Électronique, formally announced Toronto Defiant's academy team as "Montreal Rebellion". They began in Overwatch Contenders North America East and revealed their 2019 Season 1 roster, led by head coach Chris "Dream" Myrick.
In their first season of play, Rebellion finished 2–5 in the regular season and claimed the final playoff spot by finishing in sixth place. They defeated third-seeded Second Wind 3–1 in the quarterfinals before losing to two-seed and eventual champions Fusion University (Philadelphia Fusion's academy team). After the season, the team mutually parted ways with head coach Dream and announced Matthew "Optidox" Sims, who had led Angry Titans to the 2019 Season 1 EU championship, as the new head coach.
Prior to 2019 Season 2, Montreal Rebellion was moved to the North America West region. Part way through the season, Optidox left the team to become an assistant coach (and subsequently interim co-head coach) for the Toronto Defiant. Jesse "Jsr" Rangi was subsequently named head coach and finished out the season with the Rebellion. They finished in fifth place with a 4–3 record, though they were defeated by Second Wind, 3–1, in a quarterfinal rematch from the previous season.
After two weeks of the 2020 season, Rebellion quietly disbanded without an official announcement, reportedly due to budget cuts amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Burundi women's national football team, nicknamed the Swallows (French: Hirondelles), represents Burundi in women's international football competitions. The team has competed since 2016 in matches recognised by FIFA, the sport's international governing body. A senior national team has been continually inactive, but an under-20 team has played in numerous matches. Further development of football in the country faces challenges found across Africa, including inequality and limited access to education for women. A women's football programme did not exist in Burundi until 2000, and only 455 players had registered for participation on the national level by 2006.
History
In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team. While the sport grew in popularity worldwide in the ensuing years, Burundi did not have an official team until more than two decades later. By 2009, however, Burundi had a FIFA-recognised senior national team nicknamed the Swallows and a FIFA-recognised Burundi women's under-20 national team. The under-20 team played one international match in 2002, one in 2004 and one in 2006.
The senior national football team has never competed in a FIFA-sanctioned fixture and has not competed at the Women's World Cup. The team was one of 200 preparing for a qualification tournament for the cup in 2007, but did not play in the competition. The team has withdrawn from numerous other events. Burundi was to play in the 2008 African Women's Championship but withdrew from the tournament, giving the Democratic Republic of the Congo an automatic qualification. The team also withdrew from the 2010 and 2012 editions of the Africa Women Cup of Nations before the first-round qualifiers. Burundi has not participated in other major events on the continent, including the 2011 All-Africa Games. As of March 2012, the team was not ranked by FIFA.
Burundi was scheduled to participate in a competition in 2007 organised by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in Zanzibar. Nicholas Musonye, the secretary of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa), said of the event, "CAF wants to develop women's football in this region in recognition of the milestones Cecafa has achieved over the years. CAF appreciates what Cecafa has done despite the hardships the association has gone through, from financial problems to political instability in member states and poor management of associations. Member states in the Cecafa region have not taken women's football seriously. CAF now wants to sponsor a long-term campaign to attract women from this region into the game." The competition was canceled due to lack of funds.
Burundi's women's team was assembled in 2019 under coach Daniella Niyibimenya in anticipation of the 2019 CECAFA Women's Championship. The team was defeated 2–0 in a match with the Uganda women's national football team. Speaking on the team's lack of permanence and performance, Niyibimenya said, "We have a talented team but they need several warm-up matches to develop their character. Due to a lack of resources, we can only bring the girls together when a competition is announced."
Background and development
The development of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses.
The Football Federation of Burundi, the country's national association, created a woman's football programme in 2000. By 2006, there were just 455 registered women players, and the absence of a thriving women's game has been an obstacle for the national team. Lydia Nsekera is the head of the national football association.
Outside the national federation, the Commission nationale du football féminin was established by the 1990s, and a league and women's teams were organised in the same period in Bujumbura.

Klat Magazine is an independent publishing project launched at the end of 2009, in Milan, on the initiative of Paolo Priolo and Emanuela Carelli, with the aim of investigating the multifaceted space of contemporary art, design and architecture through a close encounter with its protagonists.
The name Klat comes from the word “talk” written back to front, and reflects the publishers' desire to develop a new vocabulary and new ways of exchanging views on the subjects covered.
Brief Summary
The project started out as a quarterly print periodical made up solely of very long interviews, published in two languages (Italian and English) and distributed in fifteen countries: Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal, China, Hong Kong, Malta, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and the United States.
Between 2009 and 2011 five issues came out, containing a total of forty interviews with leading exponents of contemporary design and creativity, including Stefano Boeri, Andrea Branzi, Alfredo Jaar, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Francesco Vezzoli, Rosa Barba, Maurizio Cattelan, Martino Gamper, Maarten Baas, John Maeda, Oliviero Toscani, Nigel Coates, Peter Eisenman, Martí Guixé, Toyo Ito, Jasper Morrison, Peter Zumthor.
In 2012 the publishers decided to wind up the print version and turn the original idea into an online magazine that proposes a daily mix of viewpoints, conversations, images and opinions, broadening the field of inquiry to embrace architecture, contemporary art, design, photography, fashion and other forms of applied creativity.
Klat Magazine is a publication registered at the Milan Tribunal (no. 197, April 24, 2009). The editor-in-chief is Paolo Priolo.

Missing Soluch ( Ja-ye Khali-ye Soluch; 1979) is a novel by Iranian author Mahmoud Dowlatabadi, translated from the Persian by Kamran Rastegar in 2007. It was shortlisted for the 2008 Best Translated Book Award.
Dowlatabadi wrote it in just 70 days, after he was released from prison, having composed it in memory while in jail. It was the first novel of the author written in the everyday language of the people, Persian, and was hugely influential at the time of Revolutionary Iran for its sympathetic depiction of the proletariat, which was new in modern Iranian literature. It was Dowlatabad's first novel to be translated into English (2007).
The novel depicts rural village life in a fictional town in northern Iran in the 1960s, a time when many people from the countryside were moving to cities. The main character is Mergan, a woman whose husband, Soluch, has left without a word, leaving behind two boys and a girl. The novel shows what happens as Mergan's family falls prey to the everyday calamities of the poor such as theft, starvation and violence, paralleling the demise of the village to the forces of modernity. Translator Kamran Rastegar wrote an essay about the novel called "Reading Missing Soluch in the U.S.: Treating Mahmoud Dowlatabadi's Ja-ye Khali-ye Soluch as art rather than political metaphor". He says that "Dowlatabadi delicately attempts to trace the significant changes to rural life in Iran over the course of one generation in the mid-twentieth century."
Ben Lytal of the New York Sun praised it, claiming that it was the one book from 2007 that he most wanted to recommend. Elham Gheytanchi in Words Without Borders says "..that Dowlatabadi has created a masterpiece; a story of poverty-stricken villagers whose feelings and fears leave us anguished because their fears capture our imagination, our existential doubts about the meaning of life and death." Publishers Weekly called it "a stark but engrossing portrait of contemporary rural Iran.. The story is relentless, but beautifully and incisively rendered, and imbued throughout with hope."

He was elected as a member of the Flemish Parliament in 1995 and reelected ever since. He has been floor leader for N-VA between 2004 and 2007 and between 2009 and 2012. He was elected Speaker of the Flemish Parliament on 18 June 2019 but had to resign as Speaker due to the fact that he was caught drunk driving and because he was accused P-magazine which reported on 11 July 2019 that Mr Van Dijck connived to commit fraud together with a sex worker. Van Dijck denies the accusations of fraud.
He was first elected to the Municipal Council of Dessel in 1989 and has been mayor of the town between 1995 and 2000 and again since 2007. N-VA has an absolute majority in the Municipal Council since the 2006 elections, even increased after the 2012 elections.

He was caught drunk driving in July 2019 after causing an accident involving a parked trailer. Subsequently he tried to downplay the seriousness of this infraction by saying “I haven't committed any crime”.
He was fully intending on staying in office after this. However after accusations of fraud involving tax-money and prostitutes - claims he says are ungrounded - he decided to resign on 11 July. Three months later, the deontological committee of the Flemish Parliament decided that Van Dijck had not made a deontological mistake.

The Star Gold Coast (formerly Jupiters Hotel and Casino) is a casino and hotel located in the suburb of Broadbeach on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. The casino, which was Queensland's first, is situated next to the Nerang River and is operated by Star Entertainment Group. It opened in November 1985 as Conrad Jupiters. In 2017 it was rebranded as The Star, Gold Coast.
One per cent of the casino's gross gaming revenue is deposited in the Gambling Community Benefit Fund. This fund was established in 1987, supports non-profit community-based groups and is administered by the Government of Queensland.
The seven acre complex includes eight bars, seven restaurants, conference facilities, a ballroom, theatre, health spa and gym. The hotel, with 592 rooms, stands 66 metres (216 feet) and has 21 floors. The complex is governed under the Jupiters Casino Agreement Act.
Theatre
Jupiters Theatre underwent a $20 million makeover and expansion and re-opened in June, 2012. The redevelopment of the theatre resulted in the capacity more than doubling to accommodate 2,000 seated or 2,300 general admission guests and the theatre viewing experience will be improved through state-of-the-art technologies and architecture.
The theatre redevelopment includes the creation of a balcony level with up to 300 seats, VIP Hospitality rooms for pre- and post-event functions, new bars on the balcony and orchestra level, new toilets on the balcony and orchestra level, purpose built integrated movie projection booth, multi-purpose mechanical thrust stage, the enhancement of disability access to all areas, and increased dressing room space.
In 2008, Jupiters ceased producing shows in-house and now presents international shows such as Mother Africa, ABBA Revival, Burn The Floor, Dance of Desire, and STOMP.
History
Conrad Jupiters Casino opened on 22 November 1985 with 10,000 people in attendance, formally known as Conrad International Hotel and Jupiters Casino. Originally operated by Conrad Hotels and Jupiters Limited, the asset was included in the November 2003 merger of Jupiters with Tabcorp In April 2010 it was rebranded as Jupiters Hotel & Casino. In 2011 it became part of Echo Entertainment Group when Tabcorp listed its casino assets.
Jupiters Hotel & Casino made headlines in 1995 when then Brisbane Broncos Rugby League player Julian O'Neill urinated on the carpet under a black jack table on two separate occasions. Both Jupiters Hotel & Casino and the Treasury Casino in Brisbane were used for money laundering by welfare recipients on behalf of organised crime syndicates, from May 2006 to November 2007.
Between 1993 and 2001, the casino was defrauded of $5.7 million when corrupt casino staff and food suppliers fabricated food orders and invoices. In 2009, a court heard that senior management tried to prevent a proper investigation and that the police major fraud squad became involved in 2003.
In 2008, security staff at the casino and other venues took part in a trial of head mounted cameras which were worn over the ear. The devices were used to record video and audio evidence of incidents and raised privacy concerns due to a lack of laws regarding their use. In 2009, Office of Gaming acting executive director Barry Grimes criticised the casino's internal controls and procedures relating to excluded persons gaining entry to the casino.
2006 renovations
The complex underwent renovations in 2006. $53 million was spent on refurbishment of the casino. The two gaming floors are now one and the size is just over double of what it was. Level Two became the brand new Gold Clubroom. A new restaurant, balconies, and two new bars were included in the renovation. By 2008, 442 of the hotel rooms were completely refurbished at the cost of $16 million. The hotel front office and lobby bar were also renovated.
2017 expansion
In August 2015, work commenced on a $345 million redevelopment of the casino including the construction of a 17-storey tower.

The 2012 Dubai World Cup was a horse race held at Meydan Racecourse on Saturday 31 March 2012. It was the 17th running of the Dubai World Cup.
The winner was Godolphin's Monterosso, a five-year-old bay entire horse trained in Dubai by Mahmood Al Zarooni and ridden by Mickael Barzalona. Monterosso's victory was the first in the race for his jockey and trainer and the fifth for Godolphin.
Monterosso had been trained in England by Mark Johnston in 2009 and 2010, winning five races including the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. In 2011 he was transferred to the Godolphin stable and sent to compete in Dubai where he won the Dubai City of Gold and finished third to Victoire Pisa in the Dubai World Cup. In the 2012 World Cup he started a 20/1 outsider and won by three lengths from his more fancied stable companion Capponi with the British-trained Planteur half a length back in third. The 5/4 favourite So You Think finished fourth of the thirteen runners.

Ramage and the drum beat, later republished as Ramage and the drumbeat and as Drumbeat is an historical novel by Dudley Pope, set during 1796 and 1797 amongst the naval warfare of the French Revolutionary Wars. It is the second of the Ramage novels, following on from Ramage. During the book, Ramage becomes an integral part of ensuring British readiness for the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797).
Plot
The book follows Lieutenant Nicholas Lord Ramage and his experiences commanding the cutter HMS Kathleen. Dispatched by Commodore Horatio Nelson to carry messages to Gibraltar while transporting the Italians refugees rescued in Ramage. During the voyage, the Marchesa and Ramage exchange rings through a faked shooting competition. Soon the Kathleen encounters the crippled Spanish frigate, La Sabina. Deciding that it would be imprudent to leave the hulk drifting at sea, he forces the ship to surrender to his far inferior armed ship by demonstrating that he has the means to blow the stern off the immobile ship. He takes La Sabina in tow.
Soon after, two British frigates encounter Kathleen and remove the prisoners from the hulk in tow. The captain of one of the ships also takes charge of the Marchesa, to the great reluctance of Ramage and herself. Soon after, Ramage and the hulk drift into a Spanish fleet returning to the port of Cartagena, Spain. Though Kathleen is captured, Ramage, with the help of Jackson, passes himself off as an American sailor pressed by the British, and receives liberty from the Spanish. While in Cartagena (with other foreign and non-foreign refugees from Kathleen who had fake Protections) Ramage spies on the Spanish admiral José de Córdoba, stealing several official documents from his house. From this Ramage learns that the Spanish fleet will soon sail for the Atlantic. Realizing the danger of the situation, he steals a xebec and returns to Gibraltar, where he finds the recaptured Kathleen. The Commissioner of the port then sends Ramage to find Sir John Jervis and warn him of the battle. After a squall, he encounters the fleet, which quickly proceeds to Cape St. Vincent where they fight the Spanish fleet on 14 February 1797, Kathleen acting as a support ship for Lord Nelson. Entangled in the battle, Ramage and Kathleen become integral in the fouling of aboard San Jose, allowing Nelson in to come into battle. The British fleet is victorious, capturing four ships, and Ramage nearly dies from a wound which knocks him into the sea. However, he is rescued by several of his sailors, but gains no credit for his role in the battle.
Characters
Fictional
Nicholas Ramage - lieutenant and commander of the cutter HMS Kathleen
Gianna the Marchesa di Volterri - an Italian noblewoman who fled from the French conquest of the Italian kingdoms in Ramage and lover of Lieutenant Ramage.
Count Antonio Pitti - a cousin of the Marchessa di Volterri
Thomas Jackson - Ramage's American coxswain; possesses a genuine American Protection certificate exempting him from British Navy service, but chooses to remain with Ramage out of loyalty and helps other crewmen pass as Americans, including:
Will Stafford - a London-born crewman who was a locksmith and occasional housebreaker before being pressed into the Navy; enables Ramage to burgle Admiral de Córdoba's house.
Alberto Rossi - a Genoese crewman who is fiercely loyal to both Ramage and the Marchesa; like Jackson and Stafford, becomes a recurring character throughout the remainder of the series.
James Maxton - a West Indian crewman from Belmont, Grenada; stated to be exceptionally skilled with either a machete (owing to his upbringing cutting sugar-cane) or a Navy cutlass, also becomes a recurring character.
Sven Jensen - a Danish prize-fighter; killed in action when boarding the San Nicholas. Implied to be able to knock a man senseless with one punch, but this ability is never used in the story.
Real
Sir John Jervis - commander of the British fleet out of Gibraltar
Horatio Nelson - sympathizer with Ramage and commodore of a British squadron

HMS Kathleen - cutter armed with 10 x 6 lb carronades

Critical reception
Booklist called it "Another rousing tale of the sea ...", while The New York Times declared "Not even C.S. Forester knows more about the routine and battle procedures of the British Navy in the days of Nelson." Kirkus Reviews reported that "Mr. Pope is as good at detail as Ramage is at tactics and it's for those who like their cutlasses sharp and their romance romantic."

E. H. Gibbs settled in town in 1869 and became a prominent member of the community. He was a banker, real estate developer, founder of an insurance company, and a developer of a coal mine. He helped to bring the railroad to town, and founded the Oskaloosa Times and served as its first editor.
Builder
Gibbs hired Oskaloosa architect Wetherell to design the house, which was completed in 1903. It was the third large commission Wetherell had received in a three-year period; the other two being St. James Episcopal Church and the Oskaloosa Public Library. Known contemporaneously as "The Elms at Ridge Place," the two-story brick house replaced a frame house at the same location, which had been the family farm. The E. H. Gibbs house architecture demonstrated Wetherell's continued interest in neoclassical detailing, but was his first executed in brick. Wetherell relocated to Des Moines, Iowa three years after the house was completed.
Later use
The Gibbs family gave the house to neighboring William Penn University, where it was renamed Griffith Hall. It was used for offices and music rooms. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 13, 1991. The building has subsequently been torn down.

Imperivm: Great Battles of Rome (also known as Imperivm III: Great Battles of Rome, Imperivm RTC: Great Battles of Rome, or Imperium GBR) is a 2005 real-time strategy video game for Microsoft Windows. It is a sequel to the RTS/RPGs Celtic Kings: Rage of War and Imperivm II: The Punic Wars. The game, released in May 2005, was developed by Haemimont Games together with FX Interactive.
The game contains various civilizations to choose from, including Rome (Imperial and Republican), Egypt, Germania, Britannia, Iberia, Gaul, and Carthage. It also has a more elaborate hero system than its predecessors.
Gameplay
The game focuses on tactics, troop mobility and terrain topography rather than sheer strength of numbers for winning battles. Though resources are important, there is less relevance in gathering them than in other real-time battle games. Instead of sending an army of servants to mine, lumber, collect food or gather any other kind of resources these are generated at a constant rate directly proportional to the inhabitants of a population center.
There are 3 player modes to choose from:
Conquest: The battles involved on this game are focused on raising an empire by conquering all the known ancient world, the user can choose any of the available civilizations (see below) to do so.
Rome's Greatest Battles: A good amount of effort has been dedicated to historical accuracy; not only on the graphics but on the story line of this pre-built scenarios on which the player can live Rome's defining moments, from The Battle of Zama which marked the final and decisive end of the Second Punic War to the rebellion of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra.
Custom Game: These feature is always present in modern-day real time tactic and strategy games, it can be used to practice against computer opponents on custom made scenarios or to go on-line and battle against other human players
Civilizations
There are different civilizations to choose from, each with unique weakness and strengths: Egypt, Carthage, Republican Rome, Imperial Rome, Gallia, Germania, Hispania and Britannia.
Battles
Imperivm: Great Battles of Rome revives the battles which made Ancient Rome one of the great empire of the world, such as the Siege of Numantia, August victory against Mark Antony and Cleopatra in Egypt, Marcus Aurelius campaign against the Germans in the north of the Rhin river, Viriathus uprising in the West Iberian Peninsula and the Siege of Alesia led by Julius Caesar.
A special kind of unit called hero, which has become standard on Real-Time Strategy and Real-Time Tactic games, is used to group the different classes of soldiers under one command.
As a soldier builds up on experience he becomes more effective in combat.
By assaulting keeps a civilization can also gain access to loot like extra food or gold.
Heroes
Unlike normal military units, heroes are generally stronger and more valuable in battle. Their main strength lies in the ability to attach a group of up to 50 units, which from then on would follow their commands. When attached, the units receive part of the hero's experience as a bonus to their own. In addition, heroes arrange armies in specific formations that provide their units with an additional bonus when executing the stand ground command. Unlike units each hero has five skills that are unique to them and their civilization. These improve not only their individual combat abilities but also that of their army. Some of them are beneficial to the hero and the units attached to the hero. Other skills are beneficial to the units or help during battles.
Formations
There are four kinds of formations in the game: Square, Block, Line and Center Cavalry. Each gives different bonus. Usually the maximum number of units on an army is limited to 50 but in the case of Republican Rome this cap can be pushed up to 70.
Also, different formations favors mixes on soldiers classes quantities. For example; choosing a line formation would benefit an army composed of a majority of ranged attackers.
By grouping two or more Generals the size of an army can be effectively increased. Orders can be issued simultaneously to each General who in turn would relay them to their troops. Conveniently once that the positions of the joined armies have been set, the computer will make the best effort to keep the defined distance between groups.
This feature gives more possibilities since this allows specialization of groups. Each can choose the more convenient formation, for instance, two armies, one composed only from ranged attackers and the other of a good mix of melee troops, can choose line and block respectively.
As a unit gets to see more action his skill level increases; every unit has a level to reflect this, thus it is possible to get a favorable outcome when facing a numerically superior enemy with battle hardened troops, the most appropriate formation and some maneuvering.
Buildings and Population Centers
There are several classes of populations centers.
Villages
These population centers produce food at a constant rate. Each one has a population limit and current living people, depending on the completeness of population the production rate decreases or increases, also the people can be transferred to keeps or fortresses. Campaigning Troops can be supplied from these places though is much more useful to use scorched earth tactics to avoid defending a counterattack if the village is at the very end of the supply lines.
Walled City
The main establishment; this is where the player recruits troops, make most of the basic training for them and upgrade certain abilities. Every walled city has a tavern, a coliseum, a blacksmith, a temple for the gods and a certain class of town center. What varies, according to the civilization, is what can be obtained on those buildings.
Keeps
These are smaller than the walled city but play an important role by gathering resources as extra money or soldiers. Among them are: Gold Keep, Trading Keep and Training Keep.
The most obvious uses are as a forward base and defense point, keeps (no matter what class of keep) will attack any hostile nation party within certain range, but only when they have at least one occupant, the rate of fire can be increased by garrisoning more soldiers at the building but a line of supply must be established in order to keep alive the troops inside the fortification.
Gold Keep: Gold keeps can be used to increase the gold income for a particular civilization. When a building of this class has 2000 gold coins; it will generate more money, the player in possession of the keep can send the surplus money to his walled city to aid in his war effort. By keeping an average population above 85% in the walled city and one Gold Keep a player can support two medium-sized armies to aid in the expansion of his empire.
Trading Keep: These buildings are also useful to earn an extra income by means of selling food sent from a near village or walled city; the profits can be sent either to the walled city or be invested on a Gold Keep.
Training Keep: These building are useful to raise the skill level of regular troops, generals or mercenaries. By storing food inside the building troops garrisoned inside will increase their level, though just to a certain level cap.
Recruit Keep: In this building peasants are slowly turned into Level 1 Mace Warriors; these troops in turn can be sent to the training keep raising their level. Food is also required for this transformation.
Ruins
These are used to increase the power of your priest by performing rituals or they can contain powerful magic items that increase wielder's stats.
Liga Imperivm
Liga Imperivm is the online version of the game where players can chat and fight one against others. There are different ranks, and from lowest to highest punctuation, it is formed by slave, liberto, plebeian, patrician, decurion, centurion, praefectus, tribune, legatus, aedile, priest, magistrate, senator, censor, quaestor, praetor, consul, proconsul, governor and emperor.
In 2005, it organized the first Liga Imperivm championship, where players faced in a 1vs1 or 2vs2 duel. The winner got a trophy and €5000.
Reception
Great Battles of Rome received a "Double Platinum" award from the Asociación Española de Distribuidores y Editores de Software de Entretenimiento (aDeSe), for more than 160,000 sales in Spain during its first 12 months. During E3 2006 it was announced that the game sold more than 1 million copies and it became a Platinum title.
The Great Battles of Rome Imperivm HD Edition
In 2018 a group of developers, supported by FX, begun to work on a beta version of the game, which is currently available through the platform Steam. The new game is known within its largest community of active gamers as Imperivm III HD. A series of constant updates allows the game to feature: improved graphics (HD), new decorative and functional elements of maps, bugs and lag removal, balance of troops, new buildings, new unites, auto-update, new language available (English).
Imperivm GBR: Greek Civilization MOD
In 2016, the Italian team RattlesMake began an expansion of the game called Greek Civilization MOD with all the changes belonged to Steam version (until version 1.54) and the introduction of a new civilization: Greek. The first version was released on September 1, 2017, until version 1.9 dated July 9, 2022. In September 2020, Greek Civilization MOD ended up in the viewfinder of FX so RattlesMake was forced to remove every track from the network of the mod because of a violation of Copyright.

The Hacienda is the current name for a hotel in Monterey County, California, that was completed in 1930 for use by William Randolph Hearst as temporary housing for his employees and guests and headquarters for activities taking place on the surrounding land. The lodge building, designed by architect Julia Morgan, replaced and expanded upon an earlier wooden structure known as the Milpitas Ranch House which was destroyed by fire in the 1920s. The 1930 hotel has also been known as Milpitas Hacienda, Hacienda Guest Lodge and Milpitas Ranchhouse, under which name the property was placed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1977.
The lodge includes a restaurant, a lounge, a cantina, offices, public assembly rooms, guest rooms, a swimming pool and a tennis court. Hearst sold the structure and its surrounding property to the United States Army in 1940 for use as a training facility. The land and buildings were established by the Army as Fort Hunter Liggett. Today, the Army owns the building and a concessionaire operates it as a public hotel within the military base.
History
The fertile valley surrounding The Hacienda was documented by Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolà in 1769. Based on his recommendation, Father Junípero Serra established Mission San Antonio de Padua in the valley in 1771, and it thrived. Of all the California missions, San Antonio de Padua converted the highest number of Native Americans, peaking at 1,300 Salinan converts in 1805. In the 1830s, the mission was secularized and its holdings were divided into at least ten land grants (including Rancho Milpitas, or Little Corn Fields Ranch) given to soldiers and civilians supportive of Mexican government. English-speaking settlers began arriving in significant numbers in 1849 with the discovery of gold in California. Nearby Jolon was established as a gold mining town on an old Salinan village site in 1860, astride El Camino Real, the old road connecting all the Spanish missions in California.
Hearst
At the beginning of the 20th century, gold mining had petered out and Hearst began buying up property in the area. Over the next two decades, he amassed land holdings covering the entirety of four of the ten Mexican land grants and most of Jolon. On top of the old Rancho Milpitas main ranch house site, at the edge of a small bluff less than a mile from and overlooking the old mission, Hearst hired Morgan to build a new ranch headquarters. Construction on the Mission Revival-styled building complex began in 1929, using poured concrete instead of adobe. A smoothly domed north tower was built in Moorish Revival style above the main living quarters. Original plans for the building were for it to include housing for 20 employees but this was expanded to 30 during construction. A proposed southern wing for Hearst's private quarters was never completed. Materials were carried from Santa Cruz in a Fageol truck. Construction costs totaled $200,000.
The building was not originally supplied with electricity. Wires for a single telephone line were run from Hearst Castle away. Wood stoves and fireplaces supplied heat, candles and lanterns provided light, and a well near the San Antonio River fed a cistern positioned a short distance uphill to the east to supply water pressure for a modern plumbing system. Those staying at The Hacienda year-round included the ranch manager, mechanics, gardeners, cooks and a ranch foreman who supervised cowboys tending cattle and farmhands harvesting wheat, barley, oats and alfalfa.
Hearst's guests could drive in, fly in and land at an adjacent landing strip, or they could arrive by horseback after a full day's ride from San Simeon. Guests included Spencer Tracy, Dick Powell, Will Rogers, Clark Gable, Herbert Hoover, Jean Harlow, Leslie Howard and Errol Flynn. Hearst's paramour, Marion Davies, stayed in one of the four tower suites when she visited. Californio-style fiestas were thrown in the guests' honor, complete with mariachis playing from the dining room balcony.
Although hunting in the area was enjoyed by sportsmen both before and after Hearst's ownership, Hearst did not allow any hunting on his property, and the California State Military Museum has concluded that The Hacienda was not built as a hunting lodge. Other observers have described the building as Hearst's hunting lodge.
Army
On December 12, 1940, Hearst sold , including the old Milpitas Ranch, to the United States government. Neighboring landowners sold another to form a training base for the War Department. The US Army used The Hacienda as housing for the base commander, for visiting officers and for the officers' club.
In 1957, a serviceman named Bill Runyan painted heroic murals depicting Spanish settlement of the area on selected interior walls of The Hacienda. Runyan started the large murals when he was a soldier at the fort but stayed on as a civil service carpenter to complete the task. Smaller ornamental paintings in the hotel date from the Hearst decade and were touched up or repainted by the Army.
National Park Service study
In November 1999, Congress authorized a study of Fort Hunter Liggett partly in response to a 1995 recommendation made by a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission which listed certain structures within the base as excess to the Army's needs. In 2004, the National Park Service (NPS) released an environmental assessment draft which identified for further study the Julia Morgan-designed Milpitas Hacienda complex including the swimming pool, tennis court and outbuildings as well as a number of other historic structures on the base and in the area. The NPS wrote that inclusion of the Milpitas Hacienda in the national park system would offer an opportunity to enhance visitor experience and expand their understanding of the lives and work of Morgan and Hearst. The NPS described the Milpitas Hacienda as representing the themes "expressing cultural values" and "developing the American economy" for its connection to Hearst and his media empire. Two alternatives were put forward: one where no action would be taken, and one where title to the Milpitas Hacienda and nearby bungalows would be transferred to California State Parks to be managed as an addition to the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument.
The US Army sent NPS a letter on May 27, 2005, stating that the BRAC property was no longer excess to the Army and was now required in order to support the Army's mission. This reversal in status for The Hacienda caused the NPS to re-evaluate its study of title transfer and management options, and to cease environmental assessment. On September 19, 2006, NPS submitted to Congress its final report which concluded that a number of national resources in and around Fort Hunter Liggett including the Milpitas Hacienda complex were suitable for inclusion in the national park system but that such an action was not currently feasible because none of the land or buildings were excess to the Army's needs. The NPS encouraged the Army "to continue its protection and management of the natural and cultural resources in a manner that retains their national significance."
Today, the United States Army Reserve operates the base, and a civilian concessionaire is allowed to run The Hacienda as a hotel open both to the public and to the military. Visitor access to the base, the hotel and the old Spanish mission is monitored through an Army checkpoint.

Ernest & Bertram is a 2002 tragic comedy short film written and directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker and actor Peter Spears.
The film spoofs Sesame Street characters Ernie and Bert. The film is based on Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour, and depicts Bert and Ernie after they are outed by Variety magazine. Although the film was a success at the Sundance Film Festival and the U.S Comedy Arts Festival, it kept from further distribution when Sesame Workshop served the film's producers with a cease and desist order for copyright violation.
Synopsis
When the film starts, Miss Piggy has discontinued a romantic relationship with Bert when rumors of the roommates being gay hit the media. After Ernie arrives home, the two converse, and upon learning of the break-up, reveals that he does love Bert "that way." Bert seems not to share this sentiment, resulting in Ernie's suicide.

Yongzin (, ) (www.yongzin.com) is the first search engine of Tibetan language in the world. It went live in August 2016, at a cost of 23 million yuan ($3.6 million) from a location in Gonghe County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China.
'Yongzin' is a Tibetan word. The first meaning is 'teacher'. The second meaning (by dividing the word into two characters) is 'to acquire comprehensively'.
Yongzin is developed by the Tibetan Language Information Technology Research Center of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. This project is started from April 2013, and it belongs to the 'Tibetan language informationization construction' project, which is a part of the 12th five-year plan for the ethnic minorities of Qinghai Province.
According to a testing in 2016, the search engine censored some Tibetan words, including "Free Tibet", "Dalai Lama" and even "Tibetan tea".
At beginning, Yongzin has eight parts: news (གསར་འགྱུར།), webpage (དྲ་ངོས), image (པར་རིས།), video (བརྙན་རིས།), audio (གླུ་དབྱངས།), encyclopedia (རིག་མཛོད།), library (ཡིག་ཚང་།) and know (དྲིས་ལན།). Yongzin intends to build the biggest Tibetan digital library in the world, and develop software for Tibetan-language users.
In August 2020, Yongzin released a upgraded search engine app, which adopted an AI-based Tibetan word segmentation system. Yongzin also released an input method software supporting Tibetan, Chinese and English.

Kasper Fisker Jensen (; born 22 May 1988) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.
Predominantly a central midfielder, Fisker started his career at local Superliga-side Randers FC before spending two seasons at Skive IK, first on loan and since on a permanent deal. He signed for Hobro IK in 2009, where he helped the team reach successive promotions from the third to the first tier while establishing himself as one of the best midfielders in the Danish 1st Division, which resulted in him winning 1st Division Player of the Year in 2013. Fisker returned to Randers in January 2014, playing three years for his childhood club before moving to Brøndby IF in 2017 where he won the Danish Cup in his first season. He retired in March 2021 as part of Fremad Amager.
Club career
Randers
Born in Nørager, Norddjurs Municipality, Fisker played as a youth for local football club Nørager Boldklub, before joining Randers Freja, a feeder club for Randers FC, at the age of 12. After having progressed through the Randers Freja youth system, Fisker was promoted to the Randers FC first team in January 2005. He made his debut against Vejle Boldklub two years later, before moving to Skive IK on loan in July 2007, having played only the one match for the first team in Randers. Eventually, he signed a permanent deal with the club after his loan spell had ended in December 2007. However, he would mainly play for the Skive second team who were competing in the Danish Series 1, the sixth tier of the Danish football league system and the second-highest tier of the regional DBU Jutland association.
Hobro
2009–2011
After two seasons in Skive, Fisker signed a one-year contract with Hobro IK on 29 June 2009, a club which at that time competed in the Danish 2nd Division, the third tier of the Danish football league system. The deal was signed after he had spent six months on loan at Hobro from Skive. Fisker helped Hobro reach promotion to the Danish 1st Division, the second national tier, in his first season at the club, scoring a crucial goal against B.93 in one of the promotion play-off games. During the season, Fisker mainly played as a winger.
As his contract expired in June 2010, Fisker had initially agreed to a contract with Viborg FF, but eventually chose to sign a one-year contract extension with Hobro. He helped Hobro stay in the league in the 2010–11 season, as the club finished 12th in the league table; 3 points from Kolding FC in the relegation spots. As a result, Fisker's contract was extended until December 2013.
2011–2014
In the 2011–12 season, Fisker and Hobro sought once more to consolidate themselves in the second tier. An injury in January 2012 on the account of a hyperextended knee, kept him out for the start of the spring season. The club, however, managed to avoid relegation comfortably by ending in eight place in the league table, six points from FC Roskilde in the relegations spots.
The following season, Hobro struggled after a strong start to the season, eventually ending in ninth place, only one point from Fisker's former team Skive IK in the relegation spot. Fisker finished the season with six goals in 27 appearances.
Fisker played six more months for Hobro, after having agreed to a contract with Randers FC beginning as of January 2014. He had a strong finish to his career in the club, helping Hobro to first place in the table by the winter break, while personally winning 1st Division Player of the Year for 2013.
Return to Randers
2014–2015
Fisker signed with childhood club Randers FC in July 2013, with a contract beginning from January 2014, marking his return to the club since leaving them in December 2007. He signed a two-year contract. On 23 February 2014, Fisker made his first appearance for Randers since returning, starting in a 1–1 draw in the Superliga match against Viborg FF. He quickly established himself in the first team following strong outings and goals against F.C. Copenhagen and FC Vestsjælland during the spring of 2014. In the former, he secured a 1–1 draw for Randers. He scored two goals in his first half season in the club and made 15 total appearances, as Randers ended seventh in the league table after a strong finish to the season.
In March 2015, Fisker signed four-year contract extension with Randers and stated that he hoped to continue playing top-flight football for the club for years to come. He finished the season with 30 appearances in which he scored one goal, as the club ended fourth in the league table and thereby secured a place in the first qualifying round of the Europa League in the following season.
2015–2016
Fisker missed the start of the 2015–16 season and his European debut against Andorran side UE Sant Julià due to a pulled calf muscle. He made his comeback in a 2–3 loss to rivals AGF on 2 August, where he came on as a substitute in the 80th minute but was sent off six minutes later after elbowing Danny Olsen. His mixed start to the season continued and he was benched for a number of matches after his suspension, before making his return as a starter in a 6–0 win over Danish fourth tier club FC Sønderborg in a Danish Cup matchup on 24 September, in which he scored two goals. In the league, Fisker made his return as a starter on 3 October in a win over his former club Hobro. He continued as a starter for Randers in their first game after the winter break, a 1–1 draw against SønderjyskE on 27 February 2016, marking his only third start of the season. After the game, Randers head coach Colin Todd praised Fisker for his ambition, noting that he had seen a reaction from Fisker after having been sidelined for large parts of the first half of the season. Personal drama marked the Randers first team during large parts of the spring season, after Jonas Borring's wife, Kira Egsgaard Borring, had left the latter after becoming involved with Christian Keller, who had that point was club captain for Randers. As a result, Borring left the club after stating that Keller had "completely stabbed me in the back." Later, Keller was suspended from the team. Talking about the episode, Fisker stated that "[w]e are not affected by what has happened outside the pitch. On the contrary, we have been bound together. We've talked a lot about what's happened. It has almost worked as a form of team building." Despite the tumultuous season, Randers finished sixth in the league table, while Fisker made 24 total appearances in which he scored four goals.
2016–2017
In August 2016, Fisker signed a five-year contract, extending his deal which ran to 2019 another two years. He played a key role for Randers during the 2016–17 season under new head coach Ólafur Kristjánsson, who had replaced outgoing manager Colin Todd prior to the season. Fisker finished the season with 38 total appearances in which he scored two goals, as Randers ended seventh in the league table and were knocked out by FC Midtjylland in the European play-off final by losing 0–3.
Brøndby
2017–2019
On 26 June 2017, Fisker joined Brøndby IF in a deal worth DKK 2.5 million, signing a three-year contract. He made his debut for Brøndby on 13 July in the UEFA Europa League play-off round first leg home against VPS of Finland, a 2–0 win. On 10 May 2018, Fisker made an appearance as Brøndby beat Silkeborg IF 3–1 in the 2017–18 Danish Cup final.
A foot injury suffered during the 2018–19 season ruled Fisker out for 10–12 weeks. He finished an injury-affected 2018–19 season with 10 league appearances and no goals.
2019–2020
Fisker made his comeback for Brøndby on 11 July 2019, coming on as a substitute in the first leg of their UEFA Europa League qualification round against Finnish club Inter Turku in which he scored off a deflection in a 4–1 win. On 25 August, in a 3–0 defeat against AGF, Fisker suffered a cruciate ligament tear and was substituted in the first half. The injury resulted in him being ruled out for an extended period of time which cast a doubt on whether he would be offered a contract extension, as it was set to expire in June 2020. Fisker, as a result of the speculation, stated that he did not want to be pitied, and that he still expected to return for one more match. Due to the temporary suspension of the 2019–20 Superliga season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark, chances of him making a comeback increased and finally, on 26 May 2020, Fisker made his return in a friendly against Hvidovre IF. On 10 July, he made his official comeback in the Superliga to a standing ovation from Brøndby's fans in a 4–0 home win over FC Nordsjælland. On 21 July, Brøndby's director of football Carsten V. Jensen revealed that Fisker would be leaving the club at the end of the Superliga campaign.
Fremad Amager
On 22 August 2020, Fisker signed with Danish 1st Division (second-tier) club Fremad Amager, a signing which was announced on the club's Twitter account. He made his debut for the club a week later, on 1 September, in a 3–1 Danish Cup win over B.1908.
On 17 March 2021, Fisker announced his retirement from football due to recurring knee issues.
Style of play
Throughout his career, Fisker has mainly played as a central midfielder, although he was also employed as a winger during his tenures at Hobro IK and Randers FC. Despite not being particularly tall, he is a physically strong, consistent, aggressive, and hard-tackling midfielder, with an extremely high work rate, which eventually caught the eye of German manager Alexander Zorniger at Brøndby IF. Practicing the defensive tactic of Gegenpressing, Fisker's aggressive style, combined with an excellent positional sense, good anticipation and a strong left foot, was strongly suited for the team's style of play.
Personal life
While playing amateur football at Hobro IK, Fisker owned a hostel in his home town, Nørager.
Since 2015, Fisker has been married to blogger Stephanie Bak after proposing to her on a holiday in Jamaica. The couple have two children, Elva and Baldur.
In 2020, as Fisker was recovering from injury, he told in an interview with Spillerforeningen, the union for professional footballers in Denmark, that he had been prescribed antidepressants and sleep medicine during his injury.

Richard Joseph Riordan (born May 1, 1930) is an American investment banker, businessman, lawyer, and former Republican politician who was the 39th Mayor of Los Angeles, from 1993 to 2001. Born in New York City and raised in New Rochelle, New York, he served in the United States Army during the Korean War before becoming a lawyer and investor in Los Angeles, eventually specializing in private equity.
In 1993, he was elected mayor of Los Angeles and was re-elected in 1997. In 2002, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of California, losing the Republican primary. After leaving politics, he continued to work in business. , he is the most recent Republican to have been mayor of Los Angeles.
Early life, education, and career
Riordan, an Irish-American, was born in Flushing, Queens, and raised in New Rochelle, New York. Riordan graduated with an A.B. in philosophy from Princeton University in 1952 after completing a senior thesis titled "A Study of the Thomistic Faculty Psychology." He then received a J.D. from Michigan Law School in 1956. He moved to Los Angeles to begin work as an attorney for the downtown law firm of O'Melveny & Myers in 1956, leaving in 1959 to become a partner of Nossaman LLP. Riordan was a founding partner of the law firm Riordan & McKinzie in 1975. In 1982, Riordan was a founder of the private equity firm Riordan, Lewis & Haden.
Mayor of Los Angeles
When Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley announced his retirement, Riordan's interest turned to the 1993 mayoral election. On election day, Riordan won, 54%–46%, becoming the first Republican mayor in over thirty years. Many of his proposals were blocked by the heavily Democratic City Council or proved simply unfeasible in reality; for example, the police academy did not have enough classroom space and instructors to train as many new police officers as Riordan had initially promised. He streamlined certain business regulations and established "one-stop" centers around the city for functions such as permit applications. He feuded with police chief Daryl Gates' successor, former Philadelphia police commissioner Willie Williams, but oversaw a general decline in crime. (In 1997, Riordan replaced Williams with LAPD veteran Bernard Parks.) That year, he was re-elected against California State Senator Tom Hayden.
Riordan's tenure was marked by a controversy over the massive cost overruns occurring during the construction of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Red Line subway. At the same time, a previously little-known group called the Bus Riders Union sued the city – on the basis of racial discrimination – over diversion of funds from buses to Red Line construction, and managed to force it into a ten-year consent decree in 1996 that eviscerated MTA funding for the construction of subway and light rail projects. Riordan has publicly regretted having signed the consent decree and counts it as the biggest mistake of his mayoral tenure.
Riordan was succeeded in 2001 by James Hahn after becoming the first Mayor of Los Angeles to be term-limited out of office; it was Riordan who spearheaded the city's term limit ballot initiative, prior to becoming mayor. In the mayoral primary election that year, Riordan had endorsed his advisor and friend Steve Soboroff. Soboroff came in third in the nonpartisan race, and Hahn and former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa advanced to the runoff. In the runoff election, Hahn defeated Villaraigosa, whom Riordan endorsed for the second round of balloting. Villaraigosa would go on to beat Hahn in a 2005 rematch for Mayor.
2002 California gubernatorial race
In 2002, Riordan, a moderate Republican, decided to seek the governorship. He was opposed in the Republican primary election by conservative businessman Bill Simon and former California Secretary of State Bill Jones. Although he led early in the race by over 30%, he eventually lost to Simon by 18%. Riordan was hampered by a conservative Republican party base that rejected his appeal to move the party toward the center.
Governor Gray Davis' campaign spent millions of dollars running attack ads against Riordan, essentially helping the Simon campaign. Davis felt that he had a much better chance against the conservative Simon than the moderate Riordan and that the move was worth the risk. Riordan lost the primary, and Davis went on to defeat Simon 47%–42% in the general election.
The Los Angeles Examiner
In early 2003, Riordan began circulating a prototype of a weekly newspaper he intended to begin publishing that June. The Los Angeles Examiner was intended to be a locally focused, sophisticated, and politically-independent publication. It was never published. Riordan put the project on hold when he was appointed as state secretary for education by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a position he held from 2003 until his resignation in 2005.
Involvement in city politics since 2000
In the 2001 Los Angeles mayoral election, Riordan endorsed his friend and advisor Steve Soboroff in the primary and Antonio Villaraigosa in the general election. In 2005, he backed former State Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg in the primary and Antonio Villaraigosa in the general election. In both races, he chose not to endorse James Hahn.
Riordan has played a role in City Council elections, becoming a supporter of candidates Bill Rosendahl in 2005, Monica Rodriguez in 2007, and Adeena Bleich in 2009. Rosendahl won the election in the Eleventh District; Rodriguez lost to Seventh District Councilman Richard Alarcon and Bleich lost to Paul Koretz and David Vahedi who advanced to the runoff election. In 2013, Riordan endorsed mayoral candidate Wendy Greuel. Greuel was ultimately defeated by then-Council member Eric Garcetti.
Personal life and legacy
Riordan & McKinzie merged into Bingham McCutchen in 2003. Riordan is the owner of the Original Pantry Cafe in Los Angeles, which has been in operation since 1924. He also owns Gladstones Malibu which has been open since 1972. The Richard J. Riordan Central Library is named after him.

Charles Christian Hornbostel (September 26, 1911 – January 13, 1989) was an American middle-distance runner. He made two Olympic finals at 800 meters and once tied the world record at 880 yards.
Career
As a sophomore at Indiana University, Hornbostel won the 800 meters at the 1932 NCAA Championships in a meeting record time of 1:52.7. As the NCAA Championships were simultaneously an early Olympic tryout meet, he qualified for the Olympic Trials in Stanford, where he placed second behind Edwin Genung and qualified for the team. At the Olympics in Los Angeles Hornbostel won his heat, running 1:52.4 and beating the eventual silver medalist, Alex Wilson of Canada. In the final he placed sixth, again running 1:52.7.
Hornbostel repeated as NCAA champion in 1933, beating mile champion Glenn Cunningham by inches as both clocked 1:50.9 for 880 yards. This equalled Ben Eastman's world record from the previous year. Two weeks later Cunningham beat Hornbostel at the national championships in 1:51.8 (800 m).
Hornbostel won the NCAA championship for a third and final time in 1934, this time in 1:51.9 (880 yards). At the Princeton Invitational, however, he was decisively beaten by Eastman, who ran 1:49.8 to break his own and Hornbostel's record. Hornbostel was some five yards behind in 1:50.7, also under the old record.
Hornbostel qualified for the Olympics again in 1936, placing second to eventual gold medalist John Woodruff at the Trials in 1:51.3. In the slow and tactical Olympic final Hornbostel finished fifth. After the Olympics he took part in two world-record-setting relays on the same day, running 4 x 880 yards in 7:35.8 and 4 x Mile in 17:17.2.
Prior to the Berlin Olympics, he earned an MBA from Harvard Business School

Buenos días, Isabel is a Venezuelan telenovela written by Cuban writer Delia Fiallo and produced by Venevisión in 1980.
Flor Núñez and José Bardina as the main protagonists.
Plot
Isabel is the kind of secretary every executive dreams of: she is efficient, intelligent, hardworking and reliable. But as a woman, she leaves much to be desired, as she is drab and insignificant. She has developed a shyness that was formed due to the influence of Lucrecia, her dominant and overprotective mother. Lucrecia is a religious fanatic that has made her daughter grow up with low self-esteem and a lack of interest in making herself attractive to men. Jose Manuel, Isabel's boss, is a handsome businessman who sees Isabel merely as an employee. Jose Manuel is a widower who has raised his daughter Maria Jesús with the help of his mother-in-law who is not impressed that he has already begun to forget her daughter's memory by seeking other women, and she is forced to endure the presence of Ligia, Jose Manuel's frivolous girlfriend. Isabel has feelings for Jose Manuel, but she cannot dare tell him about them.
Jose Manuel seems to be happy with Ligia, but what he doesn't know is that Ligia is bored with their relationship, and she cheats on him with her best friend's boyfriend. Jose Manuel soon discovers this deception, and devastated, he falls into depression. Ligia and her lover flee the city for fear of Jose Manuel's retaliation over the betrayal. In his sadness, Isabel tries her best to comfort Jose Manuel, and it is then that he begins to see the goodness and sweet nature of Isabel's heart, the secretary that he merely greeted every day with "Good morning, Isabel". But Jose Manuel makes the wrong decision and proposes to Isabel, not because he loves her but out of desperation, in an attempt to forget Ligia.
The two finally get married, but the next day, Jose Manuel regrets his decision. Heartbroken, Isabel flees his cruel treatment and goes in search of his mother. But the experience has turned Isabel into a strong young woman and not the shy, weak secretary. Seeing that she cannot be able to control Isabel any longer, Doña Lucrecia falls ill and dies. Through a friend's recommendation, Isabel travels out of the country. Meanwhile, Jose Manuel realizes that his secretary meant more to him than he wanted to admit, but seeing that Isabel isn't around, he decides to wait for his wife. Ligia comes back with an attempt to win Jose Manuel back, but she is only faced by rejection. When Isabel comes back, everyone is shocked to see her transformed into a well groomed, beautiful woman

The Duitsch-Vlaamsche Arbeidsgemeenschap (Dutch; "German-Flemish Working Group"), better known as DeVlag, was a small radical pro-Nazi organization active in Flanders during the German occupation of Belgium. It was founded in 1936 by academics Jef Van de Wiele and Rolf Wilkening as a cultural association, with the purpose of strengthening the exchange of students and professors between the universities of Leuven and Cologne.
Its membership reached hundreds by the late 1930s. In May 1941, after the German invasion, DeVlag started receiving financial backing from the SS, and was reorganized into a Nazi organization. This was first done in secrecy. German SS-Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger was later appointed as DeVlag's president, and the bond between the two organizations was thus made official.
DeVlag's orientation towards the SS brought it into a conflict with the Flemish National League (Vlaams Nationaal Verbond, VNV), the main collaborationist organization in German-occupied Flanders, which had originally supported the "cultural" activities of DeVlag. The VNV was a Flemish nationalist movement, which envisioned an independent Flanders, or perhaps Dietsland, in a German-dominated Europe, while Van de Wiele considered Dutch merely a German dialect and the Flemish people a part of the German race. DeVlag saw Dutch or Flemish nationalism as provincialism, and supported the outright annexation of Flanders into the Greater German Reich. The VNV also had partly clerical roots, while the SS ideology endorsed by DeVlag held anti-Christian notions. While DeVlag was supported by the SS, and worked closely with the Germaansche SS in Vlaanderen, the VNV received support from the Wehrmacht military occupation (Militärverwaltung) and from the head of the military government, Alexander von Falkenhausen.
Both groups competed to recruit members for the Waffen-SS although the VNV rapidly secured dominance within the Flemish Legion established in 1941. In 1943, when the VNV started its youth wing De Nationaal-Socialistische Jeugd in Vlaanderen ("National-Socialist Youth in Flanders"), DeVlag responded by setting up the Flemish wing of the Hitler Youth.
DeVlag reached the peak of 50,000 members in 1943. In late 1944, the Nazi leadership answered the demands of DeVlag by annexing Flanders and Wallonia into the German Reich, but this was more theoretical than actual, as Belgium had already been liberated by the advancing Allied forces. Van de Wiele was, however, given the title "National Leader of the Flemish people" (Landsleider van het Vlaamsche volk) and DeVlag was deemed by the Germans as the sole party representing the Nazi unity in Flanders.

After that development, Avner and Amos decide to delay it for some years. Disappointed, Roberto is co-operating with Lillie Dvir, Amos' wife, and these two operate the experiment on Amos and Lillie's kids, three-year-old Maya and Jonathan.

Amos is dying of cancer, so he decides urge his kids into adolescence – to the age of fifteen with his machine Turbo-Time, which can change your age, and changes their names to Aya and Nini. Avner raises a project for amnestied students and Amos is asking him to attach Aya and Nini to the project. Amos is flying to medical treatments in Switzerland, while Aya and Nini think he's dead.
Avner forms "The Octette" and recruits eight amnestied students to investigate the ripples. In addition to solving riddles and saving the countries and themselves from hostile forces, the octette is acting like a similar class with loves and friendships: Aya and Adam are in love at first sight. Nini and Roni and Mika and Avi are becoming couples too. Surprisingly, Lillie is coming back from abroad to raise her children.

Tel Burna is an Israeli archaeological site located in the Shephelah (Judean foothills), along the banks of Nahal Guvrin, not far from modern-day Qiryat Gat.
History
The site was primarily inhabited in the Bronze and Iron Ages, and was one of a series of sites along the border between Judah and Philistia in the Iron Age. The first excavations at the site were conducted in the summer of 2010, as part of a long term archaeological project, headed by Itzhaq Shai and Joe Uziel, affiliated with Bar Ilan University.
Tel Burna is located near Beit Guvrin/Maresha, Tel Goded, Lachish, Tell es-Safi/Gath and Tel Zayit. Due to its location, and its prominence in the Iron Ages, some have suggested identifying the site with Libnah, a site mentioned several times in the Bible, and noted to be one of the 13 Kohanic cities. Libnah had also revolted against the Kingdom of Judah in the 9th Century BCE () and where Hamutal, Queen of Judah in the 7th Century BCE was born ().
Survey results
An extensive archaeological survey was conducted at the site in June 2009. It was found that the site is approximately 100 dunams, with settlements in the Early Bronze Age II/III, Middle Bronze Age II, Late Bronze Age, Iron Age I and Iron Age II. The largest settlement at the site seems to date to the Iron Age II, when the summit was enclosed by fortifications, still visible on the surface today.
Excavation results
The excavations in 2010 revealed that the site's summit was not settled after the Iron Age. Remains uncovered include the Iron Age fortifications, living surfaces dating to the 9th Century BCE, and several silos dating to the 7th century BCE. If in fact the location of Libnah should be sought out at Tel Burna, the excavations thus far do conform to what is understood about the city from the Biblical texts. However, more recent work in 2013 has led the leader of the excavation, Itzhaq Shai, program director of the Tel Burna Excavation Project, to believe that Tel Burna is the site for the city of Libnah.

Blue Screen is a crime novel by Robert B. Parker, the fifth in his Sunny Randall series.
Plot summary
Sunny Randall is approached by Buddy Bollen to provide protection for his number one client, Erin Flint, star of the Woman Warrior movie series and future star of Bollen's major league baseball team.. Bollen's fears prove well founded when Erin's assistant, Misty, is murdered. Because of Misty's striking resemblance to her, Erin is convinced the killer was after her. Sunny meets Paradise Police Chief Jesse Stone at the scene of the crime; however Buddy and Erin lack confidence in the Paradise police, and ask Sunny to solve the crime.
Sunny talks to a sports writer who is convinced that Erin Flint's addition to Bollen's baseball team is a publicity stunt and that Erin will be able to compete with the male players in the major league. He proves to be right later when Erin faces a major league pitcher and cannot hit one ball.
Sunny discovers that Erin Flint is actually Ethel Boverini, and that she is still married to pimp Gerard Basgall. Sunny and an LAPD detective go to question Basgall, who admits to still being married to Erin and still loving her. Erin admits that she was one of Basgall's prostitutes, as well as his wife. She and Misty Tyler, who is really her sister Edith, began working for Basgall after their mother died.
Further investigation reveals that Buddy Bollen was looking for financing for his first Woman Warrior movie and found it in Boston mobster Moon Monaghan. L.A. film financier Arlo Delany had brokered the deal and provided Erin and Misty's sexual services for both Bollen and Monaghan.
Bollen decides to star Erin in his Woman Warrior movie. The movie turns out to be a big hit; however Buddy has Arlo cook the books to make it look like it made no money in order to stiff Moon Monaghan. Moon has Arlo killed as a warning to Buddy of what will happen if he doesn't get his money back. Misty gets scared and threatens to go to the police. Basgall gets into an argument with her and, during the struggle, accidentally breaks Misty's neck and kills her. Chief Stone and Sunny confront Erin and Gerard about this. Gerard claims that he killed Misty, while Erin claims that she killed her. Touched by the fact that the two try to protect the other by taking the blame, Chief Stone decides they have suffered enough and lets them go on the condition that they promise not to avenge her.
A subplot involves Sunny's budding relationship with Jesse Stone.

Sheep milk cheese is a cheese prepared from sheep milk. Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk.
Nutrition and production
Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content. Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, more lactose than cow milk, and is therefore not an alternative for people who are lactose intolerant.
Though sheep's milk may be drunk in fresh form, today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making. Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk. Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin. For the cheese to fully ripen takes at least two weeks; it can take between two and three months, and even up to two years.
By country
France

Hammer of the Gods is a 1994 turn-based strategy computer game developed by Holistic Design and published by New World Computing for DOS. The events of the game take place in Viking Age Europe, with a Norse fantasy setting. Hammer of the Gods is one of the games that spawned the creation of the Heroes of Might and Magic strategy series.
Gameplay
Hammer of the Gods is an empire-building game with a focus on military strategy. The goal of the game is to build an empire through expansionism while completing a set of goals that are specified by the gods of Norse mythology. The game is won when a player completes the quest of Odin, the highest god in the Norse pantheon. Upon starting the game, each player chooses to control one of four races: human, elf, troll, or dwarf. Each race has unique characteristics for military units, and each is presented with a different hierarchy of gods which set different goals to meet. When the player meets each of these goals, the gods will present the player with a reward at the end of that turn. These rewards vary in nature, and can include powerful military units, magical flying ships for fast transportation, or higher income from conquered towns, to name a few examples.
Before beginning the game, the player chooses one of two world map layouts. One choice is to play on a representation of Europe during the Viking golden age beginning in 700AD. The other is a computer-generated map, which will be different for each campaign started. Each player starts the game with control of one town, and must explore the world to conquer new towns for income and military security.
In addition to military conquest, players can manage diplomacy between their respective empires. Each player's relations are labelled as peaceful, neutral, or at a state of war. Trade can be initiated between empires with neutral or peaceful relations.
When two armies meet on the world map, a battlefield is displayed showing the player's and enemy's units. Player moves their units during their turns, with the goal of completely eradicating the enemy's units or forcing a retreat. Most units can only attack other units that are adjacent on the battlefield, but archers and wizards can attack from a distance. When a town or a castle is attacked, the defending player may have fortifications established, which can greatly influence the outcome of the battle.
Although the main gameplay consists of military conquest, the goal of each player is to meet goals set forth by the gods of the Norse Edda. Between turns, a tree representing the pantheon for each race is displayed, and the player chooses from available gods to try to meet their goals. Generally, the higher the god is on the tree, the more difficult the goal will be to accomplish. Some are very straightforward, such as "go to the ruins of Stonehenge and defeat the dragon there," while some are more complicated and require multiple turns to complete, such as requiring the player to conquer a number of towns.
Reception
The game was reviewed in 1995 in Dragon #221 by Jay & Dee in the "Eye of the Monitor" column. Jay gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the game 3 stars.

"Rock Bottom" was the entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, performed in English by Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran. It was also written and produced by de Paul and Moran and released on the Polydor record label. Originally it was written for the group Blue Mink; and submitted unbeknown to de Paul and Moran as an entry for A Song For Europe by the publishers and when it was selected, de Paul agreed to perform the song if Moran would join her. On 9 March 1977, "Rock Bottom" was selected to represent the UK at the A Song for Europe 1977 event held at the New London Theatre, presented by Terry Wogan.
The jaunty sing-a-long song says that when people are in a bad situation they should work to solve problems and not be pessimistic about tragedies. Apparently it represented the situation at the time; Eurovision 1977 was almost cancelled due to budget restrictions and it was delayed by five weeks due to a strike by cameramen and technicians. The BBC, who had to host the contest that year, did not give the song its whole-hearted support because it was the favourite to win the contest and, if it had won, then they would have to finance and host the 1978 contest, inspiring the plot used in the movie Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. Eurovision: Secrets & Scandals, a one hour long Channel 5 documentary, shown on 13 May 2022, also confirmed that the BBC was secretly relieved that "Rock Bottom" did not win because they definitely did not want to host the 1978 contest.
The song contest was planned to take place on 2 April due to the cameramen and technicians being on strike, but it was rescheduled and finally took place on 7 May. The song was performed ninth on the night, following 's Os Amigos with "Portugal no coração" and preceding 's Pascalis, Marianna, Robert & Bessy with "Mathima Solfege". At the close of voting, it had received 121 points, placing second in a field of 18 entries. Lionel Blair choreographed de Paul and Moran's piano seated performance, as he had done for the programme deciding the UK's entry that year. In an interview with Gala magazine, Marie Myriam, the contest winner stated that she loved "Rock Bottom".
It was preceded by "Save Your Kisses for Me" by Brotherhood of Man as the British representative at the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest and succeeded by Co-Co with "Bad Old Days" in 1978. De Paul was the last established and well-known international artist to enter the contest for the UK, until Scott Fitzgerald in 1988, and she was the first British entry to write and perform her own song.
"Rock Bottom" charted in several European countries, topping the charts in Switzerland, no. 2 in Austria, no. 4 in Germany, no. 6 in Sweden (no. 4 on the Poporama chart), no. 7 in Ireland and Norway, no.8 in Belgium and no. 10 in France and Israel. In the UK Singles Chart, it reached no. 19 but on the U.K. Juke Box Top 20 it reached no. 8. It also made no. 7 on the Europarade chart, no. 13 on the Radio Luxembourg Top 30. On the basis of sales from the record-buying public of Europe, it was the winning entry, outperforming the contest's winner, a quarter of a million copies being sold in Germany alone, where it was the 38th best selling single of 1977. After the Eurovision Song Contest, it was released as one of the tracks on an EP in Portugal entitled "Conjunto Pentagrama" ("Pentogram Set"), together with the French entry "L'Oiseau Et L'Enfant", the Irish entry "It's Nice To Be In Love Again" and the Monaco entry "Une Petite Française".
In a ranking by The Daily Telegraph of all of the UK's Eurovision Song Contest entries over the last 59 years, "Rock Bottom" came in at no. 9 and a year later they wrote "Not just a fun, honky-tonk tune, but also a rather memorable performance. Moran and de Paul were dressed in fetching Edwardian morning-suits, sat back-to-back playing a pair of duelling grand pianos." In an analysis of all Eurovision Song Contest songs that entered the German singles chart, it was ranked number 20, based on number of weeks on the chart and chart positions achieved. In 2021, PRS for Music revealed a top 20 of most played UK Eurovision entries and "Rock Bottom" was number 13.
The duo also recorded a German version of "Rock Bottom" called "Für Immer" with German lyrics by Marianne Rebesky, which also had healthy sales figures in German speaking countries, and this version was covered by the band Wir. De Paul and Moran's version of "Für Immer" appeared on the CD Greatest Hits - Lynsey de Paul. Instrumental versions of the song also appeared on James Last's album Auf Last Geht's Los. Other versions have been recorded by the Studio Group, Armi & Danny (Danny (Finnish singer), Jörgen Petersenin Orkesteri, Ted Weber, Brothers Of The World, Leni, Günter Noris, Inger Lise (Inger Lise Rypdal) & Stein (Stein Ingebrigtsen), Daniel Janin, Annette Klingenberg & Johnny Reimar, Bingos, and The Hiltonaires and, most recently by jazz guitarist Denny Wright.
The song has featured on Eurovision compilation albums such as This Is... Eurovision, Ultimate Eurovision Party!, Favoriet Van Follet - 18 Unieke Eurovisiesongs (18 unique Eurovision songs) and Stars Of Eurovision, as well as a number of de Paul's compilation CDs. It was also a track on the CD double album Die Ultimative Chart Show - Die erfolgreichsten Piano-Hits aller Zeiten in 2010, which made the Swiss and Austrian albums charts. In 2018, the song was one of 16 songs chosen as 1970s Eurovision classics on a specially released vinyl album that also featured ABBA, Brotherhood Of Man, Baccara, The New Seekers, Anne-Marie David and Gigliola Cinquetti. It was also included as a track on the 2021 album, Now That's What I Call Eurovision, which reached number one on the UK Official Compilations Chart.

Rex Andrew Sinquefield (; born September 7, 1944) is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist who has been called an "index-fund pioneer" for creating the first passively managed index fund open to the general public Sinquefield was also a co-founder of Dimensional Fund Advisors. He is active in Missouri politics, his two main interests being rolling back the income tax and increasing public funding for charter schools.
Early life and education
He had 18 cleft palate operations before age five. His father died when he was five years old. Because of the family's poverty, Sinquefield and his brother were placed in a local Catholic orphanage, the Saint Vincent Home for Children in St. Louis, Missouri. The school was run by strict German nuns who made the children sleep in big dormitories, wash the dishes, clean the rooms, and scrub the floors with steel wool. Sinquefield told the BBC that the school's regimentation taught him self-discipline. When they were teenagers, Sinquefield and his brother returned home to live with their mother, who he claims resented the city's 1% wage tax.
He graduated from Bishop DuBourg High School in 1962. He studied to be a priest at the Diocesan Seminary at Cardinal Glennon College in St. Louis. At the time, he owned $200 worth of one stock. During the Vietnam War, he served as a “high-end gopher” in the finance corps at Fort Riley, as he put it. Working with top-secret records, he found it “easy, boring, safe and a terrible waste of manpower.” He majored in business for his undergraduate degree from Saint Louis University and received an MBA from University of Chicago.
Career
Sinquefield worked at the American National Bank of Chicago, developing, in 1973, the first S&P 500 passively managed index fund. Seven years later, the fund managed $12 billion.
In May 1974, in the depths of the worst bear market since the 1930s, Sinquefield and Roger Ibbotson made a brash prediction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, floundering in the 800s at the time, would hit 9,218 in 1998 and 10,000 by November 1999. He was spot on.
Dimensional Fund Advisors
In 1981, Sinquefield and another University of Chicago teaching assistant, David Booth, co-founded Dimensional Fund Advisors, the first passive fund focused on small (microcap) companies customarily ignored in large institutional portfolios. As of June 30, 2018, it managed more than $582 billion in assets.
With Yale School of Management professor Roger G. Ibbotson, he co-wrote the 1989 book Stocks, Bonds, Bills and Inflation, a study of stock market returns.
Dimensional Fund Advisors' investment strategy has been said to create an optimal portfolio consisting of various funds that emulate the different style and size attributes of various securities markets worldwide so that one fund might behave like the S&P 500, another might correlate with just the value stocks in the S&P 500, while a third might emulate the performance of all small-cap stocks. Sinquefield is a proponent of passive investment, meaning that he believes you simply cannot beat the market.
In 2005, he retired from DFA because he was “bored” and returned to St. Louis, where he became involved in politics and philanthropy.
Politics
Show-Me Institute
On his return to St. Louis, Sinquefield co-founded the Show-Me Institute with R. Crosby Kemper III, a Kansas City banker. Based in Clayton, Show-Me is a think tank that commissions studies on public-policy issues. It has been labeled libertarian, conservative, and free-market. He is president of the institute, whose motto is “Advancing liberty with responsibility by promoting market solutions for Missouri public policy.”
Show-Me has successfully lobbied for a cable franchise reform bill and HB 818, which made Missouri the first state to let employers contribute pretax dollars to employees' health-savings accounts. Show-Me has also opposed governments' use of eminent domain.
Campaign contributions
Sinquefield became a major financial contributor to political campaigns of both political parties in Missouri politics after the Missouri legislature ended campaign finance limits in 2009. According to a 2015 Governing Magazine article, "big majorities" in both houses of the Missouri legislature have received campaign contributions from Sinquefield. He has particularly focused on altering public education, tax reform, and accountability in government.
He donated $1 million to Republican Bev Randles' 2016 campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Missouri and three quarters of a million to Kurt Schaefer, a Republican candidate for attorney general. Both candidates lost.
Sinquefield has also donated to Missouri candidates Shane Schoeller, Chris Koster, and Sarah Steelman, as well as to the 2016 gubernatorial campaign of Catherine Hanaway.
In 2014, he supported a ballot initiative to abolish teacher tenure in Missouri and he is a major funder of other groups and PACs, such as Pelopidas, LLC.
Rex and Jeanne are supporters of Senator Josh Hawley with significant contributions to his campaign in 2020. Sinquefield also donated to Mike Parson that year.
In 2021, Sinquefield donated $250,000 to two campaigns: Scott Fitzpatrick's bid for state auditor and Mike Kehoe's prospective candidacy for governor in 2024.
Tax policy activism
Many of Sinquefield's efforts in recent years have been focused on changing tax policy in Missouri. He advocates eliminating the state's income tax and replacing it with a more comprehensive sales tax. Sinquefield advocates replacing Missouri's and Kansas' income tax with a state sales tax on things like childcare, restaurants, and hotels.
Sinquefield also gave money to the group Kansans for No Income Tax which helped governor Sam Brownback lower the state income tax in 2012. Dubbed the Kansas experiment, this policy decreased state revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars; caused spending on roads, bridges, and education to be slashed; and failed to lift Kansas' below-average economic growth. In 2017, the Republican-controlled Legislature of Kansas voted to roll back the cuts and overrode Brownback's veto.
Sinquefield also has repeatedly backed measures to repeal the earnings taxes of St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri.
He is the primary financial supporter of the Let Voters Decide committee. In 2010, the committee placed a statewide initiative on the Missouri ballot. Called Proposition A, it would prevent all Missouri communities except Kansas City and St. Louis from imposing earnings taxes. It would also allow Kansas City and St. Louis voters to vote on whether to retain their earnings taxes. Missourians passed proposition A with a large margin – 68.4% YES / 31.6% NO (1,294,911 YES votes to 598,010 NO votes).
On January 5, 2011, Let Voters Decide submitted nine initiative petitions to the Missouri Secretary of State calling for a repeal of the state's income tax – with a top rate of six percent. The petitions also called for a higher sales tax, capped at seven percent, that would be applied to virtually any good or service transaction involving individuals. Sinquefield and Let Voters Decide President Travis Brown say that replacing the income tax with a sales tax would help create jobs, promote economic development and make state revenue collection less volatile. In 2014, Missouri lowered its income tax rate.
Local control of St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department
Sinquefield supported the successful effort to return local control of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department to the City of St. Louis. Since 1861, the police department had been run by a five-person board that included four gubernatorial appointees.
Sinquefield donated $300,000 to "A Safer Missouri", a group supporting the campaign for local control. A Safer Missouri endorsed state legislation in favor of local control, along with a ballot initiative filed with the Missouri Secretary of State, which will be pursued if the legislative efforts fail, according to a spokeswoman for A Safer Missouri. The ballot initiative was filed and entitled Proposition A.
Local control, the Proposition A ballot initiative, received broad support, including St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, and the Missouri Democratic Party On February 22, 2011, the House of Representatives passed House Bill 71, the local measure in that body, by a vote of 109–46. The bill went on the Senate,Senate Bill 23, which failed. Thus the ballot initiative was filed and on November 6, 2012, Proposition A passed with 63.9% to 36.1%.
Airport privatization
Rex Sinquefield has been deeply involved in efforts to privatize the St. Louis Lambert International Airport. He split with Travis Brown, his former consultant, following the ballot initiative's withdrawal in 2020.
Philanthropy
Sinquefield and his family donate funds to a wide variety of organizations through the Sinquefield Charitable Foundation. The foundation has donated in particular to the Today and Tomorrow Education Foundation, the Children's Education Alliance of Missouri, the Special Learning Center, the Dual Masters Scholarship Program at Saint Louis University, the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis, World Chess Hall of Fame, and the Mizzou New Music Initiative.
In 2009, Sinquefield and his wife gave $1 million to the University of Missouri's School of Music. Those funds were used to create the New Music Initiative, an effort designed to encourage young people to become composers and to support new works of music composition. Sinquefield has contributed to the St. Vincent Home for Children.
In 2018, Sinquefield and his wife donated $50 million to Saint Louis University as part of the university's bicentennial celebration. The gift helped to fund a new Saint Louis University Research Institute and fund the construction of a new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering building on SLU's campus. The gift was the largest single donation in Saint Louis University's history.
Sinquefield is a director of St. Vincent Home for Children in St. Louis, and a life trustee of DePaul University. He serves on the boards of Saint Louis University, the St. Louis Symphony, the St. Louis Art Museum, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, and the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis. He advises the Archdiocese of St. Louis on finance.
Saint Louis Chess Campus
In 2007, Rex Sinquefield opened the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis, a non-profit organization. An educational organization, its mission is to "maintain a formal program of instruction to teach the game of chess and to promote and support its educational program through community outreach and local and national partnerships to increase the awareness of the educational value of chess." In August 2010, Sinquefield provided seed funding to move the World Chess Hall of Fame to St. Louis, citing the Chess Club's presence and reputation. The Sinquefield Cup is named after him.
In 2016, BBC News reported that Sinquefield, who likes chess “so much he's put tens of millions of dollars into the game,” turned St. Louis into a chess capital because he believes that chess can transform children and their academic lives.
Personal life
He and his wife, Jeanne, met at the Judo Club at the University of Chicago. They have three children and worked together at DFA, where Jeanne ran the trading department.
Since their return to St. Louis, Sinquefield and his wife have divided their time between a 1,000-acre farm and a mansion in the Central West End. St. Louis Magazine said he showed people around the orphanage now called St. Vincent's Home for Children.
He is a devout Roman Catholic.

Tiny Winters (Frederick Gittens, 24 January 1909 – 7 February 1996) was an English jazz bassist and vocalist who worked in the bands of Roy Fox, Bert Ambrose, Lew Stone and Ray Noble.
Winters joined Roy Fox in 1932 and stayed with the group when arranger Lew Stone took over as leader due to Fox's illness. He stayed with Stone until 1937 by which point he was also performing with Nat Gonella's 'band within a band', the Georgians. In 1934 he recorded with Coleman Hawkins during the saxophonist's 1934 visit to England and began leading his own bands from the late 30s.
Throughout the 1960s and 70s, he was part of a group led by George Chisholm that were regularly featured in the Black and White Minstrel Show, while continuing to freelance in various groups as well as with his own Palm House Trio. Winters continued to perform live in the 1980s and 90s often with trumpeter Digby Fairweather. In the 1990s he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London.

Catharina Felicia van Rees (22 August 1831-1 April 1915) was an author, editor, and composer. She wrote novels about the lives of composers and edited a collection of "Dutch Authoresses" to use the language of the time. She wrote her novels under the pseudonym Celéstine. She favored the education of Dutch women and for women to show their talents "into the light and let it shine forth." That stated the Dutch aspect of this was important to her as well and she was willing to include male writers if not enough Dutch women writers were available. She is also of some interest in the History of South Africa as she wrote the National anthem of the Transvaal.

RAAF ambulance aircraft A65-83 (C47-CIZ) was a Douglas DC-3 plane that crashed on or near an island in the Timor area of the Banda Sea during a storm on 19 December 1945.
The plane had been assigned to the Royal Australian Air Force in March 1945 with the call sign VH-CIZ and assigned to 35 Squadrons as an air ambulance.
The aircraft departed from Morotai and flew to Ambon en route to Darwin, piloted by Pilot Officer Francis Robinson. It left Ambon at 10.40AM and, about an hour into the flight, indicated that it wished to place a message. Darwin Aeradio asked the plane to "go ahead" but no response was received.
The following day, a message from the plane claimed that all 22 passengers and 4 crew were "alive... all alive" and were "waiting to be picked up". A second, garbled message, which included the Dakota's call sign CIZ, was also intercepted. Two days after that, a civilian engineer reported picking up a final message stating “Darwin from Timor... waiting to be picked up.”
Unfortunately search efforts at the time proved fruitless and no trace of the plane or those it carried has been found. Without a precise crash site to investigate, the Australian Defence Force have refused to fund a search for the remains, although private efforts to undertake a search continue.

Zou Chenglu (; 17 May 1923 – 23 November 2006), better known as Chen-Lu Tsou, was a Chinese biochemist. He was a professor of the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and later a professor and Deputy Director of the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He made important contributions to the synthesis of insulin, and was elected an academician of the CAS and The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). He won the TWAS Prize in Biology in 1992 for his pioneering study of enzyme inhibition kinetics, and was a six-time laureate of the State Natural Science Award (three times each for First Class and Second Class). His wife, physicist Li Lin, was also an academician of the CAS.
Tsou was a strong advocate against academic fraud and pseudoscience, and led a public campaign against what he called "unhealthy practices" such as administrators' interference in scientific research.
Early life and education
Tsou was born on 17 May 1923 in Qingdao, Shandong province, with his ancestral home in Wuxi, Jiangsu. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he sought refuge in Kunming in China's interior and studied chemistry at the National Southwestern Associated University. After graduation in 1945, he briefly served in the army during World War II.
After the war, Tsou was awarded a government scholarship to study in England, initially bound for the University of Birmingham. On the recommendation of Wang Yinglai, he was accepted by the University of Cambridge to study under David Keilin at the Molteno Institute for Research in Parasitology.
Career
Tsou's doctoral thesis was on the properties of the haemprotein cytochrome c. According to Edward Slater, the research was the first step towards the eventual discovery of protein's structure. After he and his wife both acquired their Ph.D. degrees in 1951, they returned to the newly established People's Republic of China and Tsou became a research professor at the Shanghai Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry where Wang Yinglai served as a deputy director.
After 1958, Tsou was a member of the team at the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry that first achieved the total chemical synthesis of insulin in 1965. His major contribution to the project was to form the disulphate bridges by joining two synthetic polypeptides using oxidation. His method for estimating the number of essential amino acid residues in an enzyme by chemical modification, in which the remaining activity is plotted against the number of residues modified is known as the Tsou plot. In 1981, he was awarded the State Natural Science Award, First Class, for this achievement.
In 1970, Tsou moved to Beijing to help look after his ailing father-in-law Li Siguang, and transferred to the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, when scientific activity was frozen in the anti-intellectual political atmosphere. When American biochemist Emil L. Smith, a fellow alumnus of the Molteno Institute, visited Tsou following Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China, Tsou used reagent bottles filled with water to maintain a pretence of scientific research.
Awards and honors
After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Tsou was able to resume his research and was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980. He pioneered the study of enzyme inhibition kinetics, for which he was awarded the TWAS Prize in Biology in 1992. Despite losing an entire decade of his prime, he published at least 118 papers, mostly in international journals. In 1990, his autobiography was published in Comprehensive Biochemistry Volume 27. By the end of his career, he won the State Natural Science Award First Class three times and Second Class three times. Asteroid 325812 Zouchenglu, discovered by astronomers with the PMO NEO Survey Program at the Purple Mountain Observatory in 2008, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 9 January 2020 ().
Activism
Tsou was a strong advocate against academic fraud and pseudoscience, and led a public campaign against what he called "unhealthy practices" such as administrators' interference in scientific research. At the Institute of Biophysics, Tsou raised objections to Director Bei Shizhang's display of his achievement in cell formation. The criticism poisoned his relationship with Bei, making Tsou feel "uneasy" at the institute. Scientist Rao Yi later raised the same objections and praised Tsou's probity.
Personal life
In 1948, Tsou married Li Lin (Anna Tsou), a fellow Chinese student at the Department of Metallurgy of Cambridge. Li was the daughter of the renowned geologist Li Siguang, who was in England to preside over their wedding, and she would become a prominent physicist. Tsou later recalled the Cambridge years as the best time for his family. Their daughter, geologist Zou Zongping (), was born in the 1950s in China. Li Lin was also elected as an academician of the CAS, making the Li-Tsou family the only one in China that produced three academicians (including Li Siguang).
Despite suffering from cancer in old age, Tsou continued to work until his death. He died in Beijing on 23 November 2006, at the age of 83.

Wasli, also referred to as wasli paper, is a type of handmade paper used specifically for painting miniatures. It was devised in India, in the 10th century, and figures widely in Mughal-era painting.
Wasli can be produced to varying thickness and its uses range from classical/traditional painting methods with opaque water colors to building structures of various kinds.
Miniature Painting is a term used for making opaque/translucent water color paintings/illustrations on a small scale inspired from Persian or Pahari miniature schools and Wasli is used as a canvas for making miniatures.
The term derives from a Persian word Vasl which means union or coming together, oneness, etc.
Wasli is an acid-free paper and it has archival qualities. Paper-eating insects cannot eat it because of a poison copper sulphate (Neela Thootha) used its preparation. The glue typically used to paste sheets together is also acid-free, being made out of cooking flour.
To use it for miniature paintings this layered paper is burnished with either smooth glass or a seashell. This way the paper is shiny and smooth and has minimal perceptible grain.

WBST (92.1 FM) is a National Public Radio-affiliated station in Muncie, Indiana. Studios and offices are located at Ball State University. WBST serves as the flagship station for Indiana Public Radio, which can be heard on three other stations in East-Central Indiana.
Programming mainly consists of news and talk programs provided by National Public Radio as well as classical music.
David Letterman began his broadcasting career at this station. Beginning as a "disc jockey, Letterman was frequently late for work and sneaked forbidden cigarettes into the studio, thus getting on the wrong side of Tom Watson." He was later fired for treating classical music with irreverence.
Brief History
In 1950, Ball State University first introduced radio to campus and city of Muncie. Beginning as a minor project of Robert Robins and situated in the basement at North Hall, WBST quickly grew and expanded. Occurring as a result of an expansive building program, WBST relocated to the Center for Radio and Television and by 1960, had acquired a 10-watt transmitter which allowed their broadcasts to reach the entire campus. Soon, however, this change would not be enough as less than 6 years later, Ball State would demand and receive the rights to build a new radio tower which increased their wattage from 10 to 3,000 which allowed the station to enjoy a larger range which it now still utilizes as of 2018.
Radio Tower Controversy
As Ball State was expanding in the post World War II years, it became apparent that they needed to improve their radio programming. All across the United States, colleges and universities began creating or improving upon their radio and television broadcasting capabilities, and Ball State was quick to adapt. This eventually led officials to allocate around $75,000 to help fund the construction for a new site, tower, and transmitter. However, after the tower's new site along Nebo Road in North Muncie was established, citizens began to express concerns pertaining to decreased property values as a result of the tower, poor television reception caused by interference, and zoning problems. After much debate and threats of Injunctions against the University, this tower was finally completed in the summer of 1978 and WBST could now reach much of East-Central Indiana.
Broader Context
After the end of World War II, American colleges and universities became engorged with a "veteran bulge" as thousands of former military personnel took advantage of the G.I. Bill, and pursued higher education. This then promoted a growth in various educational programs such as radio and later television. This surge in interest then permitted the use of such programs for educational purposes such as listening to school broadcasts, educational records, government speeches, radio courses, school sponsored programs.
A growing concern pertaining to the direction university-run radio would lead, seemed to emerge while this growth was occurring. This issue related to the topic of whether or not University radio would be devoted to commercialization or public radio. Many universities, attempting to blend the two concepts, consequently struggled as "they could not overcome the fundamental contradiction." However, this was a concept that Ball State, as well as many other universities attempted, as in 1951, WBST introduced commercials to their programming.
Conclusion
Overall then, after World War II, collegiate radio programs grew all over the country and Ball State University was no exception. Having humble beginnings with a 10 watt transmitter and no real place to operate, WBST grew to 3,000 watts, employed a devoted staff, a scholarly program, from which David Letterman was a part, and an expensive tower that increased the range of the station. WBST, similar to the programs across the country, grew during this time and became an important addition to Ball State University.
Indiana Public Radio
In 1997, programming from WBST expanded to 4 newly licensed full power stations, also owned by Ball State University, to bring the rest of East-central Indiana an outlet for Public Radio. One of these stations, WBSJ in Portland, Indiana, went off the air on January 4, 2019 due to the failure of its transmitter, and the university decided against replacing the transmitter due to the cost.

The architecture of Boston is a robust combination of old and new architecture. As one of the oldest cities in North America, Boston, Massachusetts (along with its surrounding area) has accumulated buildings and structures ranging from the 17th-century to the present day, having evolved from a small port town to a large cosmopolitan center for education, industry, finance, and technology. The city is known for its granite buildings stemming from its early days. It is also known for being one of the origins of Federal Architecture.
History
Colonial and Post-Revolutionary periods
Boston was founded by Puritan settlers. With them, they brought architecture from England, which ultimately morphed into colonial-style buildings when mixed with other styles such as Georgian architecture. Certain buildings such as the Paul Revere House, Old State House and originally Faneuil Hall embodied this style. The Boston Common was established in 1634, and is now the oldest park in the United States. It originally touched mudflats that led into the harbor, which have since been filled in to form the Back Bay neighborhood and the Boston Public Garden. The land-reclamation project of the early 19th century gradually changed the geography of Boston from a peninsular town with a narrow isthmus connecting it into the mainland into the current coastline seen today.
The American Revolution resulted in many fortifications being built, notably in Dorchester Heights. Following the war which led to American independence, Federal architecture blossomed in the city with Charles Bulfinch and Asher Benjamin as lead architect in that style. It was also accompanied by Greek Revival, with Benjamin as one of the leading architects there. The Massachusetts State House and the rebuilt Faneuil Hall are prime examples of Federal architecture. Many Federal-style buildings and rowhouses can be found in the neighborhood of Beacon Hill.
19th century, Civil War and expansion
In the early 19th century, many buildings in the city were criticized as plain-looking and conservatively planned. However, under new architect Gridley J.F. Bryant, son of the engineer Gridley Bryant, Boston gained numerous buildings and structures during a period of growth that saw the construction of many Victorian-style public buildings. These include the Quincy School, Massachusetts State House's second addition, the 1847 version of Salem station, Charles Street Jail, Ballou Hall, the Old City Hall, Arlington Street Church and others.
Bryant's partner (John Hubbard Sturgis) and apprentice (Charles Brigham) have also been very influential on 19th-century architecture in Boston, at one time partnering up to start their own firm. Their 1876 building for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (since demolished) was one of their signature works.
The iconic train stations for the city, namely South Station and North Station, were originally constructed during the close of the century to centralize transportation. Despite undergoing numerous renovations, they are still used today.
20th century
The early 20th century introduced Art Deco buildings into the city and taller buildings. The Custom House Tower was notable for being an expansion of the original Custom House building and being the first building to surpass the height restriction, as it was exempt from city ordinances due to being federally owned. The original John Hancock Tower was added in 1947. Sports venues such as Fenway Park and the Boston Garden were built during this time as well.
The Interstate Highway system was built during the latter 20th century after many years of planning. Construction of the Central Artery (Interstate 93) and the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) provided better roads into the city but resulted in the demolition of numerous buildings and disruption of neighborhoods. In addition, they led to heavy traffic congestion. The Central Artery, in particular, consisted of the two bounds of elevated highway stacked on top of each other. It was loathed by many of the city's inhabitants, who called it "The Distressway", "the largest parking lot in the world", and "other Green Monster" in reference to the green paint of the section in Fenway Park.
Boston City Hall was built during this time, and was a classic example of Brutalist architecture used mainly for government buildings. The Government Center neighborhood, consisting of courthouses and other federal and state buildings, was built around City Hall, as part of an effort to gentrify the former Scollay Square.
Two of the most iconic skyscrapers in Boston were built during the latter 20th century. The Prudential Tower, located in Back Bay, was completed in 1964, while the John Hancock Tower, which was the third such building constructed by John Hancock Insurance, was completed in 1976. The tower, now known as 200 Claredon Street, remains the tallest building in Boston and New England. The Prudential and Hancock Towers anchor a string of skyscrapers in Back Bay known as the High Spine, which stands out against the surrounding Victorian-era buildings of the neighborhood. Many of the skyscrapers in the Financial District were also built during the 1960s and 1970s as part of a skyscraper boom.
21st century
One of the biggest engineering projects in Boston during the onset of the 2000s was the Big Dig, which effectively moved the elevated highway portion of the Central Artery underground into tunnels. This freed up some space which was converted into surface-level streets and a new public park, now called the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. In addition, I-90 was extended to Boston Logan International Airport.
The 2000s saw a revival of skyscraper building after a dormant 1990s decade. A number of contemporary skyscrapers, such as the Millennium Tower were built, but others such as One Lincoln Street incorporated elements of past styles such as Art Deco into its design.
Notable buildings and structures
Many of Boston's tallest buildings are in two areas, namely the Back Bay neighborhood and Downtown, which can be divided into Government Center, the Financial Center, Downtown Crossing, among others. Other neighborhoods such as North End, South Boston, and Dorchester have distinctive architectural styles, in addition to surrounding suburbs such as Cambridge and Brookline.
Government and municipal
As the state capital of Massachusetts and one of the largest cities in the Northeast, Boston is home to many government and municipal buildings which range in architectural styles. These buildings include but are not limited to:
Massachusetts State House
Boston City Hall
Federal Reserve Bank Building (Boston)
John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum
South Station
Suffolk County Courthouse
Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway
The Brutalist City Hall building has been one of the most divisive buildings in the city, sparking outrage from certain people who call for its demolition, but being praised by architects and critics as one of the proudest buildings in the city's history.
Education
Boston is known as a major college town, being home to many academic institutions such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Northeastern University, Boston College, Boston University, Tufts University, Suffolk University, and others. Their campuses contain notable buildings in traditional and contemporary styles. They include:
Harvard Stadium
Harvard Business School
The Class of 1959 Chapel
Harvard Medical School
Tufts Medical Center
Religious buildings
Boston is home to many religious buildings as part of its Christian heritage. There are numerous large cathedrals such as St. Leonard's Church, the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, the First Church in Boston, and the Old South Church. In addition, the Old South Meeting House is a former Puritan church known as the meeting house of the Boston Tea Party. More modern buildings include the recent additions to The First Church of Christ, Scientist, originally designed and built by Charles Brigham, as part of the Christian Science Center.
Sports
Fenway Park
TD Garden
Matthews Arena
Boston Garden (defunct)
Skyscrapers
The first true skyscraper in the city was the 13-story Ames Building, but since then, more skyscrapers have been built, with most of them rising in the latter half of the 20th century. There are also numerous buildings currently proposed or under construction.

Frank Conley Slay Jr. (July 8, 1930 – September 30, 2017) was an American songwriter, A&R director, record producer, and record label owner. He wrote with Bob Crewe in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the partnership's most successful songs including "Silhouettes", a hit for several artists including The Rays and Herman's Hermits, "Daddy Cool", and "Tallahassee Lassie". As a producer, his biggest hit was "Incense and Peppermints" by the Strawberry Alarm Clock.
Career
He was born in Dallas, Texas, and moved to New York City in 1951, attempting to find work as a songwriter. In 1957 he and Crewe wrote "Silhouettes" and "Daddy Cool" for the Rays. Initially released on the XYZ label set up by Slay and Crewe, "Silhouettes" became a top ten pop hit in the US for both the Rays (#3) and the Diamonds (#10), and was re-recorded successfully by Herman's Hermits in 1965 (#5 US, #3 UK), and Cliff Richard in 1990 (#10 UK). The song "Daddy Cool" – originally on the B-side of the Rays' single – became a #6 hit in the UK in 1977 for Darts. Slay and Crewe also wrote hits for Billy & Lillie, including "La Dee Dah" (covered in the UK by Jackie Dennis), and Freddy Cannon, for whom "Tallahassee Lassie" became a top ten hit in 1959.
In 1961, Slay moved to Philadelphia to become A&R Director for Swan Records, Cannon's record label. As well as producing many of Freddy Cannon's records, he also had a minor hit under his own name in late 1961, "Flying Circle", an instrumental adaptation of the traditional song "Hava Nagila", which reached #45 on the Billboard pop chart credited to Frank Slay and his Orchestra. Slay moved back to New York around 1963, and then to Los Angeles. He worked as an independent producer, and in 1967 produced "Incense and Peppermints", a US #1 hit for Strawberry Alarm Clock. He also set up Claridge Records in 1965. In 1974 the label had a US hit with "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" by Sugarloaf, a record described by Slay as "probably ... the last top ten record on Billboard by a truly independent record company ..."
Slay remained active in the music industry and last lived in San Diego, California.

Coconut production contributes to the national economy of Thailand. According to figures published in December 2009 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, it is the world's sixth largest producer of coconuts, producing 1,721,640 tonnes in 2009. In 2012 it was reported that Thailand had 216,000 hectares of coconut palm plantations and produced 845 million whole coconuts.
As evidence of the importance of the coconut industry to the Thai economy, the Thai government has enacted strict standards for some categories of coconut products.

Enamel hypocalcification is a defect of tooth enamel in which normal amounts of enamel are produced but are hypomineralized. In this defect the enamel is softer than normal. Some areas in enamel are hypocalcified: enamel spindles, enamel tufts, and enamel lamellae.
Causal factors may occur locally, affecting only a single tooth, or they may act systemically, affecting all teeth in which enamel is being formed. Local trauma or abscess formation can adversely affect the ameloblasts overlying a developing crown, resulting in enamel hypocalcification or hypoplasia. Affected teeth may have areas of coronal discoloration, or they
may have actual pits and irregularities. This is most commonly seen in permanent teeth in which the overlying deciduous tooth becomes abscessed or is physically forced into the enamel organ of the permanent tooth. The resulting hypoplastic or hypocalcified permanent tooth is sometimes known as Turner's tooth.

The Free Edinburgh Fringe Festival is a programme of free entry events that takes place at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world's largest arts festival, each August. It is organised by the comedy promoter Laughing Horse, although it includes shows of different genres, and is one of several "free" festivals taking place in the city at that time, most of which incorporate the words free, fringe and/or festival in their title, often leading to confusion.
Free Edinburgh Fringe Festival venues are commonly independently run bars and nightclubs which create performance spaces in their premises for the duration of the Fringe Festival. Performers are allocated timeslots for free on the condition that they do not charge audiences an entry fee to watch the show. Although audience members are asked to make voluntary contributions at the end of the shows to help pay the performers expenses.
Generally, Edinburgh Fringe shows are self-financing and the average run at the fringe can cost a performer £5000 in venue hire fees, publicity and accommodation. The aim of The Free Festival is to provide performers and festival goers with a cheaper alternative.
Predominantly the shows are stand up comedy and sketch comedy but in recent years there has been an increase in theatre, cabaret, music, storytelling and children's shows.
Free Festival programme
The Free Festival promotes comedy, theatre, music, cabaret, opera, musicals, film, children's shows, events and art displays – programmed by experienced producers in each area. Award winning performers and full runs of shows from the likes of Pappy's Fun Club, John Gordillo, Lewis Schaffer, Nick Wilty, Sol Bernstein, Steve Day, Bob Slayer, Nik Coppin and Ivor Dembina have appeared in previous years, plus guest appearances in compilation shows from well known performers such as Alan Carr, Scott Capurro, Richard Herring, Brendon Burns, Marcus Brigstocke, Reg D. Hunter, Dan Antopolski and Paul Foot.
Critical acclaim
The Free Festival has received coverage from Sky News, BBC, Culture Show, The Guardian, The Times, The Scotsman, The List, Metro, Chortle and many other local publications. In 2009 75% of Free Festival shows were reviewed 3 star and above, with thirty 4-star and 20 5-star reviews.
2010 facts
In 2010 the Free Festival produced over 300 shows at the fringe.
Imran Yusuf's Free Festival show became the first non-ticketed show at the Edinburgh Festival to be nominated for a main Comedy Award for Best Newcomer
2009 facts
In 2009 there were a total of 2,098 shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and 235 of these (over 11%) were part of the Free Festival making it the largest promoter of free events at the Fringe, and after the Edinburgh Comedy Festival the second largest promoter of Comedy).

Free festival history
The Free Festival was set up by Alex Petty of Laughing Horse, who has organised free venues at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe since 2004. It was originally in a partnership with The Free Fringe founded by Peter Buckley Hill but split away from that organisation in 2006.
Heroes of Fringe
In 2011 Bob Slayer, a performer and previous booker for the Free Festival set up independent fringe promoter Heroes of Fringe in a former Free Festival venue: Heroes @ The Hive. The move was amicable and the two organisations maintain a working relationship. In 2013 Heroes added a second venue Heroes @ Bob & Miss Behave's Bookshop. Heroes shows have won three Malcolm Hardee Awards and been nominated for several other awards. In 2013 Adrienne Truscott won the Edinburgh Fringe Awards (formerly the Perrier) panel prize for spirit of the Fringe.

Beckenham Station is a railway station on the Australian Transperth network. It is located on the Armadale Line, from Perth Station serving the suburb of Beckenham.
History
The station opened in 1954 as Higham. The additional station, with two others on the Armadale line, marked the introduction of diesel-mechanical railcars on Perth's metropolitan passenger railways. Higham was renamed Beckenham in 1969. The platforms are staggered across William Street to minimise the time the level crossing is closed to road traffic.
In March 2014 an $8.1 million upgrade to the station and adjacent car parks was completed.
Future
Beckenham Station will potentially be rebuilt for the removal of the William Street level crossing. This is currently being considered as part of a Metronet project for the removal of level crossings on the Armadale line. The final decision on the William Street level crossing and Beckenham station will be made when the contract is awarded.
Services
Beckenham Station is served by Transperth Armadale Line services. Services to and from the Thornlie spur line run non-stop through the station.
The station saw 191,969 passengers in the 2013-14 financial year.

Moshe Jakobovits () (15 March 1926 – 29 December 2018) was commander of Masu'ot Yitzhak, a kibbutz in Gush Etzion (the Etzion Bloc) destroyed in the 1947–1949 Palestine war (known in Israel as Israel War of Independence), the last commander of the Gush Etzion settlements during the Israel War of Independence, Chief Customs officer of Haifa between the years 1977–1987, and Consul for Economy and Trade (Customs) in Europe between 1987 and 1990.
Jakobovits was one of two sons of Rabbi Tobias Jakobovits, Czech historian and librarian, and was the cousin of Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth. Jakobovits added Jakobi to his family name (Moshe Jakobi-Jakobovits) prior to his diplomatic mission for the State of Israel.
Childhood
Moshe Jakobovits was born in 1926 in Prague, capital of Czechoslovakia, son of Bertha (née Petuchowski, of Berlin) and Rabbi Tobias Jakobovits – librarian of the Jewish community of Prague and scholar of Jewish texts. Born to a religious family, Moshe was educated at the Jewish school in his native city. The school was located in the same building in which the family resided, at Jáchymova Street, No. 3, today housing the offices of the Jewish Museum of Prague. In March 1939, days before the entry of the Wehrmacht into Prague, Moshe Jakobovits marked his Bar Mitzvah by ascending to the Torah in the Altneuschul Synagogue in Prague. The venue of the event did not appear on the invitations for the security of invitees. Following his Bar Mitzvah, Moshe joined the Bnei Akiva youth movement.
Aliyah (immigration)
On 21 October 1939, Moshe Jakobovits was sent to Mandatory Palestine under the auspices of the Youth Aliyah, and lived in Tel Aviv with his uncle, Michael Jakobovits. Following his Aliyah, he studied and lived at Yeshiva "Ha'Yishuv Ha'Chadash" of Rabbi Amiel in Tel Aviv, and, subsequently, at Yeshivat "Kol Torah" in Jerusalem. During the 1941/42 academic year, following a conversation with Henrietta Szold, Moshe Jakobovits moved to the Moshav Kfar Haroeh where he joined a group of children preparing for studies at an agricultural school of the Youth Aliyah. In the 1943/44 academic year, the group began its studies at the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School. During his studies at Mikveh Israel, Moshe Jakobovits joined the Haganah and underwent basic training.
Before the War of Independence
Joining the "Masu'ot" Group
At the end of 1943/44 academic year, Jakobovits finished high school at Mikveh Israel and, with other graduates of the school, formed the "Czech Gar'in" ["Gar'in" refers to a "nucleus" or formative group] which began its training at Kibbutz Tirat Zvi in 1943. During his training at Tirat Zvi, he volunteered to be a "Noter" in the Jewish Settlement Police set up by the British, serving as a Noter in the Gilboa Brigade at Tirat Zvi station, and, in parallel, continued to be active in the Haganah. During this period he met his spouse to-be, Sarah Schwarz.
In November 1944, he and fellow members of his Gar'in, then already called the "Masu'ot Group", established a temporary kibbutz settlement within the bounds of Kfar Haroeh, with the objective of establishing a permanent settlement on Mount Hebron, next to Kibbutz Kfar Etzion. In April 1945, the Gar'in moved to Gat Rimon, next to Petach Tikva. At the beginning of November 1945, the Gar'in established a settlement on the land of Hubela, to the west of Kfar Etzion, and decided to name the new kibbutz "Masu'ot Yitzhak," after the Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevy Herzog, then still living.
Commander of Masu'ot Yitzhak
Moshe Jakobovits continued to serve as a Noter at Masu'ot Yitzhak as well. He was sent to a Notrim course at the central school for Notrim at a youth village next to Afula, and, upon his return from the course, he was appointed commander of the Notrim station at Masu'ot Yitzhak. In parallel, he continued his activity with the Haganah, as was customary in that period. In this context he participated in the squad leader training course of the Haganah, Jerusalem District, conducted at Gush Etzion (the "Etzion Bloc") in the summer of 1946. That same year, he was called upon to serve as regional director of Masu'ot Yitzhak – this, too, in the context of the Haganah. A dispute erupted between the people of the young kibbutz and the Arabs of the area over a portion of the lands of the settlement, especially concerning a plot that was called the "600 dunam". In the summer of 1947, the Arabs attacked a group of kibbutz members engaged in agricultural work in the disputed area, and a squad of Notrim was summoned from Masu'ot Yitzhak under the command of Moshe Jakobovits. On the heels of a riot that erupted, the British police were summoned and separated the belligerents. An investigation was launched against Moshe Jakobovits for use of arms, and he was suspended from his post as commander of the Notrim station until the investigation was completed. During the period of his suspension (summer to fall, 1947), the Haganah Jerusalem Zone Command sent him to a course for platoon commanders, at that time, effectively an officers' training course.
Platoon Commander Course
The platoon commander course in which Jakobovits participated (Course 19) was the last such course directed by the Haganah. The course, under the command of Mundak Pasternak (Moshe Bar-Tiqvah), was initially conducted at the kibbutzim Sarid and Ginegar in the Jezreel Valley, with the participants under the cover of naturalists. The platoon of Moshe Jakobovits – Platoon 1, under the command of Danny Mass – trained unarmed at Kibbutz Sarid, while Platoon 2, under Natanel Hitron, and Platoon 3 under Uzi Narkis, trained at Kibbutz Ginegar and included training with a medium machine gun in a hidden cave. A British patrol detected the site of machine gun training and it was consequently decided to move the entire course to Juara. At the end of the course, in November 1947, Moshe Jakobovits stood for oral examination by Haim Laskov and Yigael Yadin, and participated in the graduation review in the presence of Haganah Commander-in-chief Yaakov Dori. Beside Moshe Jakobovits, other graduates of Platoon Commander Course 19 included personalities who held key positions in the War of Independence, and thereafter, as major generals and brigadier generals. Among them were Yekutiel Adam, Avraham Adan ("Bren"), Uri ben Ari, Mordechai ben Porat, Rehavam Ze'evi ("Gandhi"), Avraham Tamir (Avrasha), Israel Tal (Talik), Yaakov Salman, Elad Peled, Moshe Rusnak, Nachum Shoshani, Aharon (Jimmy) Shemi, and many others.
During the Course of the Battles
Command of Masu'ot Yitzhak
After completion of the course, Jakobovits returned to Masu'ot Yitzhak. A few days thereafter, on 29 November 1947, the United Nations decided upon the partition of Palestine. The Etzion Bloc was included in the intended Arab state. The day after the partition declaration (the onset of the War of Independence), Jakobovits was summoned to the headquarters of the Jerusalem Sector of the Haganah for assignment of a command role. Among the various roles he was offered, Jakobovits elected to return to his role as regional commander in Masu'ot Yitzhak. During the first weeks, he was responsible for securing convoys from Jerusalem to the Etzion Bloc. On the night of 15–16 January 1948, Jakobovits stood at the head of his men, at the western emplacements of Masu'ot Yitzhak, awaiting the arrival of the Mountain Brigade (the Brigade of the Lamed-Heh = Convoy of 35) that had been dispatched to reinforce and resupply Gush Etzion. With dawn, Jakobovits discerned heavy traffic of military vehicles and ambulances in the region of the village of Jeva. Only later would the connection with the bitter fate of the Brigade of the Lamed-Heh become clear.
Commander of the Western Sector
On 21 March 1948, Moshe (Mosh) Zilberschmidt assumed command of Gush Etzion. In early May, he redesigned the defenses of the four settlements of the Bloc, and divided the Bloc into three defensive sectors. Moshe Jakobovits was name commander of the western sector, in addition to his position as regional commander of Masu'ot Yitzhak. Under his command was a company composed of defenders of Masu'ot Yitzhak and Revadim, responsible for the defense of the two settlements and the adjacent command posts: "the Fifth Point," "Giv'at Olga," "the 600 Dunam," and "Giv'at Hasla'im" ["Boulder Hill"] that connected Masu'ot Yitzhak to Kfar Etzion. In the Arab attack on Gush Etzion on 4 May 1948, Jakobovits sent forces of the brigade under his command to capture the first three command posts.
Rescue of the Hospital and Its People
On the 12 May 1948, a massive Arab attack began on the redoubts of Gush Etzion. To maintain constant communication between Masu'ot Yitzhak and Kfar Etzion – even in the face of Arab penetration of the first line of defense – Moshe Jakobovits sent a squad from Masu'ot Yitzhak to capture Giv'at Hasla'im. This force managed to deflect charges of the Arab Legion and thus prevent an attack on Kfar Etzion from this direction. Under the cover of darkness, Jakobovits managed to reach Kfar Etzion to coordinate with Ya'akov Altman (named commander of the Bloc after Mosh fell at the Battle of the Russian Monastery) and to convince him to move the hospital, and all of its medical personnel and injured to Masu'ot Yitzhak. Evauation of the hospital was conducted during the course of the night by the men of Masu'ot Yitzhak who carried the injured on their backs and secured the path via Giv'at Sela'im. The hospital was lodged in natural caves in Masu'ot Yitzhak that had been cleaned and prepared in advance for possible shelter. Thus, Jakobovits saved the lives of about sixty injured and medical staff, among them Weisenberg, director of the hospital, and the chief medic, Rivka Nedivi (Prague, born 1926) who volunteered to remain in Gush Etzion and treat the injured while her infant was evacuated to Jerusalem, along with the other mothers and children.
The "Queen" Has Fallen
The next morning, several armored vehicles of the Legion succeeded in penetrating into Kfar Etzion, and its defenders decided to surrender. After the surrender, a massacre was perpetrated on the men of Kfar Etzion, among them Ya׳akov Altman. Nachum ben-Sira, member of Masu'ot Yitzhak, succeeded in escaping the massacre and reached the kibbutz. Moshe Jakobovitz assumed command of the Bloc, the forces under his command were arrayed for the defence of Masu'ot Yitzhak, Revadim and Ein Tzurim. Later in the day, he telegraphed Haganah HQ in Jerusalem, by means of a heliograph: "Queen has fallen, we are left without ammunition and will not be able to hold. Requesting assistance." ('Queen' was the code name for Kfar Etzion.)
As POW in Jordan
It was concluded that the Etzion Bloc would surrender and that its fighters would be taken prisoner. Due to the concern that Arab villagers would breach the kibbutzim and slaughter their inhabitants, Moshe Jakobovits decided that surrender would be orderly and would be coordinated with officers of the Legion, thus ensuring the safety of the surviving residents. On the afternoon of Friday, 14 May 1948 – at the time Ben Gurion declared the establishment of the State of Israel in Tel Aviv – two Legion officers arrived at Masu'ot Yitzhak and began coordination with Moshe Jakobovits, with the assistance of the medic Uriel Ofek, who knew Arabic. They promised to preserve the safety of the people of the settlements, and, in accordance with their promise, soldiers of the Legion took up positions around the settlement and drove away Arab villagers with gunfire. The Legion officers also acceded to Jakobovits's request and allowed him to remove a Torah scroll and Holy Books, previously hidden in the ground, and to remove them along with the population of Masu'ot Yitzhak.
After about two weeks' confinement at the Hebron police station, the prisoners of war were transferred to a prison camp at Umm el-Jammal. The prisoners were released in stages, in several groups, ending in March 1949, and were transferred to Israel via the Mandelbaum Gate. Moshe Jakobovits was the last to leave the POW camp.
At the Treasury (Israel Tax Authority – Customs)
About two months after his release from custody, he was married and the couple moved to Haifa. There, Jakobovits began to work at Customs. In 1977, he was appointed Chief Customs Officer (גובה המכס) for the Haifa and Northern District. At the time of the First Lebanon War, he served as responsible for the negotiating the transport of goods from Lebanon. To that end, he met in Haifa with his Lebanese counterpart from Beirut. In the summer of 1987, Moshe Jakobovits was sent to Milan, Italy, where he served as Consul for Economy and Trade (Customs) in Europe until his return to Israel in the summer of 1990. Moshe Jakobovits was survived by a son and daughter, five grandchildren and four great grandchildren.

The dusky-green oropendola (Psarocolius atrovirens) is a species of bird in the family Icteridae (New World blackbirds). It is found on the eastern slope of the Andes in Bolivia and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and heavily degraded former forest.
Description
The male dusky-green oropendola grows to a length of about and the female of about . The sexes are similar in morphology, the plumage being mainly dark brownish-green or blackish-green, with a rufous-brown rump and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca). The beak is greenish-white, there may be a few yellow feathers on the head, and the iris is brown or blue, the latter colour perhaps being in older birds. The russet-backed oropendola (Psarocolius angustifrons), which partly shares the same range, has more rufous upper parts, a yellow forehead and olive-green head which contrasts with its back and wings.
Distribution and habitat
The dusky-green oropendola occurs on the east side of the Andes Mountains, its range extending from Huánuco Province in central Peru to Santa Cruz Department in Bolivia. It occurs in montane forests and near their edges at altitudes of between above sea level, mostly at greater elevations than the russet-backed oropendola.
Ecology
The diet of this bird probably consists of insects (including moths), arthropods, small vertebrates, nectar and fruits. The breeding season is between October and December. The birds breed colonially but colony sizes are small.
Status
The dusky-green oropendola is a common species with a very wide range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified it as being of "least concern" because, although its forest habitat is being gradually reduced, any decline in the numbers of birds is not at a sufficient rate to justify putting the bird in a more threatened category.

Pygidianops is a genus of pencil catfishes native to South America.
Species
There are currently four recognized species in this genus:
Pygidianops amphioxus de Pinna & Kirovsky, 2011
Pygidianops cuao Schaefer, Provenzano, de Pinna & Baskin, 2005
Pygidianops eigenmanni Myers, 1944
Pygidianops magoi Schaefer, Provenzano, de Pinna & Baskin, 2005
Distribution
P. eigenmanni is from the Rio Negro basin in Brazil. P. cuao is known only from Cuao River drainage basin. P. magoi is known only from lower Orinoco mainstem between Ciudad Bolívar and Barrancas in Venezuela.
Description
Species of Pygidianops share the extreme reduction of pigmentation, loss of the dorsal fin, the loss or extreme reduction of pectoral fins, a reduced lateral line, and the reduction or complete loss of eyes in some species. These fish are markedly miniaturized, yet retain a relatively well-ossified skeleton comparable in both bone differentiation and degree of calcification to that observed in larger trichomycterids.
P. cuao is distinguished from congeners by the presence of diminutive eyes (vs. eyes absent in both other species), posterior naris absent (vs. nares bilaterally paired), and the presence of a triangular skin flap at mouth corner (vs. skin flap absent). P. magoi is distinguished from all congeners by the absence of pectoral and anal fins (vs. fins present), posterior naris absent (vs. present, nares bilaterally paired), four laterosensory pores on the head (vs. six), and by the presence of 9–10 caudal fin rays (vs. 12–13). With all of its fins lost except the caudal fin, P. magoi represents the most extreme fin loss among ostariophysans. P. eigenmanni lacks eyes but has its anal and pectoral fins.

was a skilled Japanese Noh actor, troupe leader, and playwright. His plays are particularly characterized by an intricate, allusive, and subtle style inherited from Zeami which convolved yūgen with influences from Zen Buddhism (his Zen master was Ikkyū) and Kegon. Actors should strive for unconscious performance, in which they enter the "circle of emptiness"; such a state of being is the highest level of artistic or religious achievement.
He lived, worked, and died in the Nara area of Japan. He was trained by Zeami and his son, Motomasa (died 1432), eventually marrying a daughter of Zeami. At some point he took the artistic name Komparu Ujinobu and then finally Komparu Zenchiku. In 1443, he became the leader of the Kanze acting troupe and thus the second successor to Zeami Motokiyo. Zeami passed on his secret teachings to Zenchiku, apparently prompting Zeami's exiling; this refusal to transmit to his blood descendants also prompted a split between the Komparu school and the Kanze. Zenchiku's grandson was Konparu Zenpō, and his descendants would continue to head the Komparu school of Noh.

Men's 66 kg competition in judo at the 2000 Summer Olympics was held on 17 September at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre.
This event was the second-lightest of the men's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 66 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.

The Charles T. Mitchell House is a private house located at 118 North Shelby Street in Cadillac, Michigan, USA. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1987 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
History
George A. Mitchell, a brother to Congressman William Mitchell of Indiana, arrived in the Cadillac area in 1869, exploring the proposed route of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad. Mitchell was particularly interested in the area near Clam Lake (now Lake Cadillac). In 1871, Mitchell returned to the area and platted a village on the shore of the lake, and by January 1872 the village already had 300 inhabitants. Mitchell was able to induce many influential businessmen and lumbermen to settle in his new community, including his nephew William W. Mitchell.
In 1874, George Mitchell built this house in the Second Empire style, including ornate carved woodwork inside and a mansard roof outside. Mitchell lived here until 1878, when his business partner, Wellington W. Cummer, purchased it. Cummer lived in the house until 1922.
George Mitchell's nephew William Mitchell went on to form, with partner Jonathan W. Cobbs, the firm of Cobbs & Mitchell, which was among the largest lumbering firms in Michigan; he also formed Mitchell Brothers. In 1876, William Mitchell married Ella Yost; the couple had two children, Charles T. Mitchell and Marie Mitchell. As the 20th century dawned, Charles T. Mitchell began looking after William Mitchell's affairs, and when William died in 1915, Charles was able to step in as president of the companies formerly headed by his father.
In 1922, Charles T. Mitchell purchased the house built by his uncle George from Wellington W. Cummer. In 1926, Mitchell completely renovated he houses to reflect the then-current Prairie School trend in architecture. The house was clad with red brick, most of the ornamentation was removed, and the mansard roof was replaced with a low hip roof.
Description
The Charles T. Mitchell House is a two-story rectangular house clad in rust-colored brick with a slate hip roof. A single story, L-shaped carriage house is constructed similarly.

Arthur Cave Wathen (27 March 1841 – 14 March 1937) was an English school teacher and amateur cricketer. Wathen was a right-handed batsman who fielded occasionally as a wicket-keeper during the 1860s.
Life
Wathen was born at Streatham, then in Surrey, in 1841, the son of Hubert and Harriet Wathen. His father was a tea merchant in London and was the Master of the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1850. Wathen was educated at Blackheath Proprietary School before going up to Wadham College, Oxford in 1859.
Wathen played club cricket for Surrey sides in 1861 whist at university, and played his first first-class cricket match for the Gentlemen of the South against the Gentlemen of the North at Trent Bridge in the same year, scoring 42 runs on his debut. The family lived at Beckenham in Kent and Wathen played most of his cricket for the Gentlemen of West Kent, as well as playing for other amateur sides, including the Gentlemen of Kent, Band of Brothers and Reigate Priory. He played for Kent County Cricket Club in nine first-class matches in 1863 and 1864, scoring a total of 147 runs at an average of 8.64, with a high score of 42 not out. He also made three first-class appearances for the Gentlemen of Kent during Canterbury Cricket Weeks, playing twice against the Gentlemen of the MCC in 1863 and 1864, as well against MCC in 1866, playing some matches alongside his brother William.
After 1871 Wathen moved from Beckenham to run a school on Chesham Place in Brighton. He married Agnes Richardson in 1883 and lived in Brighton for most of the remainder of his life. Despite being a teacher, he was a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers and was given the Freedom of the City of London, both through his family connections.
Wathen died in 1937 at a nursing home at Bradfield in Berkshire. He was aged 97.

The Norman House is a grade I listed building and scheduled monument in the city centre of York, in England. Although in ruins, it has been described as "York's oldest house", dating from the 12th century.
The building was constructed in the late 12th century, about 14 metres to the north of the street of Stonegate. Although the area had been occupied in the Roman Eboracum period, it had been abandoned. It is believed that it was open ground until new building plots were laid out under the influence of the clergy of York Minster, as it lay within the Liberty of St Peter.
While many of the new buildings were tenements, others were impressive houses, several of which were used by religious office-holders. The Norman House was a two-storey structure, built of Magnesian Limestone, and based on surviving walls, each floor measured at least 11 feet by 6. The ground floor undercroft had three pillars, supporting the upper storey. This was probably an open hall, and it was lit by windows to the south-west.
The York Civic Trust speculates that the house may originally have been built as the house of a Jewish financier. The Jews in York were massacred in 1190, and by the time the house was first recorded, in 1376, it belonged to the prebend of Ampleforth. It remained in use by clergy linked to the Minster for the next few centuries. It was largely demolished in or before the 18th century, but two walls survived, incorporated in later buildings.
In 1939, demolition of later buildings revealed the two surviving walls of the house, and also the bases of the pillars of the undercroft, and the base of a garderobe shaft. The shaft and pillars were three-and-a-half feet below the current ground level, and so were covered over, but the walls were preserved, and the former interior of the building made into a small courtyard, so that the remains can be viewed from the inside. They are accessed by a snickelway, running between numbers 50 and 52 Stonegate.
The south-east wall is believed to have been a gable end. Its stonework is only present in patches, infilled with later brick, but it does include a cupboard, with grooves showing where doors and a shelf would have sat. The south-west wall is more complete, and includes a double-arched window, in the Norman style. The north-west wall is of a later date, but includes some stones taken from the original house.
The house was made a scheduled monument, and in 1954 also became a Grade I listed building. Although it is in ruins, the Civic Trust describes it as "York's oldest house", while the Inventory of the Historical Monuments in City of York states that "the remains are of great historical interest".

G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KCNJ9 gene.
Function
Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins. It associates with another G-protein-activated potassium channel to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming complex.
Interactions
KCNJ9 has been shown to interact with KCNJ6.

The Democratic Party of the Left, the Northern League, the Italian Republican Party and the Greens refrained from voting for confidence in the government.
The government resigned on 13 January 1994.
Party breakdown
The government was initially composed of the members of the following parties:
Independents: Prime Minister, 8 ministers
Christian Democracy (DC): 8 ministers and 20 undersecretaries
Italian Socialist Party (PSI): 5 ministers and 10 undersecretaries
Italian Liberal Party (PLI): 1 minister and 3 undersecretaries
Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI): 1 minister and 3 undersecretaries

Harper County (county code HP) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 5,485. Its county seat and most populous city is Anthony. The county was named for Sergeant Marion Harper of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry, who died of wounds suffered near Waldron, Arkansas, in December 1863.
History
Early history
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Harper County was established.
The original organization of Harper County was one of the largest frauds in county government. In 1873, a group of three men organized Harper County, designating the then fictitious city of "Bluff City" as the county seat. The petition for organization used several names out of a Cincinnati city directory to represent as residents of Harper County. In 1874, the state attorney general investigated, and found not a single resident of the county. The "founders" of the county had sold $40,000 worth of bonds.
Harper County was settled starting in 1877, and the county was organized for a second time in 1878 by the Glenn and Robinson families. Since Bluff City could not be shown to have existed, Anthony was designated as the temporary county seat. In an election in 1879, Anthony won as county seat even though 2,960 votes were cast in a county with 800 legal voters.
21st century
Due to new and high-paying jobs at area oil fields and wind farms, Harper County experienced an economic boom; as of 2012, rental housing and office space in towns such as Danville, Harper, and Anthony had more than quadrupled in price, in properties ranging from double-wide trailers to a Carnegie library. However, by 2016, the oil fracking boom had largely played out and the economies of Harper and adjacent counties suffered under the impact. Earthquakes, due to induced seismicity from injection wells, had also substantially reduced in frequency and intensity, thanks to a Kansas Corporation Commission order mandating cutbacks in volumes and pressures. SandRidge Energy, which along with Chesapeake Energy was one of the two major producers in Harper county, appealed the order, but soon went into bankruptcy.

Steve Blyth is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s and 1980s. He played for the Newtown Jets and the Western Suburbs Magpies in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition.
Playing career
Blyth made his first grade debut for Western Suburbs in 1976. In 1978, Western Suburbs appointed Roy Masters as their new head coach. Masters turned Western Suburbs from a team that had been in decline since the 1960s in to a competitive team which could compete for the premiership. Blyth made 14 appearances for Wests as they claimed the minor premiership in 1978 but fell short of a grand final appearance.
In 1979, Blyth left Wests to join Newtown. Newtown would go on to finish second last avoiding their fourth consecutive wooden spoon. Under the coaching of Warren Ryan, Newtown went from a struggling team to premiership contenders. Newtown would go on to reach the 1981 NSWRL grand final against Parramatta with Blyth being selected to play for in the starting side.
Newtown trailed Parramatta 7-6 at halftime but Parramatta stormed home in the second half to win 20-11 and claim their first premiership at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Blyth played on with Newtown in 1982 but they were unable to replicate their form from the previous season and missed out on the finals. Blyth retired at the end of the 1982 season.

Martindale is a valley, village and civil parish in Cumbria, England, situated within the Lake District National Park between the lakes of Ullswater and Haweswater. The valley is served by a narrow minor road which runs as far as the farm of Dale Head. This road commences at Howtown, a hamlet on the shore of Ullswater that forms part of the civil parish but is not in the valley of Martindale, and passes over a mountain pass or hause into the valley.
At the time of the 2011 census the population of the civil parish was less than 100. Details are included in the parish of Bampton.
Description
Martindale runs for approximately nine km in a north to south direction, it is a remote and thinly populated valley which has a permanent population of only about 50 residents. The foot of the valley is located at the small hamlet of Sandwick on the western shore of Ullswater, while its head is situated on the slopes of Rampsgill Head where the headwaters of Howegrain Beck rise at a height of around 700 metres above sea level. The upper part of the valley is divided into two branches by the fell of To Nab, these two sub valleys named Bannerdale and Rampsgill contain the streams of Bannerdale Beck and Rampsgill Beck which meet at a point midway down Martindale to form Howegrain Beck which then becomes the main watercourse for the lower part of Martindale and enters Ullswater at Sandwick. Just before reaching Sandwick, Martindale is joined by the side valley of Boredale, which enters from the south.
Deer reserve
The upper part of Martindale around To Nab is a deer reserve which is not open to the public and contains no rights of way. The reserve is home to the oldest native red deer herd in England. Hill walkers are requested by the Dalemain Estate, which owns the reserve, to keep to preferred routes which avoid the herds when climbing To Nab, to which there is now open access under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Access to the summit of to Nab is across a difficult peat bog and there is no descent from to Nab, instead walkers must return back to High Street.
At the foot of To Nab is “The Bungalow”, this is a former shooting lodge which was constructed in 1910 by Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale for a deer shooting visit by the German Emperor Wilhelm II in 1910. Today The Bungalow is used as self-catering accommodation which houses 10 people.
Habitations
The main area of habitation in the valley itself is situated in its lower area where the road comes over the hause from Howtown. Here there is Hause Farm, The Old Reading Room and a few self-catering holiday homes. At the top of the hause is St Peter's Church often referred to as the New Church, it dates from 1880. Half a kilometre further up the valley is the restored St Martin's Church, the present building dates from the end of the 16th century. Other farm buildings in the mid and upper parts of Martindale are Winter Crag, Knicklethorns, Henhow, Thrang Crag and Dale Head.
Martindale is surrounded by the Far Eastern Fells and is a popular starting point for hillwalking. One of the most popular walks is the Martindale Skyline, a 16 km walk with just over 1000 metres of ascent which takes in many of the peaks around the valley including Beda Fell and Steel Knotts.

Peter Charles Allen (born 1 November 1946 in Hove, Sussex) is an English former footballer who played as a midfielder, and is the current holder of Leyton Orient's all-time appearance record. He is the only player to have played more than 400 times for the Orient.
Allen joined Tottenham Hotspur as a schoolboy, where he was spotted by Orient manager Dave Sexton. Allen turned professional at the Orient in July 1965, and made his debut in September of that year. During the late 1960s, he became a regular in the first team, playing in over 40 league matches per season from 1968–1973. In 1970, he turned down an offer from Everton.
Allen was noted at the Orient for his versatility, able to play in defence when required, as well as being capable of scoring goals from midfield. He earned a testimonial in 1976, the year he broke Orient's appearance record, previously held by Arthur Wood. In all competitions, Allen made 491 appearances for the club, scoring 29 goals.
He left Orient in March 1978 to join Millwall, but only stayed briefly before retiring due to injury at the age of 32. He subsequently qualified as a solicitor, and set up his own partnership in Portslade in 1988.

George Arthur Forrest (born 1940) is a Belgian entrepreneur, owner of the Forrest Group (Groupe Forrest), a group of companies founded in the Belgian Congo in 1922 and active in wind power and hydroelectric energy, construction, mines and metallurgy, biological food and aviation.
He has been described as a philanthropic employer. Forrest is reported to be one of the richest men in Congo.
Background
George Arthur Forrest was born in 1940 in Lubumbashi in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
He was the son of an Irish immigrant.
His father, Malta Forrest, had founded l'Entreprise Générale Malta Forrest (EGMF) in 1922 in Katanga Province in the south of the Belgian Congo. The company started as a transport company, then moved into mining and then into civil engineering. In 1968 it became a limited liability company, with George Forrest and his adoptive brother Victor Eskenazi-Forrest as Managing Directors. In 1986, after his brother died, George Forrest took full control. He created the George Forrest International Group in 1995.
In the early 2000s his company acquired several major cement production facilities, which should benefit from construction demand with the end of the Second Congo War in 2003.
Forrest's DRC operations grew to include 9,500 direct employees and 15,000 subcontractors.
Forrest is a sponsor of Dialogues, a non-profit association that promotes the visual arts in Lubumbashi and supports the city's museum. He also owns the Grelka Biano Ranch, with 30,000 head of cattle and 800 local employees.
Controversies
In December 2001 the United Nations asked a panel of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The panel's report was issued in October 2002. In it they said George Forrest had long-standing ties to the establishment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and described him as a member of the elite network of Congolese interests.

San Carlos de Borromeo Fortress () is a colonial fortress in the Bay of Pampatar in the northeast of Isla Margarita, Venezuela.
It was completed in 1684 for protection against the constant threat of pirates. The fortress was ransacked several times before Venezuela gained independence from Spain. Today the castle has been restored and serves as a museum.
History
Pampatar, or Port Royal Mampatare, was founded in 1536 on the shore of the best protected deep water anchorage on the island.
The city was divided into two parts due to the irregular coastline.
The original castle was built over a period of about 20 years, started in 1622.
It was sited in the heart of the old city, looking out over the Bay of Pampatar.
Its purpose, together with the La Caranta fort on the other side of the bay, was to protect the town from pirates with crossfire.
The fort was destroyed by Dutch pirates in 1662 when they burned Pampatar.
In 1664 Captain Carlos Navarro began the reconstruction of the castle after a design by military engineer Juan Betín.
In 1676 Juan Muñoz Gadea was appointed Governor of Margarita.
When he reached the island in August 1677 he found that it had been devastated earlier in the year by a privateering raid by the French Marquis de Maintenon. Gadea focused all available resources, including some of his own funds, on completing and manning Fort San Carlos.
The work was eventually completed in 1684.
In subsequent years the castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times.
La Caranta was destroyed by pirates in 1626. The ruins remain.
During the Venezuelan War of Independence the revolutionary Luisa Cáceres de Arismendi was held in the castle in 1816 while being moved from the Castillo de Santa Rosa in La Asunción to the prison in La Guaira on the mainland. She is considered the heroine of the war of independence, and her remains are now in the National Pantheon of Venezuela.
On 3 November 1816 the Spanish were forced to evacuate Isla Margarita.
After boarding all the soldiers and supplies, they left a lighted fuse leading to a pile of gunpowder that would have destroyed the castle.
A revolutionary soldier noticed the fuse by accident and extinguished it before any damage was done.
The next year the Spanish under General Pablo Morillo returned to the island and made the fort their headquarters during a campaign to regain control.
However, after six weeks in which the islanders reverted to guerrilla warfare the Spanish returned to the mainland.
Structure
The castle is a classical example of contemporary military architecture, typical of fortifications built along the coast of Venezuela during that period.
The fort has thick stone walls.
The square structure has four observation towers, one at each corner.
The base is star-shaped. The coastal battery consisted of a dozen cannon pointing across the bay.
There is a moat around the fort, but it was never practical to fill it with water.
Today
San Carlos de Borromeo Castle has been renovated and is now a museum.
Many of the fort's rooms were made into exhibition areas.
The restoration was completed in 1968.
The museum includes paintings of heroes of the War of Independence, and of events in the war.
One commemorates the Battle of Matasiete, and is the most popular item in the collection.
In this battle, fought on 31 July 1817, revolutionary forces under General Francisco Esteban Gómez defeated Spanish Royalist forces under the command of General Morillo outside La Asunción, a few miles to the northwest.
There are also old weapons and a replica of Christopher Columbus's boat, the Santa María.
The museum also has a collection of memorabilia of Luisa Caceres de Arismendi.

The 2020 French motorcycle Grand Prix (officially known as the SHARK Helmets Grand Prix de France) was the tenth round of the 2020 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, the ninth round of the 2020 MotoGP World Championship and the fifth round of the 2020 MotoE World Cup, which represent the end of the season for the MotoE class. It was held at the Bugatti Circuit in Le Mans on 11 October 2020.
Spaniard Jordi Torres won the MotoE World Cup in the second race.
Italian Danilo Petrucci won the MotoGP with a time of 45:54.736 on his Ducati. Notably, Spaniard Joan Mir lost his balance on entering a left turn and slid on his side for about 50 metres before managing to use the momentum as he entered the gravel pit to seamlessly regain his footing and fluidly transfer his momentum into a running action. Mir was still able to come 11th and salvage 5 points. Mir's smooth recovery became a popular internet meme in various incarnations.
Background
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
The opening rounds of the 2020 championship were heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

MotoGP Championship standings before the race
After his victory in the Catalan Grand Prix, Fabio Quartararo climbed to the top of the drivers' standings with 108 points, 8 points ahead of Joan Mir and 18 over Maverick Viñales. Andrea Dovizioso, previous leader of the classification, due to the accident with Johann Zarco in the Catalan race, fell to fourth place with 84 points, followed by Franco Morbidelli with 77 points.
In the team championship, Petronas Yamaha SRT with 185 points leads the Suzuki Ecstar Team Championship with 160. Monster Energy Yamaha is third with 148 points, followed by the Ducati Team and Pramac Racing with 123 and 118 points respectively.

The 1985 Orange Bowl was the 51st edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday, January 1. Part of the 1984–85 bowl game season, it matched the fourth-ranked Washington Huskies of the Pacific-10 Conference and the #2 Oklahoma Sooners of the Big Eight Conference. Underdog Washington rallied
Teams
Washington
The Huskies (10–1) had risen back from a loss at USC on November 10 that knocked them from the top spot in both polls to fourth and cost them the Pac-10 title and the accompanying berth in the Rose Bowl. This was the first appearance by a Pac-10 team in the Orange Bowl and remains the Huskies' only appearance.
Oklahoma
The Sooners (9–1–1) tied rival Texas but were upset at Kansas. They won the Big Eight title for the ninth time in twelve seasons and were making their fifth Orange Bowl appearance in eight seasons; they were favored in this game by six points.
Game summary
Danny Greene gave the Huskies an early lead on his 29-yard touchdown catch from quarterback Paul Sicuro, and tailback Jacque Robinson made it after one quarter on his touchdown plunge. Sooner quarterback Danny Bradley cut the lead with a touchdown sneak, and Derrick Shepard tied the game before halftime on his 61-yard catch from Bradley for a touchdown.
The third quarter was scoreless, and Tim Lashar's 35-yard field goal gave Oklahoma a lead with under nine minutes remaining. After Sicuro was intercepted for a third time, Hugh Millen took over at quarterback for Washington in the fourth quarter. He guided the Huskies on a drive in seven plays, capped by a twelve-yard pass to Mark Pattison in the end zone for a four-point lead with less than six minutes to go. The Sooners muffed the ensuing kickoff return and started at their own two; Washington intercepted a tipped Bradley pass deep in Oklahoma territory and soon scored again on a touchdown run by fullback Rick Fenney to make the
The Sooner Schooner Game
With the score tied early in the fourth quarter, Oklahoma attempted a short field goal, from 22 yards out. It was good, and the Sooner Schooner rode out onto the field, as was tradition for Sooner scores. However, the play was nullified due to an illegal procedure penalty on Oklahoma due to a player not reporting his temporary jersey number to the officials, which he was required to do before the ball was snapped.
Pulled by two Shetland ponies, the wagon got stuck on the wet grass, ending up in front of the Huskies' sideline, and the Sooners were assessed a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Lashar's ensuing 42-yard kick was blocked, keeping the game tied
The Orange Bowl had returned to natural grass years earlier in 1976; the Sooners' home field in Norman had artificial turf from 1970 through 1993.

He graduated from the Berberian College of Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1907 and then worked as a teacher in Armenian schools. Chogurian became known in 1910 with the publication of a collection of short stories entitled Voices from the Homeland (Հայրենի Ձայներ). In 1914 he published his most important work, the novel The Monastery (Վանքը), dedicated to the power and victory of civilization and freedom. He was arrested and killed in 1915 among a number of Armenian intellectuals.

The German tariff of 1879 was a protectionist law passed by the Reichstag (under the guidance of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck) that imposed tariffs on industrial and agricultural imports into Imperial Germany.
Background
Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Prussia had adopted low tariffs (including for grain) and these became the basis of the Zollverein tariff of 1834. In 1853 the duties on grain were abolished and in 1862 the commercial treaty with France (along with similar treaties with other states) substantially reduced the duties for manufactured goods. The Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871 established most favoured nation status between Germany and France. In 1873 free trade won its last victory in Germany with the abolition of the duty on iron. Tariffs were now for raising revenue and not for protective purposes, with the German Empire therefore almost a completely free-trading state. In 1850 two-thirds of Germany was employed in agriculture and this proportion declined slowly until 1870. During the 1850s and 1860s Germany was a net exporter of grain and its farmers opposed tariffs for industry as this might have led to reprisals by Britain against German grain. However, industrialists favoured tariffs against British goods to safeguard their infant industries and they therefore came to believe that winning over the farmers to protectionism was crucial.
After the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, France had to pay an indemnity to Germany. A considerable portion of the indemnity was paid in bills of exchange and in gold. This gave impetus to industry but it also led to over-production: the number of joint-stock companies in Prussia in 1870 was 410, with total capital of three milliard marks; by the end of 1874 there were 2,267 companies with capital amounting to seven and one-third milliards. The Panic of 1873, however, led to a depression, with low prices in Germany temporarily shielding it from foreign competition. Although prices began to rise with the subsequent economic recovery, this recovery was hampered by British manufacturers dumping their goods on the German market. German manufacturers renewed their demand for protection, with the textile and iron industries the most strongly in favour.
In the late 1870s world grain prices started to fall due to the opening up of the American prairies to cultivation following the settlement of the Midwest after the Civil War. The increase in railways also helped cheapen grain (which also aided Russian farmers). German grain started to lose ground and Germany became a net importer of wheat and rye. Agricultural labourers were migrating to the towns to find work in industry and landowners began to favour protection. The Prussian landowner Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck complained to Heinrich von Tiedemann about the sixfold increase in American grain, flour and meat exports "in truly unbelivable numbers, for German agriculture, there must be a grain, flour and meat tariff as an unconditional necessity if we are not to expose it to the same fluctuations as industry".
In 1876 both the Association of Tax and Economic Reformers (consisting mostly of large landowners) and the Central Association of German Industrialists were founded and in 1878 they combined to pressure the government into protecting both agriculture and industry. This coalition of interests into a solidarity bloc was called the marriage of iron and rye or the alliance of steel and rye. The autumn of 1878 witnessed a high-point in their protectionist campaign and in the Reichstag 204 deputies (including 87 Centrists, 36 Conservatives and 27 Liberals) formed a cross-party association in favour of protection. In October 1878 the Centre Party announced its support for protection. On 24 February 1879 the organisation of the largest 250 landowners—the Congress of German Landowners—also adopted protectionism. However, the Socialist Congress held in Gotha in 1876 declared that "the Socialists of Germany are indifferent to the controversy raging in the proprietary classes as to Protection and Free Trade; the problem is a practical one, and must be so considered in each particular case".
On 31 March 1878 Bismarck met Wilhelm von Kardorff, an industrialist and a landowner, informing him of his conversion to "moderate protective and finance tariffs". On 12 November he announced that the Bundesrat should appoint a Tariff Commission to draft tariff legislation. On 15 December Bismarck sent the committee a letter in which he stated that the financial object of the tariff was the reduction of direct taxation and the increase in indirect taxation. He estimated that if the tariff rates were 5 per cent. ad valorem the revenue they would yield would be about 70 million marks, roughly the same amount sent to the imperial exchequer by the federal states in 1878-79. He further argued:
I leave undecided the question whether complete mutual freedom of international commerce, such as is contemplated by the theory of Free Trade, would not serve the interests of Germany. But as long as most of the countries with which our trade is carried on surround themselves with customs barriers, which there is still a growing tendency to multiply, it does not seem to me justifiable, or to the economic interest of the nation, that we should allow ourselves to be restricted in the satisfaction of our financial wants by the apprehension that German products will thereby be slightly preferred to foreign ones.
Bismarck stated that a general tariff protecting native industry was superior to tariffs for particular industries because:
...its effects would be more equally spread over all the productive circles of the land than is the case with a system of protective duties for isolated branches of industry. The minority of the population, which does not produce at all, but exclusively consumes, will apparently be injured by a customs system favouring the entire national production. Yet if by means of such a system the aggregate sum of the values produced in the country increase, and thus the national wealth be on the whole enhanced, the non-producing parts of the population...will eventually be benefited.
In the Reichstag Bismarck announced that from henceforth the government's income would come from indirect rather than from direct taxation. Also, since "other states surround themselves with customs barriers it seems to me justified...that German products have a small advantage over foreign ones". The adoption of protectionism by Bismarck signalled a shift towards a greater reliance on the Conservatives for support rather than on the National Liberals. The tariff was supported by the two Conservative Parties and the Centre Party and opposed by the Progressives and the Socialists, with the Liberals divided. On 31 March Bismarck held a meeting with the Centrist deputy Ludwig Windthorst, where Bismarck agreed to relax the Kulturkampf against the Catholic Church in exchange for Centrist support for protection.
The committee that drafted the tariff legislation was chaired by Georg Freiherr von und zu Franckenstein. He gave his name to a clause in the legislation that limited to 130 million marks as the maximum amount the central government could receive from customs revenue and the tobacco duty. The remaining amount would go to the federal states. On 9 July 1879 the Reichstag voted for the Franckenstein clause by 211 votes to 122 against. On 12 July the tariff bill was voted for by a majority of 100.
Rates
The tariff imposed moderate import duties on grain and raised the duties on livestock products. Wheat, rye and oats were subject to a duty of 1 mark per 100kg; on barley and maize 50 pfennigs; on flour 2 marks; on meat 12 marks; on oxen 20 marks; sheep 1 mark; pigs 25 marks. Raw materials for industry such as cotton, flax, hemp, wool and coal were admitted duty free. The duty on pig iron was 1 mark; on semi-manufactured goods made from iron and steel it ranged from 2 to 2.5 marks; for other iron and steel goods the duty ranged from 7.5 to 15 marks. On machinery it was 3 to 8 marks; for yarns and textiles the rates were 15 to 30 per cent. ad valorem.
Effects
The tariff protected the great landowners east of the Elbe—the Ostelbier or Junkers—from competition from cheap American grain. Without protection many of these landowners would have declined; the tariff preserved the economic existence and the political ascendancy of the Junker class. Many working men considered the tariff a tax on their food and along with the Anti-Socialist Laws that banned the Social Democratic Party, the tariff helped alienate the working class from the state. The historian Erich Eyck argued that if Germany's political culture at the beginning of the 20th century differed from that in Western Europe, agricultural protection was largely responsible.

Arthur Capper (July 14, 1865 – December 19, 1951) was an American politician from Kansas. He was the 20th governor of Kansas (the first born in the state) from 1915 to 1919 and a United States senator from 1919 to 1949. He also owned a radio station (WIBW in Topeka), and was the publisher of a newspaper, the Topeka Daily Capital.
Life and career
Capper was born in Garnett, Kansas. He attended the public schools and learned the art of printing. He became a newspaper publisher, eventually owning several newspapers and two radio stations. The best known of his publications, Capper's Weekly, had an enormous readership among farm families and served as the base of his political support in Kansas. Capper's continues today as a bimonthly glossy magazine that focuses on rural living.
Capper first entered politics in 1912 when he became the Republican candidate for governor of Kansas. In addition to a reputation built from his newspapers, he was also the son-in-law of former governor Samuel J. Crawford. He was defeated by Democrat George H. Hodges. However, Capper was elected governor in the next election in 1914 and served as governor of Kansas from 1915 until 1919, winning re-election in 1916. He was the first native Kansan to serve as the state's governor.
Having served two full terms as governor, Capper was not permitted to run for a third term by the Kansas State Constitution. Instead, in 1918 he ran for election to the United States Senate and won. Capper became a long-serving senator, representing Kansas for five 6-year terms. He was in the Senate from 1919 to 1949, and prominent among Republicans who supported the relief efforts and other policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration. He did not seek reelection in 1948.
Capper was particularly interested in issues relating to agriculture. Before his time as governor, he served as president of the Board of Regents of Kansas State Agricultural College (now known as Kansas State University) from 1910 to 1913. While in the United States Senate, he at times served as chairman of the Committee of Expenditures of the Department of Agriculture and the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. He also at times served as chairman of the Committee on Claims and the Committee on the District of Columbia. In the latter role he played a crucial part in starting the D.C. Alley Dwelling Authority in 1934, the first housing authority in the country. He co-sponsored the Capper–Volstead Act. In 1923 Senator Capper brought forward a constitutional amendment with an anti-miscegenation provision outlawing mixed-race marriages, but struck out the passage after protest from African-American organizations and stated it was an unnecessary troublemaker. The withdrawal of this section by the Senator was made easier because he himself did not write the bill. It was drawn by the attorney of the American Federation of Women's Clubs.
In April 1943 a confidential analysis by British scholar Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office described Capper as:
Capper became chairman of the Senate's Agriculture Committee in 1946; by that point, at the age of 81, he was nearly deaf and his speech was difficult to understand. He joined the Congressional Flying Club in 1947 at the age of 82 and took up flying lessons, as the oldest member of Congress, from Mrs. Pearle Robinson part owner of the Hybla Valley Airport just outside of Washington, D.C.
After retiring from the Senate, Capper returned to his home in Topeka, Kansas, where he continued in the newspaper publishing business until his death. He was buried in Topeka Cemetery in a plot adjacent to Governor Crawford.
Capper publications
Arthur Capper was the owner of the Capper Building in Topeka, Kansas, and the Capper publications, which over time included the Daily Capital (Topeka, Kansas), the North Topeka Mail, the Kansas Breeze (which later merged with the Mail to form Farmers Mail and Breeze), Missouri Valley Farmer, Capper's Weekly, Nebraska Farm Journal, Missouri Ruralist, Oklahoma Farmer, and The Household Magazine.
A collection of his correspondences includes two letters of complaint from inmates at Parsons State Hospital.

As in the previous two seasons, the competition was organised in a knockout format. Teams played each other on a home and away basis, with the aggregate points winner proceeding to the next round. The final was a single leg. This was the final season with a pure knockout format; in subsequent seasons the competition reverted to a pool stage followed by a knockout.
For the third and final time, a third tier tournament was held - the European Shield. This was contested between the first round losers from the European Challenge Cup. As there were only 28 teams involved, the 2 "best" 1st Round losers were reprieved and proceeded to the 2nd Round.
The defending champions, England's NEC Harlequins, did not have a chance to defend their crown because they qualified to play in the Heineken Cup. Sale Sharks claimed a comfortable victory over Pau in the final and picked up their second piece of European Club silverware.
Teams
The allocation of teams was as follows:
England: 5 teams — all teams from the Zurich Premiership that did not qualify for the 2004–05 Heineken Cup
France: 10 teams — all teams from the Top 16 that did not qualify for the Heineken Cup
Ireland: 1 team — the Irish team from the Celtic League that did not play in the Heineken Cup

was a Japanese samurai, Shinto priest, and adherent of kokugaku. His courtesy name was initially , but he deferentially changed it to after realizing the original characters were present of the name of Empress Jingū's mausoleum.
Biography
Harukata was born under the name in the village of Takadahara, outside the walls of Kumamoto Castle. He was the first son of , a retainer of the Kumamoto Domain.
In 1851, when Harukata was 15, Yūsuke became embroiled in a local scandal and was obliged to perform seppuku. Due to this, the Kaya family was in serious danger of collapse. In his capacity as the eldest son, Harukata assumed leadership of the family. Relying on relatives for support, Harukata and his siblings lived in extreme poverty.
In 1858, Kaya entered the nativist school of Hayashi Ōen and became intensely devoted to Shinto. Through Ōen, Harukata became acquainted with the priest Ōtaguro Tomoo. Kaya was known to break down in tears of passion when discussing the welfare of the nation. In his daily visits to Shinto shrines he was most scrupulous, evidently never missing a single day of worship, and prayed that foreign nations be brought to total submission before Japan.
In 1862, when the Imperial Court requested that the Kumamoto domain contribute forces to guard the Imperial Enclosure in Kyoto, the troops dispatched to the capital included active loyalists such as Kaya and Kawakami Gensai. In 1865, he was thrown into prison upon his return to Kumamoto for obscure reasons. He was released from prison in 1867, the year of the formal surrender of temporal power to the young Emperor Meiji by shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu.
In 1868, Kaya was dispatched by the domainal authorities to Nagasaki in order to assess the situation there. There, he wrote a letter urging the Nagasaki magistrate not to open the port to foreign vessels and to repulse any attempts by foreigners to make landings. His letter was ignored, and he returned to Kumamoto in anguish.
After Ōen's death in 1870, the followers of his school established the , an anti-foreign militia, of which Kaya was a member. A year later, in 1871, Kaya was implicated in the end imprisoned, but was soon released.
In order to placate the increasing discontent of the Keishintō, Kumamoto governor Yasuoka Ryōsuke appointed members to positions as shrine priests. Kaya became a priest at the Nishikiyama Shrine. In 1876, Kaya wrote and submitted a long memorial to the central government protesting the Haitorei edict in which he asserted that the bearing of arms by the general populace was not only an integral part of the Japanese way of life and national identity, but necessary for the operation of the militia as a component of national defense. While other followers of the late Ōen advocated for an immediate uprising against government forces in the area, he remained a voice of moderation and an advocate for lawful opposition. However, after an ukehi performed by Ōtaguro, Kaya agreed to participate in the Keishintō's rebellion.
The Keishintō conducted a night attack on Kumamoto Castle on October 24 of that year, and Kaya was killed during the fighting on the premises. His age at death was reckoned as 41 years old due to the Japanese custom of counting a person as one year old at the time of birth. His grave is located in the castle's adjoining .

Kisii School is a public high school in Kisii, Kenya for boys. It was established in 1934 and is today a leading public school providing an education to students drawn from all over Kenya.
History
Kisii School was established in July 1934 as Government African School (GAS) Kisii. The previous year 1933, the governor of Kenya Sir Joseph Byrne visited Kisii and the leaders of the district presented to him a joint petition by the Luo/Suba Council and the Kisii/Kuria Council about their desire to have a Government school in Kisii. The governor asked them to pool resources and the government would assist them put up the school. In 1933, the joint session of the two councils (which would later merge and became known as the South Kavirondo Local Native Council), voted to provide Sh. 120,000 for the establishment of the school on a shared basis with an additional Sh. 3,000 for equipment. Nyaribari location chief Musa Nyandusi agreed to provide land for the construction of the school which was located just outside Kisii township. Work began in January 1934 led by teams of masons from the Kabete Industrial Training Depot and by July that year, the school was ready to take in the first pupils. Some 300 pupils from across the district were invited to sit an entrance examination for the first class in Standard III to be admitted in January 1935. They were competing for only 60 slots in the school. The pupils who passed were mainly from Luo Nyanza and the school being a joint project, the district commissioner ordered a retake of the examination to ensure that more Kisii and Kuria pupils would be admitted to the school.
Development of the School
1935- January: the first pupils sat in the Standard III class. Charles A. Berridge, a native of Canada, was appointed the first principal of the school. He remained at GAS Kisii until 1939 when he moved to Government African School Kitui.
1935- February: Governor Sir Joseph Byrne keeps his promise to open the school but falls ill and cancels at the last minute. He sent the acting Chief Native Commissioner Sydney Hugh La Fontaine to open the school on his behalf. La Fontaine was received by the district commissioner Major J.V. Dawson.
1938- Presented the first candidate for Primary School Examinations. By now, the school had 60 pupils in 2 streams of 30 each. The students had to be 50% Kisii and 50% Luo (Kisii 30 Pupils, Luo 30 pupils)
1945- The Secondary School section was started. At that time, this was called the Junior Secondary- equivalent to standard 7 and 8. The population was still 60 per class.

He personally organized to have the land on which the entire school stands procured for the purposes of developing the school. Together with Chief Paul Mboya of Karachuonyo, they petitioned the government for the establishment of the school. Nyandusi's son former cabinet minister the late Hon.

RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under is a reality competition streaming television series based on the American television series of the same name produced by World of Wonder and Warner Bros. International Television Production New Zealand. The show documents RuPaul and a panel of judges' search for "Down Under's next drag superstar". RuPaul plays several roles on the show including host, mentor and head judge for the series, as the contestants are given different challenges to participate in each week. The show also employs a panel of judges: RuPaul, Michelle Visage, and Rhys Nicholson. The series premiered on TVNZ 2 and TVNZ OnDemand in New Zealand, Stan in Australia, and on WOW Presents Plus internationally on 1 May 2021. The series is also streaming on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer in the United Kingdom, and broadcast by both Crave and its associated streaming service in Canada.
The ten drag queens compete for the title of the "Down Under's first Drag Superstar", a one-year supply of Revolution Beauty Cosmetics, and a cash prize of $30,000. The winner of the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under was Kita Mean.
In September 2021, the series was renewed for a second season. Casting closed on 5 October 2021.
TVNZ Director of Content Cate Slater said that TVNZ will be partnering with Stan, World of Wonder, Passion Distribution and Warner Bros. International Television Production New Zealand for another season of RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under, due to film in New Zealand and premiere in 2022.
Format
Like the American version, RuPaul has several roles within the show, acting as host, coach and judge. As the host, RuPaul introduces celebrity guests, announces the challenges the queens will take part in each week, and reveals who will be leaving the competition. For his role as a coach, RuPaul offers guidance to the contestants through each challenge, and as a judge he critiques the queens on their overall performance of the challenge. The show uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of ten contestants (series 1), down to the final four. Each episode follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a maxi challenge, a runway walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant.
Mini challenges
In mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from series to series, or repeated from the original American season. For instance, the first mini challenge is a photo shoot with a photographer or RuPaul himself, that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). One recurring mini challenge is dedicated to "reading", a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect, inspired by Paris Is Burning. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.
Maxi challenges and runways
The requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. The final maxi challenge consisted of the queens taking part in an all-singing and all-dancing routine to one of RuPaul's songs.
The goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the "Snatch Game" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities as a parody of Match Game), a ball or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people. The contestants walk down a runway presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.
Judging panel
A panel of judges casts opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.
RuPaul acted as both the host and main judge, with Michelle Visage and Rhys Nicholson as supporting judges.
The show made an unsuccessful attempt to book New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for some form of appearance, either as a guest judge or making a cameo appearance in the workroom. Ardern declined, citing scheduling issues.
Companion series
There are web series also accompanying each episode of Drag Race. How's Your Head, Queen?, features Michelle Visage checking in with the newly eliminated queen from RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under to chat about their experience, their passions, the future, and more. Fashion Photo Ruview, aired for the first season, co-hosted by Raja and Raven who evaluate the runway looks of the main show. Binge Queens with Kita Mean, Angeria Paris VanMicheals, Jasmine Kennedie and June Jambalaya who threw a couch kiki for a weekly watch party for RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under (season 2).

Frank Evans Heart (May 15, 1929 – June 24, 2018) was an American computer engineer influential in computer networking. After nearly 15 years working for MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Heart worked for Bolt, Beranek and Newman from 1966 to 1994, during which he led a team that designed the first routing computer for the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet.
Background
Born to a Jewish family in The Bronx, New York City, Heart grew up in Yonkers. His father was an engineer at the Otis Elevator Company; his mother was an insurance agent.
Entering as an electrical engineering major, Heart enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1947, entering a five-year master's degree program which he alternated semesters between work and school. During one summer, he worked as a power transformer tester at a General Electric factory. In 1951, he enrolled in MIT's new computer programming course taught by Gordon Welchman. Taking the course led Heart to complete his undergraduate coursework early. During his graduate studies, Heart was a research assistant on Whirlwind I, a computer that controlled an aircraft-tracking radar defense system; Whirlwind would be transferred to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the on-campus military contractor. Heart received both bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering in 1952.
Career
At Lincoln Lab, Heart remained as a staff member after completing his master's degree. Eventually, Heart became a team lead for projects in building real-time computing systems where measuring devices gathered data by phone lines connected to computers. Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon wrote about Heart's management style in their 1996 book Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet:
In 1966, Heart left Lincoln Lab after being recruited by research and development company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). In August 1968, BBN won a request for proposal from ARPA to build the first Interface Message Processor (IMP), a computer that transmitted data and interconnected a network known today as a router. Jerry Elkind assigned Heart to be project manager.
With Severo Ornstein as hardware lead and Will Crowther the software lead, Heart's team of ten engineers used a rugged Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer to engineer the IMP, whose special function was to switch data among the computers on the ARPANET. The team also invented remote diagnostics for computers by equipping IMPs with remote control capabilities. By September 6, 1968, Heart's team finalized the nearly 200-page, $100,000 IMP proposal, which was BBN's most expensive project to date. The first IMP was installed at the University of California, Los Angeles on September 1, Labor Day of 1969, and the second was installed at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California, a month later on October 1.
Heart, wrote Hafner and Lyon, had become "a highly regarded and valuable project manager" at BBN, because his teams had members "committed to a common mission rather than a personal agenda" and "who took personal responsibility for what they did." Influenced by working at Lincoln Lab for Jay Forrester, the inventor of core memory, Heart prioritized reliability over cost, performance, or other factors, being "a most defensive driver when it came to engineering." He also preferred that his programming teams code working products rather than simulations or software tools. By 1971, Heart's IMP team had grown to 30 and transitioned to a lighter Honeywell 316 for the IMP.
In 1972, Heart appeared in the ARPANET documentary Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing.
In 1989, the federal government decommissioned ARPANET. Most of the IMPs were disassembled; a few remain in museums and computer labs. However, many of Heart's core principles, such as reliability and error detection and correction, still exist within the Internet. Heart's final position at BBN was as president of the systems and technology division; he would retire from BBN by the summer of 1994.
In 2014, Heart was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.
Personal life
While working at Lincoln Laboratory, Heart met Jane Sundgaard, one of the company's first women programmers. They married in 1959 and had three children, and the family lived in Lincoln, Massachusetts, during Heart's career at BBN. Jane Heart died in 2014. On June 24, 2018, Frank Heart died of melanoma at age 89 in a retirement community in Lexington, Massachusetts.

No. 5, 1948 is a painting by Jackson Pollock, an American painter known for his contributions to the abstract expressionist movement. It was sold on 22 May 2006 for $140 million, a new mark for highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed until April 2011.
Composition
The painting was created on fibreboard, also known as composition board, measuring 8' x 4'. For the paint, Pollock chose to use liquid paints. More specifically, they were synthetic resin paints (gloss enamel) but are referred to as oil paints for classification of the work. On inspection it was grey, brown, white and yellow paint drizzled in a way that many people still perceive as a "dense bird's nest". Initial reactions to the work were underwhelming:
Damage and rework
The painting has been modified by Pollock since it was originally created. During January 1949, it was being shown in a solo Pollock show at the Betty Parsons gallery. It was from here that Alfonso A. Ossorio decided to purchase a "paint drip" composition; he chose No. 5, 1948 and paid $1,500. It was the only canvas sold from the show. At some point, presumably during the moving process, the painting became damaged, according to Grace Hartigan. "Home Sweet Home [the shipping company] came in with a painting in one hand and a lump of paint from the center of the painting in the other hand". Hartigan gave Pollock some paint and he patched the painting before it went to Ossorio, saying "He'll never know, never know". When the painting was subsequently delivered to Ossorio, he claimed that he noticed "a portion of the paint - actually the skin from the top of an opened paint can - had slid" leaving a "nondescript smear amidst the surrounding linear clarity," as he explained in a 1978 lecture at Yale. Pollock offered to rework the painting but, according to Hartigan, he "repainted the whole thing again" and stated that "He'll never know. No one knows how to look at my paintings, he won't know the difference." After three weeks, Ossorio visited Pollock's studio to inspect the painting. Ossorio was confronted with an artwork which was repainted onto fiberboard, with "new qualities of richness and depth" as a result of Pollock's "thorough but subtle repainting." It was clear that Ossorio still liked the painting despite the rework, and continued to attest that the "original concept remained unmistakably present, but affirmed and fulfilled by a new complexity and depth of linear interplay. It was, and still is a masterful display of control and disciplined vision." Pollock repaired the damage to the painting by completely repainting the original, in contrast to how other artworks are repaired. The reconstruction had not only retained but reinforced the metaphysical concept of the painting, and has become what Ossorio calls "a wonderful example of an artist having a second chance".

According to a report in The New York Times on November 2, 2006, the painting was sold by David Geffen, founder of Geffen Records and co-founder of DreamWorks SKG, to David Martinez, managing partner of Fintech Advisory Ltd, in a private sale for a record inflation-adjusted price of $140 million. It is speculated that Geffen sold the painting, along with two others, to raise enough funds to bid for the Los Angeles Times.
The sale was reportedly brokered by Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer, however, the law firm of Shearman & Sterling, LLP, issued a press release on behalf of its client, David Martinez, to announce that contrary to recent articles in the press, Martinez does not own the painting or any rights to acquire it. In addition to the refutation issued by Shearman & Sterling, the auction expert Josh Baer indicated that Martinez was not the buyer of the painting.
Popular references
The lyrics of The Stone Roses song "Going Down" include a reference to the painting: "(There) she looks like a painting - Jackson Pollock's Number 5..." The Stone Roses' guitarist John Squire created cover artwork for many of the band's releases on Silvertone Records in a style similar to that of Jackson Pollock.
The painting played a central role in the film Ex Machina (2015), in which billionaire tech firm CEO Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) owns the painting and uses it as an object lesson for the protagonist Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), noting that No. 5, 1948 would never have come into existence if Jackson Pollock only painted what he already knew. This is contrasted to the way an AI comes to know, thus emphasizing the problem of consciousness and epistemology.

The Schneider ES-60 Boomerang is a single-seat glider that was designed and manufactured in Australia in the 1960s. It is constructed of wood and fabric. It was designed and manufactured by Edmund Schneider Pty Ltd of Adelaide, South Australia. It has a fixed main wheel and a tail skid. The Boomerang has an all-moving, swept tailplane that resembles a boomerang and hence the name given to the ES-60. A version with a conventional straight stabiliser and moving elevator was also manufactured, called the ES-60B Super Arrow.
In the 1950s Edmund Schneider Pty Ltd manufactured a number of Schleicher Ka 6 gliders, under licence from Alexander Schleicher of Germany. However, the Ka 6 with its low wing loading proved to be unsuited as a competition glider in Australia's strong summer thermal conditions. The Gliding Federation of Australia asked Edmund Schneider to design and manufacture a competition sailplane better suited to Australian conditions. The result was the ES-60 Boomerang.

Cedar Mill was a cotton spinning mill in the Hurst area of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, in England. It was built between 1903 and 1905 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. It was the last mill in Ashton spinning cotton. It ceased in 1980. It was demolished and the land was used for housing.
Location
Cedar mill was built on Alderley Street, Hurst, to the north of Ashton.
History
The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate. The syndicate went on to build the Rock Mill, Atlas Mill, Curzon Mill and the Tudor Mill. Cedar Mill was built with a capital of 70,000 GBP. It was their sixth mill. It installed its machinery in July 1905. The Cedar Mill Company went into voluntary liquidation 7 January 1921 became part of the Atlas Mills Limited. The final mill built by the syndicate was Texas Mill.
The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914–1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Atlas Mills Limited was taken over by the LCC in 1929. Thus, Cedar Mill was one of 104 mills brought into LCC ownership, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. Ownership passed to Courtaulds Northern Textiles in the 1960s and it was still spinning cotton until 1980, making it the last cotton spinning mill in Ashton.
Architecture
This was a Sydney Stott building. It was five-storeys high built on a basement, built of engineering brick with yellow brick decoration. It had large rectangular windows grouped in threes on the long sides and twos on the others: 30 windows long and 16 windows wide. It was 198 ft by 136 ft. There was an ornamental water tower. The engine and boiler house were to the east. The chimney was round and displayed the two rings that were a trademark of a Sydney Stott mill.
Power
The steam engine was a 1500 hp triple expansion vertical engine by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw built in 1905. It had a 22 ft flywheel that operated at 75 rpm. The flywheel drove 28 ropes that transmitted the power to each floor. The cylinders all had Corliss valves. They had a 48 in throw, the High pressure was 20" in diameter, the intermediate was 32 in and the low pressure was 50 in. The air pump was driven from the low pressure crosshead, there was a Saxon governor on the high pressure end of the bed. The boilers operated at 120psi.
Usage
Cedar Mill was used for spinning 50s counts of twists from Egyptian cotton, for the hosiery and manufacturing market.

The Ulla Ulla National Reserve - which today is part of Apolobamba Integrated Management Natural Area - was created in 1972 with an extension of 240,000 ha, a biosphere reserve located in the Franz Tamayo Province, in the Department of La Paz in western Bolivia.
The Reserve is on the high Andean plain northwest of the city of La Paz, with an average elevation of over 4000 meters above sea level. Its western border is the political border with Peru. The park is about 2,000 km² in size and is populated by about 12,000 people, most of them of Aymara origin. The park protects part of the Central Andean wet puna ecoregion. It is also the home of the Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) (reportedly the largest flying bird in the world), as well as significant populations of alpacas, and the largest group of vicuñas (Vicugna vicugna) in Bolivia.
The park was designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1977.

The grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis) is a species of bird in the family Pomatostomidae.
It is found in Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea.
Its natural habitats are temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
Taxonomy
Two subspecies are recognised within Australia and New Guinea.
Pomatostomus temporalis temporalis – This subspecies occurs within Australia in the states of Victoria, eastern Queensland (including Cape York), New South Wales and south-eastern South Australia. It is a vagrant or accidental visitor to the Australian Capital Territory. It is also the subspecies believed to occur within New Guinea.
Pomoatostomus temporalis rubeculus – This subspecies occurs in Australia within the states of Western Australia, Northern Territory, western Queensland and a small area of northern South Australia.
The breast color is usually used as the distinguishing morphological character between the subspecies, with a creamy white breast grading to mid-grey in P. t. temporalis and a mid to deep rufous brown breast in P. t. rubeculus. Other differences relate to brow coloration, facial bands through the eye, tail length and overall size. A zone of intergradation occurs between the two subspecies in north-central Queensland.
Naming
A number of alternate names have been provided for the grey-crowned babbler.
Yahoo – This popular alternate name is based on the distinctive call of the grey-crowned babbler. The source of this name is unclear.
Grey-crowned chatterer – Name given by A. J. North
Happy-Jack – Popular name, quoted by A. J. North and others, relating to the species habitat of moving about in 'talkative' family groups. Source of this name is not known.
Dog-bird, Barker, Barking-bird – Popular names whose sources are not known. Presumably named due to cackling soft tuk note.
Conservation status
Australia
There are numerous lists of threatened fauna from within Australia. The official list of threatened species on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 does not consider the grey-crowned babbler (either as a species or subspecies) to be threatened.
From other sources, the national status of the grey-crowned babbler varies. The eastern subspecies is increasingly being considered threatened, although not by all:
The Directory of Australian Birds considers both subspecies of the grey-crowned babbler to be secure.
The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000 considers the eastern subspecies (P. t. temporalis) to be near-threatened. Within this document, this subspecies was considered to be near-threatened using criteria 'a' of Maxwell et al. (1996). That is, this subspecies has disappeared from over 50% of its former area of occupancy and/or extent of occurrence and are at risk of further decline. Although there has been little evident change at the northern edge of its range, the subspecies has been declining noticeably in the southern half of its range
The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000 considers the north-western subspecies (P. t. rubeculus) to be of the least concern.
States of Australia
The conservation status of the grey-crowned babbler varies from state to state within Australia. For example:
The grey-crowned babbler is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the grey-crowned babbler is listed as endangered.
The eastern subspecies of the grey-crowned babbler (P. t. temporalis) is listed as vulnerable on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.<ref>[http://www.threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/profile.aspx?id=10660 Grey-crowned Babbler Species Profile, Department of Conservation and Environment, State of NSW]</ref> This is the only subspecies occurring within NSW.
The grey-crowned babbler is listed on schedule 9 (rare species) of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972.
The grey-crowned babbler is not listed as a threatened species on the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950.
The grey-crowned babbler is listed as least conservation on the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992.
Threats
The key process that has led to the decline of the eastern subspecies of the grey-crowned babbler has been the historic loss and fragmentation of its preferred woodland habitat. Grey-crowned babblers generally have a poor ability to immigrate across unsuitable habitats. As a consequence of fragmentation, breeding success and groups sizes decline. Babbler groups are more susceptible to stochastic events leading to local extinction from a fragment. Once a fragment has lost its population of grey-crowned babblers, natural recolonisation rarely occurs because of the species' poor dispersal ability.

The Boston Art Commission, established in 1890, exercises legal authority to approve and site new public art on property owned by the City of Boston. Woven through the urban landscape, site-specific artworks identify Boston as a place with long history and a great capacity for innovation. These artworks, both permanent and temporary, range from traditional and new media public art pieces to municipal design elements, such as wayfinding systems and artistic lighting. In addition, the Art Commission has care and custody of all paintings, murals, statues, bas-reliefs, sculptures, monuments, fountains, arches and other permanent structures intended for ornament or commemoration on City property. It is the conviction of the Boston Art Commission that, in order to engender and support a thriving artistic consciousness within the city, community involvement shall extend beyond everyday appreciation to meaningful engagement in the creation, evolving interpretation and ongoing care of artworks throughout Boston's neighborhoods.
The Art Commission is appointed by the Mayor and consists of nine Boston residents, each nominated by a Boston cultural institution. Art Commission meetings are held on the second Tuesday of each month.
Collections
Boston's wide range of public art works mirror key cultural debates and the ever-progressing political and social conditions of the city and the nation. Today, artists and community members work with the Mayor's Office and the Boston Art Commission to ensure that Boston's public art conveys the diversity of the city's past and current populations. The community aspect of initiating a piece of public art is critical in Boston and the city emphasizes community organizing and neighborhood projects supported by the Mayor's office through Neighborhood Coordinators. Therefore, the majority of public art pieces begin as a community effort in which the selection of a site, artist, and design are reliant on community support and participation. Additionally, the Art Commission strives to promote a varied selection of artistic styles and media. Art Commission archives, as well as the City Archives in West Roxbury, are open to the public by appointment.
PaintBox Program
PaintBox aims to highlight local artists within their community and, in doing so, brighten up the streets and deter the vandalization of utility boxes. Through PaintBox, the Art Commission asks Boston artists to get out on the streets of their neighborhoods and help create an ongoing dialogue about art by painting utility boxes. The individual boxes may vary in theme and technique depending on the artist, but as the program is city-wide, PaintBox has become a dynamic art installation in itself. This program is privately funded through corporate donations and uses no tax dollars.

Lou Reizner (born Chicago 1934, died London 26 June 1977) was a record producer, A&R executive and head of Mercury Records European operations. He produced Rod Stewart's first two solo albums, the orchestral version of The Who's rock opera Tommy, and Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Centre of the Earth. As an A&R executive, he signed Van der Graaf Generator and arranged a US deal for David Bowie.
Early career
Born in Chicago, Reizner started off as a singer and recorded a 7-track EP of classic cowboy songs entitled 'Chante Cow-Boy' for the French label Le Chant Du Monde, before going to work for Mercury Records.
He produced Dick Campbell's debut album Dick Campbell Sings Where Its At in 1965, using Mike Bloomfield and The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, who had previously backed Bob Dylan, to give a Dylanesque sound. Reizner was a keen talent spotter, and moved to England in 1966 where he produced Big Jim Sullivan. He gave the Greek Rock band Aphrodite's Child their name. He signed and produced The Eyes of Blue, introducing them to Quincy Jones and collaborated with them on the soundtrack of the film The Toy Grabbers (released in the US as "Mother"). He also arranged for the Eyes to score the music to, and appear in, the film "Connecting Rooms", and used them as a backing band, when, having signed Buzzy Linhart, he produced his album Buzzy in 1968. The same year, he produced the Buddy Miles Express debut album Expressway to Your Skull.
In October 1968 he signed Rod Stewart to his first solo contract and produced his first two albums An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down (called The Rod Stewart Album in the US) and Gasoline Alley. He signed Smile (a precursor to Queen) and was executive producer on their 1969 recordings, although, other than a US single "Earth" they were not released until 1998, long after his death. He also signed Van der Graaf Generator to Mercury Records in 1968, and arranged a US contract for David Bowie. He even co-wrote, sang on and produced two tracks for the film The Italian Job (another Quincy Jones film), which were issued as a single in 1969. In 1970 he signed Strawberry Dust and co-produced their album Women and Children First with John Weathers, renaming the band Ancient Grease for the album release. The album and band failed but the band later evolved into Racing Cars.
Reizner's output was extremely varied. In 1971 he produced Brazilian Tropicalismo artist Caetano Veloso's third self-titled album (his 1971 album or A Little More Blue); Third of a Lifetime by hard rock band Three Man Army; Wishful Thinking's album Hiroshima and its title song "Hiroshima", (which became a hit for Sandra in Germany in 1990), and Dave Morgan's solo album Morgan.
Symphonic rock
He then conceived and produced the orchestral version of The Who's rock opera Tommy. Tommy was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra with the English Chamber Choir, conducted by David Measham and arranged by Will Malone. The album was launched at a live performance on 9 December 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, London, with The LSO, The ECC, The Who and an all star cast. This, "the orchestrated Tommy was to be Lou's crowning achievement".
The double album was issued in a lavish box set, with a full colour booklet including the story, the lyrics and illustrations of the cast in character, "which was at the time the most elaborate album package yet created", and which won the Best Album Package Grammy in 1974.
Whilst still producing hard rock bands such as Three Man Army, Reizner also continued his symphonic rock work, with Rick Wakeman's concept album Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Issued in 1974, this also featured the LSO and the ECC, conducted by Measham and arranged by Malone.
Film soundtracks
The success of these extravagant productions encouraged him to work on the soundtrack to All This and World War II, a 1976 film comprising 20th Century Fox World War II newsreels, set to Beatles songs, re-recorded by current artists such as The Bee Gees, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Peter Gabriel. Although the film fared badly, the soundtrack album charted in the UK and US. The album included Elton John's version of "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds", which had been issued in 1974, and Rod Stewart's version of "Get Back" which became a UK hit single. The film also includes a Will Malone & Reizner cover of "You Never Give Me Your Money".
Reizner went on to produce the music to the 1977 film Black Joy featuring Gladys Knight and the Pips, Aretha Franklin, The Drifters and The O'Jays. He was still working prolifically, when he died of colon cancer, in June 1977.

Brimfield is a village and in north Herefordshire, England. The village lies on the A49 road at the border with Shropshire.
To the south, near the hamlet of Ashton, excavations at the site of Ashton Castle have revealed traces of a large stone enclosure castle. Less than a mile to the north of this site are the earthwork remains of a medieval motte.
The parish has a pub called The Roebuck Inn.
Wyson is west of Brimfield and is part of its civil parish. To the north, in Shropshire, is Woofferton.
The A49 ran through the village until a by-pass was built in 1982–83; the A49 now passes to the west, between Brimfield and Wyson.
The village had a local store in its centre on Wyson Lane which served bread baked on site. The store was initially named A.A. Francis after Annie Amelia, later renamed R.R. Francis after her son Ronald Robert and then R. B. Francis after his son. The store closed and was sold to housing developers in 1996. Villagers later reinstated a local store annexed to The Roebuck which thrives today.
The village also had a local Post Office which ran for over 100 years out of a building next door to The Roebuck which has been carefully restored as a residential premise called The Old Post Office. The Post Office facility now runs out of the Village Hall.
These facilities and other various local landmarks such as The Foundry are depicted on a quilted display in the local church, St. Michael's.
A penny sweet shop was run by a Mrs Humphreys opposite St. Michael's Gate.
There is a vibrant local community offering many services in the Village Hall and support to inhabitants, including a long-running Grapevine newsletter.

The Joseph P. O. Sullivan House is a historic house at 142 S. 17th Avenue in Maywood, Illinois. The house was built circa 1895 by the Proviso Land Association for Joseph P. O. Sullivan. The Proviso Land Association was the second land developer to invest in Maywood, after the Maywood Company; most homes built by the Association have been demolished, making the Sullivan House a rare example of their work. Like many of the Association's homes, the Sullivan House has an American Foursquare design. The house has a rectangular two-story layout with a front porch, a projecting bay on one side, a hip roof, and a dormer with a classical Palladian window.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1992.

Kirill Poluektovich Naryshkin () (1623 – April 30, 1691) was the maternal grandfather of Peter the Great.
Kirill Naryshkin's name was first mentioned in 1646, when he and Prince Nikita Ivanovich Odoyevsky were dispatched to guard the southern borders of Muscovy against possible attacks by the Crimean Tatars. In 1654, Kirill Naryshkin participated in Alexei Mikhailovich's military campaign against Poland and Lithuania. In 1656, he joined Prince Yuri Baryatinsky in his Orsha campaign. In 1658, Kirill Naryshkin served as head of a Streltsy unit in Smolensk. In 1660, he was sent to the Terek region as a commander to repel the attacks of the rebellious Nogais. In 1662, Kirill Naryshkin was sent to Kazan to serve as a second voyevoda of Prince M.P. Shuleshov.
The tsar's marriage to Naryshkin's daughter Natalia Kirillovna in 1671 greatly affected the lives of the Naryshkins. Summoned to Moscow, Kirill Naryshkin attended the wedding of his daughter and then received numerous gifts and awards. That same year, he was conferred the title of a dumniy dvoryanin (3rd rank in Boyar Duma after boyars and okolnichys), only to become an okolnichy a year later (together with Artamon Matveev) on the day tsarevich Peter was born. Around the same time, Kirill Naryshkin was granted large estates and a very substantial salary.
Again in 1671, Naryshkin (under the command of Yuri Alexeyevich Dolgorukov) participated in the pacifying of the Nizhny Novgorod region after the Razin rebellion. After his raise to the rank of a boyar on November 27, 1672, Kirill Naryshkin never really played any significant role at the royal court or in political life of the Tsardom of Russia, only occasionally overseeing Moscow during the tsar's pilgrimages to different monasteries or trips to the surrounding countryside. Naryshkin, however, held the post of a chief magistrate at the Grand Palace Prikaz (Приказ большого дворца).
During the reign of Feodor III of Russia, Kirill Naryshkin seems to have stopped taking part in the life of the royal court (possibly, due to the intrigues of the Miloslavskys), because we do not see him among guests at formal dinners or receptions of foreign ambassadors. He attended, however, the Sobor of 1682, convocated for the purpose of abolishing the mestnichestvo, and was among the ones who signed its final resolution (соборное деяние). During the Streltsy Uprising of 1682, Kirill Naryshkin had to suffer through several personal tragedies. His sons were killed during the rebellion and then he himself was forced by the Streltsy to take monastic vows under the name of Kiprian (Cyprian) and banished to Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery.
Upon the enthronement of his grandson Peter I, Kirill Naryshkin could have returned to the royal court, but chose to remain within the monastery walls due to his venerable age. He died at the monastery on April 30, 1691. His wife – Anna Leontyevna Naryshkina – died on July 2, 1706, and was interred at Vysokopetrovsky Monastery.

An operational context (OLC) for an operation is the external environment that influences its operation. For a mobile application, the OLC is defined by the combined hardware/firmware/software configurarions of several appliances or devices, as well as the bearer of the mobiles of these units and other work position environment this person as the key stakeholder makes use of in timely, spatial and modal coincidence.
This concept differs from the operating context and does not address the operating system of computers.
Example
The classic example is defined by the electronic leash configuration, where one mobile appliance is wirelessly tethered to another such appliance. The function of this electronic leash is to set an aural alarm with any of these two in case of unintentional leaving one of these two behind.
Implementing the example
Several suppliers offer the electronic leash solution. A new aspect has been launched with Bluetooth low energy for better economised battery life cycle. Special trimming serves for two years operation from a button cell.

Commissioning is the process of assuring that all systems and components of a building or industrial plant are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client.
For large projects, this process usually comprises planning, execution, and control of hundreds of thousands of inspection and test activities on “commissionable objects”, such as instruments, equipment, skids, modules, circuits, loops, subsystems, and systems. In this case, the large volume and complexity of commissioning data, and the need to guarantee information traceability, normally require the use of powerful IT tools, known as commissioning management systems or completion management systems.
Although these systems allow effective planning, management and monitoring of commissioning activities, as well as logging of all evidences necessary to the process they are not without a cost, as annual, monthly or per-user license fees and can typically range from upwards of 10000 USD/year to 5 USD/day/user to unlimited use for 160 USD/month. The design of these systems can also vary greatly, from rich native applications that need to be installed on a computer to lightweight web-based systems that can be accessed from any web browser or mobile solutions that only require a smartphone to access the relevant information. Choosing one of these solutions is entirely dependent on the needs of the project and its users due to specific benefits and drawbacks from choosing either.

Samoan culture tells stories of many different deities. There were deities of the forest, the seas, rain, harvest, villages, and war. There were two types of deities, atua, who had non-human origins, and aitu, who were of human origin.
Tagaloa was a supreme god who made the islands and the people. Mafuiʻe was the god of earthquakes. There were also a number of war deities. Nafanua, Samoa's warrior goddess hails from the village of Falealupo at the western end of Savai'i island, which is also the site of the entry into Pulotu, the spirit world. She also is regarded as a peace bringer, having brought peace to Savai'i through winning the wars between the two regions of the island. Tilafaiga is the mother of Nafanua. Nafanua's father, Saveasi'uleo, was the god of Pulotu. Another well-known legend tells of two sisters, Tilafaiga, the mother of Nafanua, and Taema, bringing the art of tattooing to Samoa from Fiti.
A figure of another legend is Tui Fiti, who resides at Fagamalo village in the village district of Matautu. The village of Falelima is associated with a dreaded spirit deity called, Nifoloa. The Mata o le Alelo 'Eyes of the Demon' freshwater pool from the Polynesian legend Sina and the Eel is situated in the village of Matavai on the northern coast in the village district of Safune.
Fetu ("star") is the god of the night. His wife is Ele'ele.
Samoan mythology is a variant of a more general Polynesian mythology in the Samoa Islands.

Richard Liversidge, naturalist, ornithologist and museum director, was born on 17 September 1926 in Blantyre, Nyasaland (now Malawi), and died on 15 September 2003 in Kimberley, South Africa.
Early career
As a youngster, Liversidge lived for various periods in India, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and it was as a schoolboy that his interest in birds originated. His initial training, however, was in engineering, when he was apprenticed as a fitter and turner. He began at the University of Cape Town, in engineering, in 1946. Working full-time as a technician at the university, he then commenced studies in zoology and botany, one subject a year, finally graduating in 1955. He took up an appointment as ornithologist at the Port Elizabeth Museum, where he began his study of the ecology of the Cape bulbul which in due course he wrote up for a PhD.
Subsequently, Liversidge worked as a conservator with the Natal Parks Board.
Richard Liversidge was the first curator at, and guiding spirit behind, the Tsitsikamma National Park on the south Cape coast.
McGregor Museum, Kimberley
In June 1966, Richard Liversidge was appointed as Director of the McGregor Museum in Kimberley. This was a position he held until his retirement in 1986, whereafter he continued to serve the museum as a Research Associate and as a member of the Board of Trustees.
During Liversidge's directorship, the McGregor Museum underwent unprecedented growth. It was at this time that the museum acquired two important historic homes in Kimberley, The Bungalow (Rudd House) and Dunluce, while he was instrumental in developing the Magersfontein Battlefield Museum and Pioneers of Aviation Museum on the outskirts of Kimberley. The most significant project of this period was undoubtedly the moving of the museum's headquarters from Chapel Street in Kimberley (where the original 1907 building and an annexe added in the 1950s were hemmed in by buildings in the city's commercial centre, constraining opportunities for expansion) to the Sanatorium, a rambling building in Belgravia, adjacent to the Duggan-Cronin Gallery, where there was much space for future additions of offices and laboratories for a constantly augmented staff and, crucially, of store-rooms for the museums growing collections.
The move from Chapel Street took place gradually through 1973 and 1974, with the Sanatorium being officially opened as the McGregor Museum's headquarters on 22 November 1976.
Liversidge's interest in history also ensured that what had been primarily a natural history museum came to be recognised, as significantly, for its humanities collections (with important holdings particularly of historical papers, photographs and textiles).
Publications
Liversidge published more than 80 scientific papers and 40 articles in a variety of journals on botany, ecology, ornithology, mammals, and history. A major contribution was as co-author, with Geoff McLachlan, of the first (1957) and subsequent three revisions of the Birds of South Africa, originally published by Austin Roberts in 1940.
Later, he wrote A Rapid Bird Guide (1978) and The Birds Around Us (1990), using the fine watercolour paintings of birds by Kimberley artist Jill Adams. The latter comprises almost a thousand accurately detailed and realistically coloured paintings of sitting, standing, swimming and flying birds. The main section of the book is divided into 15 habitats.
He was a co-author of several other books on history and game management.
Liversidge's pipits and springbok research
A major achievement in Richard Liversidge's ornithological career was the identification and description of two new species of pipit, the long-tailed pipit (Anthus longicaudatus) and, together with Gary Voelker, the Kimberley pipit (Anthus pseudosimilis).
He also carried out long-term work on the ecology of the springbok, and had the remarkable ability to predict rain, almost to the day, based on his observation of springbok behaviour.
Other interests and involvements
A member of several historical and game farmers' societies and associations, his interests covered a wide range of subjects.
Liversidge was a founder member and moving spirit behind the establishment of the Historical Society of Kimberley and the Northern Cape (which he would characteristically refer to as the Hysterical Society), serving as chairman over many years. Several of the society's publications were brought out at his instigation.
Passionate about old buildings, Liversidge served on the National Monuments Council for 14 years from 1977 and was a recipient of the Cape Times Centenary Medal (1990) for outstanding achievements in the conservation of historical buildings.
He served also on the councils of the Zoological Society of South Africa and the Wild Life Management Association. He had also been the last surviving founding member of the Cape Bird Club, the Western Cape branch of BirdLife South Africa.
Recognition of his contribution to natural history included his being made a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1994. He was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1974 and an Honorary Fellow in 1991. He was made a Fellow of the South African Museums Association in 1996. Other awards were for Game Conservation in Cape Province (1976), a Merit Award from the Northern Cape Game Ranchers' Association (1990), a Lifetime Achiever Award from the Kimberley Publicity Association (2002) and an Annual Scroll and (posthumous) Gold Medal from the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (2002).
Liversidge was a long-time and valued member of the Rotary Club of Kimberley (part of the worldwide service organisation Rotary International), serving as its president in 1976/77. Through Rotary he made significant contributions to the Kimberley, South African and International communities and was famed in the club as an impromptu speaker of note. In 1991 he was made a Paul Harris Fellow in recognition of his services to Rotary and to the community.
Memorials and commemorations
A special memorial issue of Ostrich: the Journal of African Ornithology (Volume 75 No 4) was published in December 2004 in honour and memory of Dr Liversidge. It was edited by Mark Anderson and included a dedication by N.F. Oppenheimer of De Beers.
An inscribed stone is the centre-piece of the Richard Liversidge Memorial Garden at the McGregor Museum.
The Kimberley Historical Society inaugurated an annual Richard Liversidge Memorial Lecture, which is presented at the society's Annual General Meeting.

The Chevron B24 was a Formula 5000 racing car developed by Chevron Cars in 1972.
The B24 was Chevron's first Formula 5000 racing car and thus the British racing car manufacturer's entry into the construction of large single-seaters. So far, Chevron had limited itself to vehicles in the smaller formula classes. In Chevron's nomenclature, the B24 succeeded the Chevron B23, a 2-liter displacement sports car developed in the early 1970s. Chevron built eight examples, all of which were fitted with a Chevrolet V8 engine. The B24 was a successful racing car that won numerous races. The car type is also notable in that it marks the only success of a Formula 5000 car over Formula 1 cars. In 1973, Peter Gethin won the Race of Champions in Brands Hatch with a work B24 for Formula 5000 and Formula 1 racing cars. Gethin also won the 1974 Tasman Championship in a B24.

The Stavich Bike Trail is a National Recreation Trail located in Mahoning County, Ohio and Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. The rail trail is 9.9 miles long and goes from Lowellville to Union Township in Lawrence County, traveling directly through Lowellville. It was constructed on the former Penn-Ohio Electric System trolley line along the Mahoning River in 1983, adjacent to the CSX New Castle Subdivision tracks. Considered an early example of rail-trails, its 1983 construction was dependent on a donation from the Stavich family, who ran many aluminum mills in the Youngstown area.
History
From the late 19th century through the 1940s, it was very common to find streetcars and trolleys throughout much of Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio. Originally, many of these streetcar lines were built by numerous companies, but merged into the Mahoning & Shenango Railway and Light System in 1905. The company changed its name to the Penn-Ohio Electric System in 1920. The company provided service through much of the area known as the Mahoning Valley, having both local streetcar lines and interurban trolleys. The main line, between New Castle and Youngstown, opened in 1902. Part of that line is now the Stavich Bike Trail.
The Penn-Ohio trolley system began its downfall once the rise of the automobile began, as well as the Great Depression. Ridership reportedly fell by 45% between 1930 and 1931. This caused the main line to be converted to buses between 1931 and 1932, the first in the Penn-Ohio system to do so. Subsequently, numerous other interurban trolleys and local streetcars in the Mahoning Valley were converted to buses. The last of which to be converted were the local streetcars in New Castle, which were converted to buses in 1941, forming the Shenango Valley Transportation Company.
Bicycle trail
In 1983, thanks to a donation from the Stavich family, who were a local aluminum tycoon, construction commenced on the nearly 10-mile long trail between the two cities. It opened later that year. Since then, numerous emergency repairs have had to be completed on the trail after intense Spring storms wash parts of the trail away.
Additionally, the Lawrence County Department of Planning & Community Development has proposed new trails connecting to Stavich Bike Trail in its 2017 Greenways Plan. One of which includes improving the trail connection from the Stavich Bike Trail to Downtown New Castle. The department's ideal option is to create a separate trail option into the city along Penn Power's right-of-way. It also plans for improvements at the crossing at Covert Road, which was identified as the most dangerous along the trail. Another proposed route continues the trail along the CSX railroad tracks info Mahoningtown, although this is a lower priority to the downtown connection.

Henri Jean Charles Eugène Denis (10 September 1877 – 19 January 1957) was a lieutenant general in the Belgian Army who served as Minister of National Defence at the beginning of the Second World War.
Career
Denis was born in Marbais on 10 September 1877. He enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in 1895 and in 1905 became second lieutenant in an artillery regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1906, adjutant to the General Staff in 1907, junior captain in 1912, full captain in May 1914. On 1 August 1914 he was assigned to the staff of the 18th Mixed Brigade. On 22 October 1914 he was removed from active duty after an accident and attached to the Ministry of War in the Belgian government in exile at Le Havre. In May 1915, at his own request, he returned to active duty on the Yser Front. In February 1917 he was appointed commissioner of the military railways, becoming a logistics specialist, and he was promoted to major on 26 September the same year. From 1920 he served on the logistics division of the General Staff. He became a lieutenant colonel in 1922, full colonel in 1927, major general in 1931 and lieutenant general in 1934.
Denis was appointed Minister of National Defence in the government that took office under Paul-Emile Janson on 23 November 1937, and retained the position in the administrations headed by Paul-Henri Spaak and Hubert Pierlot in the run-up to the Second World War. He was among the four members of the government who met with King Leopold III at Wijnendale Castle on 25 May 1940 and failed to convince the monarch to follow the government into exile in France. He himself, aged 68, resigned from the Belgian government in exile when it relocated to London in October 1940, opting to remain in retirement in Vichy France. In 1943 he moved to Switzerland. He died in Saint-Gilles (Brussels) on 19 January 1957.

Lara Cornelius (adopted, née Ryan) is a fictional character from the German soap opera Verbotene Liebe, first portrayed by Karoline Schuch from September 18, 2000 to May 23, 2002. 12 years later the character was recast with Clara Gerst, who made her first on-screen appearance on October 2, 2014.
Storylines
Lara arrived in Düsseldorf in order to visit her alleged aunt, Elisabeth Ryan, during her mother Irene's health problems. Thinking she'll be living only temporarily with Elisabeth and her partner, Arno Brandner, Lara befriended Alexa Seifert and developed unexpected feelings for the ambitious singer Christian Toppe. Shortly afterwards, Irene died and Lara was forced to stary with Elisabeth and Arno, which raised new problems for the Brandner family, as Lara was unable to accept her mother's death. However, she didn't know that Irene wasn't her mother due to a secret kept from her for her entire life. Lara warmed up to her cousin Nina Ryan, not even suspecting Nina's true role in her life. As time goes by, Lara figured out Elisabeth's secret, who pretended to be her mother in order to protect Nina. Lara managed to accept the situation and allowed Nina to form a bond as sisters, but later, Elisabeth was forced to reveal to Nina the truth: Nina was Lara's mother, having given birth to her at the age of thirteen and having developed amnesia as the birth's result. As Lara was confronted with the truth, she was unable to forgive Nina or Elisabeth at first, but when Nina decided to leave Germany for Greece, Lara forgave them both and shared an emotional farewell with Nina.
After Nina's exit, Lara and Christian entered into a relationship which was stressed under the circumstances of Christian's singing career, as his manager forced him to pretend to be single in publicity. Lara was deeply hurt, but gave Christian another chance - only to find him in bed with a groupie. Lara couldn't forgive Christian and ended their relationship. After Christian left town, Lara concentrated on school and her friendships with Alexa and Franziska von Beyenbach. Alexa's new roommate Andi Fritzsche fell in love with Lara despite their previous aversion and even kissed her during a storm, but then decided to seek comfort with Franziska, after Lara rejected his advances. Later, Nina returned and confronted Lara with her offer to start a new life in Greece. Lara was hesitant at first, not wanting to give up her friendships in Düsseldorf, but then accepted Nina's offer and left town for Greece in May 2002.
In 2014, Lara returned to Düsseldorf to visit her grandmother Elisabeth, who meanwhile lived at Castle Königsbrunn, being the widow of Ludwig von Lahnstein. Seeking to complete her law studies, Lara stayed in Düsseldorf and settled in the WG, befriending Emilio Sanchez and reconnecting with Andi. As Emilio's wife Kim Wolf suspected Emilio of attempted murder of Per Mertens, Lara tried to prove Emilio's innocence and finally succeeded. Kim and Emilio's marriage resulted in a divorce, though, and Lara caught herself hoping for a relationship with Emilio. However, Lara realized Emilio would never love any woman but Kim and decided to return to Greece in January 2015.

Spätzla, Spätzle [ˈʃpɛtslə] or Spatzen are Swabian or Alemannic pasta of an elongated shape which is served as a side dish or with other ingredients as a main dish. Similar pasta of a rotund shape is called Knöpfle in Baden-Württemberg and in Bavarian Swabia.
Spätzle are egg-based pasta made with fresh egg of an irregular form with a rough, porous surface. The glutinous dough is put directly into boiling water or steam and the form varies between thin and thick, elongated and short. They are the only pasta that is cooked for the first time during the fabrication. The moist dough is either pressed through a perforated metal plate or it drips through this plate into the boiling water. Other ways to prepare Spätzle are more applicable for domestic use.
Name
Spätzle is the Swabian diminutive of Spatz and possibly means “sparrow” or “clump”. Spätzle used in this context stands in plural form. In the 18th century this dish was referred to as "Wasserspatzen" (engl. water sparrows). In Switzerland and in Markgräflerland (Margraves' Land) the dish is called "Spätzli" or "Chnöpfli" and in the Low Alemannic area "Knepfli". There is an equivalent and common dish in Hungary ("nokedli" and also "galuska" – whereas both terms are naturalised loanwords) and Slovakia ("galuska" or "halušky") with Austria connecting both cultures. In Northern Austria, Spätzle are called "Nockerln" (as in the dish Eiernockerl) whereas dumplings are also referred to as "Nocken" in Carinthia and Tyrol.
The name probably refers to the form of the Spätzle in the 18th century, which was compared to the shape of the sparrow. Some linguists derive it from the word “clump”, meaning dough which tends to form clots.
Depending on the form, some regions differentiate between Spätzle (the length exceeds the diameter around more than the fourfold) and Knöpfle (the relation of length to diameter is under two). Spätzle which went wrong, which are very lumpy or stick together are also called “raven”, “little stork”, “black horse”, “nightingale”, “grandfather” or “eagle”.
History and meaning
The history of Spätzle and Knöpfle in Swabia goes back centuries and is very important to Swabian cuisine.
In Swabian literature, there is a multitude of poems about “the favourite dish of the Swabian people”. Examples are poems such as “Das Lob der Schwabenknöpfle” (The Praise of Swabian Knöpfle) which was published in the regional newspaper Schwarzwälder Bote (Black Forest Messenger) in 1838, the poem “Schwäbische Leibspeisa” (The Swabian Favourite Dish) or the “Spätzles-Lied” (The Spätzle Song).
The manufacturing of Spätzle in Swabia can be traced back to the 18th century.
In 1725 the Württembergian council and private physician Lentilius defined “Knöpflein” and “Spatzen” as “everything that is made from flour”. Back then, spelt was widely used in Swabia and Alemannia.
Since the region was marked by rural peasant structures and poverty, the undemanding grain spelt was very popular since it also thrives in low-nutrient soil.
Spelt is high in gluten, so in times of scarcity it could be made into a dough without the addition of eggs. Consequently, it is the flour most commonly used in the preparation of Spätzle.
Traditionally, Spätzle are scraped manually on a board, which is still considered a special certification mark. For efficiency reasons, a mechanical production of “homemade” Spätzle comparable with manually scraped ones emerged at the start of the 20th century. With the beginning of industrialisation and progressing prosperity, Spätzle advanced from everyday food to a delicacy eaten during the holidays. People from a Swabian farming village called it a festive dish in 1937. One year prior, regional poet Sebastian Blau (Josef Eberle's pseudonym) rendered Spätzle a symbol of Swabian identity: “… Spätzle are the foundation of our cuisine, the glory of our country, … the be-all and end-all of the Swabian menu…”.
Nowadays, Swabian Spätzle or Knöpfle can be found in nearly every product ranges of Swabian pasta producers and since the 1980s, they also have been successfully exported. They are mentioned in many Swabian traditions and celebrations and also form part of tourist activities in terms of culinary specialty weeks or courses, seminars and competitions where Spätzle are scraped (made). There are many cooking competitions and various world records in “Spätzleschaben” (Spätzle scraping). A number of exhibitions document the traditional knowledge of the making of Spätzle in the Swabian region from the very beginnings until today. The great importance of Spätzle for the Swabian kitchen is proofed by the novel “Die Geschichte von den sieben Schwaben” (The history of the seven Swabians), published in 1827, according to which in Swabia exists the tradition “of eating five times a day, which means five times soup, and two times the soup is accompanied by Knöpfle or Spätzle”.
In 1892, Elise Henle explained that a Swabian woman should be able to manufacture Spätzle: “s isch koi richtigs Schwobe-Mädla, des net Spätzla kocha ka” (“t'is not a real Swabian girl, who isn't able to cook Spätzle”). For the modern era the Swabian author Siegfried Ruoß lists more than 50 different Spätzle recipes in his cookbook “Schwäbische Spätzleküche”. In Bad Waldsee, in upper-Swabia, there is a Spätzle museum since 2013.
The earliest recipes for Spätzle can be found in the so-called “Göppinger Kochbuch”, which was composed by Rosina Dorothea Knör (1733-1809) in 1783.
Pastry ingredients and preparation of Spätzle
Ingredients
The Spätzle dough is made from flour, eggs, lukewarm water, in some places also with milk, and salt. The measurements, however, can vary. Spätzle flour which is sold in retail is often coarse wheat flour type 405 (German standard), in some cases mixed with spelt flour or fine semolina since it prevents the dough from going lumpy.
Preparation
In contrast to a kneaded pasta dough, Spätzle dough is stirred and therefore softer and moister. For the further preparation, there are several different ways:
Scraped: Traditionally, the fresh dough is placed on a moist, ideally tilted board. From there it is scraped in thin stripes into the boiling salt water. This traditional way is elaborate and requires practice.
Pressed: With a Spätzle press, the dough is pressed vertically into the water forming long and even Spätzle.
Shredded: There are different kinds of Spätzlehobel (planes) producing either thick and short Spätzle (Knöpfle) or long Spätzle.
A new way of making Spätzle are Spätzle sieves.
After the Spätzle are cooked, they swim to the top and can be removed with a skimmer. They shouldn't be rinsed with water but served hot instead.
There are also premade Spätzle which come in either dry or frozen form and can be boiled directly in hot water.
Spätzle dishes
Apple Spätzle: a sweet variant, which can be found in the Allgäu and in the region of the Lake Constance. Steamed slices of apple or rather stewed apple are added to roasted Spätzle which is then sprinkled with sugar or cinnamon.

Hazelnut Spätzle: roasted and with ground hazelnuts.
Potato Spätzle: grated, cooked potatoes are added to the Spätzle dough.
Cheese Spätzle: probably the most famous Spätzle dish. It has a particular tradition in Swabia, in the Allgäu and in Vorarlberg, where it is known as “Käsknöpfle”. Many of these variants have something in common: Spätzle, onions and different types of cheese are layered. Typical types of cheese are Emmental and mountain cheese, but also Limburger cheese, beer cheese or Vorarlberg mountain cheese. Supplements are usually green salads or potato salad. In the uplands of Vorarlberg or in Liechtenstein, it is common to add applesauce. Rests of Cheese Spätzle can be fried in a pan with butter.

Megalomyrmex incisus is a Neotropical species of ants in the subfamily Myrmicinae. The species is known from southern Mexico south to central Brazil and Peru.
Habitat and distribution
M. incisus occurs in moist to wet forest habitats, from sea level to 1000 m elevation. It is most often encountered as workers in Winkler samples of sifted leaf litter. Colonies have twice been collected from dead wood on the forest floor.
Description
Material from Central America and Venezuela is very similar in color and mandibular dentition. Workers are solid black, and the basal teeth of the mandible vary in size, the second from the base being much larger than the flanking teeth. As a result the mandible appears falcate rather than triangular. A collection from Colombia is distinctive, with the color lighter red brown and the basal teeth of the mandible of more uniform size. Other size and shape characters, including the highly distinctive petiole, are the same as other M. incisus. M. incisus has a range disjunction. It is moderately abundant in Winkler samples from Guatemala and southern Mexico, occurs in Panama and Venezuela, yet has never been collected in Costa Rica, in spite of extensive survey work there.

Lex animata (the law animate) is a Latin term for the law being embodied in a living entity, usually the sovereign by the grace of God. In that sense a king could be lex animata, a living, breathing law. The equivalent Greek term, used in the Byzantine Empire, is .
Originating in Hellenistic philosophy, the identification of the Roman sovereign as nomos empsychos was established in law by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in his Novellae Constitutiones, and imported from there into Western civil law by the medieval glossators. Over time, the label was extended from the emperor to the various European kings. In some formulations, the argument went both ways: the king was law, but he could not do but as the law instructed.
History
The concept of nomos empsychos is typically considered to have originated in a Hellenistic theory of kingship, which developed after Alexander the Great in the 3rd–2nd centuries BC and drew on the Platonic idea of the philosopher acting as founding lawgiver to the polis. Aristotle, in his Nicomachean Ethics (mid-4th century BC), already describes the ideal judge as "living justice" ().
The first surviving use of the form nomos empsychos, however, is found in a pseudo-Pythagorean work, attributed to Archytas but probably dated after 50 BC. The Constantinopolitan orator Themistius used the label to describe Emperor Constantius II in 350 AD, and the concept had gained wide currency by late antiquity. The notion of the emperor as nomos empsychos—later translated into Latin as lex animata—was established officially in the 6th century Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian I, which would come to serve as one of the foundations of later civil law in the West. Justinian's formulation, compiled by Tribonian, runs:
In the Middle Ages, the glossators of the 12th and 13th centuries, notably Accursius, applied the concept of lex animata to the Holy Roman emperor. Accursius rendered the principle in the Code of Justinian as ("the prince is the law animate on earth"), and argued that all holders of ordinary jurisdiction over particular geographical areas derived their right from the emperor as living law.
The term was also used of the pope by hierocratic writers, and it was ultimately extended to individual kings, as the French jurist Barthélemy de Chasseneuz did in the case of the king of France in his 1529 Catalogus gloriae mundi. The 14th century Italian jurist Baldus de Ubaldis wrote, "" ("The king is the law animate ... I sleep and my heart, that is, my king, keeps watch"), and in his 1598 The True Law of Free Monarchies, James VI of Scotland also referred to the concept when he affirmed "the old definition ... which makes the King to be a speaking law and the law a dumb King".
The concept of the king as lex animata faced resistance in medieval English law, however. When Parliament ratified the deposition of Richard II in 1399, it listed as one reason the fact that Richard had believed "that the laws were in his own mouth". Despite paralleling Byzantine political ideas in other respects, Islamic philosophy also departed from the notion of nomos empsychos by conceiving the caliphs as administering the sharia established by Muhammad rather than as lawgivers in their own right. The idea of the lex animata was later deconstructed more systematically by Montesquieu and other constitutional thinkers of the Enlightenment, with Montesquieu pronouncing that : "the judge", not the king, "is the law speaking", and the judge is not animate, but "inanimate", deriving rather than inventing the law.
Modern usage
The idea of lex animata is sometimes used in modern political debate, usually to scorn an opponent for being too self-important or delusional about his insights into the law and constitutional affairs. In judicial circles it is sometimes used in jest, recognising a peer as an authority on the law in general.

Lee Yuan-Chen (Chinese: 李元貞 ; born 1946) is an active feminist and one of the leading figures in Taiwan's feminist movements.
Early life
Born in Kunming, the largest city of Yunnan province in the People's Republic of China, Lee Yuan-Chen came to Taiwan with her parents at the age of three. Lee Yuan-Chen received both her bachelor's and master's degrees from the National Taiwan University, Department of Chinese literature, respectively in 1968 and in 1971. Inspired by Annette Lu, the pioneer of Taiwan's feminist movement, and triggered by a myriad of societal issues in Taiwan, Lee Yuan-Chen together with other Taiwanese feminists founded the Awakening magazine in 1982, during a historical period in which Taiwan was still under the martial law. As one of the founders and the leader of the Awakening magazine, Lee Yuan-Chen decided to transform it into the Awakening Foundation in 1987, which helped usher in a new era for feminist movements in Taiwan. Currently, Lee Yuan-Chen is an emeritus professor at Tamkang University, Department of Chinese literature.
Married life
Lee Yuan-Chen married her husband during the time she taught at Tamkang University. Initially, Lee Yuan-Chen and her husband had reached a consensus that they would function as a modern couple with the implication of having an egalitarian relationship. However, that consensus was eroded after the birth of their first daughter, as Lee Yuan-Chen's husband demanded her to live with his parents. Lee Yuan-Chen felt forced into a lifestyle that was contradictory to her beliefs and divorced her husband in 1973. Due to the law of the Republic of China at that period of time, custody of her child was granted to the husband. Lee Yuan-Chen was deeply frustrated with this result.
The Awakening Period
Discontent with the patriarchal structure embedded in Taiwan's democratic movement around 1970s, motivated by Annette Lu, and provoked by her own marriage experience, Lee Yuan-Chen was determined to awaken female consciousness in Taiwan. Partnering up with other Taiwanese feminists, Lee Yuan-Chen led the effort of founding the very first magazine concentrating on highlighting female issues in Taiwan, the Awakening Magazine. As the leader of the Awakening group, Lee Yuan-Chen and other like-minded members not only focused on the publication, but also devoted themselves to initiating a series of public activities for the purpose of raising Taiwanese society's awareness on feminist issues. Amid the financial challenges that loomed over the Awakening magazine around 1980s, Lee Yuan-Chen, along with other members of the Awakening group, made the decision of transforming the Awakening magazine into a nonprofit organization that would be more adept at attracting founding and therefore permit the group to continue pushing forward feminist movements in Taiwan. In the year of 1987, the Awakening Foundation was established.
Feminist Movement vis-à-vis Mass Media in Taiwan
Lee Yuan-Chen is convinced that holding mass demonstrations on the streets cannot sufficiently gain more attention for feminist movements in Taiwan's mass media. She contends that feminist organizations in Taiwan must expand both in terms of the number of branches and memberships, especially at the grassroots level, in order to increase the awareness of Taiwan's mass media of the importance of feminist issues.
Critique of Lee Yuan-Chen
The Awakening Foundation was criticized for being incapable of communicating with women at the grassroots level, due to the fact that most of the members of the Awakening group, including Lee Yuan-Chen herself, were from middle or upper-middle classes.
Lee Yuan-Chen's Critique of Tsai Ing-Wen's Administration
In 2016, Taiwan elected its very first female president, Tsai Ing-Wen. However, it did not lead to the increase of female cabinet members in the Tsai administration. Instead, there were only 4 female politicians in a cabinet consisted of 40 members. As a result, Lee Yuan-Chen declined an invitation sent by President Tsai to the state banquet in 2016 to protest the gender inequality in President Tsai's cabinet.

SIP trunking is a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology commonly referred to as 'elephant trunking' and a streaming media service based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) by which Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs) deliver telephone services and unified communications to customers equipped with SIP-based private branch exchange (IP-PBX) and unified communications facilities. Most unified communications applications provide voice, video, and other streaming media applications such as desktop sharing, web conferencing, and shared whiteboard.
Domains
The architecture of SIP trunking provides a partitioning of the unified communications network into two different domains of expertise:
Private domain: refers to a part of the network connected to a PBX or unified communications server.
Public domain: refers to the part of the network which allows access into the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or public land mobile network (PLMN).
The interconnection between the two domains must occur through a SIP trunk. The interconnection between the two domains, created by transport via the Internet Protocol (IP), involves setting specific rules and regulations as well as the ability to handle some services and protocols that fall under the name of SIP trunking.
The ITSP is responsible to the applicable regulatory authority regarding all the following law obligations of the public domain:
Tracking traffic;
Identification of users;
Implementation of the lawful interception mechanisms.
The private domain instead, by nature, is not subject to particular constraints of law, and may be either the responsibility of the ITSP, the end user (enterprise), or of a third party who provides the voice services to the company
Architecture
Each domain has elements that perform the characteristic features requested of that domain, in particular the result (as part of any front-end network to the customer) is logically divided into two levels:
The control of access (Class 5 softswitch);
Network-border elements that separate the Public Domain from the Private Domain, implementing all the appropriate ITSP phone security policies.
The private domain consists of three levels:
corporate-border elements that separate the public domain from the private domain, implementing the appropriate company security policies
central corporate switching node
IP PBXs

Parli Pro is a shortened name for the National FFA Organization Parliamentary Procedure Career Development Event.
The FFA Parliamentary Procedure Contest is based on a two-part demonstration of parliamentary procedure knowledge, a knowledge test, and an 8 to 10 minute, depending on the state, demonstration of parliamentary law. Six students form a team who demonstrates a local FFA Chapter meeting. A single motion is handled as in a real meeting. Each team member is given a specific topic or motion in which he and she is to perform (i.e. to refer a matter to a committee, postpone definitely, extend limits or debate, appeal, etc.). Contestants are judged on public speaking skills, debate, proper use of parliamentary procedure, and parliamentary procedure knowledge. The president, or chairman, is judged on the ability to preside, etc.
The contest, like other FFA Career Development Events, are held at the sectional, regional, state, and national levels. Most parli pro contests are based on an elimination system, in which teams perform in rounds, where the best 4 - 6 teams are moved on to the next round. At the state and national levels, the top teams can be separated by mere points (out of 1000 total contest points).
The Oregon Association utilizes a different organization of their Parli Pro CDE. It lacks a written test and question-and-answer period that is present at the National level. All of the teams compete at the same time, with three teams on the floor at a time and one team chairing each "session" of the contest. Additional teams are rotated in after each session. It is run as a mock version of the first delegate session at the State Convention. Debate topics are drawn at random from a list of 20 topics that pertain to current agricultural issues and FFA-related issues. Points are given based on motions moved and the quality of a student's debate. The chairman's abilities are also scored, as are the Secretary's minutes that are taken during the session that the team is chairing.
Parli Pro is one of much Leadership Development Events (LDEs) held each year, including Extemporaneous Public Speaking, Prepared Public Speaking, Creed Contest, Sectional Opening, and Closing, and Job Interview.
National Winners
Each State Association names a State Winner and that team is therefore eligible to compete in the National Contest.
Current Winners
As of October 29th, 2021 the current winners of the National FFA Parliamentary Procedure Leadership Development Event are:
First Place: Galt Liberty Ranch FFA (California)
Second Place: Imperial FFA (Nebraska)
Third Place: Felicity-Franklin FFA (Ohio)
Fourth Place: Troy FFA (Missouri)

'Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawazin Abū al-Qāsim al-Qushayrī al-Naysābūrī, (, ) (also Kushayri) was an Arab Muslim scholar and theologian known for his works on Sufism. He was born in 986 CE (376 AH) in Nishapur which is in Khorasan Province in Iran. This region was widely known as a center of Islamic civilization up to the 13th Century CE. He was the grandfather of the scholar Abd al-Ghafir al-Farsi, a contemporary of Al Ghazali.
Biography
Al Qushayri was born into a privileged Arab family from among the Banu Qushayr who had settled near Nishapur. As a young man he received the education of a country squire of the time: adab, the Arabic language, chivalry and weaponry (istiʿmāl al-silāḥ), but that all changed when he journeyed to the city of Nishapur and was introduced to the Sufi shaykh Abū ʿAlī al-Daqqāq. Daqqāq later became the master and teacher of the mystical ways to Qushayri. He later married the daughter of Daqqāq, Fatima. After the death of Daqqāq, Qushayri became the successor of his master and father-in-law and became the leader of mystic assemblies in the madrasa that Abu Ali al-Daqqāq built in 1001 CE, which later became known as al-Madrasa al-Qushayriyya or "the school of the Qushayri family". In later years Qushayri performed the pilgrimage in the company of Abū Muḥammad al-Juwaynī (d. 438/1047), the father of Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni, as well as traveling to Baghdad and the Hijaz. During these travels he heard Hadith from various prominent Hadith scholars. Upon his return he began teaching Hadith, which is something he is famous for. He returned to Baghdad where the Caliph al-Qa'im had him perform hadith teachings in his palace. After his return to Khurāsān, political unrest in the region between the Ḥanafī and Ashʿarī-Shāfiʿī factions in the city forced him to leave Nishapur, but he was eventually able to return and lived there until his death in 1072/465, when the Seljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk re-established the balance of power between the Ḥanafīs and the Shāfiʿīs. He left behind six sons and several daughters between Fatima and his second wife and was buried near al-Madrasa al-Qushayriyya, next to his father in-law Abū ʿAlī al-Daqqāq
Work
Laṭā'if al-Isharat bi-Tafsīr al-Qur'ān is a famous work of al-Qushayri that is a complete commentary of the Qur'an. He determined that there were four levels of meaning in the Qur'an. First, the Ibara which is the meaning of the text meant for the mass of believers. Second, the ishara, only available to the spiritual elite and lying beyond the obvious verbal meaning. Third, laṭā'if, subtleties in the text that were meant particularly for saints. And finally, the ḥaqā'iq, which he said were only comprehensible to the prophets. This text placed him among the elite of the Sufi mystics and is widely used as a standard of Sufi thought.
His fame however, is due mostly to his Al-Risala al-Qushayriyya, or Al-Qushayrī's Epistle on Sufism. This text is essentially a reminder to the people of his era that Sufis had authentic ancestral tradition, as well as a defence of Sufism against the doubters that rose during that time of his life. Al-Qushayri repeatedly acknowledges his debt to, and admiration for, his
Sufi master throughout his Risala. Daqqaq was instrumental in introducing Qushayri to another outstanding Sufi authority of Khurasan, Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami (412/1021), who is quoted on almost every page of the Risala. It has sections where al-Qushayrī discusses the creed of the Sufis, mentions important and influential Sufis from the past, and establishes fundamentals of Sufi terminology, giving his own interpretation of those Sufi terms. Al-Qushayrī finally goes through specific practices of Sufism and the techniques of those practices. This text has been used by many Sufi saints in later times as a standard, as is obvious from the many translations into numerous languages.

The men's +100 kg competition in judo at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was held on 12 August at the Carioca Arena 2.
The gold and silver medals were determined by a single-elimination tournament, with the winner of the final taking gold and the loser receiving silver. Judo events awarded two bronze medals. Quarterfinal losers competed in a repechage match for the right to face a semifinal loser for a bronze medal (that is, the judokas defeated in quarterfinals A and B competed against each other, with the winner of that match facing the semifinal loser from the other half of the bracket).
The medals for the competition were presented by Rene Fasel, Switzerland, member of the International Olympic Committee and the gifts were presented by Jean-Luc Rouge, International Judo Federation secretary-general.
At the competition, in the first round Egyptian judoka Islam El Shahaby refused to shake the hand of Israeli judoka Or Sasson, the eventual bronze medalist, who had defeated El Shahaby. In August 2016 the Disciplinary Committee of the International Olympic Committee issued a "severe reprimand" to El Shehaby for behavior violating "the rules of fair play and against the spirit of friendship embodied in the Olympic Values", and requested that the Egyptian Olympic Committee in the future make certain that all Egyptian athletes are properly educated as to the Olympic Values before they participate in the Olympic Games.

County Buildings is a municipal structure in King Erik Street, Lerwick, Shetland, Scotland. The structure, which is used as a judicial complex, is a Category B listed building.
History
The first judicial facility in Lerwick was a medieval tolbooth in Commercial Street which was completed in the 17th century. After becoming dilapidated, it was demolished and replaced by a new tolbooth, which was built by the local masons, Robert and James Forbes, and completed in around 1770. The new tolbooth was used as a prison as well as a sheriff courthouse: however, in 1836, the prison inspector reported on the poor conditions in which prisoners were held and, by the mid-19th century, the justices were also seeking better facilities.
A site for the new building was identified in King Erik Street: it was designed by David Rhind in the Scottish baronial style, built by D. Outerson in ashlar stone, and completed in 1875. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with four bays facing onto King Erik Street with the central two bays slightly projected forward; the second bay on the left featured a doorway with a hood mould containing a date stone. On the ground floor, the first and third bays had two-light sash windows while the fourth bay had a single-light sash window. On the first floor, the bays, which were all surmounted by stepped gables, featured single-light sash windows. Internally, the main south-facing block contained office accommodation for the sheriff clerk, while additional blocks behind contained the sheriff court, a prison and the local police station.
The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 established a uniform system of county councils in Scotland. Zetland County Council, which was created in 1890, established its headquarters in the complex which subsequently became known as the County Buildings. A United States Congressional delegation visited County Buildings to inquire into the impact of North Sea oil on local development in July 1974. The complex reverted to being used largely for judicial purposes, accommodating the offices of the procurator fiscal, as well as the courthouse and the police station, after Zetland County Council was abolished in 1975.
The building featured extensively in the television series Shetland, which was first broadcast in March 2013, as the place of work of the main character, Detective Inspector Jimmy Pérez.
The local registrar's office moved from County Buildings to Lerwick Town Hall in February 2015.

Below is the list of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2019.
Timeline of known close approaches less than one lunar distance from Earth
A list of known near-Earth asteroid close approaches less than 1 lunar distance () from Earth in 2019. 2019 has been a notable year in that an asteroid was detected prior to impact (2019 MO). This has only happened three times previously (see List of successfully predicted asteroid impacts). In addition, for the first year ever, four close approaches of previously undiscovered asteroids were successfully predicted over a week in advance.
For reference, the radius of Earth is approximately or 0.0166 lunar distances.Geosynchronous satellites have an orbit with semi-major axis length of or 0.110 lunar distances. A number of known asteroids came closer than this in 2019, notably including 2019 MO which was detected a few hours before it impacted, only the fourth asteroid impact in history to have been successfully predicted in advance. While most asteroids on this list are confirmed, well-observed unconfirmed objects with a 50% or greater chance of passing within 1 LD of the Earth are included as well.
Warning Times by Size
This sub-section visualises the warning times of the close approaches listed in the above table, depending on the size of the asteroid. The sizes of the charts show the relative sizes of the asteroids to scale. For comparison, the approximate size of a person is also shown. This is based the absolute magnitude of each asteroid, an approximate measure of size based on brightness.
Abs Magnitude 30 and greater
(size of a person for comparison)
Abs Magnitude 29-30
Absolute Magnitude 28-29
Absolute Magnitude 27-28
Absolute Magnitude 26-27
Absolute Magnitude 25-26
Absolute Magnitude less than 25 (largest)
Notes
Timeline of close approaches less than one lunar distance from the Moon
The number of asteroids listed here are significantly less than those of asteroids that approach Earth for several reasons. Asteroids that approach Earth not only move faster, but are brighter and are easier to detect with modern surveys because:
Asteroids that come closer to Earth are a higher priority to confirm, and only confirmed asteroids are listed with a lunocentric approach distance.
Those that closely approach the Moon are frequently lost in its glare, making them harder to confirm. They are similarly hard to discover during the new moon, when the Moon is too close to the Sun to detect asteroids while they are near the Moon.
These factors severely limit the amount of Moon-approaching asteroids, to a level many times lower than the asteroids detected passing as close to Earth.
Notes
Additional examples
An example list of near-Earth asteroids that passed more than 1 lunar distance (384,400 km or 0.00256 AU) from Earth in 2019.
Notes
Virtual impactors
Listed are asteroids that are included on the Sentry Risk Table because they have short observation arcs with poorly constrained orbits and have a chance of striking Earth in 2019. Given a short observation arc, many different orbits fit the observed data. These objects could be millions if not billions of kilometers from Earth on the date of a low probability virtual impactor. For example, is expected to be from Earth in October 2019 around the time of the virtual impact.
Cumulatively among the asteroids listed below, there is a roughly 1 in 16,500 chance that any of the asteroids will impact Earth in 2019. Most of this comes from asteroid which formerly had a 1 in 20,000 chance of impact on 9 September 2019, but the impact was ruled out in August.
Also included are asteroids discovered before impact and exceptionally massive fireballs with either an equivalent yield of more than 1 kiloton of TNT or an estimated size of more than 3 meters.

A no-fly zone, also known as a no-flight zone (NFZ), or air exclusion zone (AEZ), is a territory or area established by a military power over which certain aircraft are not permitted to fly. Such zones are usually set up in an enemy power's territory during a conflict, similar in concept to an aerial demilitarized zone, and usually intend to prohibit the enemy's military aircraft from operating in the region. Military action is employed by the enforcing state and, depending on the terms of the NFZ, may include preemptive attacks to prevent potential violations, reactive force targeted at violating aircraft, or surveillance with no use of force. Air exclusion zones and anti-aircraft defences are sometimes set up in a civilian context, for example to protect sensitive locations, or events such as the 2012 London Olympic Games, against terrorist air attack.
No-fly zones are a modern phenomenon established in the 1990s. They can be distinguished from traditional air power missions by their coercive appropriation of another nation's airspace only, to achieve aims on the ground within the target nation. While the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted prototypical air control operations over various contentious colonies between the two World Wars, no-fly zones did not assume their modern form until the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
During the Cold War, the risk of local conflict escalating into nuclear showdown made military intervention as a tool of United States statecraft unappealing. Furthermore, air power was a relatively blunt instrument until the operational maturation of stealth and precision-strike technologies. Before the Gulf War of 1991, it had not been possible to perform nuanced attacks against transitory, difficult-to-reach targets, and air power thus lacked the ability to produce decisive political effects short of total war. However, the demise of the Soviet Union and technological advances in aerospace capabilities made no-fly zones viable in both political and military contexts.
Past no-fly zones
Iraq, 1991–2003
Following the 1991 Gulf War, the United States along with other Coalition nations established two no-fly zones in Iraq. U.S. and Coalition officials stated that the northern no-fly zone was intended to prevent attacks against the Kurdish people by the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, and that the southern no-fly-zone was intended to protect Iraq's Shia population. On 16 March 1988, the Iraqi Air Force deployed chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians during the Halabja chemical attack, killing roughly 5,000. This air-to-ground event served as part of the motivation used by Coalition Forces in order to extend and expand the NFZs, as well as citing parts of Article 42 within the U.N. Charter. The southern no-fly zone originally extended to the 32nd parallel, but was extended to the 33rd parallel in 1996. By 1999, over 1,800 bombs had reportedly been dropped on Iraq.
Legal status
This military action was not authorised by the United Nations. The Secretary-General of the United Nations at the time the resolution was passed, Boutros Boutros-Ghali called the no-fly zones "illegal" in a February 2003 interview with John Pilger for ZNet. In 1998, France withdrew from the operation, with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine saying that "there is no basis in international law for this type of bombing".
Civilian deaths
The United Nations reported that, in 1999 alone, 144 civilians had been killed during Coalition bombing efforts. An internal UN Security Sector report found that, in one five-month period, 41% of the victims were civilians.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1993–1995
In 1992, the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 781, prohibiting unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone but did not take action against violators of the resolution. In response to 500 documented violations by 1993, including one combat violation, the Security Council passed Resolution 816, which prohibited all unauthorized flights and allowed all UN member states to "take all necessary measures...to ensure compliance with [the no-fly zone restrictions]." This led to Operation Deny Flight, during which the Banja Luka incident, the shooting down of at least four of a flight of six Serbian jets, occurred; the engagemen was not only the first combat engagement of the operation, but also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO. NATO later launched air strikes during Operation Deny Flight and during Operation Deliberate Force. As many as 400 NATO aircraft participated in the air campaign.
Libya, 2011
As part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya, the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone on 17 March 2011. The resolution includes provisions for further actions to prevent attacks on civilian targets. On 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone. Shortly thereafter, several NATO members proceeded to mount an aerial offensive campaign, in which numerous Libyan government positions would be intentionally bombed. Some NATO members did not contribute or did little to participate in the air campaign, leading to public criticism from US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. The NATO no fly zone was terminated on 27 October after a unanimous vote by the UNSC, despite requests made by the Libyan National Transitional Council for its mission to be extended to the end of the year.
Libya, 2018 and 2019
A no-fly zone was declared by the Libyan National Army (LNA) over the country's south during the LNA's offensive in the region in 2018. It was later re-implemented for 10 days in 2019 as the LNA established control over oil fields in the region. The LNA declared another no-fly zone across the country's west during the 2019 Western Libya offensive.
Discussion of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, 2022
Shortly after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukrainian leadership repeatedly urged NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but the alliance rejected the request on account of risking further escalation and direct military confrontation with Russia. There were also questions over the effectiveness of implementing such a zone for the purpose of protecting the Ukrainian settlements, which have been subject to heavy and indiscriminate attacks from Russian artillery and other largely ground-based forces. On 18 March, the Russian-backed separatist government of the Donetsk People's Republic claimed that Russia would establish a no-fly zone over the Donbas region of Ukraine.
Analysis
A 2004 Stanford University paper published in Journal of Strategic Studies, "Lessons from Iraq and Bosnia on the Theory and Practice of No-fly Zones," reviewed the effectiveness of the air-based campaigns in achieving military objectives. The paper's findings were: 1) A clear, unified command structure is essential. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, during "Operation Deny Flight," a confusing dual-key coordination structure provided inadequate authority and resulted in air forces not being given authority to assist in key situations; 2) To avoid a "perpetual patrol problem," states must know in advance their policy objectives and the exit strategy for no-fly zones; 3) The effectiveness of no-fly zones is highly dependent on regional support. A lack of support from Turkey for the 1996 Iraq no-fly zone ultimately constrained the coalition's ability to effectively enforce it.

Peter Zirschky was the singer and songwriter for the Dutch hardcore punk band Funeral Oration. He was the only constant member of the band, being their frontman since the very beginning in 1982 until their break up circa 1999. He also played guitar on some of their early recordings. Zirschky, a long-time horror movie fan, was also the founder of Horror Relations and Savage Cinema fanzines and distro. He even named his cat Lucio – after the famous Italian film director Lucio Fulci. Peter Zirschky died by accident around 2004.
After listening to punk rock for a couple of years, Peter Zirschky decided to start a punk band. It was 1980 and they called themselves Art Protexion, probably because Zirschky's favourite band at the time was The Art Attacks. Drummer Ferry Fidom and bassplayer Mike de Veer joined him an year later in Last Warning. They soon changed their name to Funeral Oration, with no thought behind that, but broke up two months later.
In 1983, Zirschky placed an ad in the Dutch punk magazine Koekrand, saying: "Need a bassplayer, don't have to be good, but has to be pretty fast", recruiting William Steinhäuser to play the bass and forming the core of the revived Funeral Oration. The band went on to release numerous EPs, two cassette-only albums and 7 full-length LPs, the pinnacle of which was their debut album "Communion" (1985), and also toured the States three times during the 1990s.

Mary Agnes Yerkes, ( ; August 9, 1886 – November 8, 1989), was an American Impressionist painter, photographer and artisan. She was skilled in the media of oil, pastel and watercolor. Her professional career was cut short by the Great Depression, but she still continued to paint well into her nineties with a passion for her craft and nature. She is noted for her plein-air painting while camping the American West and its National Parks.
Early life in Chicago
Mary Agnes Yerkes was born on August 9, 1886, in Oak Park, Illinois. Her parents, Charles Sherman Yerkes and Mary Greenlees Yerkes, had moved to their North Grove Avenue home a few years earlier from Ohio. She was the third child of four siblings; Reuben Archibald, Alice Agnew, and Charles Greenlees. Mary Agnes graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in 1906, and became an accomplished local artist.
Her father died in 1908. In 1913, her mother commissioned a house, the Mary Greenlees Yerkes Residence from architect John S. Van Bergen. Van Bergen was a draftsman and then a contemporary of Frank Lloyd Wright. Where most architects catered to wealthy clients, Van Bergen showed a particular interest in designing for both career women and artists. Their home was specifically designed by Van Bergen with an upstairs art studio for Mary Agnes. He even designed some of the first floor's interior trim in to frame some of Mary Agnes' mural paintings.
The Mary Greenlees Yerkes Residence is an Oak Park Preservation Trust award recipient. The Art Institute of Chicago and listings within Oak Park directories show her living at this 450 Iowa address from 1913 to 1919. Her mother continued living with Mary Agnes until her death in California, in 1935.
Yerkes took a two-year course in art history and decorative design at Rockford College. She then studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, where she also taught, and at the currently named School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She had special painting instruction under Wellington Reynolds, John W. Norton and Walter Marshall Clute, and participated in numerous exhibitions, including the exhibits of Chicago Artists, and the American Watercolor Society at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1912 to 1915.
Yerkes had a solo two-week showing in October 1915, about which a Chicago critic wrote:
California and the Depression
"It was..California, and more specifically San Francisco, that became the first mecca for women artists in the West".
In 1917, she married Navy Commander Archibald Nelson Offley, (Archie), and had one child, Mary Yerkes Offley, born in 1918 and who died at the age of 15 from nephritis. The early married life to a naval officer found her transferred to several ports: Portsmouth, Virginia, in the East, and San Diego, Vallejo, Long Beach, and San Francisco, along the coast of California. They eventually took up permanent residence in San Mateo, California, in the 1930s. This time period saw the onset of the Great Depression and she realized that a formal career in painting would be difficult: "The Great Depression of the 1930s and the consequent lack of funds to patronize art severely affected the careers of many artists, both men and women." A few artists during this time were lucky to find jobs through the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in painting murals in public buildings, but for many artists their careers were crushed. This situation was confirmed by Yerkes' own journal, on one weekend's journey to San Francisco from San Mateo in 1935. Yerkes had an appointment with the art director of Gump's Department Store. She left very discouraged because the director said "nobody is buying art during these times". Their lifestyle was modest but far better than most during this period with Offley's secure position at the Office of Censorship in the Navy. Any free time and saved money went for putting gas in the car, to roam the countryside for her artistic exploration.
Plein-air and the National Parks
Yerkes mostly painted en plein-air but she also worked at home in a studio. Numerous photographs were taken by her on each trip to be used as reference later. Archie died in 1945 and Yerkes' painting efforts took a pause. They resumed in the 1950s with encouragement from her second partner, Albert Cobb, although she did not remarry. Yerkes continued to camp and paint the American West well into the 1970s and into her nineties. She also hooked pictorial rugs, wove fabric for her own clothes and accessories, and carved furniture in the same Southwestern and natural motifs she loved to paint. She died in San Mateo on November 8, 1989, at the age of 103. After decades of painting, over [150] of her paintings adorned her own walls at the time of her death. The art world knows her as "Mary Agnes" Yerkes but she, as well as her family members, used "Agnes".

This article is a list of primates of the Orthodox Church in America (OCA).
Prior to the early 1920s, all Russian Orthodox Christians on the North American continent were under the direct jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church. This North American diocese (known by a number of names throughout its history) was ruled by a bishop or archbishop assigned by the Russian Church.
After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, communication between the Russian Orthodox Church and the churches of North America was almost completely cut off. In 1920, Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow directed all Russian Orthodox churches outside of Russia to govern themselves autonomously until regular communication and travel could be resumed. In addition, a handful of Orthodox communities that had been under the Russians but with a non-Russian background turned to Orthodox churches in their respective homelands for pastoral care and governance.
After declaring the autonomy of the North American Diocese (known as the "Metropolia") in February 1924, Archbishop Platon (Rozhdestvensky) became the first Metropolitan of All America and Canada. Since that time, the primate of the OCA has been known as Metropolitan of All America and Canada, in addition to his role as the archbishop of an OCA diocese. When the OCA (then known as the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in North America) was granted autocephaly by the Russian Church in 1970 (an act not recognized by all Orthodox jurisdictions), it was renamed the Orthodox Church in America, and the ruling Metropolitan was granted the additional title of His Beatitude.

Shire Christian School is an independent non-denominational Christian co-educational early learning, primary and secondary day school, located in Barden Ridge, a suburb in the Sutherland Shire area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The school was founded as Sutherland Shire Christian School in 1977 by a group of local parents who felt a calling to provide their children with an environment in which to gain an education taught from a Christian perspective. They believed that these features were not to be seen in a public state school; because of this the school upholds a strong Christian ethos that influences most parts of school life.
In 2015 the school jumped nearly 200 places and ranked 65th in the State in NSW Higher School Certificate (HSC) results.
It was also the last school in New South Wales to ban the use of cane-hitting.
Overview
The school consists of one large campus in the southern suburb of Barden Ridge, and this campus facilitates the two sections of the school:
A high school (Years 7 to 12) and
A junior school (pre-school to Year 6).
In 2016 the school's name was changed to Shire Christian School.
Establishment
The School Association was formally founded in 1969 by several Christian families who wished to have a Christian environment for their children to grow and mature in. The school officially began in 1977 under the name Sutherland Shire Christian School and the Sutherland Shire Christian School Association Ltd was created two years later in 1979.
School classes were originally housed in several locations (such as local church halls) before the purchase of several hectares of farm land in the southern Sydney suburb of Barden Ridge, in 1981, where the school has continued to develop since.
Junior School
The Junior School's curriculum is based around six main subject areas:
English
# Mathematics
# Science and Technology
# Human Society & Its Environment
# Creative & Practical Arts
# Physical Education, Health & Personal Development
High school
Electives
The school offers a wide range of electives at Stage 5 (Yrs 9 and 10) and Stage 6 (Yrs 11 and 12), including extension classes depending upon demand. Students are also able to participate in courses through external providers such as TAFE and language courses offered by the Open High School.
HSC Results
In 2015 the school moved nearly 200 places and ranked 65th in the State in HSC results, making it one of the highest ranking schools in the area in that year. In recent years many final year students have been nominated and selected for the various HSC showcase events.
Facilities and grounds
Location
The school is located in the suburban area of Barden Ridge on Allies Road near Lucas Heights Public School. The school has a scenic bushland setting providing not only shade for students but also a bush playground for junior students.
Facilities
The school has an abundance of facilities on its campus. These include a gymnasium, tennis and basketball courts and cricket nets to cater for all types of students needs and interests. Woodwork and metalwork rooms exist for students, along with a textiles room, a home economics room and several music rooms with recording studio rooms and an array of musical instruments. Two large libraries cater to both the Primary and Secondary schools. A more recent addition is the Tiered Learning Centre (TLC) and refurbished science laboratories.
Extracurricular
There are several extracurricular clubs which run throughout the school each year. These include a sound and lighting team, debating team, a public speaking team, a concert band, junior and senior choirs, junior and senior guitar ensembles and the VIBE string ensemble.
The arts
The school runs an annual drama performance made up of predominantly senior students and several members of drama classes throughout the school grades. These productions are supported by the entire school community through involvement in costuming, lighting, set design and direction. Recent productions have involved students from the junior school.
2007: Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream
2008: Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and Nick Enright's The Venetian Twins: The Musical
2009: Annie: The Musical
2011: Oliver: The Musical
2014: The Wizard of Oz

Rudy Ramcharan (born 1964 in Trinidad) is a Canadian curler from Edmonton, Alberta. He played second for three seasons for Kevin Martin from 1996–97 to 1998–99. He won a Brier as a member of the team in 1997.
Ramcharan joined the team in 1996, and became the first visible minority to win the Brier, being of West Indies descent. The team won the 1997 Labatt Brier and then finished fourth at 1997 Ford World Curling Championships. Ramcharan is one of only two visible minorities to have won the Brier, the other being Bryan Miki, who won the Brier in 2000 with Greg McAulay.
Ramcharan was replaced by Carter Rycroft on the team in 1999, and has since all but disappeared from the curling world. Much of this has to do with a bonspiel he organized in 1999, known as the "World Open Classic". It was originally going to have a purse of $250,000, but due to lack of sponsorships, it was reduced to just $25,000, and many top teams pulled out, embarrassing Ramcharan.
Teams
Personal life
Ramcharan moved to Alberta at the age of 5 and grew up in Alliance, Alberta, where he also golfed. He began curling at the age of 12 or 13. At the time of the 1997 Brier, he was employed as a computer consultant.

The Moorten Botanical Garden and Cactarium is a family-owned botanical garden in Palm Springs, California, specializing in cacti and other desert plants. The gardens lie within Riverside County's Coachella Valley, part of the Colorado Desert ecosystem.
History
The Moorten Gardens were established as a nursery in 1939 by Patricia and Chester "Cactus Slim" Moorten, and developed into the present day garden in 1955. Chester, one of the original Keystone Cops, starred in Two Flaming Youths (1927) and The Sideshow (1928). The Moorten residence was named the Cactus Castle, and was originally built in Mediterranean style by photographer Stephen H. Willard (1894–1966). The Moortens collected many of their own specimen plants from Baja California, mainland Mexico, and as far south as Guatemala. To recognize their contributions to the community, the Moortens were awarded "Golden Palm Stars" on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.
Collections
Ecoregion habitats
The garden includes 3,000 examples of desert cacti and other desert plants, grouped by geographic regions:
Arizona – Sonoran and Yuma Deserts
Baja California Peninsula
California – High Desert–Mojave Desert and Low Desert–Colorado and Yuha Deserts
Colorado Plateau – Great Basin Desert
Sonora, Mexico – Gran Desierto de Altar
South Africa – Succulent Karoo
South America – Monte and Patagonian Deserts
Texas – Chihuahuan Desert
Garden collections
Outdoor collections include: Agaves, Bombax, crested Cereus, Cardoon and Boojum trees, "arborescent candelabra Euphorbia" , a two-story Pachypodium, thorned Caesalpinia and Bursera, and over a dozen Aloes of southern Africa and Madagascar.

The Making of Donald Trump is a 2016 biography of the American businessman, property developer and politician Donald Trump by the American investigative journalist David Cay Johnston.
Johnston first met Trump as a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer in June 1988 and likened him to P. T. Barnum. He subsequently reported on Trump for almost 30 years, and wrote the book in 27 days. In an interview with The New York Times Johnston said that Trump had "...seriously damaged his brand" with his presidential campaign and would "follow him for the rest of his life". Johnston also felt that Trump was "masterful at understanding the conventions of journalism" and "remarkably agile at doing as he chooses and getting away with it".
The book entered the New York Times hardcover nonfiction list in fifteenth position
Description
The book consists of 24 chapters, with an introduction and an epilogue. The book details Trump's family history, personal biography and an account of his business career and marriages.
Reception
David M. Shribman, writing for The Boston Globe, felt that the book was "a chronicle of mobsters and mistresses, shady construction deals and financial shenanigans, monumental projects and miserable (and possibly illegal) business practices" and that "Much of this slender volume's contents are already part of the public record; some of it is new". Shribman noted that the book focuses on Trump's personal and business life rather than his political career and that "More than a dozen Republican candidates and the entire Democratic Party have made the very same argument Johnston puts forward here. It is an important critique, yet an ignored one. Trump may, and probably does, have all these flaws. He also possesses perhaps the most important, and in some quarters surely the most appealing, message in this year of fear and discontent. The book that explains that is the one worth writing, and waiting for".
The book was reviewed by Michael Russell for the Herald Scotland who wrote that the "24 short chapters of the very readable book contain substantial detail regarding Trump's activities since that time. They also dig into his earlier years and some of his family background. As to the truth of these claims, readers will need to make up their own minds". Russell felt that Johnston "sometimes comes across as being almost as self-satisfied and assertive as Trump" but concluded that "Inauguration, unlike baptism, does not wash away sins nor confer wisdom. If even a 10th of David Cay Johnston's stories are true, then Trump is morally, intellectually, culturally, economically, legally and politically unfit for office of any sort. No wonder so much of the world is shaking its head but also holding its breath".
David J. Lynch reviewed the book for The Financial Times and wrote that "Johnston has done voters a service with this unblinking portrait. He makes a compelling case that Trump has the attributes of both "dictator" and "deceiver" and would be a disaster in the Oval Office. ...Yet, ultimately this is a dispiriting read. If Johnston's rendering of Trump is at all accurate, it is not just the New York businessman who deserves rebuke. So too does an entire American political system that has put him within reach of the White House despite his manifest flaws." Lynch was also critical of Johnston's prose style, feeling that "This slim 210-page volume feels a bit rushed: the transitions can be choppy and, like his subject, Johnston has a healthy regard for his own abilities. ...Tip: when you are taking down one of the world's great narcissists, go easy on self-promotion" but that it "is a minor flaw in a work that delivers so much insight".

Daleka obala (trans. Faraway Coast) was a Croatian (formerly Yugoslav) rock band based in Split, active between 1985 and 2002. The band was composed of Marijan Ban, Jadran Vušković, Boris Hrepić, Bogašin Šoić Mirilović and Zoran Ukić. Two members of the band have gone on to form "The Obala", which has recorded 2 CDs to date.
Most songs have been written by vocalist Marijan Ban, with exceptions, such as Kurve and Osamdesete which were written by pianist and guitarist Bogašin Šoić Mirilović. Ban's abstract range of topics had been an influence on Croatian songwriting. Bogašin Šoić Mirilović died on 21 June 2018.
Zoran Ukić's son Roko is a well-known basketball player, currently playing point guard for Cedevita Zagreb.
The band' song Marica is often playing by the Croatia national football team, but mostly by 2 players Dejan Lovren and Šime Vrsaljko. Most fans call it their theme song.

The (c. 230 CE) Shenglei 聲類, compiled by the Cao Wei dynasty lexicographer Li Deng 李登, was the first Chinese rime dictionary. Earlier dictionaries were organized either by semantic fields (e.g., c. 3rd-century BCE Erya) or by character radicals (e.g., 121 CE Shuowen Jiezi). The last copies of the Shenglei were lost around the 13th century, and it is known only from earlier descriptions and quotations, which say it was in 10 volumes and contained 11,520 Chinese character entries, categorized by linguistic tone in terms of the wǔshēng 五聲 "Five Tones (of the pentatonic scale)" from Chinese musicology and wǔxíng 五行 "Five Phases/Elements" theory.
Title
The title combines shēng 聲 "sound; voice; declare; reputation; tone (in Chinese linguistics); initial consonant (of a Chinese syllable)" and lèi 類 "kind; type; class; category; genus; form class (in Chinese linguistics)".
English translations of the title include: Sounds Classified, Sound Categories, Classification of Sounds, Categories of Pronunciation, and Dictionary of Initial Consonants. This last translation interprets sheng 聲 in the 4th-century Shenglei to mean the contemporary linguistic term shēngmǔ 聲母 "initial consonant (of a Chinese syllable)"; exemplifying Yong and Peng's practice of assigning a "startlingly anachronistic English title" to some Chinese dictionaries, such as The Ready Guide for the venerable Erya.
History
Chinese texts from circa the 6th century to the 13th century referred to the Shenglei, after which it was lost. In the 19th century, Chinese scholars collected hundreds of Shenglei fragments and quotations, enabling better understanding of the text.
Many works mentioned the Shenglei together with the second oldest rime dictionary, the (c. 280) Yunji 韻集 "Assembly of Rhymes", by Lü Jing 呂靜 of the Western Jin Dynasty. Neither of these works has survived, but judging by later rime dictionaries, they were clearly stimulated by the fanqie method of indicating character pronunciation. Both borrowed Chinese music terms in order to lexicographically collate words by pronunciation: the contrasting terms qīng 清 "clear; high pitch" and zhuó 濁 "muddy; low pitch", and the wǔshēng 五聲 "five musical tones (of the pentatonic scale)": gōng 宮, shāng 商, jué 角, zhǐ 徵 and yǔ 羽—equivalent to do, re, mi, sol, and la in western solfège.
Northern and Southern dynasties
The first references to the Shenglei and Yunji are from the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420–589). In the period of the Wei to the Northern and Southern dynasties, "lexicography in China entered the stage of exploration and development. There were more new dictionary types coming into being and discoveries were waiting to be made in format and style, in mode of definition, and in phonetic notation."
The (514) Lunshu biao 論書表 "Memorial on Calligraphy", by Jiang Shi 江式, was included by his biography in the (554) Book of Wei history of the Northern Wei (386–535) dynasty. It said, "Lü Jing, the brother of Lü Chen, took examples from [the Shenglei] by Li Deng and compiled [the Yunji] (five volumes). Each tone makes up a volume.".
Yan Zhitui's (581) Yanshi jiaxun 顏氏家訓 "Family Instructions of the Yan Clan" describes the origins of fanqie pronunciation notation and rime dictionaries with Sun Yan 孫炎's Erya Yinyi 爾雅音義 "Sounds and Meanings of the Erya": "Sun Shuyan writing Sounds and Meanings of the Ready Guide (爾雅音義) illustrates the first knowledge of fanqie. Fanqie became very popular in the Wei Dynasty … since then, rhyme books have begun to come out". The Qing dynasty scholar Chen Li (1810–1882) said this passage referred to the Shenglei.
As to 'since then, rhyme books have begun to come out'; Sun Shuyan was referring to Li Deng's compilation of The Dictionary of Initial Consonants, which was the first rhyme book in the history of Chinese lexicography. When the method of fanqie was invented, it was possible to group together characters with the same rhymes, and consequently, rhyme books came into being.
Sui dynasty
The (636) Book of Sui, the official Sui dynasty (581–618) history, first directly referred to the Shenglei and Yunji in two chapters. The "Biography of Pan Hui" 潘徽 compares these two 3rd-century rime dictionaries with four earlier character dictionaries, the Sancang 三蒼, Jijiupian, Shuowen Jiezi 說文解字, and Zilin 字林.
Previous works like Three Cang Primer [三蒼] and The Instant Primer [急就] have merely retained some texts and quotations; those like An Explanatory Dictionary of Chinese Characters [說文] and The Character Forest [字林] only focus on differentiating the form and structure of characters. As for the study of speech sounds and rhymes, there is much doubt and confusion. Either through speculation on ancient characters or interpretation of contemporary ones, the investigations have mostly missed the target. It is in The Dictionary of Initial Consonants [聲類] and The Collection of Rhymes [韻集] that the voiceless is differentiated from the voiced and the tones are demarcated in five scales [始判清濁才分宮羽]. (76)
In a more literal translation, "this book was the first to make distinctions between qing 清 and zhuo 濁, and divide gong 宮 and yu 羽 tones."
The Book of Sui "Bibliography" section (Yiwenzhi) said the Shenglei had ten volumes, and added scarce biographical information that Li Deng held the post of Zuoxianling 左校令 "Left Superintendent" (in the Board of Labor) in the last years of the Wei dynasty. Nothing further is known about him.
Tang dynasty
The Shenglei was in wide circulation during the Tang dynasty (618–907), as evidenced by the two Buddhist dictionaries titled Yiqiejing Yinyi 一切經音義 "Pronunciation and Meaning in the Tripiṭaka". The 25-volume version by the monk Xuanying 玄應 (c. 649–661) cited the Shenglei 207 times, once indicated by author and title, the rest by title alone; the 100-volume version by the monk Huilin 慧琳 (737–820) quoted the rime dictionary 625 times, some only by title, others by author and title.
The (c. 770) Fengshi wenjianji 封氏聞見記 "Master Feng's Record of Knowledge", written by the scholar Feng Yan 封演, was the first work to record the number of Shenglei dictionary volumes and characters. The Wenzi 文字 "Characters" section mentions it in a list of early Chinese dictionaries, "In the Wei dynasty there is a scholar called Li Deng, who compiled The Dictionary of Initial Consonants. It has ten volumes and contains 11,520 characters. It is arranged according to the five tones without further division into sections [以五聲命字不立諸部]." Translating the last sentence as, "the entries in the book were arranged according to five sound classes, but that rime groups were not yet to be established", Tsai notes, "A rime book not organized into rime groups is hardly a legitimate dictionary for riming purposes."
The (945) Old Book of Tang Bibliography lists Li Deng's Shenglei in ten volumes.
Song dynasty
Texts from the Song dynasty (960–1279) recorded the last existing copies of the Shenglei.
Both the (1161) Tongzhi encyclopedia by historian Zheng Qiao 鄭樵 and the (c. 1290) Yuhai 玉海 "Jade Ocean" by Wang Yinglin 王應麟 repeat the Book of Sui bibliographic information that the Shenglei had ten volumes and Li Deng served as "Left Superintendent".
The Shenglei was not recorded in the (1346) History of Song "Bibliography" or in any major private catalogues, indicating that the text was likely lost after the late Song era.
Qing dynasty
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) there was a resurgence of scholarship in the Chinese classics, and several researchers collected fragments of Shenglei glosses from the classics and encyclopedias. Huang Shi 黃奭 (c. 1826) collected 252 citations, and Ma Guohan 馬國翰 collected 73 Shenglei glosses.
Interpretations
Early sources generally agree that the (c. 250) Shenglei rime dictionary contained 11,520 main characters organized by means of the qing 清 "clear" and zhuo 濁 "muddy" contrast pair, and the wusheng 五聲 "the Five Tones (do-re-mi-sol-la) of the pentatonic scale (gōng-shāng-jué-zhǐ-yǔ 宮, 商, 角, 徵, 羽)".
The terms qīng and zhuó had various applications in later phonological writings. In the Song dynasty rime tables, they referred to voiceless and voiced initial consonants respectively, but their Shenglei phonetic interpretation is obscure. The earliest recorded usage of qīngzhuó 清濁 meaning "voiceless and voiced" was in the (581) Yanshi jiaxun 顏氏家訓.
The pentatonic wusheng "Five Notes" were the Chinese musicology correlation of the wǔxíng 五行 "Five Phases; Five Elements" theory about mù 木 "Wood", huǒ 火 "Fire", tǔ 土 "Earth", jīn 金 "Metal"), and shuǐ 水 "Water". The Five Phases/Elements cosmological system has numerous corresponding sets of five. Many sets seem plausible, such as the wǔsè 五色 "Five Colors (blue/green, yellow, red, white, black)"—corresponding to Berlin and Kay's basic color terms hypothesis. Some less plausible Five Phases sets are correlated with naturally occurring sets of four, such as the four tones in Chinese. For instance, the cardinal directions and seasons are stretched into the wǔfāng 五方 "Five Directions (north, south, east, west, and center)" and wǔshí 五時 "Five Seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the 6th month [considered an intercalcary month between summer and autumn])".
The Bunkyō hifuron 文鏡祕府論, by the Japanese monk Kūkai (774–835), quotes Yuan Jing 元兢 (fl. 668), author of the Shisuinao 詩髓腦 "The Bone-marrow and Brains of Poetry", as saying that the Shenglei Five Tones correspond to the sìshēng 四聲 four tones of later rime dictionaries: píng 平 "even/level", shǎng 上 "rising", 去 qù "departing/going", rù 入 "entering/checked". "There are five sounds in music: jiao, zi, gong, shang, and yu. They are so distributed as to represent the four tones of characters, level (ping), rising (shang), departing (qu), and entering (ru). Gong and shang are the level tones. Zi is the rising tone. Yu is the departing tone. And jiao is the entering tone." The following table demonstrates the relationship between the Five Tones and the four tonal categories in the Shenglei according to this account.
However, the four tones were first explicitly identified around the start of the 6th century, by Shen Yue and Zhou Yong 周顒. Joseph Needham finds it "unlikely" that the circa-250 Shenglei used sheng to mean "linguistic tone", as in shēngdiào 聲調 "tone; note; key; melody".
Assuming that the 10-volume Shenglei (possibly with 2 volumes for each tone) and 5-volume Yunji were consistent in format and style, Yong and Peng suggest that the Shenglei must have already been classifying rime sections that were mutually differentiated under each tone. The stylistic features of later rime dictionaries organized according to rime sections based on the four-tone system, with fanqie phonetic notations, and definitions, "were basically present" in the Shenglei and Yunji. The Shenglei started a new era of compiling special rime dictionaries and established the format and style for rime dictionaries and other dictionaries to come.

The 2016 National League Wild Card Game was a play-in game during Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2016 postseason played between the National League's (NL) two wild card teams, the New York Mets and the San Francisco Giants. As both teams finished with identical 87–75 records, a tiebreaker was used to determine the host team. In accordance with MLB tiebreaking rules, the Mets earned the right to host the game by winning their season series against the Giants 4–3.
The game was played on October 5, 2016 at Citi Field in Queens, New York, and the winner advanced to play the first-seeded Chicago Cubs in the NL Division Series. It was televised in the United States on ESPN.
The Giants defeated the Mets, 3–0.
Background
This was New York's third playoff appearance as a Wild Card team, and their second consecutive postseason appearance after winning the National League pennant the previous season, while it was San Francisco's second appearance since 2014, when they went on to win the World Series. It was the second postseason meeting between the Mets and the Giants, after the 2000 National League Division Series.
Game results
Line score
With the winner advancing and the loser finished for the year, each team sent its best starting pitcher to the mound, and the game was a pitchers' duel between the Mets' Noah Syndergaard and the Giants' Madison Bumgarner. Syndergaard did not allow a hit until the sixth inning, and finished with seven scoreless innings and ten strikeouts. On the other side, Bumgarner matched zeroes with Syndergaard. In the top of the sixth, with two outs and a runner on second, Curtis Granderson made a solid catch in center field on a drive by Brandon Belt to preserve the shutout. In the top of the eighth, reliever Addison Reed allowed the Giants to load the bases with two outs on a single and two walks (one intentional), but struck out Hunter Pence to end the inning. In the bottom of the inning, with a runner on second, a hard line drive by Asdrúbal Cabrera right at Bumgarner ended the threat.
In the top of the ninth, Mets closer Jeurys Familia allowed a leadoff double to Brandon Crawford, then after Angel Pagan struck out and Joe Panik walked, journeyman infielder Conor Gillaspie hit a three-run home run to deep right to break the scoreless tie and give the Giants a 3−0 lead. In the bottom of the ninth, Bumgarner returned to the mound and set down the Mets in order for a complete game shutout. Exactly as he had done in the 2014 National League Wild Card Game, Bumgarner had tossed a four-hit shutout to send the Giants to the NLDS.
In popular culture
The Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas, a lifelong fan of the Mets, wrote the 2020 song "Ode to the Mets" while waiting for the 7 train at Mets-Willets Point station immediately following the game; The song is the closing track on The Strokes' 2020 album The New Abnormal. Fabrizio Moretti, the band's drummer, has stated that both the Mets and the song evoke “something that you set your heart to and that you love unconditionally but that continues to disappoint you.”

Eamonn Seán Duggan (; 2 March 1878 – 6 June 1936) was an Irish lawyer and politician who served as Government Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence from 1927 to 1932, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance from 1926 to 1927, Parliamentary Secretary to the Executive Council from 1922 to 1926, Minister without portfolio September 1922 to December 1922 and Minister for Home Affairs January 1922 to September 1922. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1933. He was a Senator from 1933 to 1936.
Early life
Edmund John Duggan was born in Richhill, County Armagh, in 1878, the son of William Duggan, a Royal Irish Constabulary officer, and Margaret Dunne. His parents had met when his father, a native of County Wicklow, was stationed in Longwood, County Meath, where they married on 19 October 1874. The following year, William was transferred to County Armagh as officers could not serve their wife's native country.
In 1911, Duggan was living with his parents on St. Brigid's Road Upper in Drumcondra, Dublin. His siblings, William, Margaret and James, were also living there. There were six children born but only four survived by 1911.
After his school education, Duggan began work as a law clerk. During his early years, he became heavily involved in politics after he qualified as a solicitor and set up a practice at 66 Dame Street in Dublin. Duggan was married to Evelyn Kavanagh and together they had one son.
As a keen supporter of Irish independence, Duggan fought in the 1916 Easter Rising; however, following its failure he was subject to court-martial, and was sentenced to three years' penal servitude. Under the general amnesty of 1917, he was released after 14 months in prison, and returned to Dublin where he went back to studying law. For a period, Duggan also served as Irish Republican Army (IRA) Director of Intelligence.
Duggan was a cousin of revolutionaries Thomas Burke and Christopher Burke through his mother Margaret Dunne.
1916 Easter Rising
In 1916, Duggan was part of Commandant Daly and therefore was serving in the North Dublin Union in the days approaching the 1916 Rising and afterwards Father Matthew Hall. One of Duggan's close friends Thomas Allen was shot while Duggan was at the Four Courts. Duggans efforts to get medical assistance were unsuccessful at Richmond hospital as the British officer who responded to the call declined the message and didn't allow it to go through. Eventually medical assistance was received but it was too late for Allen. In Duggan's region, the volunteers suffered very few injuries with the most violent fighting taking place on Friday night and Saturday morning.
Duggan suffered the consequences and was then sentenced to penal servitude which lasted three years. He was interned in Maidstone, Portland and Lewes prisons. Éamon de Valera and Duggan's attempts at Lewes to fight the authorities and collapse the prison system proved to be victorious as in June 1917, they were both released and Duggan finally got to go back to Dublin and followed his previous roots in law and continued his career as a solicitor.
After 1916
When Duggan was released in 1917, he continued his career in law. Duggan was elected to the First Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin TD for Meath South following the 1918 general election. The Drogheda Independent reported "Never before was a successful candidate accorded such a princely reception".
Duggan engaged in the War of Independence and his role in this was the IRA's Director of Intelligence, this came to an end in November 1920 when he was imprisoned again, and was not released until the Anglo-Irish Truce of July 1921. When the truce concluded, Duggan was authorised as one out of the five envoys to discuss and finalise the treaty with the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. He signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty at 22 Hans Place, London.
Duggan retained numerous ministerial posts in the Cumann na nGaedheal government. In 1921, Duggan played a role in the Irish delegation throughout the Anglo-Irish discussions, he then played a dominant role in liaising with British officials.
Involvement in politics
After the post treaty government, Duggan was appointed the Minister for Home Affairs and shortly afterwards he became the Parliamentary Secretary for the Executive Council and for the Minister for Defence. Duggan continued in various roles as a TD until 1933. These included Government Chief Whip from 1927 to 1932.
Until 1933, Duggan was a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for Meath. In 1933, Duggan declined to go forward for the general election but was elected to Seanad in April 1933. He also was involved in local politics in Dún Laoghaire as the chairman of the Borough Council until he died in 1936.
Duggan's papers
Duggan wrote papers which reflected on his engagement in the Easter Rising. In his letters Duggan wrote about the tough times he spent imprisoned in Lewes, Mountjoy and Portland. Duggan also wrote about his participation in Sinn Féin and how he was released in 1917, and in 1918, how he was triumphant in being a candidate for the South Meath constituency. Most of Duggan's papers consisted of letters to his fiancée and later wife, May Duggan, which he wrote while he was in prison. Duggan's papers were very personal as they consisted of photographs of him, his family members and his political associates etc. Also information of his time as a TD was included. In one of his letters, which Duggan wrote on 25 April 1916, he referenced 'the whole damn family' consisting of information as to how his volunteers and he were being 'treated as princes' by the nuns in the convent nearby, receiving help from the children in the area and building barricades. In his letter, Duggan also writes about morale amongst his comrades and hearing rumours about a German who had landed in County Kerry. News had emerged of Sean Connolly's death and that the British Army were unfair in concluding the rebellion. In Duggan's note, he proclaims that the letter should be sent to May Duggan who was his fiancée at the time. At the end of the letter Duggan referred to himself as 'Edmund' which he is also known as.
Death
Duggan died suddenly at his home in Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, on 6 June 1936, aged 58, and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery on the north side of Dublin.

Dubnica nad Váhom (; Slovak before 1927: Dubnica, , , before 1899 Dubnic(z)) is a town in the Ilava District, Trenčín Region in Slovakia.
Geography
It is located on the Váh river, in the Ilava Basin, between the White Carpathians and Strážovské vrchy mountains, at an altitude of 242 metres. The town's cadastral area is composed of Dubnica and "city part" Prejta, annexed in 1973.
History
Traces of settlement in the place of today's town are from the Stone Age. The first written mention about Dubnica nad Váhom was in 1193 as Dubnicza, when it was a yeoman village. Sometime in the 15th century the village passed to the rule of the Trenčín Castle. After incorporation into Czechoslovakia, construction of a munition factory was negotiated in 1928 and built in 1936.
During the Second World War, a Roma concentration camp was set up in the town. At its height, the camp housed more than 700 Roma prisoners, most of whom had been used as slave labour in the nearby factory and to build a dam on the River Vah. During January 1945 several inmates and one guard fell ill with typhus. On February 23, 1945 the inmates were taken out and murdered to stop the spread of Typhus. This was among the largest killing of Roma in Slovakia during the war.
During the Communist Czechoslovakia, it was one of the biggest arms producers in the whole country. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, the factory was shut down and only fragments are left now.

The subsolar point on a planet is the point at which its sun is perceived to be directly overhead (at the zenith); that is, where the sun's rays strike the planet exactly perpendicular to its surface. It can also mean the point closest to the sun on an astronomical object, even though the sun might not be visible.
To an observer on a planet with an orientation and rotation similar to those of Earth, the subsolar point will appear to move westward, completing one circuit around the globe each day, approximately moving along the equator. However, it will also move north and south between the tropics over the course of a year, so it is spiraling like a helix.
The subsolar point contacts the Tropic of Cancer on the June solstice and the Tropic of Capricorn on the December solstice. The subsolar point crosses the Equator on the March and September equinoxes.
Coordinates of the subsolar point
The subsolar point moves constantly on the surface of the Earth, but for any given time, its coordinates, or latitude and longitude, can be calculated as follows:
where
is the latitude of the subsolar point in degrees,
is the longitude of the subsolar point in degrees,
is the declination of the Sun in degrees,
is the Greenwich Mean Time or UTC,
is the equation of time in minutes.
Observation in specific locations
Qibla observation by shadows, when the subsolar point passes through the Ka'bah in Saudi Arabia, allowing the Muslim sacred direction to be found by observing shadows.
When the point passes through Hawaii, which is the only U.S. state in which this happens, the event is known as Lahaina Noon.

is the fourth studio album by Håkan Hellström, released on 28 December 2005. In English the title corresponds to "Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue." The title describes the nature of the album—some songs are leftovers from earlier recordings, some are newly written ones and a few others are covers. For example, "Jag vill ha allting" is a cover of Luna's "I Want Everything", while "13" is a version of the Big Star song "Thirteen".

Ngawang Lobsang Thupten Gyatso Jigdral Chokley Namgyal, abbreviated to Thubten Gyatso (; 12 February 1876 – 17 December 1933) was the 13th Dalai Lama of Tibet, enthroned during a turbulent era and the collapse of the Qing Empire. Referred to as "the Great Thirteenth", he is also known for redeclaring Tibet's national independence, and for his reform and modernization initiatives.
In 1878 he was recognized as the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. He was escorted to Lhasa and given his pre-novice vows by the Panchen Lama, Tenpai Wangchuk, and named "Ngawang Lobsang Thupten Gyatso Jigdral Chokley Namgyal". In 1879 he was enthroned at the Potala Palace, but did not assume political power until 1895, after he had reached his maturity.
Thubten Gyatso was an intellectual reformer and skillful politician. He was responsible for countering the British expedition to Tibet, restoring discipline in monastic life, and increasing the number of lay officials to avoid excessive power being placed in the hands of the monks.
Early life
The 13th Dalai Lama was born in the village of Thakpo Langdun, one day by car, south-east from Lhasa, and near Sam-ye Monastery, Tak-po province, in June 1876 to parents Kunga Rinchen and Lobsang Dolma, a peasant couple. Laird gives his birthdate as 27 May 1876, and Mullin gives it as dawn on the 5th month of the Fire Mouse Year (1876).
Contact with Agvan Dorzhiev
Agvan Dorzhiev (1854–1938), a Khori-Buryat Mongol, and a Russian subject, was born in the village of Khara-Shibir, not far from Ulan Ude, to the east of Lake Baikal. He left home in 1873 at age 19 to study at the Gelugpa monastery, Drepung, near Lhasa, the largest monastery in Tibet. Having successfully completed the traditional course of religious studies, he began the academic Buddhist degree of Geshey Lharampa (the highest level of 'Doctorate of Buddhist Philosophy'). He continued his studies to become Tsanid-Hambo, or "Master of Buddhist Philosophy". He became a tutor and "debating partner" of the teenage Dalai Lama, who became very friendly with him and later used him as an envoy to Russia and other countries.
Military expeditions in Tibet
After the British expedition to Tibet by Sir Francis Younghusband in early 1904, Dorzhiev convinced the Dalai Lama to flee to Urga in Mongolia, almost to the northeast of Lhasa, a journey which took four months. The Dalai Lama spent over a year in Urga and the Wang Khuree Monastery (to the west from the capital) giving teachings to the Mongolians. In Urga he met the 8th Bogd Gegeen Jebtsundamba Khutuktu several times (the spiritual leader of Outer Mongolia). The content of these meetings is unknown. According to report from A.D. Khitrovo, the Russian Border Commissioner in Kyakhta Town, the Dalai Lama and the influential Mongol Khutuktus, high lamas and princes "irrevocably decided to secede from China as an independent federal state, carrying out this operation under the patronage and support from Russia, taking care to avoid the bloodshed". The Dalai Lama insisted that if Russia would not help, he would even ask Britain, his former foe, for assistance.
After the Dalai Lama fled, the Qing dynasty immediately proclaimed him deposed and again asserted sovereignty over Tibet, making claims over Nepal and Bhutan as well. The Treaty of Lhasa was signed at the Potala between Great Britain and Tibet in the presence of the Amban and Nepalese and Bhutanese representatives on 7 September 1904. The provisions of the 1904 treaty were confirmed in a 1906 treaty signed between Great Britain and China. The British, for a fee from the Qing court, also agreed not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet, while China agreed not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet.
The Dalai Lama is thought to have been involved with the anti-foreign 1905 Tibetan Rebellion. The British invasion of Lhasa in 1904 had repercussions in the Tibetan Buddhist world, causing extreme anti-western and anti-Christian sentiment among Tibetan Buddhists. The British invasion also triggered intense and sudden Qing intervention in Tibetan areas, to develop, assimilate, and bring the regions under strong Qing central control. The Tibetan Lamas in Batang proceeded to revolt in 1905, massacring Chinese officials, French missionaries, and Christian Catholic converts. The Tibetan monks opposed the Catholics, razing the Catholic mission's Church, and slaughtering all Catholic missionaries and Qing officials. The Manchu Qing official Fengquan was assassinated by the Tibetan Batang Lamas, along with other Manchu and Han Chinese Qing officials and the French Catholic priests, who were all massacred when the rebellion started in March 1905. Tibetan Gelugpa monks in Nyarong, Chamdo, and Litang also revolted and attacked missions and churches and slaughtered westerners. The British invasion of Lhasa, the missionaries, and the Qing were linked in the eyes of the Tibetans, as hostile foreigners to be attacked. Zhongtian (Chungtien) was the location of Batang monastery. The Tibetans slaughtered the converts, torched the building of the missionaries in Batang due to their xenophobia. Sir Francis Edward Younghusband wrote that At the same time, on the opposite side of Tibet they were still more actively aggressive, expelling the Roman Catholic missionaries from their long-established homes at Batang, massacring many of their converts, and burning the mission-house. There was anti Christian sentiment and xenophobia running rampant in Tibet.
In October 1906, John Weston Brooke was the first Englishman to gain an audience with the Dalai Lama, and subsequently he was granted permission to lead two expeditions into Tibet. Also in 1906, Sir Charles Alfred Bell, was invited to visit Thubten Chökyi Nyima, the 9th Panchen Lama at Tashilhunpo, where they had friendly discussions on the political situation.
The Dalai Lama later stayed at the great Kumbum Monastery near Xining and then travelled east to the most sacred of four Buddhist mountain in China, Wutai Shan located 300 km from Beijing. From here, the Dalai Lama received a parade of envoys: William Woodville Rockhill, the American Minister in Peking; Gustaf Mannerheim, a Imperial Russian army colonel (who later became the President of Finland); a German doctor from the Peking Legation; an English explorer named Christopher Irving; R.F. Johnson, a British diplomat from the Colonial Service; and Henri D'Ollone, the French army major and viscount. The Dalai Lama was mounting a campaign to strengthen his international ties and free his kingdom from Chinese rule.
In June 1908, C.G.E. Mannerheim met Thubten Gyatso in Wutai Shan during the course of his expedition from Turkestan to Peking. Mannerheim wrote his diary and notes in Swedish to conceal the fact that his ethnographic and scientific party was also an elaborate intelligence gathering mission for the Imperial Russian army. The 13th Dalai Lama gave a blessing of white silk for the Russian Czar. Worried about his safety, Mannerheim gave Tibet's spiritual pontiff a Browning revolver and showed him how to reload the weapon.
In September 1908, the Dalai Lama was granted an audience with the Guangxu Emperor and Empress Dowager Cixi. The emperor tried to stress Tibet's subservient role, although the Dalai Lama refused to kowtow to him. He stayed in Beijing until the end of 1908.
When he returned to Tibet in December 1908, he began reorganising the government, but the Qing sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet in 1910 and he had to flee to India.
In 1911 the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution and by the end of 1912 the last Qing troops had been escorted out of Tibet.
Assumption of political power
In 1895, Thubten Gyatso assumed ruling power from the monasteries which had previously wielded great influence through the Regent. Due to his two periods of exile in 1904–1909, to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910 to 1913 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. The Dalai Lama, "accompanied by six ministers and a small escort" which included his close aide, diplomat and military figure Tsarong Dzasa, fled via Jelep La to Sikkim and Darjeeling, where they stayed almost two years. During this period he was invited to Calcutta by the Viceroy, Lord Minto, which helped restore relations with the British.
Thubten Gyatso returned to Lhasa in January 1913 with Tsarong Dzasa from Darjeeling, where he had been living in exile. The new Chinese government apologised for the actions of the previous Qing dynasty and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position. He replied that he was not interested in Chinese ranks and was assuming spiritual and political leadership of Tibet.
After his return from exile in India in 1913, Thubten Gyatso assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the Maharaja and the British Political officer in Sikkim and the king of Nepal rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it.
Documents from Russian Foreign Ministry archives contain detailed argumentation of the 13th Dalai Lama that Tibet was never a part of China. Thubten Gyatso declared independence from China in early 1913 (13 February), after returning from India following three years of exile. He then standardized the Tibetan flag in its present form. At the end of 1912 the first postage stamps of Tibet and the first banknotes were issued.
Thubten Gyatso built a new medical college (Mentsikang) in 1913 on the site of the post-revolutionary traditional hospital near the Jokhang.
Legislation was introduced to counter corruption among officials, a national taxation system was established and enforced, and a police force was created. The penal system was revised and made uniform throughout the country. "Capital punishment was completely abolished and corporal punishment was reduced. Living conditions in jails were also improved, and officials were designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained."
A secular education system was introduced in addition to the religious education system. Thubten Gyatso sent four promising students to England to study, and welcomed foreigners, including Japanese, British and Americans.
As a result of his travels and contacts with foreign powers and their representatives (e.g., Pyotr Kozlov, Charles Alfred Bell and Gustaf Mannerheim), the Dalai Lama showed an interest in world affairs and introduced electricity, the telephone and the first motor cars to Tibet. Nonetheless, at the end of his life in 1933, he saw that Tibet was about to retreat from outside influences.
In the last decade of his life, the Dalai Lama's personal attendant, Thubten Kunphela rose to power and led several important projects for the modernization in Tibet. In 1931, a new factory complex consisting of currency mints and munition factories was established in Trapchi, with its machines driven by power from the first hydroelectric plant in Tibet. A modern army regiment was created in the same year, after the conflict broke out in Eastern Tibet.
In 1930, Tibetan army invaded the Xikang and the Qinghai in the Sino-Tibetan War. In 1932, the Muslim Qinghai and Han-Chinese Sichuan armies of the National Revolutionary Army led by Chinese Muslim General Ma Bufang and Han General Liu Wenhui defeated the Tibetan army during the subsequent Qinghai–Tibet War. Ma Bufang overran the Tibetan armies and recaptured several counties in Xikang province. Shiqu, Dengke, and other counties were seized from the Tibetans. The Tibetans were pushed back to the other side of the Jinsha river. Ma and Liu warned Tibetan officials not to dare cross the Jinsha river again. Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetans at Dan Chokorgon. Several Tibetan generals surrendered, and were demoted by the Dalai Lama. By August, the Tibetans lost so much land to Liu Wenhui and Ma Bufang's forces that the Dalai Lama telegraphed the British government of India for assistance. British political pressure led to Nanjing declaring a ceasefire. Separate truces were signed by Ma and Liu with the Tibetans in 1933, ending the fighting.
Prophecies and death
The 13th Dalai Lama predicted before dying:
Approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, destroying the vast majority of historic Tibetan architecture.

The Utah congressional elections of 2006 were held on November 7, 2006, as part of the United States general elections of 2006 with all three House seats up for election. The winners served from January 3, 2007, to January 3, 2009.
Overview
District 1
Incumbent Republican Congressman Rob Bishop won re-election to a third term over Democratic nominee Steven Olsen, Constitution Party nominee Mark Hudson, and Libertarian nominee Lynn Badler.
District 2
Although incumbent Jim Matheson (D) won re-election in 2004 by a margin of 13%, his district is in a heavily Republican state. The district includes the most Democratic areas in Utah, such as the liberal communities of Grand County, the large Greek communities of Carbon County, the Navajos of San Juan County, and heavily Democratic Salt Lake City. Matheson is a regular target of the GOP every election. State Representative LaVar Christensen (R) of Draper, a small affluent suburb of Salt Lake City, ran as the Republican nominee in the district. For example, Christensen was one of two major sponsors of a bill that amended Utah's Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. The amendment was rejected by two-thirds of Summit County, half of Grand County, and only passed by 4% in Salt Lake County, while the state as a whole averaged 66%, with the most supportive areas to banning such marriages being located in the first and third districts, not the second. Matheson had approval ratings in the high 70s, the highest for any elected official in Utah.
District 3
Congressman Chris Cannon (R) had represented this district for ten years, but found himself in a competitive primary, just as he had in 2004. In a campaign that focused almost exclusively on the immigration issue, Businessman John Jacob repeatedly attacked Cannon for his support for a guest worker program. In May 2006, at the state GOP convention, Jacob surprised Cannon by winning 52 percent of the delegate ballots. "Cannon's 48 percent showing was especially poor, given that the ballots were cast mainly by the party insiders who dominate such conventions.". The Republican primary was held on June 27, 2006. While polls showed a close race, in the June Republican primary, Cannon received 32,306 votes (55.8%) and Jacob received 25,589 votes (44.2%).

Sir Albert Ernest de Silva (26 November 1887 – 9 May 1957) was a Ceylonese business magnate, banker, barrister and public figure, considered to be the most prominent Ceylonese philanthropist of the 20th century. A wealthy and influential polymath, he was the founder-chairman of the largest bank in Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), the Bank of Ceylon, the founder-governor of the State Mortgage Bank and chairman of the Ceylon All-Party committee. He made many contributions to Ceylonese society and is also considered to be the preeminent philatelist in the history of Ceylon. Upon Ceylon's independence, he was asked to become the first Ceylonese Governor General (representative of the King in Ceylon, i.e. de facto head of state), an honour he declined for personal reasons.
De Silva was at the pinnacle of upper-class society and, as the wealthiest Ceylonese of his generation, he defined the island's ruling class. His memorials describe him as highly respected for his integrity and honesty.
Formative years
Sir Ernest de Silva was born to one of the most affluent families in Ceylon. His parents and grandparents were extremely wealthy and owned much land all over the country. His great-grandfather, Emans de Silva Gunasekere and his grandfather, S. D. S. Gunasekere bequeathed the properties to his father, A. E. de Silva, who later became the wealthiest businessman in Ceylon, and named his son Albert Ernest de Silva Jr. The young heir received his education first at Royal College, Colombo, graduated subsequently from Clare College, Cambridge and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. He was a close friend of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who was a contemplory of his at Cambridge. They met again in 1930 when Nehru arrived for a visit in Ceylon.
Marriage and family
Sir Ernest de Silva's wife, Evadne who, following his knighthood, became known as Lady Evadne de Silva, was herself a prominent philanthropist and, upon independence, became one of the first women in the Senate of Ceylon. He had six children. One of his daughters, Sita, married Business Magnate U. N. Gunasekera, considered to be Ceylon's most notable and influential civil engineer of the 20th century, having built many of the nation's largest buildings, including its first five-star hotels, and a silent philanthropist himself. Another daughter, Swarnapali, married O. R. Medonza who was an Emeritus Consultation Physician at General Hospital (Colombo).
Philanthropy
Sir Ernest de Silva was, arguably, Ceylon's greatest philanthropist of the twentieth century, funding a vast number of charitable endeavours. Among his various projects were the building of four major schools (including Devapathiraja Vidyalaya, Dematagoda Veluvanarama Vidyalaya and Lakshmi College) and providing free education as well as scholarships to its students. Through the Devpathiraja Vidyalaya, Sir Ernest established the inaugural free Buddhist English school in the South, 23 years prior to the establishment of free education in Ceylon and therefore is sometimes referred to as the 'Grandfather of free education' for the conception and successful implementation of the notion. He and his wife, Senator Lady Evadne de Silva, funded the inaugural orphanage in Ceylon in the form of a donation of 9 acres (36,000 m2) in Katunayake.
He went on to establish Ceylon's first tuberculosis sanatorium in Kandana. Sir Ernest also donated a multi-acre cinnamon and coconut estate to cover the expenditure of the organisation. He served as the President of the Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis (CNAPT). Among Sir Ernest's numerous contributions to health care was the donation of the inaugural Radiology unit inclusive of the first X-ray machine in Ceylon to the National Hospital in memory of his father, A.E. de Silva Snr.
As the founder-chairman of the Bank of Ceylon, he also became the governor of the State Mortgage Bank which was established to provide financial assistance to the island's low-income earners. Among his various philanthropic acts were the establishment of the Angela Children's Home, the Parakrama Home, Children's homes in Negombo, Walana, Biyagama, Kandana and Heenatiyana, a maternity home in Bokanda, a Monastery in Salgala, a hermitage in Rajagiriya in addition to the Welisara Children's hospital and a fully constructed hospital at Wanni Athpaththu Kurunegala. He also supported the establishment of worthy charitable organisations such as the Gamini Matha Elder's home, Mallika Home and Harischandra Vidyalaya. He gave away lands, buildings and funds to numerous orphanages, hospitals, schools, social service bodies, temples and hermitages without fanfare or publicity.
Faith
Sir Ernest de Silva was a strong Buddhist who contributed much to the advancement of Buddhism. One such instance was when he purchased an Island (Polgasduwa) in 1911 and offered it to Ven. Nanatiloke, the famous German monk, to start a hermitage for Buddhist monks. The founder-Preceptor, a reputed German Professor who had been ordained in Burma, attracted many scholars and thinkers from all parts of the world, to name a few, from Germany, France, Holland, Yugoslavia, England and the United States of America in the West to the Far East and went on to play a prominent role in the revitalisation of Buddhism in the world. Sir Ernest was thus instrumental in putting Ceylon on the map of the world of philosophy and religion.
When a great disciple of the German monk, Ven. Nyanaponika, had wanted to disrobe and return to Germany to take his Jewish mother away from the Nazi hostilities, Sir Ernest had used his influence and vouched for his mother and relatives and brought them to Ceylon whereupon some resided in one of his estates.
He also built a temple along with this mother: the Veluvanaramaya. He was the President of the YMBA (Young Men's Buddhist Association) and the Kalutara Bodhi Trust and his wife was the Inaugural President of the Ceylon Women's Buddhist Congress. Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was Ceylon's president from 1989 to 1993, said of him that "if there was a Buddhist Temple or school that he did not help, it was not in Ceylon."
Wealth
Sir Ernest was, in his time, Ceylon's richest man and one of the wealthiest Ceylonese of the twentieth century. He inherited and purchased thousands of acres of tea, rubber and coconut estates as well as land in the prominent areas of Colombo. One such estate was the famed 1200 acre (5 km²) Salawa estate which was used as a rubber plantation. And also Rukkattana estate in Bingiriya was another property of him which was used as a coconut plantation. He owned 46 acres (7360 perches) of land mostly in the Cinnamon Gardens (Colombo 7) which, being one of the most expensive areas in Ceylon, would be worth approximately $600 million in the economy of the 2010s. His company dealt in every description of Ceylonese produce, principally plumbago (graphite), desiccated coconut, fibre, cacao, rubber, cinnamon and tea. The main export business was done with the United Kingdom and the continent, through the firm's agents in London, Hamburg and other European ports. His residence, the "Sirimathipaya Mansion", equipped then with horse stables and tennis courts, now serves as the Prime Minister's office.
Hobbies
Aside from public life, de Silva's central passion was stamp collecting. His Ceylonese collection is said to have been world-class, second only to that of King George V. He was said to be one of the most notable philatelists in the world and also owned the legendary orange-red "Post Office" Mauritius One Penny (1847) stamp; considered to be among the rarest and most expensive stamps in the world. In keeping with his charitable ways, he donated the stamp to his relative, Sir Cyril de Zoysa, for the construction of the YMBA headquarters building. Subsequently, the stamp brought $1.1 million at an auction in 1993.
Sir A. E. de Silva was also known to be one of the best Ceylonese billiards players of his time and was the patron of the Ceylon Amateur Billiards Association. He played rounds with the then-world champions in his mansion and club. He was also the president of the Ceylon Turf Club and had the rare distinction of winning two Governor's Cups in Ceylon with his favourites Louvello and L'Allegro as well as a Governor's Cup in Calcutta. As president, he maintained a high level of integrity in the "Sport of Kings". He was also one of the first Ceylonese to own a Rolls-Royce.
Honors
Ernest de Silva was knighted as a Knight Bachelor on 1 January 1946 by King George VI for his public services in Ceylon in the 1946 New Year Honours. In recognition of his services, Flower Road (where he resided) was renamed Sir Ernest de Silva Mawatha and a stamp was issued in his honour. Considered the most respected and wealthiest Ceylonese of his generation, he was offered the position of the first Ceylonese Governor General (Representative of the British Monarch in Ceylon, i.e. de facto Head of State), which he declined due to personal reasons.
Sir Ernest de Silva died at the age of 70, almost ten years after Ceylon gained independence, a cause he strived for. At his funeral, attended by many state officials and leaders, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who was the prime minister at the time, mentioned the loss the nation has to bear with and thanked the departed philanthropist for his services for Sri Lanka, saying that he was a "true gentleman in every sense of the word".

Ildikó Juhász (born 1953) is a Hungarian hospitality worker and lesbian activist most known for creating safe spaces for LGBT community members to gather during the socialist regime. She managed the Ipoly Cinema and after regular screenings invited lesbians to secretly gather for social events. Her after-hours events were the first to offer lesbians a public meeting space in Budapest. After the cinema closed and the regime changed, she opened the Rózsaszín csokornyakkendő (Pink Bowtie), a restaurant and nightclub, which she operated until 1999. In 2021, she was interviewed as a part of the Queer Memory Project, which aims to collect the history of the LGBT community in Hungary and what was formerly Czechoslovakia.
Early life and education
Ildikó Juhász, known as Ildi, was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1953. She had a younger brother and grew up in an intellectual middle-class family. By the time she was fourteen or fifteen Juhász she recognized her sexual orientation, but had no reference points to understand it until she met a fellow student who was gay and who introduced her to other homosexuals. When she came out to her family, they were not happy to learn she was a lesbian, but they accepted it. At the time, there was little information available in Hungary about same sex attraction and most society viewed homosexuality as deviant. Juhász graduated from Eötvös Loránd University with a degree in philosophy and aesthetics.
Career
After she graduated, Juhász began working in the hospitality industry. She was first employed as an assistant director and later as a manager in the nationalized Cinema Company. In the interwar period, all aspects of the Hungarian film industry from production and distribution to exhibition and cinema network management were taken over by the government. In the early 1980s, there were few places that were safe spaces for homosexuals to gather. The two primary social spaces were the Diófa restaurant and when that closed at midnight, an after-hours spot called the Egyetem cafe. There was no specific place for women to gather and as both the Diófa and Egyetem were well-known, police raids or taking down names of people who frequented the establishments was common. The state police, known as the MIAIII, routinely kept dossiers on homosexuals to monitor their activities.
By the mid-1980s Juhász was working at the Ipoly Cinema located in the Újlipótváros neighborhood on the corner of Ipoly and Hegedűs Gyula Streets, which since 1949 had been owned by the Hungarian Communist Party. Juhász began operating a clandestine meeting place for women after the film screening was done for the day. It was the first and for a long time, only place that catered solely to lesbians. The events were not advertised, but spread by word of mouth, and grew because of overlapping social circles which introduced new people to the crowd. She didn't charge for the Friday and Saturday night after-hours screenings, when she showed films with homosexual themes. Fridays were reserved for women, though if gay men showed up at the Ipoly, they were allowed to participate. On Saturdays the hidden bar of the Ipoly welcomed a mixed crowd after the regular theater screenings were completed.
If a film was not being shown the stage was sometimes open for drag shows or other performances, and on another floor typically there was space for music and dancing. Some of the parties were known to have up to eighty participants, but typically the crowd was forty to fifty people. The parties became legendary in the lesbian community and Juhása was seen as a community icon. Many of the lesbians who participated in the film and book project Eltitkolt évek: tizenhat leszbikus életút (Secret Years: Sixteen Lesbian Life Stories, 2011) reported the pivotal role Juhász played in creating lesbian networking opportunities through both the gatherings at the Ipoly and at private house parties.
In 1988, when , the first officially sanctioned homosexual association was registered, activists asked Juhász, even though she was not part of the organization, to organize their fundraising gala. Over three hundred people showed up. Based upon that success, five annual events were scheduled for Homéros. That same year, the Ipoly became the first cinema in Hungary to offer waitstaff service during showings. After the fall of communism in 1989, the 1990s saw many opportunities open up for businesses and allowing LGBTI people to begin living openly. In 1990, the Ipoly was sold and Juhász left the cinema. The following year, she opened her own restaurant and nightclub and the cinema reopened as the L'amour, the first pornographic movie house in Hungary.
The club, Rózsaszín csokornyakkendő (Pink Bowtie), operated at the beginning of Üllői Avenue between 1991 and 1999. Juhász continued to organize lesbian events to allow community members to organize and meet each other. When the gay Jewish group "Szidra" (Cider), which later changed its name to "Keshergay Magyar Zsidó" (Hungarian Jewish Gay Group), decided to organize in 1991, they met at the Pink Bowtie to found their association. Because her new business had to operate as a commercial enterprise and new freedoms had allowed other venues to open, Juhász did not attract the same crowds as previously, and she closed the business and retired in 1999. Juhász was interviewed in 2021 as a part of the Queer Memory Project, a group that focuses on collecting the history of the LGBT community in Hungary and what was formerly Czechoslovakia.

Monogyny is a specialised mating system in which a male can only mate with one female throughout his lifetime but the female may mate with more than one male. In this system the males generally provide no paternal care. In many spider species that are monogynous, the males have two copulatory organs, which allows them to mate a maximum of twice throughout their lifetime. As is commonly seen in honeybees, ants and certain spider species, a male may put all his energy into a single copulation, knowing that this will lower his overall fitness. During copulation monogynous males have adapted to cause self genital damage or even death to increase their chances of paternity.
Definition and distinction
Monogyny is one of several mating systems observed in nature, in which a male mates only once; females, however, may mate with multiple males. It is important to emphasize the distinctions between monogyny and polyandry, and monogyny and monogamy. Polyandry is a mating system by which a female mates with more than one male; the male, in turn, can also mate with more than the one female. In a monogamous setting, both male and female consent to having only one mate at any one time and thus mate only with that partner for that time period. Hence, monogyny is sometimes referred to as male monogamy because the male only mates with one female.
Examples
The mating system of monogyny is most common in ants, honeybees, and spiders.
In colony species
In species of ants and honeybees, there is only one female queen who mates with all the males in her colony; the males attend to the queen and mate only with her. There are circumstances, however, where a colony can become queenless, and therefore certain males must adapt to this surrounding in order to increase paternity. In ants and honeybees, there are two different types of monogynous settings. Type A are monogynous, queenright colonies where the queen is the mated female and everyone else is unmated. Type B are monogynous, worker-reproductive colonies where there is no queen but rather there are gamergates, which are mated workers who take on a queen-like role. The queen is normally the only egg producer. However, when a colony becomes queenless, some workers which have intact, undeveloped ovaries may develop them and thus become capable of laying more eggs. So in certain colonies, a singly mated worker called a gamergate reproduces as the functional queen in that colony. These workers are termed "totipotent"; that is, they are able to change and adapt to a different surrounding in which they no longer have a queen.
In spiders
Males in certain species of spiders often employ drastic methods to be paternally successful. Monogyny in spiders culminates in extreme traits, such as dramatic male self-sacrifice and emasculation of the male by the female during copulation. Since males only mate with one female in a monogynous setting, each individual male must do whatever it takes to increase his particular paternity success, even if it means sacrificing himself. Male redback spiders twist their abdomens onto the fangs of their mates during copulation and, if cannibalized (65% of matings), increase their paternity relative to males that are not cannibalized. In this way, males of the redback spiders in a monogynous setting increase their chance of paternity by actually surrendering themselves to be cannibalized by the female.
Male sacrifice tactics
Genital plugging
The benefits of mate guarding and securing paternity are higher than searching for many mates in a monogynous system. A male securing his paternity becomes a male's first priority during reproduction. One way they mate guard is by creating a physical barrier to turn away any other males. The male can cause severe physical damage to themselves by breaking off their pedipalps in order to plug the genital opening of the female. Males of Argiope bruennichi remove their pedipalp into the females and thus reduce the risk of sperm competition. Males can also remove the sperm of a previous mate from the female and deposit their own sperm, increasing their likelihood of success for that copulation. In the golden orb spider the male may sacrifice both of his copulatory organs in one mating in order to turn away any wandering males. In other cases we see the casting off of other body parts such as the anterior legs in the golden orb spider when the male is attacked by an aggressive female. By doing this he can continue to mate with her while she eats his legs and does not eat him whole.
Self sacrifice and cannibalism
Copulation in a monogynous male is a sacrificial system. They not only cause genital damage to themselves but in many cases die during copulation spontaneously such as Argiope aurantia or are cannibalized by the female. This can be observed in many spider species such as the red back spider which consumes the male either during or right after copulation if the male is not quick enough to escape. The size and age of the female play a role on whether or not the male was able to escape. They usually were not successful in the attempt to escape if the female was older and heavier making her much more dominant than the male. Another factor on the survival or demise of the male is the duration of the copulation. If there is a high copulation time the chances of him being eaten are much higher. If the copulation has a duration of ten seconds or more the chances of him being eaten are much greater than those that jump off before ten seconds. Monogyny increases a male's chance of paternity when there is a male biased ratio in the population. When males make up a large majority of the population, the likelihood of finding multiple females is slim. Thus the males will mate with the first female they encounter. Mate guarding her from other males is more beneficial than looking for another female because the odds of meeting another female in a male biased population are against him.
Costs and benefits
From a male standpoint, evolutionary theory suggests that the focus of mating is to enhance paternity in order to produce viable offspring. Therefore, sexual selection theory would suggest that a male should attempt to mate with several females. This means that if a male wants to ensure that he will be paternally successful, he should mate with more than one female. When the sex ratio is male biased, however, male monogamy (monogyny) would arise as a means of increasing paternity and producing offspring; in other words, if the setting contains a sex ratio of all male to one female, then monogyny would arise as a means to produce offspring. This model predicts that a male-biased sex ratio is required for monogyny to evolve.
For females: the advantages and benefits are significant to that of males and are clear and obvious. The monogynous female is dominant over the males and has great reproductive value.
For males: Since they can mate with only one female, they must adapt in order to increase their chance of paternity.
Male adaptation
Males can adapt in order to increase paternity in a monogynous setting. An example of this would be the formation of gamergates in a queenless colony of honeybees and/or ants. Another example would be male-sacrifice in order to increase paternity in certain species of spiders. The costs of increasing paternity in a monogynous setting are great for the males; in certain species of spiders the male will surrender himself to be cannibalized in order to increase paternity. In this respect, the benefit for the female is that she will receive the chance to eat if she is hungry; the cost for the male is the loss of life to increase his paternity.
In certain species, male adaptation will include the process of pedipalp damage. Males in species of the golden orb weaver, for instance, can protect their paternity by obstructing the female's genital openings with fragments of their copulatory organs. The male will actively participate in damaging his genitals by breaking off parts of his copulatory organs during mating and obstructing the female's genital openings in order to be paternally successful.
Evolutionary significance
Male animals, especially in species where males provide little or no parental investment (time and energy invested in current offspring at the expense of future offspring), are generally expected to maximize their fitness by mating with several females. In certain monogynous settings, however, paternal investment by the male is greater than that of males in other mating systems because the benefits of paternal protection exceed those of searching for additional mates. Paternal investment includes even dramatic examples such as the remarkable adaptation of male sacrifice via sexual cannibalism and the ability to inflict genital damage unto oneself to increase paternity success. In these circumstances, selection may favor extreme mechanisms of paternity protection that amount to a maximal investment in a single mating.
There are also circumstances in which monogyny evolves when males do not provide any paternal investment. Researchers have focused on sexual behaviour in systems where males have low paternal investment but frequently mate only once in their lifetimes, after which they are often killed by the female. Mating effort is high for these males. In particular, time and energy costs or risks incurred by males in securing a given mating could decrease the relative number of males available for mating; this type of mating is called non-promiscuous. Researchers have focused on species of web-building spiders with males that show high levels of non-promiscuous mating effort but apparently low paternal investment. The mechanism of male monogamy (monogyny) in these species is indisputably the most extreme form of non-promiscuous mating effort.

Julia McNair Wright (, McNair; May 1, 1840 – September 2, 1903) was a popular 19th-century American domestic writer. She published numerous temperance and anti-Catholic stories, among which were Almost a Nun; Priest and Nun; The Gospel in the Riviera; The Heir of Athole, Scenes of the Convent; A Wife Hard Won; A Million Too Much; The Complete Home; Bricks from Babel; as well as scientific stories entitled, The Sun and His Family; The Story of Plant Life; The Nature Readers, Seaside and Wayside. She was the main author of Ladies' Home Cook Book: A Complete Cook Book and Manual of Household Duties... Compiled by Julia Mac Nair Wright, et al. (532 pages). Wright died in 1903.
Early life and education
Julia McNair was born in Oswego, New York, May 1, 1840. She was the daughter of John McNair, a civil engineer of Scotch descent. She was carefully educated in private schools and seminaries.
Career
In 1859, she married Rev. Dr. William James Wright, the mathematician. She began her literary career at age sixteen by the publication of short stories. Her published works include Almost a Nun (1867); Priest and Nun (1869); Jug-or-Not (1870); Saints and Sinners (1873); The Early Church in Britain (1874); Bricks from Babel, a manual of ethnography (1876); The Complete Home (1879); A Wife Hard Won, a novel (1882).
Julia McNair Wright's The Field Of Fortune or Practical Life is a 626 page tutorial on the value of Common Sense in all of life's pursuits. The volume's themes are presented by a newcomer visiting the general store/post office in Arcadia, a fictional American town. 'The Stranger' expounds on the value of dedication, hard work and familial love, addressing small groups of the town's elders as well as the young folk, with questions asked, answers offered, and comments/retorts welcomed and discussed.
She also produced The Nature Readers, four volumes (1887–91). Her works were very popular. Most of her stories were republished in Europe, in various languages, and several of them appeared in Arabic. Wright never had a book that was a financial failure; all did well. The Complete Home sold over 100,000 copies, and others reached ten, twenty, thirty and fifty thousand. Since the organization of the National Temperance Society, she was one of its most earnest workers and most popular authors. She wrote on historical, nature, ethnographical, theological, and biblical subjects.
Personal life
She had two children. Her son was a businessman; her daughter, Mrs. J. Wright Whitcomb, a member of the Kansas bar, was an author.
Julia McNair Wright died September 2, 1903 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Fulton, Missouri.

Saint Germerius () (ca. 480- ca. 560 AD) was bishop of Toulouse from 510 to 560 AD. There is some question as to whether he actually existed. He is the patron saint of the abbey of Lézat.
He was a native of Angoulême, or possibly of Jerusalem.
After coming to Gaul from Jerusalem, he was ordained a deacon. He then received an instruction from an angel , telling him to go to Paris where he would be made a bishop at the age of thirty. He did so, and was made the bishop of Toulouse there.
According to one version of his story, on his way to Toulouse, he was summoned by the king Clovis I to the royal palace. There, Germerius gave the Eucharist to the king and his sons and heard their confessions. Later, Clovis asked for the bishop's prayers and offered in exchange whatever Germerius asked. Germerius told him that he wanted an estate in the Toulouse area, exactly, as much area as the shadow of his cloak could cover in Ducorum.
Clovis agreed to give Germerius an area of six miles around Ducorum, and issued a written charter of liberty to substantiate as much. Clovis then requested the bishop to remain a further twenty days, and he agreed to do so.
Upon his arrival in his new territory, Germerius founded two churches. One was dedicated to Saint Martin and the other to Saint Saturninus. The former has subsequently been identified as either the church of Saint-Martin in Ox, a village roughly 4 kilometers southwest of Muret, or the church of Saint-Martin of Roziniac. Both of these churches fell under the possession of the monastic community Germerius founded. Germerius also established the monastery of Saint-Germier, which took possession of all these properties.
Clovis is also reported to have given Germerius a number of other gifts, including vestments, the articles required for liturgical practices.
This version of the story is explicitly included in the life of Germerius published by the abbey, as it makes it clear that the estates of the monastery were given to it by the king himself.
He died at Ducorum. His feast day is May 16.

Gustav Ludwig Theodor von der Heyde (1836–1891) was a 19th-century German-born Auckland businessman. In 1874, he became the Member of Parliament for the Waitemata electorate in Auckland, New Zealand.
Biography
Von der Heyde was born in Bremen in 1834, the eldest son of a businessman. He emigrated to Australia in 1854, working at the Bremen Consulate in Adelaide from 1858 to 1860. Upon the death of John Macfarlane, Von der Heyde became one of the directors of the Henderson & Macfarlane shipping and logging company.
From 1870 to 1874, Von der Heyde was the chairman of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce. In 1871, he was elected to the Waitakerei East Highways District Board, and was a member of the Auckland Harbour Board from 1871 to 1874.
He represented the Waitemata electorate in , which was called after the resignation of Thomas Henderson on 12 June 1874. Von der Heyde represented the electorate from 28 July to 21 August, when he was unseated on a petition. His main political rival, John Sangster Macfarlane, and his supporters, petitioned the Government over the eligibility of Von der Heyde to be a Member of Parliament, due to his German birth. Von der Heyde produced papers showing his naturalisation as a British subject in the Colony of South Australia, however the petition questioned if his naturalisation applied to other parts of the British Empire, or merely the Colony of South Australia. As the South Australian naturalisation law granted naturalised citizens all of the same rights as British citizens, except the ability to become a member of a council or legislature, the election was voided. On 11 August, the executive council approved the naturalisation of Von der Heyde in New Zealand, and on 8 September, a second by-election was held. Von der Heyde was re-elected with a greater majority.
On 15 July 1875, became a member of the Auckland City Council. He remained a Member of Parliament until his resignation on 6 December 1875. As a member, Von der Heyde posed questions on public acts works, such as ports and railways projects. Von der Heyde remained on the Auckland City Council until 1877.
Later in life, Von der Heyde was a consul for Germany, however his role in the Henderson & Macfarlane company caused conflicts of interest, and he stood down from the position. He died in Sydney on 29 June 1891.
Personal life
Von der Heyde married Mary Henderson, daughter of Thomas Henderson, on 11 February 1864 in Melbourne. Between 1865 and 1876, the Von der Heydes had six children. He was an active member of the German community in New Zealand.

Nils Johan Folke Ekström (12 October 1906, in Lund – 25 January 2000, in Saltsjobaden) was a Swedish International Master (IM) of chess and of correspondence chess (IMC). He won the Swedish Championships in 1947 and 1948; Swedish Correspondence Championships in 1941, 1964, and 1971; and the European Correspondence Championship V, 1967–1971.
Tournaments and matches
Ekström was active in high-level national Swedish and international chess during a short period of just over five years in the 1940s, with some very impressive successes. He won at Stockholm 1942, tied with Stig Lundholm, ahead of both Gösta Stoltz and Erik Lundin, both of whom became Grandmasters later on. Then at Stockholm 1943/44, he won ahead of Lundholm. Ekström lost a 1944 match to the world-class grandmaster Paul Keres by 5–1, following Keres' 'hors concours' appearance at the 1944 Swedish Championship, where he had placed second.
Ekström then finished second himself at the strong Hastings 1945/46 tournament, just half a point behind grandmaster Savielly Tartakower, with a score of 9/11. This was ahead of former World Champion Max Euwe, American champion Arnold Denker, and American Olympian Herman Steiner, who all trailed well behind with 7 points. At Zaandam 1946, Ekström shared second with László Szabó, an eventual nine-time Hungarian champion and three-time Candidate, with 8½/11. The winner was Euwe, who made 9½/11. Swedish Olympian Stoltz was next with 8. Then, at Stockholm 1946/47, Ekström tied for first with Lundin. They scored 7/9, ahead of (among others) Swedish Olympian Gösta Danielsson and Finnish champion Eero Böök, who shared third with 6.
Ekstrom won the Swedish Championship in 1947 and 1948. In the late 1940s, he chose to pursue a civil career rather than become a chess professional, and this did not please the Swedish Chess Federation. Ekström was awarded the International Master title by FIDE, the World Chess Federation, in 1950.
Team play
Ekstrom represented Sweden on top board, ahead of Lundin (two) and Danielsson (three), in the two-day, ten-board team match against Denmark, held at Copenhagen in September 1947. Sweden won 12½–7½.
Other than a couple of minor Swedish team events, this seems to be the recorded extent of Ekström's competitive chess career in over-the-board play. He never represented Sweden in Chess Olympiad competition, although he very well could have, based upon his successes, as he was finishing ahead of team members in tournaments during the 1940s. Chess Olympiad competition was dormant during Ekstrom's most active period, due to World War II.
Correspondence play
He played correspondence chess with success as well, earning the IMC title in 1971. Ekstrom was Swedish correspondence champion in 1941, 1964 and 1971. He won the European Correspondence Championship V, 1967–1971. He placed tied 7–8th in the 7th World Correspondence Championship, 1972–1976, with 9/17; the tournament was won by Soviet Yakov Estrin.
Legacy
The Ekström Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is named for him. It runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 c6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5 7.e5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.exf6 gxh4 10.Ne5.

Niccolò di Pietro Gerini ( 1340 – 1414) was an Italian painter of the late Gothic period, active mainly in his native Florence although he also carried out commissions in Pisa and Prato. He was not an innovative painter but relied on traditional compositions in which he placed his figures in a stiff and dramatic movement.
Early life and family
Gerini's father, Pietro Geri, was registered as a member of the Guild of Saint Luke in 1339. In 1368, Niccolò Dipintore is identified as a member of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali Guild (Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries, which included painters until 1378) in Florence. Niccolo worked mainly in Florence, although he also carried out commissions in Rome at the Vatican, and in Pisa and Prato.
Another important artist, Lorenzo di Niccolò di Martino, trained in Niccolò di Pietro Gerini's workshop and later collaborated with him, but was not his son as is sometimes erroneously stated. Gerini did have a son named Bindo di Niccolo di Pietro Gerini, born in 1363, who was registered as a member of the Guild of Saint Luke in 1408.
Career
Gerini represents the school of Giotto di Bondone, in the tradition of Andrea di Orcagna and of Taddeo Gaddi. As is typical for Gothic depictions, Gerini's figures have large chins, sloping foreheads, and sharp noses whilst their bodies are squat and frontally displaced.
Gerini is recorded as collaborating with Jacopo di Cione on frescoes for the Guild hall of the Judges and Notaries in Florence in 1366. He is the Niccolaio Dipintore who worked with Jacopo di Cione on the altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin commissioned by the Albizzi family for San Pier Maggiore, Florence in 1370. He was paid 12 golden florins per disegnare la tavola dell'altare (for the design of the altarpiece) in November of the same year. In addition to the altarpiece, he designed the elaborate throne canopy, while Jacopo di Cione actually produced the piece.
He collaborated with Jacopo di Cione on a second Coronation of the Virgin (Accademia, Florence) in 1372. It was commissioned by the mint of Florence Zecca Vecchia that same year. In 1383 Gerini again worked with Cione on a fresco of the Annunciation in the Palazzo dei Priori, Volterra. This fresco clearly shows the work of two very different artists: Niccolò di Pietro Gerini (design and very fine painting) and Jacopo di Cione (broadly painted saints and side decoration).
In 1386 Niccolò frescoed the façade of the Loggia del Bigallo, Florence. He also frescoed the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milano and executed a Crucifixion in the church of Santa Felicita, both in Florence. His hand can be also seen in the sacristy of the basilica of Santa Croce in the same city, depicting scenes from the life of Christ.
Between 1391 and 1392 he worked in Prato where he frescoed Palazzo Datini and the Church of San Francesco with Lorenzo di Niccolò and Agnolo Gaddi. He also frescoed the capitals of the church of San Francesco, Pisa.

The alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum) is a small insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family. The genus name Empidonax is from Ancient Greek empis, "gnat", and anax, "master". The specific alnorum is Latin and means "of the alders".
Description
E. alnorum is one of the larger Empidonax species, attaining a length of , and a mass of . The wingspan ranges from . Upperparts of E. alnorum are dull greenish-olive. The crown is a slightly darker olive-green than the back. The throat is white, with a darker breast band. Thin white rings surround the eyes. The bill is wide and moderate in length, with pinkish or yellow-orange lower mandible and black upper mandible. Wings are generally black, with white wing bars and white edges of the innermost secondaries (tertials). Juveniles have brownish upperparts, yellow underparts, and yellowish brown or buff wingbars.
E. alnorum is similar in appearance to the eastern wood-peewee (Contopus virens) and the eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), as well as the nearly identical willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) but E. alnorum can be distinguished by its smaller size and upward tail flicking behavior.
Birds in the genus Empidonax are notoriously hard to identify. Novel approaches to identification have been employed to try and increase the accuracy of species identification of mist-netted individuals, such as using ratios of and differences between the measured lengths of various body parts, including wings and beaks. Vocalizations are often relied upon for identification to species in the field when birds cannot be manipulated by hand.
Taxonomy
The alder flycatcher is sibling species with the willow flycatcher (E. trailli). The two species were grouped together as one species, the Traill's flycatcher, until 1973, when differences in vocalizations and habitat use lead to their acknowledgement as distinct species, which has since been supported by genetic data. A study analyzing the genetic makeup of 12 Empidonax species found that the Alder and Willow Flycatcher are each other's closest relatives. The Tyrant flycatcher genus is closely related to the Wood-Pewee genus (Contopus), and a hybrid of the two genera was reported to have been caught in Idaho.
Habitat and distribution
The summer breeding range of the species covers most of Canada and Alaska, descending to a southernmost point in the northeastern United States. In autumn, E. alnorum migrates south through the eastern United States, Mexico and Central America, wintering in the western range of South America.
In the summer breeding season, E. alnorum occupies wet, dense, shrubby thickets of alder (Alnus sp.), maple (Acer sp.), and birch (Betula sp.) at elevations below . During migration, the species occupies humid and semi-arid habitats, including forest edges and fields at elevations up to . Early successional scrubby vegetation or woodland edges are preferred habitats in winter, particularly those near water and below .
Behavior
Vocalizations
The vocalizations of the alder flycatcher are very useful for its identification in the field. The song is a distinct "fee-bee-o"; birds have been observed to throw their heads back and shake their tails while singing. There are a variety of calls generated by E. alnorum, the most common of which is a "pit" sound produced when foraging. Other calls include those associated with aggressive or territorial behavior, including "double-peak", "zwee-oo", and "wee-oo" calls, and those linked with excitement, such as a "kitter" call.
Diet
E. alnorum diet is composed primarily of insects such as those from the Hymenoptera (sawflies, bees, wasps and ants), Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Orthoptera (locusts, grasshoppers and crickets) families. Insects are captured during flight or gleaned from foliage of trees. In the winter, some birds will include fruit and seeds in their diet.
Reproduction
The alder flycatcher breeds in wet thickets of maple, alder and birch. Nests are positioned low in bushes within shrubby thickets, and are cup-shaped, built loosely of vegetative materials such as grass, weeds, pieces of bark, and small twigs. Strips of grass or bark can often be seen dangling from the bottom of the nest, and the inside is lined with soft materials such as plant down. Females primarily engage in nest building activities.
Male E. alnorum vocalize to defend their breeding territory. As the species has not been extensively studied, courtship behavior is uncertain, but is believed to involve males chasing females through the trees.
3–4 eggs are laid per breeding season, and are creamy-white or buff in color and speckled with dark markings near the larger end of the egg. The female incubates the eggs for 12–14 days. Hatchlings are altricial and covered with tiny spots of olive-brown down. Both the male and female are involved in caring for the young. Juveniles take their first flight around 13–14 days of age.
Conservation status
E. alnorum is a species of the least concern according to the IUCN Redlist. Population numbers are stable in the United States, but have declined in Canada by approximately 44% in the period 1966–2014. The species has a rating of 9 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score, and is a U.S.-Canada Stewardship species.

"This Is Me" is a song performed by German girl band Monrose. It was written by Mich Hansen, Jonas Jeberg, Paul Barry and All Saints band member Shaznay Lewis and recorded for the trio's fourth studio album Ladylike (2010). Production was overseen by Pete Kirtley, Christian "TheFatRat" Buettner and Marcello "Cello" Pagin. Introduced by an a cappella solo by band member Mandy Capristo, who also serves as the song's leading vocalist during its chorus, "This Is Me" is a pumping dance-pop song with heavy elements of synthpop and electronic music; its lyrics explore themes of self-confidence, independence and stamina.
Starwatch Music released the song as the album's second single and band's tenth overall single on 27 August 2010, following an online poll on Monrose's official website that was set up to determine which of the album's tracks was the favourite of fans, beating out "Breathe You In" and "Mono". Upon its release, the song became a moderate commercial success, peaking at number 22 on the German Singles Chart and at number 28 on the Austrian Singles Chart. Its accompanying music video was filmed by director Lennart Brede in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and It features a rotating triple split-screen effect.
Music video
The accompanying music video for "This Is Me" was directed by Lennart Brede and filmed on August 1, 2010 in the Berlin borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. It features a rotating triple split-screen effect which critics compared to the music video for American girl band Destiny's Child's "Emotion" (2001). Filming locations include Warschauer Brücke, Warschauer Straße, Falkensteinstraße, Luisenstadt Canal, and U-Bahn station Schlesisches Tor. Production was helmed by Mutter & Vater Productions, while editing was overseen by Chris Heidrich.

Kestose is a class of sugars that belongs to a group of fructooligosaccharides.
Chemical properties
Kestoses are typical fructooligosaccharides, and in its structure, one fructose molecule is combined with sucrose to form a trisaccharide. In the 1-kestose type, the fructose molecule will be connected to sucrose by a (1→2β) glycosidic bond. Different types of kestoses have different lengths of subunits in the chain, for example, 6-kestose has from 10 to 200 fructose residues and is also called levan type fructooligosaccharide. Also, 1-kestose has less than 50 fructose residues in the chain and is also called inulin type fructooligosaccharide.
Kestoses are categorized based on their structure into 3 main groups: 1-kestose, 6-kestose, neokestose. The most common of them is 1-kestose which is found in many plants.
Biosynthesis
According to the conditions of the plant cell, kestose biosynthesis occurs in the vacuole. The precursor molecule of kestose is sucrose. The sucrose-sucrose fructosyl transferase enzyme relates a sucrose molecule with a fructose residue to a second sucrose molecule, producing a kestose-1 molecule. Following, the enzyme fructan-fructan 1-fructosyl transferase combines fructose residue from trisaccharides, and by that synthetase longer kestose-1 chain. Respectively, to synthesize 6-kestose chain, the enzyme fructan-fructan 6-fructosyl transferase should combine fructose residue from trisaccharide and that synthesize a longer chain.
Food sources
As well as other fructooligosaccharides, kestose can be found in such plants as wheat, onions, asparagus, and banana. Moreover, the plant families of Compositae, Amaryllidaceae, Gramineae and Liliaceae contain kestose along with other fructooligosaccharides in parts of the plant such as fruits, roots, and tubers.
Industrial production
In the industry, kestose, like other fructooligosaccharides, is produced by transfructosylation reaction of sucrose with the enzyme B-fructofuranosidase, which is obtained from the mold fungus Aspergillus niger.
Potential health effects
Prebiotic activity
Kestose as well as many other fructooligosaccharides belong to the prebiotics, i.e. to the substances that have a positive effect on the intestinal microbiome after consuming them in food. In particular, the consumption of kestose mixed with other fructooligosaccharides increases the concentration of healthy probiotic bifidobacteria and decreases the concentration of the Clostridia, bacteria associated with inflammatory processes.
Consequently, kestoses complies with the essential criteria required for a prebiotic: 1) they are not digested by enzymes of the mammalian host organism, 2) they have a positive effect on only positive probiotic microorganisms growth, 3) they have a positive effect on the microbiome in general, 4) they have a positive effect on the defense system of host organism.
Consumption with food
Kestose has less caloric value than sucrose, and is not a promoter of tooth decay. Consumption of kestose, as well as other prebiotics, reduces the risk of cancer, hyperlipidaemia and acute gastroenteritis.
In particular, kestoses perform their prebiotic function by positively influencing the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria probiotics, which protect the host organism from acute gastroenteritis, which appears when pathogenic microorganisms multiply in the intestines and has symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and pain in the abdomen.
Impact of kestose-1 on glucose metabolism in rats with type 2 diabetes
Studies on rats have shown that the consumption of kestose-1 helps the propagation of probiotics such as Anaerostipes caccae in the intestinal microflora. These probiotics are butyrate producer bacteria, which through the production of butyrate contribute to glucose tolerance and weight loss in rodents. Also, the consumption of kestose-1 by rats promotes the multiplication of probiotics of the bifidobacteria class, which produce the metabolites acetate and lactate, which in turn Anaerostipes caccae also uses to synthesize butyrate.
Impact of kestose-1 on symptoms of the atopic dermatitis disease
Studies show the positive effect of consumption of prebiotic kestose-1 on the reproduction of microorganisms Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which have an anti-inflammatory effect due to the production of short-chain fatty acid - butyrate. Butyrate in turn promotes the differentiation of regulatory T cells, which have the function of suppressing the production of T helper 2 cytokines that cause inflammatory processes in allergic reactions such as atopic dermatitis disease. Significant results were achieved with the consumption of kestose-1 for multiplication of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii probiotic, and in the consequence of relief of symptoms of atopic dermatitis disease in children aged 2 to 5 years, after 6 weeks of consumption of kestose-1 in food.[8]

Microseris laciniata is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae known by the common name cutleaf silverpuffs. It is native to the western United States from Washington to northern California and Nevada, where it grows in forest and grassland habitat.
Description
It is a perennial herb growing up to a meter tall with a branching stem. The plentiful leaves are 10 to 50 centimeters long and variable in shape, with smooth, toothed, or lobed edges. The inflorescence is borne on a tall, erect or curving peduncle. The flower head may be 3 centimeters long when in bud and wide when in bloom, bearing up to 100 or more long yellow ray florets.
The fruit is an achene with a gray or brown body a few millimeters long. At the tip of the body is a large pappus made up of 5 to over 20 long, hairy scales, each of which may exceed one centimeter in length.
There are four Microseris laciniata subspecies.
Uses
The root, though bitter, was used for food by Native Americans of Mendocino. The milky sap was left out in the sun and used as a gum.

George J. Lewis (December 10, 1903December 8, 1995) was a Mexican-born actor who appeared in many films and eventually TV series from the 1920s through the 1960s, usually specializing in westerns. He is probably best known for playing Don Alejandro de la Vega, who was Don Diego de la Vega's father in the 1950s Disney television series Zorro. Lewis co-starred in Zorro's Black Whip and had a minor role in Ghost of Zorro before starring as Don Alejandro in the Disney series.
Career
Lewis broke into films in the 1920s, and his handsome presence led to leading roles in a Universal Pictures short-subject series, The Collegians. The arrival of sound movies came as a blessing for Lewis, who was bilingual. He spoke English without any trace of accent, and could play character or dialect roles of practically any ethnicity. His language skills earned him leading roles in Spanish-dialogue features, produced by American studios for international release. He also played supporting roles in Educational Pictures shorts.
Most of Lewis' screen work was in low-budget films, although he can be seen in a few major productions (in Casablanca he's an Arab peddler with a monkey). Some of his roles were sympathetic; he played the male leads in the 1944 serial Zorro's Black Whip and in the Vera Vague comedy shorts of the 1940s. Usually, George J. Lewis played villains in westerns and serials, chiefly at Republic Pictures. Cast as a sinister henchman, Lewis would carry out the villain's diabolical orders, setting death traps and ambushes week after week. The high point of Lewis's serial career was probably the 1945 Republic cliffhanger Federal Operator 99, in which he was the full-fledged villain of the piece, playing "Moonlight Sonata" on a piano while plotting crimes. Holding the heroine captive, the nonchalant Lewis asks the hero: "What will it be? Cash for me... or incineration for Miss Kingston?" He appeared in Three Stooges films as Vernon Dent's knife-wielding conspirator in the Stooge short Malice in the Palace, and its remake, Rumpus in the Harem. He was also featured with the Stooges (as George Lewis) in Hollywood's final two-reel comedy release, Sappy bullfighters.
Many low-budget filmmakers scored successes in early television, and many familiar faces turned up in half-hour action fare.
Lewis appeared in the first two episodes of The Lone Ranger which were "Enter the Lone Ranger" and "The Lone Ranger Fights On". He was a villain who helped betray a group of Texas Rangers and led them all into a deadly ambush, with the series star of course being the lone survivor. He played a Native American in an Adventures of Superman episode called "Test of a Warrior."
Lewis was cast as General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo in the 1956 episode, "The Bear Flag" of the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The episode explains the tensions in 1846 between established Hispanic families in California and the newly-arrived white settlers from the United States. General Vallejo seeks accommodation with the forces headed by Ezekiel "Stuttering Zeke" Merritt (Don C. Harvey) in establishing the short-term Bear Flag Republic.
Lewis continued to work in dozens of television episodes including Daniel Boone & Cheyenne until he retired in 1969.
Death
Lewis died of a stroke in 1995, two days before his 92nd birthday.

Cream of Tartar Works Platform was a railway station located on the Sandown railway line in the then-industrial suburb of Camellia in Sydney, Australia. The station opened 7 March 1927 and served the Australian Cream Tartar Company factory in Camellia. It closed in July 1959, the same year the Sandown line was electrified in August.
Cream of Tartar was among a number of companies that had private sidings on the line.

Lemoore Army Air Field, located nine miles (14 km) southwest of Lemoore, California, was a dirt air field usable only in dry weather. It nevertheless was used by the AAF Western Flying Training Command as a processing and training field.
The site of Lemoore AAF is located south of the intersection of Route 198 & 27th Avenue, two miles (3 km) west of the main gate of Lemoore NAS.
History
This base was built during World War II as an Army Air Forces training field. The Federal Government acquired for the Lemoore Basic Flying School in 1941–42. Approximately were acquired in fee by grant deed from individual landowners, were leased from the City of Lemoore and were acquired by transfer from the National Housing Agency.
According to a World War II-era diagram, the field consisted of a roughly triangular shaped landing mat, which measured 3,470' along its longest side. A 3,700' long north/south apron sat to the southwest of the landing mat, and west of the apron was the building area. In addition, the airfield had a PX gas station, 10 gas tanks, a truck fill station, oil & lube station, motor repair shop with 4 grease racks & 4 underground tanks, fire station, cadet quarters, warehouses, officers quarters, mess hall, utilities shop, chapel, classrooms, water reservoir & water well, taxiways, runway, landing field, and two hangars.
Additional structures constructed by the Army for the Lemoore site were located south of the area shown on the 1941 & 1942 site maps, including an amphitheater & swimming pool.
Lemoore AAF was described by the 1944 US Army/Navy Directory of Airfields as having a 6,500' hard-surface runway, although the remarks included, "Entire field available only when dry."
Known sub-bases and auxiliaries were:
Boston Field (A-1) (abandoned, now farmland)
Huron Field (A-2) (abandoned, now farmland)
Indian Field (A-3) (abandoned, now farmland)
Murray Field (A-4) (abandoned, now farmland)
West Field (A-5) (abandoned, now farmland)
Summit Lake Field (A-6) (Now NAS Lemoore)
Helm Field (A-7) (abandoned, now farmland)
Corcoran Municipal Airport
Porterville Army Airfield (Now Portersville Municipal Airport)
Coalinga Municipal Airport (Old) (Closed)
On March 5, 1944, the Jack Benny Radio Program broadcast live at the base. Jack Benny, Don Wilson (announcer), Dennis Day, Mary Livingstone, Phil Harris, and Eddie "Rochester" Anderson were the cast. Day sang A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening and The Way You Look Tonight.
Postwar use
On 25 September 1945, Major General Willis H. Hale, Fourth Air Force, notified Lemoore Army Air Field that it was temporarily inactivated.
The Lemoore AAF site was declared surplus by the War Assets Administration on 11 January 1946, and was evidently reused as a civilian airfield, as that is how it was depicted on the 1953 San Diego – San Francisco Flight Chart. Apparently the airfield had also been significant expanded at some time after World War II as the 1953 chart depicted the field as having a 6,100' runway.
According to the 1 February 1957 issue of the Fresno Bee, the site of the former Army Airfield was sold by the City of Lemoore in 1957 to the Navy, to be used as part of the site for the new Lemoore Naval Air Station. The present-day Lemoore Naval Air Station is just a few miles to the north of the former Lemoore AAF. Ironically, the northern end of the runways of the huge Lemoore NAS sit on the same ground previously occupied by Lemoore AAF's satellite field A-6 Summit Lake.
In the 1950s the Air Force considered placing a long range radar station on the site of Lemoore AAF. Although planned to operate under the Air Defense Command. this site, known a P-74A, was never built. The Lemoore airfield had evidently been abandoned at some point between 1957–59, as nothing at all was depicted at the site on the March 1959 Mt. Whitney Sectional Chart
The 1963 World Aeronautical Chart depicted the “Abandoned Lemoore” airfield as having a single northwest/southeast runway. It also showed that a “Navy Lemoore” radio beacon had been added on the north side of the Lemoore AAF site, and the much larger runways of the newly constructed NAS Lemoore were also depicted to the north.
Ironically, the northern end of the runways of the huge Lemoore NAS were constructed on the same ground previously occupied by Lemoore AAF's satellite field A-6 Summit Lake. At some point between 1963–64, the former Lemoore AAF was evidently reused as a short-lived private civilian airfield, as the June 1964 Mt. Whitney Sectional Chart depicted a “Willett” private airfield at the site.
The private airfield evidently used a subset of the former military runways (or possibly a portion of the former paved ramp area), as the Aerodromes table on the chart described Willett as having two concrete runways with the longest being only 3,200' (roughly half the length listed on the 1957 chart).
The Willett airfield evidently lasted no more than 3 years, as no airfield was depicted at the site on the June 1966 Mt. Whitney Sectional Chart or the 1967 Mt. Whitney Sectional Chart. In the early 1970s the western portion of the former airfield site was leased by McCarthy Land Company which used the facility for the manufacture of farming supplies and utilized some of the former airfield structures for an agricultural chemical laboratory.
Dianne Avila acquired the western of the former site in 1973, which included all of the former airfield facilities Information available from the County of Kings Department of Public Health Division of Environmental Health Services indicates that the airfield was operated as a crop dusting airstrip for a number of years by intervening owners, and approximately in 1975 the runway was removed & the area developed for agriculture purposes.
The eastern of the former Lemoore site was acquired in 1980 by the Leonard Oliveira Farming Company. As of a 1989 Army Corps of Engineers report, the former Lemoore AAF site was owned by two private individuals. Dianne Avila owned the western portions of the former airfield site that included the aircraft maintenance buildings, hangars, and parking areas. She used her property as an orchard.
The Leonard Oliveira Farming Company (also known as the Double 0 Ranch) owned the eastern portion of the former airfield site which previously contained the taxiways, runways and parking area for the airplanes. That property was also used to raise crops.
The report described the remaining structures on the site as 2 hangars, 3 warehouses and Z barracks-type buildings, which were described as appearing to be structurally sound. Two other buildings appeared to be less well-maintained. One of the two buildings appeared to be abandoned with windows broken & no doors in the doorways. A Google satellite view of the site dated 2022 shows the words "Navy Fuck'N Rocks!" painted in the U.S. Navy's blue and gold colors on the roof of the smaller of the two remaining hangars near the southern edge of the property.

Tong sui (), also known as tim tong, is a collective term for any sweet, warm soup or custard served as a dessert at the end of a meal in Cantonese cuisine. Tong sui are a Cantonese specialty and many varieties are rarely found in other regional cuisines of China. Outside of Cantonese-speaking communities, soupy desserts generally are not recognized as a distinct category, and the term tong sui is not used.
In Hong Kong, Macao and Malaysia, a large variety of tong sui is served in tong sui specialty stores. Tong sui stores have also gained prominence in overseas Chinese communities, and are found in various parts of Canada, Australia and the United States.
History
Tong sui shops in Hong Kong mainly originated from the postwar period. Chinese migrants brought their hometown sweet soups to Hong Kong, such as red bean soup from Guangzhou and tang yuan from Shanghai. Newcomers sold tong sui in newly opened street side food stalls and Chinese tea house.
During the 1980s to 1990s, Hong Kong's economy developed rapidly and living standards rose. Western desserts and sweet soups were imported to Hong Kong by Western hotels or cooks who had studied in the West. Under Western influence, people started using fresh fruits to create new-style tong sui such as tapioca pudding. Many Chinese herbal tea shops like Hui Lau Shan transformed into tong sui shops.
In the 21st century, chain tong sui shops have become more prominent and recommended as tourist attractions by The Hong Kong Tourism Board.
Traditional tong sui
Historically, the basic ingredients of traditional sweet soups are beans, milk, and fruits. The desserts and sweet soups provided in the menus of the traditional tong sui shops are mainly the Chinese-style sweet soups. Staples like red bean soup and sweet almond soup are common types of sweet soups sold in the ordinary tong sui shops.

Arvfurstens palats (Palace of the Hereditary Prince) is a palace located at Gustav Adolfs Torg in central Stockholm.
Designed by Erik Palmstedt, the palace was originally the private residence of Princess Sophia Albertina. It was built 1783-1794 and declared a historical monument (byggnadsminne) in 1935 and subsequently restored by Ivar Tengbom in 1948-52. Since 1906 the palace has served as the seat of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The palace is facing the square Gustav Adolfs torg, with the Royal Swedish Opera on the opposite side. Located near the palace are the Sager Palace, official residence of the prime minister, and Rosenbad, official office of the government. The bridge Norrbro stretches past the building of the Riksdag on Helgeandsholmen and further south to Stockholm Old Town and the Royal Palace.
History
Lennart Torstensson (1603–51), a successful general, bought the area west of the square and had his palace built there 1646-51. The main entrance of this building was facing Fredsgatan, the street passing north of the site, while the southern part of the site was still occupied by one-story wooden structures. This was a German-Dutch Renaissance palace in brick in a style widely favoured all over Europe at this time. One of the rooms from this era is still preserved; the former kitchen now serving as the office of the Chief of Protocol. Lennart's son Anders, governor of Estland, made unsuccessful attempts to sell the property to save his economy, and the palace was subsequently taken over by the Crown in 1696 but eventually given back to Torstensson's heir.
King Gustav III's sister Princess Sophia Albertina bought the property in 1793. The king, who wished to give his sister a residence in accordance to her station, commissioned architect Erik Palmstedt to create a new palace which should include the old and adopt the plans for the area north of the Royal Palace.
The architect not only had to create a copy of the building on the opposite side of the square, he was also ordered to ensure the old Renaissance palace would be included into the new, a demand which reflects Gustav III's passion for Gustavus Adolphus and his era.
While Sophia Albertina, before her death in 1829, had the palace bequeathed to the Swedish heir presumptive (i.e. the hereditary prince), it was during the ensuing decades used by court officials and as offices for various authorities, a faith which would eventually prevail. Before Oscar II became king in 1872, he and his wife Sofia used the palace as their residence, where their son, Gustav V, and other members of the royal family, including Prince Eugén, spent parts of their childhood.
The ministry for Foreign Affairs moved there in 1906, but had to share the building with several other authorities until 1936. A comprehensive restoration was made 1948–1952, which among other things resulted in the addition of a building on the courtyard.
Exterior
During the era of the Swedish Empire, Gustav Adolfs torg, the square in front of the palace, was developed into one of the most prominent public spaces in Sweden. It is centred on the equestrian of Gustavus Adolphus by Pierre Hubert L'Archevêques. This project was based on Tessin the Younger's plans for the rebuilt Royal Palace and its immediate surroundings. East of the square, a new opera building was erected in 1782 (demolished in 1892) and the façade on the western side was designed as a copy of the former, echoing its pilasters and the columns of the accentuated central portion. The entire setting was inspired by the Place de la Concorde in Paris. And like in the French capital, several other aristocrat residences were built in the surrounding area. Some of the grand visions Tessin developed were carried through with the construction of the bridge Norrbro, even though the centrepiece in his plans, a royal church on the northern side of the square, remained a dream.
A large Renaissance sandstone portico from the original Torestensson Palace on the northern side, was restored in the 20th century, and its present appearance thus reflects the original design of Diedrich Blume from 1647. An identical portico is still found on the courtyard.
Interior
Matsalen ("Dining Room") or Stora konferensrummet ("Great Conference Room") was originally divided into three separate rooms during Torstensson, but these were united into a single space in the mid-18th century and are since then used for official dinners and conferences. On the walls hang the portraits of past ministers for foreign affairs and a large portrait of Axel Oxenstierna.
Stora salongen ("Great Salon") or Blå salongen ("Blue Salon") is a salon designed by the Louis Masreliez in a style called Late Gustavian style. This, the central and largest room in the piano nobile, was used as an archive during WWII and was at the time in a bad shape. It has since been restored and is today used for official receptions. It has cut glass chandeliers, two sandstone stoves, and textiles in the original blue and white colours. It also features the busts of Gustav III and his sister Sophia Albertina by Johan Tobias Sergel, as well as four sculptures donated by the Italian government.
In Audiensrummet (the "Audience Room"), because of the red textiles also called Röda salongen (the "Red Salon"), Sophia Albertina used to receive her guest sitting in a gilded throne under a baldachin, the prominence of the scene underlined by the royal coat of arms topped by a princess crown over the four doors. Today it serves as the office room of the Minister's press secretary and his/her staff. The preserved wood carvings were executed by Gottlieb Iwersson, one of the most distinguished furniture designers of the late 18th century, with ornaments carved by Jean Baptiste Masreliez, Louis Masreliez's brother.
During the era of Sophia Albertina, Sällskapsrummet (the "Drawing Room") served a salon where she and her courtiers could spend hours conversing and embroidering. The wall frameworks by Louis Masreliez featuring nymphs, cupids, and muses, were once surrounding the embroideries produced by the princess and her court, but are today replaced by wallpapers with painted flowers. Since the ministry took position of the palace this room serves the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the room are two 17th century desks by Gottlieb Iwerson and Georg Haupt, the latter featuring an ornamental inkstand originally intended to be a gift to Marie Antoinette.
Arbetsrummet (the "Study") originally served as the princess' bedroom and later as her waiting room. Today it is the office of the Under-secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (kabinettsekreterare). Many of the furnitures in the room date back the Princess' era and are still found on their original locations, as are the painting Belshazzar's Banquet and the Rococo cabinet featuring with the Swedish Coat of Arms in bronze.

Years of the 17th century in literature
The Public Libraries Act 1850 (13 & 14 Vict c.65) was an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament which first gave local boroughs the power to establish free public libraries. The Act was the first legislative step in the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature, and was indicative of the moral, social and educative concerns of the time. The legacy of the Act can be followed through subsequent legislation that built on and expanded the powers granted in 1850 and the 4,145 public libraries that exist in the United Kingdom in the 21st century can trace their origins back to this Act.
Historical background
In the 1830s, at the height of the Chartist movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. This prompted much new legislation to be passed, such as the Parliamentary Reform Act 1832, the Factory Act 1833, the first instance of a government grant for education in the same year and the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The capitalist economic model had created shift patterns which left workers with free time, in contrast to the agrarian model, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle-class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders. Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.
In 1835, and against government opposition, James Silk Buckingham, MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the temperance movement, was able to secure the Chair of the select committee which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. Francis Place, a campaigner for the working class, agreed that "the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford". Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on William Ewart MP and Joseph Brotherton MP, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a d for the establishment of museums". This became the Museums Act 1845.
1849 select committee
The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. A paper entitled "A statistical view of the principal public libraries in Europe and the United States" by Edward Edwards, an assistant at the British Museum Library, came to Ewart's attention and Edwards became a key witness to the select committee. Edwards was "a self taught former bricklayer ... passionately convinced of the value and significance of libraries". The select committee of 1849 produced a report in which Edwards and Ewart ensured that "no stone was left unturned" in proving their case that existing public library provision was inadequate and that provision in other countries was far superior. The select committee reported that "while we learn that, more than half a century ago, the first step taken by a foreign writer was to consult a public library on the subject of his studies or composition; we find that no such auxiliary was at the service of the British intellect". The report also argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits, the same argument as was made by James Silk Buckingham fifteen years earlier. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the committee made certain proposals, including:
public use of university libraries
improved public access to the British Museum Library
duplicate books from the British Museum Library collection to be redistributed to local libraries
In order to achieve such ends, the committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries. However, it was not thought necessary to subsidise stock provision for the libraries so the levy was to be used to provide buildings, furnishings and staff salaries. The authors of the report believed that donations from members of the public would be more than adequate to stock the new libraries.
Public Libraries Act 1850
The 1850 Act was much more contentious than the Museums Act 1845. The major arguments against the Bill included:
Although the boroughs were represented by elected bodies, many people argued that the Act enforced taxation without consent.
There was opposition to the Act simply on the grounds that founding and maintaining the new libraries would mean an increase in taxation at all, consensual or otherwise.
Concerns were expressed that it would infringe on private enterprise and the existing library provision such as mechanics' institutes.
Access to certain publications would neither promote civil society nor act as a form of social control, and libraries would instead become sites of social agitation. This issue was linked to the common concern that extending education to the lower orders of society would lead to libraries becoming working class "lecture halls" "which would give rise to an unhealthy agitation".
Others felt that there were more pressing concerns, and wondered about the necessity for a library when literacy levels were so low.
In contrast many people favoured it, provided there was a cap on the level of taxation, on the grounds that:
Public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, not just those who were wealthy enough to afford their own private libraries and collections.
The greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower crime rates.
In order to get the Bill passed through Parliament, a number of concessions had to be made to its original content. The compromises made included limiting the Act to boroughs with populations of more than 10,000 where at least two-thirds of local ratepayers had to vote in favour of provision in a local referendum. The Bill would repeal the Museums Act 1845 and so, in order to continue funding museums of arts and science as well as the new free libraries, local rates could be increased, but by no more than d per £1. As stated in the Bill however, it was only permitted to spend this levy on library and museum buildings and staff but not on books and other stock.
Scottish provision
The Public Libraries Act 1850 initially applied only to England and Wales, but it was extended to Scotland in 1853 and there was a further Act, the Public Libraries (Scotland) Act, the following year when library authorities were granted the right to raise the rate by 1d. and to spend money on books, maps and specimens as well as on library and museum buildings. In addition to this, it was no longer necessary for there to be a poll of ratepayers for the Act to be adopted and uptake was instead authorised by a two-thirds majority at a public meeting of those who possessed or occupied a house of £10 annual value. This referred to homes that might reasonably be expected to have a net annual rental value of £10 a year or more. However, a poll could still be requested by any five voters present.
In 1855, similar amendments were introduced in England and Wales in a more wide-ranging Act. This included provision for the 1d rate and the authority to buy books, newspapers, maps and specimens. It also contained the amendment that had already been made in Scotland, that of the two-thirds majority at a public meeting of ratepayers.
Further legislation
The 1850 Act was noteworthy because it established the principle of free public libraries, but in practice it was unsatisfactory. It placed many limitations on the type of councils that could adopt it, the amount of money that the boroughs were permitted to spend and the ways in which this money could be spent. Efforts were later made to develop the Act further and remove many of these restrictions.
In 1855, the maximum rate that boroughs could charge to fund libraries was increased to 1d. Like the 1850 Act, this Bill had to be guided through the House of Commons by William Ewart. It met with a great deal of opposition and Ewart was obliged to abandon a proposal to enable municipal boroughs to adopt it by simple resolution of the town council.
There was some confusion regarding the provision of public libraries outside corporate towns, that is those towns incorporated by legal enactment and entitled to pass by-laws and use a common seal. This resulted in difficulties in extending public library provision to rural areas. The 1855 Act tried to resolve these difficulties by stating that a library authority could be a borough council, an improvement board or commission, a parish vestry or group of vestries, provided they covered a minimum population of 5,000. Since the 18th century, improvement boards had been established in many urban areas to take responsibility for paving, lighting and cleaning of streets, but over time their functions became wider in scope. From 1835 onwards, their responsibilities were assumed by elected town councils in the reformed boroughs but they continued in the urban areas outside the boroughs. Becoming a public library authority was another extension of their authority.
In 1866, an amending Act was passed which eliminated entirely the population limit and replaced the two-thirds majority previously required for adoption with a simple majority. It also allowed neighbouring parishes to combine with an existing or potential library authority. This Act covered Scotland, England and Wales and in 1867 another Act was passed in Scotland to amend and consolidate it, which established a form of library committee composed of a maximum of twenty members, of which half were to be members of the council and the other half to be selected by the council from householders.
Legacy
The Public Library Acts of 1855 and 1866 were the last to be advanced by William Ewart, who retired in 1868. He had made great efforts to promote the public library system in Great Britain and perhaps his greatest achievement was the complete elimination of the population limits, as it allowed even very small towns or parishes to set up a public library. It was later found that this could present a problem, as many public libraries were established by library authorities that did not in fact have enough money to run a library satisfactorily.
Despite the rise in the level of tax public libraries could levy, it was still very difficult for boroughs to raise enough capital to fund new libraries. The growth of the public library movement in the wake of the 1850 Act relied heavily on the donations of philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie, John Passmore Edwards and Henry Tate.

Freedom of testation is the power of a person to make a will and testament specifying whatever heirs they please. It is historically associated with English common law, and contrasted with forced heirship, where part or all of the estate is automatically inherited by the next of kin. Opponents of absolute freedom of testation have pointed to the possibility of a widow or orphan being left destitute while property of a spouse or parent is bequeathed to others. Some opponents of inheritance tax have characterized it as an abrogation of freedom of testation.
History
After the Norman conquest of England, the Church succeeded in allowing a person to leave part of his property to the church to fund its activities.
In the law of the Republic of Ireland, the Succession Act 1965 reduces freedom of testation by guaranteeing provision for the spouse and children of the deceased.

Iraqis in the United Arab Emirates have a population exceeding 100,000, closer estimates report a total of 150,000 Iraqis in the Emirates. Since its independence, Iraqis have contributed in the development of the UAE, as engineers, politicians and in other fields. Most notably Adnan Pachachi who was appointed as Minister of State in the first Government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Pachachi is known for his role in submitting the UAE's application for membership in the United Nations. In a meeting with Prime Minister of Iraq, Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan stated that "Iraqis have contributed in building the UAE, and there are many of them who worked, built, developed and helped build the Emirates, and we mention this credit to them, whether engineers, doctors, or even politicians and others. There are still many Iraqis living in the UAE, and they are credited.”
The Iraqi people tend to be spread out over various emirates of the country, with areas of high concentration being Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
Background
Early migration of Iraqi people to the Emirates began after Abdul Salam Arif's 1968 Arab nationalist revolution in Baghdad which resulted in a high influx of Iraqis moving their businesses to Dubai and continued to do so during the 1970s, as well as throughout the Iran–Iraq War, the first Gulf war and the further ongoing civil unrest in Iraq due to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The majority of Iraqi expatriates that fled to the UAE are educated and affluent peoples who are now active in Emirati society, from being engineers to teachers and jewellers, as well as being involved in business and the media as presenters and news anchors.
Economic contributions
There are 500 Iraqi companies operating in the Jebel Ali Free Zone alone, an economic hub located in Jebel Ali, a city in Dubai.

Content
Band bassist Jett Beres was quoted as saying "The five years since our last record has been anything but a straight and clear path. After making records together for over 20 years, we found ourselves struggling to find The Sound; a body of work that would honestly represent who each of us were as a band and as individuals. The music that was created was our 'lighter in the dark.' The songs that form this record slowly began to illuminate a clarity of direction and creativity for us. In choosing a record title, this lyric from the song 'Something to Believe In' became the clear choice to represent our journey, our struggles, and ultimately our deliverance."

The Jersey Eastern Railway was a standard gauge railway that began operations on 6 August 1873 in Jersey. The line closed on 21 June 1929. It is not to be confused with the Jersey Railway.
History
The Loi pour l'établissement d'un Chemin de Fer entre la Ville de St.-Hélier et Gorey was approved on 16 March 1871 (confirmed by Order in Council 19 March 1872), with 68 articles of the projet in the name of the Jersey Eastern Railway Company Limited. The law (repealed by the Statute Law Revision (No. 3) (Jersey) Law, 1966) authorised the railway from Snow Hill in St Helier, to Gorey and from there to St Catherine's Bay in St Martin, although the latter route was never begun. There was no mention of gauge. Article 54 of the project was significant in stating that any disagreement with property owners must be resolved by the Royal Court for consideration and decision, and the claimant could not cause work to cease by raising the clameur de haro (as had happened with the Jersey Railway construction).
On 15 May 1871, the committee appointed by the States met to consider objections by landowners; the majority were satisfied that they had received fair compensation.
The first turf was dug by Mrs Mourant, wife of Edward Mourant, the chairman of the Board of Directors, at a private ceremony on 17 September 1872. The line was opened on 6 August 1873, with a train of six carriages taking the States Members and their wives along the track to Grouville Station in 15 minutes.
The official opening of Gorey station was on 25 May 1891, to coincide with Queen Victoria's birthday. The journey of just over six miles from St Helier cost 9d (old pence) first class return, 6d second class return.
In 1923 the Jersey Motor Transport Company started a bus service carrying passengers all over the Island. The Jersey Eastern Railway tried to counter the fierce competition by running their own bus service in 1926, but this was not much of a success, and declining profits led to termination of both the bus and train services on 21 June 1929. The company itself was liquidated in 1932.
Most of the land was sold to adjacent landowners, but part of the route can be seen near Fauvic (at the southeastern tip of the island), where it has been preserved as a footpath.
The Jersey Eastern Railway Terminus Hotel at Snow Hill remains, and is on the Register of Historic Buildings.
Route
The line began at Saint Helier, with intermediate stations located at Georgetown, Samarès, Le Hocq, Pontac, La Rocque and Fauvic, with the eastern terminus in Grouville, originally opposite the Wimbledon Hotel, later extended to Gorey and then to Gorey Pier.
Locomotives
North Western 2-4-0T Built by Sharp Stewart in 1870, (Works No. 2047). Locomotive was purchased from the Jersey Railway in 1878 and was withdrawn in 1898 and eventually sold to a Scottish Quarry.
Messrs. Kitson & Co. of Leeds built all four of the following 0-4-2T engines:
Caesarea, 1872. (Works No. 1832)

The Uncommons is a board game cafe in New York City, New York, USA located at 230 Thompson Street in Greenwich Village.
Visitors can pay $5 per hour to stay and play games as long as they like, or can participate in any of the regular tournaments, including several a week for Magic: The Gathering. The cafe serves beverages and food. The location now features over 750 games in their library, and during weekends, "lines can snake out the door".
History
Opened in 2013 by founders Greg May, Jeff Cassin, and Henry Chang, The Uncommons occupies the space of the former Village Chess Shop. Funded in part by a successful Kickstarter campaign, The Uncommons is Manhattan's only board game cafe as of 2015 and has been featured on television shows, including NickMom and Take Me to Your Mother.
In an interview of Laura Marling, John Seabrook, for The New Yorker, wrote, "...the Uncommons is the kind of laid-back, N.Y.U.-student-heavy place where you'd expect to hear a song by the twenty-five-year-old British singer-songwriter, a folkie who, with her new album, "Short Movie", has turned her hand to rock. But it was unusual to have Laura Marling walk into the café a few minutes later." Marling adds, "I do think that board games are a great way of gauging someone's personality".

Süleyman of Karaman (Seyfeddin Süleyman) was a bey of the Karaman Beylik, a Turkish principality in Anatolia in the 14th century.
His father was Halil Bey. He served as the governor of Ermenek during his uncle Musa Bey's reign. Upon the death of Musa in 1356, he became the bey of Karaman. He appointed his brother Alaattin Ali Bey as the governor of Ermenek. His brother also served as a commander during the wars. According to the contemporary Turkish writer Şikari, after Ali defeated a coalition of forces, the losers collaborated with Mehmet, the ruler of the neighbouring beylik of Eretna, against Süleyman. In 1361 while he was on his way to a burial service of one of his old soldiers, he was assassinated.
His tomb is in Konya, next to the tomb of the mother of Mevlana (Rumi).

The DAR 3 Garvan ('Raven' or 'Laz-3') was a 1930s Bulgarian single-engine, multipurpose reconnaissance and auxiliary aircraft.
Design and development
The aircraft was a multipurpose close air support biplane developed by the Drjavna Aeroplane Rаbotilnitsa. It was intended to be a short-range reconnaissance/light bomber. The first prototype was powered by a 400 hp (298 kW) Lorraine-Dietrich 12D engine. During its early stages, the DAR 3(I) prototype suffered various modifications. It's maiden flight occurred in 1927 and it was delivered in 1928. In 1930 it was fitted with a Gnome et Rhône Jupiter 9Akx radial engine. The second prototype came shortly after: the first prototype's rudder and fin were enlarged and its undercarriage was revised. A second aircraft known as the DAR 3(I bis.), refereed to as the third prototype, was built. It featured an American Wright Cyclone engine and triangular pointed fin and was delivered in 1929.
Operational history
During the 1930s and 1940s, the DAR 3 was used for reconnaissance, army co-operation, liaison and continuation training. The DAR 3 also saw action over the Balkans in 1944. After the crash of two Garvan-III aircraft, the Bulgarian Air Force handed the 10 remaining planes to the Yugoslavian Air Force.

Room and pillar or pillar and stall is a variant of breast stoping. It is a mining system in which the mined material is extracted across a horizontal plane, creating horizontal arrays of rooms and pillars. To do this, "rooms" of ore are dug out while "pillars" of untouched material are left to support the roof overburden. Calculating the size, shape, and position of pillars is a complicated procedure, and is an area of active research. The technique is usually used for relatively flat-lying deposits, such as those that follow a particular stratum. Room and pillar mining can be advantageous because it reduces the risk of surface subsidence compared to other underground mining techniques. It is also advantageous because it can be mechanized, and is relatively simple. However, because significant portions of ore may have to be left behind, recovery and profits can be low. Room and pillar mining was one of the earliest methods used, although with significantly more man-power.
The room and pillar system is used in mining coal, gypsum, iron, and uranium ores, particularly when found as manto or blanket deposits, stone and aggregates, talc, soda ash, and potash. It has been used worldwide from the Czech Republic to China to the US.
Process
Stage 1—exploration and development
Planning for the development of room and pillar mines operates in much the same way as other mining methods, and begins with establishing ownership of the mine. Following this, the geology of the mine must be analysed, as this will determine factors like the lifespan of the mine, the production requirements, and the cost to develop and maintain.
Next, mine layout should be determined, as factors like ventilation, electrical power, and haulage of the ore must be considered in cost analysis. Due to the non-homogeneous nature of mineral deposits typically mined by room and pillar, mine layout must be mapped very carefully. It is desirable to keep the size and shape of rooms and pillars consistent, but some mines strayed from this formula due to lack of planning and deposit characteristics. Mine layout includes the size of rooms and pillars in the mines, but also includes factors like the number and type of entries, roof height, ventilation, and cut sequence.
Mine layout
Room and pillar mines are developed on a grid basis except where geological features such as faults require the regular pattern to be modified. The size of the pillars is determined by calculation. The load-bearing capacity of the material above and below the material being mined and the capacity of the mined material will determine the pillar size.
Random mine layout makes ventilation planning difficult, and if the pillars are too small, there is the risk of pillar failure. In coal mines, pillar failures are known as squeezes because the roof squeezes down, crushing the pillars. Once one pillar fails, the weight on the adjacent pillars increases, and the result is a chain reaction of pillar failures. Once started, such chain reactions can be extremely difficult to stop, even if they spread slowly. To prevent this from happening, the mine is divided up into areas or panels. Pillars known as barrier pillars separate the panels. The barrier pillars are significantly larger than the "panel" pillars and are sized to allow them to support a significant part of the panel and prevent progressive collapse of the mine in the event of failure of the panel pillars.
Stage 2—mining
Traditionally, the act of mining consists of three steps. First, the deposit is "undercut", where a slot is cut as deep as possible along the bottom of a section of ore. This undercut allows for a manageable pile of rock in later stages. The second step was the drilling and blasting of the section. This creates a pile of ore that is loaded and hauled out of the mine—the final step of the mining process. More modern room and pillar mines use a more "continuous" method, that uses machinery to simultaneously grind off rock and move it to the surface.
Other processes, such as backfill, where discarded tailings are unloaded into mined-out areas, can be used, but are not required. Retreat mining (below) is an example of a process like this.
Retreat mining
Retreat mining is often the final stage of room and pillar mining. Once a deposit has been exhausted using this method, the pillars that were left behind initially are removed, or "pulled", retreating back towards the mine's entrance. After the pillars are removed, the roof (or back) is allowed to collapse behind the mining area. Pillar removal must occur in a very precise order to reduce the risks to workers, owing to the high stresses placed on the remaining pillars by the abutment stresses of the caving ground.
Retreat mining is a particularly dangerous form of mining. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), pillar recovery mining has been historically responsible for 25% of American coal mining deaths caused by failures of the roof or walls, even though it represents only 10% of the coal mining industry. Retreat mining cannot be used in areas where subsidence is not acceptable, reducing profitability.
Sometimes retreat mining is not used and the underground space is repurposed as climate controlled storage or office space instead.
Stage 3—maintenance and remediation
Many room and pillar mines have been abandoned for as long as 100 years. This drastically increases the risk of subsidence unless properly maintained, however, maintenance does not often occur.
Mention of "environmental stewardship" is often mentioned by mining companies, but no examples of how this is being done can be found.
History
Room and pillar mining is one of the oldest mining methods. Early room and pillar mines were developed more or less at random, with pillar sizes determined empirically and headings driven in whichever direction was convenient.
Room and pillar mining was in use throughout Europe as early as the 13th century, and the United States since the late 18th century. It is still in use throughout the US, but has slowed or stopped entirely in parts of Europe.
Coal mining in the United States has nearly always operated with a room and pillar layout, although originally operated with significantly more man-power.
Room and pillar mining of gypsum was used in Iowa beginning in 1892, and was phased out of use in 1927 due to low recovery and development of technologies that made surface mining more practical, safe, and cost effective. More recently, the U.S. Gypsum Sperry mine, near Mediapolis, Iowa, opened in 1961. This room-and-pillar mine, below the surface, has square pillars on a side separating rooms of the same width in a gypsum bed about thick.
Many salt mines use room-and-pillar layouts. The Sifto salt mine in Goderich, Ontario, the largest in the world, was opened in 1959. It taps a salt bed thick below the surface, mostly under Lake Huron. The Cargill salt mine below the surface, mostly under Lake Erie at Cleveland, Ohio is similar.
Modern use
Modern room and pillar mines can be few and far between. This is due to many factors, including the dangers to miners associated with subsidence, increasing use of other methods with more mechanization, and the decreasing cost of surface mining.
Advantages
Room and pillar mining is not particularly dependent on the depth of the deposit. At particularly deep depths, room and pillar mining can be more cost effective compared to strip mining due to the fact that significantly less overburden needs to be removed. This means that today, room and pillar mining is mostly used for high grade, but small, deep deposits.
Disadvantages
Due to a recovery rate as low as 40% in some cases, room and pillar mining cannot compete in terms of profitability with many modern, more mechanized types of mining such as longwall or surface mining.
Abandoned mines have a tendency to collapse. In remote areas, collapses can be dangerous to wildlife, but subsidence of abandoned mines can be hazardous to infrastructure above and nearby.

Humboldt's Gift is a 1975 novel by Canadian-American author Saul Bellow. It won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and contributed to Bellow's winning the Nobel Prize in Literature the same year.
Plot
The novel, which Bellow initially intended to be a short story, is a roman à clef about Bellow's friendship with the poet Delmore Schwartz. It explores the changing relationship of art and power in a materialist America. This theme is addressed through the contrasting careers of two writers, Von Humboldt Fleisher (to some degree a version of Schwartz) and his protégé Charlie Citrine (to some degree a version of Bellow himself). Fleisher yearns to lift American society through art, but dies a failure. By contrast, Charlie Citrine makes a lot of money through his writing, especially from a Broadway play and a movie about a character named Von Trenck – a character modeled after Fleisher.
Another notable character in the book is Rinaldo Cantabile, a wannabe Chicago gangster, who tries to bully Citrine into being friends. Because his career advice to Citrine is commercially fixated, it is directly opposed to advice from Citrine's former mentor, Humboldt Fleisher, who prioritizes artistic integrity.
Reception
Humboldt's Gift won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Bellow's first after three previous works were finalists. In the novel Humboldt says, and Citrine agrees, that the prize is "a dummy newspaper publicity award given by crooks and illiterates". When asked about the description after winning the prize, Bellow laughed and said that he would accept the award "in dignified silence".
Some critics, including Malcolm Bradbury, see the novel as a commentary on the increasing commodification of culture in mid-century America. Throughout much of the book, Bellow also analyzes, through the voice of Citrine, his thoughts on spirituality, poetry, and success in America.
Alvin Kernan, in his 1982 book The Imaginary Library, included a chapter on Humboldt's Gift, arguing that the novel is representative of the declining relevance of the Romantic conception of literature to contemporary life.

Forndom is the stage name of Swedish multi-instrumentalist and Nordic folk musician Ludvig Swärd. He has released three albums: 2020's Faþir, 2016's Dauðra Dura, and 2015's Flykt. The name Forndom is a combination of the Old Norse word fordom, meaning 'of old', and the modern Swedish word forn, which means 'ancient'. Forndom's sound has been compared to that of Wardruna, as well as other bands in the Nordic folk scene.
History and Music
Prior to starting Forndom, Swärd ran an amateur photography blog on the social media platform Tumblr. His first release, Flykt, was made to be an accompaniment to his photos. This first album was recorded entirely using virtual instruments through a DAW. However, Forndom's next release Dauðra Dura was recorded with real instrumentation played by Swärd. These included traditional Norse instruments such as the Tagelharpa, the Näverlur and a Vevlira (or Hurdy-Gurdy).
Dauðra Dura, meaning Doors of Death in Old Norse, was released via the record label Nordvis (also home to progressive black metal band Panopticon) in 2016. Reviewers called it a 'mesmerisingly dark aural adventure', 'a strong addition to the Nordic folk musical landscape' and 'musically compelling'.
Forndom's next album Faþir was released on April 3, 2020, also via the Nordvis label. Early reviewers praised the 'intensity of feeling' and noted the 'deeply sacred dimension' to the music.

This Is My Hand is the fourth studio album from the American rock group My Brightest Diamond.
Content
The ten-track album was released on translucent red and black vinyl, compact disc, and digital download with Asthmatic Kitty, in the UK on 15 September 2014 and in the US on 16 September 2014. It was produced by Zac Rae and Shara Worden, and mixed and mastered by S. Husky Hoskulds. Album layout and design is by DM Stith, and the cover photograph is by Bernd Preiml. This Is My Hand is described as percussive art-pop that incorporates elements of chamber pop and cabaret, with haunting vocals and opera theatrics. Worden wrote the album imagining a tribe of people gathered around a fire, who were making music together, telling stories and hearing stories from shaman, and it explores themes of self-acceptance, sensuality, and community. She was also reading Daniel Levitin's book The World in Six Songs, and drew inspiration from Jared Diamond's book on human evolution, The Third Chimpanzee, and Matthew Barney and Jonathan Bepler's operatic and experimental film, River of Fundament, which Worden recorded for, while she was writing This Is My Hand. The album draws comparison to the music of St. Vincent, These New Puritans, and the Sufjan Steven's album Age of Adz.
The final song "Apparition" contains lyrics from French poet Stéphane Mallarmé's poem "Apparition," with Worden describing the adapted story as being about a child, who is visited and enraptured by a ghost with a hat made of light. The song "Pressure" was released as a single on 2 September 2014. The music video for "Lover/Killer" was directed by Jean-Paul Frenay and released on 27 November 2014. It features footage of a man held at gunpoint, who is blinded by a mysterious creature, and a woman who is drowned. The man fires the gun and emerges out of the water to greet himself, and the woman awakes and leaves the man behind. Frenay explains in an interview with Flood, that he "fell in love with the hypnotic mood of the song and the very suggestive and abstract lyrics. This music video is a metaphor of the rupture between the past and future, the idea of leaving something/some part of you behind to move forward, to be replaced by a new version of you."
Reception
A review in Pitchfork says "in a frustrating bit of organization, This Is My Hands most memorable moments are front loaded in its opening five songs[,] an invigorating progression of Worden's sonic palette, [and] the album winds down with a string of slower, ethereal oddities that blunt the concentrated pandemonium of its earlier tracks." A mixed review by Consequence of Sound notes that the album "prevails as a strong hallmark for Worden's diverse background, exacting her signature theatrical drama and indie rock influences. The only lapse is its inability to explore – which, in going by her unconventional background, Worden seems more than capable of doing." The Guardian says This Is My Hand remains "furiously artsy[,] with intense songs, sung with a crystalline elasticity, hav[ing] located the mojo previously absent from My Brightest Diamond's art."
A positive review from NME calls the song "Lover Killer" "entic[ing] with ghostly vocals until a brassy beat snaps the listener in half with its psychedelic stomp," summarizing that This Is My Hand "should see her join [...] the US experimental pop pantheon." For the single "Pressure," Stereogum writes that it is filled "with an army of percussive sounds from big drums to twinkling bells along with shrieking brass and crushing synths, it's a huge production, but it all sounds small compared to Worden's operatic voice."
On the album instrumentation, Drowned in Sound describes them as "lush, dense and layered - and the arrangement of it shows how skilled of an arranger Worden must be," adding the "joyful woodwind trills and arpeggios that pepper the album are straight out of Illinoise while the haunting, expressive synthesizer work are reminiscent of [..] The Age of Adz." NPR says the albums finds Worden "wielding instruments like a series of tools, each with a discrete purpose in the construction of an abstract, heterogeneous galaxy." The album peaked on the Billboard charts on 4 October 2014, at No. 50.

Varzahan (, or Varzahan Kiliseleri), was an Armenian church founded in the 12th century near village Uğrak (formerly Varzahan), 10 km northwest of Bayburt, in eastern Turkey.
History
Situated in a settlement called Varzahan in Upper Armenia province of Historical Armenia's northern part. Varzahan was a large Armenian settlement in a 5.7 miles northwest to the Baberd city ( now Bayburt ) of a northernmost district of Upper Armenia called Sper. Most of its population was massacred by Turks during the 18th century. The monastery was damaged in the same period. The archaeologist Austin Henry Layard has described this place in 1849 while travelling from Trebizond to Mosul. Austin Henry Layard said: ---The only place of any interest, passed during our ride, was a small Armenian village, the remains of a larger, with the ruins of three early Christian churches, or Baptisteries.---

Macaria abydata, commonly known as the dot-lined angle, is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is native from northern Argentina to the Caribbean and southern United States (southern states from Arizona to Florida, regularly wandering north to Colorado, Kentucky and other more northern states). It has been introduced to the Pacific and has spread rapidly since. The first introduction occurred in Hawaii in 1970 (recorded from all the main islands in 1984). Further spread occurred as follows:
1975: Yap, central Micronesia
1976: Bonin Islands (Chichi-jima, Haha-jima)
1977: Saipan, central Micronesia (1985)
1980: Okinawa Island
1983: Taiwan
1985: Guam, central Micronesia (1985) Sulawesi (1986)
1986: Tonga (1985), Fiji (1985), Miyako Islands (Miyako-jima), Luzon, the Philippines (1985)
1987: New Caledonia (1985), Sabah, Malaysia
1988: western Samoa (1985)
1992: Hong Kong
The wingspan is .
The phrase "dot-lined" comes from the evidence of small dots along the postmedial and sometimes median line of both forewing and hindwing(anterior of the marginal band).
Recorded host plants for larvae in its natural range are Vachellia farnesiana, Cassia, Sesbania, Parkinsonia aculeata and Glycine max. Larvae have been observed on Acacia koa and introduced Lysiloma latisiliquum and Litchi chinensis in Hawaii. In the Indo-Australian tropics it has been reared from Leucaena and Mimosa diplotricha.

Veronica May Volkersz ( Innes; 1917–2000) was a British aviator and beauty queen. She flew for the RAF's Air Transport Auxiliary in the Second World War and was the first British woman to fly an operational jet fighter when she ferried a Meteor from the Gloster factory to RAF Moreton Valence on 15 September 1945.
Early life
Veronica May Innes was born in Chesterton, Cambridge, on 17 April 1917. Her father was G. V. d'A. Innes – a professional soldier who rose to the rank of Major. When he served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers in India, she spent several summers in the Himalayan city of Srinigar, which she much preferred to her boarding school life in England.
In 1934, she participated in a grand pageant at Runnymede which was organised by Gwen Lally to celebrate English democracy, the Magna Carta and to raise money for charity. This lasted for eight days and she was the Queen of Beauty on four of those days, taking the role of the Fair Maid of Kent.
She was an enthusiastic horse rider and car driver, going hunting and racing an open-topped Aston Martin sports car. She discovered aviation at Brooklands in 1938 and then learnt to fly with the Civil Air Guard, going solo at Cambridge airfield on 13 February 1939. This then caused headlines in the local press, "Beauty Queen Joins Civil Air Guard".
Second World War
In the summer of 1939, she encountered preparations for war while flying out of Woodley Aerodrome on her first solo cross-country flight. These were barrage balloons which were being tested at RAF Cardington. She avoided these but then wind and mist caused her to become lost. She landed at a small airfield which proved to be RAF Wyton. She was then able to get her bearings and followed a railway line to the destination of Cambridge.
The Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) was formed in 1939 and eight women were first allowed to fly for this at the start of 1940. Veronica was driving ambulances for the Voluntary Aid Detachment while living in London with her father who was then working for MI5. She wrote to ATA as soon as she saw the coverage in the press but was not accepted immediately as she had not logged enough flying hours. She persisted and was given a trial at Hatfield Aerodrome in 1940. She performed well but was still not accepted until March 1941, when she started training at Hatfield with other new recruits such as Honor Pitman. After a month of training, she passed a flying test at the ATA HQ of White Waltham and was commissioned as a second officer.
She had been flying Tiger Moths but then converted to more powerful aircraft. This started with the Hawker Audax in which she found that she needed a cushion to reach the controls. She then mastered the Hawker Hind, the North American Harvard and the Fairey Battle light bomber. Finally, she completed the conversion course by flying the Hawker Hurricane – "it's like an Audax with about five hundred times more guts", she told a fellow trainee.
She ferried Hurricanes while still new to the type. In late 1941, she was ferrying a Hurricane to Squires Gate Airport when fog caused a near miss with another aircraft. The evasive manoeuvre put the Hurricane into a dive and it was so difficult to pull out in time that the aircraft brought down the airfield's telegraph wires. New Hurricanes were generally quite difficult with especially stiff undercarriages and unreliable brakes. In the cold January 1942, she was ferrying a Hurricane to Ratcliffe Aerodrome when the windscreen iced up. She had to open the canopy to the icy blizzard to make out the runway and so managed to land it. But while taxiing, the wind caught the plane and flipped it forward onto its nose. She survived but the Accidents Committee found this to be her fault.
In April 1942, she converted to fly light twin-engined planes, starting with the comparatively sedate Airspeed Oxford. Conversion to heavy twins like the Wellington then followed but she didn't like these. "It's like flying around in a pair of railway carriages", she complained, "No finesse required whatsoever." She needed four cushions to fly the Wellington, and had to lie almost flat on her back.
In October 1942, she was posted to Hamble. She then appeared in a film about the ATA shot by the Crown Film Unit at Pinewood Studios. In 1943, she did the Class 4 Plus conversion, which allowed her to fly the Hudson and Mosquito. She was then allowed to fly the powerful Typhoon too. She enjoyed this type, cruising at 300 mph, and delivered about a hundred of them.
In March 1944, she was promoted to Flight Captain. At the end of the war, she was assigned to an invasion pool of pilots at White Waltham. She was still ferrying new aircraft and was the first woman to fly an operational jet fighter – a Gloster Meteor which she took to RAF Moreton Valence. The jets were simpler to operate than a variable-pitch propeller but intense when at the full throttle of 16,500 rpm – "an almighty kick in the pants".
Personal life
In June 1942, she became engaged to Gerard Volkersz – a flying officer in the Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service, who served in the Fleet Air Arm after the fall of the Netherlands. They married at Chelsea Register Office and, in 1947, she gave birth to a son but he was stillborn. Her marriage then broke up and she did not remarry. Instead, she pursued a career in aviation, working as a freelance pilot. One contract in 1948 was to fly Tempest fighters from Langley to Pakistan – a distance of about five thousand miles.

Advanced Lawnmower Simulator is a 1988 simulation game for the ZX Spectrum. The player is tasked with mowing lawns in exchange for rewards.
The game was developed as an April Fools' joke by Your Sinclair, who published a joke review lauding it, and released the game on a cover tape. Several letters about the game appeared in the magazine following release, and it was revealed as an April Fools' prank in August 1990. The game has been noted as extremely unusual by IGN and Geek.com. It has also received a cult following, has received remakes, and has inspired other games with similar titles.
Gameplay
The player is presented with a choice of six lawnmowers, five of which are inoperative and cannot be used. Once the only operative lawnmower has been picked, the player then uses it to mow a lawn. There is only one key ("M"), and pressing it mows one square of lawn. After a lawn is completely mowed, the player is rewarded if it was done well enough. All lawns are identical.
After a few lawns have been mowed, the player gets killed automatically (according to Your Sinclair, the mower "hits a rock and blows up") and the game starts over.
Development and release
Advanced Lawnmower Simulator was first conceived as a prank in the April 1988 issue of Your Sinclair. The piece claimed the player takes on the role of a Youth Training Scheme junior gardener with a lawnmower, a small toolbox, and a can of petrol, and would be able to upgrade their equipment, including additional tools, more cans of petrol and more powerful "grassware". It also claimed that lawns get larger as the game progresses, have hidden traps such as stones, coat-hangers, and duck-ponds, and later levels would be rose gardens. The supposed developer and publisher Gardensoft were introduced as "a brand-new publishing house that looks set to carve quite a niche for itself in the simulations market", and the piece claimed that they were going to release more games in the coming months, including a spring-cleaning game, a washing-up simulator (including a drying-up simulator), and a laundrette simulator in which players supposedly have to clean bags of various colours and materials. It was also stated that Advanced Lawnmower Simulator is "ACE!" and a "Guaranteed number one!", and would cost £14.95. It was also awarded a nine out of ten and given the magazine's MEGAGAME accolade. An advertisement, which described the game as "The most advanced domestic chore simulation yet to hit the home micro!" and claimed a release date of 1 April and that it would be available for purchase in garden centres, appeared in the same issue. The game was coded by Your Sinclair writer Duncan Macdonald, and released on a cover tape in the next issue. The game parodied Codemasters' habit of including the word "simulator" in its game titles.
Your Sinclair revealed the review and game to be an April Fools' joke in August 1990 (after a series of letters about the game were supposedly posted to the magazine). The issue also claimed (with screenshots) there are three sequels to the game: one written by Rodney Sproston in which "alien grass has invaded the moon", Advanced Lawenmower Simulator III, in which the player inadvertently enters a nightmare whose only escape from is by mowing through a "dream hole", and ALS Part Four - The Revenge Of Mow, in which the player has to collect money after it falls out of their pocket after purchasing a new mower. The piece finished with the words "Utter crap."
Reception
In 2008, Retro Gamer jokingly stated that Advanced Lawnmower Simulator "has been hailed as THE best game on the Spectrum", and made jocular judgements on the gameplay and graphics as "Outstanding" and "Excellent" respectively, and of the game as "a truly special experience".
Advanced Lawnmower Simulator appears on an IGN list of "Video Games You Won't Believe Somebody Made", and a Geek.com list of "Weirdest Simulation Games of All Time". Vice described the prank as "one of the strangest incidents in mainstream publishing."
Legacy
Advanced Lawnmower Simulator has received a cult following, and many remakes have been made. The game also inspired some homebrewed games whose titles include the word "simulator". It has been ported to the Amstrad CPC and Amiga.

was a Japanese spy in Hawaii before the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
Early career
A 1933 graduate of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima (graduating at the top of his class), Yoshikawa served briefly at sea aboard the armored cruiser Asama as well as submarines. He had begun training as a naval pilot near the end of 1934 when a severe stomach ailment prevented him from completing his training. He was subsequently discharged from the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1936. As a result, he briefly contemplated suicide.
A year later he began a career in Naval intelligence, being assigned to Navy Headquarters in Tokyo. He became an expert in the U.S. Navy, perusing every source he could possibly get his hands on. While on intelligence duty he intercepted a shortwave radio message in plain English that 17 troop transports were en route to England, having cleared the port of Freetown, Sierra Leone. He passed this information to the German Embassy, and many of the ships were destroyed as a result. Yoshikawa subsequently received a personal letter of thanks from Adolf Hitler. In 1940 he became a junior diplomat after passing the Foreign Ministry English examinations.
A spy in Hawaii
Because of his expertise on the U.S. Navy, Yoshikawa was sent to Hawaii posing as a vice-consul named Tadashi Morimura (森村 正 Morimura Tadashi), arriving on March 27, 1941, with Nagao Kita (喜多 長雄 Kita Nagao), the new Japanese Consul-General aboard the liner Nitta Maru. He rented a second-story apartment that overlooked Pearl Harbor and would often wander around the island of Oahu, taking notes on fleet movements and security measures. He rented small airplanes at John Rodgers Airport and flew around, observing U.S. installations; he also dove under the harbor using a hollow reed as a breathing device. He gathered information by taking the Navy's own harbor tugboat and listening to local gossip. He worked closely with German Abwehr agent Bernard Kuehn, as well as another former Etajima graduate, Kokichi Seki (関 興吉 Seki Kō'kichi), an untrained spy who served as the consulate's treasurer.
According to Yoshikawa, although some 160,000 persons of Japanese ancestry lived in Hawaii at that time, he never tried to make use of this resource in his espionage activities. He and Seki agreed that, while Hawaii should be the "easiest place" to carry out such work in view of the large Japanese population, both looked upon the locals with disdain. "[T]hose men of influence and character who might have assisted me in my secret mission were unanimously uncooperative...."
Although he had no knowledge of a planned attack on Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Yoshikawa assumed that the intelligence would help prepare for such an eventuality and worked tirelessly to that end. His reports were transmitted by the Japanese consulate in PURPLE code to the Foreign Ministry, which passed them on to the Navy. Although the code had been broken by Allied codebreakers and messages to and from Tokyo were intercepted and decrypted, communications between Tokyo and the consulate were considered low-priority because they contained so many messages that were entirely commercial in nature. However, one such message addressed to Kita (but actually to Yoshikawa) and sent on September 24, 1941, should have received more attention. It divided Pearl Harbor into five distinct zones and requested that the location and number of warships be indicated on a "plot" (i.e., grid) of the harbor. However, due to delays caused by staff shortages and other priorities the message was not decrypted and distributed until mid-October, and then dismissed as being of little consequence. However, it was the reports that he sent twice a week based on this request that enabled Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to finalize his plan for the attack.
When he heard the "East wind, rain" code phrase on the short wave radio bringing the news from Tokyo to signal that an attack against the United States was to proceed, Yoshikawa destroyed all evidence of his activities. When the FBI picked him up on the day of the attack, there was no incriminating evidence of his espionage. He eventually returned to Japan in August 1942 in a diplomat prisoner exchange. It was not known for some time that he was the chief Japanese agent in Hawaii.
Return to Japan and later life
Yoshikawa continued to work for naval intelligence during the remainder of the war. When the war ended and Japan was occupied by U.S. forces, he went into hiding (disguised as a Buddhist monk) for fear of being prosecuted for his role in the Pearl Harbor attack. He returned to his wife (whom he had married shortly after his return from the U.S.) when the occupation ended.
Yoshikawa never received official recognition of his services during the war. In 1955, he opened a candy business but it failed as word spread of his role in the war. The locals blamed Yoshikawa for the war. "They even blamed me for the atomic bomb," he declared in one interview. Penniless and jobless, he was supported by his wife for the rest of his life via her position selling insurance. "My wife alone shows me great respect," said the old former spy. "Every day she bows to me. She knows I am a man of history." He died in a nursing home.
Over the years, the mysterious spies of Pearl Harbor were always mentioned in passing in history books. While the Yoshikawa case was used to retroactively justify the decision to intern Japanese Americans, he claimed that he distrusted the Japanese-American community and that it was loyal to America over Japan.

Albert Weston Grant (April 14, 1856 – September 30, 1930) was an admiral of the United States Navy. He served during the Spanish–American War and was commander of Battleship Force 1, Atlantic Fleet, in World War I.
Biography
Grant was born on April 14, 1856, at East Benton, Maine. He grew up at Stevens Point, Wisconsin, with his pioneer family and won a competitive appointment to the United States Naval Academy, from which he graduated on June 20, 1877. Following service in , , , , and , he served ashore at the Norfolk Navy Yard, received torpedo training, and served briefly at the Naval War College.
Duty in , , , and preceded his return to Norfolk to supervise major repairs to Pensacola which entailed pioneer work in applying electricity to warships and then reported to . On May 9, 1893, his commission as a lieutenant reached him while he was serving in that gunboat. A tour in cruiser ended in the summer of 1894 when Grant was ordered back to the Naval Academy for duty as an instructor. Detached some three years later, he returned to sea in and served off the coast of Cuba in during the Spanish–American War.
Transferred to on September 8, 1898, Grant was serving in her when promoted to lieutenant commander on July 1, 1900, a month before orders sent him back to the Academy for two more years as an instructor. Three years of service in the Far East followed — as executive officer of and then as commanding officer of the patrol yacht — before he returned to Annapolis where he was promoted to commander and placed in charge of the Seamanship Department. During this assignment, he prepared a study of naval tactics, The School of the Ship, which became a standard textbook.
On July 22, 1907, Grant reported to the Naval War College for instruction and, upon completing the course in the autumn, assumed command of the , which was the fuel tender to the Great White Fleet's destroyer flotilla. Grant took the Arethusa around Cape Horn to the Pacific. Detached on the last day of March 1908, he embarked in as chief of staff to the Commander of the Atlantic Fleet. During that tour of duty, he was promoted to captain on July 1, 1909. He relinquished his post as chief of staff on October 26, 1909, but remained in Connecticut as her commanding officer.
Grant became commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard on March 21, 1910, and simultaneously took command of the 4th Naval District. Two years later, he became head of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Command of the new battleship came in 1913 and command of Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, followed two years later.
In the summer of 1917 — some three months after the United States entered World War I — Grant took over Battleship Force 1, Atlantic Fleet, with additional duty in command of Squadron 2 and Division 4. This position gave him the rank of vice admiral. During the last four months of 1918, Grant served as acting commander of the entire western portion of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet during the absence of Admiral Henry T. Mayo. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his World War I service. In 1919, he became commandant of the Washington Navy Yard and superintendent of the Naval Gun Factory.
Retired on April 6, 1920, Grant died in Philadelphia on September 30, 1930. Grant and his wife Florence Southall (Sharp) Grant (1857–1947) are buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk, Virginia. His great-great-grandson, Richard Weston Grant III, is a graduate of the class of 2009 from the United States Naval Academy.
Namesake
In 1943, the destroyer was named in honor of Grant, sponsored by his granddaughter, Miss Nell Preston Grant.

The second season of the American television series Loki is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Studios, with Eric Martin serving as head writer and Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead leading the directing team.
Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki from the film series, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Eugene Cordero, Tara Strong, Owen Wilson, and Sophia Di Martino also starring, reprising their roles from the first season. Development on a second season had begun by November 2020, and was confirmed in July 2021, with Martin, Benson, and Moorhead all hired by late February 2022. Filming began in June 2022 at Pinewood Studios.
The second season is scheduled to debut on Disney+ in mid-2023, and will consist of six episodes. It will be part of Phase Five of the MCU.
Episodes
All six episodes will be written by Eric Martin, with duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead directing the majority of episodes.
Cast and characters
Starring
Tom Hiddleston as Loki
Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Ravonna Renslayer
Eugene Cordero as Casey / Hunter K-5E
Tara Strong as Miss Minutes
Owen Wilson as Mobius M. Mobius
Sophia Di Martino as Sylvie
Additionally, Ke Huy Quan appears as a Time Variance Authority archivist, and Rafael Casal is cast in an undisclosed "major role".
Production
Development
Development on a second season of Loki had begun by November 2020. In January 2021, the first season's head writer Michael Waldron signed an overall deal with Disney which included his involvement in the second season of Loki. Marvel Studios producer Nate Moore, who served as an executive producer on the series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, believed Loki had "really irreverent and clever and cool" storylines that lent to the series having multiple seasons rather than being a one-off event. The second season was confirmed through a mid-credits scene in the first season finale, which was released in July 2021, and star Tom Hiddleston said "deep discussions" about the second season were already underway. First season director Kate Herron said she would not return for the second season as she had always planned to only be involved for one season, while Waldron said it "remain[ed] to be seen" if he would be involved.
In February 2022, the directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead were hired to direct a majority of the episodes for the second season. They previously directed two episodes of another Marvel Studios series, Moon Knight (2022), which went so well that the studio wanted them to work on other projects and they were quickly chosen for the second season of Loki. Eric Martin, a first-season writer who took over some of Waldron's duties during production on that season, was set to write all six episodes of the second season, with Hiddleston and Waldron confirmed to be returning as executive producers. Benson and Moorhead were excited to approach another character in Loki who, like Moon Knight Marc Spector / Moon Knight, was defined by being an outcast and had "complexity in being [an] outcast". Pre-production had begun by the end of April 2022.
Writing
Waldron said the season would continue the story of the first season but in a way that felt different, subverted expectations, and explored "new emotional ground" for Loki. Hiddleston explained that Loki is once again with the Time Variance Authority (TVA) and working with Mobius M. Mobius, despite Mobius not remembering Loki, and has confronted Sylvie about her actions at the end of the first season. He added that the second season would be "a battle for the soul of the TVA". The season will help connect the entire Multiverse Saga of the MCU.
Casting
Hiddleston, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Eugene Cordero, Tara Strong, Owen Wilson, and Sophia Di Martino return from the first season as Loki, Ravonna Renslayer, Casey / Hunter K-5E, Miss Minutes, Mobius M. Mobius, and Sylvie, respectively. In May 2022, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige stated that the "whole cast" would return from the first season. In July, Rafael Casal was revealed to be cast in an undisclosed "major role" in the season. In September, Ke Huy Quan was revealed to have been cast as a TVA archivist in the season, and Cordero was revealed to have been made a series regular for the season.
Filming
Principal photography began on June 13, 2022, at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, with Benson and Moorhead directing the majority of the episodes, and Isaac Bauman serving as cinematographer. It was previously reported beginning in January 2022, under the working title Architect. In July 2022, location filming occurred throughout London, including at the Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent; the set photos indicated a 1970s setting for some of the season.
Music
Natalie Holt was set to return from the first season as the composer by July 2022, and planned to begin scoring the season in late 2022.
Marketing
Hiddleston, Di Martino, and Wilson shared footage from the season at the 2022 D23 Expo along with announcing Quan's casting.
Release
The second season is scheduled to debut on Disney+ in mid-2023, and will consist of six episodes. It will be part of Phase Five of the MCU.

Since 2019, he has been the director of the Fitzwilliam Museum at the University of Cambridge, prior to which he held positions at the British Museum (1991–2002), the Victoria and Albert Museum (2002–2003), the National Gallery (2003–2012) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (2015–2019). In 2011 he curated the highly acclaimed Leonardo da Vinci exhibition at the National Gallery: Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan. That same year, he played a pivotal role in the controversial authentication of the Salvator Mundi.
Career
Syson received a Bachelor of Arts from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London and would continue studying there for 3 years in the PhD program; his focus was on the 15th-century royal portraiture of Milan, Ferrara, and Mantua. His first professional positions was as the curator of medals at the British Museum from 1991 to 2002. Towards the end of his tenure, he served as co-curater for the Pisanello: Painter to the Renaissance Court exhibition in 2001 and co-created a new permanent gallery: "Enlightenment: Discovering the World in the Eighteenth Century", which opened in 2003. From 2002 to 2003 he subsequently served as a senior curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum, where had a leading role in creating the Medieval and Renaissance Galleries.
He joined the National Gallery in 2003, where he was the head of research and curator of Italian Paintings before 1500. At the National Gallery, Syson led a successful effort in obtaining Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks. Syson was the curator of the Renaissance Siena: Art for a City exhibition in 2007. In 2011, Syson was the head curator for the National Gallery's Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan exhibition, which was a massive success. The exhibition centered around works from Leonardo's first Milanese period (), featuring an unprecedented amount of major works by Leonardo in one location, including the Portrait of a Musician, the Lady with an Ermine, La Belle Ferronnière, Madonna Litta , Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Salvator Mundi and both the Louvre and London versions of the Virgin of the Rocks. Through the Leonardo exhibition and efforts prior, Syson was pivotal in the authentication of Salvator Mundi to Leonardo da Vinci, having five Leonardo experts inspect the painting at the museum. Author Ben Lewis later suggested in The Last Leonardo: The Secret Lives of the World's Most Expensive Painting that Syson had overstated the degree of agreement among the experts, with Carmen C. Bambach expressing skepticism after the museum announced the attribution. In 2019, The Art Newspaper reported that it was "surprising that Syson's entry does not at least allude to the suggestion by other scholars that parts of the picture may have been painted by assistants, even if he went on to dismiss this idea".
He became the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Chairman of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) in 2012. The same year he curated Plain or Fancy? Restraint and Exuberance in the Decorative Arts. While at the MET he led the $22 million renovation of the museum's British Galleries. In 2015, Syson was a candidate for the director of the National Gallery; the position later went to Gabriele Finaldi.
Syson became the director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in 2019, replacing Tim Knox.

Plau am See () is a town in the Ludwigslust-Parchim district, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. It is situated 28 km east of Parchim, and 29 km west of Waren.
Around 1235 the city was called Plawe, that being the Polabian field name for the place where rafting is practiced. The name lasted until the 16th century and was then written according to its German phonetic form Plau. On 11 January 1994, the name of the city was modified by the addition of am See (on Lake) to remove confusion with the similarly named towns of Plaue, Plauen and Plaue.
At the edge of town, there is a protected forest habitat named Plauer Stadtwald (literally: Plau city forest). Among the sights in town are a historic church building, the ruins of the Burg Plau castle and a bridge that may be vertically lifted to allow boats on the channel below to pass through.

Thomas Anthony "Kitty" Gorman (June 9, 1910 – April 8, 1975) was an American football player and coach. Gorman starred as a prep at St. Philip's in Chicago, Illinois. Gorman played center at University of Notre Dame on the freshman team in 1929 and on the varsity from 1930 to 1933. He was one of the team's two captains in 1933. During the 1933 season, Gorman's father wrote a letter to Notre Dame Vice President John Francis O'Hara, complaining that "[t]here is something radically wrong" with Hunk Anderson's coaching, blaming the younger Gorman for losses. Anderson was fired after the 1933 season, the school's first losing season since 1888.
Gorman began his career at Notre Dame playing for famed coach Knute Rockne. James Bacon recounts a story implicating the mob in the Rockne's death that he heard with "Kitty" Gorman from Father John Reynolds when Bacon and Gorman were students at Notre Dame.
After his college playing career, Gorman played in the first Chicago College All-Star Game, tying the Chicago Bears.
Coaching career
Gorman began his coaching career as an assistant on the freshman team at Notre Dame, while pursuing his law degree. Gorman left Notre Dame to serve as the line coach for former Notre Dame fullback Chet A. Wynne at Kentucky. In 1938, Gorman accepted the line coach position under another former Irish football player, Marchmont Schwartz, at Creighton. Gorman served as the head football coach at Washington University in St. Louis in 1942, compiling a career college football coaching record of 5–5. For the 1942 season, he hired two former Notre Dame players to assist him, Andy Pilney and Bud Kerr.
Gorman accepted commission as a lieutenant in the United States Navy and served in World War II. Washington University did not field a football team from 1943 to 1945 and offered Gorman his head coaching position for 1946 with no guarantee that there would be a season. He turned down the offer, due to disagreements with Chancellor Arthur Holly Compton, who emphasized a focus on education and opposed athletic scholarships. Washington University did not play football in 1946, but the team returned for the 1947 season. Gorman left coaching after the war and began working for General Motors in Chicago.
