WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An international organization that sets standards for how countries combat money laundering said it has decided not to hold a planned meeting in Moscow next month due to the continuing Ukraine crisis.

A summit meeting of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was to be held in Moscow in June, in part because the group's current head is Vladimir Nechaev, chief of Russia's anti-money laundering agency.
However, on Sunday, national anti-money laundering agencies belonging to FATF received a notice from the group saying the meeting would be held in Paris instead.
“It became apparent that it would be difficult to ensure full attendance of FATF delegations at the scheduled plenary in Moscow but there was widespread support for the work of the FATF to continue uninterrupted,” the announcement said.
The meeting will now take place during the week of June 22 to 27 at the Paris conference center of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the announcement added.
Sources in both the U.S. and European governments said pressure to cancel the Moscow meeting or move it had been building since civil unrest erupted in Ukraine earlier this year and Russian forces took control of the Crimea region. The officials declined to speak about the matter on the record.
“The simple truth is that it will not be business as usual so long as (Russian President Vladimir) Putin continues to destabilize Ukraine and pose a threat to other nations in the region,” a senior U.S. official said on Monday.
Russian leaders have said their goal is to protect the rights of Russian-speaking minorities in Ukraine, which they assert are under threat from an illegitimate interim government in Kiev that is backed by the United States and European Union.
FATF headquarters in Paris had no immediate comment on why plans to hold the meeting in Moscow had been changed.
FATF brings together chiefs of anti-money laundering agencies, known as “financial intelligence units,” from around the world, and conducts reviews assessing the strength of various countries' efforts to crack down on illicit financial activities.
The decision to move the meeting out of Moscow could be a blow to efforts by the United States and other nations to prod Russia to improve its controls on money laundering.
A former senior U.S. financial investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed dismay at the development, saying FATF members believe Russia's Nechaev had greatly improved his country's anti-money laundering efforts. The Moscow meeting was regarded by some officials as an acknowledgement of these improvements.
‘ELEGANT SOLUTION'
A spokeswoman from the U.S. Treasury, which represents the United States at the meetings, declined to comment on its relocation.
The White House has been urging U.S. corporate executives not to attend another meeting in Russia, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The forum, which runs May 22 to 24, is Russia's main annual economic conference and is used to attract new investors into the country.
The chief executive of Alcoa Inc canceled plans to attend the St. Petersburg meetings, the U.S. aluminum producer said in a statement on Thursday.
In addition, U.S. officials will avoid a biennial meeting next week in Moscow on oil and natural gas called the International Energy Forum, government sources said. The IEF, of which the United States and 80 other countries are members, is headquartered in Riyadh.
Law enforcement experts say that under prodding by FATF, some jurisdictions once known as notorious havens for tax evaders and money launderers, such as Liechtenstein and various offshore islands, had radically tightened their laws and enforcement mechanisms.
The U.S. government's financial intelligence unit is a U.S. Treasury office called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. It and other financial intelligence units police the financial world by requiring financial institutions to routinely notify them of relatively large, or potentially otherwise suspicious, transactions.
Moving the meeting out of Russia “is the most elegant solution for the FATF - when traveling to Moscow for an international meeting was unacceptable, while needing to preserve the technocratic posture and work of the anti-money laundering community,” said former senior Treasury and White House official Juan Zarate.
A 2008 FATF assessment found that Russia, while mostly in line with the group's standards, needed to increase the number of investigations and prosecutions for money laundering and terrorism financing, and give supervisory authorities more power to place sanctions on people who do not comply.
For example, at the time Russia did not prohibit criminal ownership of financial institutions. Russia also needed to be more transparent about who had a controlling interest in companies and banks, and not allow people to open bank accounts anonymously or with made-up names, the assessment found.
But in October, FATF determined that Russia had done enough to improve its deficiencies, and regular follow-up was no longer required.
Morehead State suspended coach Sean Woods for one game on Friday after he pushed an Eagles player during Wednesday's loss at No. 8 Kentucky.
Woods will sit out Monday night's home game against Norfolk State while assistant Dylan Howard coaches in his place.
Morehead State athletic director Brian Hutchinson suspended Woods on Friday after meeting with the coach.
"This will allow Coach Woods to consider his action and behavior, and allow him time to contemplate the appropriate way to conduct himself with his players and on the sideline," Hutchinson said in statement released by the university.
The first-year Eagles' coach pushed Morehead State's Devon Atkinson in the back as the senior point guard walked toward the bench after fouling out with 5:51 remaining.
Woods said in a statement that the situation "will not happen again."
"My behavior during Wednesday night's game was inappropriate and unacceptable," Woods said in the statement. "I am truly sorry."
The former Kentucky guard rarely stood still during the 81-70 loss to his alma mater, pacing the sidelines and getting in Eagles players' faces. Morehead State responded with a physical game in which the Eagles held the lead against Kentucky in both halves.
After the game, Woods defended his coaching style, saying he wanted his team to reflect his passion for the game.
"How did they look tonight? They look just like me, right?" Woods said. "They see me every day and that's how we're going to be every day. We're going to fight. ...
"Every day we step out in practice and in games, we have got to have a chip on our shoulders that we have something to prove."
But Woods crossed the line against Kentucky.
It was his second intense sideline encounter with a player this season. During a 67-45 loss at Maryland on Nov. 12, Woods was seen yelling in the face of Chad Posthumus while the junior center was sitting on the bench.
Eagles junior forward Drew Kelly said that Woods' behavior doesn't make the team uncomfortable.
"We can handle it and it makes us better," Kelly said after the Kentucky game.
Friday's statement was Woods' second apology this week.
On Monday he criticized some of the current Wildcats' attitudes and for their limited knowledge of Kentucky basketball history. It bothered him that Wildcats freshman center Willie Cauley-Stein was unaware of Christian Laettner or "The Shot" that beat Kentucky in the 1992 NCAA East Regional final.
"They don't get it," said Woods, a point guard on that Kentucky team and whose jersey hangs from the Rupp Arena rafters. "They play basketball, but they don't know what basketball really is. And they're very, very fortunate. We live in a microwave society now, and it's a shame that kids don't know the history."
Woods later apologized for those comments via Twitter.
Income inequality peaks prior to severe economic crises. Click for more... Joint Economic Comittee There is only one other period in US history in which inequality was as high as it is now.
That was around 1930, when the super-low tax rates of the late 1920s allowed the richest Americans to coin (and keep) money, and the US economy experienced a brief, euphoric sugar high that ended in the Crash and Great Depression.
In 1932, when the public anger about the Depression and this colossal inequality reached a fever pitch--and US budget deficits soared--tax rates for America's highest earners began to go up.
In 1936, they went up again.
In 1941, with the US saddled with massive Depression and War debts, they went up again.
In 1945, they went up again.
In 1946, the nation's highest earners were paying a mind-boggling 91% of marginal income over $200,000 ($2.4 million in today's dollars) to the government. This was up from only 25% in the late 1920s.
And tax rates stayed that high until the mid-1960s, when they began to come down.
History of US income tax rates (top bracket). Click for more... National Taxpayers Union This massive tax increase on rich people in the 1940s,1950s, and early 1960s, by the way, didn't clobber the economy (contrary to the prevailing current ideology).
Over those two decades, the economy and stock-market and middle-class boomed. The massive inequality that had exacerbated class tensions in the late 1920s and 1930s eased. America went through a multi-decade prosperous expansion that would later be looked back upon as "The Good Times."
But those times are now nearly a half-century ago. And now we've just repeated the 1920s all over again.
In the first decade of the 2000s, super-low tax rates, super-cheap money, massive borrowing, and many other factors fueled an unsustainable sugar-high boom that has since turned to bust. And now the country finds itself saddled with colossal debts (in aggregate, including consumer debts, much higher than those after World War 2), huge budget deficits, and enormous inequality. And tax rates on the richest Americans are still near their all-time lows.
If history repeats itself, our financial problems will eventually be solved, but not without a lot of time and pain. And part of the solution will likely be much higher tax rates, especially on the richest Americans.
So enjoy today's low rates while they last.

A good squeeze can definitely get the blood flowing. But the firm, rhythmic squeezes of an inflatable robot, can keep that blood flowing.
The device—a silicone sleeve ribbed with inflatable tubes—wraps around a waning heart and provides extra muscle-power to pump blood. In early tests, the heart-snuggling sleeve restored blood flow in six living pigs after they had suffered acute cardiac arrest, researchers reported Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine. If the thumping tech passes further testing, it could one day help prolong the lives of people with heart failure, an affliction that strikes around 40 million people worldwide.
It's not the only device that helps weakened hearts to go on. But existing medical devices involve pumps and valves that carry risks of blood clotting and severe blood infections. So, an international team of researchers, headed by scientists at Harvard, set out to make a heart fortifier that doesn't have to contact blood.
Their solution is the squishy silicone sleeve that blankets the whole heart and holds on with a suction device and a gripping gel. Embedded in the silicone are thin rings and spines of inflatable tubes, tethered to an external pump. The tubes inflate and collapse, causing the whole sleeve to contract and twist. The overall movement mimics the activity of the heart muscles and can be tuned to coordinate perfectly with each individual heart.
In experiments in pigs, the devices could almost completely restore blood flow following acute cardiac arrest. After the heart failure, the pigs' hearts pumped about 45 percent of the normal amount of blood. With the device, the blood output gushed up to 97 percent—around two liters per minute. The researchers also found that they could tweak the squeeze to compensate for different weaknesses in a heart, such as glitches with particular chambers.

Ross McCormack has explained how a double-injury blow has effectively written off his troubled season.
The 30-year-old has been struggling with an Achilles injury but also required surgery a fortnight ago to remove five cysts from his jaw, the Daily Mail reports.
McCormack, who was sent on loan to Nottingham Forest after a difficult five months at Aston Villa, said:
“It's been a freakish couple of weeks in what has been an abnormal season for me.
“Forest have been good with me. I wanted to help them but the doctors have advised that I avoid contact in training and rest up.
“I'm not used to seasons where I don't play a lot of games and get my goals. I desperately want to get back to that. Obviously, the move to Villa didn't start as planned but hopefully I can get myself sorted and come back in the summer nice and fresh.”
The pictures below are exclusive to the Daily Mail and they show the extent of McCormack's face swelling.
He recently endured a three-hour operation in Glasgow to remove the cysts which were caused by an infection in his mouth.
The Scot, a £12million signing for Villa last summer, was told to rest for two weeks but then his Achilles injury occurred, and he believes that could be his season over.
McCormack was allowed to leave Villa Park after boss Steve Bruce became frustrated with his off-field issues.
Bruce claimed that the ex-Fulham striker was late for training more than once - and insisted the electric gates to his home were stuck on the final occasion.
A permanent departure in the summer is likely.
Monday, August 21st, marks the 10th anniversary of BioShock, the award-winning FPS from 2K Games. While I could write about the popularity of the game or my favorite memories, I think there's something more important to discuss.
BioShock's political messages and their reflection of our current society.
We've all read multiple articles and blogs about the core themes of Ayn Rand and Objectivism. Bioshock explored a society where people were given absolute freedom from government controls. Science could progress without ethical consideration. Businesses could thrive without restraints on their practices. People could focus on their personal enjoyment first, without worrying about helping anyone else.
Sound familiar?
These ideas have influenced Libertarianism, one of the rising ideologies in American politics. Many people in the United States support the removal of government from citizen's lives. No taxes, no regulations, no restrictions on what one does on their private property, etc.
Now, not everyone who espouses these Objectivist ideals is part of the Libertarian Party, and not every Libertarian is an Objectivist. There are differences between strict Objectivists and many “Right-Wing” Americans.
The choice to focus on personal freedoms over the needs of others, however, falls toward the right of the political spectrum. Many a Republican or Libertarian espouses this individualism at some point in their life.
Given our current social and political divides, the question, “What would happen in such a society?” is all too common.
I should be clear that the fall of Rapture in the game wasn't directly caused by Objectivism, individualism, or Libertarianism. Instead, the story served as a warning against absolute, extreme, and puritanical ideologies, and the hypocrisy of those behind it all.
Andrew Ryan, the leader of Rapture, violated his own philosophy in his pursuit of Objectivism – he limited the freedoms of citizens to keep his society “pure.” In compromising his beliefs, others took umbrage (and advantage), and the city devolved into a civil war.
Also, sound familiar?
We are living in a society where people take ideologies to extremes, residing in an ignorant, black-and-white world where anyone who violates a tenant is “the enemy.”
Like the philosophies of Rapture, there is no gray area. It's extreme individualism for many who believe that any government is evil. When faced with anyone who dares to compromise, let alone sits on the opposite end of the spectrum? The response is often aggressive and irrational.
And yes, I realize “both sides” are guilty, with people attacking others for perceived offense or ignorance. I would remind, however, that extreme individualism and Objectivism? The “me first” mentality, which is in direct contradiction to the words of some Founding Figures? Extremists, who argue for racial or religious supremacy? That is solidly on one end of the spectrum with few exceptions.
We are living in Rapture right now, a world where “personal freedom” is taken to extremes and ideological purity leads to “us versus them” mentalities and conflict.
If someone suggests compromise and the need for government regulation? They're treated as if they just preached from The Communist Manifesto and supported a dictatorship. If someone supports women, minorities, or other disenfranchised groups? They're called names and dismissed as “one of them.”
BioShock may have explored the flawed philosophies of Ayn Rand, but it warned against the flaws of humanity. Here we are, a decade later, and people still haven't learned a thing. If anything, the divide and extremism have only become worse – from political rallies, to the media, to the Internet.
What will happen in such a society?
Hopefully nothing like the events of BioShock.

The founding of the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1918 also led to a cultural renaissance in the region, with a desire to create a distinctive Czech culture spurring decades of artistic experimentation and creativity. One medium many Czechs chose to explore as a platform for thinking about a national type of art was the illustrated book, with covers and pages providing ample space for expression. Local publishers printed original works that were the results of close collaborations between writers, editors, illustrators, typographers, printers, and even paper and ink manufacturers so that the final results were objects that celebrated craftsmanship right at home.
Maximum Imaginativeness: Modern Czech Book Design, 1900–1950, currently on view at the University of Toronto's Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, traces the development of the modern Czech book during the first half of the 20th century through books and journals from the library's own collection. The exhibition spans the years leading up to the Czech national revival until the German occupation of the region during the Nazi regime.
The period between those events, as curator Ksenya Kiebuzinski describes in an accompanying catalogue, gave rise to a whole series of “-isms” as artists took an avant-garde approach to designing books: such movements included Expressionism, Futurism, Constructivism, Surrealism, and Poetism — a local development concerned with “the art of being alive and living life.” The exhibition's title comes from a 1927 essay about another “-ism” — Artificialism — penned by its two associated artists, Jindřich Štyrský and Toyen (born Marie Čermínová), who explored the relationship between art and reality. The works in the show are consequently incredibly diverse, suggesting the myriad ways artists challenged the traditional appearance of the book in their attempts to shape and promote a certain national identity.
One popular trend during the turn of the century was to embellish literature with elaborate, local ornamentations that were mostly Romanesque in style, as exemplified by Josef Mánes' illustrations in a manuscript of 13th- and 14th-century Bohemian poems and songs. Floral motifs also became popular Czech symbols, leading to many flora-filled illustrations such as an intricate woodcut by František Kobliha that gracefully captures the metamorphosis of Daphne into a tree, as told in the myth of Daphne and Apollo.
However, artists later dismissed floral and other ornate symbolism as medieval decorations, especially as Czech culture was increasingly exposed to foreign influences that fueled widespread experimentation. Cubism and collage heavily influenced the artist Josef Čapek, who spent time in France and later produced geometric, simplified illustrations, such as one creative integration of a thief with a block of buildings for Pásmo (1919), a collection of poems by his friend Guillaume Apollinaire.
One of the period's most creative visionaries was Josef Váchal, who was heavily inspired by the occult and the unseen. Váchal himself often participated in séances and was even later suspected by his contemporaries of being possessed. A stark contrast to the delicate decorations of the late 19th century, his woodcuts often featured supernatural and grim imagery such as his frontispiece for Jakub Deml's prose poem “Hrad smrti” (“Castle of Death”), a colored image showing the castle as a skull that clenches the body of the unfortunate protagonist. Also experimenting with such abstract visuals were the founders of Artificialism, Štyrský and Toyen, who drew upon dreams and memories in their creations.
Art made by hand soon grew out of favor with new technological developments beginning in the late 1920s; some found the decorativeness of beautiful book illustrations extravagant, preferring to shape the appearance of books with bold and often stark photomontages. But the spirit of the avant-garde was quelled by the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia beginning in 1938, when literature came under tight control — and was not revived with much freedom following the war with the Communist coup d'état in 1948. Much more than just texts, the books that emerged between the world wars represent an era of the unrestrained Czech voice.
Maximum Imaginativeness: Modern Czech Book Design, 1900–1950 continues at the University of Toronto's Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library (120 St. George Street, Toronto, Canada) through December 18.
• Forward out of England squad and may not play for national team again • Southgate: ‘Other players are in good form and deserve to keep their place'
Wayne Rooney says he has made up his mind about whether to leave Manchester United and has “lots of offers” to consider after becoming such a peripheral figure at Old Trafford. He has been excluded from Gareth Southgate's latest England squad and is facing the end of his international career, comprising 119 caps and 53 goals.
Rooney was a late substitute in the 2-0 win against Ajax in the Europa League final, enabling United's all-time leading scorer to lift the trophy, but that could conceivably have been his last appearance if, as expected, the striker now tries to find a team where he can play more regularly.
“There are lots of offers on the table, both in England and abroad, and that's what I have to decide on,” Rooney said. “I've got some decisions to make now over the next few weeks so I will talk with my family and then I'll decide. I think I have to make a decision in terms of a football decision,and that's what I'll do, I'll do that the next few weeks with my family while I'm away and as soon as I know what's going on I'm sure you will.”
José Mourinho delivers Manchester United glory but pragmatism has limits | Jonathan Wilson Read more
Rooney's diminished position at Old Trafford has led to him being left out of Southgate's last two squads, having been omitted from the 25-man party for the World Cup qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow on 10 June and the friendly against France in Paris three days later. Rooney was also left out of England's games against Germany and Lithuania in March and, at the age of 31, his England career may be over.
“Listen, first of all I've always been a team player,” he said, to the question of whether a player of his stature had found it difficult adjusting to life on the sidelines. “This year, I've never once sulked or let my head drop. I've understood what was best for the team, I've tried to help when the manager's played me.
“Of course I want to play. I want to be on the pitch, of course. A younger me would have been a lot more frustrated. I think I understand what's right and what's needed for the club, and I respect that. Obviously I'm happy to be part of that and in some way help the club win trophies, and that's the way it's been over the last year. That's the decision I have to make now – whether I want to continue doing that or go on and play more regular football.”
Rooney was asked whether, deep down, he had already made up his mind. “More or less, yes,” he said. “I still believe I could [play every game]. If you're asking me if I'm a better player now than I was 10 years ago then obviously I'm not but I still feel I've got other qualities that can help the team.”
Ronald Koeman, the Everton manager, has talked about the possibility of the striker returning to the club where his career started and, though Rooney did not directly mention that option, he reiterated that he would not be tempted by any other English teams. “I've played for two Premier League clubs and they're the only two Premier Leagues clubs I'll play for.”
It is certainly hard to see a way back for Rooney on the international scene after Southgate's squad decision placed him firmly behind Marcus Rashford, Jermain Defoe, Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy in the pecking order
Southgate said: “We have a lot of players playing exceptionally well in the area of the pitch that Wayne plays. I said last time [in March] that he was a bit short of matches – he's had some matches now but we've got players that have done really, really well for us in Adam Lallana and Dele Alli. I can't dress it up any other way. Other players are in really good form and deserve to keep their place.”
When asked what this meant for Rooney's international future, Southgate added: “I've showed that, by selecting Jermain Defoe at 34, if players are playing well and the moment's right then we will involve them in the squad. You never write off a player of Wayne's quality and I'm sure that, next season, he'll be back to playing. He's finished the season a bit better and I'm sure he'll take that into next year.”
Turning to the two matches he is preparing for, the England manager said: “The Scotland game is one of football's great fixtures. We're in a place in the group where a win can really put us in a very strong position, and that's what we want to achieve.
“France is a great challenge for us. Our ambition with our friendly matches is to play the best possible teams – we've done that by playing Spain and Germany already. They're teams we want to test ourselves against and these are great opportunities to learn and improve. A game in the Stade de France will be a brilliant occasion for the players.”

Southgate's decision to include Rashford has effectively ruled the Manchester United striker out of England Under-21s' Euro 2017 campaign in Poland, which starts against the holders, Sweden, on 16 June.
Kane's return also marks the first time Southgate has been able to select the two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner, who has missed all six of the manager's matches through injury.

Jack Butland has returned to the fold after starting Stoke's final five games of the season, following his absence owing to a fractured right ankle. The goalkeeper's most recent cap was in the friendly win against Germany in Berlin in March 2016, when he picked up the injury. He will compete with Fraser Forster, Joe Hart and Tom Heaton for a starting place.
The Tottenham right-back Kieran Trippier has been selected for the first time, while there are call-ups for Middlesbrough's Ben Gibson and West Ham's Aaron Cresswell.
Burnley's Michael Keane will not be involved in the two games, having made his first two appearances against Germany and Lithuania, as he nurses a calf injury. He is nevertheless expected to join up with the side at St George's Park prior to the Scotland match.
The call-up for Trippier, a former Burnley defender, comes after he ousted Kyle Walker from the Tottenham side at the tail end of the season. He joins his club-mate and Liverpool's Nathaniel Clyne in challenging for the right-back slot, while Cresswell edged out Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs on the left side, with Danny Rose and Luke Shaw unfit. Theo Walcott is also omitted for the second successive squad.
Jake Livermore retains his place after a surprise recall in March but the likes of Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge, Ross Barkley and Danny Drinkwater have all been battling injuries.
In the absence of Henderson and Rooney, Gary Cahill is an obvious captaincy candidate, though Kane is also an option to lead his country for the first time.
England squad
Butland (Stoke), Forster (Southampton), Hart (Torino on loan), Heaton (Burnley); Bertrand (Southampton), Cahill (Chelsea), Clyne (Liverpool), Cresswell (West Ham), Gibson (Middlesbrough), Jones (Man Utd), Smalling (Man Utd), Stones (Man City), Trippier, Walker; Alli, Dier (all Tottenham), Lallana (Liverpool), Lingard (Man Utd), Livermore (West Bromwich), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Sterling (Man City); Defoe (Sunderland), Kane (Tottenham), Rashford (Man Utd), Vardy (Leicester).
Yaren, Nauru
I FORGIVE you if you have never heard of my country.
At just 8 square miles, about a third of the size of Manhattan, and located in the southern Pacific Ocean, Nauru appears as merely a pinpoint on most maps — if it is not missing entirely in a vast expanse of blue.
But make no mistake; we are a sovereign nation, with our own language, customs and history dating back 3,000 years. Nauru is worth a quick Internet search, I assure you, for not only will you discover a fascinating country that is often overlooked, you will find an indispensible cautionary tale about life in a place with hard ecological limits.
Phosphate mining, first by foreign companies and later our own, cleared the lush tropical rainforest that once covered our island's interior, scarring the land and leaving only a thin strip of coastline for us to live on. The legacy of exploitation left us with few economic alternatives and one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, and led previous governments to make unwise investments that ultimately squandered our country's savings.
I am not looking for sympathy, but rather warning you what can happen when a country runs out of options. The world is headed down a similar path with the relentless burning of coal and oil, which is altering the planet's climate, melting ice caps, making oceans more acidic and edging us ever closer to a day when no one will be able to take clean water, fertile soil or abundant food for granted.

Climate change also threatens the very existence of many countries in the Pacific, where the sea level is projected to rise three feet or more by the end of the century. Already, Nauru's coast, the only habitable area, is steadily eroding, and communities in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands have been forced to flee their homes to escape record tides. The low-lying nations of Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands may vanish entirely within our grandchildren's lifetimes.
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Poor Rachel Maddow, the MSNBC host with the left-leaning most. She had a point — she had a bombshell point.
And it was a point that would have set her in history books as the One Who Got Donald Trump — no doubt, in her mind, at least.
But sadly, she was done in by her own mouth.
Her rambling, long-winded, partisan-driven drivel kept her from making it.
Happily, President Donald Trump didn't take so long to make his.
On Wednesday, he tweeted: “Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, ‘went to his mailbox' and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS!”
He was referring to the fact that Maddow supposedly was handed a big time news scoop, Trump's tax documents, from one of her network's own reporters — and how he got them is all part of the Big News.
Here's how it all went down, beginning at 7:36 p.m. Eastern Time: Maddow tweeted “BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. (Seriously).”
The “seriously” gave it extra oomph — not to mention extra mystery. It wasn't long before social media got buzzing, wondering the likes of how many tax returns Maddow had, whether she had the paperwork goods that would lead her not only to become the One Who Got Donald Trump, but the One Who Got Donald Trump Impeached.
Well, 8:21 came and went, and nothing. Then 8:22 came and went — and again, nothing. Yes, it was all the way to 8:24 when the next Maddow tweet came out, this one specifying that it was Trump's IRS Form 1040 from 2005.
We've got the goods. Let the Trump tears begin.
And now the show starts, and Maddow starts to talk and as the seconds wear into minutes, and the minutes into many minutes, viewers begin to realize: This lady ain't gonna get to the point any time soon.
“In just a second, we're going to show you exactly what it is we've got,” Maddow said, at the opening of the broadcast hour.
But second must have a different meaning in Maddow world, because it was actually 23 minutes or so into the show — a long 23 minutes, marked by twists and turns into conspiratorial territory about Russia, real estate and the Deutsche Bank — before she hit remotely on the topic of viewer anticipation. Even that was after commercial break.
And by then, wouldn't you know it, the White House had released its own tax information, saying Trump had paid millions of dollars on $150 million worth of income in 2005.
By the time Maddow got to that information, she had moved from the arena of “scoop” into one of “confirmation.” Her highly promoted exclusive turned into little more than a “yes, that's right” to a formal White House release of data.
The White House couldn't help but giggle.
“You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,” a Trump spokesperson said in a statement.
Donald Trump Jr., took a page out of father's book, meanwhile, and took to Twitter.
“Thank you Rachel Maddow,” he wrote, at the show's ending, “for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonald Trump is $ that he paid $40mm in taxes!”
Ouch. That's the big story, though, isn't it? Maddow tried to paint Trump as a tax-dodger, as a thief and robber baron who refused to release his tax records to the public because he had something to hide. But paying that many millions of dollars in taxes?
That's kind of an ad for tax reform that includes hefty tax cuts, isn't it?
Kind of a 23-minute ad, thanks to Maddow and her mouth.
Although it may be tempting to do these things, you should NOT be doing anything with your Pokémon until you are Level 20 unless you have to . You also should not get too attached to any of your early Pokémon, regardless of how cute they are (hard, I know!). I'll explain why in the next section.
When you capture a Pokémon, there are 3 things you can do with it:
Catching a Pokémon involves walking around in real life until they pop up on your map and then capturing them with your Poke Balls. Different types of Pokémon tend to hang around different types of areas (i.e. parks, beaches, shopping malls, etc.), so be prepared to travel.
The purpose of Pokémon GO is to catch all of the different types of Pokémon in the game (147 as of the time of this writing).
The most important thing for you to do from Level 1 to Level 20 is gain XP as fast as possible.
The higher your level, the better the Pokémon you can find and capture are. These Pokémon will be MUCH better than your early ones. In fact, they will be so much better that you shouldn't worry about powering up any of your Pokémon until you are at least Level 20.
The reason Powering Up, Evolving, or Fighting at gyms with your Pokémon is not useful early in the game is that your early Pokémon quickly become obsolete. Don't waste your time or resources on them.

Useful XP Info:
Here is a breakdown of the main ways you gain XP from lowest to highest:
Activating a PokeStop gives you 50 XP.
Catching any Pokémon gives you 100 XP.
Catching a new type of Pokémon you didn't have before gives you 500 XP.
Evolving any Pokémon gives you 500 XP.
Hatching a Pokémon egg gives you 1000 XP. (more on this later)
There is also an item you can use called a Lucky Egg that doubles your XP gain for 30 minutes. You gain your first Lucky Egg at Level 9, and you will be given 3 more over the course of leveling up before you reach Level 20. Save your Lucky Eggs! I will tell you the best time to use them below.

XP Gaining Strategy from Level 1 to Level 9:
From Level 1 to Level 9, you level up simply by walking around and catching Pokémon.
The way to level up fast during this phase is to catch new Pokémon you have never caught before so that you get 500 XP for each of them. Try to go to 2 or 3 different geographic areas and catch new Pokémon there. Walk around until you notice you are not seeing many new Pokémon in those areas and then move on. I would recommend going to at least one grassy area and one area by the water.
Also be on the lookout for the following common Pokémon, and ALWAYS capture these when you see them regardless of what level you are (I still capture these guys even after reaching Level 20, and I'll explain why later):
Pidgey
Rattata
Weedle
Caterpie

XP Gaining Strategy from Level 9 to Level 20:
After Level 9, you will receive your first Lucky Egg, the item that doubles your XP gain for 30 minutes. You will also start to have trouble finding new Pokémon since you have caught most of them already in the previous phase.
From Level 9 to Level 20, you level up primarily by evolving Pokémon. Every time you evolve a Pokémon, you gain 500 XP regardless of whether or not you have done it before. Repeatedly evolve all of your common Pokémon when you have a Lucky Egg active for massive XP boosts. If you evolve a Pokémon while your Lucky Egg is active, you gain 1000 XP each!
So why did I ask you to always capture Pidgeys, Rattatas, Weedles, and Caterpies in the previous section? The reason is that those types are the easiest to evolve!
Every time you capture a Pokémon, you receive 3 candies that can only be used on that Pokémon type. Most of the Pokémon creatures require 50 candies in order to evolve them. Rattatas, however, only require 25 candies. Pidgeys, Weedles, and Caterpies only require 12 candies! Those 3 are the most efficient Pokémon to evolve.
You can also trade in the Pokémon you evolved for 1 extra candy.
—
Let's check out the math!
(Feel free to skip this section if you would rather just take my word for it that Pidgeys are amazing.)
You get 3 candies when you capture a Pidgey. You get 1 candy for trading in the Pidgey after you've evolved it. So each Pidgey is effectively worth 4 candies.
It takes 12 candies to evolve a Pidgey. Since each Pidgey is worth 4 candies, you only need to capture 3 Pidgeys in order to have an evolution ready.
An evolution is worth 500 XP, but if you only perform your evolutions when a Lucky Egg is activated, you get double that: 1000 XP.
Since it takes 3 Pidgeys to evolve and you get 1000 XP for evolving each one, each Pidgey is worth approximately 333 XP (1000 XP divided by 3).
You receive 100 XP for capturing any Pokémon. So capturing a Pidgey is effectively worth 100 XP + 333 XP, which is 433 XP!! That's more than 4 times as much XP as you get for capturing most other Pokémon creatures out there.
That's why Pidgeys are the best, and why they are key to rushing you to Level 20!

When should you use your Lucky Eggs?
As a general guideline, you should activate a Lucky Egg only when you have approximately 30 Pokémon ready to evolve. (Before activating a Lucky Egg, I usually mark all of the ones I plan on evolving by favoriting them. This saves me from having to find them later.)
You need about 160K total XP in order to level yourself up from Level 9 to Level 20. There are 4 Lucky Eggs given to you in this stretch, so you need each Lucky Egg to bring in around 40K XP.
Each Pokémon creature evolution is worth 1K XP. If you have 30 evolutions ready before you activate a Lucky Egg, you will gain at least 30K XP during the duration of a Lucky Egg activation. The other 10K XP you need can be gained by doing other things during the 30 minute window.
You should use your Lucky Egg in a location with an active Pokémon Lure, an item that pulls Pokémon to a particular Poke Stop. It's even better if you can stand within range of multiple Poke Stops with Pokémon Lures on them at the same time. My personal best was finding a location where I could stand within Pokemon-spawning range of 3 lured Poke Stops.
You can also use your Lucky Egg in locations with large concentrations of Poke Stops, and quickly get double XP by walking around and activating each of them in-between catching Pokémon and evolving Pokémon.
The last thing you can do for lots of XP is hatch Pokémon during the Lucky Egg window. In order to hatch a Pokémon, you need to first get eggs by activating Poke Stops (there's a random chance eggs will drop from each one). Next, you place them inside of Egg Incubators which are given to you as you level up. Then you need to walk around until they are about to hatch. When they are close to hatching, activate your Lucky Egg and walk a bit more to hatch them. You will get at least 2000 XP for each egg you hatch.

What happens after Level 20?
After Level 20, it gets a lot harder to level up. Each new level increases the XP requirements by a significant amount, even though everything in the game still gives you the same amount of XP it was giving you before. So during this phase of the game, the emphasis is no longer on leveling.
For Level 20+, you should focus on hatching eggs. Here's why:
1. Since you already captured many of the Pokémon types around you, it's hard to find new Pokémon. You would need to travel to other parts of the country to find them. But with egg hatching, you can randomly get Pokémon creatures that don't exist anywhere near you!
2. When you find a new Pokémon in the wild, you only get 3 candies with it. Even if you find an awesome rare Pokémon, you won't be able to Power Up (upgrade it) much since you don't have enough candies. But when you hatch a 10km egg, you get LOTS of candies and LOTS of Stardust (the other ingredient needed to upgrade Pokémon).
So at Level 20+, your focus should be on catching all the Pokémon. You can do so by being very active and walking around hatching eggs and hoping to get rare ones.
Save up your Stardust and only use it on when you hatch something awesome.

How to speed up egg hatching?
One limiting factor to hatching lots of eggs is that you do not have enough egg incubators. The only way to get additional egg incubators is by spending 150 Poke Coins on them. The only way to get Poke Coins without spending money is by defending gyms.
At level 20, and with rare Pokémon creatures hatching, you should definitely be powerful enough to takeover and defend gyms. For every gym that you have a Pokémon stationed at, you get 500 Stardust and 10 Poke Coins. At max, you can defend up to 10 gyms at once, giving a max daily reward of 5K Stardust and 100 Poke Coins.
The way the gym system works is is that it doesn't matter how long you hold a gym for. There is a button at the top right of your Shop screen that allows you to cash in your rewards for defending gyms. After you cash out, you have to wait 21 hours before cashing out again.
What you want to do is capture as many gyms in a short period time as possible, cash in the reward, and then forget about them until the next day. Your Pokémon will most likely be dead by the time you are able to cash in rewards again the next day but that's perfectly fine. Just heal them up with potions and take over gyms all over again.
Use your strongest Pokémon to fight enemy gyms or to raise the prestige of your own gyms, but leave your weaker Pokémon to be stationed there so that you still have Pokémon to fight with at other gyms. I usually leave my 3rd strongest and down to defend.

That's all the tips I have for Pokémon GO for now. Good luck getting to Level 20 and hatching rare Pokémon!
A 19-year-old man suspected of stealing a massive collection of women's panties and raping people's chickens for a year has been arrested, police said yesterday.
The panties stealer-slash-chicken rapist, only identified as “Nathee,” was taken into custody recently after one woman filed a report that someone broke into her house in Udon Thani's Chiang Pin district and stole 10 sets of underwear and her mobile phone last month.
Police tracked down Nathee and found two sacks loaded with women's underwear at his home.
After he was arrested, almost 100 women in the district came forward to admit their delicates had also been stolen.
Police say that Nathee told them he's been stealing women's underwear for more than a year by creeping up on their clothing racks at night.
Elaborating further on the depths of his compulsion, he reportedly told them how far he was willing to go.
Nathee said if the underwear was still in the washing machine, he would just turn the thing off and fish around for them soggy undies.
If the homeowner was away, Nathee would also steal their valuables and trade them to finance his porn and glue collection.
If they had any chickens, Nathee would rape them.
Huff the glue, get a good buzz going, fish out some panties, turn on the porn and then go steal more of it all. Sounds like quite a life for all but the chicken-fucking.
Nathee will be prosecuted for theft, Sanook reported.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has denied that Turkey bought oil from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) after Russia accused Ankara of turning a blind eye to oil smuggling by the group.
"Shame on you - those who claim we buy oil from Daesh [ISIL] are obliged to prove it. If not, you are a slanderer," Erdoğan said, speaking to officials in the capital on Thursday.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said there was "no doubt" that oil from "terrorist-controlled" territory in Syria was making its way across the border into Turkey.
The accusations came after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on its southern border with Syria, bringing Ankara's relations with Moscow to their worst level in recent memory.
"We see from the sky where these vehicles [carrying oil] are going," Putin said after the incident. "They are going to Turkey day and night."
Erdoğan shot back at Putin saying: "Daesh sells the oil they drill to [Syrian President Bashar] al-Assad. To Assad. Talk this over with Assad you support."
Erdoğan also said Turkey was taking precautions to stop oil smuggling at its borders, a key source of revenue for ISIL.
The president added the places from where Turkey buys its oil and natural gas were well known, citing Russia and Iran as well as Azerbaijan and northern Iraq.
'Standing rules of engagement'
In an opinion piece published by Britain's Times newspaper on Friday, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said discussions were taking place after the downing of the fighter jet.
"While the measures to defend our territory will remain in place, Turkey will work with Russia and our allies to calm tensions," Davutoglu wrote.
"The downing of an unidentified jet in Turkish airspace was not - and is not - an act against a specific country. Turkey took action, based on standing rules of engagement, to protect the integrity of its sovereign territory."
The Turkish prime minister urged all sides not to be distracted "from the cause that unites us".
"The international community must not turn on itself. Otherwise, the only victors will be Daesh and the Syrian regime. This symbiotic relationship keeps both alive," he said.
RELATED: Russia raiding Turkish firms, and sending back imports
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also said Ankara did not need to apologise "on an occasion that we are right," adding he had already said "sorry" in a phone call with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
Earlier, Putin denounced the act as a "stab in the back" by "accomplices of terrorists".
But Erdoğan denied Ankara was collaborating with ISIL.
"Our country's stance against Daesh has been clear since the very beginning," Erdoğan said in his speech in Ankara.
"There is no question mark here. Nobody has the right to dispute our country's fight against Daesh or to incriminate us."
Opposing sides
Turkey and Russia stand on opposing sides of the four-year Syrian conflict, with Ankara pushing for the ouster of Assad by backing moderate opposition rebels.
Moscow is one of the few remaining allies of the Syrian government.
Russia further enraged Turkey with the launch of its air campaign in Syria in September, accusing Moscow of focusing its fire on moderate rebels rather than ISIL fighters.
"Those who carry out a military campaign with the pretext of fighting Daesh are targeting anti-regime opponents," Erdoğan said.
Suspected Assad supporters targeted by US sanctions
"You say you are fighting Daesh. Excuse me, but you are not fighting Daesh. You are killing our Turkmen kinsmen hand-in-hand with the regime in order to clear areas north of Latakia," he said, referring to the Syrian port city.
ISIL fighters have severely damaged Islam and the Muslims, he said, but added there was no difference between "an organisation's terror and state terror," referring to the Assad government.
Erdoğan called Russia a "strategic partner" which he said required solidarity rather threats. "We are saddened by this," he said.
"There is no reason for us to target Russia with which we have multi-faceted and very strong ties, without any border violation," he noted, saying disagreements with Moscow over the Syrian crisis and Ankara's activating its military rules of engagement were two separate things.
"If the same incursion happens today, Turkey will be obliged to retaliate."
Erdoğan also hit back at Putin's charges that Turkey's leaders were encouraging the Islamisation of the country.
"How dare you speak like that," said Erdoğan. "Ninety-nine percent of Turkey is Muslim."
Back in November, George Pataki sent a letter to NBC demanding that he be granted "equal time" to match Donald Trump's appearance on "Saturday Night Live."
In accordance with FCC rules, the long-shot GOP hopeful was eventually rewarded with a handful of free, two-minute segments on NBC affiliates in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
The last of those spots was Tuesday night, when Pataki announced that he was dropping out of the presidential race.
Despite registering 0.0 in the polls, Pataki had been planning -- up until Tuesday morning -- to use that time to air campaign ads, his spokesperson told CNNMoney.
"We filmed two spots," David Catalfamo, Pataki's communications director, said. "We wanted the two minutes to break format and have a 'fireside chat' with voters."
"Ultimately," Catalfamo added, "the campaign decided we didn't have the resources to continue effectively."
Catalfamo said it was his idea to have Pataki use the NBC time to announce his decision. And at 9 p.m., NBC affiliates in the early states aired the "special message" from the former New York governor instead of the previously scheduled campaign ads.
It was a cruel twist, given how hard Pataki had fought for equal time from NBC. Pataki was the first GOP candidate to publicly request "equal time" from the network, and continued negotiating with the network even after other candidates -- John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, James Gilmore and Lindsey Graham -- reached deals for equal time around Thanksgiving.
Ultimately, Pataki was given four 2-minute blocks on the Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina affiliates: two on Christmas, and two on December 29. His calculation, it seemed, was that the free air time would be more valuable to him closer to the caucuses and primaries.
Instead, it provided him with a convenient way to broadcast his exit from the race.
The US military has been working on self-driving vehicles of its own for several years now, and earlier this month a video was published showing just what it's like to take a ride in one. The footage was taken from a GoPro placed right above the driver's seat in one of the Ground Unmanned Support Surrogate (GUSS) vehicles being tested by the Marines. The ultimate goal is for the military to be able to use GUSS vehicles to lighten the load of soldiers by carrying equipment for them — potentially for multiple days at a time — and to keep soldiers further from harm's way in the process.
This new video comes from a Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory test of the vehicles in Oahu, Hawaii. Unlike Google's self-driving car, the military's has a steering wheel and all of the dials and levers you'd expect to see in a car, important here in case a driver needs to shift it into manual. The video above shows the wheel twisting as the vehicle moves slowly forward, though that low speed may be a matter of the vehicle keeping pace with the soldiers ahead of it rather than a system limitation. Earlier videos of GUSS vehicles show that they're actually capable of going much faster than this new video shows, and — impressively — doing so while off road.
A Catholic priest holding mass was stabbed by an ISIS terrorist, who then tried –but failed –to blow up a bomb.
The shocking attack occurred in Sumatra, Indonesia. Father Albert Pandiangan was leading mass in the city of Medan when he was approached by a young man.
He stabbed the priest in the left arm, authorities said. He was carrying a homemade explosive device, but it failed to detonate. He was captured quickly, The Mirror is reporting.
He was also carrying a homemade ISIS flag:
Rina Sari Ginting, a spokeswoman for Medan police, said: “A terrorism act was carried out on Sunday morning at the Saint Joseph Catholic Church. Police are interrogating the perpetrator… and will search his house for any bomb-making materials.”
It is the latest in a string of attacks on Catholics and other religious minorities in the predominantly Muslim country.
Police say they do not believe the attacker was acting alone.
Detective Nur Fallah said: “Somebody tried to kill the priest by pretending to attend the church service and at that time tried to explode something, like a firecracker, but the firecracker didn't explode, it only fumed.”
The priest suffered minor injuries and has been taken to hospital for treatment.
In July a suicide bomber linked to the Islamic State group blew himself up outside a police station in Central Java.
An eyewitness, Markus Harianto Manullan, said the assailant wore a jacket and carried a bag. “He sat in the same row as I did… I saw him fiddling with something in his jacket, and then I heard a small explosion and he immediately ran to the podium,” Manullan said.

Yesterday, the decidedly odd couple of Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) teamed up to introduce legislation that would restore the Glass-Steagall Act (aka the Banking Act of 1933), which would force giant banking institutions to choose between operating as a commercial bank or an investment bank. For decades, Glass-Steagall imposed a firewall between the two, until it was repealed in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act.
Give McCain and Cantwell a big round of applause for their effort, because in Washington, this seemingly obvious response to the financial crisis is considered the domain of wild-eyed hippies (and Paul Volcker.) It is, after all, the sort of idea that would bring real pain to the banking industry, who'd much rather we quickly forget about the collapse of the economy last year and return to business as usual. The most cutting remark against McCain and Cantwell's efforts comes courtesy of Unnamed Treasury Official, who, as you might imagine, is some kind of awesome prick:
I think going back to Glass-Steagall would be like going back to the Walkman.
But hey, you'd go back to your Walkman too, if everytime you put your iPod on shuffle, it blew up the goddamned planet.
YouTube enabled wonks still recall, and celebrate the words of North Dakota Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan, speaking prophetically about the end of Glass-Steagall amid the sound of profiteering way back in 1999:
[WATCH]
DORGAN: I worry very much that the fusing together of the idea of banking, which requires not just safety and soundness to be successful, but the perception of safety and soundness...to merge it with inherently risky, speculative activity, is in my judgment unwise...There are some notions that represent transcendental truths, that are true over time. And one of those, in my judgment, I fervently believe, is that we are -- with this legislation -- we are moving towards greater risk. We are almost certainly moving toward substantial new concentrations and mergers in the financial services industry that is almost certainly not in the interest of consumers, and we are deliberately and certainly moving with this legislation, moving towards much greater risk in our financial services industries. And so, I come to the floor to say that I regret that I cannot support the legislation...I think we will, in ten years time, look back and say, "We should not have done that, because we forgot the lessons of the past."
Of course, Dorgan had this all wrong, because it only took nine years for the nightmare systemic risk scenario to be visited upon us. But McCain and Cantwell are, at least, taking the virtues of Glass-Steagall seriously. Their efforts match those in the House of Representatives, where a group of legislators, led by Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-N.Y.) have introduced parallel legislation. There, they have the support of Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Mary.), who recently told Bloomberg News, "As someone who voted to repeal Glass-Steagall, maybe that was a mistake."
The movement's patron saint is Volcker, the former Fed chair, who recently offered up some grade-A snark when he told the Wall Street Journal's Future of Finance Initiative that the ATM was the only useful innovation that the banking industry had managed to come up with in the past quarter century.
Of course, seeing as how Tall Paul has been treated like the Invisible Man by this administration, one would have to imagine that the White House sees the matter differently. And sure enough, they do. As Newsweek reports: "Obama administration officials have dismissed the idea that the financial sector should or can be changed in more fundamental ways than they are now proposing. You can't turn back the clock, they say, and the new requirements they plan to impose on big banks to hold more capital in reserve, put up $150 billion for a rainy-day rescue fund, and disclose more of their risky trades should be enough to keep the financial sector from imploding again.
"By the time the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed in 1999, the $300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework," Mr. Obama said in a speech on the economy at Cooper Union in New York in March 2008. "Instead of establishing a 21st century regulatory framework, we simply dismantled the old one," thereby encouraging "a winner take all, anything goes environment that helped foster devastating dislocations in our economy."
Of course, that was before Obama's brain was overrun by a passel of scaly Rubinites, who, as the New York Times's Cyrus Sanati puts it, have managed to "soften his views a bit." Sanati identifies the chief culprit thusly: "The change of heart may have something to do with the fact that one of his senior economic advisers is [Larry] Summers." Cast your mind back to one paragraph ago, reflect upon the "$300 million lobbying effort" that Obama railed against, and then let's smash cut to Robert Scheer, writing for the Los Angeles Times in 1999, as history wound its way to Gramm-Leach-Bliley:
Only last week, as the bill was being pushed through a congressional conference committee, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers rushed back from a trip to China to huddle with lobbyists representing Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and other financial giants. The meeting was closed to the media and public, but one participant told the New York Times that Summers lectured the lobbyists on how to spin this bill so it appears to be in the public interest. "He said it would be very unfortunate if any financial institution were to suggest that they do not see the broad public purpose of this legislation," the lobbyist reported. Also last week, it was announced that Robert E. Rubin, the man who handpicked Summers to replace him as secretary of the Treasury, will take a position as co-chairman of Citigroup, which lobbied heavily for this legislation, as did Goldman Sachs, Rubin's company before joining the Clinton administration.
I guess the world looks a lot different when you are at Cooper Union, outside of the Machine That Softens Your Views With Lobbyists.
Story highlights The poll was taken the three days following the second national debate Sunday
It also comes after the leaked video of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals.
Washington (CNN) A new national poll from Fox News finds Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 7 percentage points among likely voters.
The poll was taken following the second national debate Sunday and the surfacing of a leaked 2005 tape showing Trump making a series of offensive sexual remarks about women.
In the wake of these major campaign events, the poll found Clinton receiving 45% support of likely voters compared to Trump's 38%. Third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein received 7% and 3% support, respectively.
Clinton held a wider lead over Trump in a head-to-head matchup, where she received 49% support to Trump's 41%.
The poll showed Clinton gaining since the last Fox News survey released, which had her up only by 2 percentage points, within the poll's margin of error.

The federal budget FY2017-18 with a Rs4.75 trillion outlay was approved by the National Assembly on Tuesday in the absence of members of the opposition.
This is the first time that a finance bill has been passed in Pakistan without the inclusion of the opposition in the assembly. Since the opposition was not present during the proceedings, all cut motions against the bill were dropped.
The bill was passed after Leader of the Opposition Syed Khurshid Shah gave a statement on the floor and then proceeded to walk out of the assembly with the other members of the opposition.
Concluding the discussion session on the budget, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar noted that out of the 276 recommendations made by the Senate, 75 had been partially or wholly approved while 137 recommendations had been sent to the planning commission.
The finance minister exclaimed that some elements had suggested that the budget held no worth without a date set for the National Finance Commission (NFC) award.
"The government wishes the early completion of the NFC award... however, the award is being delayed by the provinces," he alleged.
Dar asserted that the impression of increased foreign loans was incorrect and that in the coming year the government would continue to battle terrorism.
"We have allotted Rs90 billion for fighting extremism," Dar stated.
The National Assembly approved Rs3.45tr for ministries and divisions during the session. This included the approval of Rs928.58bn for the defence ministry, Rs107.02bn for the interior ministry, Rs11.5bn for the aviation division, Rs14.8bn for the establishment division, Rs51.16bn for the cabinet division and Rs5.11bn for the defence production division.
Education: Guaranteeing Access Isn't Enough
In a recent email, a professor of sociology expressed some skepticism about what she regarded as over-enthusiastic treatment of the possibilities for new education models in a stateless society. Among other things, she questioned the apparent claim that new media, online courses and free lectures would “save the education system” or provide access to education.
My response to these points is that 1) we should first address the prior question of the nature of the system we're guaranteeing access to, and 2) the current education system needs to be destroyed, not saved.
The critic seems to be treating the need for “education” as relatively static, and asking only how the models for delivering it would be different in a stateless society. The real question is, whose needs are being served right now? One thing is for sure — it's definitely not the students'. The customers, or clients, of today's educational system are corporate employers. Students are simply the raw material. The specifications for what “needs” to be taught today, and the whole institutional system for delivering it, were set by a century-old interlocking constellation of institutions centered on large mass-production industry.
Discussions of “guaranteeing access” to education, healthcare, jobs and so forth on the mainstream Left seem to follow a common pattern. First, the good in question is a necessary input into the existing corporate system. Second, consumption of the good by ordinary people is transformed into one of Ivan Illich's “radical monopolies,” participation in which becomes becomes a fundamental requirement for survival. And third, it's institutionalized under the control of a professionalized administrative caste which maintains a monopoly on providing the good.
The mainstream Left tends to focus almost entirely on how access to that given model can be “guaranteed,” with little or no discussion of changing the internal culture of the institutional system that delivers it, or changing the extent to which it is a radical monopoly that people are required to participate in to have comfortable subsistence.
It reminds me of what Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt have said about the social democratic agenda which, far from taking advantage of the liberatory potential of new technology to abolish work or enable a Kropotkinian vision of self-managed cooperative shops in agro-industrial villages, aims “to reintegrate the working class within capital.” “It would mean, on the one hand, re-creating the mechanisms by which capital can engage, manage, and organize productive forces and, on the other, resurrecting the welfare structures and social mechanisms necessary for capital to guarantee the social reproduction of the working class.”
Our anarchistic vision involves not simply abolishing the educational system as we know it, but also abolishing all the institutional customers for that system's product. One thing I constantly emphasize is that, in an economy of self-managed cooperative production, self-employment, and direct production for use in the informal/household sector, the kind of education being demanded for employment wouldn't be driven mainly by the needs of corporate Human Resources departments. They'd be set by the actual recipients of education, which in turn would be set on an ad hoc basis by individual workers negotiating as equals with small, self-organized production groups.
In the same email, the correspondent raises the question of what administrative and other overhead costs have to do with “abolishing the state and thus public education, and outsourcing it to new media.”
The answer is that the rise of higher education as a high-overhead, capital-intensive institution directly mirrors the rise of mass-production industry on the same model. And in both cases, high overhead was an entry barrier that empowered giant, hierarchical institutions that used human beings as raw material (human resources).

The representatives in our esteemed Republican Congress have failed to show any backbone when it comes to standing up to President Trump. How can they sit back and say nothing when he lies on a daily basis? He is being fact-checked by the media when his statements appear to be ridiculous and often found to be incorrect. Nevertheless he is not called on the carpet by anyone in the GOP and gets away with whatever outlandish statements he makes, such as President Obama wire tapping his headquarters during the campaign.
My goodness are the American people that naive? He is scamming his base, and they continue to stand by him as he embarrasses our nation and his Republican Party. Where is the Grand Old Party? Not so grand right now. Are they sleeping on the job? Two pages of Mr. Trump's 2005 tax return surfaced on March 14. Interesting that the two pages clearly showed that in 2005 Mr. Trump earned $150 million and paid 25 percent in taxes in the amount of $38 million. Wow, very impressive.
Is anyone at all suspect that perhaps Mr. Trump and his cronies leaked these two pages to change the current dialogue regarding health care and wire tapping? We would really like to see his current tax returns and his possible connection to Russia. That doesn't seem to be happening does it? It is all too exhausting and I for one am tired of his shenanigans. It's time for his colleagues to put some pressure on him to begin acting like the leader of the free world or encourage him to retire to his estate in Florida.
Respect for the USA is being lost on the world stage each day that goes by with him leading our country.

Stewart-Haas Racing's Kevin Harvick has had a fast No. 4 Chevrolet all weekend long, topping the speed charts in Saturday's final Sprint Cup Series practice at Atlanta Motor Speedway with a lap at 191.054 mph.
Harvick qualified second for Sunday's race and was second-quick in Friday's lone practice session after being third in both sessions during Thursday's test.
However, the reigning series champion will not start Sunday's Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at the front of the field. The Hendrick-built engine in Harvick's car let go 35 minutes into final practice, ending Harvick's practice early and forcing the team to swap out motors.

"This is a very rare occasion," Harvick said after talking with representatives from the Hendrick Motorsports engine department. "This is the first one (blown engine) I have ever had. The engine shop does a great job. I am just glad that it happened today. Our Jimmy John's/Budweiser team is doing a great job and the car is handling good. If we were going to have something happen, this is a good place to have it happen because you can pass."
Due to the engine failure, Harvick will have to start Sunday's race from the rear where he will join Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth and Tony Stewart, all of whom were among 13 drivers whose cars failed to clear NASCAR technical inspection before Friday night's first round of knockout qualifying.
Last year's Atlanta winner, Kasey Kahne, was second fastest in the weekend's final practice session, followed by Austin Dillon, Denny Hamlin, Carl Edwards, AJ Allmendinger, Johnson, Clint Bowyer, Casey Mears and Jamie McMurray.

A thought experiment involving a paradox of pigeons shows a new kind of quantum link that could be happening everywhere in the cosmos, all the time
(Image: Sweetvenom Photography/Getty Images)
PARTICLES on opposite ends of the universe can link quantum mechanical hands. The phenomenon hints at an entirely new aspect of the quantum reality underlying all matter.
The effect is a sort of inversion of one of the most famous and profound quantum properties, called entanglement. Two entangled particles share a single quantum state: they behave as one and cannot be described individually. Measuring one instantaneously affects the other, no matter how far apart they become, an oddity that prompted Einstein to describe entanglement as “spooky action at a distance”.
However, for this to happen the particles must have interacted in some way when they came into existence, which may mean only a small fraction of the particles in the universe are entangled at any given time. Cosmic connections make no such demands. “They have no interaction, they have no idea that the other particle even existed,” says Jeff Tollaksen of Chapman University in Orange, California.

Entangled particles have to interact. These cosmic connections make no such demands
The effect is based on work by Yakir Aharonov, also at Chapman University, in the 1960s. He and his colleagues showed that, mathematically speaking, a system's properties can be influenced by measurements made in the future. Aharonov has been studying the strange consequences of this “post-selection” process ever since.
Now Aharonov, Tollaksen, Sandu Popescu and their colleagues show mathematically that post-selection should link any two particles every time their quantum properties are measured, no matter where they are in the universe. In other words, all particles everywhere could be linked, provided they have been post-selected in some way. “Is that mind-blowing or is that mind-blowing?” Tollaksen says.
Knowing that such an extraordinary claim would need to be backed up, the researchers devised a thought experiment to demonstrate the simplest case in which a cosmic correlation between two particles would be obvious and testable. The thought experiment, which the team calls the “quantum pigeonhole effect”, reveals how quantum particles subvert the rules of regular mathematics.
Imagine you have to house three pigeons in two pigeonholes. In the classical world, it's obvious that at least two pigeons will have to share.
Swap your pigeons
But for quantum particles, this is not necessarily true. Swap your pigeons for electrons, and send them three at a time into an interferometer. This device splits each electron into two, sends them along both paths simultaneously, then brings them together again.
Then “post-select” some of the electrons to influence their past state. You do this by measuring the electrons' states when they exit the interferometer, selecting electrons in a particular state that is significantly different to the one they had when they entered. That should create quantum links between those electrons, Tollaksen says (see diagram).FIG-mg29802301.jpg
To show the links are really there, you need to know what the electrons are doing inside the device. Another quantum effect, called superposition, means that each electron takes both paths at once. If any two of the three electrons share one arm, which must happen classically, their identical electrical charges will repel one another, deflecting their trajectories ever so slightly. That deflection should be detectable when the electrons exit the interferometer.
Because superposition is a delicate state, if you try to measure the path any electron took, it will pick a side and you will find it in one or the other. But if you check the paths of any pair of the three original electrons, the detector will show no deflection has happened. In other words, you can have three pigeons and two boxes, and yet no two pigeons are ever found in the same box. A linkage must exist, because it's as if the particles know the other is there, and avoid each other.
You can have three pigeons and two boxes, and yet no two pigeons are ever found in the same box
Furthermore, this works no matter how many pigeons you have. “You can put an infinite number of pigeons in two boxes, and no two pigeons will be in the same box,” says Tollaksen (arxiv.org/abs/1407.3194).
The quantum pigeonhole effect is the simplest way to test the idea that unrelated particles can be correlated simply by being post-selected. You would only need to bring the particles together in the interferometer to test that they are in fact correlated. In theory, these electrons could be spread across the universe, never come anywhere near each other, and mere post-selection would link them up.
Given that this is happening to real particles all the time, either due to human measurements or natural interactions, does this mean that particles everywhere in the universe are correlated? “I'd say that the answer to that is yes,” says Tollaksen.
This is a surprising breakthrough, says Paul Davies at Arizona State University in Tempe. “It's remarkable that it's still possible to discover something fundamentally new about quantum mechanics, which has been around for nearly 100 years,” he says. “Here we see a richer, more complex set of long-range correlations that nobody knew existed before.”
What's more, Davies points out that the effect emerges from standard quantum mechanics. “It's really important to emphasise that this is not somebody's alternative to quantum mechanics. Anybody since the 1920s could have discovered what we are talking about now.”
While Davies thinks it's too early to predict practical implications, Tollaksen thinks they could be far-ranging.
Entanglement eventually spawned the entire field of quantum cryptography and quantum computing. But while entanglement is extremely tricky to work with, since creating entangled particles is very difficult, that's not the case with cosmic correlations. “Here we have this non-classical resource basically everywhere,” says Tollaksen. “That simple fact could turn out to have unique technological utility.”
Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is more reserved. He thinks the idea is interesting and fun, but points out that the effect only works in certain circumstances, which may dampen its universality.
“It is at least as much a statement about the weirdness of post-selection, as it is about the weirdness of quantum mechanics itself,” he says. “If you just have ordinary quantum mechanics without post-selection, then you don't get the effect they're talking about.” You also have to be careful how you ask about whether any two pigeons share a hole, he says.
Ultimately, someone will have to perform the experiment for real. “It would actually be much more shocking and revolutionary if people did the experiments we suggest and they turned out to be false,” says Tollaksen. “Then we would have the very first ever experimental proof that quantum mechanics is wrong. But I'm sure that won't happen.”

Eight matches. Seven months. One spot in Russia.
We'll likely know if the US men's national team will be headed to the 2018 World Cup by Oct. 10, when they'll close the CONCACAF Hexagonal with a match at Trinidad and Tobago. In the event the US finishes fourth in Hex, we won't know their fate for another month, with the fourth-place CONCACAF finisher advancing to a home-and-home playoff against the fifth-place finisher from Asia on Nov. 14.
Either way, there's a good deal of uncertainty whether or not the US will actually get to Russia. The narrow 2-1 home loss to Mexico and 4-0 thrashing at Costa Rica that cost Jurgen Klinsmann his job in November put the team in a significant hole, with the US in dead last in the Hex ahead of their upcoming qualifiers against Honduras (March 24 at San Jose's Avaya Stadium) and at Panama in March.
The Americans are in unfamiliar territory, but that's only fitting for a team going through its biggest transition in years. New head coach Bruce Arena has a January camp and a couple of friendlies under his belt, but he hasn't yet had a chance to call in his full group.
Plenty of MLS players are in the mix of course, with several locked in tight positional battles and others fighting for roster spots. Here are a five MLS-centric USMNT questions I'll be keeping an eye on as the national team moves through qualifying in 2017.
Who wins the Benny Feilhaber vs. Sacha Kljestan battle?
The No. 1 question from January camp remains one of Arena's biggest quandaries heading into the March qualifiers: Who will start at attacking midfield?
For now, Sporting Kansas City's Feilhaber and the New York Red Bulls' Kljestan appear to be the favorites. Both participated in January camp, with Feilhaber looking a little sharper in his start in the USA's 1-0 win over Jamaica than Kljestan did when he got a run out in the team's scoreless draw against Serbia.
That said, Kljestan had the better 2016 MLS season, and he was electric when he played in a couple of qualifiers under Klinsmann late last summer. He's shown chemistry with the US's A-midfield, something Feilhaber hasn't had a chance at yet.
In my mind, that gives Kljestan a slight edge to start over Feilhaber heading into the qualifiers against Honduras and Panama in a few weeks. Both players will likely be consistent call-ups throughout the year, however – if one lights it up in MLS, he'll get a chance with the national team.
Who starts in goal?
Eventually, this battle will likely come down to the Colorado Rapids' Tim Howard and incoming Atlanta United goalkeeper Brad Guzan. For March, however, who gets the nod in net is a bit of an open question.
Howard, 37, is still working his way back from an adductor injury suffered in the loss to Mexico, and doesn't look like he'll be ready by the time qualifying starts up again. Guzan would normally be the surefire starter behind Howard. But the 32-year-old, who will move to Atlanta this summer, isn't playing at English Premier League club Middlesbrough.
Arena has said that he won't rule out Guzan just because he's not getting consistent playing time. But his lack of starts – he's played just three games in all competitions in 2017 – certainly opens the door for several others to step in.
Real Salt Lake's Nick Rimando is likely No. 1 on the list behind Guzan, as the 37-year-old has the experience and trust from Arena necessary to start in a pair of hugely important qualifiers. Others in the running include San Jose's David Bingham and New York's Luis Robles, both of whom participated at January camp and each played a half in the win against Jamaica.
Another MLS ‘keeper to keep an eye on? D.C. United's Bill Hamid. The 2014 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year missed January camp due to an injury, but he looks fully healthy now and has the talent to play a major role for the US in the longer term.
Will Clint Dempsey return? And what will it look like?
After missing the second half of 2016 due to a heart condition, Clint Dempsey is back fully participating with the Seattle Sounders and should be a go for their opener at Houston this weekend. Arena said in January that he won't be calling the soon-to-be 34-year-old for the March qualifiers. But if he plays well for Seattle, it's hard not see him earning a call-up in the summer.
If Dempsey does work his way back into the mix, there are questions about the role he'd play under Arena. Toronto's Jozy Altidore and Hamburg striker Bobby Wood showed pretty excellent chemistry together up top in 2016, and Seattle attacker Jordan Morris has emerged as a pretty solid backup.
It'd be a bit strange to see Dempsey relegated to a reserve role with the USMNT, but I'm not sure that he'd unseat Wood or Altidore – at least in the short term. Given how those two played together last year, Altidore's incredible form down the stretch in 2016 and Wood's decent strike rate with Hamburg, I'd guess Arena would be loath to break them up.
A lot can change in three months. But if Dempsey is back in the USMNT picture for the June qualifiers against Trinidad and Tobago and at Mexico, it might be as a substitute.
Will Kekuta Manneh play a role?
He's not yet fully eligible (and might not be until he turns 23 in late December), but Vancouver Whitecaps attacker and new US citizen Kekuta Manneh has a huge opportunity to work himself into the national team picture this year.
The Whitecaps attacker had a disappointing 2016, recording five goals and two assists in 17 appearances before an injury to his right foot brought his season to an abrupt halt in July. He's now fully healthy – and fully on Arena's radar. The 22-year-old newly-minted US citizen was called into the January camp and is off to a solid start with the ‘Caps, scoring in their 1-1 draw at New York in the first leg of their CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal series last week.
The Gambia-born Manneh is still waiting to be cleared by FIFA before he can play a match for the USMNT. But it's really, really tempting to picture him coming on late and flat burning an opposing defender with his terrific speed. If he puts together a good year for the ‘Caps, he might just tempt Arena, too.
*Watch out for SKC's Dom Dwyer, who is set to receive his US citizenship in the next couple of months, as a potential option this summer.
Who will make the leap?
Aside from Manneh, several really intriguing young players received their first call-ups during the January camp.
The leading names on my list are LA Galaxy midfielder Sebastian Lletget and FC Dallas defender Walker Zimmerman. Lletget in particular looks poised for big things this year. The 24-year-old seems set for a role on the wing with LA, but, as former Galaxy boss Arena knows, he's more than capable of playing centrally, too. He played 135 minutes in the two friendlies that closed January camp. With Jermaine Jones suspended against Honduras, he just might be in line for a start against Honduras.
Zimmerman, 23, has to work through a bit of a longer line to see significant playing time at center back. But it's hard not to love what he and fellow USMNT fringe player Matt Hedges did with FC Dallas last year. The imposing defender finished third in the Defender of the Year voting, and, if he continues developing, has the tools to be a success on the international level.
Lletget and Zimmerman could get some looks in qualifying, but there are some other youngsters around MLS that will likely merit consideration for the Gold Cup. Seattle's Cristian Roldan seems like a relatively safe bet to work himself into the mix, while I could see a few other players – say, New York's Sean Davis and New England's Kelyn Rowe – getting some love with big years in MLS.

WASHINGTON — Over the past several days, the U.S. military has been increasing its combat power at a remote training facility near the Tanf border crossing in Syria in preparation for any aggression by pro-regime and Iranian-backed militias, which have been massing forces in the area, according to Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve.
The development comes as militias aligned to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and groups backed by Iran have steadily massed forces just outside the 55 kilometer-radius deconfliction zone around the Tanf region since the beginning of May. Those forces have tanks, artillery and modified pickup trucks with mounted heavy weapons, Dillon said.
The training facility at Tanf rests near a strategic border crossing between Syria and Iraq and houses a couple hundred coalition and partner forces. Force protection at the remote base has been a primary concern, according to officials at U.S. Central Command. The U.S. military has "ensured our forces are prepared and ready to defend themselves," Dillon said. U.S. air-power has "constant coverage over our forces at Al Tanf," to respond to hostile actors and to watch threats to U.S. and partner forces at the facility.
On May 18, coalition jets launched a strike against a pro-regime convoy that had trespassed into the deconfliction zone after that convoy refused to react to a show-of-force flyover and warning shots. The airstrike destroyed an armored vehicle and bulldozer. Those forces halted their forward progress but are still deep within the zone, and are considered a threat, Dillon said.
Forces outside the deconfliction zone are continuing to mass and are actively patrolling the area, he said.
Officials in Baghdad are still trying to convince the pro-regime militias that they need to vacate the area. Over the weekend, U.S. forces dropped leaflets warning the militias to leave the zone.
The U.S. is also using the telephone hotline established with the Russians to avoid mid-air mishaps. We are "offering [the militias] a way to vacate the area through the deconfliction line with the Russians," Dillon said.
The militias responded, via the Russians, that they are in the area to fight ISIS, he said. However, analysts suspect the militias' primary goal is to establish a land corridor to link Iran with Damascus and its Shia proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon. "it is a key part of a network of connections for Iran," said Luke Coffey, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.

U.S. and coalition forces operating at the Tanf training facility use the location to train two partner forces, the Maghawir al-Thawra and Shohada al-Quartayn. CENTCOM contends these groups are anti-ISIS fighters, but in the past they have fought against the Assad regime.
There has not been another incident between U.S. and pro-regime forces near Tanf since May 18, despite the increasing level of tension. It is "difficult to say why there have not been any kinetic actions again," Coffey told Military Times. "It could be the next step," but commanders on the ground have the tactical situational awareness to make such a call, he said.
FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Atlanta Falcons rookie receiver Justin Hardy is holding his own during training camp.
He was holding something else following Monday's practice.
The fourth-round pick from East Carolina was spotted toting star receiver Julio Jones' shoulder pads following the two-hour session. Hardy seemed to shy away when he saw the camera pointed as his face, but he accepted his duties without any complaints. He was the anti-Dez Bryant.

Jones was asked about having the rookie carry his pads.
"That's just what rookies got to do," Jones said. "I mean, it's no hazing. We don't do hazing here. It's all about just showing those guys how to be a great teammate. I'm over here doing other things and I wasn't able to grab my pads. So I was like, 'Hey Hardy, grab these.' And he's like, 'All right, cool.'"
From a distance, it appeared at least one rookie offensive lineman had to carry pads as well.
On a different note, Jones praised what he's seen from Hardy on the field thus far.
"His work ethic, he comes to work," Jones said. "He's a young guy, so he's willing to learn. He didn't come in like he knew everything. He's taking coaching. He's listen to me and Roddy (White) and also (receivers coach) Terry Robiskie."

Jerry Brown and other “blue state” leaders will have some leeway to avoid Zombie Trumpcare's worst features. But hardly all of them.
Amid all the appropriately intense discussion of the terrible things states would be allowed to do to people with preexisting conditions in the health-care bill the House is considering today, there is some danger of obscuring the bigger picture. Trumpcare, at least in its current form, will allow states to decide whether to carry on with something resembling the systems in place under Obamacare, or to opt out of various key requirements under current law — including the one protecting people with preexisting conditions. It seems safe to assume that most blue states will not even consider applying for waivers to screw over their own most vulnerable citizens. But at the same time, there are many provisions in the revised American Health Care Act that will affect people everywhere, often not in a good way.
States like New York, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia — states with Democratic governors and/or legislatures — are not going to seek exemptions from Obamacare requirements affecting the essential benefits health plans must offer, or prohibiting discrimination on the basis of health conditions. And there may be other states that don't accept the poisoned chalice of health-policy autonomy. One of the House Republicans who seems to be coming around to a vote for Zombie Trumpcare, Carlos Curbelo, offered that excuse, even for his own red state of Florida:
I would highly doubt that any governor, especially the governor of a large state like Florida, would seek a waiver. I just don't think that any state would want to carry the burden of managing health care more than they already do, through Medicaid.
Actually, it's not clear that most of the people priced out of the individual health-care market by preexisting conditions would qualify for Medicaid, particularly in non-expansion states like Florida. But it is true that applying for the waivers that the House Freedom Caucus demanded will at least be controversial in the states that consider it.
For many of Zombie Trumpcare's provisions, however, there's not really much state flexibility at all. Indeed, blue states — most of which took advantage of Obamacare's optional expansion of Medicaid — will be most affected by the bill's abrupt termination of enhanced federal funds for the expanded population. Indeed, of the 24 million Americans the Congressional Budget Office estimated would lose health coverage under the original Trumpcare bill, 14 million would lose Medicaid coverage.
Some of the Obamacare regulations Zombie Trumpcare seeks to revoke and/or replace also are not optional, including the expansion of allowable price discrimination based on age and the elimination of the individual purchasing mandate (to be replaced by a surcharge on people who wait to buy insurance until they are sick).
Zombie Trumpcare also gets rid of the tax subsidies set up by Obamacare, and creates its own tax-credit system, with arguably very insufficient credit amounts, especially for low-income and older people. None of this can be waived for any states.
And the cost-sharing-reduction subsidies that have been critical in keeping insurers offering coverage under the Obamacare exchanges — the subsidies the administration has been threatening off and on to withhold — would be formally killed as well.
Finally, there are all sorts of little-recognized side effects of Zombie Trumpcare — such as the unraveling of benefit requirements for employer-sponsored health insurance — that do not discriminate by geography. And there is one big national provision that could do vast damage to women's health care, especially in rural areas: the prohibition on any federal funds for Planned Parenthood.
It is worth watching closely the special provisions cooked into this legislation that affect certain states exclusively. The original AHCA (and hence its successors) included a deal to secure votes from upstate New York GOP House members that shifted Medicaid costs from county to state taxpayers. More of that sort of home cooking could be tucked into the legislation later.
We have no way of knowing what the Senate will do to the “state flexibility” provisions that have been so important to Zombie Trumpcare's struggle towards House passage. On the one hand, there may be some “moderate” GOP resistance to how far conservative states will be allowed and encouraged to go in messing with poorer and sicker people who have benefited from Obamacare. On the other hand, some Republican senators—notably Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins—want to go much further in allowing states to go their own way, to the point of letting blue states keep most of Obamacare in place.
For blue-state progressives, this may be a tempting approach insofar as it insulates them from much of the damage wrought by an Obamacare replacement. But they need to ask themselves if they are willing to sell vulnerable red-state people down the river and accept a sort of health-policy apartheid. Republicans may not actually give them a lot of choice, but it's important for everyone to understand the trade-offs involved in getting this unwieldy beast of a health-care bill to Donald Trump's desk.
The Canadian Press
Scientists are accusing Premier Gordon Campbell's Liberal government of allowing the province's prehistoric heritage to be ground up for cat litter.
International and B.C. paleontologists say the government has a Stone Age attitude that contributes to the destruction of the province's vast fossil heritage.
British Columbia is the only province in Canada with fossil sites that doesn't have a dedicated law protecting the sites from plunder or industrial exploration.
And while the B.C. agriculture minister acknowledges there are "gaps" in the patchwork of laws covering the sites, he couldn't promise new legislation would be in the works.
The issue has come up again after Tumbler Ridge paleontologist Richard McCrea said last week he has found a major fossil site in northeast B.C. which he is keeping quiet about because he's concerned it will be plundered.
SFU paleontologist Bruce Archibald said Tuesday he's met with three Liberal cabinet ministers -- Stan Hagen, George Abbott and Pat Bell -- over the past decade about government protection of fossil sites, but the destruction continues.
Harvard-trained Archibald, an expert in the 50-million-year-old Eocene period, said one of his prime exploration sites near Cache Creek, B.C. called the McAbee fossil site allows commercial fossil hunting, roadbuilding and mining for cat litter.
"There are two claims on the McAbee, one by the fossil dealers and one by the miners who are grinding up the fossil-bearing shale," he said.
Archibald is calling on the government to assume ownership of the site, including the areas claimed by the fossil dealers and cat-litter miners.
"The province has ignored paleontology to a great degree (and) other jurisdictions have embraced it," he said.
"The result is not just that things are sitting here undone, the result is there's a great negative impact of destruction and loss. Once these things are lost, you can't grow them back or reimport them. They are gone forever."
Other provinces have used their paleontological heritage for scientific and economic gain, said Archibald, citing Alberta's Tyrrell Museum and the Royal Ontario Museum.
Gareth Dyke, a paleontologist with the University of Ireland, wrote Campbell in 2009 with concerns about non-scientific activity at the McAbee site.
"I'd like to highlight the fact that despite the importance of this globally unique fossil site, the McAbee remains almost completely unprotected by the current management plan, which leaves it under the control of commercial fossil dealers and an operation that grinds the fossil-bearing shale into Kitty Litter."
Agriculture and Lands Minister Steve Thomson said there is a memorandum of understanding in place the protects the most significant fossils at the McAbee site.
He said British Columbia has heritage protection laws, but not one specific, designated protection law.
He said the government amended the Land Act last spring to manage fossil sites while the Heritage Conservation Act, Park Act, Mineral Tenure Act, Park Act and Ecological Reserve Act all have fossil protection provisions.
Thomson said the government recently completed a public consultation process that examined a fossil management framework, but its results and recommendations have yet to be made public.
"We know there are some gaps with the process," he said.
But Thomson would not promise new legislation government heritage protection.
"It may be around ensuring using the tools that we have," he said.
Tumbler Ridge's McCrea said British Columbia's indifferent approach to heritage protection amounts to a missed scientific and economic opportunity.
"The whole thing for paleontology for British Columbia is a major black eye for the province," he said. "They look at it as an expense. They don't see the value in it."
McCrea said he tells people he meets on his expeditions that he's a geologist looking for coal seams because he doesn't want to tip them off that there may be dinosaur fossils in the area.
McCrea recently found what he believes is a major dinosaur fossil area near Tumbler Ridge in northeast B.C. He said he found on the surface bones from meat-eating and plant-eating dinosaurs, leading him to speculate there is much more just under the surface.
McCrea, who operates on a $152,000 annual grant from the municipal government in Tumbler Ridge, said a local helicopter company is flying him to the remote site this week where he plans to spend Thanksgiving weekend taking a deeper look at his potential find.

Motivation
The annual Pinewood Derby in my Cub Scout troop was always an exciting time for my friends and me growing up. Just look how happy I am in this amazing digital photo composition that my dad put together using Microsoft PictureIt! 99:
Hey man, it was 1999. We're lucky it was digital at all.
There are a few important things to note about this picture. Firstly, I'm in first place. Obviously. Secondly, there are only three cars racing. This is because our track was a terrible hand-built wooden number, and the 4th lane was known to give an unfair advantage to the racer.
Pinewood Derbies have changed a lot since then. Tracks are now better crafted and have electronic systems to measure track times down to the millisecond. There are even services available where you can hire a team to set up a professional pinewood derby track for your event.
My office does exactly this every year.
Last year, I used my CNC mill to aid me a little bit in carving out my car:
Okay, maybe a little more than a little bit. Sadly, because I had to use five blocks to make this monster, the car came in way above the 5oz weight limit even after I removed a bunch of material from the bottom:
This means it had to race in the “unlimited” class along with a boot, my cousin's Volvo, and a slug of steel turned down to two razor sharp wheels that suffered some stability problems halfway down the track:
I managed to win this particular heat, but I ultimately didn't take home gold.
This year, I wanted to try something different. Unlike my scout troop's hand-painted track, these new fancy tracks are made from aluminum. By exploiting a little physics, I was hoping to give myself the upper hand.
Induction motors (the easy explanation)
Brushed DC motors are great for small electronics due to how easy they are to operate (just apply a DC voltage and away you go), but when it comes to large industrial machines, their brushed contacts can wear out quickly, and their permanent magnets can be expensive.
That's what makes induction motors so great! They contain nothing but steel and wire, can be controlled fairly easily, and in the case of stationary machines, they can be driven directly off three phase power from the wall.
The simplest way to describe how an induction motor works is using the old copper pipe and magnet trick.
Due to Faraday's law, a changing magnetic field through a loop of wire will cause a current to flow in that wire. In this case, the solid surface of the copper pipe acts like little loops of wire, and “eddy currents” are generated in this surface. These eddy currents in turn generate a magnetic field (Ampere's law) which opposes motion in the magnet. Generally speaking, loops of wire (inductors) really really don't like it when magnetic fields change magnitude or direction and they generate a current or a force to try to prevent this.
Now, if you look at this copper pipe example, you can imagine that by connecting a string to the magnet and holding it steady, you could also show that the pipe would fall slowly down around the magnet. Taking it one step further, if you were to suddenly jerk the magnet upwards, you could potentially get the copper pipe to move upwards as well. It wouldn't go as fast as the magnet, but it would still move in the same direction. If you were to fix the magnet to a spinning disk (the stator) and place that disk near a copper disk (the rotor), the copper disk would rotate.
This is more or less how an induction motor works, but rather than physically moving a magnet around, a series of electromagnets are pulsed in a sequence to keep the magnetic fields rotating. Also, instead of a copper disk, real induction motors use coils of copper wire in their rotor to improve their performance and efficiency.
Linear induction motors (the hard explanation)
So if brushed DC motors are so great for small electronic devices, why would I go with an induction motor for my car? Well, going into this experiment, I knew that the track was made from some kind of metal. I had a pretty good feeling that it wasn't steel, because a 30 foot long steel track would be a little ridiculous to carry around. It was probably aluminum.
Rather than arranging my motor to rotate the wheels, I wanted to use the track as my “rotor” and create a “linear induction motor.” This is a little counter-intuitive because in this case the stator (car) is moving while the rotor (track) is stationary. This configuration generates a force sort of like the force generated on the copper pipe in the thought experiment above.
Aluminum is a pretty good conductor like copper, and more importantly, unlike steel it's non-ferrous. When cut into specific shapes, steel is great for directing magnetic fields where you want them to go, but when in a solid block, it tends to dissipate them.
In its simplest form, my motor design looks like this.
The stator of my motor consists of a bunch of loops of wire wrapped around a saw-tooth shaped ferrite core which is there to help direct the magnetic fields towards the track. The top portion of the diagram is drawn looking up at the bottom of the car while the bottom portion gives a side view of the motor facing down towards the track.
The wire is wrapped in six loops that are connected in series into three separate “phases.” These phases are represented by the three colors. The little arrow on the loops at the top indicate the relative direction of the phases. If current is traveling in the direction of the arrow on one of the black loops, it's also traveling in the direction of the arrow on the other. Note that the direction reverses between two loops of the same color.
The left side of the diagram shows how the three phases are connected. This is called a “Wye” configuration (Wye goes along with “Poynting” as one of my favorite aptronyms). Basically, theres a single point where all three phases connect. The other side of the three phases connect to whatever is driving the circuit. In the case of a large industrial induction motor, this may be connected directly to three phase power. In my case, I built a little driver for it, but more on that later.
Now let's try firing this guy up to see what happens. First I'm going to push current into the black phase and out of the red phase.
As you can see, the red and black phases overlap and their currents are moving the same direction (this is because the current is moving opposite the direction of the arrow in the red phase).
Next up, let's switch to down black and out blue:
Here's where things get a little weird. As you can see, shifting the motor phase has the effect of moving all of the magnetic fields one notch to the left. This is where Lorentz forces come into play.
The Lorentz Force says that when a charge is moving with some velocity through a magnetic field, it will feel a force in the direction of the cross product of its velocity and the field (i.e. point fingers of right hand in velocity direction, curl in field direction, thumb is in direction of force).
The important thing is that for that equation to work, the charge's velocity has to be defined relative to the field. In this case, because the field is moving to the left, the math works out as if the charge is moving to the right through a stationary field. If you apply the right-hand rule, you'll see that the charge will begin to form currents in the the rotor in the directions indicated in purple. A circle with an X indicates that the charge is moving into the page while a circle and a dot indicates it moving out of the page.
Finally, focus on one of these currents and run the right-hand rule again.
You can see that a force will act on our charge that pushes it in the direction of the moving magnetic field. This is more or less what we expect from our thought experiment with the rotating permanent magnet.
The phases of the motor continue to be energized in this manner for all six possible configurations and then start over:
If you work out each phase, you'll see a general pattern of North and South poles moving in sequence over time.
If the motor had absolutely no friction or load on it, eventually the relative velocity of the charges in the rotor and the magnetic field would be zero and the force would drop to zero. Realistically, this never happens and there is always some amount of lag or “slip.” The amount of slip present determines the amount of torque generated by the motor.

Banking
Getting paid with checks is a pain in the ass. I hate going to the bank more than I hate tofu burgers. Ok that's a lie, tofu isn't that bad. There's nothing worse than when you're in a hurry or have to be on a conference call in 30 minutes, and you had planned plenty of time to go to the bank, but the line is so backed up it takes 14 f'n hours to get through to deposit your one lousy check. I don't like to make fun of old people, I love old people, but the old lady counting coins one by one was the best symbolism for a long slow line I could come up with. A long line isn't frustrating because you've prepared yourself for the wait, you can pull out your cell phone and browse reddit for a while to pass the time. When you've been in line for 30 minutes, and you're next in the queue, but the person in front of you is getting too chatty and forgetting to sign every thing ever… I feel like the flash here.
My goal this past weekend was to delve into off-trail adventures in an area I know relatively well. I wanted to hike up Salmon Butte which is about 3000 ft of elevation gain and then take an unmaintained trail down the other side. At some point, I would then venture west along a ridgeline (Rondthaler Mountain) and eventually up to Hambone Butte. I planned to camp at a spring near Hambone Butte. Then the next day I planned to bushwhack down to some falls that are difficult to reach from the other side of the Salmon River Canyon. I would then attempt to cross the Salmon River and link up to the well-used trail on the other side to return home. Seemed simple enough. This trip was also my chance to test out both the IKEA Backpacking Poncho and my MYOG Synthetic Quilt in real conditions.
I did get a chance to field test my IKEA 6.7oz poncho. As I started the trail it was POURING. I purposely packed only my IKEA poncho, forcing me to try it in real conditions. My pack “liner” was a kitchen garbage bag that I put my extra layers and sleeping gear into. I left my actual rain gear and pack cover at home, so I would have no choice at the last minute to balk at using the IKEA poncho.
The poncho is a pain in the ass to get on. I put my pack on first, then put on the poncho. Maybe the opposite method is better? Being alone, I had nobody to help get it over the back of my pack. I eventually was able to do it, but it was a total pain in the ass. The poncho kept me dry and functioned as intended. No real issues with its performance to be honest. I wore it for roughly an hour until it stopped raining.
When I took it off, I took a look at the seams. They are taped shut. However the construction is horrific and I could even see pinholes in the fabric near the seams. It looked like the stitching job on my MYOG quilt. While it looks like shit, it did work to my surprise. However, in extended rains I believe it would definitely fail and leak. This is not a durable product made for hardcore use. That being said I'll pack it along in warm weather when Im expecting rain. This will be my go-to until it's unusable.
I slogged up 3000 ft, slowly. I was hungry by the time I summited. I easily found the “unmaintained” trail which was much better than some maintained trails I have been on. On this trail I saw the biggest pile of bear shit I've ever seen. At this point, I was tired and hungry and about to embark on my first off-trail segment. However, the brush and vegetation were insane. It would take me forever to go off trail the way I had planned. I saw that if I only went another mile or so on the trail I was on, there was a 4×4 road I could hike for 2.5 miles that would bring me to my intended camping spot. I just couldn't resist the efficiency off staying on trail and on the 4×4 road.
The rest of the trail and the 4×4 road were really quite beautiful. I was still up pretty high, so I looked down onto another valley that contained GIGANTIC old growth. Even from up high, I could see thousands of old growth trees towering above the rest of the forest. It was really something to see. I saw only some bike tracks on the road and I wondered if it was closed off to vehicles.
Eventually I made it to the campsite. It was basically an older NFS campground left to rot, but still useable. Now I had to find that spring to fill up. Using my GPS on my phone I bushwhacked through thick rhododendron which took FOREVER. It must've taken me 20 minutes to go an 1/8 of a mile, or less. I reached the spring, filled up and walked straight up the hill and wouldn't you know it THERE WAS A GODDAMN TRAIL LEADING RIGHT TO IT. I just bushwhacked for nothing.
However, bushwhacking was the whole point of the trip. After struggling through the dense rhododendron area and seeing nothing else, I decided that I wanted no part of doing that for upwards of 4 miles the next day until I could link up with another trail. I also realized that the Salmon river this time of year is still roaring and crossing would be quite dangerous. Even if I bushwhacked through the dense vegetation, found the wateralls I was looking for, and made it to where I wanted to cross; there was no guarantee I could safely cross. And then I would have to completely backtrack the entire route.
So as I ate my beans and rice with crunched up nachos and drank an IPA, I knew I had a decision to make. I could take the risk, bushwhack and see what the river had in store for me, or I could turn back the next morning and come back a day early. I studied my maps and crashed out. It was getting cold and my feet/socks were wet from the hike.
My Adidas goretex equipped trail shoes which I bought because they didn't aggravate my Plantar Fasciitis, wetted out just like all “waterproof breathable” gear will do. I left my socks on and wore them to bed, because this is what will dry them out. Leaving them out overnight only gives you cold damp socks the next morning.
Now was the time to test out my new MYOG quilt. I made it with 3.6oz Apex Climashield insulation, which I read was supposed to be warm down to 40 degrees F, which I was skeptical of. The forecast was for 41, so I figured this was the perfect opportunity to test it. I packed a sweater just in case and was very glad I did.
My feet were toasty the whole night despite starting off wet. By morning my socks were dry. However, I made this quilt for using in “summer” conditions. We are not quite there yet where I live. I didn't make the quilt with straps to connect it to the pad because I figured I wouldn't need it in the summer and would mostly just use it like a blanket. As a result it was drafty around my hips and ass, cooling me off when I didn't want to be. I slept horribly.
I wasn't freezing per se, just uncomfortable. I had on all of my clothing, base layers, pants, shirt, and a thick wool sweater. For me the 3.6oz Climashield is probably better for a low of down to 50 degrees or so. I sleep cold so this isn't surprising to me.
I awoke at 530 AM, which means broad daylight this time of year. First visible light starts after 4AM or so. I got up and made goat milk oatmeal, had my coffee and decided against the long bushwhack. It just didn't seem worth it at this point. Studying my map I saw some other possible future routes that may be better for another trip.
I was kinda bummed out but decided just to enjoy the hike back and was happy to have had the opportunity to try out both the IKEA poncho and my new quilt. I realized I was a little overambitious in my planning. Later in the season this is feasible and from a different point of entry this trip would be a whole other story. Lesson learned and I'll be back without a doubt.
Vice President Mike Pence held the district before running for governor in 2012. | Carlos Giusti/AP Photo Filing shows Pence's brother readying House campaign
A new federal tax filing indicates that Vice President Mike Pence's brother, Greg, is preparing to launch a campaign for Congress in Indiana.
An operative with ties to Vice President Pence and Rep. Luke Messer, who is leaving his House seat to run for Senate, filed paperwork with the IRS this week to form "Greg Pence for Congress Inc." “for purposes of conducting a campaign in 2018 for the election of Greg Pence as United State Representative in Indiana.”
Story Continued Below
Greg Pence has been weighing a run for Congress in Messer's 6th District for months. Pence, a businessman, has appeared at his brother's side as he ran for office but would be new to political office himself. Greg Pence has already been deeply involved in Indiana politics this year through his work for Messer. He is serving as the chairman of Messer's Senate finance committee and starred in a video announcing Messer's Senate bid.
Vice President Pence held the district before running for governor in 2012. The Pence family's history in the 6th District, combined with Greg Pence's ties to a national political and fundraising network through his brother, would make Pence a formidable candidate, Indiana operatives say.

Indiana operative Craig Kunkle, who has ties to both Mike Pence and Messer, is listed as the contact and custodian of records for the new committee. Kunkle is part of MO Strategies, a firm started by longtime Mike Pence aide Marty Obst. Kunkle is also a former campaign treasurer for Messer.
A Pence consultant did not respond to a request for comment.
Though he would be the biggest name in the race, other Republicans have already launched bids for the 6th District while Pence was considering his options, including state Sen. Mike Crider.
Fresh off the triumphant finale to their unforgettable 2016 world tour in front of more than 110,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome, Japanese pop-metal sensation BABYMETAL will embark on a new adventure with an original shortform series from Warner Bros.' digital studio Blue Ribbon Content and Japanese powerhouse Amuse Inc.'s subsidiary Amuse USA. Manager and creator of BABYMETAL, Key Kobayashi (a.k.a. Kobametal) is also producing. The hybrid live-action and animated project is currently in development, it was announced today by Sam Register, president, Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series.
Sam Register said: "BABYMETAL have to be seen to be believed — a mind-blowing, fun combination of pop vocals, heavy metal music and dance choreography brought to life by three incredibly talented teenage stars. We are huge fans here at Blue Ribbon Content and are extremely excited to help bring the BABYMETAL phenomenon to U.S. audiences through this upcoming digital series."
Tatsuro Hatanaka, president, Amuse, Inc. and Amuse USA, commented: "We are grateful for Warner Bros. and Blue Ribbon Content's interest in BABYMETAL, and to be moving onward with the project. We are very much looking forward to working on this project with Sam and his team, and hope everyone will enjoy our completed work."
The action-adventure will take viewers inside the magical world of heavy metal music as it comes under attack, and one lonely god, Kitsune, forms the warrior band BABYMETAL to save the day. In the series, Su-Metal, Yuimetal and Moametal join together to ultimately redefine the genre. The series will also feature new live-action performances from the group, who will enter the animated world through a secret portal.
Fronted by three teenage girls with choreographed dance moves to accompany their vocals, BABYMETAL is making waves in the music industry with two chart-topping albums that have solidified the Japanese pop-metal band's cross-continent success. In fact, the buzz-worthy group recently caught the attention of the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, who are taking them on their first U.K. tour in five years.
With a name inspired by "the birth of new metal" and a goal of fusing metal and pop music, the BABYMETAL lineup includes Su-Metal, Yuimetal and Moametal. BABYMETAL has already achieved two major debut singles, both of which ranked in the Top 10 Oricon chart in Japan. Their first studio album also earned the #1 spot on Billboard's World Album chart, and the official live music video for their debut album's lead single, "Gimme Chocolate!!", has garnered more than 60 million views on YouTube. Their sophomore album, "Metal Resistance", made them the first Japanese act to make The Billboard 200 album chart's top 40 in 53 years. They have also won several awards, including:
* The Breakthrough Act award at the 2015 Metal Hammer Golden Gods
* The Spirit of Independence award at the 2015 Kerrang! Awards
* MTV Europe's Wildcard Best Japanese Act
* The Discovery Prize at GQ Japan's Men of the Year 2015 Awards
* Women of the Year prize at Vogue Japan's Women of the Year 2015 Awards
* Best Live Act award at the 2016 Kerrang! Awards
* Best Live Act award at the 2016 AIM Independent Music Awards
Since its inception, the Japanese metal dance unit has developed a devoted fan base that describes their concerts as both energetic and unforgettable. The band has also received glowing praise from the industry's top acts, including SLIPKNOT's Corey Taylor, GUNS N' ROSES' Slash and Rob Zombie, who told Billboard that BABYMETAL "are like nothing I've ever seen before."
The new series will take their energy from the stage to the screen with a can't-miss adventure for all ages.
Everton are closing on a £1million deal for Sheffield United forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
The 19-year-old had a spell on loan at League Two Northampton last season before returning to Bramall Lane. He scored eight goals in 35 appearances across the 2015-16 campaign.
Calvert-Lewin made his Blades debut as a substitute in a 1-1 draw at Leyton Orient late in the 2014-15 season, having previously spent time on loan at National League North outfit Stalybridge Celtic, where he scored five goals.
Dominic Calvert-Lewin had a successful loan stint with Northampton last term and could cost Everton £1m
The teenager scored eight times for the team that won League Two, before he returned to Sheffield United
DOMINIC CALVERT-LEWIN, SO FAR July 2013: Signed trainee terms with Sheffield United 2014-15: Sheffield United: Appearances: 2 Goals: 0 Stalybridge Celtic: (loan), 4 (6) 2015-16: Sheffield United: 9 (0) Northampton Town: (loan), 26 (8)
The attacker spent the first half of last season at Sixfields Stadium, playing 26 times for the team that would eventually run away with the League Two title.
And despite Sheffield United now being managed by Chris Wilder, who was in charge at Northampton during Calvert-Lewin's spell with the club, the Blades face losing their homegrown star to the Merseyside giants.
The teenager would represent Everton's second signing on new boss Ronald Koeman's watch, following last week's capture of goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from Fulham.
Calvert-Lewin would become the latest additon to the highly-rated Under-21 set-up at Goodison Park
The Goodison Park club has nevertheless already been busy this summer adding to the ranks of its much vaunted youth set-up.
Calvert-Lewin is expected to join up with the Toffees' Under 21s, where his team-mates would include Bassala Sambou, the 18-year-old striker recruited from Coventry City, and goalkeeper Chris Renshaw, another 18-year-old, brought in from Oldham Athletic.
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Manufacturing in China and the United States grew this month at the fastest pace in about two years while data suggesting German growth picked up boosted hopes for a swifter euro zone recovery.
The business surveys released on Thursday provided tentative signs that the world economy may be gaining traction after a sluggish 2012. Crucially, there were hopeful signals coming from the United States and China, the world's top economies.
World stock markets rose, with the S&P 500 index moving above 1,500 for the first time since late 2007. The benchmark U.S. index was on track for its seventh straight daily advance. .N
China's vast factory sector grew at its fastest clip in two years this month, according to HSBC's flash China PMI. Exports were surprisingly strong in December, while analysts said an increase in domestic activity should also help drive recovery.
“The consumer is coming back,” said Tim Condon, an ING economist in Singapore. “Manufacturers are seeing the pick-up in spending growth as reason to expand production.”
Economists said that suggested the world's second largest economy was on the mend after some two years of slowing growth.
“Probably the biggest thing that will affect markets this year is one's belief in the sustainability of the Chinese recovery,” said Colin Moore, chief investment officer at Columbia Management in Boston, which oversees $340 billion.
U.S. manufacturing started the year strongly as well, as a surge in domestic demand led to the fastest rate of growth since March, 2011, according to financial information firm Markit's “flash” manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index.
Improved economic conditions in China and some parts of Europe also helped boost orders from abroad, the survey showed.
“However, it is the domestic market that is clearly providing the main impetus to the upturn,” said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson.
Briklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said both manufacturing and housing “need to show bigger improvement for quite some time to affect the broader economy.”
A separate report showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment insurance fell to its lowest level since the early days of the 2007-2009 recession.
HOPEFUL SIGNS IN EUROPE
The 17-country euro zone continues to lag Asia and North America, though surveys in January showed conditions may be improving there as well.
Markit's “flash” Composite Eurozone Purchasing Managers' Index, which surveys around 5,000 firms and is viewed as a good growth indicator, jumped by more than expected to 48.2 from December's 47.2.
PMI data for Germany, Europe's largest economy and the bloc's growth engine, suggested its economy grew at its fastest pace in a year. But in France, the euro zone's second biggest economy, conditions got worse.
“The improvement in euro zone PMIs might be just a German story, a sign that the euro zone economy is far from being out of the woods,” said Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy.
Indeed, the euro zone-wide index has held below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction in all but one of the past 17 months, consistent with a contraction in overall output at a quarterly rate of about 0.2-0.3 percent, Markit said.
But the pace of the contraction is slowing.
“At this stage the trajectory counts more than the absolute level, and here the main story is that the pace of recession is clearly easing,” said Marco Valli, chief euro zone economist at UniCredit.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi recently said the 17 countries that use the euro are benefiting from “positive contagion.”
“An end to the recession may not be far off. Indeed, today's data clearly support the view that Germany might lead the euro zone out of recession in the first of half of this year,” said Martin van Vliet at ING.
Germany's composite PMI rose to a 12-month high of 53.6 from December's 50.3.
The euro zone economy contracted in the second and third quarters of last year, meeting the general definition of recession. It is expected to have deepened at the end of 2012.
A Reuters poll published on Wednesday predicted a 0.4 percent contraction in the final months of 2012 and only a flat outlook for the current quarter. <ECILT/EU>

EYES ON ASIA
According to Reuters polls of more than 600 economists, recovering growth in Asia should help make up for political and economic malaise in more developed countries.<ECILT/WRAP>
HSBC said the sub-indices for output, new orders and employment that account for three quarters of the China flash PMI all improved in January.
“Despite still tepid external demand, the domestic-driven restocking process is likely to add steam to China's ongoing recovery in the coming months,” said Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC.
Declaring your team's most important player is not a simple thing. It's not always the most valuable guy or the highest points producer. It is the player who makes your team go; the one you can't afford to lose, even if all he contributes can't be measured by fancy stats.
Most Important Player: Ryan Getzlaf, Forward
Where Getzlaf goes, the Anaheim Ducks follow.
And if you were plotting a graph showing the ascension of the Ducks over the past three seasons, then one might presume that the next step is at least a berth in the Western Conference finals after three straight years of taking incremental steps deeper in the playoffs.
Getzlaf may not have the profile of other NHL captains like Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin or Jonathan Toews, but if you asked 100 hockey people to list the top five centers in the game, close to 100 would have Getzlaf on that list, maybe even the top three.
Getzlaf led the Ducks to their third straight Pacific Division crown last season with 70 points. Of his 25 goals, six were game winners and 13 either tied a game or gave the Ducks a lead. And Getzlaf has quietly evolved into a stellar two-way forward, finishing second among all forwards with 95 blocked shots and leading all Ducks forwards with 22:25 in average ice time per night in the playoffs.
Speaking of the playoffs, Getzlaf once again proved he is a postseason force, collecting 20 points in 16 games to best his own franchise record for postseason production as the Ducks bowed out in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals to the eventual Stanley Cup winners from Chicago.
In the past two playoff years, Getzlaf has picked up 35 points in 28 playoff games. Now, if we're going to quibble, we'll point out that in three straight years, the Ducks have been eliminated from the playoffs in a Game 7 and all of those games have been on home ice. In those three games, Getzlaf has three assists. Did we mention quibbling?
Still, when you are among the elite in the game, these are the moments that dog you if you aren't on the winning side of the ledger when it matters most.
Getzlaf was a young man when the Ducks won their first and only Stanley Cup in 2007. He and linemate Corey Perry both carry the burden of returning a strong Ducks team to the pinnacle -- sooner rather than later. Since that Cup win, both Getzlaf and Perry have acquired two Olympic gold medals with Canada in 2010 and 2014, and the pressure is mounting on the current edition of the Ducks to take the final steps to return the Cup to Anaheim. At age 30, Getzlaf (runner-up for the Hart Trophy as league MVP in 2014) is coming into his prime not just as a player but as the Ducks' captain -- a role he assumed in the fall of 2010 after Hall of Famer Scott Niedermayer retired.
As we noted, when Getzlaf goes, so go the Ducks; this is a theme we feel will likely be revisited often next May and June.

For eight years now, Alison Brie has been flexing her versatility as an actor across television and film. From shows such as Mad Men, Community, and Bojack Horseman to films like her impressive starring role in Leslye Headlund's upcoming Sleeping With Other People, Brie has proven herself to be as multitalented as she is hardworking.
As the defiant Trudy Campbell on Mad Men, we've seen Brie deliver her most dramatic performances—something we'll be sad to miss as the show begins its final season this Sunday. To give you a taste of Brie's experience on the show, we're pleased to share a preview of forthcoming feature on her in the upcoming Spring issue of the newly relaunched BlackBook Magazine.
Having been on Mad Men for nearly a decade, how does it feel now that the show is coming to an end?
It was totally incredible to be a part of Mad Men from the first season to the last. I can't believe I got to stay on the show the whole time. It will forever inform all other work that I do. It was my first real acting job after college, outside of regional theater, and it taught me so much about nuance. It was like a clinic for acting in a television drama, with Matthew Weiner as professor.
I just feel very grateful that I got to be on it for so long. It taught me a lot about stillness and subtext—all that stuff I learned about in college studying theater, but now having to apply it differently when it relates to film and TV. Shooting an episode of Mad Men really feels like shooting a movie, you know? The things I've learned on the show, and also the work ethic and professionalism, have come with me into every other job.
Did you find it difficult to juggle such disparate roles as Annie on Community and Trudy on Mad Men?
I feel like for three seasons the shows would shoot simultaneously. There were days where I'd literally shoot Community in the morning and then drive over and shoot Mad Men in the evening. It was an awesome exercise, but not difficult because the shows are so different; so it's really easy to go from one to the other and not confuse the two. Putting on the Mad Men wardrobe alone I feel like I'm totally transformed into that era, into that character, because the costume design is specific and well done that it was easy. If they'd been super similar, it would have been more of a challenge, whereas this just felt like…I'm living a dream!
It's always nice to have some downtime amidst craziness, but at the same time I find it hard to not infuse a little bit of myself into every character I play, probably because you are the same set of skin and bones and vocal cords every time. Also, as much as I really respect the work and all that, I also think it's fun! We're playing make believe at the end of the day. I try to take it seriously in the moment, so I'm just connecting between.
With both of your long-term shows ending, is it freeing to know that now your career is wide open for new projects? You're already taking on such varied roles in film and TV.
It's been very exciting, and kind of relief. It's interesting having worked on Mad Men for seven years and Community for six years, looking at these two shows coming to an end, there's always the nervousness of like, will I ever work again? I've been doing these things for so long. So it was really amazing to spend the last year cultivating some other stuff, some other sides of myself, and being able to do some awesome film work. It's really great to hear you say that I take on different roles because I definitely do, and it's not always easy. I've been very lucky to have been afforded opportunities to work on some characters that are different and projects that are different.
Most of your upcoming movies are comedies with an edge—do you want to continue down that route or pursue more dramatic roles as well?
I definitely still want to pursue drama. I've definitely felt the withdrawal of Mad Men being over, not having that drama fix. I love drama, I love thrillers, so I would still like to look for work in that genre.

A lightning-ignited wildfire has burned more than 3,000 acres on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, national park officials said Thursday.
The Fuller Fire is burning in the area north of Fuller Canyon Road and about 3 miles southwest of Point Imperial. It is feeding on dead and downed logs on the forest floor and aspen-tree regeneration in an area burned by the 2000 Outlet Fire. That fire burned more than 14,000 acres.
The Fuller Fire is estimated to have grown to about 3,057 acres after it was started by lightning on June 29. About 200 crew members have been working to extinguish the fire.
Crews have been supported by bulldozer operations, helicopters dropping water and one heavy air tanker dropping retardant. Engine crews have worked on holding the fire north and west of the Point Imperial Road. Officials said fire behavior is expected to moderate overnight, with creeping and smoldering fire activity.
On Friday, officials said crews will continue active suppression efforts to contain all spot fires and to help contain fire to the south as opportunities arise.

Officials said smoke is visible from State Route 67 and the North Rim, Marble Canyon, Cameron and the South Rim. Winds from the west and southwest are expected to continue to move smoke toward the east and northeast. Because of this, officials ask the public not to participate in outdoor activities or exercise if they see smoke.
Officials said the projected fire growth will continue to the north, south and east until monsoonal moisture returns to the area. Fire managers are using a full range of actions to direct or minimize the spread of fire as needed, officials said.

More than 1,000 people rallied in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 30 to protest President Donald Trump's first travel ban. Challenges to the revised version of the ban are expected to end up before the high court. Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
The Trump administration filed notice Friday that it plans to appeal a preliminary injunction issued this week in Maryland, and it's widely expected to do the same in Hawaii. But no matter the outcome before the federal appeals courts, experts agree that the matter will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
"It's a matter of extreme national importance and implicates the scope of executive authority and important constitutional principles," says Cristina Rodriguez, a professor at Yale Law School specializing in constitutional and immigration law. "Even if the courts are all uniform, the Supreme Court will want to hear it."
There are some variables along the way – most notably, whether Congress confirms Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court before the justices hear arguments in the case.
Here's what's happened so far and what lies ahead:
What happened in the rulings this week?
The executive order was scheduled to take effect on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time. Hours before it did, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii issued a temporary restraining order halting two of its core provisions: a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program and a 90-day halt on entries by most citizens of six majority-Muslim nations: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland issued a preliminary injunction that also stopped the 90-day provision.
Other aspects of the executive order, such as a sharp reduction in the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the U.S., were allowed to take effect.
What are the main arguments?
Hawaii, which brought the case that won the temporary restraining order, has argued that the executive order amounts to religious discrimination against Muslims, particularly in light of statements by the president and his advisers about seeking at least a temporary ban on allowing Muslims into the U.S.
It has also contended that the travel restrictions harm its universities, its business and tourist economy, and its local residents. A local imam, who's mother-in-law lives in Syria and would appear to be affected by the travel ban, also joined the state's lawsuit.
The case in Maryland was brought by two refugee support and advocacy groups, as well as a handful of individuals. They, too, argued that the executive order discriminates against Muslims. They also contended that it would harm people who live in the U.S. – even if they themselves are not directly affected by the restrictions – because it would prevent family members from visiting.
The Trump administration, by contrast, has contended that the order amounts to no more than a pause to review immigration security screening procedures, an act they argue is well within the scope of the president's authority. Justice Department lawyers vigorously argued that the order is not discriminatory and that it was motivated by national security concerns.
What's the government going to do?
With the restraining order and preliminary injunction in place, the Trump administration had three options: File an immediate appeal in the 4th and 9th circuits and seek hearings on an emergency basis as early as possible; decide not to appeal, let the restraining order and injunction remain, and eventually go to trial on the merits of whether the executive order is legal; or withdraw and either start over or give up.
No one expected the third option. And after Trump's fiery rhetoric at a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, on Wednesday night, few, if any, expected the second. And with the filing Friday in the case in Maryland, the Justice Department is signaling it plans to fight on.
The Justice Department subsequently filed a request for clarification in the Hawaii case, asking Judge Watson whether his temporary restraining order applied to every facet of sections 2 and 6 of the executive order – the sections containing the 120-day suspension of refugee resettlement and 90-day restriction on entry by citizens of certain nations – or only certain parts of those sections.
An appeal to a circuit would be heard by a panel of three judges, as was the Justice Department appeal of the Trump administration's original order restricting travel. In that case, the 9th Circuit upheld the district court judge's ruling and the administration opted to rewrite its order. If this order is similarly decided in the appeals courts, the administration could ask the circuits for "en banc" hearings – rehearings of the cases before the full complement of circuit court judges – or appeal directly to the Supreme Court.
Will Gorsuch be nominated before either case reaches the Supreme Court?
Probably. Confirmation hearings begin next week, and Gorsuch is expected to be confirmed, meaning he will likely be on the bench in as soon as a month – more than enough time for the arguments over the restraining order and preliminary injunction to wind their way to the Supreme Court.
That said, there is a chance that the appeals – if sought and granted on an emergency basis by the appeals court and then the Supreme Court – could arrive at the high court earlier, but it's not likely. And even if it did, the justices might not be eager to take up a case of this magnitude with the potential of a deadlock.
"If the justices split 4-4, that could have negative repercussions for the court and its credibility, or for the nation for it to be seen as unresolved," Rodriguez says.
So if Gorsuch gets confirmed in time and the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, what is expected to happen?
It could be a nail-biter, but opponents of the travel ban face some hurdles.
For one, the Supreme Court has often been reluctant to second-guess the president's decisions in immigration.
"Traditionally courts have been deferential to presidents and Congress on immigration matters because immigration involves national sovereignty and foreign relations and terrorism concerns," even when there are First Amendment concerns like religious discrimination, says Stephen Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School.
In the 1972 case in Kleindienst v. Mandel, for example, the Supreme Court rejected arguments that the government's decision to bar a Belgian Marxist from entering the U.S. for a speaking tour violated the First Amendment rights of U.S. citizens who would have met and spoken with him. The court in that case concluded that the executive branch had the authority to refuse an individual's entry to the U.S.
Trump's executive order, however, is far larger in scope. And while Gorsuch's expected confirmation will add another conservative vote to the court, that doesn't make the case an easy win for the administration.
"This is such new territory and such broad use of that power," says Phil Torrey, a lecturer at Harvard Law School who specializes in criminal and immigration law.
There's also the issue of standing – essentially, whether the groups and individuals who brought the challenges are eligible to do so based on how they'd be affected by the executive order. For instance, Hawaii's argument that its economy would be harmed by the travel restrictions could be seen as speculative by a higher court, and many of the claims brought by individuals relate not to their ability to travel but their family members' admissibility to the U.S.
"The standing issue is really interesting and a potential land mine," Rodriguez says. "That's a way the court could get rid of the case without addressing the trickier constitutional question."
Finally, the decisions by Judges Watson and Chuang in Hawaii and Maryland drew heavily from remarks that Trump and his associates made both before and after the election about Muslims and whether the revised travel ban would be substantially different from the first. The justices could decide to give those statements less weight, seeing them less than policy statements than off-the-cuff remarks.
For example, a dissent written by members of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals over whether a full en banc panel of the court should rehear arguments on Trump's original travel ban – frozen since Feb. 3 – argued that the statements were not relevant.
"Context really matters, and these statements are really relevant to what the government's intent was with the order, but it would worry me that speech made in the political arena in a fashion could constrain the executive, because hyperbolic things get said, so holding the president to too tight a standard in relation to his speech could potentially be problematic in the future," Rodriguez says.
1. Ryan Tannehill
2014 was a career season for Tannehill. He had career highs in passing yards, rushing yards, touchdowns, and QBR. In 2015, the Dolphins made their receiving corps better by drafting DeVante Parker, who will pair well with Jarvis Landry and tight end Jordan Cameron. Miami also gets left tackle Branden Albert back from injury, which means Tannehill will actually have a little time in the pocket. It all adds up to 2015 being Tannehill's breakout year.
2. Eddie Lacy
When you play with Aaron Rodgers, you're going to be a perpetual afterthought. Rodgers and the Packers passing offense were sensational in 2014, but hardly at the expense of the ground game. While Rodgers amassed 4,381 passing yards and 38 touchdowns by air, Lacy managed 1,139 and nine touchdowns in his sophomore season in the NFL. Now, Lacy is entering the prime of his career backed by one the league's best quarterbacks. It isn't a question of whether his numbers jump up, it's a question of how high.
3. Andre Johnson
Andre Johnson is old and his stats and former team would tell you he's on the decline. After 12 seasons with the Houston Texans, Johnson is now an Indianapolis Colt and paired with Andrew Luck. You or I could probably catch a touchdown or two as Andrew Luck's receiver. Johnson isn't your or I, he's one of the NFL's most consistent receivers. Factor T.Y. Hilton into the mix, and you begin to realize just how open Johnson will be this season.
4. Alfred Morris
Morris is the lone bright spot on a crushingly dreary team. The Redskins are well on their way to being the worst team in the NFL in 2015 as Robert Griffin III suffered a concussion in the team's second preseason game. But if there is going to be any shine – or offense – Morris will be responsible. He's managed over 1,000 yards in everyone one his first three years behind a worthless offensive line. It's not going to be pretty, but it'll be the only watchable thing in Washington.
5. Mike Evans
Evans spent his rookie season playing for a terrible team with a mediocre quarterback. He caught 1,051 yards and 12 touchdowns for that terrible team. He enters his second season still playing for a pretty bad team but now he has the No. 1 draft pick as his quarterback. Jameis Winston and Evans are the best thing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have going for them and when all is said and done, could prove to be one of the most powerful offensive partnerships in the NFL.
Linking physical traits to criminality may sound like a throwback to the biological determinism advocated by 19th-century social Darwinists who believed that there was a genetic predisposition for wrongdoing. Practitioners are quick to distance themselves from such ideas.
Mr. Price, for example, argues that crime can be viewed, at least partly, as an “alternative labor market.” If individuals with certain physical attributes are disadvantaged in the labor force, they may find crime more attractive, he said.
H. Naci Mocan, an economist at Louisiana State University and an author of a paper on crime and attractiveness, explained that theories about the relationship between weight, height or beauty and the labor force emerged because “economists looking at standard determinants — like education, experience, productivity, human capital — found that they could only explain some of the variation in wages.”
“This is very new,” Mr. Mocan said of the research into crime. “It opens up our horizons a little more.”
A link between a physical attribute and salary, or crime, does not necessarily mean cause and effect. Mr. Mocan pointed out that we do not know why someone who is overweight, unattractive or short is at a disadvantage in the labor market or more likely to commit a crime. It could be employer discrimination, customer preference or that the physical attribute may make the worker less productive. If a job involves carrying heavy loads, for instance, brawn would be an advantage.
That is what both Howard Bodenhorn, an economist at Clemson University, and Mr. Price concluded from 19th-century prison records. In that era increased body weight was associated with a lower risk of crime. In the 21st century, though, in which service jobs are much more common, Mr. Price found that being overweight was linked to a higher risk of crime.
Mr. Mocan and Erdal Tekin, an economist at Georgia State University, analyzed data from a national survey of adolescent health that involved 15,000 high school students who were interviewed in 1994, 1996 and 2002. They found that being unattractive in high school was correlated with a lower grade point average, more problems with teachers and suspensions.

Other studies have found that shorter students tend to participate less frequently in clubs and sports. As a result these students may suffer a drop in self-esteem or not develop certain kinds of social skills that are useful later in life, the two economists theorized.

According to their study, both men and women who were rated unattractive (as rated on a five-point scale) in high school were more likely to commit — or at least more likely to be caught while committing — one of seven crimes, including burglary and selling drugs, than those rated average or attractive.
Mr. Price said anthropometric economics was based on the work of economic historians — including the Nobel Prize-winner Robert Fogel, John Komlos at the University of Munich and Richard H. Steckel at Ohio State University — who have used height and weight to assess changing social conditions.
Since biologists believe that 80 percent of height is determined by genetics and 20 percent by environmental conditions, height — and sometimes weight — can be an index of childhood nutrition, health care and exposure to disease. Thus smaller stature may be a sign of an impoverished upbringing.
Mr. Komlos, for example, wrote a 2007 paper with Benjamin E. Lauderdale that found that Americans were the “tallest in the world between colonial times and the middle of the 20th century,” but have since “become shorter (and fatter) than Western and Northern Europeans. In fact, the United States population is currently at the bottom end of the height distribution in advanced industrial countries.”
“We conjecture,” they concluded, “that the United States health-care system, as well as the relatively weak welfare safety net, might be why human growth in the United States has not performed as well in relative terms as one would expect on the basis of income alone.”
Though beauty would superficially seem to be in the same category as weight and height, studies that assess the economic advantage of being attractive are actually quite different, said Christina Paxson, an economist at Princeton who has studied the relationship between stature and status. While height is a sign of health and social conditions, the impact of beauty is more psychological, she said. There the question is how someone's perception of a worker's productivity, skill and talent is influenced by looks.
Mr. Price has suggested that there may be policy implications in his work, saying, “Public health policies successful at reducing obesity among individuals in the population will not only make society healthier, but also safer.”
At the moment, Mr. Mankiw is skeptical of any real-world utility. “Economists love quantifying things,” he said, “but there are so many possible interpretations, it doesn't settle debates as much as it opens up questions.”
He did note that his students at Harvard have been particularly fascinated by the research that shows quantifiable economic advantages of beauty. The benefit of these “weird facts,” he said, is that it “forces you to think about the world in ways you didn't before.”
This article is about several ancient Egyptian books. For the book by Aleister Crowley, see The Book of Thoth (Crowley)
Book of Thoth is a name given to many ancient Egyptian texts supposed to have been written by Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge. They include many texts that were claimed to exist by ancient authors, and a magical book that appears in an Egyptian work of fiction.
Texts that are known or claimed to exist [ edit ]
The Egyptians stored many texts, on a wide range of subjects, in "Houses of Life", the libraries contained within temple complexes. As Thoth was the god of knowledge, many of these texts were claimed to be his work.[1] The Egyptian historian Manetho said that Thoth wrote 36,525 books.[2]
The church father Clement of Alexandria, in the sixth book of his work Stromata, mentions forty-two books used by Egyptian priests that he says contain "the whole philosophy of the Egyptians". All these books, according to Clement, were written by Hermes (a pre-existing Greek god that the Greeks likened to Thoth, claiming they were one and the same god, having similar qualities, e.g. both invented writing). Translation from Egyptian language and concepts to Greek language and concepts was not entirely accurate and some of the Egyptian authenticity was lost. Among the subjects they cover are hymns, rituals, temple construction, astrology, geography, and medicine.[3]
The Egyptologists Richard Lewis Jasnow and Karl-Theodor Zauzich have dubbed a long Egyptian text from the Ptolemaic period "the Book of Thoth". This Demotic text, known from more than forty fragmentary copies, consists of a dialogue between a person called "The-one-who-loves-knowledge" and a figure that Jasnow and Zauzich identify as Thoth. The topics of their conversation include the work of scribes, various aspects of the gods and their sacred animals, and the Duat, the realm of the dead.[4]
Fictional book [ edit ]
The fictional Book of Thoth appears in an ancient Egyptian short story from the Ptolemaic period, known as "Setne Khamwas and Naneferkaptah" or "Setne I". The book, written by Thoth, is said to contain two spells, one of which allows the reader to understand the speech of animals, and one of which allows the reader to perceive the gods themselves.[5]
According to the story, the book was originally hidden at the bottom of the Nile near Coptos, where it was locked inside a series of boxes guarded by serpents. The Egyptian prince Neferkaptah fought the serpents and retrieved the book, but in punishment for his theft from Thoth, the gods killed his wife Ahwere and son Merib. Neferkaptah committed suicide and was entombed along with the book. Generations later, the story's protagonist, Setne Khamwas (a character based on the historical prince Khaemwaset), steals the book from Neferkaptah's tomb despite opposition from Neferkaptah's ghost. Setne then meets a beautiful woman who seduces him into killing his children and humiliating himself in front of the pharaoh. He discovers that this episode was an illusion created by Neferkaptah, and in fear of further retribution, Setne returns the book to Neferkaptah's tomb. At Neferkaptah's request, Setne also finds the bodies of Neferkaptah's wife and son and buries them in Neferkaptah's tomb, which is then sealed.[6]
The story reflects the Egyptian belief that the gods' knowledge is not meant for humans to possess.[7]
In popular culture [ edit ]
The Book of Thoth is often featured in fiction with Egyptian or supernatural themes. Novels that do so include Brood of the Witch-Queen (1918) by Sax Rohmer; Moses, Man of the Mountain (1938) by Zora Neale Hurston; Mumbo Jumbo (1972) by Ishmael Reed; The Rosetta Key (2008) by William Dietrich; and The Serpent's Shadow (2012) by Rick Riordan. The Book plays a role in Henry H. Neff's juvenile fantasy series The Tapestry and Lynne Ewing's young adult series Sisters of Isis.
In the third arc of the manga (and anime) JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, the antagonist Boingo's supernatural ability is named Thoth and takes the form of a fortune-telling comic book. In the Japanese novel (and anime) Myriad Colors Phantom World, the protagonist has an ability called "The Book of Thoth".
The Book of Thoth also appears in video games. For example, it is a side-quest element in Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey. In both the multi-player online battle arena Smite and Board Game Online, the Book of Thoth is a usable item. Also in Sid Meier's Civilization 6 it is present as a holy relic that generates faith and tourism.
The Book of Toth and the tomb of Nefer-Ka-Ptah also are animated in the little movie The riddle of the sphinx, directed by the Ukraïnan director Vladimir Pekar (1985).

We know a great many of you are knee deep in Web Development projects as we write this, and any time we have the opportunity to pass on some expert insights and resources, we don't hesitate to do so. Today, we have an awesome post from Rohit Boggarapu, who is a software engineer at Adobe. He's written a great article about charting and data visualization tools for web developers, and we encourage you to read it, as it's got some great information.
The gap between data and our interpretation of it can be huge, especially when it means squinting at rows of unintelligible figures in spreadsheets (possibly the least appealing format of all time).
Web developers don't really get along with spreadsheets. Now, they no longer have to, for there are far sexier ways to chart data. Yes, the necessary evil that was the static Excel chart isn't the only option any more.
There are many things to consider when choosing the right charting tool for your project. In this article, I'll be giving you a direct rundown of 12 of the best charting tools for web developers to help you stop struggling against data and start graphing.
Google Charts
The huge library of information available with Google Charts makes it a fantastic starting point for anyone looking to get started charting with JavaScript. The documentation has heaps of commented code and step-by-step instructions you can use to embed HTML5 / SVG charts into your web pages.
If you're looking for advanced customization and more charts than Google's native 18, below a—re some better options with more types and features.
Best for: Serious developers looking for a flexible, well-documented solution.
MetricsGraphics
MetricsGraphics is a charting library built on D3.js but optimized for visualizing and laying out time-series data. Although it is restricted to just line charts, scatterplots, bar charts, histograms and data tables, it does these few things incredibly well.
Similar to Google Charts (Metrics Graphics is a Mozilla product), there are tons of useful documentation and example code on their site, making it easy for beginners to dive in.
While it is a simplified solution, it's lightweight and quickly learned, thanks to a fun, interactive example that they provide (UFO sightings, eh?).
Best for: Developers who want a quick, beautiful solution without wading through a mess of code to get there.
FusionCharts
FusionCharts supports vanilla JavaScript as well as jQuery, Angular and other popular libraries/frameworks. With over 90 charts and 1000 maps it's a more complete solution than Google Charts or MetricsGraphics by a long shot. Check out the tech specs to see the full list of charts provided.
When considering the scalability of your app or web page, it is important to remember that picking a charting library that isn't fully complete can come back to bite you. FusionCharts is used by companies such as Microsoft, Google and IBM, so it is obviously a scalable tool, even for enterprise requirements.
Best for: Developers who need a huge range of easily customizable charts.
Epoch
Epoch is a tool built on d3.js, specifically so that developers can use real-time charts in their apps or on their web pages. Neatly documented, Epoch is 100% free and open source, so it's a good option if you don't want to financially commit to a more heavyweight solution.
With 5 chart types for both basic and real-time, Epoch doesn't stand up against fully featured products like FusionCharts or Highcharts, but it excels at representing real-time data in a simple and accessible way.
Best for: Simple and flexible real-time charting.
ECharts
Baidu's ECharts is an awesome tool for manipulating data once it's charted because it has one unique feature: Drag-Recalculate allows users to drag and drop sections of data from one chart to another and have the charts recalculate in real-time. Not to mention the fact that ECharts is made for big data and can instantly plot up to 200,000 points on a Cartesian chart and bring it to life with ZRender, a lightweight canvas library made specifically for ECharts.
Best for: Code-free, real-time data manipulation with its unique recalculate feature.
D3.js
While it's not the most user-friendly tool, there is no denying that d3.js is a force to be reckoned with in the JavaScript charting world. Plenty of other libraries expand on it because it has every feature you've come to expect, it supports HTML, SVG, and CSS and, while it doesn't come with out-of-the-box charts, it includes an overwhelming amount of user-created contributions.
Considering that D3.js is pretty hard to learn, it's worth checking out this course on data visualization and d3.js, which is as much of a solid rundown on the fundamentals as you could ask for.
Best for: Hardcore charting experts not afraid to code.
Sigma
Sigma's a bit of a niche when compared to the rest of the tools covered so far in this list because it is dedicated to graph drawing. It's built on Canvas and WebGL and has a public API, so it has a range of plugins contributed by the community on GitHub. Here's an example of what you can do with Sigma js:
Sigma is fully responsive, touch interactive, and allows developers to directly add their own functions to the scripts and render nodes and edges exactly to spec.
Best for: Developers who need a powerful, dedicated graph drawing tool.
Highcharts
The wildly popular Highcharts can create interactive charts without relying on plugins. In fact, Highcharts' flexible charting API is trusted by companies like Nokia, Twitter, Visa, and Facebook.
Highcharts is free for non-commercial use, but as soon as you want to start making money off it (and get support while you do it), it'll set you back $590 per developer licence.
Here's an example of a chart created with the tool:
If you want to learn how to start using Highcharts, check out this great quick tutorial.
Best for: Developers who want to create charts of any complexity with the tech support that comes with a premium product.
dc.js
dc.js is an open source, dimensional charting JavaScript library perfect for making interactive dashboards. The charts are relational, so when you interact with one section of the dashboard, the rest reacts to drill down to that particular data point. Here's an example:
Aside from a few online courses, the library is taught entirely through this example, so by going through their documentation you'll be able to create your own version.
While dc.js can't create charts as varied as some of the more fully featured tools in this list like ECharts or Google Charts, it focuses on its USP—exploration of large multidimensional dataset—incredibly well.
Best for: Developers who need a dashboard of relational charts for their project.
dygraphs
An absolute gem of a charting tool, dygraphs was originally developed at Google and is used to this day on Google Correlate (with a few design tweaks, of course). It can be used for intensive projects because it can plot millions of data points without slowing down, which makes its stripped-back design a forgivable flaw.
From being an internal Google tool to going out into public, dygraphs is actively supported and developed by the community, and the source is open to view on GitHub.
Best for: Developers looking for a dedicated, actively supported tool for plotting large data sets.
Vega
Vega is a d3.js based library for creating, sharing and saving visualization designs. It is made up of toolkits and systems including some that rival d3's power without the need for writing code. Vega translates JSON into SVG or HTML5 graphics which—although nothing fancy in this case—definitely gets the job done.
Since Vega doesn't require any programming (just the ability to edit values in a JSON file) it's a great alternative to the complexity of d3 while retaining the features.

NVD3
The last tool on this list is built on d3, which is the forerunner of most open source charting libraries. NVD3 is a collection of components that allow developers to create reusable charts. A variety of demos and their code can be found on the NVD3 examples page, and that's the best way to go about learning it, too.
As you can see, NVD3's style is slightly more refined than its parent's:
It supports 11 types of chart including area, line, bar, bubble, pie, and scatter and is compatible with all modern browsers and IE10 onwards.
Best for: Developers with d3 knowledge who want reusable charts.

CHENNAI: Steadfast in its opposition to the three-language formula, Tamil Nadu has shown the red flag to the Centrally-sponsored Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalalya (JNV) schools. The state government has said ‘no thanks' to the Centre's offer to set up the JNVs in the State.
Recently, Union Human Resources Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had announced 62 new JNVs across the country. But none figured in Tamil Nadu, as the State has declined to accept the proposal.
Confirming this, a senior official from the Department of School Education said this was a policy decision of the government for long. Sources said Tamil Nadu had been opposing this for long as Hindi was mandatory for children studying in these schools from Class VI to VIII.
Tamil Nadu has a two-language formula (Tamil and English) and has vigorously opposed imposition of a third language, particularly Hindi, since 1930s. Experts opined that this should not have come in the way of the State accepting the scheme.
Sources clarified that Hindi was mandatory only for middle school children and it was optional for others (Class IX-XII). They could learn their regional language along with English.
In Puducherry, almost 90 per cent JNV students learn only Tamil and English. Tamil Nadu could follow in their footsteps and open its gates to JNVs for the benefit of students from the rural areas, said C Muthiah, Principal of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Madurai.
He pointed out that NVs allow students to learn their regional language (Tamil in this case) and it could be their medium of instruction till Class VIII.Countering this, educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said JNV is against the principle of equitable access to quality education for all. Rather than spending crores on one school, the government should pump in resources for overall development in these areas, he added.
The demand for CBSE schools has shot up recently in Tamil Nadu after the Supreme Court made the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test mandatory for medical admission. The CBSE schools have increased their fees remarkably this year.
New York (CNN) President Donald Trump announced an expansion of sanctions on North Korea Thursday and praised China for taking action to limit financial transactions with the isolated communist nation.
The effort to project forward momentum in his bid to isolate Pyongyang came at the end of Trump's four-day visit to the United Nations General Assembly, where the crisis has taken prominence in rapid-pace meetings with more than a dozen world leaders.
His emphasis on economic efforts to end the standoff was a sign the President has not exhausted diplomacy in his dealings with North Korea, despite his warnings earlier in the week of dire military consequences should the nuclear provocations continue.
The new set of US sanctions on financial institutions that do business with North Korea is not targeted specifically at China, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday.
"This action is directed at everyone," Mnuchin said, adding the steps are "in no way specifically directed at China."
Mnuchin said he'd spoken with a counterpart in China earlier Thursday. But he refused to say whether they'd discussed the new measures taken by China's central bank that Trump had announced earlier.
Trump indicated ahead of talks with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts that China's leader Xi Jinping -- who was not present this week in New York -- had told financial institutions to stop dealing with North Korea. Chinese state media was not yet reporting the decision, and the White House declined to say what the source of Trump's information was.
The step would amount to major progress in US efforts to cut off support for Pyongyang as punishment for its nuclear provocations. Trump has applied pressure on Beijing, North Korea's top economic patron, to end trade and financial support.
"It is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal rogue regime," Trump said at the start of the talks, held at a hotel in New York, adding he was calling for "complete denuclearization" in North Korea.
The executive order Trump inked just ahead of the lunch enhances Treasury Department authorities to target individuals who provide goods, services or technology to North Korea, Trump said. He added the order would also allow the US to identify new industries -- including textiles, fishing and manufacturing -- as potential targets for future actions.
The order also bans ships and aircraft that have visited North Korea from entering the United States for 180 days.
"Tolerance for this disgraceful practice must end now," he said of providing resources to North Korea.
The new sanctions come two days after Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea if it continues to threaten the United States and its allies.
Trump insists that military options are on the table for dealing with North Korea, but his aides have said diplomacy is the preferred outlet for containing the nuclear crisis.
Trump himself appeared to open the door for talks with North Korea, an option he'd previously ruled out. Asked at the end of the photo-op whether dialogue was still possible with North Korea, Trump said: "Why not?"
The remark indicated fresh openness for talks with Pyongyang, despite his insistence earlier this month that "talking is not the answer."
The United Nations Security Council has approved multiple rounds of sanctions on North Korea, including on its exports. But they have yet to stop the communist nation's leader Kim Jong-un from launching ballistic missile tests, and did not prevent a massive nuclear test earlier this month.
During talks Thursday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Trump was expected to reiterate that military options are available in retaliation for North Korean threats.
That's likely to draw a rebuke from Moon, who has ruled out military action and issued warnings on the ramped-up rhetoric coming from Washington.
Still, Moon sought to appeal to Trump on Thursday, praising his bellicose remarks at the General Assembly and lambasting North Korea's "deplorable" actions.
Trump took a liking to the phrasing, saying the word "deplorable" has been "a very lucky word for me and many millions of people," a reference to Hillary Clinton's use of it to describe some of his supporters.
The lunch was meant as a display of unity, though one without the region's most important player, Xi. Trump spoke by phone with Xi on Monday and praised the leader during multiple sets of remarks here on Thursday for the banking moves, which were reported by Reuters
"That was a tremendous move, and we have great respect," Trump said. "And we also would like to thank President Xi of China. So that was a great thing he did today."
Luke Skywalker is said to have been raised on a non-arable desert planet, beneath two suns, in a landscape formed by heat, sand and dust.
On the edge of the Sahara, Star Wars director George Lucas found his dream film location and named the film planet after the Tunisian village he'd uncovered: Tatouine - or Tatooine. More than 40 years ago, the film team set up shop in Tunisia and soon started filming in a variety of locations.
Ong Jmel lies in the Southwest of Tunisia. To Star Wars fans, the location is better known as Mos Espa, the galaxy waystation where all the gloomy figures gather. It's where Luke Skywalker got to know the smuggler Han Solo, with whom he would embark on his adventures. It's also where Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker - who later became Darth Vader - was born.

Local businesses in southwestern Tunisia would benefit from an uptick in tourism
There's also the small village of Matmata, where Luke Skywalker was raised by his uncle and aunt. The house in the film is actually a hotel which was constructed in such a way as to remain cool in the desert heat - namely, underground.
In the Sidi Driss hotel, tourists can still discover film props and signs of the action, such as switchboards left in the wall. Yellowing posters and photos of the film crew are hung on the wall.
Both lications are pilgrimage destinations for Star Wars fans.
Swallowed by sand dunes
You might think that tourism here would be booming; Star Wars has millions of fans around the world, and who doesn't enjoy slipping into a Jedi knight costume and setting foot where Luke Skywalker himself once tread?
For many years, that was the case. Then terrorism came to Tunisia and the tourists stayed home. The town of Mos Espa - a collection of buildings made of wood and papier-maché - were swallowed up by the desert sand.
Save Most Espa, a 2014 initiative by fans, collected donations in excess of $75,000 for the project, a sum handed over to the Tunisian government. Mos Espa was dug out of the sand.
Attacks on tourists in Tunisia have tourists changing their vacation destinations
Nevertheless, tourists are still staying home or preferring to stay at the sandy beaches in the North of the country instead of driving the nearly 500 kilometers (over 300 miles) to the South, where George Lucas's desert planet makes its home and where there is enough sun to completely dry out the landscape.
A new tourist destination for Asians?
Loyal fans have not given up, however. Nabil Gasmi of the regional tourism organization CDTOS is continuing work to protect the film set from being forgotten. "We have to. Everyone here in the area profits from the film set and sees it as a part of their inheritance," he told German news agency dpa.
He dreams of turning the region into a tourist magnet - complete with convenience store, museum, film screenings and festivals. Residents should be brought on board, as many, especially the young people, are unemployed.
A delegation of Tunisian tourism managers presented their idea at the International Tourism Exchange (ITB) trade fair in Berlin in March 2017. They are especially interested in acquiring tourists from around Asia that are increasingly traveling around the globe to visit the hot spots. Why not add southwestern Tunisia to the list?
US-backed forces are on the verge of driving ISIS out of its stronghold and de facto capital in the northern Syria city of Raqqa, military spokesmen said Saturday.
Some ISIS fighters were going to be allowed to escape Raqqa Saturday night as part of a convoy that was to evacuate 400 civilians from the battered city in a deal brokered by local tribal chiefs and Kurdish allies of the US, officials said.
The convoy was to transport civilians held at the city's National Hospital, said Reuters.
Other civilians hoping to leave emerged from buildings after living for years under desperate conditions.
Those civilians are fleeing what looks to be the final battle over the city, which has been in ISIS possession since 2014.
The US-led coalition now surrounding Raqqa expects difficult fighting in the days ahead as it completely ousts ISIS, said Col. Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman.
The remaining militants are mostly suicide bombers who only have small arms and rifles.
The latest battle began in June, with heavy street-by-street fighting amid intense US-led coalition airstrikes and shelling.
The battle has dragged on in the face of stiff resistance, though scores of ISIS fighters have surrendered in recent days.
As Raqqa appears ready to fall, the Syrian military took control of Mayadeen, another ISIS stronghold in the country's east.
ISIS is also besieged in the city of Deir el-Zour. The group has one last major urban bastion, the town of Al Bukamal, near Syria's border with Iraq.
ISIS lost Mosul, its last major stronghold in Iraq, in July.
The deal allowing for passage for Syrian ISIS militants from Raqqa on Saturday excluded foreign fighters, which include French, Russian, Azeri, Indonesian and Turkish combatants.

The belief that foot pronation, or rolling inward of the ankles, increases the risk of injury in novice runners and requires correction with special shoes is being challenged by biomechanics experts.
Running shoe sales pitches tailor shoes to people based on providing "stability" shoes that offer support to the feet of people who "pronate," tipping the ankle toward the inside of the step.
"What you can see if you don't have the right shoe, if you will, is down the road is some injuries that can plague folks that are pronators, which is the vast majority of us," said Bryan Smith, a manager at Running Room in Toronto.
The sales strategy has been used for 30 years. An estimated 73 per cent of cross-country runners say compatibility between foot posture and shoe design is the key factor when choosing a running shoe, Danish researchers reported in a recent issue of the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
"I wear only one kind of shoe, and that's the shoe that I found works for me," said Toronto runner Ginny Wilkins, who has a bad back.
Sten Rasmussen of the Orthopedic Surgery Research Unity at Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark and his team followed 927 novice runners for a year after evaluating participants' foot posture and grouping them by degree of pronation.
"Pronators had a significantly lower [number] of injuries per 1,000/km of running than neutrals," the researchers concluded.
"The results contradict the widespread belief that foot pronation is associated with an increased risk of running-related injury."
Only comfort
Biomechanics professor Benno Nigg at the University of Calgary also studies pronation in running, which he said is a normal movement of the foot.
"The only thing that we found that had a significant and substantial effect in reducing injuries was comfort," Nigg said.
The Danish researchers also suggested comfort may be a "more relevant criterion for healthy persons on which to base their choice of a running shoe."
To judge a comfort fit, experts suggest taking new running shoes out for a road test.
Training characteristics are also considered important to prevent injuries, the Danish team said.
In the study, the researchers acknowledged that the recovery period after injury to one leg was not fully accounted for when analyzing distances for the other leg.
They said it's also possible that foot pronation may be associated with increased risk of running-related injury if other methods are used to assess pronation.
The study was funded by Aarhus University and the Danish Rheumatism Association.
RAWALPINDI: Pakistani troops serving in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were awarded UN medals in an impressive medal parade ceremony held in Bukavu on 23 March 2012.
Force Commander, MONUSCO Lieutenant General Parkash was the chief guest on the occasion. He along with other dignitaries awarded UN medals to the officers and troops of Pakistan Contingent VII.
While congratulating the Pakistani troops on the successful completion of their tenure, the chief guest lauded the efforts and sacrifices of Pakistan Army Personnel for restoration of peace and stability in the region.
He appreciated the discipline and professionalism shown by this contingent during their tenure of duty in South Kivu.
Earlier, a spectacular medal parade was witnessed by honorable guests which included Acting Governor of the South Kivu, Mr Etienne Babunga, Contingent Commanders, Senior Military Personnel of Congolese Army / Police, UN Officials and other notables of the province.
The 20-year-old produced a controlled strike to drag his side back into the game.
SNS Group
Substitute Jason Holt made his case for a starting spot in Gary Locke's Hearts team in the best way possible.
The 20-year-old replaced Callum Tapping at half-time at Tynecastle with the home side trailing 1-0 to Ross County.
Michael Ngoo and Steffen Wohlfarth traded goals after the interval before Holt stepped up to level the match.
A throw-in from the left was only partially cleared by County stopper Grant Munro.
And from just outside the area, the midfielder got his foot round the ball to volley it into the bottom corner.
It was his third goal of the season and his second at home this term.

(NaturalNews) It's become something of a catch-all diagnosis for all sorts of gut conditions of inexplicable origin. But what's commonly referred to as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is actually a variety of different gut conditions that are being inadequately or improperly diagnosed, says a leading gastroenterologist who worries that millions of people are needlessly suffering for lack of proper treatment In his new book, Professor Julian Walters from Imperial College Healthcare in London looks at a number of health conditions that are commonly misdiagnosed as IBS. These "hard to spot" gut problems afflict millions of people, but because many doctors aren't familiar with them, and the science behind them, they often go unnoticed, which means they also go untreated -- or worse, they're mistreated and consequently exacerbated.. Many people who suffer from chronic abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, as well as corresponding brain "fog," depression, and muscle and joint pain are likely intolerant to gluten. Similar to Celiac disease, gluten intolerance is a type of autoimmune condition in which gluten proteins damage the gut rather than provide nourishment to the body.Patients with gluten intolerance who are misdiagnosed with IBS and told to consume more fiber, for instance, could end up developing worse symptoms as the condition is often exacerbated by other substances besides gluten , including the fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) found in foods like onions, garlic, pears, apples, honey, wheat, and in some cases dairy.. This on-and-off constipation issue is another condition that many doctors will simply treat by telling a patient to consume more fiber or take laxatives. But like with gluten intolerance, fiber can make the problem worse, in some cases, resulting in more pain, more bloating, and more constipation.Treatments include drug regimens of 5-HT4 receptor agonists, which stimulate cells in the intestine responsible for moving food and waste more efficiently through the digestive tract. Biofeedback is another treatment option that involves a combination of diet and exercise to help better move things along.. When bacteria grow in the wrong places throughout the gut, the result can be bloating, fatigue, weight loss, and in some cases anemia--not to mention fatty stools and diarrhea. As many as 80 percent of people diagnosed with IBS suffer from SIBO, which requires careful treatment with antibiotics to help "reset the gut's microbial diversity.". IBS marked by excessive and frequent diarrhea may be a sign of bile acid malabsorption, which is when the liver produces too much bile acid in response to fat consumption. Excess bile is normally recycled by the body, but BAD sufferers experience bile being deposited into the colon, which stimulates the production of salt and water, which results in diarrhea.There are three varieties of BAD, but most people suffer from the type that's marked by a deficiency in hormone fibroblast growth factor 19, which is responsible for telling the body to stop producing bile. Again, simply advising people with BAD to consume more fiber won't get the job done, and may make the problem worse.Identifying BAD can be as simple as getting a SeHCAT test, which involves taking a drug called selenium-labeled synthetic bile salt. This salt contains a radioactive tracer substance that's retained by the body and used to track how well bile is reabsorbed by the body. Someone with normal bile function will show at least 15 percent of SeHCAT after seven days, while someone with BAD will only show about 1 to 5 percent SeHCAT.
SALEM -- Gun rights activists troubled by surging legislation meant to expand background checks for gun sales have filed recall petitions against three Oregon lawmakers. And they warn more could be on the way.
On Wednesday, a Hillsboro man submitted paperwork against Sen. Chuck Riley, D-Hillsboro, and Rep. Susan McLain, D-Forest Grove -- both of whom are in their first terms and part of an expanded Democratic majority enabled, in part, by campaign donations from gun-control advocates.
Riley, who narrowly defeated Republican incumbent Bruce Starr, was particularly helped by money from a gun-control committee led by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. His vote was key to helping Senate Bill 941 pass to the House on a 17-13 vote this week. Both McLain and Riley sponsored the bill.
On Tuesday, the day of the Senate vote, a Junction City gun shop owner submitted paperwork against House Majority Leader Val Hoyle, D-Eugene. Hoyle, who has courted gun rights advocates, had told The Oregonian/OregonLive she expected SB 941 to move quickly through her chamber. The Oregonian/OregonLive obtained all three petitions Thursday through a public records request.
The actions appear connected, at least informally, and could spread. They follow a similar effort in Colorado in 2013 that saw two lawmakers lose their posts, including the state's senate president, over support of bills far more expansive than SB 941.
"We're not interwoven I would say," said Ben Busch, the constituent who filed against McLain and Riley, also invoking their stances on education funding. "We're aware of each other's actions and support each other where we can. There's probably more on the way. It wouldn't surprise me if we have more soon."
Busch also says he expects to receive financial help -- given that he'll be running twin recall efforts -- from groups he declined to identify. He said a website could be up by the end of this week.
"We have support from other groups," Busch said.
Riley's office, when asked for comment, issued a statement from the senator that called the petitions the work of "extreme right-wing groups" who "may not like the fact that I won":
"The voters of Senate District 15 know that I have always supported common sense legislation to promote gun safety. I proudly cast a "Yes" vote on SB 941 to close the loophole that allows felons, domestic abusers, and people with severe mental illness to get access to a gun. Common sense gun safety was a key issue in my campaign and I'm delivering on my promises to the voters. Extreme right-wing groups may not like the fact that I won, but I am doing exactly what I said I would do. I respect the right of citizens to exercise their beliefs in the democratic process. I am also confident that the vast majority of people in my district support gun safety, and that my vote for SB 941 is democracy in action."
McLain's office deferred to Hoyle's office, which issued a statement from McLain:
"I ran for office to invest in our classrooms and to work on policies that protect the health and safety of our community. Since taking office in January, I've had the opportunity to work and vote on numerous bills that will improve the lives of all Oregonians. I'm proud of everything we've accomplished since the start of the session.
Unfortunately, a fringe group has started a recall effort against me over my support of a bill that will close the background checks loophole for private gun sales. I believe that this bill will save lives by ensuring that this gaping loophole isn't used to put guns into the hands of criminals, domestic abusers, and people with severe mental illness.
I fully support the 2nd Amendment, and I believe that this is a common sense policy that will make our community safer while still protecting the rights of gun owners. Our community agrees: A recent poll shows that 87 percent of Oregonians support closing this loophole, including 83 percent of gun owners.
I look forward to continuing to work with and on behalf of everyone in House District 29, and I remain focused on doing the important work of the legislature."
Hoyle also defended her support of SB 941 -- which tightens extends background checks to private gun sales -- as "common sense."
"I want to be clear that I won't be intimidated away from doing what I think is right," she said. "The recall is an important part of the democratic process and it's his constitutional right to file the petition. But it's important to note that I was reelected by a 12-point margin. I'm confident that I have the support of the majority of the people in my district."
Messages left for Kevin Starrett of the Oregon Firearms Federation also were not returned. A website run by gun advocates shows discussion over the issue, and going after Riley, was in play at least as early as March. Another discussion page on that site, Northwest Firearms, contends the activists pushing to recall Riley are "coordinating" with the firearms group.
In Oregon, it's been rare for a recall threat to actually hit the ballot. To make a likely August ballot, the recall petitioners now have 90 days to collect enough valid signatures to match 15 percent of the total votes cast for governor last year in each of the elected official's districts. That number includes write-in votes.
Officials facing recall, assuming suffiicient signatures are turned in, then have five days to resign or file a statement in their defense. The election would then be held after an additional 35 days.
Busch says Riley was chosen because of how close his victory was last fall. Riley was helped not only by the Bloomberg money but also by the presence of a libertarian candidate.
"If we went after [Sen. Floyd] Prozanski[, D-Eugene,] or [Sen. Ginny] Burdick[, D-Portland," Busch said, "it would have been a more difficult challenge."
Since taking office, Riley has supported efforts to limit how much money Washington County receives from the state's Gain Share program. Busch says that issue has sparked interest from Riley foes who aren't particularly exercised by the gun debate. Expanding their effort to wrap in outcry over other issues was among the tactical points advocates traded in March.
"It's a conversation we're following up on," Busch said.
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Bloomberg-backed committee that helped elect Riley and push hard for SB 641 this session, Everytown for Gun Safety, said the recall efforts amounted to "the dirty tricks of the gun lobby." She also pointed to what happened in Colorado after the lower-turnout 2013 elections that seemed to loom as a setback for the movement.
"We won back the seats," Erika Soto Lamb said, noting Everytown not only donated to the candidates who lost their seats but also to the candidates who reclaimed them.
One of the seats was filled by a former staffer for one of Everytown's predecessor organizations, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. And just his week, she said, efforts to repeal Colorado's background checks and ammunition limits failed.
"This is not unfamiliar for us," she said.

A hardware trader was stabbed in the abdomen when he tried to stop two snatch thieves from stealing his wife's gold necklace near a fast food restaurant in Taman Wawasan, in Parit Buntar, today.
According to a family member, Yeap Ah Kang @ Yeap Bak Seng, 73, and his wife, Teow Siew Gaik, 67, were jogging in the area before two men on a motorcycle appeared and tried to snatch Teow's necklace.
"A struggle ensued between the victim and the suspects before one of the suspects stabbed the victim with a sharp weapon, believed to be a knife. The victim died at the scene.
"The victim's wife also suffered injuries to her left arm as she was hit with the weapon used by the suspects. The two suspects managed to take the victim's necklace and fled," he told reporters at Parit Buntar Hospital.
Yeap owned a hardware shop in Simpang Tiga, Parit Buntar, and had been jogging for the past 10 days to gain some stamina before heading to China with his family on July 9, according to the family member.
Meanwhile, Kerian district police chief, Supt Omar Bakhtiar Yaacob, when contacted, confirmed the incident, saying the case was classified as murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code.
Omar Bakhtiar also urged witnesses to come forward and assist the police with the investigation.

The shiny newness of life in the workforce begins to wear off.
Jean Prince was 50 when she started working for a U.K. tech company near Cambridge as a technical author, writing software documentation. “I felt extremely lucky,” she said.
But she wasn't happy.
“The workplace has become more impersonal and tougher,” she said. “Everyone is performance-managed to death.” She felt underappreciated and unloved.
Older workers tend to be more unhappy in their jobs than their younger colleagues, according to a survey of more than 2,000 U.K. employees by human resource firm Robert Half U.K. One in six British workers over age 35 said they were unhappy—more than double the number for those under 35. Nearly a third of people over 55 said they didn't feel appreciated, while 16 percent said they didn't have friends at work.
There's the stress of being in a high-ranking position—or the disappointment of not making it far enough up the career ladder. True, salaries are higher, but life starts to get more expensive. “Work-life balance” starts to mean taking care of children, rather than just personal stress management.
“There comes a time when either you haven't achieved success, work has burned you out, or lived experience tells you family is more important,” said Cary Cooper, a workplace researcher at Manchester Business School. “You ask yourself: ‘What am I doing this for?'”
Johanna Bodnyk worked as a culture and communications coordinator at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University for six years. At a certain point, her friends were nearly all married and starting families, and she realized her current relationship wasn't going to last. That prompted her to reevaluate a lot of things in life—including her job.
Two years ago, at age 34, she switched careers and learned how to code. “Your 30s are both personally and professionally a time when people take stock and make a change,” she said.
A fifth of older British workers believe their employers don't value staff of all ages equally, according to a poll by the City & Guilds Group, a skill development organization. And a third of workers over 55 feels sidelined for younger staff, according to Capita Resourcing.
It's also possible younger people have lower expectations, higher hopes, and they're not yet burned out.
Bodnyk was thrilled just to have a job when she first started her career. “Once you get a little more stable and settled in, you then look around and ask whether you actually enjoy it,” she said.
We know older people are working. The U.S. government estimates that one in four people in the labor market in 2024 will be 55 or older.
There's a way to combat the ennui, Cooper said, but it takes effort. Making work buddies can improve the situation, even if it can be hard to find time for happy-hour drinks. Refocus on a personal project at work and make that your passion, he said.
A girl refused to marry a man for chewing gutkha (tobacco) in Murarpatti village in Uttar Pradesh's Ballia district, leaving the groom high and dry and her relatives shocked over the weekend.
According to police, the bridegroom, a resident of Dalan Chapara, had reached Lalganj village with his ‘baraat' and was given a rousing reception. But just when he was to step inside the mandap for wedding rituals, the girl spotted him chewing tobacco and refused to tie the knot with him.
Relatives of the girl,a student of Bachelor of Arts at a local college, were stunned by her decision. Friends and relatives of both the bride and groom held a protracted meeting over the night but failed to make her change her decision.
Relatives of the groom also went to the Dokati police station and complained. The girl, however, stood her ground and refused to budge.
Police station officer Vijay Singh said the girl insisted she would not marry a ‘gutkha addict.'
“Though her parents and kin of the groom made efforts to convince her for the marriage, she refused to change her decision,” village head Dhayashankar Pathak told HT.

Jon Stewart got into an epic argument with shock jock Anthony Cumia at New York's famed Comedy Cellar, with the former “Daily Show” host calling Cumia a “f - - king piece of s - - t.”
Cumia, who was fired from SiriusXM in 2014 after a racist tirade, recounted the confrontation on his Compound Media show. “We look at each other, so I put my hand out and go, ‘Hey, Jon,' and he goes, ‘I'm not shaking your hand, you f - - king piece of s - - t.' Whoa, well, my reputation precedes me.”
Cumia asked what Stewart's problem was, and the comic told him, “You talk a lot of s - - t about me.” Cumia responded that it was just comedy material, and added, “How long have you been in this business? . . . You don't know how this works?”
Cumia, meanwhile, took offense at who Stewart is happy to shake hands with. “There are plenty of pictures of him shaking hands with [alleged] pedo Anthony Weiner,” he continued, ignoring the fact that Stewart and Weiner go back a long way and were even roommates years ago.
Cumia says things got so heated, with wild expletives flying, that Noam Dworman, owner of the joint, came over to calm things down. “So there were a lot of ‘f - - k yous' and s - - t going back and forth at this point and Noam . . . is very nervous because Jon Stewart is one of the big stars who come in . . . and I'm like, ‘I'm not gonna hit him.' ” Cumia was fired by Sirius in 2014 for ‘racially charged' tweets and pleaded guilty in a domestic violence case in 2016.
Cumia claims Stewart finally reluctantly shook his hand and added, “I'm like, ‘Whatever, good night,' that's that, I go back to the bar and he goes to his table with his posse, Aziz Ansari and the little collection of beta males who are gonna discuss how they can help feminists.”
Cumia insists there were no punches thrown. “I don't fight . . . I was laughing about it, because it was so dopey. Whatever. Jon Stewart is a f - - king a - - hole.” He added, “I don't think he's ever been a good stand-up.” While Stewart didn't comment, Dworman is upset Cumia is blabbing. “He's violating the place and the terms that he's treated as a guest . . . I don't remember any comedian ever running to the papers or their comedy show to discuss what happened to them.”
German chemical plant explosion throws global car industry into turmoil
The explosion on March 31 at the Evonik chemical plant in Marl, North Rhine-Westphalia, killed two workers and also cut the world's supply of nylon-12 in half, according to the Financial Times Deutschland (FTD). Nylon-12 is a resin used in car brake and fuel lines.
The explosion at the Evonik chemical plant in Germany killed two workers and also cut the world's supply of nylon-12 in half
Nylon-12 is only made in a few places in the world, and the explosion at the Evonik plant not only stopped its own production, but also halted deliveries by one of the other main producers, French firm Arkema, which gets its raw materials from Evonik.
Evonik and Arkema together provide half of the global market for nylon-12. One of the bigger Asian suppliers, Japanese company Ube, is also suffering production setbacks following the 2011 earthquake.
In the USA, experts from eight of the country's biggest carmakers, including General Motors and Toyota, met in Detroit on April 16 to draw up a contingency plan, and US engineers are working to see if another resin can replace nylon-12. But potential new chemicals used in cars can require up to 5,000 hours of testing, which may be too long as existing stocks of nylon-12 could run out long before.
“The disruption will probably affect Europe primarily,” Rod Lache, an analyst for Deutsche Bank in New York told the FTD. He added that the US and Asia had several weeks'supplies.

Eddie Jones takes over as England Head Coach
Jones: "The future is bright for England"
England Rugby has appointed Eddie Jones as Head Coach on a four-year contract, starting in December.
Jones will take charge of England ahead of their opening RBS 6 Nations game against Scotland at Murrayfield on 6 February.
The Australian has had a long and successful coaching career, winning trophies both domestically and internationally, having also spent time coaching in England.
His first major piece of silverware came in 2001 after leading the ACT Brumbies to their first Super 12 title and in doing so becoming the first side outside New Zealand to win the tournament.
Jones took charge of the Wallabies between 2001 and 2005 and delivered both Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup success. The national side reached the 2003 Rugby World Cup final on home soil, losing narrowly to England.
After spells with the Queensland Reds and Saracens, the 55 year-old took up a technical advisor role with the Springboks in 2007, helping the South Africans win their second World Cup beating England in the final.
He later became Director of Rugby at Saracens until 2009 and then coached the Japanese club side Suntory Sungoliath.
Jones returned to the international arena in 2011 as Head Coach for Japan where his mother was born. His achievements included arguably the biggest shock in Rugby World Cup history when his side beat South Africa 34-32.
Japan went on to win three of their four pool matches and their performance saw them move into the top ten of the world rankings. Following the tournament he was appointed Head Coach of the South African Super franchise, The Stormers, before agreeing terms with the RFU.
Bright Future
“Firstly my thanks must go to Rob Wagner and everyone at Western Province Rugby for understanding my decision and allowing me to return to the international stage so quickly," said Jones.
"The opportunity to take the reins in, possibly, the world's most high profile international rugby job doesn't come along every day however, and I feel fortunate to be given the opportunity.
“I'm now looking forward to working with the RFU and the players to move beyond the disappointment England suffered at the World Cup and hope to build a new team that will reflect the level of talent that exists within the English game. I believe the future is bright for England.”
RFU Chief Executive Ian Ritchie said: “We promised to recruit a coach with proven international experience and we have done that.
"Eddie is a world-class coach, with extensive experience at the highest level with Australia, South Africa and Japan. We believe that the appointment, which was unanimously approved by the RFU Board, is the right one to bring England success in the short, medium and long term.”
Ritchie added: “We are confident Eddie can build on the strong foundations already laid, with this talented group of players largely remaining together through to the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan and beyond. We are grateful to the Stormers for their co-operation in releasing Eddie early from his contract.”
Firebase Alternative: 3 Open-Source ways to follow
Brenda Clark Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 30, 2017
Firebase Alternative: Open Source Parse
Firebase is a Google-backed, real-time backend service that empowers developers to build real-time mobile or web applications without complex protocols or rewriting the app from scratch.
It comes with many benefits such as fast and real-time updates, free tier up to 100 simultaneous connections, push-notifications support, easy setup, Robust APIs for JavaScript (including several frameworks like Angular), iOS & Android support, built-in auto-scaling, cross-platform API, and more.
Despite the fact that it's a great way to get your app up and running quickly (and easily of course), just like any other backend service, it does have some limitations which cannot be overlooked. For instance, unless your app runs on one centralized database and is updated by a vast quantity of users, it's a major overkill.
What are the downsides of Firebase?
One of its biggest and most obvious concerns is vendor lock-in, which prevents you from making your app portable. Besides that, you cannot access your data as it is hosted on the Firebase server.
Talking about vendor lock-in, it is one of the greatest obstacles to enterprise cloud adoption. To be precise, it is a situation where customers are locked-in on single cloud provider technology (i.e. vendor) for products and services and cannot switch to a different vendor without incurring substantial costs, legal constraints, or technical incompatibilities. It involves a lack of compatibility between different systems, which compels a customer to continue using products from a particular vendor. It has several disadvantages, such as:
You cannot optimize your backend according to your app's needs;
You'll lose the ability to shop around and the power to negotiate;
You'll not be aware of the new technologies that are used by other vendors;
You are always locked by Google updates, and considering the nature of these updates, it is impossible for you to customize your app on server levels;
Another downside of Firebase is its database, which can be easily disorganized, and thus, form a tree-shaped structure, which can be hard to navigate and search. Also, there's a high potential for data loss. To be exact, you may often delete your entire database accidentally when you're in the console. Remember, two or three wrong clicks and all your data is gone! Also, the data validation does not support complex objects directly, so you'd need to validate individual child nodes separately.
Additionally, neither Firebase allows easy integrations with other apps nor is it possible to install your own modules on your backend. As far as scaling is concerned, even a fully managed database provider like Firebase is not a complete solution to all your scaling related concerns, as it becomes extensive once you scale your app. That's why it's always a better idea to choose an open source framework over Firebase for scaling apps.
So, if you're looking for a more complete backend solution (open source alternative) that not only provides similar functionality like Firebase but also gives you much more control over your data, we've got you covered. In this article, we've disclosed three of the best alternatives to Firebase.
So, without wasting no time, let's dive in!
1-Parse Server
Overview: It's no secret that Parse.com it was the best Backend as a Service in 2016 when facebook decided to turn it off. Parse Server (the open source version of Parse) was created by facebook (and the open source community) with the same power and a huge and important differential: to be Open Source.
Parse Server comes with a gazillion out-of-the-box features that allows you to get your MVP out quick and effortlessly. Currently, Parse server is the most popular and robust BaaS framework available that helps developers build mobile apps faster without any technical locks. It is an open source version of the Parse backend that can be easily downloaded for free on GitHub. Many developers have successfully migrated their apps from other platforms to Parse Server.
Presently, the Parse Server is quite active, with 143 contributors and more than 14k stars on GitHub. The key attribute that sets Parse Server apart from Firebase and other fellow app development counterparts is that it can work with the Express Web Application framework, can be easily added to existing web applications, and can even run by itself, if required. Furthermore, it can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.
Pros:
Allows you to easily customize the foundation of your app, to make it suitable for other OSs;
Complete Dashboard to accelerate your backend development and manage your App easily;
Provides you a very complete range of prebuilt SDKs to plug into your app project;
Empowers you to make modifications to the API without having to write the code, and you can easily view analytics or push notifications as well;
Parse Server is open source, which means you can have access to it anytime;
Comes with a plethora of features that offer a better user experience;
Can be hosted in almost any environment.
Cons:
Missing a stable command line interface to automate your custom code development;
It's not multi-tenancy App compliant;
No custom atomic operations.
Parse Server Made Simple
Back4App.com is the best implementation of Parse Server and solved these downsides. They have a very user-friendly CLI, it is possible to create as many Apps as you want and you can custom your Backend in many ways.
2-Hoodie
Overview: Hoodie is the First Offline JavaScript Backend that makes web application development very fast, easy, and accessible. It is a simple, self-hosted, and open source platform that allows developers to build robust and intuitive applications for both web and iOS. It utilizes a noBackend technology that makes the lives of developers unbelievably easy. Being a developer, all you need to do is deploy the Hoodie's backend to your server, and forget about it.
The key trait that gives Hoodie a competitive edge over Firebase and other app development platforms is the fact that it gives the control back in the hands of the frontend developer by abstracting away the backend completely. Yes, you heard it right! With Hoodie frontend development, without worrying about your server side, you just need to focus on its simple, easy-to-learn-and-implement frontend API. Unlike other backend platforms, Hoodie uses a community-driven approach to API designing, known as Dreamcode.
One of Hoodie's primary goals is to help users overcome their crippling dependence on the internet. With Hoodie, you can do it all — post comments, synchronize data, handle payments, edit accounts, send emails, and more without worrying about having a connection.
Pros:
It has a noBackend, Dreamcode-driven API, which makes Hoodie code a breeze to write and read;
NoBackend means you don't need a back-end developer;
It's the biggest advantage is its offline support, which solves the major problem of connectivity dependence;
Cons:
Going offline can be quite frustrating sometimes, as you can't have access to your Google Docs.
It has a very small developer community and a very few of Firebase's trademark features.
3-Horizon
Overview: Horizon is a real-time, open-source backend platform that allows you to rapidly build and deploy web and mobile apps using a simple JavaScript API. Built by the RethinkDB team and an open-source community, Horizon lets you scale your app to millions of users without any backend code. It is a standalone server for browser-based JavaScript apps. Here's the best part: whenever you feel like you're ready to write custom backend code, you can easily load the Horizon modules directly in Node.js.
Horizon is made up of three key components:
A middleware backend server built with Node.js and RethinkDB that supports data persistence, user authentication, input validation, real-time streams, and permissions; A JavaScript client library that frontend developers can use for storing JSON documents in the database, performing queries, and subscribing to live updates;
A command-line (CLI) tool that can help you start up a local Horizon development server, generate project templates, and deploy your Horizon app to the cloud.
Pros:
Built on RethinkDB, Horizon not only allows you to host your data but also do complex queries;
You can build and deploy cross-platform, real-time web and mobile apps at lightning speed;
Horizon is open source, which means you can run it on your laptop, deploy it to the cloud, or deploy it to any other infrastructure if required;
Unlike Firebase, you can build complex enterprise apps with Horizon, not just basic ones with limited functionality;
It reduces the amount of friction that developers face while building and scaling Web applications;
It eliminates repetitive boilerplate and tedious steps such as hand-writing CRUD endpoints, authentication, and session management, and this is what makes it different from Firebase and other app development platforms.
Cons:
It lacks numerous useful features that Firebase provides;
Some of Horizon's flagship features are less mature than other platforms;
Unlike Firebase, it has a small developer community;
The Horizon team are refining some features and incorporating further improvements, because of which developers might encounter some rough edges while writing code;
The long-term roadmap is still evolving;
The Horizon code base is not as stable as Firebase or Hoodie.
Firebase Alternatives
Final Thoughts
These are just three of the many open-source alternatives to Firebase. Being a developer, you don't want your backend to be a deadlock for your app, which is why it is always advisable to decide wisely. One additional risk to consider while choosing an app development platform is longevity. Remember, if the service you're about to choose is not around for long, possibilities are that you'll have to find another alternative and migrate again. Also, bear in mind how easy it is to migrate data from that specific platform or stack. While considering the costs upfront is important, take a look at how those costs will ascend as your app scales.
Here's the most important thing to consider — always choose a technology that you're already comfortable with or looking forward to learning, forget the rest. After pondering all these options I decided to go with Back4App.
Emmanuel Adebayor has issued a withering condemnation of Tottenham Hotspur's fans over their attitude to him, describing them as a “joke”.
Emmanuel Adebayor has issued a withering condemnation of Tottenham Hotspur's fans over their attitude to him, describing them as a “joke”.
Adebayor was heavily criticised by Tottenham fans for taking five days to return to London following Togo's elimination from the Africa Cup of Nations this month, but the striker said the supporters' behaviour was laughable.
Referring to the armed attack on Togo's team bus in Angola three years ago, Adebayor implied Tottenham's followers should develop a sense of what is important in life.
He said: “I've seen people dying in front of me. I've seen people with guns so I take 30,000 people abusing me as a joke. It's a part of life. I'm used to it already. I get a tough time but I have to keep going because I could have been worse.”
Togo went out of the Africa Cup of Nations on Feb 3 but Adebayor did not return to England until five days later, less than 24 hours before Tottenham's game against Newcastle.
Adebayor said the delay was the result of a request that he and the rest of the Togo team visit their president, who wanted to acknowledge their achievement in reaching the quarter-finals. “I was just trying to help my team-mates in the national team,” the striker said.
“We went out on the Sunday, then we tried to find a plane to go to Togo to see the family and the president. It took us four days to get a plane. On Thursday I had to call the president [Faure Gnassingbe] to tell him we had to leave South Africa. He told us to get to the airport at 4pm. We did, and we ended up staying at the airport for more than 10, 12 hours.
“That's not my fault, I couldn't do anything. I can't just put something on my body and fly from South Africa to London. I couldn't just abandon my team. We went to the quarter-finals of African Nations Cup, which was historical for my country.
“I could not just jump on a plane and come back to Tottenham, because the president of the country wanted to see us and congratulate us. I am the captain so I have to be there. So that's what I did. Then I got the flight the club sent to me.”
He said Togo's lack of financial power made it harder for the country's returning players. “When Ivory Coast went out of the tournament, the president of the federation sent them a plane to get back. With Togo, it's not the same. You want to think about football but that's not the case with Togo. You have to concentrate on what you are going to eat, where you are going to sleep. That's what I have been doing for the last 10 years.”
Tottenham supporters have become increasingly exasperated this season with Adebayor, who has scored just three times for the club after managing 18 goals in 37 games last season. But he said he was determined to help the club finish above rivals their north London Arsenal, for whom he used to play.
“For me it's a big opportunity to show people I was right to leave Arsenal, which means finishing on top of them. If that's with Tottenham it's even better.”
West Ham co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan have urged the club's fans to avoid using any discriminatory chants when they host Tottenham to Upton Park on Monday night.
A small minority of West Ham's travelling support were criticised in the aftermath of the Hammers' 3-1 defeat at Spurs in November for anti-Semitic chanting. Co-owner Gold is of Jewish heritage and his joint statement with Sullivan stressed that any fans found guilty of partaking in such chanting would face strict punishments.
“We have made it very clear that we will not tolerate any form of discriminatory behaviour and one by one we will root out those fans that do not deserve to represent this great club of ours,” the statement said. “We must be clear that we will pursue the harshest sanctions against any individual who goes against what we stand for as a club.”

A rainy Sunday afternoon didn't stop host Thailand from proceeding according to plan with the kickoff of International Fleet Review 2017. Unfortunately, that meant navy officers from 19 countries were invited to march through Pattaya's dirty, flooded streets.
These guys deserve a medal for bravery for their willingness to come in contact with the wastewater of Thailand's own sin city.
Headed by the Royal Thai Navy, the parade featured crew members of each of the participating countries, including navy units from the United States, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Russia, China and some fellow ASEAN countries.
They walked about two kilometers on the beach road from Tawanna Night Bazaar to Pattaya 8 school in Central Pattaya.
The fleet review, held to mark ASEAN's 50th anniversary, is taking place today at the upper Gulf of Thailand.
Meanwhile on social media, Thais showed that while they may not be well-versed on the country's military ties and naval capabilities, they can still appreciate a man in uniform, with a post celebrating their arrival having received nearly 25,000 shares on Facebook.

Hello 🙂
Saturday I had a fantastic day! I went to LUSH Gent, with 2 sisters Lushies because some of the new products from LUSH Oxfordstreet finally came to Belgium and it was the stores 3rd birthday 😀 So we HAD to go and indulge ^^
Because a birthday is always a happy occasion, we dressed up for it 😉 The dress code was pink. Beside from old pink pyjamas I didn't have anything else pink in my wardrobe. That didn't stop me though 😉 When you came in pink, you would get a pink surprise 😀 ^^
An old white t-shirt made the perfect canvas for a birthday celebration shirt 😀 I took as much pink LUSH products and put them on the shirt. I didn't take a picture of the front, but it also was decorated. The girls in the store were super excited about the shirt. I ended up leaving it there 😀
I'll show you my purchases first and then give you an overload of pictures I took in the store 😉 I saved up some money to do a nice haul and I'm very happy with what I got ^^
New Charity Pot Handcream(mini) €2.95
Grease Lightning Spot Treatement €9.95
Refresher Shower Jelly (100g) €6.50
Woosh Shower Jelly (100g) €5.95
American Cream Hair Conditioner (100g) (little gift because I left my t-shirt)
Beautiful Shower Gel (100g) €8.50
The Comforter Shower Cream (250g) €16.95
Granny Takes A Dip Bubble Bar €5.95
The Comforter Bubble Bar €6.95
Yuzu & Cocoa Bubbleroon €6.25
Sunnyside Bubble Bar €6.95
Yoga Bomb Bath Bomb €5.95
Twilight Bath Bomb €4.95
There was a workshop ‘Make your own Comforter Bubble Bar' at the store, but by the time we got there (2 pm) they had already run out of materials to make them, so I resorted to buying one. How else would I enjoy berry bubbles in my foot bath? I admit, I was bummed that we could not do the workshop. It would have been a great experience, I'm sure 😉
Rockstar Soap (the pink surprise)
Serenditity Soap (100g) €4.95
Respect Your Elders Soap (105g) €5.20
Coalface Soap (105g) €9.40
Miranda Soap (115g) €6.04
I had silently hoped that the pink surprise would be a Comforter mini shower gel, but it was one of my other favotires 🙂 I'm happy to have another piece of Rockstar Soap 😀
Following now are some picture that I took in the store.
Look at those colours !!! God, I wish I could post a scented picture … these all smell so good 🙂
They dropped an Intergalactic Bath Bomb in a bowl of water. I love the blue water, the scent was not for me, but look at it !!!
It's not in every store that you can try (and retry) all the products. At LUSH you can royally treat yourself. It's like going to the spa 😉
There was a steady stream of people coming and going. There was still a nice buzz going on when we left.
Thanks to the lovely and bubbly staff for making our visit memorable and fun 😀 I didn't get pictures of all the staff members, but they were all dressed in pink ^^
Also thanks to my 2 sister Lushies, it was very nice to get to know you in person. I had a blast 😀 I can't wait to do this again !!!
Have you tried / smelled / seen the new LUSH products yet ? What is your favourite ?
Be Happy !!!

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - MAY 29: Marcus Adams of the Bulldogs in action during the 2016 AFL Round 10 match between the Collingwood Magpies and the Western Bulldogs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on May 29, 2016 in Melbourne, Australia. (Photo by Adam Trafford/AFL Media)
Luke Beveridge has made two changes to the side that defeated Port Adelaide last weekend, bringing in Lin Jong and defender Marcus Adams.
The Bulldogs return to Etihad Stadium on Saturday night to face the second-placed Cats, just eleven percentage points separating the two sides going into round thirteen.
Adams comes straight back into the Bulldogs line-up after recovering from a minor ankle injury that saw him a late withdrawal last weekend.
In nine career games to date the 23-year old Adams has consistently taken on the AFL's best, tall or small, covering everyone from Matthew Pavlich and Nat Fyfe in round one to Josh Kennedy and Eillot Yeo in Round 11.
Speaking to westernbulldogs.com.au, assistant coach Daniel Giansircusa said he expects Adams to add to his resume' on Saturday night with a likely match-up on hulking Geelong forward Tom Hawkins.
“He's been an important player for us this year, [and] for a first year player, [it] says something about the way he's gone about it," Giansiracusa said.
“It'll be good to get him back in, obviously with Hawkins back in the side for Geelong.
“Because he's that mature age player we've got no qualms with him playing on the best.
“He's done that this year, done it pretty well, so we're looking forward to that again on Saturday night.”
Joel Hamling comes out for Adams, while Lin Jong returns to the senior side in place of the injured Luke Dahlhaus,.
Jong's 32 possession, five tackle, two goal outing for Footscray last weekend was the latest in a run of strong performances at VFL level.
“Jongy was fantastic last week and we look forward to him putting his best foot forward and probably bringing that energy that Luke brings," he said.
“He's hard around the contest, Jongy, and hopefully he can get on his bike and spread and put the Geelong mids under some pressure.
“He'll play a few different roles, but that midfield/forward role he'll play.”
The match will also be young star Marcus Bontempelli's 50th game.

(Reuters) - A group representing major technology companies has aligned itself against Qualcomm Inc in its legal dispute with Apple Inc by calling on regulators to reject Qualcomm's bid to ban the import of iPhones.
The Apple logo is pictured on an iPhone in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau
A lobbying group that represents Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc filed comments with the U.S. International Trade Commission.
They argued that barring Apple from importing foreign-assembled iPhones that use Intel Corp chips - as Qualcomm has requested - would cause “significant shocks to supply” for phones and would hurt consumers.
Qualcomm declined to comment.
Intel and Apple rival Samsung are members of the group, called the Computer & Communications Industry Association. Apple is not a member of the group.
“If the ITC were to grant this exclusion order, it would help Qualcomm use its monopoly power for further leverage against Apple and allow them to drive up prices on consumer devices,” Ed Black, the CEO of the group, said in a statement. “What's at stake here is certainly the availability of iPhones and other smartphones at better prices.”
Qualcomm supplies so-called modem chips to Apple, which help iPhones and iPads connect to cellular data networks. The two have been locked in a sprawling legal battle in which Apple has objected to Qualcomm's business model of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before buying chips.
In turn, Qualcomm has accused Apple of directing its contract manufacturers like Foxconn to withhold license payments in a bid to hurt Qualcomm. The conflict has taken a toll on Qualcomm's profit outlook.
Earlier this month, Qualcomm sued Apple on separate allegations that Apple infringed six patents around making iPhones work better without draining the battery.
Simultaneously, Qualcomm filed a complaint with the U.S. ITC seeking to ban iPhones that use chips “other than those supplied by Qualcomm affiliates.” Apple began using Intel chips in the iPhone 7.
Most of the time, International Women's Day is a holiday little-recognized and rarely-celebrated in the United States. This year, however, it has suddenly acquired the sort of attention it hasn't had in decades. Opponents of President Donald Trump are turning International Women's Day into a second women's march, like the one that occurred the day after the inauguration. The event, dubbed “A Day Without a Woman,” is telling women to stay home and avoid both paid and unpaid labor to demonstrate the role they play in everyday American life. In 2017, “A Day Without a Woman” is a day without female workers or shoppers, a strange end for a holiday founded by socialists to commemorate a garment worker's strike.
The first Women's Day was not international. In 1909, the Socialist Party of America designated February 28 “National Women's Day,” selecting the date to honor a garment worker's strike in New York City the year before. At a meeting of the Socialist International in 1910, socialist groups in both Europe and America supported the idea of a day to honor the movement for women's rights and to gather support for women's suffrage.
Beginning in 1911, more than a million people attended Women's Day rallies in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The female marchers demanded not only the right to vote and hold office, but the right to vocational training and work.
During 1913 and 1914, International Women's Day marches doubled as protests against World War One. In Russia, where casualties on the eastern front were shockingly high, women marched on the last Sunday in February to protest the war. Although demonstrations continued for several years on or around March 8, none of them are remembered as well as the march in 1917.
After years of wartime suffering, women in Russia struck for “Bread and Peace” in 1917. According to the Julian calendar used in czarist Russia, the march fell on the last Sunday of February. In the Gregorian calendar, this date was March 8. Four days after the march, the Czar abdicated. Within days, a new socialist Russia was taking shape.
In memory of the march that sparked the czar's abdication, in the Soviet Union International Women's Day was one of eight major public holidays. The connection between radical political groups and International Women's Day did not end with Soviet Russia. Since the early 20th century, International Women's Day has continued to be associated with socialist movements.
In the United States, the holiday shifted from being associated with women's suffrage to a connection with Communism. Despite the protesters' ire towards Trump, the protests are not primarily a push for women's rights.
Marches are organized around the world by various organizations each supporting their own list of the rights women ought to have. One of the largest is the International Women's Strike, which was organized in 2016 by Polish women protesting a law that would have banned abortion. The group adopted tactics used by feminists in Iceland in 1975 and sparked grassroots protests around the world.
According to the official International Women's Strike group, the protests this year signal their disapproval not only of Trump, but also a broad range of social and economic issues.
“March 8th will be the beginning of a new international feminist movement that organizes resistance not just against Trump and his misogynist policies,” the IWS wrote, “but also against the conditions that produced Trump, namely the decades long economic inequality, racial and sexual violence, and imperial wars abroad.”
The IWS group did not organize the “A Day Without a Woman” march, but the event's website shows that American feminists agree with many of the same principles as their socialist sisters.
In Washington, D.C., the organizers of the city's “A Day Without a Woman” event stand “in solidarity with the International Women's Strike organizers.” Their list of goals is long, covering a laundry list of desires from freedom from gender norms to an end to hiring discrimination and “Gender Justice.” Notably, it includes language stressing the importance of unions.
“Unions and other labor associations are critical to a healthy and thriving economy for all,” the organizers write, while encouraging supporters to attend International Women's Day marches if they desire. Women are encouraged to wear red as they spend the day neither working, nor shopping.
Despite the obvious association of red with socialist and communist causes, in Washington, the organizers of “A Day Without a Woman,” skirt the issue. They instead advocate wearing red as “a color signifying revolutionary love and sacrifice.”
The strike has attracted attention even before it began. By Tuesday afternoon, school in Alexandria, Va. was cancelled for Wednesday since too many teachers had requested the day off. Some restaurants with female owners were also planning to close or offer limited hours so that their employees could observe the strike.
Ironically, the angry tone of the forthcoming march is more radical than celebrations in Russia, where the day is generally commemorated by giving gifts to mothers, wives, and girlfriends.

Way back in the late '90s and early 2000s, many Perl fans could rattle off a list of big projects using Perl: Slashdot, Amazon.com, IMDB. Eyebrows popped up (maybe at one point), as if the fact that billions of dollars of online sales went through Perl were validation of a language.
Perhaps it is.
Today much of the online Perl community discussion reads as reactionary, at least to me. Some random Internet argument will degrade into "Perl? Isn't that insert negative description here?" versus "Nuh uh, Perl isn't insert negative description here!"
Me, I'd rather hear about interesting new projects written in Perl. Take the recent Duck Duck Go written in Perl story. Repeat this a few dozen times (especially with new projects created in the past year or two) and responses will move from "Perl? People still use that?" to "Wow, people who know Perl can certainly do a lot of interesting things!"
I'd rather see the latter message spread than almost any other marketing message—so tell the world, what are you working on with Perl?

Silicon Valley, much like baseball, has its share of phenoms, those up-and-comers who demonstrate extraordinary promise.
Meet the latest: Elizabeth Holmes.
The 30-year-old Stanford dropout turned paper multibillionaire has quietly worked for 11 years on her startup, which aims to give all of us better information about our bodies in a quest to revolutionize how we manage our health.
“If people can really begin to understand their bodies, that can help them change their lives,” she said during a recent interview at the Palo Alto headquarters of Theranos, a mix of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”
Over the past year, Holmes has embraced a more public profile, recently snagging the cover of Fortune magazine in what bore all the hallmarks of a carefully orchestrated media push. Her board includes a Who's Who of American political influence — former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, former Defense Secretary Bill Perry, a couple of former U.S. senators, a Marine general. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is one of her investors.
Familiar qualities
Holmes' drive to change the world has a familiar ring here. She may actually do it — or not. It's always hard to know in Silicon Valley whether the hype matches the reality.
The tech industry has seen phenoms before. They are typically young, bold and single-minded with boundless ambition. Think Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg.
What often distinguishes great leaders are qualities like determination and persistence, but something else too, said Bob Sutton, a Stanford engineering school professor and co-author of “Scaling Up Excellence.”
“They believe they are destined to do something special,” he said.
In that respect, Holmes is cast from the same mold as Jobs et al. She launched the company, she told me, after “thinking about what is the greatest change I could make in the world.”
Holmes, who hates needles, zeroed in on blood tests as a starting point. If blood tests were easier, cheaper and more convenient — Theranos aims to put a lab within a mile of any city dweller — people could take multiple tests over time and see signs of a disease or condition before it's too late, Holmes argues.
She recalled the death of her uncle, whose skin cancer progressed rapidly to brain cancer.
“You look at something like that and it doesn't make sense,” she said softly. “If it was caught in time, it's a completely manageable condition.”
To that end, Theranos has devised software and hardware so that with just one pinprick of blood, critical medical tests can be run more cheaply and more conveniently.
In September, Theranos and Walgreens announced a deal to open Theranos “wellness centers” at one Walgreens in Palo Alto as well as 20 stores in Phoenix. The goal is to expand to all 8,200 Walgreens stores nationwide. Theranos' main revenue stream is payment from customers or their insurance providers for lab tests. The company has other revenue streams through its long-term strategic partners, which it declined to discuss.
With Theranos, Holmes is taking on the $70 billion U.S. blood-testing industry dominated by companies such as Quest and LabCorp. But she says her aim is something bigger, creating a new market called “consumer health technology,” which Holmes describes as engaging and empowering people about their health.
“Here in California, I can go and buy a gun and shoot myself but I can't order a vitamin D test because I might do something quote ‘clinically dangerous,' ” she said. “We feel strongly over time that this has to change.”
Shultz, who meets weekly with Holmes to discuss the business, described Theranos as “on the cusp of a real movement in preventive medicine.”
“What Elizabeth is doing is important in diagnostics, that the more you are able to spot something before it occurs, the more you can do something about it,” he said.
‘Critical piece'
Theranos faces numerous regulatory, logistical and market challenges, said Eric Lakin, an analyst with DeciBio Consulting, a market research firm. Still, the potential is great.
“With current efforts to realize the dream of personalized medicine, Theranos may play a critical piece in this puzzle,” he said. “But as with all puzzles, it often takes time to collect these pieces and put them together in a meaningful way.”
Holmes' background is right out of the phenom playbook. Growing up in Texas, Holmes taught herself Mandarin and launched a business in high school selling C++ compilers to Chinese universities. She applied for her first patent while at Stanford, where she majored in chemical engineering. In the summer before her sophomore year, she went to Singapore to work at the Genome Institute on the SARS virus.
Then she dropped out of Stanford to begin working on Theranos, using the money her parents had saved for college for the business.
“She may be the female Mark Zuckerberg that Silicon Valley has been waiting for,” said Vivek Wadhwa, a professor and researcher at Stanford and Duke and a lecturer on entrepreneurship. “She started when she was young, defied the odds and built a great technology, and is doing good for the world.”
Tim Draper, the venture capitalist, said Holmes, who was friends with his daughter growing up, is the first entrepreneur he knows who kept quiet about her business for so long “so that the competition wouldn't get a chance to start.”
“She had a winner and knew it,” he said. His firm DFJ Venture was the first to invest.
In recent years, Theranos' head count has mushroomed to about 500 employees, up from 100 in 2010. It took over the former offices of Facebook at the Stanford Research Park.
Holmes has raised $400 million, valuing the entire company at $9 billion. She has a 50 percent stake, leading Forbes to call her “the youngest woman to become a self-made billionaire.”
As for her gender, Holmes, who wears all black suits and heels and speaks in a deep, soft voice, has never allowed herself to think of it as an issue, she says.
But she knows people are paying attention.
“If I can show that in this country, a 19-year-old girl can drop out of school and build something like this,” she said, “then other women should be doing it.”

A Scottish beach was handed a strange Christmas present last month, when 250 used car tyres washed up on the shore.
Many worn tyres were discovered in Granton several days before Christmas, with no official explanation as to how they got there.
Flytipping is currently the most likely reason behind the strange arrival, reports The Scotsman.
Several tyres were covered in barnacles, indicating that they had been in the sea for a while. The tyres were soon cleared up by local residents, who placed them together at the top of the beach.
Jan Baker - who helped arrange the clearance - described the situation as "bizarre". She said: "Where did they come from? And why do they have to end up on our beach?"
The council's North Team had been contacted to inspect the tyres, and have since claimed that the beach by Granton Harbour belongs to the Crown Estate, which needs to arrange for the tyres to be collected.
However, due to the busy holiday period, the Crown Estate is still looking into whether it actually owns the land in which the tyres were found.
City deputy leader Steve Cardownie said that he hoped the tyres would be removed as soon as possible.
He said: "Someone will have to get this sorted out as soon as possible because Wardie Bay is a site of special scientific interest which prevented it from being developed many years ago.
"As a key part of the city it's imperative that these tyres should be removed as soon as possible. Now it's been brought to my attention I will raise it first thing in the morning and I don't care which agency does it."
He added that it was "strange" for so many tyres to wash up in one go, and said that a ship may have lost some of its load.
"It seems as though the tyres have been collected for a purpose," he explained.
"It's maybe an accident that a load has come loose on a vessel and that's why they have washed up in one current. If they have been lost from a ship it might be possible to trace which vessel it was and see if they can be punished.
"But it may be that they have been dumped in Forth and the current has washed them in. There's no doubt that 250 tyres is a significant amount and mystery surrounds how they came to be here. But it's a mystery we will no doubt solve in the following days."
Tyres are not allowed to be used as a landfill, and are required by law to be recycled or reused.
Story highlights Coach says young pilot was a soccer player who had a knack for when to tell joke
Haris Suleman, 17, was at the controls during his trip around the world
His father, Babar Suleman, was traveling with him and is missing
Haris' sister says her brother and dad had trained for a water landing
It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. An aerial endeavor that would take 17-year-old pilot Haris Suleman and his father, Babar, around the world in just 30 days and into the record books.
The journey, months in the planning, would take the pair on a 26,500-mile odyssey, with 25 stops planned in 15 countries. The aim was to raise funds for a charity in Pakistan that helps poverty-stricken children go to school.
Instead, the American teenager is now confirmed dead and his father is missing after their plane crashed into the ocean off American Samoa on Tuesday night.
Haris had been due home in Indiana on Saturday, his sister Hiba Suleman told reporters Wednesday.
His body has been recovered, she said. But their father, also a pilot, has not been found.
"We're hoping my dad is alive and well, and we're going to keep praying until we have a definitive answer," Hiba Suleman said.
She told reporters the plane was about 23 miles from the island when it crashed. Her father wouldn't have let Haris take off if the weather was bad, she said.
It is unclear why the plane crashed or why the duo took off at night.
"He was doing something that he loved. He was doing something adventurous," she said of her brother, who received his pilot's license in June. And he was doing it for a good cause, she added.
'On my bucket list forever'
In an interview with CNN affiliate WISH TV last month, only days before the pair set off, Haris appeared excited as he outlined their itinerary -- which if completed in 30 days in their single-engine plane would have made him the youngest pilot to achieve the feat.
He also told how he and his father had received survival training in case of having to ditch their plane in the water.
Babar Suleman, asked about the inherent risk involved in such a venture, said he put his faith in sound preparations.
"In all these endeavors, the biggest part of the whole thing is the planning," he said. "While he was training and getting his license, I was busy planning all the different segments, all the different fuel stops, different cruise profiles. I set up all of the plans and he will do all the execution."
The record-breaking attempt, he said, "has been on my bucket list forever."
Babar Suleman also spoke of the importance of the work done by the Seeds of Learning charity , an Indiana group which supports the work of the Citizens Foundation in Pakistan.
The money raised, he said, would help open schools "for underprivileged children who otherwise would not have a hope of getting an education and may even end up in the wrong hands."
He expanded on his charitable motivation for the trip in his blog, Around the World in 30 Days , explaining how in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States he had come to the conclusion "that lack of proper education contributed to the events of that day."
The work of the Citizens Foundation to provide education to thousands of impoverished Pakistani children is, he said, "the noblest of all causes."
The last entry on the blog is posted from Bali, Indonesia.
'Huge heart'
The principal of the high school where Haris was a rising senior said the school was deeply saddened by his death.
"Haris' adventurous spirit and huge heart led him to reaching for this personal goal while also seeking to raise funds and awareness for schools supported by The Citizens Foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Karachi, Pakistan," said Melvin Siefert, principal of Plainfield High School.
A soccer coach at the school told the Indianapolis Star that Haris was a great student and a talented player.
"Haris loved to joke a lot," David Knueve told the newspaper. "He just got the team sort of laughing at the right moments."
His sister said Haris planned to be an engineer like his father.
The oldest sibling, a brother, was trying to get from London to American Samoa to pick up Haris' body but there were only a few flights, Hiba Suleman said.
Emergency beacons
A Coast Guard spokeswoman, Petty Officer Melissa McKenzie, said a plane would aid in the search for Babar Suleman.
He and Haris were wearing "gumby" suits that could help them survive a water landing, Hiba Suleman said. She said they had taken a course in how to survive a crash in the ocean.
They also had life rafts aboard.
The next legs of the trip were supposed to cross the Pacific Ocean, with stops in Kiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) and Hawaii.
The plane has yet to be recovered, but emergency beacons were sending out signals.
The National Transportation Safety Board said the plane was a Beechcraft Bonanza A36.
Diego Sanchez Expected to Face Matt Hughes at UFC 135 on Sept. 24 in Denver
Diego Sanchez has confirmed his appearance on the upcoming UFC 135 card set for Denver on Sept. 24. He will face UFC legend Matt Hughes.
While the UFC has yet to officially announce UFC 135, the fight card now apparently has it's first fight confirmed.
Diego Sanchez took to Twitter on Wednesday and announced that he would be fighting on the card.
“Fighting in Denver Sept 24,” Sanchez wrote. “Mark your calendars.”
Sanchez will face former UFC welterweight champion Matt Hughes in a bout expected for the main card on the September show.
The card is currently rumored to take place at the Pepsi Center. This will be the first visit for the UFC to Colorado since UFC on Versus 1 took place in Broomfield in March 2010
Sanchez will return to action after a close decision win over Martin Kampmann at UFC on Versus 3 in Louisville, Ky., in March. It was the former “Ultimate Fighter” winner's third fight back at welterweight after making a run for the lightweight title in 2009.
Hughes will try to bounce back from a first-round loss to B.J. Penn in a fight they had at UFC 123 in Detroit in November 2010. Prior to that loss, Hughes had won three fights in a row including victories over Renzo Gracie and Ricardo Almeida.
More fights are expected to be confirmed for the UFC 135 card in the coming weeks.
The University of New Mexico is under fire to change its seal. The current seal depicts two Spanish conquistadors. This is part of a wider movement asking for universities to remove controversial symbols. This includes calls to rename Calhoun College at Yale, remove Wilson imagery at Princeton, or change the Harvard Law School Crest. This movement is not exclusive to the US. Similar calls are being made to remove perceived symbols of colonialism in South Africa and elsewhere. Nor are these calls exclusive to the political left. Conservatives at my alma mater want to get rid of a Che Guevara mural.
I for one am against these calls.
I am against these calls on the basis that I do not feel college campuses should be safe spaces. Students should be exposed to ideas they may found troubling in college. Students need not embrace these ideas. I am not making the case that we should re-institute slavery or attack the nearest Indian reservation. Students are free to, and I hope, reject these ideas but they should be exposed to them if only so they know their weaknesses.
More importantly though I feel that it whitewashes history. I am against these calls for the same reason I dislike seeing whites celebrate Native American Day. Removing symbols of colonialism or observing an indigenous people's day are good symbols that efforts are underway to correct historical injustices. However in practice they are a way for people to pat themselves on the back for being socially progressive and little else.
There are many things that could be done to improve the welfare of Indians, but few have the drive to carry them out. Why should they? Instead of changing bad public policy they can get rid of a seal or statue and think they've done their part. If they're particularly lazy they can change their facebook display image to include a rainbow or French flag. Symbols of colonialism should be kept and used to remind people that historical injustices continue to be propagated.
In the specific case of the UNM seal I am concerned that it is too easy for attacks against Spanish conquistadors to be turned into general attacks against the Columbian exchange. The enslavement and massacre of Indians was awful. However it is difficult, especially since I am a mestizo, to believe that the interaction between the two worlds was ultimately for the worse. To the contrary the exchange made the world richer.
Pizza is a prime example of this. Pizza could not exist prior to the Columbian exchange. Europeans lacked tomatoes and native Americans lacked wheat. The first pizza was made in Italy, but even then what most of us think of pizza has its roots in New York City. Pizza is a mestizo, half European half American. If UNM does change its seal it should consider having a native and conquistador sharing a slice.

Beekeepers are buzzing over a victory at city hall.
The city's property and development committee not only voted on Tuesday to allow bee hives in the downtown, but made it a permitted use and not conditional.
The difference means lower fees for beekeepers to start hives. A conditional use permit would have cost beekeepers upwards of $1,200 plus taxes.
A permitted use for bees would be approximately $200.
The new city bylaw will allow beekeepers to start hives on rooftops of downtown buildings.
Beekeeper Chris Kirouac was at the meeting at city hall on Tuesday and said this is a great first step. He hopes that hives will eventually be allowed across the whole city.
"So I'm hoping that within a year or two we can see it open a lot wider, for myself I think that we have enough really solid examples from cities across Canada that have it wide open, that have had positive experiences that we don't need to drag our feet on this." Kirouac said.
The new amended rules bring Winnipeg on-side with most major Canadian cities in allowing beekeeping in urban environments.
Urban beekeeping has been gaining popularity for a number of reasons, including concern about the drop in bee populations.
The Fort Garry Hotel made a request last May to allow five hives on its roof.
City of Winnipeg administration prepared an amendment to the downtown zoning bylaw that would allow beekeeping downtown.
The report addresses some concerns about bees, including saying honey bees are generally docile and only sting to protect the hive.
It also states hives already exist in the city of Winnipeg in areas zoned agricultural.
The report allows a maximum of four hives, plus one nucleus hive, for a total of five.
Hive openings should not be pointed towards balconies, patios or public spaces.
Hives that aren't on rooftops need to be behind two-metre-high fences.
If you follow the NBA, or even watch ESPN, you know something unusual is happening. Lebron James is having a spat with the media, well, one media figure in particular. For perhaps the first time Lebron has gone on record responding to media criticism. This criticism was placed by NBA TNT analyst and basketball legend, Charles Barkley.
The criticism was placed by Barkley after Lebron making a statement saying the Cleveland Cavaliers needed a playmaker. Barkley didn't like the way Lebron went about it. He felt that venting to the media about roster moves was inappropriate. In full Sir Charles had to say
“Inappropriate, whiny, all of the above, the Cleveland Cavaliers, they have given him everything he wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history. He wanted J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted [Iman] Shumpert last summer. They brought in Kyle Korver. He's the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He doesn't want to compete? He is an amazing player. They're the defending champs.”
Lebron took offense and, after staying silent about the media for years, responded. He bought up things of the past Barkley did. He said he was t going to let someone tarnish his legacy and that he had respected the league his whole career. James' response in full
“I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that, I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, ‘I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying. All I've done for my entire career is represented the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.”
James even responded to Barkley saying this era was too friendly.
“Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot, Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then.” James challenged Barkley even, “And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there, he knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile.”
Barkley responded, laughing it off and standing by what he said. “I stick by what I said, I'm not going to make this personal… he was all whiny last week,” Barkley said. “… I'm good and I'm straightforward, I'm never going to get personal on an NBA player.”
When asked if Lebron made it too personal, Barkley shrugged it off. The response
“I was laughing, clearly he did some homework … he Googled me and found some things. He was young when I was playing, so I appreciate that, but I'm not upset about it … my criticism was fair and I'm good with that.”
Who is the bad guy here? Was Barkley's criticism poorly placed and too harsh? Was Lebron wrong to cross the line like he did? This is part of the everlasting debate between the media and public figures.

When Sheldon McKenzie suffered an ultimately fatal head injury on an Ontario farm in January 2015, his recovery should have been the main concern. Instead, a liaison officer with the Jamaican consulate reportedly made great efforts to have McKenzie sent back to his native Jamaica as soon as possible. McKenzie was a migrant worker from Jamaica, one of thousands who come to Canada every year under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP).
Jamaican farmworker Sheldon McKenzie died in a Windsor, Ont. hospital last September. He was a 39-year-old husband and father of two teenage daughters. His Canadian relatives say he would likely never have received treatment here if not for the family's advocacy, writes Desmond Cole. ( McKenzie Family Photo )
Injured workers are bad for business and their experiences threaten the program's reputation in the Caribbean and Latin America countries where workers are recruited. Evidence suggests many workers who are hurt or become ill while in Canada are simply sent back home. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the SAWP and its shameful legacy needs to be addressed: we are treating the migrant workers who grow and harvest our food like disposable, subhuman units of labour. McKenzie died in a Windsor, Ont. hospital last September — he was 39 and leaves behind a wife and two teenage daughters. His Canadian relatives say he would likely never have received treatment here if not for the family's advocacy. According to Marcia Barrett, McKenzie's cousin and a Winnipeg resident, the Jamaican consulate liaison initially told the family McKenzie had suffered a stroke, not head trauma related to a workplace injury.

Barrett claims that same official told her McKenzie was available for so-called “medical repatriation,” and repeatedly checked with doctors to see if the injured worker, who had portions of his brain removed because of swelling and internal bleeding, was healthy enough to be flown to Kingston, Jamaica. Under the SAWP, foreign consulate liaisons and farm employers work together to decide which workers stay in Canada, which ones should be sent home and which can return the following season. Injured workers like McKenzie are of no further use to their bosses, or to Canada, and when their work permits expire, so do their health and Employment Insurance benefits. The SAWP exploits the labour of healthy workers and spits out those who become ill or injured while on the job in Canada. “I was 100 per cent confident he'd be sent home if we were not there,” said Barrett. “Why would you tell the family about medical repatriation? Why are you asking when his bone flap will be in place? This man was there fishing around, asking when Sheldon could be moved.” Barrett described her late cousin as “a very giving, happy, delightful young man.” She said the 12 years McKenzie spent travelling to Canada from Jamaica for work helped him raise a family, but they don't excuse the way he was treated in the months following his accident.
“The program was a great income blessing to my family, but just because you're working hard for something doesn't mean you should be abused,” Barrett said. MaryAnn Mihychuk, the federal minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, said this week she found it “shocking” that Canada doesn't track the fate of migrants workers who are injured here, and is vowing to review the SAWP.

According to a study by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, nearly 800 migrant workers were fired and sent home for medical reasons between 2001 and 2011. We don't know how many of these workers died because our government, in its indifference to the workers' lives, has failed to keep count. In fact, migrant advocate Chris Ramsaroop fears that prior to 2001, Canada did not even properly record the number of farmworkers who were sent home due to illness or injury. “There's never been an inquest into the death of a migrant worker,” Ramsaroop informed me in a phone interview. “We need to know what happened, not only in Sheldon's case, but in the case of every farmworker who has died.” Ramsaroop also pointed out that most of the workers in the SAWP are black and brown men from the global south. “This is a legacy of both slavery and indentureship. It's no coincidence that the same black and brown people that underwent slavery and indentureship are also going through this today.” In her review, Mihychuk will have plenty to consider: workers currently lack permanent immigration status, full health coverage, and access to Employment Insurance (even though EI payments are deducted from their wages). Hopefully she starts from the principle that migrant workers deserve the same protections as any Canadian labourer. Desmond Cole is a Toronto-based journalist. His column appears every Thursday.
On August 12, a driver drove his vehicle into a crowd of “anti-racist” protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 other individuals. The suspect has been identified as James Alex Fields, Jr.
Department of Memes reported that police officers in Charlottesville believed the driver was not acting maliciously, suggesting he was scared by the protesters on every side of his vehicle and he did not know what to do.
New shocking video has emerged that corroborates this theory.
Citizen researchers have slowed the video down and spotted an African American individual hitting the car with what appears to be a baseball bat before the suspect hit the crowd with his vehicle.
One such video posted to Streamable shows the driver slowing down, then accelerating quickly after his rear bumper is struck with the baseball bat.
The second video, originally posted to 4chan's /pol/, is a thorough examination of the events that seems to suggest the driver was behaving normally until his vehicle was struck with the bat.
Researchers on /pol/ corroborate the theory that the driver was not acting maliciously and was scared. Read more: https://t.co/iQdPCd0jSq pic.twitter.com/upYVjruaxv — God Emperor Trump (@realGETrump) August 13, 2017
The video freezes at multiple stages, the first at 0:02, to show a bicyclist on the sidewalk behaving normally.
The video then freezes at 0:04 to show the car being operated and normal speeds, and again at 0:10 to show the vehicle struck by what Department of Memes believes is a baseball bat.
The video then freezes at 0:14 to show the car attempt to brake and change direction, and once more at 0:19 as the mob closes in on the car and the driver speeds through them.
Last night it was revealed by a journalist who spoke to numerous officers at a police station in Charlottesville, Virginia that numerous officers believed the act was not malicious, and was done out of fear.
Anyway several police officers at the station here think the guy running people down wasn't malicious. They said the driver was scared — Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) August 12, 2017
To recap: The protesters were standing in the middle of the street, blocking traffic. The car was attacked with a blunt object resembling a baseball bat by a protester. The vehicle was not speeding until a protester attacked and the mob of people closed in on the driver.
If this story is confirmed, then the mainstream media's narrative about the driver being a white supremacist who sought to kill people at an anti-racism event will be fully blown out of the water.

There are a lot of “sacred cows” in nutritional science, none more so than the ubiquitous calorie hypothesis. Ask any ordinary nutritionist, dietary consultant, doctor, or medical researcher how people get fat and you will likely hear the same answer: People get fat because they take in more calories than they burn.
That's it. No discussion. No question. No problem.
Except it's wrong. And it is dangerous.
If you ask any of these same folks HOW this happens, HOW excess calories results in fat accumulation, you'll get less consistent and less confident answers. Some of them will throw out terms like “thermodynamics” or some other such ideas. Some will, flat out, not be able to explain how it happens, but they will all stick to their original answer.
The reason they are not really able to explain HOW excess calories adds to body fat is because there is no biological mechanism available to accomplish this feat. There is no molecule, no hormone, no enzyme available in the human body that takes “excess” calories and stores them as fat. It just doesn't happen.
Let's break it down a little more. A calorie isn't a physical thing, it's a measurement of energy. It measures the amount of energy needed to increase one cubic centimeter of water one degree celsius. Typically, when we see the term “calorie”, it is referring to a “kilocalorie”, which is the amount of energy needed to increase one liter of water one degree celsius.
Cal: measures energy needed to increase 1 cc 1 degree celsius
Kcal: measures energy needed to increase 1 liter 1 degree celsius
Okay, so a calorie isn't a thing…it's a measurement, and it's not the physiological method of fat accumulation . When you burn calories, you are basically increasing your core body temperature and heating up you body's water. But that isn't tied directly to fat (losing it or adding it).
The primary reason that he calorie hypothesis is wrong is that it's based upon physics, not biology. Using physics to explain biology results in inaccurate and dangerous consequences. For example, let's use physics to drag the calorie hypothesis to its logical conclusion.
Nutritional breakdown of calories in macronutrients is:
Carb: 4 kcal/gram
Protein: 4 kcal/gram
Fat: 9 kcal/gram
Alcohol: 7 kcal/gram
Nutritional breakdown of calories in alternative fuels:
Diesel: 11 kcal/gram
Jet fuel: 10 kcal/gram
Now, let's do a thought experiment. Let's suppose the calorie hypothesis is true (which it isn't), and let's suppose we have a test subject, we'll call him Not Fat Phil. Not Fat Phil wants to get fat. Given the above list of kcal/gram, and using strictly physics as our guide, clearly Not Fat Phil will want to begin a steady diet of Diesel and Jet fuel in order to gain fat. That's the surest way to get the most calories with the least amount of work.
Right?
Obviously not. But why? Because the body doesn't run on physics. It runs on biological pathways. Drinking diesel in order to gain weight would result in death, because diesel is poison. So the whole idea of calories as the mechanism for weight gain doesn't work because it's based on physics, but the body works on biology.
The other, more significant, thing, for me anyway, is that we have no accurate way of measuring exactly how many calories we eat or expend on any given day. As Gary Taubes illustrated, an extra 20 calories per day, over 20 years, will result in 40 pounds of extra fat. If we have to be so precise as to not overeat by 20 calories, the question isn't ‘Why are people fat?', but instead, ‘Why isn't everyone fat?'. Clearly, the calorie hypothesis fails, not only the logic test, but the common sense test, too.
The calorie hypothesis a “sacred cow” that is plainly false because it is based on a flawed paradigm. The truth is, it requires a complete paradigm shift in order to get a start on healthy, consistent, lifelong fat loss.

WEST LOOP — The owner of a West Highland white terrier stolen from a West Loop apartment is offering a $5,000 reward for his dog's safe return.
On May 18, Adam Johnston arrived home from work and waited to be greeted by 6½-year-old Barnaby. But when his beloved pet wasn't in his usual spot, Johnston started to look all over his apartment, moving furniture to try to find him.
"I panicked," said Johnston, 30. "He usually sits on the couch, and when I come in, he immediately runs to me."
After searching his apartment in the 100 block of North Canal Street, Johnston found his door had been pried open. Johnston was overcome with fear, wondering whether Barnaby, whom he has owned since he was 4 months old, was OK.
Johnston, who's been working with detectives to track down Barnaby, created a Facebook page to spread awareness about his stolen dog and is offering a $5,000 reward for his safe return.
Surveillance footage posted on YouTube by Johnston shows a man wearing a baseball hat and black clothing walking into the building through a garage door around 1:23 p.m. then walking out with the dog at 1:35 p.m.
Johnston said the dognapping is strange.
"I have a computer, a tablet, a bunch of other things, but they didn't take any of that. If they were breaking in for monetary gain, then there are easier things to take. I don't understand the motive."
"It's weird, it seemed too organized," Johnston added.
Now, a week since Barnaby was stolen, Johnston said he doesn't care about why his pooch was targeted; just that he wants him back.
"It sounds cliche, but he's my best friend," Johnston said. "He's who I come home to at night. Every weekend, I spend the whole day with him. I don't care what happened, I just want him back."
Anyone with information on the crime is asked to call police at 312-747-8380.

Why Having A Wallet Where You Own Your Private Keys Is Essential
Totle Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 16, 2017
If you keep up with current crypto events it seems that every month or so there is a new hack and millions in Bitcoins are stolen. In many of these cases, hundreds of Bitcoins were left on exchanges or mining pool wallets where these coins were more vulnerable — this is because you don't actually own your own private keys — the exchange does. This is just one of the many reasons why it's essential to keep your digital assets in a wallet where you have full control over your own private keys.
What is a private key?
A private key is a string of random characters used to secure the coins you hold in your wallet. This is the key that allows you to spend your cryptocurrency and it should never be shared with anyone. Giving someone your private key is like giving them a full set of keys to your crypto kingdom!
This private key goes hand-in-hand with a public key or wallet “address”. The private key allows you to verify that you have ownership over the public key and the coins connected to it. For instance, when someone wants to send you some cryptocurrency to your wallet they are sending it to the address or public key of your wallet that corresponds with the private key that you hold. This allows verification that you are the owner over this private key, and the crypto attached to it. This “trustless transfer” of cryptocurrency allows for two parties to make a transaction without a 3rd party and also without having to reveal your private key to the other person.
Owning your own private keys is an important aspect of any truly decentralized platform, whether it be an exchange, wallet, or intermediary like Coinbase. When you deposit ETH into the Totle Portfolio management system you have 100% control of your private keys, and no matter how many coins you diversify across, this never changes. Leaving your crypto in a location that doesn't let you own your private keys is like leaving your money in bags outside a bank.
Wallets we recommend
There are a ton of great wallets out there that allow you to hold onto your own private keys. When it comes to digital asset portfolio management systems like Totle, having a solid Ethereum based wallet is a must. Here are a few Ethereum based wallets that offer the option of owning your own private keys.
MetaMask — This is our go-to wallet for Ethereum based tokens and allows you to hold your own private keys. Working as a Chrome based plugin, it simply overlays on top of your browser and can be accessed easily and effortlessly when needed. The interface is simple, yet powerful, and MetaMask is a popular option for integration with Ethereum based decentralized apps or “DApps”. We recommend using it to enter the Totle Portfolio Tournament to interact with our platform! Ledger — This is one of the top hardware wallets on the market. It's is a physical device that looks similar to a USB key. It allows you to store your coins and ERC-20 tokens offline and is considered one of the most secure solutions for managing your crypto. Plus it integrates really well with the next online wallet on our list, MyEtherWallet. MyEtherWallet — This is one of the staple online wallets, but it is a little more tricky to use. It has a web interface as well as a Chrome extension and also works with Metamask. Exodus Wallet — A great desktop-only client that allows you to own your private keys. They have support for a wide variety of coins and the interface is absolutely beautiful. While they support a lot of coins, they don't yet support ERC-20 Tokens. A solid wallet for everyday use nonetheless.
As you can see there are quite a few options when it comes to choosing a wallet that is right for you. No matter what wallet you choose, it is good practice to make sure the wallet lets you hold your own private keys. No one just gives out their ATM PIN number or their login for their online banking account to random strangers to hold and the same should go for your private keys. Keep them secret and guard them close, because nothing is worse than waking up to an empty wallet! You have been warned!

Expect to see poké popping up everywhere this year. Sweetfin Poke/Facebook If you haven't yet heard of poké (pronounced POH-kay), that's bound to change soon.
A wave of restaurants serving this Hawaiian raw-food specialty is about to crash into the New York City — and national — dining scene, bringing the next new phenomenon in fast-casual food. Sorry, boring old salad and Chipotle: the tides are turning.
Poké is a mix of raw cubes of seafood (usually ahi tuna or salmon) in a soy sauce-based marinade. It's often garnished with seaweed, cucumber, avocado, or tobiko, and served over rice or greens. Ubiquitous in Hawaii — you can pick it up at grocery stores or even gas stations — poké is a deconstructed, flavorful version of sushi. It's also generally healthy, endlessly customizable, and very pretty.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) predicts that a bill aimed at reducing illegal immigration endorsed by President Trump will not gain enough votes to pass the Senate.
“That bill's not going to pass. … I think the White House knows that you don't have 60 votes for that in the Senate,” Rubio told CBS Miami.
Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), and Trump introduced the bill last week called the RAISE Act, which would overhaul our current legal immigration system into a “merit-based” points system, not unlike systems already in place in countries such as Canada and Australia.
The system prioritizes prospective legal immigrants with sought-after skills, education, or English language proficiency and would curb the number of green cards issued each year.
Despite Trump's promise to reform immigration and polls that show public support for a merit-based immigration system, the measure needs 60 votes to pass the Senate without a filibuster.
Rubio, who led the fight for amnesty for DREAMers, or children of illegal aliens allowed to come to the U.S. under the DREAM Act, said he opposes the cap on the number of people who can come to the U.S. with a green card.
“Where I probably have a big difference of opinion with this bill is that it sets an arbitrary cap on the number of people that are able to come through with a green card. I don't think that should be an arbitrary cap, that number should be driven by demand,” Rubio said.
Rubio was part of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of eight senators who pushed for legislation that would provide amnesty for illegal aliens in 2013 without a clear timeline of when immigration laws would start to be enforced.
Rubio said the 2013 proposal for legal immigration also had a merit-based points system but did not go as far as the RAISE Act.
“In 2013, the very controversial “Gang of Eight,” four Democrats and four Republicans, proposed moving legal immigration to a merit-based system,” Rubio said. “It wouldn't be entirely merit-based, but it would be more merit-based and it has to be in the 21st century.”
It can make you feel extremely nervous when a police officer performs a routine action like touching your tail light. You might wonder if your vehicle is damaged or if the officer is extra-suspicious of you because he thinks you've done something seriously wrong. The goods news is that tapping the tail light has very little to do with the reason why you were stopped. It's more about protecting the police officer than incriminating you.
Tip A cop touches your tail light to leave fingerprint evidence in case she needs to prove that a stop occurred.
Touching the Car Proves the Stop Occurred
When a police officer touches your tail light or bumper, she leaves fingerprint and DNA evidence behind. This provides critical evidence so investigators can place the vehicle and its owner at the scene in case you try to flee. Tapping the tail light establishes a physical connection between the vehicle and the police officer. This is especially relevant if the police officer is attacked or injured during a routine stop.
It's a Safety Precaution
So why the tail light? Why not the trunk, which is larger and far more easily accessible? Tapping the tail light keeps the police officer to the side of the vehicle and not directly behind it. This keeps him out of harm's way should the driver start to back up.
Approaching from the side is also the best position for an officer to see the driver's lap area and the back seat to assess whether any weapons are visible. This is especially relevant for one-officer patrol units when there's no second officer to maintain a safety watch on the occupants of the vehicle.
Cops Can Spot Evidence in Plain View
It's not unusual for people to try to hide illegal drugs or weapons after they've been pulled over. Tapping the back of a car helps to distract criminals and stop them hiding something.
Generally, a police officer can only search a car if you consent or if the officer sees suspicious items sitting in plain view. If the police officer distracts you before you have time to stash the goods, the police can seize the items and conduct a more thorough search. The police report an increase in arrest rates for intoxicated drivers and those found to be in possession of prohibited substances and unlicensed firearms when tail light tapping techniques are used.
Old Habits Die Hard
It's also possible that a police officer might simply tap your tail light out of habit, particularly if he's been on the force for a while. There are traffic cameras all over most city streets, and most law enforcement vehicles now come fully equipped with cameras and other technology that can prove that the police officer was present at the scene. Touching the tail light has become an obsolete, unnecessary step.
There's also an argument that tapping the vehicle exposes the police officer's location in relation to the car, making him more vulnerable to attack. Some police departments now discourage police officers from tail light tapping.
A Salvadorean nun who said she had no idea she was pregnant gave birth in Italy this week after she felt stomach cramps in her convent and was rushed to hospital, Italian media reported on Friday.
The 31-year-old mother and her baby boy, who weighs 3.5 kilograms (7.7 pounds), are doing well and other new mothers in Rieti hospital have begun collecting clothes and donations for her, the reports said.
"I did not know I was pregnant. I only felt a stomach pain," the nun was quoted as saying at the hospital, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
La Repubblica said she gave birth on Wednesday.
ANSA said the nun had named her baby Francesco (Francis) -- also the pope's chosen title and one of the most popular names in Italy, where St Francis of Assisi is the much-loved national patron saint.
The hospital could not be reached for comment.
The nun belongs to the "Little Disciples of Jesus" convent in Campomoro near Rieti, which manages an old people's home and reports said she would keep the baby.
Her fellow nuns were quoted saying they were "very surprised".
Distressed personality type, or "type D" individuals, tend to suppress powerful negative emotions as a means of coping with stressful events or situations. These individuals suppress feelings of anger or sorrow even when they are in an environment that is supportive of emotional expression, such as suppressing anger when clearly justified, or refusing to cry at a funeral. The type D individual tends to be anxious, irritable, insecure, and uncomfortable with strangers. These types of people are constantly experiencing and anticipating negative emotions, which results in their being more tense and inhibited around others.
History [ edit ]
The type D personality was defined in the 1990s, describing individuals who experience feelings of negativity, depression, anxiety, stress, chronic anger, and loneliness. The distressed personality type is also prone to pessimism, low self-esteem, and difficulty making personal connections with others. It is thought that about 20% of otherwise-healthy Americans fall under this category.[1]
In 1996, Dr. Denollet reported a longitudinal study of 286 men and women who had enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program. At the beginning of the program, each participant filled out a questionnaire in order to determine whether they fell under the type D pattern. Eight years later, researchers tracked down the participants in order to find out who had died, and who was still alive. Among those who had been classified as type D, 27% had died; meanwhile only 7% of the non-Ds had died. The majority of these deaths were due to heart disease or stroke. Since this study, the type D personality subtype has been thought to be associated with early death, increased risk for developing cardiovascular problems, poorer response to proven treatments for heart disease, and increased chances of sudden cardiac arrest.[2]
Diagnostic criteria [ edit ]
A 14-question scale is used to determine whether an individual can be categorized as having a type D personality type. This scale, the D-Scale 14, aims to measure negativity as well as social inhibition. Each of the 14 items on the scale is rated according to a 5 point Likert scale, from 0 to 4 (false to true). Individuals who score high (above a 10) on both negativity and social inhibition can be classified as type D.[2]
This questionnaire was developed based on the idea that individuals who score high on negative affectivity are dysphoric and have a negative view of self. They are also prone to more somatic symptoms, and focus more on negative situations and stimuli. Scoring high on social inhibition means that these individuals tend to avoid the potential 'dangers' involved in social interactions, such as disapproval. Generally speaking, social situations tend to make type D individuals feel inhibited, tense, uncomfortable, and insecure.
Health risks [ edit ]
A wide variety of health risks are associated with type D personalities, primarily due to the fact that they seem to lead to a more highly activated immune system and therefore, more inflammation. This increase in inflammation can often lead to damaged blood vessels throughout the heart and body. Type D individuals have also been found to have higher blood pressure than normal, as well as an exaggerated response to stress, both physiological and psychological.[2]
Among the health issues commonly associated with this personality subtype are depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. Additionally, type Ds are might have a predisposition to social phobia, panic disorder, and even the development of avoidant personality disorder.[3]
According to Dr. Denollet, what most likely links poor health outcomes to the type D personality subtype is the distinctly high level of stress associated with it. Unlike other personality types who like to vent, type Ds social inhibition leaves them with no such outlet for their stress. This pent-up stress causes high cortisol levels, which, in turn, can lead to high blood pressure as well as chronic, artery-damaging inflammation. It is worth noting that another possible explanation for this correlation is that type Ds likely also suffer from depression, anxiety, and poor social connections, each of which has been linked with poor health and heart disease.[1]
Cardiovascular complications [ edit ]
Both type D dimensions (negative affectivity and social inhibition) are associated with a stress-induced increase in cortisol release. High levels of cortisol are thought to be the mediating factor in the association between this personality type and the increased risk for coronary heart disease.
Additionally, the inhibition of emotions that characterizes type D personality types is strongly associated with higher cardiovascular reactivity, lower cardiovascular recovery, lower heart rate variability, carotid atherosclerosis, incidence of coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality. The correlation between emotional suppression and cardiovascular complications has been observed in numerous different studies, including one that involved patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. In this study, deaths from cardiac causes were increased by a factor of four in those with type D personality, even after controlling for conventional risk factors.
Another study, conducted by Appels et al, investigated the effect of type D behavior on sudden cardiac death. This study involved interviewing the next-of-kin of the sudden cardiac death victims to determine whether they were type D or not. Patients scoring high on negative affectivity and social inhibition (the two dimensions of the type D personality subtype) were found to be seven times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death.[3]

In a patch of grass along the Gulf Coast, a Texas field cricket rubs his wings together to produce his characteristic "chirp." He's playing a courting song to attract the attention of a nearby female. His advances work and she approaches. After brushing each other with their antennae, the pair get down to business. The female mounts the male to receive a packet of sperm that he has released onto his abdomen, and that will pump sperm into her for the next half hour.
It all seems perfectly normal — for bug sex, anyway — but there's actually something amiss here. Our six-legged Romeo is sterile, and his partner will soon be infertile. Her innards will become swollen and blue, and she won't produce any eggs from their tryst. There's no bouncing baby crickets on the way, and no happy ending to this romance. Except, that is, for a particular virus that has encouraged these star-crossed lovers to mate.
The virus, known as IIV-6/CrIV, benefits from the cricket's copulation because it spreads through sexual contact. And what's more, the virus promoted that contact in the first place, according to a new study.
It's a brilliant bit of behavior modification, similar to strategies employed by other viruses and parasites that can only flourish if their hosts do certain things. Rabies makes its hosts more aggressive so the virus can be spread by bites. Hairworms turn their grasshopper hosts into suicide jumpers so they can get to water. Some wasps force spiders to build weird webs to support their cocoons. All of this is done via chemical warfare waged on the host's central nervous system. A little venom here, or a tweak in hormone levels there, and the brain and body are hijacked for the parasite's own ends.
Biologist Shelley Adamo came across it in her lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia when some of the crickets she kept there stopped laying eggs. She dissected some of the crickets and found that their fat bodies — an organ that stores fats and produces proteins for the immune system — were bloated and had turned blue. A peek through a microscope revealed that the organs were full of hexagonal viral particles that had packed themselves into a crystalline shape, which gave the fat body an eerie blue sheen.
The fat body is the perfect headquarters for interfering with communication between the immune system and the nervous system, and for altering its host's behavior and physiology.
And that's just what the virus did. The infected crickets could forget any chance of being parents. Adamo found that the females all had fewer than ten eggs inside them, while some had none. In contrast, a healthy cricket can usually hold more than a hundred. The males still produced sperm, but the cells were either severely crippled or entirely immobile. This kind of "parasitic castration" can help viruses and parasites secure more of the host's bodily resources for themselves without killing the host or hurting its ability to attract mates.
Despite their reproductive shortcomings, the crickets still wanted to mate. In fact, the males seemed more eager to get it on than usual. When Adamo and her team paired the crickets up, healthy, uninfected males waited around 10 minutes before they started serenading a female. Ones that were sick with a bacterial infection waited around 13 minutes — they were clearly not in the mood. Males that were infected with IIV-6/CrIV, on the other hand, didn't slow down at all. They actually started the mating game faster, taking only about three minutes to get courting. Meanwhile, the females, whether they had the virus or not, all mounted the males and took their broken sperm in the same amount of time.
The researchers think that the accelerated mating is a behavioral change forced by the virus so that it can be transmitted from cricket to cricket. About half of the infected-uninfected pairings led to the virus being spread. In some cases, the virus didn't even need the crickets to have sex, and hopped host-to-host while the insects nuzzled antennae during courtship.
The virus has another trick up its sleeve. Mucking with the crickets' immune system not only speeds up their courtship, but also keeps them in good enough shape to attract a mate. Animals that are sick usually won't put much, or any, effort into mating. They'll also often stop eating and lose weight while their immune systems fight off the infection. Other animals will pick up on these signs and avoid mating with sick suitors. That would be a dead end for a sexually transmitted infection, but the crickets with IIV-6/CrIV didn't show any of these "sickness behaviors" and were still attractive enough get other crickets to mate. They maintained their weight and went about their day as normal, the researchers think, because the virus keeps their fat bodies from producing the immune signals that tell them to do otherwise.
Adamo and her team aren't sure how IIV-6/CrIV does any of this, but they think it is at least partly attributable to a reduction in the host's overall protein content and the activity of virucidal enzymes. That would explain the lack of sickness behaviors, but not the males' speedy courting. Researchers will need to observe some more poor crickets mating futilely to fully understand the virus' exploitation of cricket sex.
Richard of Pudlicott (died 1305), also known as Richard de Podelicote (or Pudlicote, or Dick Puddlecote), was an English wool merchant who, down on his luck, became an infamous burglar of King Edward I's Wardrobe treasury at Westminster Abbey in 1303. Richard, along with high-ranked accomplices, stole a large portion of the king's treasury of gems, antique gold and coins, estimated at over 100,000 pounds, or about equal to a year's tax revenue for the Kingdom of England. When priceless objects began flooding pawn shops, houses of prostitution and even fishing nets in the River Thames, the king and his ministers, away at war in Scotland, were alerted. Many dozens of people were rounded up and jailed in a wide and indiscriminate net and eventually brought to one of the biggest trials of the High Middle Ages in England. Ultimately most of the loot was recovered and a dozen or so were hanged, including Richard, but most escaped the executioner: Richard gave a false confession that he was the only one involved, saving the clergy—his inside accomplices—from being condemned. After his hanging, his body was flayed, and legend said his skin was nailed to the door of Westminster Abbey as a warning to other would-be criminals. A 2005 study of the door, dating back to the reign of King Edward I (making it the oldest door in England) revealed the legend to be false. The fragments of hide found under the door's lone surviving iron strap turned out to be from an animal hide which once covered the door.[1][2]
Legacy [ edit ]
Pudlicott is featured in a BBC TV movie titled Heist (2008) made about the events of 1303. His character was played by Kris Marshall.

ESPN and CBS Sports have released updated brackets and we'll continue to track the minutae of each bracketology update so you don't have to.
We're now in the final few days of the regular season. All 10 Big East teams play their final games on Saturday before the Big East Tournament gets underway next Wednesday. There are a lot of bubbles bouncing around in the air right now and both national media members and bracket aggregating sites like BracketMatrix.com are pumping out lots of predictions and content as conference tournament season rapidly approaches for all the power conferences. Let's take a look at where Providence, their non-conference opponents and the rest of the Big East stands in the latest bracketology.

Providence took care of business in their final home game of the season on Tuesday night with a win over DePaul. The Friars finish the regular season at Madison Square Garden on Saturday against St. John's. A win against the Red Storm means Providence would have 10 or more wins in Big East play in all four season of the current league configuration. More importantly, it would likely lock up Providence's at-large spot. A loss wouldn't necessarily knock the Friars out of the field of 68 but it would mean they would have to do some extra work in the Big East Tournament next week.

The Wildcats got their second “bye” week of Big East play to finish the season so they haven't played a game since Saturday when they defeated Creighton at the Pavilion. Jay Wright's crew finishes the season Saturday at Georgetown and Villanova will again be the #1 seed in the Big East Tournament with their first game next week being on Thursday against the winner of St. John's and Georgetown. Those teams are locked into the 8/9 game at this point.

Butler, like Villanova, got their second “bye” week of the Big East schedule this final week of the season. The Bulldogs last played on Sunday at Xavier and defeated the Musketeers. That extended Butler's winning streak to 4 games with the regular season finale upcoming on Saturday at Hinkle Fieldhouse against Seton Hall. Chris Holtmann will garner a lot of votes for Big East Coach of the Year with that award being announced next week before the Bulldogs play the winner of Xavier and DePaul in the 7/10 game next week at the Big East Tournament.

Xavier continues to be in a free fall with six straight losses locking them into the 7 seed meaning they have to play DePaul next Wednesday night in the Big East Tournament for the right to play against Butler on Thursday night. In addition to the losing streak hurting the Musketeers in the league standings, they have slipped from comfortably in to dangerously on the bubble. Chris Mack needs to right the ship and he and his team will have a chance to beat DePaul on Saturday and then again next week to try to regain some confidence and footing to make a run in NYC.

“This is a feisty crowd. What did you all eat this morning?” Mr. Obama said, speaking over applause that lingered for several minutes. “Whatever you had for breakfast, I want it.”
Mr. Obama made other stops throughout the eastern portion of the state, and on Sunday evening he staged a rally in Scranton, where Mrs. Clinton has deep family roots, and was accompanied by a native son of the city, Senator Bob Casey.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was also among those campaigning across Pennsylvania for Mr. Obama on Sunday.
The final weekend push of campaigning occurred as polls showed a contest that appeared to be running tighter in the state.
A poll released Sunday, conducted for McClatchy Newspapers, MSNBC and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, showed that Mrs. Clinton lead Mr. Obama by a margin of 48 to 43 percentage points. Eight percent were still undecided, according to the poll taken April 17-18. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

Mrs. Clinton began her day of campaigning with a stop at Bonnet Lane restaurant in Abington, Pa., in the battleground Philadelphia suburbs, where she conducted local interviews and shook hands with voters, many of them undecided.
Erika Wimms, of Abington, was eating breakfast with her family and said that even though the primary was only two days away, she still could not commit to either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama.
“I am so torn,” she said. “My husband and I have been watching the debates; we've been dialoguing about it over and over. They're both so similar in what they want to do. I just can't decide.”

Mrs. Clinton headed next to Bethlehem, the first of three rallies planned for Sunday, where she emphasized differences between her and Mr. Obama.
“I'm offering leadership you can count on,” she said. “You know where I stand, you know what I've done, you know what I will do.”
Mark Nevins, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania, said Mrs. Clinton was focusing on areas populated by blue-collar, working-class voters, many in former steel towns that have suffered from the loss of manufacturing jobs.
Mr. Obama was also the target of attacks from Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, who highlighted Mr. Obama's past relationship with William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground.
“If you're going to associate and have as a friend and serve on a board and have a guy kick off your campaign that says he's unrepentant, that he wished bombed more,” Mr. McCain said on “This Week” on ABC. “Then, the worst thing of all, that, I think, really indicates Senator Obama's attitude, is he had the incredible statement that he compared Mr. Ayers, an unrepentant terrorist, with Senator Tom Coburn, Senator Coburn, a physician who goes to Oklahoma on the weekends and brings babies into life — comparing those two — I mean, that's not — that's an attitude, frankly, that certainly isn't in keeping with the overall attitude.”
They can do math, paint canvases, and when I was in Thailand, I saw one play the harmonica. Which begs the question: could elephants get any cooler? New findings say yes, indeed. Apparently elephants may also hold the genetic key that could potentially help in the battle to cure to cancer, and Israeli and American researchers are joining forces to find out more.
Last week researchers from the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, after a collaboration with Primary Children's Hospital and Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City, along with Ringling Bros. Center for Elephant Conservation, published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, revealing some startling information about cancer resistance in elephants.
According to the report, less than 5% of elephants die from cancer; the cancer mortality rate among humans, however, ranges from 11 to 25%. Since elephants, the largest terrestial animals on this planet, have 100 times more cells in their bodies than humans one could presume that makes them 100 times more susceptible to cancerous cell mutations. But apparently that's not the case. Pediatric oncologist at the University of Utah, Dr. Joshua Schiffman explained in the journal: “By all logical reasoning, elephants should be developing a tremendous amount of cancer, and in fact, should be extinct by now due to such a high risk for cancer.”
How then do elephants defy all odds? According to a University of Utah report, elephants have 40 copies of a gene “that encodes P53, a well-defined tumor suppressor,” while humans have only two.
Further, elephants may have a more robust mechanism for killing damaged cells that are at risk for becoming cancerous. In isolated elephant cells, this activity is doubled compared to healthy human cells, and five times that of cells from patients with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, who have only one working copy of p53 and more than a 90 percent lifetime cancer risk in children and adults. The results suggest extra p53 could explain elephants' enhanced resistance to cancer.
And now, Israeli Professor Avi Schroeder and a team of super scientists from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa are jumping on board. Four months ago, Schiffman was making a presentation on Huntsman's findings in Haifa and Schroeder was there. “As I was listening to his lecture I made a note to myself that I had to meet him,” Schroeder told Haaretz.
Schroeder and his team want to take Schiffman's work to the next level, hoping to concoct a new anti-cancer drug. “The goal is to create a new treatment and a new treatment approach. The P53 is one of the most important mechanisms in cancer and it's relevant to almost all types of cancer. We hope that we have here a harbinger of a new treatment,” Schroeder said.

Tess Cutler is an intern at Tablet.
After bolting the latch of the toilet's door, Thupten Ngodup took a deep breath, opened the cap of the gasoline canister, poured the pale liquid to the last drop on his head till he was soaked to the skin, flicked a lighter and turned into an orange ball of fire. With pieces of flesh bursting off his body with cracking sounds and raging flames licking his hair and searing his skin, he staggered like an inferno, screaming something that sounded like "Independence". As people ran towards him to dowse the flames, Ngodup went down on his knees with his hands folded, praying even as the blaze seethed from under the rugs thrown on him. A few days after his self-immolation bid at the hunger strike by Tibetans at Jantar Mantar in Delhi in April 1998, Ngodup became a martyr for his "homeland" and a hero for his people living in exile. He was cremated with a secret still buried in his heart.
A few days later, amid a debate on "deviating from the Middle Way of the Dalai Lama" within the Tibetan community, a few people walked to Ngodup's eight-by-six feet shack near the Tsechokling monastery in Dharamsala where the 60-year-old man worked as a cook till the day he took a bus to Delhi to join the fast-unto-death to attract the UN's attention to the "Chinese atrocities in Tibet". Amidst the Dalai Lama's photos, Tibetan flags, Buddha statues, prayer bowls, a chair, some clothes, a bed, three pots, a few empty bottles of rum and an untouched bundle of bidis was hidden Ngodup's little secret: the man was a former Tibetan guerrilla fighter. He had picked up a rifle and carried it for 13 years to fight the Chinese in Tibet.
Thupten Ngodup's little secret is a monstrous truth that lives in the hearts of almost all Tibetans in exile. Every monk humming a mantra under a tree, every hand counting notes at a sweater shop, every face staring at customers in a caf��, every finger turning a rosary in a temple knows this: With guns in their hands, radios in their pockets and poison capsules hanging around their necks, thousands of Tibetan guerrillas ��� many of them trained by the CIA ��� went into Tibet to fight the People's Liberation Army for 15 long years. Most of them never returned.
Those who survived the deadly battles and came back home just faded away in the narrow alleys of refugee settlements. Many of them are still active: making tea in a restaurant, selling books in a shop, weaving carpets in a factory, writing articles for their cause or just turning the prayer wheel in their grizzled hands. Some of them live in grey stone dwellings on the ridge of green mountains, with red and yellow prayer flags fluttering over their little huts. They talk about their fight with pride. Then they sink into bitterness. "The CIA just used us for its own dirty games with the Chinese," says Tsering, a former guerrilla, with a glint in his old eye. "Then the Americans betrayed us. The Nepalis stabbed us in the back. Everyone dumped us," he adds, as his eyes turn red.
Latin America at a glance…what makes this part of the world so unique, enticing and unforgettable? Read on and find out!
Latin America is a term commonly used to describe all the countries in both American continents where Romance languages are most predominant. Comprising most of the nations of South and Central America, as well as Mexico and the Caribbean hubs of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, Latin America is a colourful kaleidoscope of countries, ancient cultures, and magnificent nature. Combined, they make up a phenomenal portion of our world wonders, from the most famous archaeological ruins to the most awe-inspiring mountain ranges, as well as luscious rainforests, vibrant capital cities, and a host of exotic cultures. Although you may be inclined to think of Latin America as an homogenous region, you'll find its diversity astounding. It's this very diversity which makes travel through Latin America so immensely rewarding.
Here's Latin America at a glance:
Geography
Latin America covers an area of just over 19 million square kilometres, or about 1/8th of the earth's land surface. This is a land of extreme geographical distinctions which have created a mind-boggling biodiversity that's unparalleled anywhere else on earth. The ecosystems here range from equatorial and tropical, to subtropical, semi-arid, Mediterranean, and even subpolar, spawning unique flora and fauna species throughout this mammoth region. Latin America is also a region of superlatives, home to the world's most extensive mountain range (the Andes), and river (the Amazon River), the tallest waterfall (Angel), as well as the driest place (the Atacama Desert), the most species-rich rainforest (the Amazon) and the largest wetlands (the Pantanal), the latter arguably the best wildlife viewing destination of all.
Demographics
Home to an estimated 626,700,000 people, Latin America is regarded as the most urbanized part of our world, with over 80% of people living in cities. In total, 25 countries and territories make up this region, and although they may share similar traits, their diverse topography and histories have ensured each remains distinguishable. The largest country in Latin America is Brazil, the smallest Suriname, whose entire population (just over half a million) is but 1/15th that of Mexico City alone. (Caveat: in the strictest sense of the term, Latin America should not include Suriname, whose main language is Dutch, yet for general travel purposes this is still very much considered a Latin American country.)
The predominant religion in Latin America is Christianity (almost 90%), and although Spanish and Portuguese are spoken by the overwhelming majority (605 and 24% respectively) an array of other languages also exist, most of them indigenous. Bolivia alone, for example, recognizes some 40-odd languages, only one of which is of European descent. Some of the most fascinating indigenous languages are found in the Caribbean, where the fusion of various languages has created innumerable creole derivatives, which are either European, Arabic or Asian-language based.
About 80% of Latin Americans are of European descent, although Asian and African ancestry is also common. The sheer number of ethnic groups make this part of the world one of the culturally the richest regions to explore.
Ancient culture
In this region lived some of the most sophisticated ancient civilizations in our world, and the incredible archaeological ruins of the Incas, Maya, Aztecs, Toltecs, Nazca and Chimu (among many others) attract millions of visitors each year. People come here in search of cultural and historical enlightenment, and find their wishes more than fulfilled. Alongside the most world-renowned cultural attractions – sites like Machu Picchu, Tulum, Copan, the Nazca Lines and Chan Chan (one of the many hidden treasures in northern Peru) – you can discover countless treasured sites which may be lesser known outside the region, but are just as wonderful to explore. Sometimes, even more so, because sites are way off the tourist trail, in remote and unspoiled regions which offer the opportunity to indulge in sightseeing as well as enjoy some of the most outstanding landscapes in Latin America.
Modern people
Nowadays, with the concoction of foreign cultures added to the mix, thanks to the sheer number of migrants from every corner of the globe over the last 4 centuries, Latin America displays some of the most vibrant and eclectic cultural fusion you're likely to encounter. When old worlds meet new, we are gifted a tremendous amount of diversity and this is, primarily, what makes this region so very unique. Indigenous influence is everywhere…it's in the folkloric costumes, in the hues of the textiles, in the dances, the music, the language, and all the festivals and traditions which Latin Americans hold so dear. A proud and conservative people, Latin Americans have triumphed where so many others have failed: they've maintained the integrity of their roots whilst incorporating modernity, immigration, and diversity. Head to the highlands of Peru, for example, and you'll meet plenty of locals who speak Spanish and go to church on Sundays, yet still revere Pachamama – the Inca goddess of the earth – and ritually make food offerings to her.
At times, it may seem that it's hard to pinpoint exactly where old ends and new begins, or where native ends and adopted begins, and because there were so many different influences in different parts of Latin America, it also means that no two countries in the region are the same. They share much, of course, in terms of culture. Generally speaking, Latin Americans are warm and welcoming, they are passionate, somewhat hot-headed and always ingenious. They love food, family, and football, with music and dance an inherent part of everyday life. Latin Americans can also be surprisingly avant-garde and individualistic when you least expect it. Argentina was the first country in South America to legalize gay marriage in 2010 (homosexuality was decriminalized throughout much of Latin America in the late 1800s), Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949 in favour of a complete eco-friendly existence, and Bolivia was the first country in Latin America to send McDonald's burger chain packing when profits failed to materialize. Bolivia is renowned for its excellent street food and seducing locals with bright lights and big names is obviously harder than one might first imagine.
Influences from Africa have radically shaped the Caribbean region, Central America, and much of northern South America. Asian fusion, instead, can be mostly seen in Peru, Brazil and Venezuela. The resulting local cuisines are as delectable and the music is hypnotizing. In most Peruvian cities, chifa – a hybrid between local and Cantonese culinary traditions – is absolutely everywhere.
Curious to discover more about Latin America? Then don't just glance…go! We offer a variety of tours to suit all tastes, ages and budgets, to just about every corner of this incredible part of the world. From luxury cruises sailing the Amazon River to heart-pumping hikes along the ancient Inca Trail and an impressive array of fun, interesting, active, relaxing and utterly unforgettable adventure tours through Mexico, Central America and South America. We can have you ziplining your way through Costa Rica's pristine rainforests, retracing Charles Darwin's steps in the superlative Galapagos Islands, exploring ancient pyramids in Mexico and learning to dance the tango in Buenos Aires…among countless other amazing experiences.

After a heart attack, even a brief delay in getting medical attention may mean the difference between life and death. A new study suggests that being married is a significant factor in getting treatment faster — but only for men.
Researchers in Canada checked how long it took for 4,401 heart attack victims, 1,486 of them women, to arrive at treatment after the onset of chest pain. In a study published online on Monday in The Canadian Medical Association Journal, the scientists defined late arrival as a delay of six hours or more from the onset of pain to the beginning of treatment.
On average, married heart attack victims arrived at the hospital half an hour sooner than those who were not married. But when the researchers analyzed the data separately for men and women, they found that while married men were more than 60 percent less likely to arrive late than their single peers, there was no statistically significant difference between married and single women.
“Wives are more likely to take the caregiver role and advise their husbands to go to the E.R.,” said Dr. Clare L. Atzema, the lead author and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Toronto. “But as my husband put it, even if I wasn't there telling him to go to the hospital, he'd hear my voice telling him to do so. Even when they're not there, women have a pronounced effect.”
There's a mental picture you can't un-see. Former Jeb Bush Communications Director and current anti-Trump PAC flack Tim Miller is on a mission to stop Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, and what better way than to channel Trump in TV interviews? Miller followed Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on MTP Daily, and explained to host Chuck Todd just how badly Republicans would lose if Trump becomes the nominee:
I was listening to the Robby Mook interview, that you did right before this, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager? That guy has got to be giddy. If Donald Trump wins the nomination, he can come down here to Miami and work on his tan. To use a Trumpian term, Hillary, is going to schlong him in the general election. It's gonna be an absolute route. For our purposes, as voters learn more and more about it, and realize the importance of stopping him, especially if it gets to a one-on-one matchup, this is a guy that can be stopped in one-on-one matchups, we just have to get there.
In case you missed it, here's the Trump remark Miller was referencing, from December:
That comment touched off an intense debate over the meaning of the word “schlong” between Donald Trump and everyone else in the world.
Speaking of getting schlonged, though, Tim Miller's PAC, along with two others, dumped millions of dollars into Florida to stop Trump, but only managed to increase his margin in the polls ahead of a 20-point victory. There's another metaphor here about something in your own eye, and something in your neighbor's eye, but that's another story.

#NeverTrumper Gasparino Says “Neo-Nazis, Klansmen” Make Up Trump's Margin of Victory
#NeverTrumper Charlie Gasparino Says White Supremacists Make Significant Portion of Trump Supporters
AGAIN — Never Trust a NeverTrumper — They will turn on President Trump on a dime. They are as bad as Democrats.
They still hold a tremendous amount of rage that Americans rejected their failed ideas.
Charlie Gasparino is a huge Donald Trump critic. On Saturday President Trump condemned the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia after rioting and clashes took place between neo-Nazis and antifa leftists. One woman was killed when a white supremacist ran over a group of leftists. The media immediately attacked Trump for including the leftist violence in his statement. The left does not typically report on far left violence although it is pervasive in today's America. The #NeverTrumpers soon joined the left in condemning Trump after the rioting and attacks.
Charlie Gasparino: I really think that Donald Trump really believes that this sort of far right people who are a coalition of uber-nationalists, neo-Nazis, klansmen that they are a margin of victory in his coalition.
This guy spouts off unconfirmed nonsense like this and claims he's a Republican?
Via Cavuto Coast to Coast:
A German scientist is raising serious questions as to whether government data-keepers have been tampering with scientific data to conjure up warming trends where none exist.
“It is important to understand whether CO2 truly causes climate change,” said Professor Dr. Friedrich-Karl Ewert, “We rely entirely on simulation models. Reality looks very different from simulations.”
Dr. Ewert is professor emeritus of geophysics at the University of Paderborn. He spoke at a scientific conference put on by EIKE, the European Institute for Climate and Energy in Essen, Germany that was co-sponsored by CFACT and the Heartland Institute.
Ewert conducted exhaustive research comparing climate computer models to real world temperature. His findings confirm what others have concluded, that the models run far hotter than measured observations. He points out that the UN IPCC likes to carefully select the dates and data it presents, but that, “if we look at temperature changes over a larger period, any temperature trend disappears.”
In the course of his research, Ewert found something shocking.
“In 2012, we realized that the data offered by NASA was not the same as that offered in 2010. The data had been altered. If in 2010 someone had, for instance, looked up the data for Palma de Mallorca, they would have seen a cooling of .0076 degrees. But in 2012 it suddenly showed a temperature increase of .0074 degrees. This is not a one-off.”
“Until then measurements were sacrosanct. Can you call it fraud or falsification? I'm not a lawyer, but I can say it has been changed retroactively. If I show you the data a negative judgment is justified. In 2012 there was twice as much warming in the sample we examined compared with just two years prior.”
Warming campaigners have been confounded by a lack of any global warming since last century. This contradicts large numbers of computer model projections that warming should have occurred. They've attempted to gloss over this inconvenient fact by trumping up records. They routinely claim some period of time as the “hottest ever,” in the expectation that the casual observer will never realize that their records are set by meaningless hundredths of a degree. These tiny measurements run far below the margin of error. Even the word “hottest” is unjustified. Global temperature has been running around one half degree above baseline with just a few years above. Nothing hot about that.
It is fundamental to the scientific method that scientists must adapt their conclusions to fit their data. They must never alter their data to serve a favored conclusion.
In just a few hours we expect negotiators at COP 21, the UN climate conference in Paris to announce a final climate agreement that will shift global power, harm economies, redistribute fortunes and cost trillions of dollars. It is ever increasingly apparent that that deal rests on false promises and false premises.
Dr. Ewert presents a powerful case. If we cannot trust the keepers of the scientific data taxpayers paid for, what is there about global warming we can trust?
Fairy tales, for me, have always evoked powerful feelings of the mysterious and mist-shrouded history of European peoples. Both before and after coming to White racial consciousness, there was always something “enchanting,” to use a word, about the tales and their faraway castles, strange creatures and ever-present dark woods. Like a non-Jewish version of the Old Testament, they were filled with sex, violence and the occasional morality lesson.
Also like the Old Testament, there's a noticeable “flatness” to the fairy tales. There is no drama or character development to speak of, just matter-of-fact recitations of what happens next. Uncensored, politically incorrect — folklore in the raw. Given that, I had to wonder how, exactly, the Jews of old Europe would have been considered at the time these tales were being passed around.
The Annotated Brothers Grimm, a Christmas present to my children, lets us know.
The book, published in 2004 and annotated by Harvard scholar Maria Tatar, presents the tales in their originally published form in 1857. It's got well-known tales like Rapunzel, Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood, as well as more obscure ones.
In the back, there is an “adult” section that includes a heretofore censored tale, “The Jew in the Brambles.” In the tale, a Jewish merchant is forced to dance by a magic violin while stuck in a thicket of painful brambles. Safe to say, Jews are not presented sympathetically in the tale. The player of the magic violin, an honest servant who got the violin from a gnome, tells the Jew, “You've skinned people plenty of times. Now the brambles can give you a scraping.” Only when the Jews offers his sack of coins does the torture stop.
From there, the Jew is portrayed as mouthy, a tattletale (he complains about the torture to the local judge). Ultimately, he is hanged as a thief for having stolen the coins himself in the first place. (Loud but hypocritical complaints about injustice and running to the authorities for punishment of enemies do seem to be Jewish attributes that continue to this day.) Tatar tells us that “anti-Semitism in its most virulent form” (why do they always use that term, “virulent”?) was found in two tales of the Grimm's original compact edition, “The Jew in the Brambles” and “The Good Bargain”. Left out was “The Bright Sun Will Bring It to Light”, a tale Tatar describes as illustrating the compulsion to confess by a young man who murders a Jew. Only “The Jew in the Brambles” appears in Tatar's volume.
In the introduction by A.S. Byatt, we learn that the British occupying forces in Germany after World War II banned Grimm's Fairy Tales because “they fed a supposedly bloodthirsty German imagination.” And indeed, the Grimm brothers (Jacob and Wilhelm) did have nationalistic aims, Byatt says. They believed they were “recovering a German mythology and a German attitude to life. They saw themselves as asserting what was German against the French occupying forces of the Napoleonic Empire.”
One scholar quoted mentions that while French tales were “realistic, earthy, bawdy and comical, the German (tales) veer off toward the supernatural, the poetic, the exotic, and the violent.”
How violent? In the original Cinderella (so named because she slept in the cinders), the wicked stepsisters are forced by the stepmother to actually cut off parts of their feet in order to fit in into the slipper. The blood dripping from the slipper gives them away. This is in contrast to the sanitized version I grew up, where the stepsisters merely tried to force their feet into the slipper.
The tales are loaded with “cruelty, violence, and atrocity, fear of and hatred for the outsider, and virulent anti-Semitism”, said L.L. Snyder, in “Cultural Nationalism: The Grimm Brothers' Fairy Tales.” And yes, we actually hear that the “ashes of Cinderella were a precursor to the ashes of Auschwitz.” (The same point is made in the New York Times review by Neil Gaiman: ”The Jew in the Brambles” casts a long shadow back through the book, leaving one wondering whether the ashes Cinderella slept in would one day become the ashes of Auschwitz.) But keep in mind, Byatt says, that life in those days was already pretty cruel and violent.
An introductory piece says that the National Socialists endorsed Grimm's Fairy Tales as a Haubuch, or “domestic manual for instilling in children a sense of racial pride. For many Nazi commentators, the protagonists of the tales offered models of ‘folkish virtues', for these characters followed their racial instincts and demonstrated courage in the struggle to find a racially pure marriage partner.”
Another scholar cited by Byatt points out that “folktales have certain colors — red, White, black, and the metallic colors of gold and silver and steel.” More National Socialism, I suppose.
So what are racially conscious Whites to make of all this? For one, it's hardly unique for Germanic peoples to have concocted violent tales that instill a fear of outsiders, including Jews. This is perfectly in line with the evolutionary development of any group that survived the ages. Jews, of course, have the Old Testament, where brutality toward outsiders guided by a spiritual command is pretty much the theme of the whole thing. Is there a difference?
Beyond that, I recommend Grimm's Fairy Tales for your children. You can enjoy them on their “traditional” terms, i.e., beloved tales with helpful moral threads, or on a racial-national defense level. Or both. It's yet another way that choosing to live White carries multiple benefits — good for us now, good for us later.
In a biographical sketch of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm contained in the volume, they are portrayed as poverty-stricken but driven collectors of a culture: in addition to the tales, they began work on the German Dictionary and pretty much laid the foundation for the study of Germanic culture. They seemed to have a sense that this culture was under attack, and sought to preserve it the best way they knew how. It's safe to say they had success.
OTTAWA—Warships, aircraft and hundreds of international soldiers are en route to Libya in support of a massive aid mission aimed as much at hastening Col. Moammar Gadhafi's exit from power as relieving the thousands of refugees who are fleeing the country. But as the two-week-old anti-government rebellion shifts increasingly toward a civil war, foreign leaders expressed reluctance Tuesday to come between the armed factions and even showed division over the possibility of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya.

Three American warships are scheduled to enter the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday, U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday, and 400 U.S. Marines are being sent to join them. The ships are intended to give the Americans “the full range of options” in their bid to pressure Gadhafi into stepping down, though the most likely immediate use will be removing foreign nationals from the oil-rich North African country. “We are looking at a lot of options and contingencies,” Gates said. “No decisions have been made on any other actions.”

The no-fly zone seems to have been parked for the moment. Gen. James Mattis, commander of U.S. Central Command, told a Senate hearing that imposing a no-fly zone would be a “challenging” operation that would mean actual attack. “You would have to remove air defence capability in order to establish a no-fly zone, so no illusions here,” Mattis said. “It would be a military operation — it wouldn't be just telling people not to fly airplanes.” Canada, which has three military aircraft in nearby Malta and one in Germany, will dispatch one frigate to the region, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Tuesday. “In light of the trouble and likely ongoing concerns in the region, the HMCS Charlottetown will depart Halifax (Wednesday) to take part in Canadian and international evacuation operations that are already underway in Libya,” he said in the House of Commons.
The frigate's voyage to the region will take about a week. Once there, the ship, 240-sailor crew and Sea King helicopter on board will also be able to enforce sanctions and help deliver aid, said Defence Minister Peter MacKay. “If sanctions deal with certain blockades or certain military, for example, going into the region, we are there for all inevitabilities,” he said.

It is believed that members of Canada's elite special forces are also involved in the rescue missions, some of which involve military airplanes landing without Libyan authorization near remote oilfields. The Canadian Forces never comments on the operations of the commando unit, Joint Task Force Two, but MacKay confirmed the flights so far have been carrying armed soldiers “to ensure that these operations happen smoothly.” A British naval vessel, docking in the opposition-held city of Benghazi, has been shuttling foreigners to safety for several days already. More than a week into the rescue efforts, the Tripoli airport is said to remain chaotic and overcrowded. The Canadian Forces had one of its C-130 Hercules evacuation flights turned back to Malta when the aircraft was denied access to Libyan airspace Tuesday. “The reason for the denial is apparently due to a shortage of ramp space at Tripoli International Airport,” a military spokesperson in Malta said, adding that another flight was scheduled for Wednesday.

We sip beer and philosophize on his front porch, split a pizza, and call it a day. Before I crash on a mattress on the floor in a room that looks like it belongs on the set of “Twin Peaks,'' I note a to-do list on the kitchen table that reads: WASH KEGS, PAINT KEGS, PAINT HOUSE, TEND TO Hop.
Despite his arrival on the Vermont beer scene less than a year ago, Hill is already maxed out, making a batch a day, cranking out about 20,000 gallons of beer a year, sold in kegs to local bars and in growlers from the brewery.
The beer — what I later learn is the Nelson Sauvin IPA — has a cloudy amber color and the nose is a wonderful wallop of green grass, pine, and grapefruit. A sip reveals a strong but not overwhelming hoppy presence with a beautiful, long, bitter finish and a bit of grapefruit tang. This trip is not in vain.
When I arrive, he's in the middle of a phone conversation laden with beer-making jargon — clogged filters and failed beers that taste of green onion — so he shakes my hand, walks into a shed, and returns with a freshly-poured pint for me to ponder while he finishes his call.
I kept tabs on Hill when he returned to his native Greensboro and started his own small brewery. I had a feeling he was up to something good.
I had come to meet Shaun Hill at Hill Farmstead Brewery on a hunch. Hill had worked in Copenhagen for one of my favorite brewers, Anders Kissmeyer (former master brewer at Carlsberg), and the wonderful brewery-restaurant Norrebro Bryghus. Through Kissmeyer, Hill had pointed me in the right direction for an assignment on where to find good beer in Brussels. He gave oddly specific instructions that suggested an impressive knowledge and a funny sense that if he shared his contacts, I had better not bungle the story. He had a reverence for the brewers that suggested he wanted to become part of the canon.
It's strange to think that some of the best craft beer in the United States is coming out of an unfinished garage in upstate Vermont — so remote that the closest well-known town is Stowe, an hour away — but here it is.
As a New Hampshire boy, I remember childhood trips into Vermont's calmer rolling hills and deeper greens, and I like finding the Northeast Kingdom as I remember it.
GREENSBORO BEND — To find the brewing world's whiz kid, I drive the can't-get-there-from-here east-west trek from New Hampshire to Vermont, with dubious cellphone service and dwindling roads that get smaller and narrower like a ball of unraveling string: interstate, state highway, county road, dirt road.
His old gambrel needs some serious TLC. Even the brewhouse — essentially a freestanding oversized garage — is a work in progress, surrounded by dozens of kegs awaiting a refill. “It's kind of a garage,'' he says, “but I call it the brewery.''
Hill is up tending the next morning at five, pouring a giant vat full of water that he'll boil and “condition.'' Making sure the water consistently tastes the way he wants it to be his first step in turning it into beer. Soon, the air is full of hot malt that smells so good, it makes me wish I had eaten more at breakfast.
Once he's moving, talking to Hill or holding his attention gets tricky. At 32, he's still got a bit of college boy in him and an accidental hairdo that reminds me of the spiky-haired guy in the musical group The Prodigy, but there's also a good splash of optimism and a sense of his own potential.
“I started this company as an extension of myself. I feel guilty when I'm not working,'' he says, before a pause. Some things on his list will wait, but not the brewery.
“Every girlfriend I've ever had tells me I'm challenging,'' he adds with a smirk that suggests he might see the truth in what they're saying — not that he's going to change.
Though he uses the occasional exotic ingredient such as Japanese hops in the Sorachi Ace IPA, Hill is after a purity in flavor, the beautiful object derived from a true process.
Watch him work and you understand he's got an intuitive understanding of every aspect of the brewing process. He may talk about a goal of, say, IBUs (international bittering units), or use gauges and thermometers, but he does every step by feel and taste. As he works, he listens to a mix called “For Mom'' with Bon Iver, Ryan Adams, and Jeff Tweedy. There's an automatic ease to his style — the sixth sense of being able to turn a valve or grab a tool without having to look at it, the odd ability to make clearing used malt from a tank look like dancing.
He's also got a surprising bit of flex that occasionally crops up. At one point, mid-process, with eyebrows and eyelashes covered with malt dust, things aren't going exactly as he wants and he just shrugs, says “not much you can do'' to himself, and keeps brewing.
In the meantime, people start trickling in and out from Hill Road. They aren't curious passersby. They are a mix of first-name-basis regulars in for a growler refill, beer geeks, and well-informed foodies on a mission. They crowd around the tiny bar in the corner of the brewery where, Wednesday through Saturday afternoons, visitors can buy a growler, watch Hill work his magic, and try a sample or three.
This day's batch has just received a big dose of hops, delivering what he calls a desirable “dankness.'' The beers he makes end up with near-primary colors, complimentary to Vermont's deep greens and browns. The nose is both pure, with easy to identify aromas, and complex, going from something that's nice to share with friends to something that can trigger an emotional response. Take a sip and you can't help but smile.

Developed by Every Single Soldier and published by Slitherine Games/Matrix Games, Afghanistan '11 is the new version of a unique game formula first utilized in Vietnam '65. In both games, combat is only a means to an end: winning the hearts and minds of a nation. In Afghanistan '11 (A11) the player must deal with multiple new layers of strategy in order to achieve that goal.
Dealing with an insurgency is one of the most frustrating problems for modern military forces. Fighting a enemy that appears from among the civilian population, and then fades away again, makes conventional tactics far less effective. All the tanks and fighter jets in the world won't help you defeat an ideology, if the local people support it. This leads us to the key to victory in A11, winning over the local population to your cause.
Players in A11 will certainly spend a lot of time sending troops into battle, ordering airstrikes, and deploying special forces via helicopters. However, most of these actions will be done in support of more strategic objectives like clearing IED's from highways, connecting isolated villages with roads, and sending supplies to those villages to earn their cooperation. To keep operations running smoothly, the player will also need to consider logistics. Every unit in the field only has enough rations/fuel to operate for around four or five turns before it needs return to base or be resupplied. Supplies can be delivered by truck, helicopter, or emergency drops. To really be effective, the player will need to build Forward Operating Bases (FOB's) in order to project their power further out from HQ.
There is another important factor the player must consider at all times: Political Points (PP). Every new unit brought into the theater, every casualty sustained, and even every movement a unit makes will cost you PP. Defeating enemy forces and clearing away opium fields, among other actions, will bump this number up. The player is also able to influence the occasional election of a new president of Afghanistan using these points. A more friendly government will make your life easier, while a pro-Taliban leader will make life miserable.
As you can see, A11 mimics the troubles of the real conflict on several levels. Simply running around fighting the militia and Taliban groups active on the map will get you nowhere. These enemy forces have no base that you can destroy, and will never stop coming at you. Instead, the player must keep those foes at bay with one hand, while building up infrastructure and civilian relationships with the other.
A11 is a turn based game in which each of your units has a specific number of action points they can use to move, fight or perform other actions each turn. There are about a dozen different unit types, each with an important role to play in your strategy. Infantry units can go into villages to collect intel, sweep an area around themselves for IED's, and of course fight the enemy head on. Husky mine sweeping vehicles are crucial for keeping roads and highways clear of IED's so that you can move convoys of supplies and troops around the map quickly. Don't leave home without one, seriously! Transport trucks are a cheap way to resupply FOB's and take UN aid to villages, while the far more expensive Chinook helicopter does the same job with the advantage of zipping around through the air. There are also Blackhawk helicopters, MRAP transports, special forces squads, artillery, and engineers to build things. If you have the PP available, you can call in Stryker APC's and Apache gunships to add some serious firepower to the battle.
The game has an effective series of tutorial missions which teach you about all the different units and how to use them. The tutorial covers the basic strategic concepts needed for victory, but it will still very much be a trial by fire when you take on your first real mission. This is because the gameplay is open ended and lets you as the commander approach a mission in whatever way you see fit. Will you build up a network of FOB's and roads to create a permanent presence all over the map, or will you bring in numerous helicopters to move everything by air. Likely you will need a mixture depending on the the local terrain and distribution of villages.
There are two different ways to play the game, either the 18 mission campaign based on real world events, or the randomized skirmish mode. The scenarios take the core gameplay and add a few twists, but the skirmish mode alone will keep any player busy.
Let's take a spin through what a typical skirmish match entails. You will begin the game with an HQ and nothing else. Looking out across the randomly generated map you will see a highway, some roads, mountains, deserts, maybe a river, and the key feature that the game revolves around: villages. Each village has a flag indicating its current political leaning. Keep the villages leaning towards the government or coalition and you will have smooth sailing. Let a village slip into the grasp of the local militia, or even the Taliban, and that area of the map becomes more dangerous.
Not a good neighborhood.
There are several actions you can take to get those villages on your side. Using your engineer units to connect those villages to the main highway and build a water supply is the most permanent way to accomplish this. However, it requires a significant investment of PP and time. Additionally, that new infrastructure then becomes a target for your enemy and forces you stretch your forces even further. You can also win hearts and minds by delivering UN aid to the villages using either supply trucks or Chinooks. This is an especially good way to influence the more remote villages that you may not be able to reach otherwise. Clearing IED's and destroying enemy units will also boost support in your favor.
The sum of your efforts will be shown in the hearts and minds score, always visible at the top of the screen. Your goal in a skirmish is to get this number past a certain threshold and keep it there until the final turn. Keeping it high will help with the presidential elections which occur a few times during a typical match. Getting a more favorable candidate in office will often make your actions cheaper and enemy actions less frequent. Let that score lapse and your PP will start slipping away. If your political position back home gets too abysmal the game will end prematurely.
Now, while you are working to win the people over to your side, what is the enemy doing? Enemy forces come in two flavors, numerous yet weak militia and the more resilient Taliban. The militia forces will pop up all over the map, and then attempt to place IED's and cause other trouble for you. One hit from any of your combat units will either destroy them or send them scattering in every direction. Taliban units will initially only appear along the eastern edge of the map, representing Pakistan, and then move in to try and influence villages and cause other problems. These Taliban groups take two hits to destroy. Hit them only once and they will flee momentarily, only to regroup and continue with their mission. If a village falls completely into the grasp of the Taliban, they will then begin spawning nearby.
Combat in A11 is simple on the surface. Select a combat unit and mouse over an enemy to see your percentage chance of winning. Click to carry out the attack and hope for the best. The strategy comes in deciding which units to use for combat and when. It is always favorable to destroy the enemy by using artillery, airstrikes, or gunships, because sending in ground forces carries the risk that they will take casualties or even be destroyed. Losing a unit this way is a real one-two punch, since you lose political points immediately and must spend more to replace that unit. FOB's come with a free mortar unit for defense, but it has limited ammunition. More ammo must be brought in from HQ to keep the shells flying. Heavy artillery guns can also be brought in to an upgraded FOB if you need serious defense.
Funding cuts can make a difficult situation even worse.
This is a good time to discuss upgrading FOB's. When a FOB is initially placed, it serves as a safe harbor in the field for your units. Units resting there will be slowly resupplied, but cannot replace their losses. You can choose to add on to a FOB with a field hospital, vehicle repair yard, and/or heavy artillery pit. These upgrades are expensive, so you must decide which FOB's are worth upgrading, and to what extent. A fully upgraded and supplied FOB can allow you to maintain a powerful force far away from your HQ. The logistics of keeping that FOB manned and supplied is something you will need to plan ahead of time.
Another item you must consider as part of your long term strategy is the training of the Afghanistan National Army (ANA). On specific turns you will be expected to have achieved a certain ratio of ANA to coalition combat units in theater. Towards the end of a match you will be forced to hand complete control over to the ANA, so you need to have stabilized the area by that point if you don't want to watch all of your hard work be wiped away. Training the ANA is one of the jobs of your extremely useful special forces units. While stationed at your HQ, these units can train ANA artillery, APC, and helicopter units. Move them out to a FOB and they can begin training ANA infantry. The ANA troops are not as good in combat as the American forces, but are better for visiting villages.
An ideal result!
Did I mention the part about visiting villages yet? Like I said at the beginning, this game has a lot of strategic layers happening all at once, which made it difficult to find a logical flow for this review! Anyway, each village has a campfire in it that will begin to burn whenever new intelligence is potentially available. You will need to send in an infantry unit to visit with the village elders and see what they can learn. Sometimes your men will come up empty, but other times the location of an IED, opium field, or enemy unit will be revealed on the map. An exposed enemy unit makes easy prey for an airstrike. Getting eyes on the enemy is always the trickiest part of combat in this game, so revealing units in this way is very helpful. The availability of intel in a village will refresh over time, so you will want to be constantly sending out patrols to keep the information flowing. This means that your units can't just sit around in their FOB's, they must be constantly moving around the map. Again, this is where logistical planning early on can pay dividends later.
That is a lot of IED's. Remember, always bring your minesweeper on any ground expeditions.
That point, long term planning and logistics, is really what makes this game compelling in my eyes. It's not a game where clever tactical maneuvering of your forces matters much, and it's not a game where putting the biggest weapons in the field will bring you victory. This is a game where thoughtful planning of a strategy requires thinking through how you will keep that strategy in motion. Ultimately, supply trucks and engineers are more critical to your mission than Apache gunships. Of course, that Apache might need to be on hand to save those supply trucks from a surprise ambush!
President-elect Donald Trump has been busy since Election Day carefully choosing members who will fill his cabinet. But in the midst of the rush to staff his administration, Trump took time for advice from Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. The judge outlined desirable qualities for a potential nominee who could fill an empty Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia who died in February.

The judge advised the president-elect on how to scope out the best candidates based on intellectual, ideological, and temperamental qualities.
“He was interested in a broad range of ideas and attitudes about the type of person who would best fill Justice Scalia's seat,” Napolitano told the FOX Business Network's Stuart Varney.
Though Napolitano's focus was on advice concerning the next Supreme Court appointment, he said his conversation with Trump also included discussion about the Dow Jones Industrial Average nearing the 20000 milestone.
Image Credit: Dark Horse; Inset: Michael Buckner/Getty ImagesThe acclaimed (oc)cult TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer went off the air in 2003 after seven seasons. But for nearly four years, Buffy's story has lived on in creator Joss Whedon's “Season 8” comic book series, which finishes its 40-issue run today. Whoa, boy, did things go down. (WARNING: Some big time spoilers follow, for both “Season 8” and the impending “Season 9.” Consider yourself warned now.) Over the course of the “season,” Buffy became a god, battled (and boinked) her ex Angel, and watched him kill her mentor Giles. And then she effectively destroyed the seed of all magic on earth. Issue No. 40 deals with the aftermath, and — as Whedon makes clear in his exclusive Q&A with EW — it also gives some pointed hints for what to expect in Buffy “Season 9.” Whedon also talks about his new comic series about Angel with publisher Dark Horse, some of his controversial plot turns in “Season 8” — Buffy goes lesbian? Xander and Dawn get domestic? — and what actor Anthony Stewart Head's reaction was when Whedon told him his character Rupert Giles was going to bite the big one.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So no more magic, huh?
JOSS WHEDON: [Chuckles] Well, let's not use hyperbole. No more magic in the sense of not so much entirely convenient magic. I wanted to play with the idea of the world dimming a little bit. Possibly because that's how I feel about it, or at least this country in the last 10 years. And I wanted to do a little bit of a reset, where things seem more back down to earth. I got very excited when I had a comic book with the idea that I could do absolutely anything. We hit a lot of beautiful notes and I've got a lot of great writers working [on the comics], and I'm very proud of it. But at the same time, it's like, yeah, “You can do anything” is not really the Buffy mission statement. The Buffy mission statement is, “What does this feel like?” So I wanted to bounce it back a little bit to the real world.
Issue No. 40 is clearly setting up Season 9, and makes it seem like it is going to be far more human-scaled.
It will be more like the television show. With the comic, we just sort of said, “Wheee!” Ultimately, “Wheee!” caught up with us in a cavalcade of mythology. It became clear, as it did with the show, that people really liked when Buffy's adventures reflect what she's going through in her life [and] what we're going through in our lives at that age. That was the thing in season 8 that we didn't tap into as much as I think we ultimately should have.
You did seem to touch on that idea when you, essentially, made Buffy a god with her own idyllic world, and she pretty much rejected it right off the bat.
Yeah. I feel like we're true to the characters. It was just that very basic mission statement of, “You know what, I'm going through this, too.” Not a lot of people are leading armies. Buffy, part of her charm is that the fact that, outside the mystical world, she was nobody. And it was interesting to put her in that power position and to play on that grand scale. But ultimately, I think the fans more enjoy her when she is the little underdog and not the little overlord.
Not that anybody who's a Buffy fan should be that shocked that you did this at this point, but Joss, you killed Giles.
Yeah, I did. I did. I have several reasons for that, some of which I can't reveal because ripples from that event are going to be a part of both [the Buffy “Season 9” comic and the new Angel comic]. Part of it was really just feeling that Giles' place in the comic book did not sit the way it did in the show. To have this paternal, expositional guy there — it wasn't really something that played in the comics the way it did when Tony Head [i.e. actor Anthony Stewart Head] does it. I wanted to make all this matter and have something that would send emotional ripples through all the characters. Also, I'm a prick. But I did tell Tony it was going to happen before it did. At first he said, “Oooh,” a little worried. Then I said, “Angel's gonna kill you.” He said, all excited, “Oooh! That's great!” [Laughs]
Perhaps the other most controversial choice you made was to enter Buffy into a lesbian relationship. For some fans, that did seem to come oddly out of left field.
You know, I didn't hear any real objection to that. But I don't go trolling on websites for people that don't like me. I'm very fragile, like an egg. We had talked about the idea of Buffy having a lesbian fling as one of the things that does actually reflect where she is in her life, if you consider the events in “Season 8” to be her college experience. It's that time in your life where that might happen. We just slammed right into it with a splash page, instead of tenuously inching towards it. And that was largely [writer] Drew Goddard's call. He said, “You know what? It would be obvious to start building toward this, and then seeing that play out, how that would be. I think in a lot of these situations, it just kind of happens, and then you deal with it.” It's more interesting and it gives us a better opportunity to face the reality of a situation like that.
You also had Xander and Dawn ultimately become a romantic item, and you outed vampires to the world. It seems like you wanted to advance the story in a really meaningful, significant way on a lot of fronts.
You can't just sit around and spin your wheel with these guys. The show lasted on the idea that people are constantly changing. What makes them interesting? So, is Willow destined to go dark? How is that future going to unfold? Who is in love with whom? Who can't be with whom? That's part of what makes their interaction rich. It's not just, “We're clever and funny, the murder is solved.” It's just not the way I write. It was still very clear to me that Xander and Dawn were going to end up together by the very start [of Season 8]. And actually, I was surprised that anybody was surprised. All their interactions were so tight, and occasionally weirdly physical. It was all pointing there. He tried to have a relationship with somebody else, but some prick killed her.
You mentioned earlier about getting into a bit of trouble thanks to the freedom that comic books afforded you. But what was your favorite “We could never do this on the TV show” moment?
I gotta go with giant Dawn. I loved giant Dawn so much, absolutely more than the readers, but I didn't care. The idea that Dawn becomes a giant and all the permutations of that, some of which we didn't even get to do, that was such a delight for me. It just absolutely fit in the universe. It was the right kind of problem for Dawn to have.
On the penultimate page of issue No. 40, there's a guy in John Lennon glasses who look fairly evil. Am I right in thinking he's new? Or am I just not remembering him from season 8?
He's a new guy. I can't tell you about him. But you are not wrong to say you don't remember him, because he has not appeared yet. He has yet to come.
In the Fray storyline from “Season 8” — in which Buffy got sucked into the world of your spin-off comic about a slayer living far into the future — we met Dark Willow again, and we seem to be heading in that direction the way we left Willow at the end of “Season 8.”
Well, maybe. It's a question we're holding out there right now: Is that her destiny? Can she get her powers back? This idea of magic being taken out of the world — that's going to be her personal obsession and will result in a miniseries. She can have center stage for a while. Whether or not that means that'll send her to become the evil Fray'd version of herself is something we're going to dangle.
Finally, all due respect to the amazing artists who drew the comic and did the covers, but do you ever miss having the actors to bring these stories to life?
I do. Particularly, as I said before, in the case of Giles. Tony has this cool sexuality that just doesn't come on the page when he's saying, [in a British accent] “Oh, this book says blah blah blah.” It's hard to capture some of the stuff that the actors bring. Tony is astonishing. I can't speak highly enough of how artist Georges Jeanty captured their likenesses, but still made it look like a comic book and not like balloon heads on hastily drawn panels. And the way he captured Buffy was really lovely. But yeah, you hear [the characters] so well, sometimes it's like they're there. It is frustrating at times. You're like, “Why can't they just be there? Let's get the whole gang back together again.”

Hillary Clinton fell a shocking 63 spots to 65 on the Forbes list of the world's most powerful women just a year after her US presidential election loss to Donald Trump.
Newcomer to the list UK Prime Minister Theresa May took Clinton's spot at No 2 on the list, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel remained at No 1 on the Forbes list for another year.
Clinton's election loss in 2016 left the United States one of the world's few leading democracies to yet see a female leader.
Hillary Clinton fell a shocking 63 spots to 65 on the Forbes list of the world's most powerful women after her 2016 presidential loss to Donald Trump
The former First Lady and former Secretary of State may sit 65 on the world's most powerful women list, but on a list of solely women in politics, Clinton is No 20.
Clinton has moved to the sidelines of politics since her election loss and is now building her organization, Onward Together, which works to recruit future political candidates.
Meanwhile, Merkel and May sit atop both the overall and politics-focused lists of the world's most powerful women.
Merkel, who has been in office since 2005, won a fiercely contested election this year in which she held off the growing far-right influence of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
May, the conservative Prime Minister of the UK, moved into her role after Britons voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, prompting then-Prime Minister David Cameron to resign.

There was some awful news from Afghanistan last week, overlooked in the midst of Egypt's tectonic eruption. Kabul Bank is near collapse. Apparently the owners  who include President Hamid Karzai's brother Mahmood and other assorted political cronies  had, among other nefarious activities, taken the bank's assets and speculated in Dubai real estate, which promptly crashed. The Afghan government does most of its business through Kabul Bank; if the bank fails, the government won't be able to pay its workers, including the army. Millions in international aid may be washed away.
And so, a familiar dilemma: Bail out the bank or let it collapse? My first thought was that the situation might provide the NATO coalition with some leverage: we could offer to bail out the bank, but only if Karzai stepped aside and allowed an esteemed technocrat  like Ashraf Ghani, who ran for President against Karzai and was crushed  to run the show in the interim. But this was no leverage at all, as I learned in conversations with several Afghan sources. Karzai would just as soon allow the bank to collapse. "Then he could say [to the Americans]," a Western diplomat told me, "You figure out a way to pay the army." (See why Hamid Karzai was a runner-up for TIME 2010 Person of the Year.)
How on earth do we get saddled with such creepy clients as Karzai and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, over and over again? In large part, it's a vestige of the Cold War, when all the world was a potential theater in the struggle against communism. Afghanistan was certainly one; the Soviet departure created a vacuum, and the Taliban rushed in. The Kissingerian effort to transfer Egypt from the Soviet account to the American side in the 1970s, later perfected by Jimmy Carter, was certainly another.
Our adventures in the world have been accompanied by a never-ending tug-of-war between U.S. foreign policy realists and idealists. Through much of the 20th century, the idealists tended to be liberals in the spirit of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted World War I to make the world "safe for democracy." Since Vietnam, however, liberals have been more pessimistic. They winced when Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union an "evil empire," fearing a nuclear confrontation. They were infuriated by the naiveté and hubris of George W. Bush's "Freedom Agenda," which was promoted as a rationale for the invasion of Iraq after that country's weapons of mass destruction turned out to be a mirage. They are increasingly skeptical about the war in Afghanistan and appalled by the prospect of a pre-emptive war with Iran. (See David Miliband's take on the way out of Afghanistan.)
Nowadays, the foreign policy idealists tend to be neoconservatives  and as Egypt erupted, they were crowing. "Dictatorships are never truly stable," Elliott Abrams, the former Reagan and Bush national-security expert, wrote in the Washington Post. "Regimes that make moderate politics impossible make extremism far more likely." These were noble sentiments, celebrating Bush the Younger's agenda. Others cited Condoleezza Rice's 2005 Cairo speech, in which she publicly chided Mubarak and called for democratic reform. But Rice's speech was just rhetoric; in reality, Bush embraced Mubarak as fiercely as his predecessors, fearing that an Egyptian epiphany would produce an Islamist government. Indeed, the tangible fruits of the Freedom Agenda turned out to be mostly rotten: elections in the Palestinian territories, which no one but Hamas (and Bush) wanted, produced a Hamas plurality; a push for democracy in Afghanistan produced a foolish constitution, centralizing power in a notoriously decentralized country, and corrupt elections. And the jury is still out on Iraq, where the most vital "democratic" force may turn out to be the populist, Iran-leaning cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.
The truth is, both strict realism and idealism have failed us overseas. Too often, realism is just a rationale for maintaining the autocratic status quo, which never lasts, especially when presided over by terminal narcissists like Mubarak and Karzai. Too often, idealism assumes democracy can be plopped into a culture without a middle class or a history of free institutions. (Read about Turkey's advice to Egypt on political change.)
A smarter foreign policy would quietly promote a careful transition from autocracy to something more benign. The best way to do this is to latch onto institutions, not individual leaders, in the developing countries we seek as allies. Sadly, the most reliable institution to latch onto  to train, equip and support  is often the army. Humanitarian aid is nice, but difficult to dispense and too often corrupted. Military aid comes with strings that bind  the continuing need for spare parts, for example. But strong armies create security, a necessary precursor for democracy.
It is not a sure thing, of course; armies have provided a steady global diet of horrific dictators. In some cases, like Pakistan, military assistance helps create greater regional tension. But when we're lucky abroad, as in Turkey, the military midwifes the transition to democracy. That will be true in Egypt as well  and perhaps even in Afghanistan  if we're lucky.

BCCI president Anurag Thakur has said his board will oppose the proposed two-tier Test system to "protect the interests" of smaller member nations. As the head of the powerful BCCI, Thakur's statement lends heft to the criticism of the proposal by Sri Lanka Cricket and the Bangladesh Cricket Board, even as the boards of Australian and New Zealand have welcomed the move.
"The BCCI is against the two-tier Test system because the smaller countries will lose out and the BCCI wants to take care of them," Thakur told the New Indian Express. "It is necessary to protect their interests."
The proposal to split Test cricket into two tiers - with seven nations in tier one, and five, including two new Test nations, in the second tier - was mooted at the ICC's annual conference, in Edinburgh, where ICC chief executive David Richardson advocated a "proper competition structure", with promotion and relegation, for Test cricket to have greater context. "Unless we can give some meaning to these series beyond the rankings and a trophy, then interest in Test cricket will continue to waver," Richardson said. "The same applies if we allow uncompetitive Test cricket to take place too often."
While SLC voiced skepticism about the financial model of the two-tier system, the BCB felt Bangladesh's growth would be affected should they be divorced from the top teams. "We believe that more we play against competitive sides, the better we will get," BCB vice-president Mahbubul Anam said. "If we didn't play against better-standard sides in ODIs, we wouldn't have come this far. We were given a reality check when we were promoted to the highest level. I feel that if we go backwards, our cricket will regress."
Thakur's comments seemed to address both concerns as he spelt out the drawbacks of the two-tier system. "In the two-tier system, they will lose out on a lot, including revenue and the opportunity to play against top teams," he said. "We don't want that to happen. We want to work in the best interests of world cricket and that is why our team plays against all the countries".
In Galle, meanwhile, Cricket Australia chairman David Peever urged nations to embrace change and balance notions of tradition with progress.
The Government is set to throw out the 165-year old law that obliges the Bank to publish a weekly account of its balance sheet – a move that will allow it theoretically to embark covertly on so-called quantitative easing. The Banking Bill, which is currently passing through Parliament, abolishes a key section of the law laid down by Robert Peel's Government in 1844 which originally granted the Bank the sole right to print UK money.
The ostensible reason for the reform, which means the Bank will not have to print details of its own accounts and the amount of notes and coins flowing through the UK economy, is to allow the Bank more power to overhaul troubled financial institutions in the future, under its Special Resolution Authority.
However, some have warned that it means: "there is nothing to stop an unreported and unmonitored flooding of the money market by the undisciplined use of the printing presses."
It comes after the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee cut interest rates by half a percentage point, leaving them at the lowest level since the bank's foundation in 1694.
With the Bank rate now at 1.5pc, most economists suspect the Government and Bank will soon be forced to start quantitative easing – directly increasing the quantity of money in the economy – in a drastic attempt to prevent a recession of unprecedented depth.
Although the amount of easing is likely to be limited, news of this increased secrecy will spark comparisons with Weimar Germany and Zimbabwe, where uncontrolled use of the central banks' printing presses ultimately caused hyperinflation.
The Bank said it will still publish details of its balance sheet, but, significantly, the data – the main indicator of the extent of quantitative easing – will not be presented until more than a month has elapsed. For instance, under the new terms of the law, if the Bank were to have embarked on a policy of quantitative easing last month, the figures on this would not be published until the end of this month.
The reforms, which are likely to be implemented later this year, will make the Bank of England by far the most secretive major central in the world, experts said.
In the US, where the Federal Reserve has already cut rates to close to zero and started quantitative easing, the main way to track its purchases of securities and the expansion of its balance sheet is through precisely these same weekly accounts.
"Quite why the Bank has to keep its operations so shrouded in secrecy is a mystery to me," said Simon Ward, economist at New Star. "This [reform] will make it much more difficult to track what the Bank is doing."
Among the details which will no longer be published are those revealing the extent to which London's banks are using the Bank's deposit facilities – a yardstick of pressure in the financial system.
Debating the issue in the House of Lords recently, Lord James of Blackheath, a Conservative peer, said: "Remove [this] control and there is nothing to stop an unreported and unmonitored flooding of the money market by the undisciplined use of the printing presses.
"If we went down that path we would be following a road which starts in Weimar, goes on through Harare and must not end in Westminster and London. That is the great fear that the abolition of that section will bring about – but the Bill abolishes it."

The ever-quotable Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's deputy prime minister, did not take kindly to being banned from Romania's airspace earlier today. On his way back from visiting the pro-Russian breakaway region Transdniestria in Moldova, Rogozin's plane was reportedly turned away as it headed toward Moscow.
The head of the Military-Industrial Commission and special envoy of President Putin, Rogozin is currently being sanctioned by the United States and the European Union. After being barred, he threatened to return to Romania. On a bomber plane. Here was the tweet:
Upon US request, Romania has closed its airspace for my plane. Ukraine doesn't allow me to pass through again. Next time I'll fly on board TU-160."
As Reuters pointed out "the supersonic Soviet-era TU-160 is Russia's largest strategic bomber."
Rogozin, who also holds a PhD., made some headlines earlier this month with his classic reaction to the latest round of American sanctions against Russia. Again, taking to Twitter, he offered:
"After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest that the USA bring their astronauts to the International Space Station using a trampoline."
The Romanian foreign ministry has asked for a clarification to Rogozin's comments about the fighter plane, noting that it "believes the threat of using a Russian strategic bomber plane by a Russian deputy prime minister is a very grave statement under the current regional context."
Rogozin responded :
Well, Sirs from Romania, we'll soon explain it all to you - who you are and what we think of you — Dmitry Rogozin (@DRogozin) May 10, 2014

When Saudi Arabia pushed for an arms deal with Germany in December 2012, the opposition of Social Democrats and Greens was outraged, while chancellor Angela Merkel from the Christian Democrats remained silent. Then, it was about NBC armored reconnaissance tanks, battle tanks and armored transport vehicles. Now, with Saudi Arabia wanting to purchase patrol ships for 1.5 billion euros (2.01 billion Dollar), reactions are mostly the same. Opposition and experts worry about the implications such deals have for the questionable human rights policies in countries like Saudi Arabia.
Stability vs. Human Rights in the Middle East
Out of concern for human rights violations, demosntrators in Berlin protested against weapons exports to Saudi Arabia
According to the German "Rüstungsexportbericht" (Arms export report) 2011, Saudi Arabia placed 12th among the largest importers of German arms. They received military equipment worth 1.3 billion euros. But they are not the only country in the region to be supplied with weapons from Germany. Other recipients include United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Jordan, Algeria and Israel.
The Middle East is one of the most highly militarized regions in the world, according to the Global Militarization Index (GMI). "You have to be very careful about who you're selling weapons to in the Middle East," warns armament expert Christian Mölling of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) in an interview with DW.
The German government believes Saudi Arabia to be important for stability in the region, but admits that there are differences of opinion when it comes to human rights. Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle stresses that the topic frequently comes up in discussions with Riyadh, but that's not convincing for some experts. In 2011 for example, Saudi Arabia sent tanks and troops to Bahrain to help the reigning monarchy strike down the people's protests during the Arab Spring.
"Our government seems to be ok with exporting to countries where the state of human rights is questionable or even miserable," Jan Grebe, researcher at the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC), says. He adds that the German government hasn't fully explained yet why it is willing to put aside the issue of human rights when it comes to a good export deal.
Israeli Armament

Even though Saudi Arabia mostly managed to evade the Arab Spring, the country wants to be able to smother any potential protests. There are also speculations that the Saudis want to arm themselves against Iran, their arch-enemy. "Many countries in the Middle East perceive Iran to be a danger, but that doesn't mean that the German government should support the neighboring nations' armament," says Grebe. He believes that disarmament and trust-building measures in the region would be better ways of action for Berlin.
Iran pushes forward with its nuclear program, which could lead to military action from Israel, as the country sees its very existence threatened by Iran. Israel is close to chancellor Merkel's heart, and she has declared the Jewish state's security a matter of high importance to Germany. When Egypt under President Mohamed Mursi ordered submarines from Germany last year, Berlin promised Israel that delivery would be halted if Egypt showed any signs of "animosity" toward Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Israel itself receives submarines from Germany that can be upgraded to nuclear weapons. "That's a contribution to Israeli stability," Christian Mölling from the SWP says. "This way, Israel is ready to defend itself."
Keeping German Arms Producers Strong
It is, however, highly questionable whether an arms race in the Middle East really leads to more stability for the region. BICC researcher Grebe has his doubts: "Military goods are durable goods, and nobody knows today how political constellations will change tomorrow, or into whose hands the weapons might fall."
Jürgen Trittin from the Green Party demands a restrictive arms exports law
That is why the German opposition demands a new law to restrict arms deals. The head of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, insists on a law that prohibits military exports to countries that "endanger German security and the security and human rights of their people." But a deal like this would not go over well with the arms industry, which has been pushing exports to the Middle East and other so-called third-party countries. The push seems to be a long-term trend, which has its roots in the shrinking demand from smaller armies in European countries and the European financial crisis.
Mölling has another reason: "The German arms exports serve mainly as a means to insure that Germany itself can keep buying high-grade military goods from local producers." The more money German arms producers make with their exports, the more goods they can produce. And Berlin is very keen on the continued production of high-end military technology in Germany.
While singer Taylor Swift is said to be furious and planning her payback
Singer Ray J - who features in the video - said it was 'not cool'
West claimed it was merely a comment on fame and not an attack
Lena Dunham called West out, said it was 'disturbing' and like a 'snuff film'
Lena Dunham has slammed Kanye West's new music video as an attack on women and 'one of the most disturbing 'artistic' efforts in recent memory'.
The Girls star said the Famous video - which features synthetic versions of West and wife Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift, Donald Trump and more naked in bed together - made her feel 'sad and unsafe and worried for the teenage girls'.
In a lengthy Facebook post sent Monday, Dunham joined the choir of haters who have lined up to critique West's latest offering.
'One of the more disturbing 'artistic' efforts in recent memory,': Lena Dunham, pictured on Monday in New York, has written a lengthy blog post slamming Kanye West's new video for Famous
Losing friends: Lena's review of the video follows her pal Swift who was said to be 'mad as hell' at the rapper for using a naked lookalike wax figure of her in his Famous music video
Famous people: Kanye has kept mum on who was real and who was fake in this orgy scene from his Famous music video that includes visages of, L to R, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Taylor, Kanye, Kim, Ray J and Amber Rose
She prefaced her post by saying she admired the whole West/ Kardashian family and loved the way they depict women as better in numbers and masters of their own destiny' - but that this didn't stop her from disliking the video.
Dunham said that as well it falling short artistically, the 'disturbing' video came at time of a deep unease for women across the world.
Citing the controversial Brock Turner sentencing, the prevalence of assaults filmed on Periscope, girls committing suicide for being exposed and the unraveling Bill Crosby trial, Dunham argued that the video only added to the negative noise.
'Now I have to see the prone, unconscious, waxy bodies of famous women, twisted like they've been drugged and chucked aside at a rager?,' she wrote.
Dunham added that she didn't care if she wasn't having a 'hip cool reaction' because seeing women - in particular her good friend Taylor Swift or those she admired like Rihanna or Anna Wintour - reduced to a 'pair of waxy breasts made by some special effects guy in the Valley' was the 'stuff of snuff films'.
She acknowledged that West was 'cool' but pleaded with him to make a statement on the Illuminati without propping up aspects of popular culture that 'make women feel unsafe even in their own beds, in their own bodies'.
Listen: The rapper debuted his song Famous for the first time at his Yeezy 3 fashion show on February 11 and everyone heard the lyrics 'I feel like me and Taylor might have sex/ Why? I made that b***h famous'
'A woman I admire reduced to a pair of waxy breasts made by some special effects guy up in the Valley' Lena didn't hold back as she described her disgust at Kanye's creation
Along with her lengthy post she attached a photo of a cake with the German phrase 'Alles Liebe' (All the best) written in icing.
'Y'all, I'm so sick of showing up to the party angry. But at least I brought cake.' she joked.
But Speaking to Vanity Fair, West claimed that the video was not in support or against anyone, but merely a comment on fame.
He even went as far as to say that famous friends who didn't feature 'wished they were in the bed'.
It is clear though, that he was waiting for the condemnation to start building and even went as far as to tweet on Saturday: 'Can somebody sue me already #I'll wait.'
No-one is yet to take him up on his offer but Swift is said to be 'strategizing with her team as to what her next move should be.'
A source told HollywoodLife.com: 'Taylor is furious after seeing Kanye's video. She feels like she's been assaulted.'
LENA DUNHAM'S CRITIQUE OF 'FAMOUS' VIDEO IN FULL Peeking From Between My Fingers: some disjointed thoughts on the 'Famous' video Like many pop culture addicted Americans, I wait with bated breath for what Kanye West will do next. Aside from his Twitter mayhem, he has created some really 'next level shit' as the kids would say. I could also happily watch Kim Kardashian West chip the paint off a window ledge for hours and be fascinated. I admire that whole family, love the way they depict women as better in numbers and masters of their own destiny. I'd spend all summer at Kamp Kardashian. But it's possible to hold two competing thoughts in your mind and the Famous video is one of the more disturbing 'artistic' efforts in recent memory. Let's break it down: at the same time Brock Turner is getting off with a light tap for raping an unconscious woman and photographing her breasts for a group chat... As assaults are Periscoped across the web and girls commit suicide after being exposed in ways they never imagined... While Bill Cosby's crimes are still being uncovered and understood as traumas for the women he assaulted but also massive bruises to our national consciousness... Now I have to see the prone, unconscious, waxy bodies of famous women, twisted like they've been drugged and chucked aside at a rager? It gives me such a sickening sense of dis-ease. I was raised in the art world by a dad who painted aggro scenes of sexuality and war and a mom who, ironically enough, has photographed some butt naked life-sized dolls of her own. I live for the nude rabble rousing of Carolee Schneemann and Hannah Wilke, for Kathy Acker's arty porn, for Paul McCarthy's gnomes with butt plugs and Vito Acconci masturbating under the gallery floor and Carrie Mae Weems shedding a blinding light on the pleasures and terrors of black womanhood. If it's been banned, I'll probably love it. Because I know that art's job is to make us think in ways that aren't always tidy or comfortable. But this feels different. I'm sure that Bill Cosby doll being in the bed alongside Donald Trump is some kind of statement, that I'm probably being trolled on a super high level. I know that there's a hipper or cooler reaction to have than the one I'm currently having. But guess what? I don't have a hip cool reaction, because seeing a woman I love like Taylor Swift (fuck that one hurt to look at, I couldn't look), a woman I admire like Rihanna or Anna, reduced to a pair of waxy breasts made by some special effects guy in the Valley, it makes me feel sad and unsafe and worried for the teenage girls who watch this and may not understand that grainy roving camera as the stuff of snuff films. I hesitated a lot about saying anything cuz I figured the thinkpieces would come pouring in. But I didn't see this angle being explored as much as I had hoped. It's weird to feel like you're watching alone. I bet I'm not. Here's the thing, Kanye: you're cool. Make a statement on fame and privacy and the Illuminati or whatever is on your mind! But I can't watch it, don't want to watch it, if it feels informed and inspired by the aspects of our culture that make women feel unsafe even in their own beds, in their own bodies. Y'all, I'm so sick of showing up to the party angry. But at least I brought cake.
Taylor and Kanye's turbulent history goes back to the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when he burst on stage during her award acceptance speech and took the microphone away
Kanye was perhaps referencing that incident when he wrote a line about 'Taylor' in his song Famous.
'I feel like me and Taylor might have sex/ Why? I made that b***h famous,' Kanye rapped.
At the time, Taylor didn't approve of the lyrics' 'strong misogynistic message' and told Kanye as much, while Kanye claimed he 'did not diss Taylor Swift' and had her okay, according to Entertainment Weekly.
Controversial star: Kanye remained straight-faced as he arrived at his Calabasas office on Monday
Meanwhile singer Ray J - who also features in the video next to a sleeping Kim - has slammed the offereing for being 'not cool.'
He told Entertainment Tonight that his fiancee, Princess Love, is especially upset about the video: 'I'm engaged. My marriage is all messed up 'cause of craziness. I'm not part of nothing crazy.
'I walk down a good path. My fiancée tripping. It's all bad in my world, and that ain't cool.'
Kim Kardashian famously dated Ray long before she married West and the pair made a sex tape that leaked in 2007.
Kanye debuted the tune at his Yeezy 3 show during New York Fashion Week on February 11.
Swift plot: The 26-year-old pop star is apparently 'planning something' and 'trying to figure out how to respond' to Kanye's shocking move, according to the news site
PISCATAWAY -- Rutgers is finalizing a deal with Ohio State defensive coordinator Chris Ash to be its new head coach, according to a top school official. The hiring must be approved by the university's Board of Governors on Monday before it becomes official. News of Ash's impending hiring was first reported by Sports Illustrated.
Ash, 41, has been the defensive coordinator at Ohio State for the past two seasons. The Buckeyes are ranked second nationally in scoring defense this season.
Rutgers athletic director Pat Hobbs declined to comment when approached at halftime of Saturday's men's basketball game against Seton Hall.
Rutgers fired Kyle Flood on Sunday after four years as head coach.
Ash was a top candidate for the Syracuse coaching vacancy, but reportedly withdrew his name from consideration on Wednesday, at the same time his name started to be linked to Rutgers. Syracuse will reportedly hire Bowling Green coach Dino Babers.
A native of Ottumwa, Iowa, Ash has no head coaching experience and no apparent ties to New Jersey. Prior to landing at Ohio State in 2014, Ash spent one season as the defensive coordinator at Arkansas and two seasons as the defensive coordinator at Wisconsin. He has also been an assistant at Iowa State, San Diego State and Drake, where he played defensive back from 1992-96.
Ash was an assistant at Wisconsin from 2010-12, serving as defensive coordinator in his final two seasons with the Badgers. Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez is friends with Rutgers board of governors chairman Greg Brown. Brown watched Rutgers' 48-10 loss at Wisconsin on Oct. 31 in Alvarez' suite, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
Ash is known for running an aggressive 4-3 defensive scheme. Ohio State stifled Rutgers' offense in a 49-7 blowout this season by bringing eight men into the box to stop the run and playing press man-coverage with its cornerbacks.
Ohio State coach Urban Meyer hired Ash in 2014 to revamp the team's defense. The Buckeyes ranked 19th in total defense and 26th in scoring defense nationally while winning the national championship in 2014. They rank 10th in total defense and second in scoring defense nationally this season.
Meyer's coaching tree includes Houston's Tom Herman, Utah's Kyle Whittingham, Texas' Charlie Strong, Mississippi State's Dan Mullen, Oregon State's Gary Andersen and Boston College's Steve Addazio.
Ash mostly recruited the Midwest and South while at Ohio State. He made $590,000 as Ohio State's defensive coordinator.

An explosion at a nuclear plant in France has killed one person, injured three others and may have caused radiation to leak from the plant, French media reported today.
The Marcoule site is located in Langedoc Roussillon, in southern France, near the Mediterranean Sea.
The explosion reportedly took place in or near a foundry used to melt the waste, which has varying levels of radioactivity.

When contacted by Metro , Jean Revest , spokesman for the Anti-Nuclear Collective Vaucluse appears more worried him:
“What is certain is that there are leaks. The average level of radiation that we measure a few miles of the site is higher that it is usually after the accident. “
“We are in touch with employees on the site claiming to be confined, he has said.
It is a building of several hundred square meters that exploded.
There have been an incident at Marcoule five months ago “. According to the ASN, May 25, 2011, a level 1 incident occurred in the incineration plant installation Centraco : detection of the fire alarm did not work. The system was repaired four days later.
[/box_dark]
Olivier Isnard, an emergency manager at France's Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety said that the explosion took place in the foundry of the waste processing plant, which was melting down about four tons of used radioactive metal containing at least 67,000 becquerels of radiation.
Isnard also spent a month in Japan as an adviser in the wake of the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima power plant in March.

“I expect these will confirm that there has been no environmental impact,” said Mr. Isnard,

From Hindustan Times:
There is a risk of a radioactive leak after an explosion killed at least one person and injured four others at the Marcoule nuclear site in the south of France, the state regulator said.
National electricity provider EDF confirmed the initial death toll following the explosion in an oven at the site in the Rhone Valley near the southern city of Nimes.
One of the injured is in a serious condition, France's Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) said.

The site is partly used by French nuclear giant Areva to produce MOX fuel which recycles plutonium from nuclear weapons.
Operational since 1956, Marcoule is a gigantic site run by the atomic energy organization Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA) and Areva NC.
Diversification of the site was started in the 1970s with the creation of the Phénix prototype fast breeder reactor, and is nowadays an important site fordecommissioning nuclear facilities activities.
Since 1995, the MELOX factory produces MOX from a mix of uranium and plutonium oxides. MOX is used to recycle plutonium from nuclear fuel; this plutonium comes from the COGEMA La Hague site.

Evangelia Petit of the Agency for Nuclear Safety said Monday an explosion had taken place but declined to provide any further details.
It hit the Centraco nuclear waste treatment centre belonging to the Socodei subsidiary of national electricity provider EDF, said a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Commissariat (CEA).
“For the time being nothing has made it outside,” a spokesman said.
A security perimeter has been set up around the installation, firefighters said, without being able to provide further details.
Officials in the Gard region confirmed Monday's explosion but also would not elaborate.
There is no clear information immediately available as to how much risk the incident poses.
The local Midi Libre newspaper, on its web site, said an oven exploded at the plant, killing one person and seriously injuring another.
Three other people have been hospitalized with lighter injuries in the explosion, the paper said.
Last March, a level 2 incident had already occurred in the same plant (on a scale up to 7). This incident was initially reported as “level 1” by Areva, but after reviewing the case, the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) decided to classify it as “level 2”. The ASN asserted it was “the failure of several safety requirements of the installation.”
The accident occurred at 11:45 a.m. (0945 GMT, 5:45 a.m. EDT) in a plant that treats nuclear waste operated by a subsidiary of France's EDF electricity company, the report said.
In Vienna, an official at the IAEA, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on record, said the agency was in contact with French authorities “trying to learn more about the nature of the explosion.”
Reactors
The site housed a number of the first generation French UNGG reactors, of which have all been shut down.
Since then, it has also operated a pressurized water reactor that was used for the purpose of producing Tritium. Cooling for all of the plants comes from the Rhône river.

It's another week of Rocksmith 2014 reveals! Yesterday the clue posted by Rocksmith's facebook page definitely took me back to my trip to Las Vegas, I had the fear…
“We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold.”
― Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
Which leads us to Avenged Sevenfold's tribute to the film and Dr. Thompson with Bat Country off their third album, City of Evil.
Avenged Sevenfold is a band with an absolutely massive fan base and fandom. Their music has always translated well to music games and of course with their DLC already being available for Rocksmith 2011, it seems like a great pick by Ubisoft SF!
Are you excited to tackle Syn's guitar solos once again?
My name is Marija Marković and I am graphic designer from Belgrade, Serbia. I am 26 years old, graduated from Faculty of applied arts and beside that I am graphic designer and student of History of Art. Combining football and design is very interesting because you can make a lot from these two and show that this sport can be presented in some other way. Players depicted on posters are, for the most part, my choice. Also I included those that my friends and my sister reminded me of and I really appreciate their input. Some of the players are still active and they play great and I combined them with real football legends such as Pele, Bobbie Moore, Zidane… I received comments such as “How come there are no goalkeepers, Maldini, Ronaldo, Stoichkov, Baggio, Best, Charlton…” and then I decided to expand it with 36 new posters which I'll be finishing soon and round off this project though I know that it will miss someone because the list of fantastic football players is endless. They will be uploaded in a few days, right before World Cup in Brasil. Unfortunately, Serbia is not participating this year but I will follow matches of Argentina and Italy.
The idea came quite spontaneously. First I wanted to have posters of Thierry Henry and some other football players which will be slightly different from those that can be found and purchased on the internet. When I finished the first series two months ago, I published it on my online portfolio on Behance.net which is available to everyone and that is how people slowly started to pay attention to it. I didn't have any particular goal on my mind with this project other then to bring it closer to people who are interested in the blend of design and football. I follow football as much as I can. I'm fan of Red Star, Atletico de Madrid and Arsenal. Occasionally I go to Red Star's matches and it can be fun. In recent years mostly because of the atmosphere at the stadium, rather than the game itself but it'll be better, I hope. One of my favorite matches that I attend is last year's Spanish Super Cup final between Atletico and Barcelona in Madrid – fantastic Atletico fans, great atmosphere, definitely the match that was worth seeing. A year before that, I went to Super Cup final between Real and Barcelona. However, Atletico made stronger impression on me. The fans of Atletico remind me of the Red Star's fans because they both have interesting choreographic, they are loud and a true support in every sense.
It was great doing these posters because some people who actually don't follow football at all found these posters very interesting and maybe this was something that can bring them football much closer. Find more on https://www.behance.net/gallery/15475665/The-Gods-Of-Football-(Part-I)

The Linux Foundation on Wednesday released a white paper that puts the estimated value of development R&D costs of its Collaborative Projects at US$5 billion.
The Linux Foundation has provided independent funding for the collaborative software projects since 2008 to fuel innovation across industries and ecosystems. More than 500 companies and thousands of developers from around the world contribute to these open source software projects.
The monetary value of the foundation's R&D efforts did not come into focus until earlier this year, according to Amanda McPherson, chief marketing officer for the Linux Foundation.
"We have been focusing more on hosting the projects, I would say, instead of analyzing them," she told LinuxInsider.
World-Changing Reach
The white paper, "A $5 Billion Value: Estimating the Total Development Cost of Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects," offers a state-of-the-industry assessment that open source is changing the world in which we live, according coauthors McPherson and Jeff Licquia, a software engineer at the Linux Foundation.
"Over the last few years every major technology category has been taken over by open source," said McPherson, "and so much opinion has been shared about the proliferation of open source projects -- but not about the value."
The model for building the world's most important technologies evolved from the old build-vs.- buy dichotomy, she noted, so it is important to understand the economic value of the current development model. That is one of the primary goals of the report.
Research 101
The report's findings are based on David A. Wheeler's Constructive Cost Model, or COCOMO, an algorithmic software cost estimation model established in 2002. It uses a basic regression formula laced with parameters derived from historical project data, as well as both current and future project characteristics.
Wheeler's initial study became a well-regarded assessment of the value of a Linux distribution. The Linux Foundation performed a similar assessment in 2008.
It evaluates the Software Lines of Code (SLOC) in a project and the estimated person years and development costs associated to produce a value of the development costs.
This report is the first attempt to estimate not only the cost of developing the technologies, but also the value they collectively deliver to the industry.
Big Impact
The report lends credence to the unquestionable growth and importance of open source in today's world. A side question is how big open source is now compared to years ago, noted Al Hilwa, program director for software development research at IDC.
"It is absolutely bigger. We are seeing some of the big companies like Microsoft and VMware pivot towards open source. It is a force to be reckoned with," he told LinuxInsider.
Not a day passes that Hilwa does not see some new DevOp startup that is building a model out of open source code. "There is enormous activity around open source code today."
R&D Findings
Using Wheeler's model, the report authors made some key findings:
The total lines of source code present today in Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects are 115,013,302.
The estimated, total amount of effort required to retrace the steps of collaborative development for these projects is 41,192.25 person years.
In other words, it would take 1,356 developers 30 years to recreate the code bases present in Linux Foundation's current Collaborative Projects.
The total economic value of this work is estimated to be more than $5 billion dollars.
"The results meet the Linux Foundation's expectations. We knew it would be a big number. I should note we were much more conservative in our assumptions than previous analyses by us and others of Linux," said McPherson.
What's Included
The current Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects include AllSeen Alliance, Automotive Grade Linux, Cloud Foundry Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Code Aurora Forum, Core Infrastructure Initiative and Dronecode.
The list continues: IO Visor, IoTivity, Kinetic Open Storage Project, Let's Encrypt, Node.js Foundation, Open Container Project and Open Mainframe Project.
More projects: OPNFV, Open Virtualization Alliance, OpenDaylight, openMAMA, R Consortium, Tizen, Xen Project and Yocto Project.
New Collaborative Projects announced this week include ODPi, ON.Labs and the Open API Initiative. Not all projects were included in the analysis due to a number of them just having become LF Collaborative Projects.
Study's Impact
The white paper emphasizes how long it would take to recreate the code with a large development team rather than by using open source methods. Open source has passed the point of no return, said McPherson.
"You just won't see single organizations trying to shoulder the burden of developing complex infrastructure on their own," she said.
Technical executives may benefit more from the report than developers, as it gives executives who are evaluating their open source strategies fuel for decision-making.
"It shows how valuable the projects are to use as part of a technology strategy," said McPherson. "It also shows a really interesting progression of open source adoption from people using open source, to open sourcing key technology, to now collaborating together with their peers and competitors on these large scale projects."
Winning Factors
Software is "transforming industries like transportation and healthcare," said McPherson. At the same time, the software industry itself is undergoing a massive shift.
Services and speed to market are key. So is managing the complexities inherent in deploying all those billions of code lines.
"Open source is the keystone of both of these shifts. The value shown by our report and the commercial adoption of this code paints a clear and compelling vision of the future for open source," McPherson said.
Scruffy Days Are Over
"Showing the total economic value of free/libre and open source software helps move from the perception of free software being community theater, and clearly shows it is professional," said Todd Weaver, CEO of Purism Computer.
"The benefit for software developers is that they can point to cash value for their software released under free licenses," he told LinuxInsider, "but the largest benefit is to those on the fence about free/libre and open source software, because average users realize that the quality is on par with, or in some cases superior to, the proprietary counterparts."

Two species that couldn't be more different have had similarly good news this week.
First we go to Utah's Zion National Park, where a pair of California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) successfully hatched a chick in a nest more than 300 meters off the ground. This is the first wild condor birth in Utah since the massive birds were reintroduced in nearby Arizona in 1996. The species nearly went extinct a few decades ago but the last 22 birds were collected in 1987 and placed into a captive breeding program.
The exact location of the nesting chick has not been disclosed to protect the newborn from prying eyes. Biologists from the Peregrine Fund, an NGO that conserves wild birds of prey, found the nest by following the chick's parents, each of which had been fitted with a radio transmitter.
Other condors have attempted to breed in Zion National Park but no chicks were born. One of the breeding pairs died of lead poisoning in 2012. Another died the same way in 2013. Lead ammunition is still legal in Utah; condors ingest pellets that are in gut piles or carcasses left by hunters and frequently die as a result.
Moving south, our next piece of good news comes from Mexico, where a litter of five Mexican wolf pups (Canis lupus baileyi) was born in the wild in that country for the first time in more than 30 years. Once seen as a pest, the subspecies was all but wiped out in the mid-1900s by rampant hunting and poisoning. Like the condors, the last five wolves were collected and placed into captive breeding programs. A release program in two southwestern U.S. states started in 1998; Mexico began reintroductions in 2011. The parents of the new litter were just released in the Sierra Madre Mountains about eight months ago.
There are now about 83 Mexican wolves in the wild in the U.S., including 17 newborn pups. These are considered "experimental populations" under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, meaning they do not have the law's full protection and they can once again be gathered up and placed back in captivity at any time. A few hundred other animals live in zoos and other breeding centers. As with the condors, the location of the five wolf pups has not been released.
Both California condors and Mexican wolves still have a long way to go before they can be considered recovered but these births are important steps on what will be a decades-long journey.

Hm. I think it really depends.
Take my mother for example. She is 100% Chinese yet she does not speak the language and she has never been to China. Her family does still participate in Chinese traditions like CNY, etc. but they are fourth generation and in essence she is completely Americanized with white culture. She also grew up in northern Massachusetts, which is very, VERY white. She was surrounded by white culture growing up and I believe as a result she finds white men the most attractive because there were very few other choices. She was the only Asian at her high school besides her sister and there were a handful of black kids, but EVERYONE ELSE was Caucasian.
She doesn't think all other races are unattractive, but she has only ever dated white men because she was only ever around white men when she was in the dating pool. In this case, I think she is completely justified in dating white men because she did not consciously choose to reject all other races. It was societal pressures and her environment that led to her "choosing" white men.
I think if an Asian woman categorically rejects all races besides white men and is mean and dismissive to all other races even when they are in a very diverse environment, that is very wrong and a bit of a problem and possibly racism towards their own race.
HOWEVER, preferences are a real thing and no one is inherently a bad person for sincerely liking romantic/sexual partners of a certain race over others.
Police Whistle-Blower's Suit Reinstated
Probe: Appeals court says civil rights action against Pomona over alleged retaliation can proceed.
Blair sued the department a year later, claiming that its hierarchy left him defenseless against retaliation from colleagues who allegedly stole his equipment, interfered with his radio calls, threatened to kill him and his family, and scrawled the word "rat" on his locker.
Blair's allegations that officers stole money and planted drugs on suspects helped spark a 1995 internal investigation that eventually led to the dismissal of 25 criminal prosecutions and the firing of three officers. Two of the officers were later reinstated.
The ruling, issued Tuesday by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, condemned a "code of silence" among police in general and specifically reinstated the civil rights lawsuit of Pomona policeman Jed Arno Blair.
Pomona officials were considering Wednesday whether to appeal a court ruling that has revived a federal lawsuit by a Police Department whistle-blower who helped launch a Rampart-like probe.
"This case reveals what happens to good police officers who violate the code of silence," said Blair's attorney, Anne Richardson, on Wednesday. "This happened long before the Rampart scandal and shows the code of silence is a nationwide problem. And we want a jury to send a message that this won't be tolerated."
Pomona City Atty. Greg Docimo said: "Obviously we're disappointed in what the court said. We haven't decided whether we'll appeal or what the next step may be."
Mayor Eddie Cortez declined to comment. Police Chief Fred Sanchez said the incidents occurred before he came on board in 1998, but he denied that there is a code of silence in the department. Blair is currently a corporal on patrol duty.
In April 1995, Blair said Officer Michael Olivieri had told him that he witnessed colleagues on the major crimes task force violate numerous laws, including stealing money, throwing a couch at a suspect and taking heroin from one suspect and planting it on another.
Blair said Olivieri asked him to keep the information secret, but Blair informed a lieutenant and warned Olivieri, who then spoke to the chief. An internal investigation led to the terminations and case dismissals.
The district attorney's office declined to charge the officers, citing "insufficient evidence."
In the weeks after Blair made his revelations, according to court documents, Olivieri, who was given 24-hour protection, received the message "187-187" on his pager--the number of the California penal code section for murder.
Meanwhile Blair said his locker was spat in and wired shut with a coat hanger. His equipment was stolen, shirts were dumped in a urinal and soda was poured into his patrol car, he said.
According to the suit, Blair's complaints were ignored and he was transferred to the very task force he exposed. The day the three officers were dismissed, the document says, Blair's wife got a phone call warning that her husband might come home with broken legs and "that they should get rid of the whole . . . family."
Soon after, Blair went on medical leave and left the department, but he was forced to return when he couldn't find law enforcement work elsewhere, his attorney said. Chief Sanchez has ordered Blair not to speak about the suit or the department, the lawyer added.
Blair sued the city in September 1996. The suit was dismissed in February 1998 by U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew, who said Blair could not show the department's "custom or policy violated civil rights."
Authorities in North Korea are stepping up inspections on households with television sets imported from neighboring China, specially targeting LCD sets with USB ports and remote control functions, in Pyongyang's latest attempt to prevent citizens from accessing foreign media, according to sources.
North Koreans living along the Chinese border believe that such inspections are meant to block them from watching the Asian Games to be hosted by arch-rival neighbor South Korea.
Imported television sets are capable of receiving foreign broadcasts.
North Korea had earlier threatened to pull out of the Sept. 19-Oct. 4 Asian Games after Seoul refused to cover the cost of accommodating a large team at the event, but finally decided to send 273 athletes and officials tot he Games.
As of mid-August, Pyongyang's censorship unit, known as “109 Sangmu,” has been visiting “every” household in Yanggang province, which borders China, to inspect their television sets, a source told RFA's Korean Service, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The source said censors had removed USB ports on the LCDs and deliberately broke equipment on the TVs so that viewers could not use remote-control devices.
Aside from better display quality, LCD television sets have features that can link multiple external devices, including USB flash drives on which North Koreans illegally download South Korean soap operas and other entertainment as well as information on developments overseas.
Foreign broadcasts and CDs and DVDs are prohibited in North Korea, where television is the most accessed media platform. Approved TVs and radios are programmed to receive only official channels in the reclusive country where there is effectively no Internet and the Intranet is tightly monitored.
Unpopular move
Sources said some residents had resisted the move by authorities to remove the USB terminals from the LCD sets.
Some of them hid their TVs or just tried to fend off inspectors, said another source in Yanggang province, who also declined to be identified.
The source said the government had more thoroughly inspected residents' LCD television sets than analog TVs because the former come with the capability for watching foreign programs while operating at a low voltage.
“The price of a Chinese-made LCD television on the market varies from about U.S. $50 for a 5.5-inch (nearly 14 cm) portable set to about U.S. $500 for a 42-inch (107 cm) set,” said a resident of North Hamgyong province.
The source said that merchants secretly sold portable LCD television sets so viewers could watch foreign programs on the units.
Elite privilege
Those considered “elites”—people with political or economic influence and financial means greater than that of average citizens—usually have access to advanced types of media technology, including USB drives, according to the consultancy group InterMedia.
Such technology makes it easier to access, conceal, and share foreign content, especially for those who live along the border with China.
Many North Koreans watch foreign programs saved on USB devices, which are compact and easy to conceal from government inspectors, said the InterMedia report, released in 2012 and commissioned by the U.S. State Department.
Despite strict regulations and severe penalties, North Koreans—especially the elite—have had greater access to news and other media outside the government-controlled media.
Although Internet access remains tightly controlled, access to radio and DVDs are commonplace along with television in border areas.
The report also noted that more North Koreans had access to TVs sets capable of receiving outside broadcasts, despite official regulations that require televisions to be fixed only to certain national channels.

PAUL J. RICHARDS/Getty Images Social Security recipients displaced by Hurricane Katrina lined up for hours at one of the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, offices in September 2005.
When is a consumer choice not just a consumer choice?
Apparently when the shopper is a recipient of welfare, researchers have found. According to a recent study from the University of British Columbia, people on welfare who make ethical purchases, like organic food or hybrid cars, are judged as immoral for "taking advantage of public generosity."
"We discovered a double standard where people are judged differently for making identical choices, depending on where their money comes from," Darren Dahl, the study's author, said in a press release.
The series of five studies was designed to examine the relationship between two social values, making ethical consumer choices and thrift. The researchers asked more than 1,300 participants to judge people's morality based on their grocery lists and cars. They found that, while most people are judged to be virtuous when they make ethical purchases, people on welfare were "only praised when they're frugal."
The two reasons for this polarized opinion, according to the study, are price -- ethical goods usually cost more than conventional ones -- and "deservingness," the right to spend money however you want, which people tend to accord those who earn money but not those who receive government assistance.
"People on welfare tend to be seen as undeserving of more expensive options and of wasting taxpayers' hard-earned cash," Dahl said in the press release.
However, this perception doesn't stand up to the facts. The average SNAP food stamp benefit is only about $125 per month per person, as The Huffington Post has written. And the vast majority of welfare recipients aren't abusing "the system" to live large -- they're trying, really hard, to make ends meet.
According to a recent breakdown of expenditures by families receiving welfare, they spend a fraction of what regular families spend on basically everything -- half as much on housing, one-third less on food and less than one-fifth the amount on healthcare.
After stonewalling for 18 days Texas State Representative Byron Cook, chairman of the Texas House State Affairs committee, has finally moved on HB 14, a bill that will prevent municipal and county funds from going to abortion facilities like Planned Parenthood.
The bill, filed by Rep. Drew Springer was filed on July 20th of the special session, was passed out of committee on July 27th. At 7:42 PM on August 13th, Chairman Byron Cook finally distributed the bill out of committee so it can be considered in the Calendars committee.
Last week, Jonathan Stickland took to the back mic on the House floor to question Chairman Byron Cook on the bill. Since he would not come to the floor Stickland questioned the man who appointed him, Speaker Joe Straus. Speaker Straus was of little help.
It's not Democrats holding up pro-life legislation in the Texas House. It's the Republicans that are stopping their passage… #passthemall #onward Posted by Jonathan Stickland on Thursday, August 10, 2017
The bill will prevent local governmental entities from entering into a contract with any abortion provider or with an affiliate.
If you are new to following conservative politics in Texas then you should come to realize this is how bills die. Most Texas Republicans know they cannot actually vote against a pro-life bill and win their primary again so they make sure they never have to take that vote. They elect leadership that will take all the blame that lives in a safe more moderate district like Speaker Straus. Then he appoints powerful chairmen several weeks after the regular session begins. They then make sure to hold on to any legislation and pass it late in the session. Then it is held in the Calendar committee for a time and it along with a hundred of other bills that conservatives want are placed on the final week's calendar. Then time just runs out. Then play for pity to their constituents and ask “how can you blame we poor pitiful Republicans who only have near two-thirds majority for trying and running out of time?”
In comparison, this is how fast the Texas House can work when it is really motivated. This is SB 17. It had a companion bill passed out two weeks earlier which generally explains the bypassing of the public hearing, but notice the entire process was done in two days.
The special session will end on Wednesday, August 16th. It is very likely many of Gov. Greg Abbott's priorities like HB 14 on the call will not be passed.
(CNN) Russian track and field athletes seem unlikely to compete at the 2016 Olympic Games after their ban from international competition was extended on Friday, with damning accusations made about the country's lack of anti-doping efforts.
The International Association of Athletics Federations council met in Vienna to discuss lifting the suspension, but made a "unanimous" decision that Russia had not met its requirements in tackling the country's doping problem.
"Although significant progress has been made, several important criteria were not satisfied," Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF's independent task force, told reporters.
"The deep-seated culture of tolerance of doping appears not to have been changed materially. The head coach of Russian athletics and many athletes appear unwilling to acknowledge extent of the doping problem and ignore the anti-doping rules."
Coe, a former Olympic gold medalist, has come under fire for his praise for predecessor Diack, whom he called the sport's "spiritual leader" when he took over the role in August 2015. He told CNN he would "do anything to fix our sport."

The report claims Balakhnichev, Melnikov and Papa Massata Diack "conspired together ... to conceal for more than three years anti-doping violations by an athlete at what appeared to be the highest pinnacle of her sport. All three compounded the vice of what they did by conspiring to extort what were in substance bribes from Shobukhova by acts of blackmail."

Russia's former athletics president Valentin Balakhnichev, its ex-chief coach for long-distance athletes Alexei Melnikov and former IAAF consultant Papa Massata Diack have all been banned for life. The report said "far from supporting the anti-doping regime, they subverted it." The IAAF's former anti-doping director Gabriel Dollé has been given a five-year ban.

The Norwegian's task force also found that Russia has still not created "a strong and effective anti-doping infrastructure capable of detecting and deterring doping."
It also reported that Russian authorities had "orchestrated systematic doping and the covering up of adverse analytical findings."
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will meet next Tuesday to decide whether to uphold the IAAF's decision, which will determine if Russia's track and field team can compete in Rio in August.
"We now appeal to the members of the (IOC) to not only consider the impact that our athletes' exclusion will have on their dreams and the people of Russia, but also that the Olympics themselves will be diminished by their absence," said the Russian Ministry of Sport, which added that it was "extremely disappointed by the IAAF ruling.

IAAF president Sebastian Coe said the decision was made "in the best interests of the sport."
"We have to make sure that for generations to come, that athletes are competing, the public have confidence in what they're watching, and that we have athletes in safe and secure systems," Britain's two-time Olympic gold medalist told CNN's Amanda Davies in Vienna.
The IAAF said it has brought in a new rule which will allow Russian athletes who have been training in other countries under more rigorous anti-doping regimes to appeal to compete at the Olympics as independent entries.
"It is possible that there are athletes who are not tainted under the Russian system ... the doping review board will make an assessment," Coe told reporters.
Andersen said any Russian athlete who has made an "extraordinary effort" to fight doping -- such as whistleblower Yulia Stepanova -- could also apply to compete as an independent.
Before the decision was officially announced by the IAAF, Russian news agency Tass published quotes from athletes unhappy with the ruling, following earlier confirmation by Russian athletics' secretary general Mikhail Butov.

"I am in shock," javelin thrower Very Rebrik told Tass. "I will keep getting ready for the Olympics until the very end, no matter what happens, as I am not involved in all of these scandals."
"This is an unfair decision," triple jumper Yekaterina Koneva told Tass. "The big question is why they are doing this to Russia."
Pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, who won Olympic gold in 2004 and 2008, went even further, saying: "This is a violation of human rights. I will not be silent. I will take measures."
Russian President Vladimir Putin said before the announcement that "there can't be a collective responsibility for all the athletes or the athletes of a certain federation, if certain individuals have been found using doping. The entire team should not be responsible for those who committed the violation."
Speaking later at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin added: "Let me emphasize that we have never supported any violations in sports.
"We have never supported that at the state level. And we will never support this. We will never support any doping or any other violations in this area. And we are going to cooperate with all the international organizations in this regard."
The IAAF issued a provisional ban against Russian track and field athletes from international competition in November on the heels of an explosive report by the World Anti-Doping Agency that detailed what the agency said was widespread doping in Russian athletics.
The report detailed a "deeply rooted culture of cheating at all levels" of Russian athletics and implicated athletes, coaches, doctors, laboratory personnel and government officials.
On Wednesday, WADA released a new report detailing what it said were Russian efforts to obstruct testing, including intimidation from armed federal security agents.
It said Friday it "fully supports" the IAAF decision and is now awaiting the results of its own independent report, which it hopes to release within five days of its submission on July 15.
"It is clear there is a serious need for culture change in Russia within government and among sports leaders, athletes and athlete support personnel," WADA president Craig Reedie said in a statement.
"We do not consign blame or responsibility upon MIT for what has happened, but call for all those feel heavy-hearted in their proximity to this awful loss to acknowledge instead the responsibility they have — that we all have — to build and safeguard a future that would make Aaron proud," read the message. US federal prosecutors have meanwhile dropped charges against Swartz. Such filings are routine when a defendant dies before trial. Charges dropped ... Aaron Swartz. US Attorney Carmen Ortiz and the lead prosecutor on the case, Assistant US Attorney Stephen Heymann, filed a three-line notice of dismissal in court Monday. Swartz was indicted in 2011 on 13 counts, including wire fraud and computer fraud. Prosecutors alleged he illegally gained access to millions of academic articles through the academic database JSTOR. His trial was scheduled to begin in April, and faced the possibility of millions of dollars in fines and up to 35 years in prison.
Swartz's family says his suicide was "the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach". The case was seen as a showdown pitting the government and commercial interests against Internet "freedom fighters." MIT President L. Rafael Reif appointed Hal Abelson, a professor of computer science and engineering and a founding director of Creative Commons and the Free Software Foundation, to "lead a thorough analysis of MIT's involvement". His death is being used to question governments' aggressive criminal prosecution of internet activists. Tributes
As news spread over the weekend of Swartz's death, the web collectively mourned for a brilliant young technologist and activist who wanted to set the world's information free yet could never escape his own demons. One friend confided: "I'm not surprised that this is how his life ended, and I bet many others feel the same way. So sad, he had so much potential and not enough joy in his life." Swartz was just 14 when he helped create RSS, a tool that distributes online content, but he was best known as an activist for free and open access to the world's information. "Everything he did was aimed at world-changing and at activism," said friend and historian Rick Perlstein. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor and fellow internet activist, wrote in a blog post that the criminal case against Swartz was misguided. Swartz "consulted me as a friend and lawyer" in the MIT case, and he didn't seek to profit from downloading academic papers, Lessig wrote.
"From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterise what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way," Lessig said. "The outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor's behaviour." Other academics took to Twitter to honour Swartz by posting free versions of their publications online, using the identifying hashtag #pdftribute. Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, said on Twitter that she met Swartz 11 years ago when she was an executive at Google. "We had found his blog and were blown away by his age [16] and insights," she said. Loading
A funeral will be held on January 15 at a synagogue in Highland Park, Illinois, near Chicago, according to the Swartz family statement. He is survived by his parents, Robert and Susan; younger brothers Noah and Ben; and his partner, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, according to a statement. Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg/AP

In politics, as in baseball, the rule is simple: Three strikes and you're out.
When Stephen Harper finally shambles towards the showers, head down, bat in hand, I'll be thinking of Mighty Casey. For much of his career, Harper has umpired his own at-bats. But that role will soon — if briefly — fall to the people of Canada. Election Day is coming to Mudville.
Strike one against this government of oligarchs and corporate shills comes down to this: They have greedily championed oil and gas while doing nothing to protect air and water. Consider the piece of legislation with the Orwellian name — the Navigable Waters Protection Act. NDP house leader Nathan Cullen said it as well as anyone could:
“It means the removal of almost every lake and river we know from the Navigable Waters Protection Act. From one day to the next, we went from 2.5 million protected lakes and rivers in Canada to 159 lakes and rivers protected.”
On second thought, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May put it pretty well too: “In Bill C-38, Stephen Harper cancelled and gutted environmental laws brought in by Brian Mulroney. He's now moved on to destroy environmental law brought in by Sir John A. MacDonald.”
And who gave the Conservatives the blueprint for gutting the Navigable Waters Protection Act? The pipeline industry. The new legislation gave them a big plum: Along with power lines, pipelines were removed from the legislation altogether.
After eight years in office, Harper's promise to regulate the energy sector remains as empty as the look behind his eyes. There's a reason the Green Party just enjoyed the best fundraising year in its short history. May, like most Canadians, sees the big picture: All Stephen Harper has done in office is play shortstop to big business.
Canada now has more corrupt companies on the World Bank's blacklist than any other country in the world. A stunning 115 of those companies are comprised of disgraced engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — the same company that the Harper government supported with an $800 million loan guarantee to build the dubious Muskrat Falls power development in Newfoundland and Labrador.
Big business keeps telling workers they can't have defined benefit pensions. Yet 43 per cent of Canadian CEOs have reserved that option for themselves. The PM has nothing to say about the gulf between worker and CEO pay packets.
The Conservatives have ignored the great issue of the age — the environment — and have offered instead a robber-baron vision of Canada built on unsustainable development and inflated oil prices. The lion's share of the benefits have gone to foreign corporations and speculators.
Albertans get a tenth of what Norwegians get from the sale of their non-renewables. Since the public owns those resources, this amounts to a form of theft.
The Harper government has sabotaged international efforts to set a bolder course on global warming. How badly has he betrayed the environment? We're talking Benedict Arnold here: He has transformed Environment Canada into just another oilpatch stooge, violating the purpose for which it was created.
He will drag out the usual mantra to continue his reign of error — that only Steve can protect us from terrorists, only Steve can protect us from recession, and only Steve has the stuff of leadership. I don't think it's working this time.
And for the third time in a year, the Harper government is trying to stop an investigation into Canada's environmental record. Although there is evidence that chemicals from toxic tailings ponds created by the tar sands are seeping into adjacent groundwater in Alberta, the Harper government is trying to terminate a proposed NAFTA probe into the environmental effects of tailings ponds. Poison leaching into the ground — and Harper doesn't want a factual record.
Of course he doesn't. He didn't want a factual record on endangered polar bears or salmon farm pollution. And remember, this is the guy who didn't mind selling asbestos to other countries when it was being treated as a deadly carcinogen here in Canada.
Strike two against Stephen Harper is his personal failure to give Canadians a more open, ethical and democratic government. That is, after all, what got him elected in 2006 (that and a little cheating during the campaign). So it was beyond hypocritical this past week for the PM to portray himself as a champion of democracy and free speech after the dreadful killings in Paris. He even politicizes tragedy.
Here is the real man … the one who dedicated his entire communications effort to smothering free speech, who undermined access to information, the life-blood of any democracy, with endless delays in handing over government documents that belong to us. In some cases, his government has simply — and unconstitutionally — refused to fork them over. He has also mused about charging $200 per access request — which would certainly suppress the urge to ask.
The real man has muzzled his own workers — even demanding loyalty oaths from them. He wanted the right to ask prospective government employees about their politics. He has viciously attacked any individual or institution that opposes him, from former parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.
The real man repeatedly has tried to turn the Internet into a servant of the police state, disguising his intent with nonsense about child pornographers and “protection”.
The real man has starved the opposition of even the most basic information about the budget and deprived Parliament of the ability to debate legislation through the cynical use of enormous omnibus bills.
Sheila Fraser has named the disease. Laws are being passed in Stephen Harper's Canada without scrutiny. (That didn't seem to bother the dear host of CBC's The Current when she interviewed on my new book. But it bothers me, and a lot of other people, a great deal.)
The real man doesn't speak to his fellow premiers as a group, banishes journalists from public buildings and thinks Sun News is where it's at.
It didn't take a genius to work out that Harper's reaction to the robocall scandal would be new legislation that will make it harder to catch cheaters the next time. And trust me, there will be a next time. So let it be said clearly: Stephen Harper is a champion of screwing free speech and democracy at every opportunity.
What's strike three? Canada is not Harperland. Stephen Harper is not who we are.
Canadians don't want to see medicare slowly reduced to a ghost of its former self by a prime minister who once headed an organization created to destroy it.
Despite the stunning selfishness of some of its stars, Canadians don't want to see the CBC brought to its knees and “restructured” by a man who prefers public relations to journalism.
Finally, Canadians don't want to save money on the backs of veterans who didn't take to the closet in the face of clear and present danger — especially when Harper has so egregiously used the military for political gain. There has to be more for our soldiers than bullets and beans.
Stephen Harper will definitely come out swinging when he comes to the plate. He will drag out the usual mantra to continue his reign of error — that only Steve can protect us from terrorists, only Steve can protect us from recession, and only Steve has the stuff of leadership.
I don't think it's working this time. I suspect that when Mighty Steve strikes out, there will be joy in Mudville.

Per Mertesacker says Arsenal's defeat at Swansea was a result of not playing "serious football" for a full 90 minutes.
Alexis Sanchez's 12th goal of the season gave the Gunners a second-half advantage but Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis struck inside three minutes to turn the game on its head.
Arsenal were disciplined and organised for much of Sunday's game but Mertesacker admits they let their standards slip after taking the lead.
"We have the potential and we have to extend 60 minutes [of performance] to 90 minutes, that's not a big issue" Per Mertesacker
"The game was completely in our hands, especially in the second half when we scored," he said. "Then we have to play serious football and not lose the ball but they got us on the break, and that's completely unbelievable in our situation.
"We have to play simple, even if we are 1-0 up - even more then. We played through the middle… but we need to keep possession and keep patient, something that we did all the way through until the 60th minute and we had the game in our hands completely. That's what I mean by serious football.
"When you get such a result [like against Anderlecht] normally you come back quickly and after such a setback normally we bounce back immediately. Today that was not the game and we have to take the break now really seriously and work hard on the issues."
Mertesacker is convinced that Arsenal can fix their problems - if they learn their lessons quickly.
"We have the potential and we have to extend 60 minutes [of performance] to 90 minutes, that's not a big issue.
"We played our game for 60 minutes with patience, seriously and they didn't have a proper chance. Then we scored and we thought we didn't need to keep possession or patience, and then we struggled. That was our fault and we did the same on Wednesday. We have to think about it quickly.
"We have good ideas on how we can extend the good 60 minutes into 90 minutes. It's absolutely necessary in the next couple of weeks. We struggled a bit but we have great potential and you can see that.
"Now we have some time to think about the few issues that cause trouble because we made mistakes in areas we have to avoid."
Michele Bachmann is the latest member of Congress to demonstrate that she does not completely understand unemployment legislation.
In a statement to MinnPost on Tuesday, the Minnesota Republican criticized the deal President Obama crafted with Republican leaders to preserve rich people's tax cuts for two years and extend unemployment benefits for 13 months.
"As part of the compromise, the President wants to extend unemployment benefits for another 13 months," Bachmann said. "Unemployment benefits are already at a historical length of 99 weeks, and the President's request would push benefits to three years."
Problem is, the president's request would do no such thing. It would preserve the 99 weeks by reauthorizing Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Extended Benefits programs, which together provide up to 73 weeks of benefits beyond the standard 26 funded by states.
Proposals to give the long-term unemployed in hardest-hit states an additional 20 weeks of benefits do exist, but those plans are going nowhere.
Bachmann is one of the loudest conservative critics of Obama's deal with congressional Republicans, which has also been panned by progressives.
(The version of the statement on Bachmann's website is better. It says, "Unemployment benefits are already at a historical length of 99 weeks, and the President's request will cost another $56 billion.")
Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) made a similar mistake on the Senate floor last week. "This is about people who have been collecting unemployment benefits for 99 weeks," Barrasso said, incorrectly. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) followed up by saying, strangely, that the bill would give people laid off that Thursday the "same opportunity to receive some temporary help as the person who lost their job on Monday or Tuesday."
HuffPost first reported in November that members of Congress don't understand the difference between extending benefits and reauthorizing benefits. Congress failed to reauthorize the extended benefits before they lapsed last week, jeopardizing aid for two million long-term unemployed this month alone.
Not understanding unemployment legislation is different than not having a clue about what it's like to struggle to find work, but that's another story.
Kem Ley, a popular political commentator and frequent critic of Prime Minister Hun Sen, was shot dead at a Phnom Penh gas station on Sunday morning, according to military police.
Eng Hy, spokesman for the National Military Police, said Kem Ley was identified by officers at the scene.
“According to reports we just received, it's Kem Ley,” he said. “He is dead.”
Mr. Hy declined to answer further questions about the case.
Officers at the scene—a convenience shop at the Caltex gas station at the intersection of Monivong and Mao Tse Toung boulevards—said the shooting happened at about 9 a.m. and that the shooter had fled the scene.
Kirth Chantharith, spokesman for the National Police, said at about 10:30 a.m. that officers had already arrested a man over the shooting.
“Police made an arrest immediately after the shooting happened,” he said, declining to give any further information.
A longtime analyst of Cambodia's fractious political scene, Kem Ley founded the grassroots Khmer for Khmer advocacy group in 2014 with the aim of helping spark the formation of localized political parties across the country.
The Grassroots Democracy Party was formed by his colleagues the following year, but Kem Ley himself disavowed any personal political ambitions of his own. He had continued to regularly appear on the radio and in the press to discuss political issues of the day.

Tonya Couch, expected to appear in Tarrant County court Friday, is seeking to reduce her bond from $1 million to $15,000. (Published Thursday, Jan. 7, 2016)
The mother of a fugitive teen who used an "affluenza" defense after killing four people in a drunken crash returned to North Texas to face charges Thursday.
Tonya Couch arrived by plane at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Thursday at about 1:30 p.m. after an extradition hearing two days earlier in Los Angeles.
LA County sheriff's spokesperson Nicole Nishida said Couch left jail at 5 a.m. Thursday.
Couch, 48, is charged in Texas with hindering the apprehension of a felon and is being held at the Tarrant County Lon Evans Correction Center on a $1 million bond. There is a bond reduction hearing scheduled Monday at 1:30 p.m. Couch's attorney's are expected to request her bond be lowered from $1 million to $15,000.

Couch Returns to North Texas
Couch arrived at the Tarrant County Jail in a sheriff's van with Sheriff Dee Anderson riding in the front seat. She was shackled as she exited the van.
Anderson told reporters he did talk to her during the transport from the airport to the jail, but never about the charge she faces but about administrative issues with her care at the jail.
"She was very quiet, very reserved, she was respectful," said Anderson. "Surprisingly she was very appreciative, she said that he deputies on the way back had treated her as well as she ever expected to be treated."
When asked if she wanted to accept any offers for jailhouse interviews, Anderson said, "She said not only no, but really no."
She is expected to be arraigned at 9 a.m. Friday in state District Judge Wayne Salvant's court.
Explaining the Process of Transferring Person in Custody
NBC 5 Law Enforcement Expert Don Peritz explains the process of transferring a person in custody between jurisdictions, such as we saw Thursday with Tonya Couch. (Published Thursday, Jan. 7, 2016)
Couch agreed on Tuesday to be sent from California to Texas.
Earlier this week, her attorneys released a statement saying she had done nothing illegal and wanted to get back to Texas as soon as possible.
"While the public may not like what she did, may not agree with what she did, or may have strong feelings against what she did, make no mistake — Tonya did not violate any law of the State of Texas and she is eager to have her day in court," lawyers Stephanie K. Patten and Steve Gordon said in the statement.
She was flown to Los Angeles last week after being deported from Mexico, where she and her 18-year-old son, Ethan, were arrested. Ethan Couch remains detained in Mexico City.
Authorities believe the pair fled there in November as Texas prosecutors investigated whether he had violated his probation in a car crash that killed four people.
NBC 5's Kevin Cokely and Holley Ford contributed to this report.

Arkansas Leads U.S. in Most Mumps Cases Video
(via KARK) -- U.S. health officials are dealing with an outbreak of mumps and say Arkansas leads the six states reporting the most cases.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the U.S. has been hit with the most mumps cases in a decade.
The CDC says mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus spread through saliva and mucus. A major factor contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team, or living in a dormitory with a person who has mumps.
As of Nov. 5, there are more than 2,800 cases nationwide. The CDC says outbreaks in two states are behind many of the cases (Arkansas has 1870 and Iowa has 683 cases).
Four other states -- Indiana, Illinois, Massachusetts and Oklahoma, have also reported more than 100 cases this year.

A resident's surveillance video tipped off police and led to the arrest of a burglary ring of seven people suspected of committing three burglaries at once in a Glendora neighborhood. Hetty Chang reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017. (Published Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017)
A ring of seven suspected burglars were arrested on suspicion of attempting to simultaneously commit three burglaries in a residential neighborhood in Glendora, police said Wednesday.
A resident of the 200 block of North Greencroft Avenue called police about 9 p.m. Tuesday to report that while he was monitoring his home surveillance cameras he saw some suspects wearing ski masks in his yard, the Glendora Police Department reported.
Officers dispatched to the scene set up a containment of the neighborhood. They saw what they believed to be a suspicious silver Mercedes- Benz SUV occupied by two men.
"This vehicle was stopped and the investigation led to both occupants being arrested in connection to the burglary," according to a Glendora Police Department statement.
About the same time officers heard a woman screaming inside her home and then saw three men run from that home. The homeowners had just arrived and interrupted a burglary in progress at the same time police officers were containing the area from the original call.
All three suspects ran in different directions with one being captured immediately, while the remaining two ran in separate directions.
"Several loaded firearms that had just been stolen from the residence were thrown by the suspects in the street and in a nearby yard," according to the news statement.
Soon after, a another neighbor in the area called to report a suspicious person in her neighbor's yard. Based upon this tip, officers located the second suspect hiding in a crawlspace on this property and he was taken in custody without incident.
While a search including police dogs was underway, a second vehicle driven by a woman pulled up in the area.
"The investigation revealed that she was attempting to rescue the final outstanding suspect and she was arrested for accessory to the burglary," according to the news statement.
"The final outstanding suspect was found hiding in that vehicle and was arrested after struggling officers and a police dog."
A short time later, a third suspicious vehicle occupied by two women was seen driving slowly in the area. This vehicle had the license plates removed and both occupants were arrested on suspicion of being an accessory to a burglary.
A passenger in that vehicle was later released without charges.
Arrested were Doncell Hannah, 23, of Palmdale; Christopher Hicks, 24, of Pasadena; Howard Vaughn IV, 24, of Pasadena; Elante Gilliam, 25, of Altadena; Roger Tillotson, 22, of Adelanto; Jonee Barnett, 25, of Lancaster; and Kayla Hunter, 28, of Pasadena.
Hicks and Vaughn are on probation and were being held without bail.
Hannah, Gilliam, and Tillotson were being held in lieu of $500,000 bail. Barnett and Hunter were being held in lieu of $20,000 bail, but have since posted bond.
The suspects were charged with crimes including residential burglary, home invasion robbery, kidnapping, conspiracy, being a felon in possession of a firearm and resisting arrest.
Anyone with information regarding these suspects or these vehicles was asked, please contact the Glendora Police Department at (626) 914-8250.

The Pleasures of the Flesh
If you care about hunger, eat less meat.
By George Monbiot. Published in the Guardian 15th April 2008
Never mind the economic crisis. Focus for a moment on a more urgent threat: the great food recession which is sweeping the world faster than the credit crunch.
You have probably seen the figures by now: the price of rice has risen by three-quarters in the past year, that of wheat by 130%(1). There are food crises in 37 countries. One hundred million people, according to the World Bank, could be pushed into deeper poverty by the high prices(2). But I bet you have missed the most telling statistic. At 2.1bn tonnes, last year's global grain harvest broke all records(3). It beat the previous year's by almost 5%. The crisis, in other words, has begun before world food supplies are hit by climate change. If hunger can strike now, what will happen if harvests decline?
There is plenty of food. It is just not reaching human stomachs. Of the 2.13bn tonnes likely to be consumed this year, only 1.01bn, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), will feed people(4).
I am sorely tempted to write another column about biofuels. From this morning all sellers of transport fuel in the United Kingdom will be obliged to mix it with ethanol or biodiesel made from crops. The World Bank points out that “the grain required to fill the tank of a sports utility vehicle with ethanol … could feed one person for a year”(5). Last year global stockpiles of cereals declined by around 53m tonnes(6); this gives you a rough idea of the size of the hunger gap. The production of biofuels this year will consume almost 100m tonnes(7), which suggests that they are directly responsible for the current crisis. In the Guardian yesterday the transport secretary Ruth Kelly promised that “if we need to adjust policy in the light of new evidence, we will.”(8) What new evidence does she require? In the midst of a global humanitarian crisis, we have just become legally obliged to use food as fuel. It is a crime against humanity in which every driver in this country has been forced to participate.
But I have been saying this for four years and I am boring myself. Of course we must demand that our governments scrap the rules which turn grain into the fastest food of all. But there is a bigger reason for global hunger, which is attracting less attention only because it has been there for longer. While 100m tonnes of food will be diverted this year to feed cars, 760m tonnes will be snatched from the mouths of humans to feed animals(9). This could cover the global food deficit 14 times. If you care about hunger, eat less meat.
While meat consumption is booming in Asia and Latin America, in the United Kingdom it has scarcely changed since the government started gathering data in 1974. At just over 1kg per person per week(10), it's still about 40% above the global average(11), though less than half the amount consumed in the United States(12). We eat less beef and more chicken than we did 30 years ago, which means a smaller total impact. Beef cattle eat about 8kg of grain or meal for every kilogramme of flesh they produce; a kilogramme of chicken needs just 2kg of feed. Even so, our consumption rate is plainly unsustainable.
In his magazine The Land, Simon Fairlie has updated the figures produced 30 years ago in Kenneth Mellanby's book Can Britain Feed Itself? Fairlie found that a vegan diet grown by means of conventional agriculture would require only 3m hectares of arable land (around half the current total)(13). Even if we reduced our consumption of meat by half, a mixed farming system would need 4.4m hectares of arable fields and 6.4 million hectares of pasture. A vegan Britain could make a massive contribution to global food stocks.
But I cannot advocate a diet I am incapable of following. I tried it for about 18 months, lost two stone, went as white as bone and felt that I was losing my mind. I know a few healthy-looking vegans and I admire them immensely. But after almost every talk I give, I am pestered by swarms of vegans demanding that I adopt their lifestyle. I cannot help noticing that in most cases their skin has turned a fascinating pearl grey.
What level of meat-eating would be sustainable? One approach is to work out how great a cut would be needed to accommodate the growth in human numbers. The UN expects the population to rise to 9bn by 2050. These extra people will require another 325m tonnes of grain(14). Let us assume, perhaps generously, that politicians like Ms Kelly are able to “adjust policy in the light of new evidence” and stop turning food into fuel. Let us pretend that improvements in plant breeding can keep pace with the deficits caused by climate change. We would need to find an extra 225m tonnes of grain. This leaves 531m tonnes for livestock production, which suggests a sustainable consumption level for meat and milk some 30% below the current world rate. This means 420g of meat per person per week, or about 40% of the UK's average consumption.
This estimate is complicated by several factors. If we eat less meat we must eat more plant protein, which means taking more land away from animals. On the other hand, some livestock is raised on pasture, so it doesn't contribute to the grain deficit. Simon Fairlie estimates that if animals were kept only on land that's unsuitable for arable farming, and given scraps and waste from food processing, the world could produce between a third and two thirds of its current milk and meat supply(15). But this system then runs into a different problem. The FAO calculates that animal keeping is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental impacts are especially grave in places where livestock graze freely(16). The only reasonable answer to the question of how much meat we should eat is as little as possible. Let's reserve it – as most societies have done until recently – for special occasions.
For both environmental and humanitarian reasons, beef is out. Pigs and chickens feed more efficiently, but unless they are free range you encounter another ethical issue: the monstrous conditions in which they are kept. I would like to encourage people to start eating tilapia instead of meat. It's a freshwater fish which can be raised entirely on vegetable matter and has the best conversion efficiency – about 1.6kg of feed for 1kg of meat – of any farmed animal(17). Until meat can be grown in flasks, this is about as close as we are likely to come to sustainable flesh-eating.
Re-reading this article, I see that there is something surreal about it. While half the world wonders whether it will eat at all, I am pondering which of our endless choices we should take. Here is the price of food barely registers. Our shops are better stocked than ever before. We perceive the global food crisis dimly, if at all. It is hard to understand how two such different food economies could occupy the same planet, until you realise that they feed off each other.

It's always fun to look at different (micro)benchmarks comparing language/frameworks/systems to each other. I'm curious about real world examples where a change (preferably measurement/profiling driven) has lead to a significant positive outcome in performance, code quality/maintainability, etc. Did changing from Python to Go make it so that you could avoid horizontal scaling for the size of your app, reducing operational complexity? Did switching from Dart to Rails speed up development because of the wide range of libraries available, speeding up time to market? While most bottlenecks exist outside of languages/frameworks, I find it interesting when the language/framework actually made a difference. An example I'll use is switching an internal library from C# to F#: The module as designed mutated 3 large classes through a pipeline of operations to determine what further work was needed. I incrementally rewrote this module in type-driven F# with 63 types to model the data transformations and ensure that the correct outcome desired was compiler verified. In the process 3 bugs were fixed and 12 additional bugs were discovered that while edge cases, had a couple of old tickets with "unable to reproduce" as the last comment in the ticketing system. This could have been done in C# and because I did it in F# it is most likely slightly more difficult for the other team members to jump into. It probably also uses more memory to represent the types than the C# version. In this case however, the trade offs were worth it and I've been told the module has barely needed to be touched since.

Istanbul (AFP) - Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has threatened to "blow the mind" of Europe by sending 15,000 refugees a month to EU territory, in an intensifying dispute with the bloc.
Ankara and Brussels almost a year ago on March 18 signed a landmark deal that has substantially lessened the flow of migrants from Turkey to Europe.
But the accord is now hanging in the balance due to the diplomatic crisis over the blocking of Turkish ministers from holding rallies in Europe.
"If you want, we could open the way for 15,000 refugees that we don't send each month and blow the mind" of Europe, Soylu said in a speech late Thursday, quoted by the Anadolu news agency.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has already indicated that Turkey could rip up the deal and said Turkey was no longer readmitting migrants who crossed into Greece.

The crisis was sparked when the Netherlands and Germany refused to allow Turkish ministers to campaign in a April 16 referendum on expanding President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's powers, prompting the Turkish strongman to compare them with Nazi Germany.
Soylu, a hardliner considered close to Erdoğan, accused The Hague and Berlin of involvement in June 2013 anti-Erdogan protests, October 2014 pro-Kurdish riots and the July 15, 2016 failed coup attempt.
"They are trying to complete the work that they did not finish. Who is doing this work? It's the Netherlands and Germany," Soylu said.
He accused Europe of failing to help Turkey enter the bloc and of not helping with its fight against terror.
"Europe, do you have that kind of courage...? Let us remind you that you cannot play games in this region and ignore Turkey," he added.
The European Union had said it expects Turkey to continue implementing the deal, which drastically cut the numbers making the dangerous passage across the Aegean Sea.
The mass influx of migrants to Europe in summer 2015 was seen as boosting the support of the far-right on the continent.
A key pillar of the deal were pledges by Turkey to boost border security and break people-smuggling networks, moves that analysts say slowed the migrant flow to a trickle.
Erdoğan in November last year already threatened Europe with opening the frontiers of Turkey, which borders EU members Greece and Bulgaria.
The Rose Bowl is 60 minutes away, and there's only two contenders left to earn the Pac-12's automatic berth. The Stanford Cardinal and the Arizona State Sun Devils will duke it out in the Pac-12 Championship game at Sun Devil Stadium for the right to play in Pasadena on New Year's Day.
On Sept. 21, the Stanford Cardinal jumped out to a 29-0 halftime lead en route to a 42-28 victory against Arizona State. This time around, the game will be played in Tempe where the Sun Devils are 7-0 this season. Who has the upper hand? We asked our writers for their predictions:
Kerry Crowley: Stanford 30, Arizona State 24
It's the holiday season and there would be no better gift for Sun Devil fans than a trip to the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. This Arizona State team has given us every reason to believe that the Sun Devils are capable of winning the Pac-12 Championship, and that's why there's so much hope in Tempe nowadays. Watching as students gather at Camp Fargo for better seats and seeing alumni take to social media to talk about their stories of the '87 and '97 Rose Bowls has made this week a joy for the staff at House of Sparky.
But with all of that being said, I think the Sun Devils might be another year or two from making the trek out to Pasadena. I was at the Arizona State-Stanford game back in September and I've never seen a team I thought so highly of thoroughly dominated quite like the Sun Devils were in the first meeting between these two schools. I think that Todd Graham and his staff have done an outstanding job in progressing this team to its current state, but I still don't think the Sun Devils will beat the Cardinal. Stanford is the class of the Pac-12 and with offensive and defensive fronts that can out-physical and out-man any opponent it faces, I see the Cardinal taking this game by a narrow margin.
Bold Prediction: The Sun Devils have a lead at some point during the fourth quarter.
Cory Williams: Stanford 27, Arizona State 31
I already gave my prediction in the Bettor's Guide yesterday, but I will reiterate: Arizona State is an excellent home team and the home crowd will make the difference on Saturday.
It's true that the Sun Devils played a very bad first half against the Cardinal in September, but a lot has changed since then. The team has matured and grown; issues that plagued ASU have been rectified. We have seen a mature, experienced team over the past several weeks, pulling out gutsy wins against Utah and UCLA while crushing the rest of their opposition.
With all that said, Stanford is a cut above the rest of the Pac-12, and the Sun Devils must execute to perfection to have that opportunity to go to Pasadena on New Year's Day. Call me optimistic, but I think the Devils will defeat the Cardinal by a very close margin.
Bold Prediction: Either ASU's special teams or defense will put points on the board.
Nick Krueger: Stanford 38, Arizona State 31
Stanford's physicality is what worries me the most. The ASU front four can only do so much when the Cardinal decide to put eight men on the line and run it down their throat. No one in the Pac-12 enforces a slow, methodical tempo quite like Stanford and David Shaw can.
Now this will be a different kind of game, no doubt about it. Todd Graham has improved this team a lot since week three. I just can't seem to get over the fact that this is Stanford we're talking about here. The Sun Devils have a lot of weapons and they are disciplined when it comes to penalties but even on the road, there is something to be said about the Cardinal having been in this position before. Nothing outweighs experience and although ASU may be more talented, nothing helps more in the brightest lights than past experience.
The Sun Devils have to play a flawless, completely mistake-free four quarters of football and I just don't see that happening against a team like Stanford. I would like to think the Sun Devils will reach the mountaintop but anything worth doing doesn't come easy and I don't think this is the year for ASU.
Bold prediction: Arizona State has a halftime lead of 10 points or more.
Cody Ulm: Stanford 40, Arizona State 34
There's no doubting that when Arizona State has the luxury of playing at home, the Sun Devils are an entirely different beast. But there's also no doubting that Stanford is built to beat Arizona State, especially when Marion Grice is out of the picture.
The Sun Devils only legitimately struggled in three games this season: at Stanford, against Notre Dame and at Utah. The common denominator between those teams? Their physicality. And physicality is what knocks a rhythm team like Arizona State out of its comfort zone. On Saturday, I expect Stanford to knock the Sun Devils out of their rhythm when it matters most. Arizona State should jump out to a relatively quick lead but I just can't see the offense maintaining success deep into the game, especially considering the Devils have come out flat in the third quarter as of late.
For as much as I adore DJ Foster's skillset, he just isn't built to beat a stout front seven such as Stanford's. And after seeing how Arizona State's offense line was manhandled against the aforementioned three teams, I have a hard time believing they'll help Foster's cause much Saturday. The only way you can combat physicality is with physicality and that's certainly not Arizona State's strength. Arizona State will come out firing but the third and longs will pile up at a most precarious time. I still expect the Sun Devils to produce a performance that their fan's will be proud of. I just can't give the the W with Stanford's ability to control the trenches and kill the clock.
Bold Prediction: Arizona State will average under 2.5 yards per carry.
Ben Haber: Stanford 24, Arizona State 31
Home field advantage, check. Talent advantage, check. Quarterback advantage, check. Arizona State owns all three categories, although the talent conversation can go either way. The Sun Devils are more well=rounded than the Cardinal, which led me to the prediction.
As I said in Haber's Hunches, the Arizona State offense and Stanford defense cancel each other out. However, the Arizona State defense is a solid unit that continues to be on the rise. The Stanford offense is slightly above average and seems to be on the decline.
Regardless of the minor tactical strengths and weaknesses, the game should come down to the wire. When that's the case, quarterbacks usually decide the outcome. Taylor Kelly is the obvious pick over Kevin Hogan and there's no debate about it.
Since the beginning of the season, the atmosphere surrounding the Arizona State football program felt alive, thanks mainly to Todd Graham. The Arizona State objective was to end the journey in Pasadena, Calif. for the Rose Bowl, and it will become reality after Saturday night.
Bold Prediction: Chris Coyle accumulates at least 100 yards and one touchdown
April 24, 2017
Cormac McCarthy, the celebrated American novelist, author of ten novels, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award, is publishing his first-ever non-fiction science essay in Nautilus magazine. Called “The Kekulé Problem,” it explores the unconscious and the origin of human language, and is the cover story of the March/April issue. “The Kekulé Problem” was published online on April 20th at www.nautil.us.
The essay presents a new, surprising side of one of American's greatest writing talents. Readers of his novels, which include The Road, No Country for Old Men, and All the Pretty Horses, may not be aware that for more than two decades McCarthy has been a senior fellow at the Santa Fe Institute, a science research center.
In his introduction to McCarthy's essay, David Krakauer, president of SFI, notes that McCarthy is an aficionado in subjects ranging from the history of mathematics to the nature of the conscious. We learn he has been debating the nature of the unconscious mind for two decades.
McCarthy's essay is a groundbreaking, humanist take on a foundational question in science, and a remarkable window into the self-conception of one of America's greatest living writers. The essay can be read online, purchased in print form through the magazine's online store at shop.nautil.us, or found in bookstores across the United States and Canada.

If you're even a bit interested in car culture, chances are high that you heard about manga (in simple words – Japanese comic books/graphic novels) or anime (in simple words – Japanese cartoons) called Initial D (頭文字D). Manga series was written and illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno while pioneer drifter Keiichi Tsuchiya helped with editorial supervision. First issue was released in 1995 and in 2013, after writing 48 volumes, story was complete. Main character is Takumi Fujiwara, young 18 year old, who's father asks him to deliver tofu every morning before dawn. Takumi doesn't enjoy it particularly, so he drives as fast as he can, to finish this job fast and get some more sleep before school. He was doing these tofu runs for few years and without understanding it, learned some serious car control on Akina mountain pass.
Story is easy to follow even if you're not that much into cars and did I mention that it's magnificent? Thing is, story involves you more and more with every chapter, you learn more about cars and car control on the same pace as Takumi, fall deeper in love with his father's Toyota ‘Hachi-Roku' AE86 and worry while competition becomes harder and harder.
Fact is, that a huge percentage of car geeks know nothing except Initial D and this is where they lose. I researched deeper into car-related manga and sharing my findings wit you:
Wangan Midnight (湾岸ミッドナイト)
Another famous Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Michiharu Kusunoki. Story is very similar and at the same time different to Initial D. Both novels feature a young passionate driver – in Wangan Midnight it's Akio Asakura, both books lay their story around an old car with big soul – here it's a tuned Datsun “Devil Z” S30 Z and both stories are about racing, but if Initial D was about downhill touge and drifting, Wangan Midnight focuses on top speed racing on a motorway (Shuto Expressway Bayshore Route).
Shakotan Boogie (シャコタン★ブギ)
Shakotan Boogie is the manga that Kusunoki Michiharu created before the infamous Wangan Midnight that I just reviewed. 32 volumes were illustrated between 80s and 90s. Story goes around two friends – Hajime Yamamoto and Hiroshii Watanabe who cruise around in a Toyota Soarer MZ11 while street racing, picking up girls and search for adventures.
Manga is deeply rooted to Shakotan/Zokusha/Bosozoku car culture, but also features American muscle cars, European supercars and bike racing. If I tried to describe this novel in few words, I would say it's about stance car culture in Japan in 80s.
Jigoro Jigorou (痞子次五郎)
Manga about Jigorou Ishikawa is a favourite choice for many car lovers. Started in 2002 by Atsushi Kase and still active, telling a story of wannabe cool guy. Manga is not really about racing, but more about picking up girls with cars, fighting, showing off, just like Fast & Furious.
Wide variety of of car cultures is presented in this book: street racers, lowriders, VIP cars, Hashiriya, Yanki. Common story is presented here as well: main character finds his car at a junkyard and it's a Nissan S13 with a wide bodykit and lambo doors.
Over Rev! (オーバーレブ!)
Over Rev! manga was created by Katsumi Yamaguchi and Team 39 in year 1997. After seven years and 31 volumes story was complete. While it's less known than the manga above, it's still one of the more widely read and long running comics in Japan. It focuses on drifting and feminism – most of the characters are female.
Story follows Ryoko Shino, high school girl, who saw a street race one night: S13 and R32 drifting just in front of her. Driver of S13 was a female and that caught her eye. She is hooked at this very moment and starts to search for her own car. Since she doesn't have a lot of money, she finds a MR2 at a junkyard, where she pays only ¥10,000 ( around $100) because she's cute. Also Ryoko doesn't have a driving licence at this point and acquiring This is an adventure in itself. Through her journey she doesn't only learn car control, but mechanics, independence, graduation, finding work and other life lessons.
There is one important storyline that I missed in Initial D and Wangan Midnight – official car events. Over Rev! has a lot of car meets, track days and drift cups later in the story.
Capeta (カペタ)
Capeta is the manga and anime for those who are interested in motorsport, circuit racing and karting in particular. Manga ran for ten years, from 2003 to 2013. Story starts with a 10 year old Taira Kappeita, young independent boy. His hardworking father tries to look up for the kid and he knows that young Capeta is interested in cars. One day he brings some parts home and builds him a grassroots kart.
Story goes through three parts: Capeta learns to race, Capeta deals with financial difficulties for supporting his team and Capeta moving towards the goal of beating his rival in Formula Stella. Novel is full of karting and racing references that add flesh to the story and are also factual: comments about racing lines, tire usage, slip streaming and general commentary on the world of four-wheel racing.
F (エフ)
F is a classic manga series written and illustrated by Noboru Rokuda about a country boy named Gunma Akagi who fulfils his dream by racing in Formula 1. Gunma's mother dies and he must live with his father, who didn't take care of him before. He's determined to have a racing career and one day he joins a racing team. Ahead of him there are years and years of hard work and practice towards his dream.
SS (エスエス)
As you probably understood from the name, this manga is all about rallying. Gather here Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi Evo fans. Manga was illustrated by Shohei Harumoto who spent three years (2000-2003) on it.
The story is set around Daibutsu, a former rally driver who lives with his wife Kumiko and their son. He's rebuilding his Mitsubishi Starion 4WD, named Jackie, a Group B rally car which was banned at the end of the 1986 season. When the car is ready, he returns to racing by challenging people on the street with his car.
GT Roman series (GTロマン)
This manga is a bit more series, more grown-up, often features imported classic cars, and when I say imported – I mean European and US cars, like BMW 2002, Alfa Romeo 1300 GTA, Mini Cooper, Chevrolet Camaro, etc. Art style is also unique. Illustrated by Nishikaze (real name Katsutaro Nishibori), manga is all about the pleasure of having a car.
Series spreads to few original titles: GT Roman, Garage, Speedster, Sex Machine, Pit Start, Deadend Street, Last Moment, Cross Roads, GT Roman Stradale.
Countach (カウンタック)
This manga is all about exotic supercars. Illustrated by Haruto Umezawa and published from 2004. This story is one of those rare cases, when the main character doesn't find his dream car in a junkyard. Actually this Lamborghini Countach LP400 was gifted to him by a mysterious millionaire.
Hero's girlfriends leaves him for a man who drives a Ferrari 360. Guess who will be the main rival in this novel.
King (キング)
This manga is quite rare. It was created by Keichiro Shinmura in 2002. Main character is a school teacher that drives a Honda CRX with mid-mounted Impreza boxer engine. How cool is that?!
Full Spec (フルスペック)
Manga for Mazda MX-5 fans created by Taro Sekiguchi. 4 kids find an old Eunos Roadster at a junkyard and now they have ten years to fix it, until they are able to drive it. Chinta is a designer, Bunyan- a mechanic and Arata – driver. Also there is Maki-chan who always hangs out with them.
Car Graffiti JK (カーグラフィティJK)
This is a fresh manga from Enoki Sakishima. Story reflects on modern youth, youth that is not very interested in cars. Government lowered the age when one can apply for a licence to 16 years old. While listening to this news on TV a girl names Miki was preparing for her first day in high school.
She was riding her bike to school when suddenly a classic Toyota “Yota-Hachi” Sports 800 passed by. While looking at car Miki didn't notice an open manhole and crashed. She spent her first month of school in hospital and missed all opportunities to apply for social clubs, except one.. a car clubs!
Restore Garage 251 (レストアガレージ251)
Comic from Ryuji Tsugihara is one of my favourites. It doesn't concentrate on racing, rather on restoring classic Japanese cars and with that, passion of their owners. In very first volume Satomi Yumejiro & his grand son restore a Toyota 2000GT, a Hakosuka, a Datsun 510 Wagon, an RX-3 and a Skyline Kenmeri.
From this manga you also learn a lot of stuff, for example, how carburettors work. Throughout the manga you find out so many things about Japanese car history, visit classic car meets and many more. In more recent chapters they also start to express their love for European sportcars.
Zero Angel (対象商品:ゼロ エンジェル)
In 2016 manga creator Kia Asamiya launched a new car racing manga titled Zero Angel. Manga is set in Yokohama, and tells a story on high school student and undefeated driver Aika Misaki. While she works as an idol in kart racing, at nights she's a street racer in her Subaru WRX STi Type S.
She's 19m her hometown is Takasaki Gunma, her height is 160cm, bust 85cm, waist 58cm and hips 84cm. Before she was featured as a character in another manga – My Favourite Carrera.
Kirin (キリン)
Kirin to motorcycle fans is the same as Initial D is to car and drift fans. Legendary manga – “motorcycle rider's bible” written by Shohei Harumoto and tells a story of 38-year-old Kirin who compares bikes to wild animals. Manga became popular because of precise bike and car drawings, moody backgrounds and the whole “battle” atmosphere. Novel starts with the main character racing a Porsche 911 on his Suzuki GSX1100S “Katana”.
Spin off version called Kirin: The Happy Ridder Speedway was started in 2010, while the original was created in 1987. Both novels are about adults who “burn” their life while racing on public roads. They race each other and also they race high performance cars.
Toppu GP (トップウGP)
Kosuke Fujishima brings us the story of Toppu Uno, a Japanese boy who is aiming for MotoGP, Wworld's top motorcycle race. This manga can remind the story of Capeta a lot. It also features obsessively accurate descriptions of mechanical equipment, motorcycles, and cars, since story was cooperated with motorcycle racers from Japan.
My Favourite Carrera (彼女のカレラ)
This story by Kia Asamiya is a dream scenario for many people. 22 year old Reina inherits a 1992 type 964 Porsche 911 Carrera RS. Manga is about living a “car life” – if you don't work hard, you can't maintain them properly. Reina's life with Porsche just started and there will be many rough spots – insurance, maintenance, customising. Life with this classic sports car will take her to a lot of places – club meets and track days are only few of them.
Donten Prism Solar Car (曇天・プリズム・ソーラーカー)
His name is Kaneda Shouta. His father died in a car accident when he was 10. He works at an ironworks run by his uncle. Shouta-kun has to cycle 30km every day on his bicycle, because he hated cars ever since losing his father in the accident.
One day a group of college students arrives to the workshop and bring a beaten up solar car project that was stored away for 8 years. This club is building a solar car to enter in a race, and they're hoping to get Shota to lend them his mechanical expertise. Will they be able to handle Shota's anger and bitterness, and draw him out of his self-imposed isolation?
The New Car Racing Manga by Initial D author Shuichi Shigeno
In april 2017 it was revealed that Shigeno will start a new car related series this summer. The series will take place in the 2020s, when self-driving cars are an everyday sight in Japan. The series will feature a genius driver who goes back to Japan after graduating top of his or her class at a racing school in England.
Can't wait to get more info about it, what about you guys?
The governing body of Italian rugby, the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR) is pushing ahead with its World Cup candidacy. In what is a second attempt at securing Rugby World Cup hosting rights, Italy has listed twelve stadiums spread around the country.
The Central European country hopes to become the first ever European nation too host alone. Since the creation of the Rugby World Cup in 1987 every second tournament has been staged in Europe. England did so in 1991 with France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales all sub-hosting. In 1999 Wales did so with the other four also allocated matches. France 2007 included Scotland and Wales while Wales again hosted matches during England 2015.
The Italy 2023 would thereby be unique for Europe on two fronts. Firstly it would be a first Rugby World Cup hosted by one nation. Secondly it would see Italy host Rugby World Cup fixtures for the first time ever.
The FIR had identified the capital, Rome as the center-piece. Rome is the only city to have two stadiums included in the bid. This follows on an established pattern from prior Rugby World Cups. In 2003 Sydney had two venues, followed by two in Paris in 2007 and two in Auckland in 2011. London then had three in 2015.
Rome's nominated venues are the Stadio Olimpico and the Stadio Flaminio. They are the same two venues to have been used for Six Nations home internationals by the FIR. They have also tended to be used for hosting one November International per year. Los Pumas, for instance, have played in both.
The venues listed in the bid are genuinely nationwide. North of Rome there are seven host venues. They are Bologna, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Padua, Torino and Udine. The south has Bari and Naples in addition to the Stadio Renzo Barbera in Palermo which gives Sicily a host city.
An additional feature is the use of big cities. All expect Padua hosted FIFA World Cup matches in the 1990 tournament. The FIR have nominated Padua in place of Verona, a city which hosted Italy vs Argentina in 2010.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, tweeted a spoof of a WWE-style video of himself body-slamming another person, with the CNN logo superimposed on their head, in an apparent boast of his "defeat" of CNN. The video had apparently first been uploaded to Reddit, an online social media platform that's popular with the so-called Alt-right, four days ago.

CNN responded strongly to Trump's tweet: "It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters.
"Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied when she said the President had never done so. Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladmir Putin, dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill, he is instead involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office. We will keep doing our jobs. He should start doing his."

Trump claimed "the fake and fraudulent" news media say he shouldn't use social media. He defends the practice by saying that social media helped him win the election.
Trump also took a swipe at a favorite target, CNN. He tweeted that he's considering calling the cable news network "Fraud News CNN" instead of "Fake News CNN."

These latest tweets come after CNN was forced to retract a story concerning alleged links between Trump transition team member, Anthony Scaramucci, and Russia. Three journalists who worked on the story resigned following the retraction. In response, Trump wrote a Tuesday morning tweet, "Wow, CNN had to retract big story on 'Russia,' with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!"

The story was posted on the network's website Thursday and was removed, with all links disabled, Friday night. CNN immediately apologized to Scaramucci.
CNN, in initially taking down the story, said it didn't meet its editorial standards. The episode is a damaging blow for a network that Trump has frequently derided as "fake news," and for a story that never even made it onto any of CNN's television networks.
A man convicted of slaying two people and critically injuring a third in a drug house shooting was executed on Tuesday evening by Texas officials, despite evidence that he suffered from mental retardation.
Milton Mathis, 32, was sentenced to death in 1999, three years before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that execution of the mentally retarded violated the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
Intelligence tests, including one given by the Texas Department of Corrections in 2000, measured Mathis's IQ in the low 60s, well below the threshold for mild mental retardation as recognized by almost all states.
In 2005, however, a Texas court rejected his claims of mental impairment, siding with prosecutors who characterized Mathis as a "street smart" criminal whose behavior indicated near-normal intelligence. Federal and state courts declined to overturn the verdict, clearing the way for his execution by lethal injection at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Hunstville. A last-ditch petition by Mathis's attorneys requesting a stay of execution and a review of his case was rejected without comment by the Supreme Court late Tuesday afternoon.
Mathis was pronounced dead at 6:53 p.m.
"The system has failed me," he said in a final statement, according to prison officials.
A spokeswoman for Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican who is weighing a run for the presidency, said the governor could not offer clemency or a reprieve in the case without a positive recommendation from the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which voted on Monday to reject a reprieve for Mr. Mathis. Members of the board are appointed by the governor.
In 2001, Gov. Perry vetoed a bill passed by the Texas legislature banning the execution of the mentally retarded, saying that the state's judicial system already contained adequate protections for such defendants. Supporters of the bill disagreed, pointing to evidence indicating that at least a half-dozen prisoners with mental deficiencies had been executed since 1990.
Since taking office in December 2000, Gov. Perry has overseen more than 230 executions, more than any other U.S governor in modern history. Mathis was the 6th inmate put to death in Texas this year, and the 23rd in the nation.
In an editorial last week in the Dallas Morning News, former Texas governor Mark White (D) called on Perry to authorize a temporary reprieve for Mathis to examine his claims of mental retardation.
"Mathis has suffered from obvious mental disabilities since childhood," wrote White. "He failed the first, fifth and eight grades and dropped out of high school in ninth grade."
"The governor of Texas is authorized by law to take action to prevent precisely this sort of injustice," he wrote.
Fred Felcman, an assistant district attorney for Fort Bend County who led the prosecution of Mathis, disputed White's claims, saying Mathis's mental deficits were not severe enough to disqualify him from the death penalty.
"We don't execute people who are mentally retarded," Felcman said. "The guy is street smart."
Felcman attended the execution in Huntsville at the request of Melanie Almaguer, he said, who was paralyzed from the chest down at age 15 after being shot in the face by Mathis.
Steven Rocket Rosen, who defended Mathis in his original trial, said there was "no excuse" for the actions of his client. But he said Mathis's mental problems were severe and had been aggravated by heavy drug use from a young age.
According to court records, Mathis began smoking PCP and marijuana soaked in formaldehyde, known as "fry," as early as age 12.
Welcome to FP Magazine's latest ranking for Canada's largest corporations by revenue. Our research includes public firms, private companies, subsidiaries and Crown corporations, making the FP500 the most authoritative survey of Canadian business available.
Total revenue recorded by FP500 corporations in the last fiscal year was $1.88 trillion, down $112 billion from the year before, and the average reported revenue was $3.76 billion, down from $4 billion. The average profit of the 397 companies that reported such figures was $171.5 million, with 118 companies, or 29.7% of those reporting, recording a loss.
The average value of assets for the 426 companies that reported them was $23.8 billion. Co-operators Group Ltd. (No. 117) is pretty representative of the average. The property insurer had revenue of about $3.6 billion, a $156.9-million profit and assets of $13.5 billion.
The FP500 revenue cutoff line this year is $378.6 million, well off the $448.1 million required to make the grade last year. Points International Ltd., a Toronto-based loyalty program services provider that was incorporated in 1999, is No. 500, moving up 109 spots from last year.
There are 283 publicly traded companies on the FP500, of which 272 trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and one — Pivot Technology Solutions Inc. — on the Venture. Five companies solely trade on the New York Stock Exchange, four on the Nasdaq and one — CHC Group Ltd. — on the pink sheets. There were 83 cross-listed TSX companies, including 62 on the NYSE, 17 on the Nasdaq and four on the NYSE MKT. The rest of the FP500 includes 161 private companies, 44 Crown corporations and 12 co-ops.
George Weston Ltd. (No. 1) is the country's biggest employer for the second year in a row. The food giant that encompasses Loblaw Cos. Ltd. and Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. has 202,400 employees, 1,600 more than last year. Onex Corp. (No. 13), the second-largest employer, has 144,000 workers, 48,000 fewer than last year. The smallest employer was gold streamer Franco-Nevada Corp. with 29 workers driving $566.9 million in revenue, which works out to $19.5 million per employee.
The biggest Mover
The biggest mover in the FP500 database was Concordia Healthcare Corp., which climbed 329 spots to land at No. 445. That might surprise those who expected the company, which was once happy to be called a mini version of troubled Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., would have been dinged by all the bad news that has faced the latter. Although both companies' share prices have tanked — Concordia was down 53.4% over the past year as of April 25, while Valeant was off 81.3% — Concordia's revenue increased 334.5% to $503.8 million thanks to a couple of billion-dollar-plus acquisitions. Valeant's numbers were unknown since its issues forced it to delay its year-end reporting by several months. Rounding out the top five gainers on the FP500 were Restaurant Brands International Inc., Element Financial Corp., OpenRoad Auto Group Ltd. and HudBay Minerals Inc.
The Biggest Decline
The biggest decliner within the FP500 ranking is Lacombe, Alta.-based Agriculture Financial Services Corp., which dropped 154 spots to No. 467. The Alberta government-funded agency that lends to farmers and small businesses and manages the province's crop insurance had a tough year. Payouts to farmers adversely affected by weather conditions in 2015 hit $506.2 million as of April 1, 2016, with 5% of the post-harvest inspections still to be completed. The agency's executives, as well those at other Alberta agencies, were also criticized for their high salaries, leading to new legislation that puts the names of anyone at those agencies who makes $125,000 or more on the published annual sunshine list. The four other biggest drops were by Pengrowth Energy Corp., Lightstream Resources Ltd., Trican Well Service Ltd. and Harvest Operations Corp., all based in Calgary. The biggest fall out of the FP500 was by Western Energy Services Corp., also of Calgary, which fell 163 spots to land at No. 623.
The biggest profit
The highest profit recorded by any corporation on the FP500 was $20.1 billion and it was by a Crown corporation, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which manages several provincial public and parapublic pension plans and insurance programs. But it was far from the only government-run corporation to turn a profit. The average Crown corporation made about $3.2 billion in revenue and turned a profit of roughly $1.1 billion. The only three of the 41 on this list to lose money were the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Nalcor Energy (Newfoundland and Labrador's energy corporation) and Metrolinx, the Ontario agency that handles public transportation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area corridor.
The Newcomers
There are 16 newcomers on the FP500 with Hydro One Ltd. being the highest entrant at No. 69. It arrives via an IPO that generated $1.66 billion for the Ontario government, which sold 13.6% of its stake in the electrical utility that serves the province, at $20.50 a share, making it the biggest IPO in Canada in 15 years. In April, the province sold another big chunk at $23.65 per share to raise approximately $1.71 billion. The take-up on both deals was very healthy given the criticism of the provincial grid. The Ontario auditor general in December reported that Ontarians have paid $37 billion above market rates over the past eight years due to mismanagement and Hydro One's distribution system was singled out for being the country's least reliable large Canadian electricity distributor. Some of the other notable newcomers include Google Canada Inc. (No. 95), Bruce Power Ltd. Partnership (No. 132), FirstService Corp. (No. 225) and Pivot Technology Solutions Inc. (No. 238).
More than a Double Double
Like the Bloody Caesar, a double-double coffee is a uniquely Canadian drink that disgusts most others, but Tim Hortons sells a lot of them and that explains the rise of Restaurant Brands International Inc., which posted a 290.9% jump in revenue to $5.2 billion. The reason: its results include a full year of revenue from Tim Hortons, which was merged with Burger King in a $12.5-billion deal to create a fast-food behemoth. Last year's results only included three weeks of Tim Hortons' revenues since the deal closed Dec. 12, 2014. It's worth noting that the combined company is officially headquartered in Oakville, Ont., to take advantage of Canada's more favourable corporate tax environment, allowing Tim Hortons fans to still claim it as a Canadian icon.
As for that other one-time Canadian icon, BlackBerry Ltd., it continued its slide since 2010, falling 33 spots to No. 149 by posting a 24.9% drop in revenue to $2.8 billion. Even those without long memories should be able to recall when the company, then called Research In Motion Ltd., was Canada's 13th largest company. It was only six years ago and the company had more than seven times its current revenue.

Guide to using the FP500
COMPANIES LISTED Canadian and worldwide operations of companies incorporated or based in Canada.
RANK Companies are generally ranked on a descending basis by revenue. Some supplementary tables are ranked by other factors, such as profit. The ranking category is always highlighted.
HEAD OFFICE locations are listed beside company names.
FISCAL YEAR END A company's fiscal year end, if not December 2015, is noted next to the head office location.
INDUSTRIES Industry codes for companies in the FP500, Subsidiaries, Financials and Crown corporation rankings are listed in each table. The key to industry codes is listed below.
N.A. This abbreviation, used throughout the listings, means not available or not applicable.
REVENUE Includes goods, services and rental revenues. Excluded are non-operating revenues (e.g., dividends, interest, equity income). Excise taxes and royalty payments applicable to mining and oil and gas companies, distillers and tobacco manufacturers are also excluded. For banks, credit unions, trust companies and other investment companies, revenue consists of interest, investment income and other operating revenue. Insurance company revenue comprises premium and investment income.
PROFIT Net income attributable to equity holders where applicable.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Per basic common share or equivalent as reported by the company and adjusted for share splits and consolidations.
RESTATED RESULTS Previous year's rankings are not restated. However, percentage changes in revenue, assets and profit when applicable are based on restated figures.
PROFIT (LOSS) AS % OF REVENUE Profit (loss) for the fiscal year as a percentage of revenue.
PROFIT (LOSS) AS % OF ASSETS Profit (loss) for the fiscal year as a percentage of average assets at the latest two fiscal year ends.
PROFIT (LOSS) AS % OF EQUITY Profit (loss) for the fiscal year as a percentage of the average shareholders' equity at the latest two year ends.
FIVE-YEAR PROFIT % GROWTH Percentage change from the profit (loss) reported in the fiscal year five years prior to the profit (loss) reported in this year's FP500. Generally, this is fiscal 2010.
SHARE-PRICE CHANGE Percentage change in the company's share price for the one and five years ended April 22, 2016. Share-price changes for companies only listed in the U.S. are based on Canadian-dollar equivalents.
FIVE-YEAR REVENUE % GROWTH Percentage change from the revenue reported in the fiscal year five years prior to the revenue reported in this year's FP500. Generally, this is fiscal 2010.
MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS Individuals or organizations with a voting interest of 10% or more. Where space permits, the two largest shareholders are listed. Status is updated through April 22, 2016.
FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Percentage of registered foreign ownership of voting interests is shown if it is 10% or more. If no foreign country is indicated, the ownership is Canadian.
TICKER The company's stock symbol on Canadian or American stock exchanges. Where a company has multiple stocks, the primary Canadian stock is used. If the company isn't listed on an exchange, the following symbols are used: (Priv) = Private; (Coop) = Co-operative; (Crn) = Crown. Crown companies are defined by type of incorporation,
not ownership. Consequently, companies such as Toronto Hydro Corp. are classified as (Priv) rather than (Crn).
EXCHANGE LISTINGS Only stock exchanges in Canada and the U.S. are noted. The following symbols are used to identify stock exchanges: T = TSX; V = TSX Venture Exchange; N = New York; Q = Nasdaq; A = NYSE MKT; OTC = Over the Counter.
CURRENCY CONVERSION U.S. dollars are converted into Canadian dollars. The average rate for the company's fiscal year is used to convert income-statement items (e.g., revenue, profit) and the closing rate is used to convert balance-sheet items (e.g., assets, shareholders' equity).
DOUBLE COUNTING on the FP500 is avoided by excluding subsidiaries whose accounts are consolidated with those of the parent company (except the Market Capitalization list). For example, Loblaw Cos. Ltd.'s results are consolidated with those of George Weston Ltd. However, Loblaw is listed separately in the subsidiaries table.
MULTIPLE LISTINGS Companies, other than subsidiaries, are shown first on the FP500 listings and then on other appropriate lists. For example, Insurance Corp. of British Columbia is on the FP500 list and, because it is a Crown corporation engaged in property and casualty insurance, also on the Crown Corporations and the Insurers: Property and Casualty lists. Likewise, a subsidiary may appear on other appropriate lists, but only if its parent is not shown on the same list.
New Open City Site Lets You Know When Sewage Is Being Dumped Into The Chicago River

A new site from the creators of Open City, Is There Sewage In The Chicago River, lets Chicago residents know when sewage is being dumped into the Chicago river. It happens more often than you think.
Specifically, it's happened almost 450 times since January 1, 2007. That's raw, untreated sewage being dumped into the Chicago river. Which naturally raises the question of how this sewage-dumping can be allowed in the first place--a question the site thoroughly answers.
Basically, the site explains "Chicagoland water management companies dump excess wastewater...in order to prevent flooding." So, in order to prevent Chicago citizens from sitting in sewage, they dump it into the rivers and lakes. In order to prevent the sewage from contaminating the drinking supply, the city reversed the flow of the Chicago river.
Subsequently, what Is There Sewage describes as "nutrient pollution" travels to the Gulf of Mexico, where it sits in "a dead zone roughly the size of New Hampshire."
Yikes.
Back in the '70s, the Metropolitan Reclamation District of Greater Chicago started building a massive tunnel in order to prevent flooding. It's not scheduled to be completed until 2029. Despite the state of Illinois adopting water quality standards to be implemented in three years' time, the Reclamation District will still dump sewage in the river.
And that's why and where Is There Sewage In Our Rivers comes in. The site notes that they are a work in progress, so, if you have any suggestions, drop them a line. Otherwise? Just keep refreshing. Lord knows the river isn't.

In a world that requires increasing amounts of compute power to handle the resource-intensive demands of workloads like artificial intelligence and machine learning, IBM enters the fray with its latest generation Power chip, the Power9.
The company intends to sell the chips to third-party manufacturers and to cloud vendors including Google. Meanwhile, it's releasing a new computer powered by the Power9 chip, the AC922 and it intends to offer the chips in a service on the IBM cloud. “We generally take our technology to market as a complete solution,” Brad McCredie, IBM fellow and vice president of cognitive systems explained.
The company has designed the new chip specifically to improve performance on common AI frameworks like Chainer, TensorFlow and Caffe, and claims an increase for workloads running on these frameworks by up to almost 4x.
If it works as described this should give data scientists building models and running them on a Power9-powered machine increased speed, which should allow them to run these jobs faster and complete model creation more quickly.
Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy believes IBM has really differentiated itself from the competition with this chip. “Power9 is a chip which has a new systems architecture that is optimized for accelerators used in machine learning. Intel makes Xeon CPUs and Nervana accelerators and NVIDIA makes Tesla accelerators. IBM's Power9 is literally the Swiss Army knife of ML acceleration as it supports an astronomical amount of IO and bandwidth, 10X of anything that's out there today,” Moorhead said.
If you're thinking that Nvidia seems to have grabbed a good deal of the AI/machine learning workloads, it didn't escape IBM's notice either and they have been working closely with the GPU chipmaker. In fact, McCredie says that IBM built a system bus that moves workloads between the two chip types much faster than competitive systems.
“Modern workloads are becoming accelerated and the Nvidia GPU is a common accelerator. We have seen this trend coming. We built a deep relationship with them and a partnership between the Power system and the GPU. We have a unique bus that runs between the processor and the GPU and has 10x peak bandwidth over competitive systems,” McCredie explained.
The new chips are going to power a supercomputer called Summit being built by Lawrence Livermore and Oakridge national laboratories. He says the supercomputer will be built on top of thousands and thousands of the Power9 computers at a cost of $325 million, a nice little burst of business for the new chip right out of the gate.
Chirag Dekate, who is research director for HPC, machine learning and emerging compute technologies at Gartner says this release is a continuation of IBM's aggressive approach to capture high-growth market segments like artificial intelligence. “By aligning their strategy across segments like AI (specifically machine learning and deep learning), it enables IBM to better compete in hyperscale datacenter and broader market datacenter initiatives. This has a potential to drive direct revenue impact for IBM and enable new larger scale datacenter deployments,” Dekate explained.
The Power9 chip is generally available starting today.
Global food prices reached a historic high in February of this year, surpassing the spikes of 2007-2008. Food riots have occurred in Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, and now the Horn of Africa region is on the brink of disaster. This situation has hunger experts on edge. While bad weather is part of problem, high energy prices, increasing use of grain for biofuels, and export restrictions are also contributing to the situation. Our understanding
of the 2008 global food crisis is now informing our reaction to the current situation. Unfortunately, the wrong lessons are being drawn from that experience.
It was just three short years ago that the world was wracked by a series of riots touched off by high food prices that had increased steadily since 2000, and by 50% between 2007 and 2008. While longer term causes were at play in 2008, such as urbanization and changing diets, short term factors were more significant in the immediate run-up to the crisis.
Increasing fuel prices were critical because of the energy intensive nature of most agriculture production. Higher energy prices also made ethanol production more competitive at the time, an industry which used 25% of the US maize crop in 2008 and further contributed to higher grain prices. The other short term drivers of the 2007-2008 situation were speculation in the grain markets and a series of government decisions around the world to restrict grain trade.
In tandem with the current advice to maintain unrestricted grain trade are international assistance efforts since 2008 to disseminate technologies that allow countries to increase their own food production. International agencies are seeking to boost food production through the increasing use of packages of hybrid seeds, pesticides and fertilizers.
Research undertaken by colleagues and I in three West African countries in the aftermath of the 2008 global food crisis suggests that the current policy recommendations are flawed (http://www.macalester.edu/whatshappening/press/2010/ February19asianrice.html).
While restrictions on grain trade clearly pose problems in the short term, pushing for unrestricted grain trade also perpetuates a reliance on imported food. Our study showed that a combination of increasingly cheap rice on the global market, reduced investments in local agriculture, and the dismantling of tariff barriers by West African countries in the 1980s and 1990s (at the behest of the World Bank), had a devastating effect on local rice
producers. By 2008, a region historically known for its rice production was dependent on imports for 40% of its consumption. This free trade approach worked as long as global food prices remained relatively low, but food riots ensued when the price for rice increased by 100% between April, 2007 and March, 2008.
It was the West African country with the most robust domestic rice and coarse grainsectors, Mali, which faired the best in 2008. While the World Bank convinced Mali, like its coastal neighbors, to remove barriers to the grain trade in previous decades, it could not undo the fact that Mali is land locked, making imported grains that much more expensive. It is this country's land locked nature, a type of natural trade barrier if you will, which allowed its domestic farming sector to prosper and the country to weather the food price fluctuations of 2007-2008.
Since 2008, international advisors have been busy across West Africa encouraging governments to boost production by planting NERICA rice. This hybrid of Asian and African rice varieties is the latest silver bullet purported to solve West Africa's food problems. The trouble is that NERICA rice requires farmers who have the financial resources to purchase the seeds, fertilizers and pesticides to grow this crop – inputs which will only become more expensive when global energy prices rise again. It is the poorest of the poor who are hungry in West Africa, not relatively wealthy farmers who can afford to grow NERICA rice. Further complications include efforts to have men grow this crop when women are the traditional rice farmers, or the fact that NERICA rice often displaces other crops which are more ecologically appropriate and require fewer inputs.
As we react to the rising grain prices of 2011, let us make sure we correctly understand the lessons of 2008.
First, there are limits to the free market in terms of its ability to deliver food security to the world's poorest households. As such, some level of tariff protection may be needed if countries are to develop stronger national food systems.
Second, increasing food production via improved seeds packages doesn't really solve the problem either, especially when this approach favors rich over poor farmers, men over women, or certain types of food crops over others. We have yet to fully explore the potential for expanded food production by low tech approaches that are attuned to local conditions.

The archbishop of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil has had his crucifix and ring stolen in an armed robbery.
Cardinal Dom Orani Tempesta was on his way to an engagement in the city when his car was ambushed by three men.
One of the robbers, who pointed a gun at the cardinal, realised who he was and apologised, an aide said.
However, the gang continued with the crime only holding back from taking his vehicle as well. The cardinal's items were later recovered.
No-one was hurt in the incident, which happened on Monday evening in the Santa Teresa district of the city.
The BBC's Gary Duffy in São Paulo says robberies are common in Santa Teresa - a bohemian area popular with tourists - and have been increasing this year.
A seminary student and a photographer travelling in the car with the cardinal were also robbed.
Despite the ordeal, the cardinal continued on to his engagement while the student and the photographer went to the police.
Brazil's TV Globo says that the thieves abandoned most of the stolen property, which was later recovered.
The ring and the cross were found, as were the archbishop's mobile phone and the seminarian's cassock.
However, the photographer's equipment is still missing.
Dom Orani Tempesta was made a cardinal by Pope Francis earlier this year.
The sculptor behind the “Charging Bull” statue near Wall Street in New York said on Wednesday that the “Fearless Girl” sculpture placed in front of his artwork is a violation of his rights, changing its meaning and context.
With his attorney steadying him at the lectern, Italian-born Arturo Di Modica was visibly emotional as he explained that his work, installed in 1989, was meant to symbolize “freedom, world peace, strength, power and love”.
The 'Fearless Girl' statue sums up what's wrong with feminism today | Cara Marsh Sheffler Read more
Now, he says, thanks to the March installation of a bronze statue of a girl facing down the bull, that message has been transformed into one of negativity and fear.
“The Charging Bull no longer carries a positive, optimistic message. Rather, it has been transformed into a negative force and a threat,” said Di Modica's attorney, Norman Siegel. “Clearly, a deliberate choice was made to exploit and to appropriate the ‘Charging Bull' through the placement of the ‘Fearless Girl'.”
Siegel and Di Modica have asked the city of New York to remove the statue, which became something of a phenomenon when it was first installed earlier this year, and tied by many to the global Women's March movement. They say the city should place the “Fearless Girl” somewhere else where it no longer relies on the “Charging Bull”. “The work is incomplete without Mr Di Modica's Charging Bull, and as such it constitutes a derivative work,” Seigel said, noting that the statue of the girl, hands on her hips, only becomes “fearless” because of the much larger, aggressive bull.
Siegel pointed to a 1990 copyright statute that grants visual artists the right “to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation or other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to [the artist's] reputation”.
In addition to the removal of the statue, Di Modica was seeking unspecified damages from the city of New York. Siegel said, however, that his client had not filed a lawsuit yet and is hoping the city – specifically its mayor, Bill de Blasio – will come to the table with the artist in good faith. De Blasio recently extended “Fearless Girl's” permit through March 2018 and has called it a symbol of “standing up to fear, standing up to power” and doing what's right. Seigel said the “inescapable implication” was that Di Modica's bull became “a force against doing what's right”.
The installation was made by the financial firm State Street Global Advisors, and was initially accompanied by a plaque that read: ‘‘Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.'' The “SHE” in this case refers to an exchange-traded fund offered by SSGA, which Di Modica's supporters say makes the piece an advertisement, and one that fully relies on tarnishing the Charging Bull. The fund was developed by SSGA to track companies with greater levels of gender diversity in senior leadership roles.
“This is absolutely a commercial,” said Arthur Piccolo, the Chairman of the Bowling Green Association – the area where the bull and, now, the little girl both reside. Piccolo said executives in the advertising industry are calling it one of the greatest ads of all time. “It's a story that went around the world,” he added.
But the “Fearless Girl's” popularity doesn't change Di Modica's rights in the scenario Siegel said. “Principle trumps popularity, and there are principles here. The fact that people want gender diversity and equality, great. But you've got to put that in the context of certain rights. If we get to the point or forgetting those basic principles, we're out in never-never land.”
(CNN) A senator's claim that the White House's chief economic adviser faked a bad connection to get President Donald Trump off the phone during a long call drew immediate pushback Wednesday from the White House and multiple people in the room.
Sen. Tom Carper made the claim Wednesday morning during an interview with CNN that chief economic adviser Gary Cohn abruptly ended a conversation about tax reform that the President had called into while he was traveling in Asia earlier in November.
The Delaware Democrat said that he had been meeting with Cohn, White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short and other members of the Trump administration, as well as moderate Democrats, when the President called in from his Asia trip.
Carper noted that it was "nice of him" to call, but claimed that "15 minutes later, the President (was) still talking."
"I said, 'Gary, why don't you do this, just take the phone from, you know, your cell phone back and just say, 'Mr. President, you're brilliant, but we're losing contact, and I think we're going to lose you now, so good-bye,' " the lawmaker recounted on "CNN Newsroom" with Poppy Harlow and John Berman.

Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. took to Twitter Wednesday morning to tell his 24,000 followers that the “senseless” murder of Christopher Lane by three black teenagers in Oklahoma is “frowned upon.”
“Praying for the family of Chris Lane. This senseless violence is frowned upon and the justice system must prevail,” Mr. Jackson said.
Mr. Lane, a 23-year-old native of Australia, was visiting the town of Duncan where his girlfriend and her family live, when he was gunned down by three young men who said they were “bored.”
“They saw Christopher go by, and one of them said: ‘There's our target,'” Police Chief Danny Ford said Monday “The boy who has talked to us said, ‘We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody.'”
Laura Ingraham, Allen West and others have wondered if Mr. Jackson would be taking action in this case, since he so vigorously supported Trayvon Martin.
After his comments today, though, it doesn't seem Twitter users are buying his condolences.
“frowned upon? FROWNED UPON?!! Use all the vigor of your outrage to help stop this violence! Not frown upon it!!!” one person commented.
“But I guess you aren't ‘Outraged' and won't be marching over it huh?” another asked.
Another said, “Thanks for that tepid, milquetoast response. ‘Frowned upon'?? Why not be REALLY harsh and call the boys ‘naughty' or ‘fresh'?”
About an hour later, Mr. Jackson went back to bashing conservatives.

ORLANDO, Fla. (March 17, 2017) - Orlando City SC waives forward Bryan Róchez, opening a Designated Player spot on the roster. Recently acquired attacker Giles Barnes will now occupy a Designated Player spot.
Rochez is claimed by Atlanta United off of waivers, carrying a Reserve Minimum Salary Charge for the expansion side. Orlando City SC will retain the rest of his 2017 budget charge.
Barnes joined the Lions on Feb. 25 via trade with Vancouver Whitecaps FC. The Jamaica national team star entered the Lions season opener in the 11th minute and earned the game-winning assist on his first touch - a lofted cross to the back post for Cyle Larin. Since joining MLS in 2012, Barnes has 33 goals and 16 assists in 132 regular and postseason appearances.
Róchez originally joined the Lions in December 2014 from Real C.D. España in the Honduras Primera División. In 2015, he scored three goals in 16 substitute appearances for the Lions. Rochez spent the beginning of 2016 on loan with Orlando City B in the United Soccer League. The Tegucigalpa, Honduras, native was then loaned to Real C.D. España for the remainder of the season.
Orlando will retain a percentage of any future transfer fee if the player is transferred outside of the league by Atlanta United.

New rules will be introduced into Formula 1 in a bid to make racing fairer for taller and heavier drivers.
From 2015, the minimum combined weight of car and driver will be raised by 10kg to 701kg.
With teams struggling to keep the weight down on their cars as a result of heavier turbo engines, larger drivers may be at a disadvantage.
Weight is a key performance issue in F1, with 10kg equating to about 0.3secs per lap.
Attempts to adopt the rule for 2014 were blocked last year by some teams.
Meanwhile, the FIA, which governs F1, has once again said it intends to impose measures that limit the amount teams can spend from 2015.
The cost-capping move, agreed by the FIA, F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and the teams, is designed to "assure a healthy, affordable and spectacular" championship for the "long-term future".
The FIA will also outlaw tyre warmers from 2015.
Previous attempts to ban them foundered due to safety concerns, with drivers worried about racing on cold tyres.
My recent letter to Canadian politicians has received much attention, much more than I had anticipated. It is definitely a holiday that we won't be forgetting in a hurry!
That letter began: “My girlfriend and I (Danish) were tourists in your country for five weeks this summer. We had the most incredible adventure and met the most wonderful Canadians, who welcomed us warmly into their homes. Apart from these people, who sincerely do your nation credit, our overwhelming memory of Canada is one of cars, traffic, parking and the related obesity and unfulfilled communities.”
The overwhelming number of comments and responses have been positive. It is understandable that many comments are defensive in nature. I don't think it was emphasized enough what a wonderful time we had in Canada, especially hiking and canoeing through the beautiful national parks. The letter, directed to politicians, laments car culture in general rather than Canada as a country. As such, I hope that any energy my letter has inspired, regardless of the perspective, will be directed towards urban planners, local leaders and ministers rather than comment sites.
Living streets and sustainable communities are issues that I feel strongly about both at home and abroad. The letter was not a comparison with any other country, but yes, I do believe that looking outside of the box and sharing good practice is a way for cities across the world to grow sustainably.
A few points have arisen as a result of this discussion, largely in defence of “car culture.” I'd like to address them if I may:
We love our cars!
That's great. What is important, though, is having choices, and safe, affordable and convenient choices. Cars should not be the only option. In a sustainable, livable city, a citizen should have a choice to walk, cycle, run, take the bus, ride the train, get a lift with a friend or drive. These choices must be open to everybody old, young, able bodied and disabled. It is possible to have it all, and the option of driving a car should be alongside, rather than at the expense of healthier, quicker and often more affordable options.
Country X is too big for sustainable transport
Density and sprawl are more relevant to the discussion than size. Many people live within 5 to 15 km of where they work, shop and play but infrastructure designed exclusively for private cars makes sustainable and healthy travel options difficult. In regards to inter-city travel, driving for lengthy periods is unsafe and time consuming. Large countries in particular should demand superb transport systems between cities to make travel safer, cheaper and more relaxing.
What about winter?
Agreed. Winter in Scandinavia is pretty dismal, especially for vulnerable groups in society. I'm sure parts of Canada are even worse. Again, it is about providing choices for safe travel, not just cars. Gridlock is gridlock in sun and snow. Car-free bus lanes, trains, cleared bicycle and pedestrian lanes alongside traffic-calmed roads can make winter transport safer and more convenient for everybody. The same is true of choices for the remaining three seasons.
Amid the responses to this discussion I genuinely hope that energies are directed towards those who can actually change policy. Hopefully less gridlock, safe and sustainable choices, green spaces and livable, vibrant, healthy communities are what people want all over the world. Sustainable transport is about giving people safe choices to travel, not banning cars.

Police used water cannon in an effort to disperse crowds demonstrating the start of the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 6 after clashes between protesters and police. Heavy security was present from the outset of the protest as police warned protesters the rally would not go ahead unless individuals removed masks covering their faces. These videos show the police presence on the streets of Hamburg's Fischmarkt neighborhood. Police later confronted marchers at that location, using water cannon and handheld sprays to disperse protesters. Credit: Instagram/loislane2020 via Storyful
White House aides were so worried about Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's G20 meeting running long that they sent First Lady Melania Trump in to try to break it up, it has been revealed.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that after initially disagreeing on Russia's meddling in the US election, the American and Russian leaders had a very positive meeting that stretched way past its scheduled half-hour length.
The two presidents had such a “positive chemistry” that once they started talking “neither one of the wanted to stop”, Mr Tillerson said.
Fearing that Mr Trump would be late for his next appointment, the official concert at the Group of 20 summits in Hamburg, Germany, White House aides had to get creative.
So, when the meeting reached the one-hour mark, they sent in First Lady Melania Trump to see her husband and “get him out”, Mr Tillerson said.
“Clearly she failed,” he said, because the gabfest lasted for another hour and 15 minutes.
Mrs Trump was stuck inside her accommodation in Hamburg for much of Friday due to violent protests outside the venue.
She finally appeared at the official concert on Friday evening with Mr Trump after having been holed up in the Senate Guest House.
She was due to go on a river cruise hosted by Chancellor Angela Merkel's husband but her spokesman said “we have not received the all-clear from police to leave the residence.”
Mrs Trump tweeted that she hoped people “stayed safe” as police urgently requested back up due to “many crimes” being committed in the city.
Thinking of those hurt in #Hamburg protests. Hope everyone stays safe! #G20 — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) July 7, 2017
The huge summit has been marred by violent protests that have virtually shut down parts of the city. On Friday morning President Trump was forced to take a detour after a sit-in protest blocked his motorcade.
Hamburg police said a helicopter was nearly struck by a flare set off by protesters. Another pilot received eye injuries after a laser was directed at them.
Meanwhile Hamburg's police department said 11 people were badly injured and taken to hospital after falling off a wall during a confrontation with police.

Clashes are expected to continue over the weekend. So far 70 people have been arrested and more than 100 police injured, with cars, bins and pallets set on fire.
More than 100,000 protesters are expected to attend the event over the weekend. On Friday the spouse group, led by Chancellor Merkel's husband was forced to rearrange their plans due to protests, with some online hailing it as a success the US First Lady had been forced to remain at home.
Residents tweeted pictures of cars in flames. Elsewhere “Black Bloc” protesters could be seen marching down the streets.

It follows a violent night on Thursday where police used water cannons and tear gas after around 1000 anarchists from the far-left Black Bloc refused to remove their face coverings.
Protesters threw rocks and bottles and Hamburg police said they were “appalled” at what had happened.
The cars of a tyre belonging to a member of the Canadian delegation were slashed while windows at the consulate of Mongolia were smashed on Thursday night.

In February, 2009, the US Department of Justice announced that it would no longer raid medical marijuana dispensaries that abided by state laws, sparking a boom in quasi-legal cannabis investments that I detail today in “Joint Ventures” (my feature from the January/February print magazine that's now online). Even so, the fast-growing grey-market in ganja could be about to get pruned. The Internal Revenue Service is reportedly auditing some of California's largest and most reputable medical pot dispensaries, examining their compliance with an obscure section of tax law aimed at drug dealers. Dispensary owners say that the provision, if strictly applied, could effectively snuff out the nation's burgeoning medical marijuana industry.
Enacted in 1982, the year that President Ronald Reagan declared a “War on Drugs,” section 280E of the federal tax code explicitly bans any tax deductions related to “trafficking in controlled substances.” Though 280E predated the legalization of medical marijuana in California and other states, it has remained “like a dagger held at the throat of every medical cannabis organization,” says Steve D'Angelo, the founder of Oakland's Harborside Health Center, which recently underwent an audit by the IRS that targeted its compliance with the provision. “If 280E is applied literally and strictly, it has the potential to close down Harborside and every other medical cannabis dispensary.”
According to Americans for Safe Access, a nonprofit group that advocates on behalf of medical marijuana users and growers, the IRS has recently launched audits of several other large dispensaries in California based on 280E. (The IRS did not return a phone call last week). “I think it's a new front [in the War on Drugs],” says Caren Woodson, the ASA's director of government affairs. “We're nervous that this is going to have a big effect.”
In recent years, dispensary owners had assumed that problems with 280E were behind them. In 2005, the IRS audited the San Francisco dispensary Californians Helping to Alleviate Medical Problems (CHAMP), which successfully argued in court that 280E should apply only to a small fraction of its business that dealt directly with the sale of marijuana. CHAMP primarily served terminally ill AIDS patients and argued that most of its resources went towards counseling and other “caregiving services.”
Of course, as marijuana in California has become “medicine” for just about anyone who be illin, the IRS may be aiming to narrow the CHAMP loophole. Whether the tax men don't like pot shops or just want a bigger chunk of their revenues—an estimated $1.3 billion last year in California alone—is anyone's guess. D'Angelo hopes that the IRS is getting involved “because in good faith they want to treat us like legitimate members of the community who should pay our fair share of taxes.”
But just to be safe, he's ramping up an anti-280E lobbying effort through the new, DC-based National Cannabis Industries Association (“The national voice for the cannabis industry”). California Congressman Pete Stark, a Bay Area Democrat who helped pass the original 280E, may sponsor a bill that would exempt medical pot dispensaries from the law. Ultimately, today's medical pot retailers may be too big, pervasive, and powerful to stand for being taxed out of business.
Yet the same isn't true for other parts of the “cannabusiness.” Medical marijuana growers might have a harder time plausibly deducting expenses for yoga classes, acupuncture sessions, and naturopath consultations (all services at Harborside). Specifically, 280E could be a huge pain in the ass of pot growers who are coming out of the shadows to bid on one of the four industrial-scale permits being offered (or maybe not being offered) by the City of Oakland. Which is why Oakland businessmen Dhar Mann and Derek Peterson, the “ganjapreneurs” who I profile in “Joint Ventures,” are so interesting. Despite the obvious risks, these guys aim to be their generation's “Warren Puff-its.” Whether they suceed or fail, it will certainly be fun to watch.

Muse might be known for their synthy choruses, but until now, their signature sound has been created in a recording studio—on Earth.
But if the band's frontman Matt Bellamy has his wishes come true, the group's next record will contain otherwordly sounds that are actually from space.
In a recent interview with Contact Music, the singer says, “We're trying to blag a free trip on it [Virgin Galactic]. I'm going to try to convince Richard Branson to let us make a music video or record a song up there. I think that would be cool. Would I be scared? I think I'll be alright.”
After playing a show in Moscow, Bellamy, who has always held an interest in astronomy, received a telescope which sparked his newest beyond-earth venture, “The crowd in Moscow were probably the most intense we've ever had. They were going mental and they bought me a big telescope. It's a big, real, serious piece. I set it up when I got home and looked at the moon. Fucking hell, have you ever looked at the moon through a telescope? It's all mountains and stuff, it's unbelievable.”
No word yet on when and if the top-grossing rockers will make their dream voyage.
St Bees Head, Cumbria The red sandstone cliffs are home to a reserve that claims to be the largest seabird colony in the north-west
At Cumbria's most westerly point, I watch two fulmars glide stiff-winged on the wind over the unmanned lighthouse. Guillemots follow suit, as does a razorbill (inappropriately named, for, though similar, their beaks are blunter and thicker). The adjacent red sandstone cliffs, 300ft high, are home to an RSPB bird reserve that claims to be the largest seabird colony in north-west England.
B-o-o-om! “What was that?” asks a startled woman, one of a group tackling Wainwright's Coast-to-Coast walk. “It's not the foghorn,” says another walker, consulting a guidebook. “Says here it has long been decommissioned. Maybe it's wind hitting the cliffs.” She reads from the book: “Wreckers once lured ships below the headland with lanterns, then plundered the wreckage.” They stride on towards Robin Hood's Bay 14 days and 190-odd miles to the east.
With two friends I descend the sloping pasture to a fence above an Irish Sea as dimpled as bubble-wrap. At a sign reading “Dangerous cliff” I leave them to it: “The Fishermen's Steps drop down from here. Good luck taking the photos.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sandwith lighthouse, St Bees Head. Photograph: Tony Greenbank
Three sea anglers with rods and bags arrive on top. “Watch it down there,” they shout as my pals climb over the fence and start down the faint trod (path) beyond. “Grab the chains and ropes hanging down the steps. Don't look down.”
I go back up to the lighthouse with the fishermen. The day's catches include dabs, several cod and a conger eel (“poor man's scampi”). Catches vary from year to year, they tell me. “We fish from sandstone ledges and big rocks. Folk can get stranded by the tide.”
At the top I meet Frank Telfer, who farms the headland. It was his great-uncle Harold who hung the chains and cut the Fisherman's Steps in the soft rock with a hammer and chisel when he was in his late 70s. “It was among his last wishes before he died.”
As sunset approaches, the lighthouse lantern sensor lances a lemon-yellow beam towards the Isle of Man, where the faintest sparkle denotes street lights in Ramsey. As my friends approach, caught in the limelight, they too are beaming.

Bill Chambliss, a transformative force in conflict theory, the sociology of law, and criminology, died on February 22. Told he had little time to live when first diagnosed with cancer seven years ago, Bill characteristically broke all the rules. He lived with cancer as he had lived his life: on his own terms. Bill continued his research, published, traveled extensively, and taught until the very end. As he told me seven years ago, “I've never been afraid of living, and I'm not afraid of dying.”
Bill Chambliss was indeed unafraid. Despite spending long hours in the library and the archives doing research, he much preferred to be where the action was. As he explained in his paradigm-changing book On the Take: “Going to the streets of the city, rather than the records, may bring the role of corruption and complicity between political, economic, and criminal interests into sharp relief.” During the course of a productive 50-year career, Bill repeatedly went to the streets. He hung out with such notorious organized crime chiefs as Meyer Lansky as well as low-level drug dealers and petty criminals in Seattle; poppy growers, heroin traffickers, and CIA chiefs in Thailand's Golden Triangle; and pirates of many stripes, whenever he could find them.
Bill had a yearning for the street; he simply loved to be among those who were on the receiving end of an exploitive social system shaped by race and class. Even when not officially conducting research, he headed for the street. One personal example: After we arrived in Juneau after three sleepless rain-soaked nights camping on the deck of the Alaska State Ferry, Bill somehow managed to find an all-night poker game at a local Inuit hangout. (My wife and I headed straight to the nearest hotel; Bill claimed he won $100.) He had an unerring gift for seeking out those who lived in the ragged quarters, and a unique talent for framing their challenges in larger sociological terms. Bill's research exemplifies the very best of C. Wright Mills' sociological imagination. Bill lived the sociological imagination.
Bill had a yearning for the street; he simply loved to be among those who were on the receiving end of an exploitive social system shaped by race and class.
After earning his sociology B.A. in 1955 under the tutelage of Don Cressey at UCLA, Bill spent a year hitchhiking between labor camps as a migratory farmworker. There he learned first-hand about the everyday lives of the men, women, and children who lived in the most ragged of quarters. These were experiences that came to shape his work. After getting his sociology Ph.D. in 1962 at the University of Indiana, where he studied deviance under Alfred R. Lindesmith, Bill accepted an assistant professor position at the University of Washington in Seattle. He soon moved away from explaining crime and deviance in terms of such then-standard sociological framings as differential association (Cressey) or symbolic interactionism (Lindesmith). Bill instead began to develop his own approach, helping to shape the newly emerging theoretical framework termed conflict theory. This approach, radical in the early 1960s, traced its origins to Marx's emphasis on the universality of social conflict in class-based societies. Conflict theory argued that societies are best understood in terms of structurally embedded conflicts between social groups, as opposed to the then-prevailing functionalist view of societies as systems whose components inevitably function to produce overall social system stability.
Bill's first major published article, “A Sociological Analysis of the Laws of Vagrancy,” appeared in 1964 in Social Problems, and catapulted him to the forefront of the nascent conflict theory approach. In this seminal and widely cited article, he began with Marx's writings on the 14th through 16th century English vagrancy laws, which had classified peasants made landless under the enclosure movement as vagrants. Bill generalized from Marx's analysis, arguing that vagrancy laws had been enacted by different ruling elites throughout history, in order to provide those elites with low-cost quasi-slave labor. Eventually, he argued, vagrants came to be defined as criminals – an important shift for understanding the criminalization of the poor in class-based societies, including the United States.
In 1967 Bill moved to UC Santa Barbara as a tenured associate professor. This proved to be a highly productive period, including seven books that significantly impacted criminology and the sociology of law. Despite this intense pace of publishing, Bill remained close to UCSB's version of the street, serving as faculty adviser to the Black Students' Union during a time when tensions between the BSU and local police were at a flash point. The BSU had demanded the creation of a black studies program, and occupied the computer center in hopes of achieving that goal. (They eventually did.) The police, falsely believing the occupiers to be armed, were poised to move in. Bill played the key role in diffusing a tense situation, thereby avoiding a potentially bloody police crackdown on the occupiers.
In1969 Bill published Crime and the Legal Process, the first major monograph to set forth his evolving ideas. This important work sought to show how lower-class black crime was rendered more visible than middle-class white crime, resulting in much higher rates of criminalization among blacks. A similar argument was made in his ethnography of small town street gangs, “The Saints and the Roughnecks” (1973). This widely cited classic (even today it results in nearly 90,000 Google hits) was reproduced in virtually every sociology textbook for a generation. In it Bill shows how the petty crimes committed by white middle-class gang members resulted in a slap on the wrist, while the same crimes, when committed by white lower-class gang members, led to criminal records with lifelong adverse consequences. Bill also published the first research to come out of his Seattle experience, Boxman: A Professional Thief's Journal (1972). Bill gave voice to the life story of safecracker Harry King, by letting King tell his story in his own words.
During this period Bill and law professor Robert Seidman collaborated on a seminal textbook, Law, Order, and Power (1971), showing how class interests not only become law, but also shape the entire criminal justice system. Bill also published three edited books reflecting his developing understanding of law and social conflict: Sociological Readings in the Conflict Perspective (1973), Problems of Industrial Society (1974), and Criminal Law in Action (1975). In collaboration with sociologist Thomas Ryther, he also published his first introductory sociology textbook, Sociology: The Discipline and its Direction (1975). Two more were to come: one which he and I co-authored in 1997 – the first to mainstream globalization into a U.S. introductory textbook – and one with sociologist Daina Eglitis in 2012.
The University of Delaware hired Bill in 1976, where he published the book that was to establish him in the forefront of his field. On the Take: From Petty Criminals to Presidents (1978), which was based on his earlier Seattle research, exposed white-collar crime and corruption in that supposedly squeaky-clean city. In a rich, detailed, and inevitably controversial account, Bill argued that organized crime was not the result of the Mafia (or Cosa Nostra, as it had been relabeled during congressional hearings in the late '60s), but was rather “a political phenomenon which takes its character from the economic institutions that exist at a particular point in time.” Organized crime is central to politics, from the precinct to the presidency. Bill developed these ideas more fully under the concept of “state organized crime” in an important series of writings: Organizing Crime (with criminologist Alan Block, 1981); Whose Law? What Order? (with sociologist Milton Mankoff, 1981); Exploring Criminology (1988), where even piracy was found to be a form of state organized crime (Sir Francis Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for plundering Spanish ships and towns), and Making Law: The State, The Law, and Structural Contradictions (co-edited with sociologist Marjorie Zatz in 1993).
Nor did Bill mince words when he described state organized crime in his 1998 presidential address to the American Society of Criminology, whose annual meeting he themed “Crimes By and Against the State:”
The most important type of criminality organized by the state consists of acts defined by law as criminal and committed by state officials in the pursuit of their jobs as representatives of the state. Examples include a state's complicity in piracy, smuggling, assassinations, criminal conspiracies, acting as an accessory before or after the fact, and violating laws that limit their activities. In the latter category would be included the use of illegal methods of spying on citizens, diverting funds in ways prohibited by law (e.g., illegal campaign contributions, selling arms to countries prohibited by law, and supporting terrorist activities).
In 1986 Bill relocated to the Sociology Department at George Washington University, where he remained until his death. There he turned his attention to more local victims of state organized crime: residents of the District of Columbia's poorest black neighborhoods. To show the relationship between race, class, and criminalization, Bill amassed extensive statistical data about neighborhood characteristics, crime, and incarceration. But he also participated in “ride-alongs” with the self-styled “Dirty Harrys” of the Washington Police Department's Rapid Deployment Unit, in order to better understand how policing played out on the street. This research found its way into his 1993 presidential address to the Society for the Study of Social Problems, and eventually his book Power, Politics, & Crime (1999), where Bill argued that the “war against drugs” was both misplaced and a failure. He also showed that the media, police, and what has come to be known as the prison-industrial complex had manufactured the crime panic over supposedly predatory black males. In many ways this recent work reprises Bill's earliest insights from his original studies of vagrancy: criminalization, he shows, is part of a draconian system resulting in “the ghettoization of the African American community and the creation of an intractable class of abjectly poor.”
Bill continued making this argument until a few weeks before his death. In a Huffington Post article entitled “Obama's Drug Problem” that appeared on January 26, Bill again proved that he was a fighter for justice until the end. Never one to pull his punches, he pointed out both the hypocrisy and systemic corruption of the war on drugs:
Barack Obama admits to having tried cocaine and marijuana but has overseen the largest increase in imprisonment for drug possession in the country's history…. Law-enforcement agencies are themselves “addicted” to drugs. They have grown dependent on the crime-fighting statistics generated by drug arrests. The employment of prison staff depends on extraordinary rates of incarceration. The money that law-enforcement agencies generate from confiscating property seized in drug busts funds equipment, enhances salaries and pays for weapons.
Bill Chambliss was a towering figure in sociology. The author or co-author of nearly two-dozen monographs and edited books, along with countless chapters, journal articles, and popular pieces, he received numerous prestigious awards throughout his career. Among these are the Presidencies of the American Criminological Society and the Society for the Study of Social Problems, previously mentioned; Lifetime Achievement Awards from the American Sociological Association's sections on Criminology (1985) and the Sociology of Law (2009), as well as the Society for the Study of Social Problem's section on Law and Society (2009); the American Criminological Society's Major Achievement Award (1995) and Edwin H. Sutherland Award (2001); and the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences Bruce Smith Sr. Distinguished Leadership in Criminal Justice Award (1986). In 2008 Bill gave the Beto Chair Lecture in Criminal Justice at Sam Houston State University, and the following year he received an honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Guelph, Canada.
Reflecting his role as a teacher-scholar, mentor for many of today's leading criminologists and sociologists of law as well as thousands of students throughout his career, Bill received a singular honor from the Society for the Study of Social Problems in 2012: the creation of the William J. Chambliss Lifetime Achievement Award “to recognize career-spanning excellence and achievement in the area of law and society.”
Bill will be greatly missed by his wife Pernille, his sons Jeff and James, and daughter Lauren, his grandchildren, his students, his many friends. His legacy will live on in their memories, his writings, and the imprint he has left as a scholar who was never afraid to speak truth to power.
An app that allows users to rate people like they would rate a restaurant is scheduled for a November release, but it already has the internet up in arms.
Calgary-developed Peeple will allow users to rate other humans on a scale of one to five stars, much like a Yelp review.
All you need to create a profile for someone is their cellphone number. The subject of the profile cannot delete the comments or the rating, according to an article in the Washington Post.
"You're going to rate people in the three categories that you can possibly know somebody — professionally, personally or romantically," Peeple CEO and co-founder Julia Cordray told CBC Calgary in September. "So you'd be able to go on and choose your five-star rating, write a comment and you will not be anonymous."
Negative comments will sit unpublished in the person's inbox for 48 hours, giving them the opportunity to work out any disputes with the person who posted them, according to Peeple's website. If the dispute can't be resolved in that time, the comment will go live. The person can publicly defend themselves by commenting on the negative review.
According to the site, users must "agree" that they are 21 or over.
Cordray believes the app will help people make better decisions about who they interact with.
"You should have the right to know who somebody is before you invite them into your home, around your children. They become your neighbours, they teach your kids, you go on dates with them," said Corday.
It seems so far that few people on Twitter share her enthusiasm.
Many see potential for online bullying.

Scientists outfitted praying mantises with 3D glasses made of beeswax to confirm that the insects have 3D vision. But they couldn't show the mantises the equivalent of IMAX films.
A group of scientists at Newcastle University just published their findings on mantis vision in Scientific Results and shared some hilarious images of spectacled bugs with the world.

The study is especially interesting, since no one has really tested the 3D, or stereoscopic, vision of invertebrates before. Back in the 1980s, researchers put prisms of different powers in front of each of the eyes of a praying mantis. This induced it to make “systematic errors”—like always striking too shallowly to hit a target, or always striking to the right of a target—which indicated that they saw the world the way we did. It was not however, a direct test.
The Newcastle scientists first tried to get the mantis to use the current form of 3D glasses. Each lens is designed to either block out or let through a certain type of circularly polarized light. One lens filters out light if the wave seems to be moving in a counterclockwise circle and lets through clockwise light, while the other lens does the opposite. This allows two different images to be broadcast simultaneously with only one image going to each eye.

It works for humans. It did not work for mantises. When the scientists investigated why this should be, they came across a paper entitled, “Analysis of angular dependence of 3-D technology using polarized eyeglasses.” From that, they learned that in order to get each picture in each lens, the images have to be coming from directly in front of the person wearing the glasses. Turn too much and you get “crosstalk,” one signal getting in the way of another signal.
So to get the mantis to see in 3D, the researchers had to go back to “anaglyph” lenses—the red and blue lenses we get with 3D comics—and sometimes see in older movie theaters. Mantises can't see red light very well, so the scientists used green and blue lenses instead of red and blue lenses. This solved the crosstalk problem.

Then, the Newcastle team put the mantises on platforms and showed them an image of a dark prey-like object on a bright background, while ensuring the screen was well away out of their strike range. When the image was 2D, the prey was clearly too far away from the mantis, and it didn't strike. When the image switched to 3D, the mantises struck, because the prey appeared to “come off the screen” and hover within their reach.
The researchers will continue to study insect depth perception, and hope that it will lead them to a better understanding of how humans got depth perception.
And finally, here's the full picture of a praying mantis wearing 1950s style 3D glasses, just because.

No sex please: Fish prefer to play it safe
Safety in numbers wins out over an increased chance of sex when it comes to a native African fish, a new study finds.
The results, recently published in the journal Biology Letters, suggest a species of cichlid fish employs a complex decision-making process when joining a social group.
Lead author, University of New South Wales biologist Alex Jordan says the strategy employed by the fish is likely to be replicated in other group-joining species.
For the research Jordan examined the choices made by Neolamprologus pulcher found in Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania.
He says N. pulcher is unusual because it lives in social groups that include both breeders and helpers.
Jordan says the breeding pair can have between two to seven helpers who do tasks such as cleaning the nest, defending territory and looking after the eggs.
The helpers do not breed, instead waiting until a breeding position becomes available through the death of a more senior member of the group.
Previous genetic work has shown that N. pulcher within a group are unrelated, suggesting the young disperse to other groups.
Jordan says he wanted to find out what affected their choice of a new group.
Making a choice
For the experiment he and colleagues from McMaster University in Canada, collected whole groups and relocated them to a two-metre enclosure near the edge of the lake that replicated the original home environment.
A foreign fish was then placed at a rocky area in the middle and could then choose to join a group or remain alone.
In each instance the fish could choose between a group where they would be a senior fish with greater access to food and shelter and be next in line for the breeding position.
Or they could join a larger social group where they would be at the bottom of the queue for breeding.
Jordan says the fish would typically swim between the two groups and look at both before joining the larger group where they would be the most junior.
"They all passed up the golden opportunity," he says. "The question was do you take an early gamble and risk a lot or do you go for the safe option?
"The [N. pulcher] always took the conservative option, they were not gamblers."
Beaten up
Ironically in becoming a member of the larger group, the new fish also faced increased aggression within the group and constantly "beaten up", says Jordan.
But, he says, what seems like a poor decision on the surface actually offers benefit in the form of increased protection to the new subordinate fish.
Jordan says Lake Tanganyika has a high predation risk for the N. pulcher, which at its largest growth to about 11 centimetres.
Among its main predators are eels and large carnivorous fish.
"It looks like these social systems offer protection from this predation to smaller fish like N. pulcher," says Jordan.
"Individuals are willing to sacrifice short-term breeding success and pay the costs of increased aggression to join groups that offer greater safety from predation."
This entry was originally posted to the Burning Blog on September 28, 2015. The online survey is now closed, so the Census survey link will no longer work.
The BRC Census Lab conducts research on participants in Black Rock City and online after the event. We ask lots of questions about demographics and people's experiences, because we want to accurately describe the community and the culture of Black Rock City.
Below are the preliminary results from the Random Sample, the short paper form filled out by randomly selected participants entering Black Rock City. This is just the beginning of the 2015 data that will be released by the Census Lab. But for us to produce more findings, we need you — YES, YOU — to participate in the Black Rock City Census online survey, which is live now at census.burningman.org. If you attended Burning Man 2015 and have not already completed this survey, please take the time to do so now! The survey will close October 15. The more people who complete it, the more accurate our data will be. If everyone participates then it will be a true Census of Black Rock City!
The preliminary results are based on 2,270 forms collected by Census volunteers from randomly selected vehicles along Gate Road and Burner Express buses entering Black Rock City between Sunday, August 24 and Tuesday, September 1. This is the first year we've been able to begin random sampling five days before the event officially started, which means this year's data will include a larger number of early arrivers to Black Rock City. This may explain some of the differences observed in this year's results. The final results of the Random Sample may differ slightly from these preliminary ones.
Basic Demographics
Burner Experience
Burning Man Ticketing
Language and Residence
U.S. Politics
Please remember to participate at census.burningman.org before the survey closes. Some people think that because they participated in one of our data collection efforts on playa, they have already “done their Census”. Actually, our main survey is the online one. The online survey is not the same thing as the Random Sample, the short paper form you may have filled out when you entered BRC if you were randomly chosen. It is also not the same as the Field Notes books that you may have filled out at Census Lab or at Center Camp Café.
Even if you participated on playa, we still need your online survey data in order to generate good information about Black Rock City's 2015 population. So please participate today!
You will see that we ask a lot of questions in the online survey. This is because the Census is a collaboration between event organizers and several groups of researchers studying the BRC population and Burning Man culture. Part 1 of the Census asks basic demographic questions about the population. Organizers use these findings to advocate in favor of the community and the continued existence of the annual burn in Nevada, especially in dealing with authorities at the local, state, and national levels of government. Part 2 asks questions about this year's event, which various departments inside the organization need to know in order to plan for next year. Part 3 are questions written by researchers conducting social science projects. These Burning Nerds plan to publish the results in academic journals and books. And if you are still hungry for more questions after Part 3… there are options at the end of the survey to continue helping these scientists with their research.
Be sure to come back here for future blog posts about our methodology and about what we learn once we start analyzing the online survey data!

For years, I started campaigns by wrangling my friends into playing, having them quickly roll up characters, and jumping on the dark and mysterious road. There were always growing pains and some people who never moved beyond a character who hacked their way through every adventure. I always wanted the players to jump into the world more. And then I read about Zero Sessions.
A Zero Session is like making an outline for a fictional book, except it is done cooperatively—much like how I would think planning for a TV show or movie trilogy might go. The Game Master gives the setting and the base idea and lets their fellow storytellers build on that. In Dark Return, we have the Wanderers, which is the adventurer's guild. I have each new player fill out an application for the adventurers guild, which gives a starting point for both the players and the GM.
Here is the adventurer's application I give to all my players:
Application to the Wanderers, an Adventurer's Guild
Basic Information:
Why do you want to join the Wanderers?
Where are you from? Describe your age, social circles, family history (for more, see section Family).
If you had to describe yourself in three words, what would it be?
Name one fear.
Name two loves.
Describe two people who have had a big influence on you.
Describe one place that is very important to you.
Family
What is your family background?
Are you still close with them?
Friends
Do you have any childhood friends?
Are you still close with them?
Previous Adventures
Have you had any previous adventures?
Future
Name two goals.
—————————————————-
What This Does
It obviously gives me, as the Game Master, a place to start. It also gives the players time to work out a backstory and find out how they fit into the world and work with the other adventurers. Sometimes the worst surprise when setting up a campaign was what a player had decided they wanted when they were making their super-detailed character at home. This lets everyone craft the start together. This gives the players some buy-in to the world and campaign from the start.
I also always want the players to define one locale of the starting location. Everyone has a favorite haunt in their hometown or at least a place they have a story around. This creates a place for the character in the world. It also gives us GMs fodder for future encounters.
This little bit of paper, a night of a few beers, and discussion has always led to a better campaign. I hope it helps you build a better start to your own campaigns.
A social media campaign highlighting the plight of more than 1,500 hunger striking Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails has gone viral, with people from across the world posting videos of themselves on social media drinking salt water in solidarity.
Similar to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that went viral in 2014, the Salt Water Challenge sees supporters of the hunger striking prisoners drink a mixture of salt and water. The participants then challenge others to do the same.
Since April 17, Palestinian Prisoners Day, many prisoners in Israeli jails have been on an indefinite hunger strike protesting prolonged imprisonment without charge, medical negligence, administrative detention and limited family visits among other charges.
The prisoners have refused to eat food until their demands are met and they are only consuming salt water as a means to steady their health.
The salt water campaign was launched with a video by Aarab Marwan Barghouti, the son of imprisoned Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who is currently serving five life sentences over his role in the second Intifada against the Israeli occupation.
Barghouti has spent nearly two decades of his life in Israeli jails, and spent almost three years in solitary confinement. According to a 2013 interview, his tiny windowless cell denied him aeration or direct sunlight and was infested with cockroaches and rats.
"My father, along with 1,700 other political prisoners started the Hunger Strike for Freedom and Dignity in demand for human rights and humane living conditions in the prisons," Aarab Marwan Barghouti said in the video.
The clip then ends with Barghouti nominating "Arab Idol" winner Mohammed Assaf and others to take part in the challenge.
Assaf helped the campaign go viral which has now seen thousands of people take part in the challenge, including the 2017 winner of Arab Idol, Yacoub Shaheen.
According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, since the start of Israel's occupation 50 years ago, more than 750,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned by Israeli forces.
About 6,500 Palestinians are currently in Israeli jails, 300 are children.
Palestinian leaders have denounced Israel's refusal to negotiate with the hunger strikers, warning of a "new Intifada" if any of them die.
Demonstrations have been held in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to support the prisoners, with Israeli forces firing tear gas, rubber-coated steel bullets and live ammunition at protesters.
Looks like Clarence Thomas' wife is not only in support of the asshat-in-chief but actually sent out an email on a conservative Listserv trying to mobilize support around his policies.
“What is the best way to, with minimal costs, set up a daily text capacity for a ground up-grassroots army for pro-Trump daily action items to push back against the left's resistance efforts who are trying to make America ungovernable?” Virgina “Ginni” Thomas wrote on Feb. 13, according to information obtained by the Daily Beast.
“I see the left has Daily Actioned @YourDailyAction and their Facebook likes are up to 61K,” she continued, linking to a Washington Post story.
Daily Action encourages those who oppose Asshat to make daily calls to their local congressmen to complain about Asshat's agenda.
“But there are some grassroots activists, who seem beyond the Republican party or the conservative movement, who wish to join the fray on social media for Trump and link shields and build momentum,” Ginni Thomas wrote. “I met with a house load of them yesterday and we want a daily textable tool to start… Suggestions?”
Advertisement
Now, how this situation really gets sticky is that Asshat's Muslim ban may end up before the Supreme Court soon, and while Ginni Thomas' husband, Justice Clarence Thomas, doesn't speak much, he does vote.
Legal experts told the Daily Beast that if Justice Department lawyers decide to appeal a 9th U.S. Circuit Court ruling that upheld a previous judge's decision opposing the ban, the case could be moved to the Supreme Court, and that could pose problems for Clarence Thomas, including potentially having lawyers ask that he remove himself from the case.
“You can imagine circumstances easily where such conduct on the part of the spouse of a Supreme Court justice would lead to a nonfrivolous disqualification motion,” Heidi Li Feldman, a professor at Georgetown Law School and an expert on legal ethics, told the Daily Beast.

Feldman added that while spouses aren't banned from engaging in politics, the difference here is that Ginni Thomas seems to be mobilizing efforts for a specific case (read: Muslim ban) coming before the Supreme Court.
“It's pretty egregious,” Feldman told the Daily Beast. “It's pretty clear that it's quite partisan, and in context, given the date of the email and that the tool is meant to rebut activity on the left—what has the left been really active on? The executive orders. So, minimally, I would say the author of the email is thinking of that executive action.
“It's so specific, it's so narrowly tailored,” she added. “I was taken aback.”
The really messed-up part is that if Clarence Thomas deems himself fit to be impartial when deciding on the case, he can't be forced to recuse himself, since there is no governing body to force him off a case.

The Daily Beast notes that this wouldn't be the first time Justice Thomas found himself in a sticky situation in which he needed to decide if he could be impartial.
In 1996, Thomas recused himself from United States v. Virginia because the case involved enrollment at the Virginia Military Institute. Thomas' son was attending the institute at the time of the case.
“More recently, though, Thomas declined to recuse himself from a Supreme Court case on the Affordable Care Act, which his wife vocally opposed,” the Daily Beast reports.

Not everyone thinks Thomas needs to recuse himself from the case regarding the Muslim ban should it come before the Supreme Court.
“It's an important principle: Just because you're married to somebody doesn't mean you share all their views,” Charles Wolfram, a legal ethics expert and emeritus law professor at Cornell, told the Daily Beast.
However, he added: “As a matter of common sense, it seems to me it's just silly for [Ginni Thomas] to be emailing in this fashion.”

A handful of community supporters joined the fight, including Dr. Jose Moreno, Executive Director of Los Amigos, Maria Elena Durazo, Secretary-Treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and Rev. Eric Lee, Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Community organizers are asking "Wal-mart and Chairman Rob Walton to address take home pay so low that Associates are forced to rely on public programs to supporttheir families and understaffing that is keeping workers from receiving sufficient hours and is also hurting customer service," according to the release.

"We cannot stand by while the country's largest employer tries to silence workers who stand up for a better future for their families," said Durazo. "We are here to tell Wal-mart the company must change the way it treats workers and our community. Our city and our country need big profitable corporations like Walmart and billionaires like the Waltons to take responsibility for rebuilding our economy — and stop squeezing the middle class to the breaking point."
"OUR Walmart" is one of the nationwide moments fighting for change.
On Monday, The Daily Ticker spoke to "OUR Walmart" member Jackie Goebel, a Wisconsin-based Wal-mart employee. She said she makes just under $19 an hour and has worked for the company for 25 years.
"When I started, you got merit raises, a yearly raise and a raise at 90 days," said Goebel. "My pay has been capped for 6 years. I have no hopes of ever getting another pay raise probably."
Responding to the critique by "OUR Walmart," Wal-mart spokesperson Fogelman said: "We have some of the best jobs in the industry. We have good pay, affordable benefits and the opportunity for advancement which typically meet or exceed those at majority of competitors include unionized ones."

Presidential Debate: Romney Gets Aggressive, While Obama Holds Back
When I worked at Ha! Comedy club I had to bark to get my stage time by handing out flyers in Times Square. It is hard to believe that at one point the people handing out flyers or selling tickets to comedy clubs were actual comics doing it for stage time, but it is true. Now it has become a profession.
Times Square has been called the center of the universe, and with good reason. You have probably been there, so has your friend, if you know someone who has never been there, odds are that they will at one point or another and someone will ask them “do you like comedy?”
Times Square is awash with people. It is the bright lights-big city that people think of when they think of a big city with bright lights. It is beyond compare in it's majesty, it's opulence, size, scope and audacity for even existing. In the early 2000's, Times Square had been cleaned up to the point it was tourist friendly but had not become the outside pedestrian mall it is today. Back then it still had it's old Coke sign, not the digital monstrosity they have now. Cars and taxi's could still speed down 7th avenue blaring their horns at people to get out of the way. It wasn't much but there was still a sense of danger in Times Square. People from all over the world would come by with a “this was New York, you can do anything” attitude. Taxis would try to beat the pedestrian's crossing the street, law enforcement would ride their horses up and down the block directing traffic, helping people and cursing up a storm. This mix of humanity was chaos in motion. 50,000 people going in 50,000 directions with no rules.
Now it is cordoned off, now it is a mall with chairs for people to sit and watch the world go by like they were on a picnic under an old oak tree in a Robert Frost poem. Anyone ever dies in a Robert Frost poem? It is every New Yorkers right to bitch and moan about how much Times Square has changed in their lifetime. My father still complains that since it got cleaned up there is not as much crime, prostitution, shell games or sex shops. He refers to them all as “character” though as in “Times Square has no fucking character anymore”. He said this when the first Warner Brothers store went up in the 90's. My father's Times Square was a shitstain, mine was clean with shitstains if you knew where to look, now it is just clean.
5-6 PM
Times Square like any living creature had its own ebbs and flows. The start of a typical Ha! shift had me out in the square around 5 PM. Daylight still in the air, at this time it usually consisted of families in the middle of a long day. Hot and sweaty kids would complain about “walking everywhere” and adults would be complaining about “my kids complaining”. Times Square at 5 PM was tired and in need of a rest. Trying to bark at this time was fairly pointless, but you never knew what the result would be. With the first show at 6:30 the usual questions from the tourists would revolve around if the show was “kid friendly”. My usual reply was that there was a lot of swearing but limited nudity, so it was up to their definition of kid friendly.
6-7 PM
The square would really start to pick up in action during this time. Families going to theme restaurants because they didn't know everyone in NYC ate much later. Street entertainers would start showing and illegal vendors would put out the knock off Prada/Louis Vuitton handbags on sheets for people looking to get a deal. It made a crowded corner more crowded but I figured that they were doing the same thing I was, but without the luxury of a club to go to when done.
If you have never seen a NYC street team perform they are amazing dancers that can do physically amazing things. Don't get too close though, on more than one occasion I have seen them gather a crowd and start dancing and flipping to music, then they start spinning on their head, then an unsuspecting tourist gets too close and thwack! Sneaker to the head, I am sure that when the street dancers applied for their permits they had to show proof of insurance. I don't think anyone got seriously hurt but several did have a Nike swoosh imprint for a few days.
7-7:45 PM
The square was pure bedlam at this time. As the hour got later you could feel the surge of humanity growing like an incoming tsunami. This was a good time to bark, yes you had people going to shows or dinner but a large majority of people coming to NYC are there to gawk at the city and just wander. Those people were susceptible to my charms. They wanted fate to tell them what to do, and there I was with a flyer in my hand. I once tried to count how many people walked by me during that time. I lost track after 150 in the first minute.
7:45-8:15
Drowning in people, barking was pointless. In addition to the regular throngs, you had large groups running past you trying to get to the start of the Broadway show they had tickets for. “It's ovah here!” the mom would yell as they tried running down 7th avenue. Then five minutes later, “I knew it was the other way” as they rushed past trying to swim upstream like a salmon. “Then well why didn't you say something earlier?” the mom would bellow, followed by “kids, stay close….CLOSER!!! Get out of the street!!!”
“But there are fewer people” the kids would cry in unision.
“Get! Out! Of! The! Street! Now!” Mom would say sternly.
A cab would honk. The cab driver would yell “get out of the street asshole” in an undefinable accent.
“We will never make the start” the father would lament, crying into his hands and wondering where his life and/or vacation had gone wrong.
During this time I just wanted to scream. Everyone just shut the fuck up and have a magical time at the Lion King alright?
8:15-10:00
Calm. Theater goers are all in the theaters, no more people rushing past. Like the ocean between waves. You could take a moment to breathe surrounded by a few thousand people. These were people who wanted to see Time Square itself. No urgency to run anywhere. The location was the destination. During this time it was easy to bark, to strike up conversations with tourists and play tour guide.
I often found myself taking photos of the tourists in front of the TKTS booth. It was with great satisfaction that I would have them all stand together, hold up the camera and yell “gotcha” while turning my back and running a few feet away with their camera. Either no one ever cared enough to give serious chase or their tourist reaction time was slow but no one ever came after me. They all would have smiles when I turned around and took the actual photo, and were a little disappointed that they were not going home with a story about how some guy stole their camera in Time Square.
Now they all just take selfies.
Traditionally New Yorker's hate tourists, but I found these people were there to see the city and spend their money. Often they were easy to take a flyer and would show up ready for a good time.
10:00-11:00
Bedlam again. Now the tourists are coming out of the theaters, the sidewalks and corners become overcrowded with them trying to figure out how to get back to their hotels. Fifty people would have their hands raised to try and hail the non-existent cabs that would never come. They would all stand in front of each other and jostle for position. The post-theater crowd was worse than the pre-theater crowd in that now they found themselves in a strange place at dark. You could smell fear on some of them.
The opposite was also true. Seeing kids in the square at this time was almost magical. As they exited the theaters singing songs they just heard they see Times Square lit up in all of it's glory. If wide eyed wonder could be caught in a bottle this is where they would catch it.
Of course they were all too young to come to a comedy club so I never paid much attention to them and since the parents had to get them home, I knew they were not going to take a flyer either. Kids were a barker forcefield that repelled the best of us.
11:00-1:00
The dregs, the drunks, the high school kids who thought this was the “real” New York, the thugs, the drunks, the lost, the found, the drunks. These were the people who populated Times Square at this time. When barking to these people they always asked how much drinks cost at the club, always made an idiotic joke about the two drink minimum.
Usually one would say “I am funny as fuck, how do I get on stage”.
We all have at least one friend who cannot hold their liquor, that when drunk becomes an obnoxious version of themselves but since you have been friends with them for so long you just laugh them off. Now imagine them in that state of mind but in New York FUCKING City, where anything can happen……whooooooooo!!!!!!!! No rules!
Multiply that by 500 and that was Times Square at this time.

× MS lawmaker proposes special car tags for convicted DUI offenders
JACKSON, Miss. — A lawmaker from Mississippi wants to pass a bill forcing the state's repeat DUI offenders to have special automobile tags.
Representative Gary Chism of Columbus is currently working on the bill that would require anyone who has been convicted of their second DUI to have a special tag on their car.
“If you ain't learned your lesson after the first one, then we need to step in and do something to get your attention,” Chism is reported as saying by The Clarion-Ledger. “Maybe if all your neighbors know, and the Highway Patrol know, they won't be as likely to get out there weaving on the roads again.”
Similar laws are already on the books in Ohio, Minnesota, Oregon and Iowa.
The main problem Chism is facing now is figuring out how to tighten down on the law to prevent DUI offenders from taking advantage of any loopholes.
Opponents of similar bills argued it unnecessarily humiliates misdemeanor offenders, sometimes causes them to lose their jobs, and sets a “trend of over-criminalization.”
Under current Mississippi law, first-time offenders can have their license suspended for 90 days, or be forced to install an interlock device on their car.
Abstract
The relationship between leisure activities and development of cognitive impairment in aging has been the subject of recent research. We examined television viewing in association with risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a case-control study. Given recent focus on the importance of intellectually stimulating activities as preventive measures against cognitive decline, it is important to examine the effects of less stimulating but common activities. Data are from 135 Alzheimers disease cases and 331 healthy controls. Demographic characteristics and life history questionnaire responses on the number of hours spent on 26 leisure activities during middle-adulthood (ages 40-59) were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to examine the effects of middle-adulthood leisure activities on case vs. control status. Results indicate that for each additional daily hour of middle-adulthood television viewing the associated risk of AD development, controlling for year of birth, gender, income, and education, increased 1.3 times. Participation in intellectually stimulating activities and social activities reduced the associated risk of developing AD. Findings are consistent with the view that participation in non-intellectually stimulating activities is associated with increased risk of developing AD, and suggest television viewing may be a marker of reduced participation in intellectually stimulating activities.

When he was alive, George Carlin was never afraid to speak his mind. In fact, Carlin even went to jail for standing up for his right to speak what was on his mind.
On July 21, 1972, Carlin was arrested after performing his routine at Milwaukee's Summerfest and charged with violating obscenity laws for saying the words, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.
To some people, saying the words is shock humor or silly. However, to Carlin, these words were verbal activism. Had he not pushed the envelope on what we can't say, free speech would still be in the stone age.
Carlin was an activist against censorship and the politically correct and he was so well received because he possessed a genius knack for relaying these ideas to people in a humorous manner.
Carlin became famous for his comedy routines, during which he would call out everything from religion to government.
Before his death in 2008, Carlin wrote book titled, When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?, in which he blasted everything from the dumbing down of America to the politically correct police.
What made this last book by Carlin special was the fact that he read it aloud himself and released it an an audiobook.
Below is a brief excerpt of that book about the dangers of being ‘PC'. As it starts out, Carlin explains how being politically correct is actually intolerance disquised as tolerance.
Political correctness is America's newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance. It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people's language with strict codes and rigid rules. I'm not sure that's the way to fight discrimination. I'm not sure silencing people or forcing them to alter their speech is the best method for solving problems that go much deeper than speech.
In the short excerpt below, Carlin explains just how slippery of a slope, the PC police can lead us down. It's important that we get past ‘being offended' and move on to true tolerance — one that allows for the voicing of any opinion — no matter how ‘offsensive' it might be.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened to file a lawsuit Tuesday if Congress passes pro-Second Amendment legislation that would roll back the state's major 2013 gun control law known as the SAFE Act.
“If they try to overrule the State of New York we will sue because this state has rights too,” Cuomo told reporters. “And especially with this federal government, it is very important that states represent their rights and assert their rights and I will assert my rights to the fullest extent of the law.”
The Second Amendment Guarantee Act (H.R. 3576), or SAGA, proposed by New York Republican Rep. Chris Collins, would void present state and local gun laws that are more restrictive than federal regulations.
Sarah Minkel, a spokeswoman for Collins, touted his legislation telling The New York Daily News, “Governor Cuomo took away the Constitutional rights of Americans when he signed the so-called SAFE Act into law.”
“If Governor Cuomo wants to criticize Congressman Collins for sticking up for his constituents by protecting their Second Amendment rights, or for working to reduce their property taxes, he can answer to them in 2018,” Minkel added.
In addition, the bill prevents states and municipalities from enacting any kind of of gun laws in the future that are more stringent than federal regulations.
The legislation would not only affect a state like New York but also states like Colorado, California, Maryland, New Jersey, and Connecticut that have gunned restrictive laws. These state laws can range from limiting firearm magazine rounds to banning certain types of firearms and registering ammunition.

The CBC has been plastering bus stops and billboards with ads for its new television season, but the national broadcaster's most important fall launch is not a scripted series about a family who runs a convenience store. It is a reimagining of a significant section of the news division, the most vital service the CBC ultimately provides to Canadians.
Coming this fall to CBC.ca is an opinion vertical, a space devoted exclusively to commentary and analysis of the day's news.
As with almost anything the CBC tries, this shift has already drawn criticism. The most consistent has come from media circles, a variation on a common theme against most of CBC's digital properties – that they have an unfair advantage over their competitors. With the sort of stable funding most media organizations can only dream of, the argument goes, the CBC's ability to give both writers and advertisers a major national platform makes it much, much harder for smaller, independent news organizations to find a foothold, much less grow to stable size.
That is a point you could pretty easily level against the entire CBC apparatus, if you were so inclined. The whole discussion, though, is a bit of a canard. Embedded within it, is a far more salient point, albeit one that is trickier to parse out. Namely that, in this media climate, it is irresponsible for the CBC to be offering commentary and opinion, particularly when it is doing so out of its own news budget.
In fairness here, an opinion section is not so much new to the CBC as it is a new emphasis: the CBC's website has featured commentary, including specific columnists, since its inception, and talking heads are a staple of its radio and television broadcasts, from Cross-Country Check-up to the At Issue panel on The National.
This concentrated digital effort, though — full disclosure, the CBC has hired Robyn Urback away from the National Post for this venture — signifies the growing prominence of opinion writing in the CBC stable. It also represents an effort to stay in line with the times: informed commentary – well, I mean, presumably informed, certainly commentary – having become one of the internet's preferred ways of processing information and drawing eyeballs.
If you are willing to grant that the CBC does a lot of relevant and even otherwise unfeasible journalistic work outside of this commentary, however, the new emphasis ultimately raises questions about the purpose of media: why is it actually important that we should have the media, and in particular a publicly funded version of it, in the first place? The answer is not quite as straightforward as it would seem. Or at least, like most questions of purpose, it can get mixed up with a lot of other issues and concerns that affect it.
We are in the midst of a great debate about the value of media: the rather dire financials of most media organizations has encouraged both people who make it and people who want to keep consuming it to figure out what separates media – or maybe more precisely, journalism – from any other pleasant diversion. The answer typically boils down to the fact that journalism and the access to information it provides is an essentially a pillar of democracy Put another way: in order to make anything resembling an educated decision about how to live in the world, we need the media to find and report on stories that are capable of changing how we see the world: stories that undermine the official narrative, that bring to light something that would rather be kept dark, that try to understand the world as it actually is, not just as we'd like to be.
Unlike its larger media brethren, CBC is not in a place whose survival depends on attracting a sufficient number of readers
The obvious examples are the grand, scandal-inducing stories about groping presidential candidates or egregiously wasted public money: “afflicting the comfortable and comforting the afflicted” is how we might put it, if we were trying to inspire a room full of journalism grads walking into a world where 90ish per cent of their jobs are going to be in communications for powerful entities. We have reached the point in media contraction, though, where even more prosaic stories – such as your city council debating transit plans or proposing changes to the tax code – are in danger of going unreported. This kind of information might not bring down kings, but it represents the kind of simple but essential details that could easily get lost without a devoted media.
Assuming we can all agree that this is the media's vital public role, the more cynical among us might still poke their heads up to note that a whole lot of our media, CBC or not, has precisely nothing to do with any of that. Even if we narrow our definition of media to places that also do some good, honest investigating and fact-finding, you will still find stuff such as interviews with baseball players on what kind of game they had, stories about which celebrities are divorcing, someone telling you that bike lanes are stupid and yes, even searching, self-aware inquisitions into what the role of the media is. Stuff that may reflect some of the rich tapestry of a well-lived life, say, but not exactly what you might deem necessary for the functioning of a healthy democracy.
The easiest explanation for all these sports and arts and lifestyle and opinion might be that it's mostly vestigial. It may come as a shock to our modern race of cyborgs with constant access to a hive mind in their pocket, but general information used to be much, much harder to come by: box scores for the game between the Jays and the Cleveland Racist Stereotypes, sure, and what time the movie started and who directed it, yes, but also where one might find a used bookshelf, or where to apply for a job opening, if one were so inclined (the gutting of classified ad revenue was the first major hit to print-based media). Newspapers in particular used to be something more akin to community message boards, with occasional scoops.
As that information has become much, much easier to find, the sports and arts and lifestyle stuff has stuck around, perhaps out of nothing more than habit, but also because they are, relatively speaking, popular features that are easy to produce. This isn't to say that anyone can write something worth reading about Auston Matthews's four-goal debut, but that, compared to the time and effort of uncovering the mafia's role in civic construction bids, it is pretty straightforward: the former requires the ability to watch a hockey game and maybe to Google, the latter months of potentially dangerous digging that could conceivably result in nothing publishable.
In this era, it is not egregious to say that the less relevant things help keep the lights on (albeit inefficiently) for the more obvious public good. By virtue of their relative ease, though, and the Internet's incredible ability to disseminate information, these “easier” things are also being increasingly taken over by people and even sometimes organizations with no particular interest or concern for the harder things. Why sink a cost if people will pay you enough without bothering?
Commentary – at least as it's practiced on editorial pages and on CBC News – exists somewhere between deep-diving investigations and interesting diversions. Considered analysis of politicians or legal issues or scandalous revelations certainly has more relevance to our understanding of a functioning democracy than does celebrity gossip, even though there wouldn't be much on which to thoughtfully comment without original news gathering. Even if there is a wide range of quality – some is the result of interviews with many sources and relevant figures, some is people making up friends and borrowing block quotes with minimal attribution, most is somewhere in the middle, (hopefully) careful thought by people with a reasonable background in their subject – any debate on topics of public policy is good debate.
And yet the initial investment is still relatively low, with its ease of transmission still relatively high. So, more than ever, we have access to academic experts, those with personal experience, activists, or even just informed hobbyists, providing analysis to whoever is inclined to find it relevant. It would be naive to assume that this has raised the quality of this analysis, though it would be equally so to suggest that the biases of a few gatekeepers invariably found the most informed opinions before. The relevant point is that we are awash in any point of view you care to explore.
Which brings us back to the CBC, and its opinions. It may once have been a relevant defence that it could give a platform to voices we might not otherwise hear. But it's hard to credibly make that case when there are not only social media platforms and blogs but also functioning organizations – one could point to anything from Canadaland to The Ethnic Aisle, Rabble.ca to The Rebel – that are able to signal-boost these voices on a relatively minimal overhead.
Right now, the CBC alone has the ability to keep information flowing to places like Whitehorse, Rimouski and Churchill. It may not be long before it is the only option for larger centres
On top of that, unlike its larger media brethren, CBC is not in a place whose survival depends on attracting a sufficient number of readers. If we assume that the media as a whole is engaged in keeping the lifeblood of democracy pumping, the continued presence of opinion and analysis (and sports and arts and crosswords) is something like triage: a priority only insomuch as we're trying to keep as many alive as possible, by whatever means necessary. With relatively stable funding, CBC News doubling down on opinion is a doctor rushing a case of sniffles to the emergency room. Every dollar that the CBC spends on having someone explain the news to you is another it doesn't have to pay someone to actually go and find it.
Slow-burn, deep-dive reporting already makes little financial sense in much of Canada, and as revenue streams and sideline attractions are slowly but surely pared off from existing media organizations, it will only be harder in more and more places. This will (if it hasn't already) eventually extend to even the basic informative functions of journalism, that base-level information that keeps cities, provinces and territories running smoothly.
Right now, the CBC alone has the ability to keep information flowing to places like Whitehorse, Rimouski and Churchill. It may not be long before it is the only option for larger centres like St. John's, Saskatoon and Kingston. That it aims to divert some of its source into telling you what to think about that information is to fundamentally misunderstand its terrain.
At a time when the most relevant public role of the media is under constant threat, the better metaphor for the CBC as a publicly funded institution might be a utility company. Able to traverse a vast country without the top-line relevance of profitability, it can provide a vital public service where others simply can't. Opinion is not one of those services.

AMY GOODMAN: We're turning now to our last segment. We go to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where former President Bill Clinton found himself in an unlikely 30-minute debate with a 24-year-old Bernie Sanders supporter last week. Bill Clinton was campaigning for Hillary Clinton, of course, when he stopped at a Mexican restaurant in Santa Fe. There he met Josh Brody, who questioned him about his presidential record, from welfare reform to the deregulation of Wall Street to government spending. To find out what happened, we're joined by Josh Brody, graduate of The New School here in New York, who questioned Bill Clinton in Santa Fe.
What happened? What did you ask? And were you satisfied with President Clinton's responses, Josh?
JOSH BRODY: Hi, Amy. Thank you so much for having me. Well, no, I wasn't satisfied with the responses. What I had asked about was Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the Commodities Future Modernization Act and Gramm-Leach-Bliley, in addition to his overall government spending.
AMY GOODMAN: Can I ask you, how did you—
JOSH BRODY: And so, the reason I was—
AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you—Josh, can I ask how you ended up being in the restaurant with President Clinton?
JOSH BRODY: Sure. Well, I'm just home visiting my parents for the week, and this is a restaurant five minutes from my house. He made an unannounced campaign stop. And I actually didn't notice him in the restaurant until, oh, maybe 30 seconds before he approached my table.
AMY GOODMAN: So, continue with the issues that you raised and his responses.
JOSH BRODY: Well, so, one of the reasons I wasn't satisfied with his answers is because he rooted a lot of them in economic data. He would talk about how the African-American unemployment rate reached its lowest point under his administration and how median household wages peaked in 1999. But there are two problems with that. First is, both of the statistics are misleading. Wages peaked in part because people were working more hours. In fact, the average median hourly wage has been basically flat since the '70s. And then, in terms of another often-cited statistic that both he and Hillary Clinton have used on the campaign trail is that African-American unemployment was at record lows. But as authors such as Michelle Alexander show, that's because African Americans were being arrested in record high numbers. And if you look at the unemployment rate including the prison population, it actually wasn't all that low.
The other thing I found shocking, though, if I may, about this was, what I had asked him about originally was Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which was our welfare legislation at the federal level, that he basically gutted. And when I asked him about it—and I shouldn't have been so surprised, because the bill was called the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, “personal responsibility” being the operative phrase. He kept invoking a “culture of dependency” argument, similar to what you will hear anyone from Ronald Reagan talk about, when he discusses the mythical welfare queen, to Paul Ryan, when he talks about dependency in our inner cities. It's a racially coded argument, and he was blowing into that dog whistle very hard.
And his essential argument—and I was really surprised to hear this; I would have thought he'd change the rhetoric over the last 20 years—but his essential argument was that poor people are lazy, and if you give them welfare, they'll be dependent on the government, and that he was told this by people on welfare, and therefore it needed to be cut and turned into block grants for the states. There used to be 68 out of every person below the poverty line—out of every hundred people below the poverty line on welfare. We're now at 26. And I had responded that maybe the reason people don't have jobs isn't because they're lazy, but because there simply aren't jobs, and his administration had moved away from the notions of the government interfering in the economy to improve the lives of the people, such as the federal jobs programs that came under FDR. Bill Clinton essentially ripped the heart out of the Democratic Party and abandoned that notion that the government can make the lives of its people better and should invest in a robust social safety net. So that's how the discussion started. It went many other places.
AMY GOODMAN: Josh Brody, as we wrap up right now, you were talking to President Clinton about his policies. How do you feel about Hillary Clinton?
JOSH BRODY: I mean, she's in many ways responsible. I think it's a little hypocritical for people to say that it was his administration and not hers, given that she was known for the transformative role of the first lady, where she was more involved than any other first lady. So, I do not deny her agency. I think she's culpable for all of the policies we discussed, whether it's shrinking the government, getting rid of welfare, allowing corporations to have more power to offshore jobs through NAFTA, the deregulation of Wall Street, which, by the way, deregulating derivatives occurred just a few months before her Senate campaign. She then received a lot of Wall Street donations. And then I also object to her record in the Senate, where she again would deregulate Wall Street and was actually more hawkish in her votes in terms of foreign policy than the Clinton administration, although I would disagree with his foreign policy, as well.
So, overall, I'm very disappointed. And if—and I plan to vote for Jill Stein, because I believe New Mexico will win by double digits; however, if the race does seem close, unfortunately, I will have to vote for her, which is not something I'm happy about.
AMY GOODMAN: Josh Brody, I want to thank you for being with us. Sounds like a very interesting half-hour you had when you went to have a meal at the Mexican restaurant in Santa Fe. I thank you for being with us.
Last month, District 9 director Neill Blomkamp launched his experimental short film project, Oats Studios, releasing an alien invasion film called Rakka, and later, an alternate-history Vietnam War film called Firebase. Now, the director has shared his latest short film, Zygote, which features War of the Worlds and Twilight star Dakota Fanning.
Compared to the other films, Zygote is a comparably straightforward affair. It opens with two people trapped in a mining facility somewhere in the Arctic Circle. They're fleeing a horrific creature made of body parts from other members of the station.
I spoke with Blomkamp about the genesis of the film's creature, why corporate skullduggery appeals to him, and what's next for Oats Studios.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
The first thing that came to mind when I watched Zygote is its similarities to classic sci-fi and horror. Is it safe to say that The Thing and Alien have a bit of influence here?
Probably more The Thing for this particular film. Its DNA is a kind of ‘80s leviathan, science fiction horror.
What inspired the story?
I was on a flight from Vancouver to Toronto, and I don't know what made me think of it, but I wrote down “a monster made out of men.” I had this idea of a creature that was a bunch of stitched-together limbs that someone assembled into some some kind of monstrosity. I was actively looking for a science fiction / horror piece to do, and it grew from there.
So what happens in the days and hours before Zygote kicks off?
So, I came up with the original concept, and I wrote the film with [The Gone World author] Thomas Sweterlitsch, and Terri Tatchell [Blomkamp's wife and District 9 co-writer]. Thomas came up with the idea that Earth is inundated with asteroids 20 years from now: massive amounts of asteroids fall all over the planet, and there's a concentration of them in Northern Canada and Russia. They bring with them some really unique semiconductors and materials that we aren't familiar with on Earth. So these mining corporations become these larger, 21st century versions of Google, where all the venture capital goes into extracting these incredibly precious metals.
In the asteroid, there's this trap that's been flying around for who-knows-how-many billions of years. I really liked the idea of a light wave transmitting gigabytes of data into a mind, and that's what happened in the mining facility: when the miners crack open the rocks, this light bounces into their eyes, it sends them down this spiral. It basically teaches them how to make a biological substrate that it can live in. Essentially, it wants to make them a body. That's where this monster comes from.
I want to talk a little bit about the monster in Zygote. You noted that your original concept was a monster made of men. How did you go about developing its visual design?
We have this really awesome organic designer here at Oats named Ian Spriggs. Basically any organic character, whether it's a monster or a human, he'll build it.
I posed the idea of a creature that would be made out of many humans, and that it's specifically stitched together — it's not an organic growth thing — so the circulatory and respiratory systems and everything had to be combined into this sort of horrific Frankenstein job.
Doug Williams, a two-dimensional illustrator, came up with a sequence of different looks and then took it into 3D. We ended up with this bipedal design. I went to him asked how many people it took, and it was actually more than I thought: he needed 46 people to make the creature that you see. That's how many limbs and eyes and stuff merged into that creature.
How did you go about animating that character?
If you look at something like Chappie or District 9, those would be cases of what the the animation industry terms as rotomation, which means the animators are trying to trace animate what the actor is doing. In the case of Zygote, the creature isn't anthropomorphic. It's much heavier, and it can't really be mimicked by humans. We had a stunt guy on stilts, who was simply a timing and visual reference for the camera operators and the actors.
Once we get the piece together, we give those shots to the visual effects animators, who basically animate what they imagine is a heavier, slower, and stronger creature than what a human would be.
I love the idea of it testing out all of its fingers to see what works on the biometrics pad.
It's made out of all of the people that work there, so some of them are going to have access to certain areas of the mining facility and it knows that. It also has the cerebral data from everyone that it's gathered. It's formidable: it knows everything that anyone who was absorbed into it.
Looking back on District 9, body horror is something that you've used before. What about it appeals to you?
I'm not actually sure. I'm pretty grossed out by all things related to our own mortality and how susceptible and fragile the human body is. I think that is, probably on some deeper psychological level, just working its way into this stuff that I make. Science fiction, horror, and fantasy have so much room for psychological analysis of whatever has gone into making whatever work it is.
There's another subplot here, where Dakota Fanning's character, Barkley, learns that she's actually human, not a robot. What's the backstory here?
I love the idea of these orphans that are auctioned off to companies that are supposed to be using synthetic humans as manual labor. Flesh is cheaper than the robotics, even if they're organic robotics. I feel like there's a lot that you could do with the character if we wanted to turn this into a feature film.
Something I've noticed about your films is that they almost always seem to contain a large wall with the company name, big numbers, or writing painted on it. What is about that design is appealing to you?
That's interesting. I don't know. In the case of Zygote, I definitely wanted it to feel like this suppressive mining operation, where it's constantly reminding you what your status is, what area you're in, or what you should be doing. It's kind of like Big Brother and things like “Please remain still for 30 seconds” written in the airlock makes it feel like this authoritarian, oppressive environment.
That sort of tracks to what the characters are wearing: it designates their status in the company.
Right. If the mine was just operating normally, it would be very distinctly divided between real, organic human and synthetic humans.
That actually reminds me a little bit of Duncan Jones' 2009 film Moon where clones, who didn't realize that they were actually clones, were put to work as miners. Corporate skullduggery is a pretty prevalent feature in most of your work, whether it's Multinational United, Armadyne, or Tetravaal. What is it about that that appeals to you as a storyteller?
It's interesting that corporations and an extreme laissez faire capitalistic mindset will put ethics and morality behind profit. That's kind of how the world works, and there's something in there that I find pretty fascinating.
You know what's more like Moon, just thinking it through, is Cooking with Bill.
Oh really?
I think that Bill is in some form a recurring nightmare, where each time something happens to him, another Bill is unfrozen and brought up to the cooking floor.
Poor Bill.
That may be shot for Volume 2.
Zygote is far more linear than your first Oats film, Rakka. Did you find that you approached writing them differently?
It's just experimentation: the whole company is meant to be a place of creativity. If you ask a filmmaker to show you 20 minutes of a bigger world, some directors would come back with a presentation of a non-linear landscape like Rakka while others would come back with one like Zygote. It's just a creative intuition into how you feel like on certain things. You could just as easily do a Rakka version of Zygote, where you show the asteroids falling, how the world economy responded, and the characters that you will be traveling along this journey with. But we're just playing around: it's fun to do it this way, and it's fun to do it that way.
Everything is destined to be a feature or a TV show or something. It's all meant to be something bigger. In Rakka, we show 20 minutes inside of that world. That's an incredibly non-linear story: it's truly what the goal was: to show people what the world feels like. Firebase is somewhere between the two, where it's a snapshot, but has a slightly more linear line to it. Zygote is almost like a segment lifted out of a film. All three do the exact same thing: there's no person that would watch any of theses films and come out of it not knowing what the world is about. That's the goal.
Now that Oats has kicked off, have you found that your creative juices are flowing a bit more?
No. Let's assume that all the finances and the economic ecosystem of the company was figured out: I think the answer would be yes. But because we're still trying to figure out the smartest way to go forward financially, I'm unfortunately focusing on that. The company needs to be stable and up on its feet in order for me to think about what Volume 2 would consist of. That's an incredibly complex problem to solve.
I must say, though, that we initially came up with and wrote way more scripts than we are making, mostly because some of the ideas I wrote down were simply too expensive. That's the frame of mind that I'm usually in. I'm really excited by some of the older ideas that we couldn't make in Volume 1, and if we get the economics figured out, there's a range of stuff that I'm pretty excited to go off and make.
How does production for Oats work, shooting multiple short films?
There were several shoots, but there's an economy of scale — an efficiency of shooting more stuff together. We did shoot a certain number of the bigger pieces together in one continuous shoot, where the crew was mobile, but over all of the minutes of footage we shot, there were three to four separate shoots.
What happens when you're done with the shoots? Did you guys work on Rakka, Firebase, and Zygote one at a time this spring, or all at once?
It's really amazing trying to manage the amount of projects inside a small company like this. In the beginning, we were a little bit more scattered, and not quite as focused on working 100 percent on one piece and getting it done, and then moving onto the next one. Within departments like composing or animation or fluid simulation, I think we found a really efficient way to work on several projects at once. In the beginning it was sort of weird for everyone to be working so many pieces, even though were smaller, as opposed to working on one big piece. It took us several months for us to find our feet.
As you are working on each film, did you find that you were learning things on one film that you applied to another?
Yes. That's part of the efficiency of how we're doing stuff inside of Oats. We're probably being far more efficient than typically how things would be done in Hollywood, because there is a sharing and cross-pollination that happen.
Are there any specific examples of these improvements? Was there something in a story that was really originally in another one?
Not exactly now, but in Volume 2, there's “if you kind learn from the first piece, take what you want and leave the rest.” It's like you could have a sequel to Firebase, but you could have a total spinoff that has nothing to do with it and doesn't even reference the original idea, which turns it into a whole new film. That's what happened.
In terms of specific, technological things, I'd have to chat with the effects guys, but I don't know, I have to go and see the effects guys. I know we do it a lot though.
You've got one more film coming up in Volume 1.
Yes, Lima. That's a bit more like a current-day thriller. I don't know yet when it will be released.
“The tweet was never intended to be a political endorsement," the studio said in a statement.
Sony has deleted a tweet posted earlier in the week that was perceived by some as an endorsement of Hillary Clinton.
The tweet read: "Boo-yah, we smashed your glass ceiling. There was a ghost behind it. #ImWithHer #BustTheCeiling #Ghostbusters."
On Friday, the studio released a statement explaining why the post was taken off the verified movie account, which has more than 60,000 followers.
“The tweet was never intended to be a political endorsement. It was a shout-out to our own glass ceiling-busters," Sony said in the statement.
Paul Feig's female-led reboot stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones.
On Thursday, Clinton officially became the first female presidential candidate for a major U.S. party.
Earlier this month, the Ghostbusters cast appeared with Clinton as guests on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
Tradition can be blinding …
If you've ever done something better than everyone else — especially for 103 years — the idea of starting over, reinventing how you do it, and getting everyone excited about rebuilding from scratch sounds impossible or even misguided.
Ideas like these are the stuff of wayward dreamers rather than rational doers, right?
But disrupting itself is exactly what Mondelez International, makers of Oreo, tasked Lauren Fleischer to do with the cookie everyone loves to dunk.
Much of the infrastructure would need to be built from scratch. So would the supply chain and logistics.
For the first time ever, Mondelez wanted to sell Oreo cookies directly to consumers by offering a unique customized packaging. And, it all had to be done in just a few weeks …
“There were thousands of reasons this could fail,” Fleischer recalls. “Initially, we saw a lot of ‘negative brainstorming' with people listing everything that could go wrong. We had to turn that thinking upside down. Instead of simply listing risks, we had to find a way to embrace and solve every potential problem.”
It's what Fleischer would soon discover about Oreo packaging that would make the task seem even more impossible.
The Trending Vending Machine
It's hard to teach an old brand-new tricks.
But years before Mondelez even thought about selling Oreos direct to consumers, the company could sense a shift in consumer behavior.
Gone were the days of patient consumers willing to accept what companies create for the masses. In was the on-demand, real-time, and personalized world made possible by technology and revolutionized by a burning desire to stand out rather than blend in.
Today's consumer is much different from the one buying Oreos a century ago.
“Brands either have to adapt or become irrelevant,” Fleischer concedes. “Selling via ecommerce is not just another channel, it's a new way to do business and a whole new way for us to sell.”
Mondelez first dipped its toes into customization two years earlier at the South by Southwest festival and conference.
To test whether Oreo might be able to capitalize on trends like on-demand 3D-like manufacturing and customization, Oreo set up a cookie making tool it dubbed The Trending Vending Machine.
The machine allowed people to create their own Oreo cookie based on things that were trending on Twitter. Each trend corresponded to a particular flavor combination and allowed for more than 10,000 custom combinations. The personalized Oreo would then be created as the Oreo lover watched.
“People stood in line two hours for a chance to create their own Oreo cookie,” Fleischer says. “The team knew right then that there was something to this trend toward customization.”
The problem was figuring out how to scale such a dynamic B2C offering. Even more challenging; doing it in just two months …
The Oreo War Room
Oreo is the premier brand at Mondelez and has a history of marketing opportunistically and in real time.
Remember the blackout during the 2013 Superbowl when Oreo knocked it out of the social media park with its Dunk In The Dark tweet? It's an example of an agile marketing team with an uncanny ability to capitalize on real-time branding opportunities that are still praised years later.
But building a B2C startup practically overnight is a challenge even this team wondered if it could pull off.
This is a project that normally would have taken us two years, but we had this entire project set up in just two months. Valerie Moens, Corporate Affairs at Mondelez International
It started with the formation of a team.
Fleischer was the project lead and began plucking the best and brightest from Mondelez; ecommerce talent, marketers, packaging designers, as well as help from several agency partners.
“We were building a business from scratch,” Fleischer says.
Next, came the formation of a dream.
In what came to be known as The Oreo War Room, Fleischer and her team battled over ideas and whether they could be done in the few months allotted for the project. “It got heated at times,” Fleischer admits. “We basically locked ourselves in there for a week until we figured out a way to say, ‘Yes. We can make this happen.'”
What emerged was a vision dubbed Oreo Colorfilled, a nod to the momentum built from the WonderFilled marketing campaign of the prior two years urging cookie lovers to unlock moments of childhood wonder with Oreo.
The idea was to allow Oreo lovers to personalize their experience with the brand by building their own Oreo packaging on a special website just in time for Christmas.
The plan would call for a series of firsts: the first time …
Oreo had been sold direct to consumer (D2C)
Oreo packaging would be completely customizable
Consumers could add a personal message to the wrapper
The team worked with artists to create a black and white design consumers could use as a canvas. Users are able to zoom in or out as they pleased to include or exclude specific characters.
Users can add their favorite color to the packaging, top their Oreo with a holiday-themed accessory, and include a personal message on the package:
Each package is unique, no two are exactly the same, there are an infinite number of combinations.
“The Oreo tool is just fun to play with,” Fleischer adds. “It's also a really good example of a big brand being nimble, moving fast, and creating something from scratch very quickly.”
The plan was a good one. The goal was to launch the customization project in approximately two months.
Too bad Fleischer and the team had no way to package, ship, or accept payment for their custom Oreo packages.
Finding the Perfect Oreo Colorfilled Factory
Mondelez makes millions of Oreo cookies a day. But it has never made them like this …
Ordinarily, Oreo packages come twelve per box. Remember, Mondelez is a B2B company and has perfected supply chain management and bulk shipping methods that allow it to benefit from efficiencies of scale. Afterward, Mondelez relies on retail business partners for the final leg of distribution.
The Oreo Colorfilled project meant bypassing all of this infrastructure and institutional knowledge to begin anew.
This really went against our grain, we just weren't equipped to make and ship custom orders directly to consumers.
Fleischer and her team couldn't even make custom orders at the company's existing facilities. It's why the crew had to find a brand-new place to manufacture, package, and ship the B2C orders.
The Colorfilled team quickly found a warehouse with potential. Two weeks later the warehouse had been transformed into an Oreo cookie factory almost ready for its first ever foray into ecommerce.
Almost …
“We had to fully change our supply chain,” Fleischer says. “Instead of shipping twelve packages to a box, we had to retool so we could ship one package to one customer.”
The packaging itself, the very portion of the experience that empowered customer customization, would prove to be an obstacle. “Each package needed to contain and protect 36 perfect cookies,” Fleischer says.
If Oreo lovers were going to go invest time and energy in designing their own packaging and be willing to pay more for the joy of doing so, Mondelez had to be sure the packaging would be strong enough to protect the cookies from potentially rough rides in FedEx trucks.
The company also had to ensure the packaging would be cost-effective...
Luckily, a Mondelez packaging engineer sacrificed an entire weekend to save the project. Not only did she design and hand cut a new box that was sure to protect and impress, but she reduced the cost of manufacturing the box by 77%.
The custom Oreo packages were ready to ship safely and cost effectively.
Problem solved! That is until Fleischer and the Colorfilled team encountered a brand-new problem they had never experienced before...
An Ecommerce Solution
“It's extremely scary thinking about accepting payments,” Fleischer says. “We were worried we wouldn't be able to finish the project on time because we weren't able to accept payments direct from customers.”
To sell direct to consumers, Mondelez would need a partner it could trust to protect credit card numbers and personal information belonging to customers. Mondelez had never before required Oreo lovers to provide payment and personal information.
Not only did the Colorfilled team need a partner that could provide a safe and easy checkout experience, it also needed an ecommerce platform that would allow each customer to create a unique product in real time.
To meet both needs, Mondelez chose Shopify Plus, a cloud-based enterprise ecommerce solutions provider for high volume merchants.
It was a relief when Shopify showed us all of the ways it protects the personal information belonging to customers, our onboarding representative, Brian Donohue, has been so patient with us and helpful in alleviating our concerns.
Besides a seamless checkout, the Shopify Plus interface provided Mondelez the ability to offer a level of customization that surprised some within the company. The API offered a set of tools that helped Mondelez offer a functional yet flexible way for consumers to personalize their experience with the Oreo brand.
“You can really customize with Shopify because its API is like no other,” Fleischer boasts. “Every time a package is customized it's like the customer is making a unique product that we have to build on the fly. Not only does Shopify provide us with the functionality we need, but the Oreo packaging tool is also fun to play with.”
To be able to create thousands of unique SKUs that easily, it was a really powerful value unlock and a reinvention of how we sell that was worth celebrating.
The Launch: ‘My phone was dying every 15 minutes'
“It might be selfish but I was actually Colorfilled's first customer,” Fleischer admits with a grin. “I was the first order and sent the first customized Oreo package to my mom and dad!”
It had been a long sleepless night before that first order though.
Prior to the official launch, Fleischer and her team had stayed awake much of the weekend improving the site, adding functionality, and designing the best user experience possible under the time constraints.
It wasn't perfect and it would still need to optimized, but — when the team officially launched Colorfilled — it figured it could finally rest after an exhausting two-month sprint.
“But it was such an adrenaline rush there was no way I could go to sleep,” Fleischer says.
Equally impossible for Fleischer would be to remain a bystander as the orders began coming in at the Oreo factory she had helped create. “There is absolutely nothing more satisfying than that first order,” Fleischer recalls. “I was actually in the plant packaging orders myself and it was incredible actually seeing them in the boxes we made just for this.”
The orders were coming in so rapidly Fleischer actually had to deactivate the push notifications the Shopify app was sending her phone for each order. “We were getting so many orders my phone was dying every 15 minutes.”
If it seems as if Fleischer and the Colorfilled team were in ecommerce heaven, things were even better for some of the Oreo die-hards creating custom packaging.
In fact, some of the personal messages customers were adding to their customized packages were stunning:
Marriage proposals
Pregnancy announcements
Heartfelt messages to parents
Oreo's customization project was quickly turning into something much bigger; an opportunity for the brand to play a role in major life events that would be remembered and revered for lifetimes.
“People who love Oreo are co-creating with the brand in ways they never have before,” Fleischer says. “We're so excited by the response and seeing this level of creativity from consumers.”
A Fearless Future
“We have a mantra around here and it's all about being fearless,” Fleischer says proudly. “We market fearlessly which means we're disrupting the status quo to accelerate growth in ways that are also meaningful to customers.”
That fearlessness is what inspired the Colorfilled team to compete against its century-old parent company and create a brand new D2C experience customers just can't get in a store.
The Colorfilled campaign has become a guide for future ecommerce growth at the company.
“We have huge ecommerce ambitions,” Fleischer teases. “I have never worked on a project that unlocked this level of childhood joy before. I'm exhaustedly energized because we've overcome so much but aren't resting on our laurels. Doing this just makes us want to do more and do it even better.”
Disrupting a successful company from within, especially one with such a rich tradition, and building a startup culture from scratch is a risky and scary prospect.
It's one thing to tell the world you're fearless. It's another to actually prove it with your cookies.
Proposed changes would bring bitcoin, dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies under definition of currency
Japan's governing Liberal Democratic party is planning to propose legal changes that would define bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as currencies.
The changes would mean bitcoin could be more tightly regulated and taxed, and are likely to lead to more investment in developing cryptocurrency infrastructure in Japan.
Tomonori Kanda, an official in the financial affairs section at the party's headquarters, said legislative changes were discussed on Wednesday and the LDP aimed to raise the matter in parliament.
“There is a long way to go,” he said. “But we have discussed reform and believe it is the right way to go.” The timing of the change was yet to be decided, he said.
Brace yourself for a cyber-tsunami – the six biggest waves of change about to hit the world Read more
Japan considers bitcoin a commodity. The new definition would consider anything that can be exchanged for goods and services or legal tender as a currency, bringing bitcoin, dogecoin and many other cryptocurrencies into the fold.
According to a report in the Nikkei newspaper, the changes were proposed by government body the Financial Services Agency. However, an FSA official in Tokyo refused to confirm that any changes to legislation were being considered.
“We have not decided anything yet,” the official said. “The way things work here is that any change would have to be approved by parliament first, and then we would work on writing the legislation.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, the official declined to comment on whether the FSA had proposed the legislative changes.
Japan, the home of Mt. Gox, the bitcoin exchange that folded in 2014 and lost coins worth hundreds of millions of pounds, has been looking for ways to keep a closer eye on cryptocurrencies and prevent another disaster.
Mark Karpeles, the former chief executive of Mt. Gox, is being held by Japanese authorities and has been charged with embezzlement.
British embassy employee Hossein Rassam is accused of spying
European nations have strongly criticised the latest trials in Iran over the unrest that followed the disputed presidential poll.
Iranian workers at the French and British embassies and a French national were among dozens of detainees to appear in court in Tehran.
The EU presidency said action against any EU national or embassy would be seen as an act against the whole bloc.
The UK and France also spoke out against the trial.
This is the second group trial of those accused of taking part in the mass protests that erupted after the 12 June election.
Last week more than 100 people, including leading reformers, appeared in court in Tehran on charges including conspiracy.
'Spying for foreigners'
The group that appeared in court in Tehran on Saturday included reformist lawmakers and journalists, all wearing grey prison clothes.
They are accused of crimes including rioting, spying and plotting to overthrow the government.
Hossein Rassam, the most senior Iranian employee at the British embassy, stands accused of "spying for foreigners".
Prosecutors accuse him of monitoring the riots on the ground along with two UK diplomats who have since been expelled.
An Iranian employee of the French embassy, Nazak Afshar, was also in the dock, as was 24 year-old French teacher Clotilde Reiss.
She has been charged with acting against national security by joining protests and gathering information.
Iranian state media reported that all three apologised to the court for their actions.
European nations reacted with anger. "This is obviously a show trial directed against the EU," Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told Reuters news agency.
The Swedish EU presidency said the trial was an act against the entire bloc.
"Actions against one EU country, citizen or embassy staff is considered an action against all of the EU, and will be treated accordingly," it said in a statement.
British Foreign Minister David Miliband criticised what he called "unjustified charges" against a member of embassy staff "going about his legitimate duties".
France's Foreign Ministry described charges against Ms Reiss as "devoid of foundation". Ones against Nazak Afshar were "non-existent", it said.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says it is now up to the EU whether they can agree new diplomatic measures, such as the withdrawal of ambassadors, or perhaps new financial sanctions.
At least 30 people were killed in the violence that followed the 12 June poll.
Official results gave victory to incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but the opposition says the poll was rigged.
The Iranian government has accused Western nations of fuelling the violence.
Human rights groups say the Iranian government has detained hundreds of reformers, journalists and opposition supporters since the poll.
Mr Ahmadinejad was sworn in earlier this week, but a number of top Iranian officials did not attend.
Strong US auto loan performance and fewer banks easing underwriting terms are among the highlights from Fitch Ratings' latest auto loan asset quality report.
While underwriting terms remain eased relative to historical standards, recent Federal Reserve senior loan officer survey data showed that just 3.3% of net respondents eased underwriting standards in the second quarter of 2015. This compares with 14% of net respondents who eased standards in the July 2013 survey. Although Fitch views this positively, as long as terms continue to be relatively relaxed, newer loan vintages will continue to underperform earlier ones, eventually leading asset quality to revert to historical averages over the medium term.
An improving employment picture, steadier economic conditions and falling gas prices are contributing to robust auto sales. These same factors could push new vehicle sales in the US to break 17 million units for the first calendar year since 2001. Fitch believes that high levels of competition between major auto lenders will still result in further easing of terms, lower FICOs and new entrants into subprime lending over the near term, despite the decreased pace of easing.
Auto loans are expected to remain one of the faster growing asset classes for US banks and other financial institutions. The July Fed loan survey showed that over second quarter of 2015, loan officers seeing an increase in auto loan demand exceeded those seeing decreases by a margin of 18%. Macroeconomic factors that correlate with auto loan performance, such as unemployment, also point to the market remaining robust. That said, competitive underwriting conditions, combined with potential future pressure on auto residual values and consumers' ability to continue to service their personal debt obligations in a rising rate environment, could push the market toward weaker asset quality over the medium term.
Currently however, despite competition, US auto lenders are still enjoying generally strong asset quality through the first half of 2015. Year-over-year performance for the top nine Fitch-rated auto lenders was mixed, reflecting the continued easing of underwriting standards, higher subprime lending and a decline in used car values in recent periods. However, prime loans saw improvements that were attributable to better consumer discretionary spending -- a seasonal effect typical in the first half of the calendar year following year-end consumer spending surges.
Fitch's prime Auto ABS index performance remained solid, while Fitch's subprime auto ABS index experienced a 47% increase in annualized net losses to 5.44% in second-quarter 2015. Nonetheless, the subprime auto loan index still remains well below peak recessionary levels in late 2008 to early 2009.
The top nine Fitch-rated auto lenders, including captives, held about $473 billion of auto loans at the end of June 2015. Of the nine, only General Motors Financial and Capital One have any meaningful subprime exposure in their loan portfolios.
Quebec is again taking steps aimed at barring public servants from wearing face-covering religious garments at work, and preventing members of the public from covering their faces while receiving government services.
However, Bill 62 – the neutrality bill tabled Wednesday in the National Assembly – doesn't go as far as the previous Parti Québécois government's efforts to ban all religious symbols.The province would accommodate those symbols under certain conditions.
"We don't judge people for their beliefs or absence of beliefs," said Quebec Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée.
"We are convinced the way we are approaching this is respectful and will be a plus for society."
According to the bill, titled the "Act to foster adherence to state religious neutrality and, in particular, to provide a framework for religious accommodation requests in certain bodies," officials could refuse an accommodation request for security or identification reasons.
Feds to follow Quebec's lead
Canada's Multiculturalism Minister, Tim Uppal, weighed in on Bill 62.
"We broadly support Quebec's legislation regarding the uncovering of faces for giving and receiving public services," Uppal told reporters after the Conservative caucus met on Parliament Hill.
Uppal said the Conservatives will table a last-minute bill -- just before the session ends for the summer -- that is similar to Quebec's but would be more limited in scope.
"Our government will be moving forward in the coming days with legislation with respect to the face coverings at citizenship ceremonies, and we will consider what other measures may be necessary," the minister said.
Two bills tabled at National Assembly
The neutrality bill was one of two, tabled Wednesday in Quebec City by the provincial justice minister, on the most controversial issues facing the Liberal government.
Vallée also tabled Bill 59, aimed at fighting hate speech.
She said Bill 59 would establish a new process to report any cases of hate speech or speech inciting violence to the Quebec Human Rights Commission.
The proposed legislation would also give that tribunal new responsibilities and new investigative powers concerning hate speech, she said.
The legislation also permits the creation of an online list containing names of anyone convicted of promoting hate.
The Blue Jays and Angels are in completely different positions — the Jays would make the playoffs if the season ended today, while the Angels are out of contention. Yet, as the two teams approached the nonwaiver deadline, they had similar concerns.
Neither club had many prospects to trade, and neither wanted to overpay for mediocre free-agent starting pitching — pretty much the only kind that will be available this offseason.
The separate predicaments led to separate trades Monday that at first glance made little sense. But dig deeper, and the logic behind the Jays' acquisition of left-hander Francisco Liriano, whose 5.46 ERA is the third-worst in the majors, and the Angels' pickup of righty Ricky Nolasco, whose 5.13 ERA is the 11th worst, becomes clearer.
Article continues below ...
Both pitchers are under contract through 2017, which should help the Jays and Angels avoid signing equally dubious starters at higher salaries in free agency. The other potential benefit is the young talent that came in the trades; the Jays and Angels required it in return for taking on the struggling veterans.
The Jays, while absorbing the remaining $18 million on Liriano's contract, also obtained two of the Pirates' better prospects, outfielder Harold Ramirez and catcher Reese McGuire.
The Angels pulled off a similar feat, acquiring the upside of righty Alex Meyer by parting with left-hander Hector Santiago, a pitcher who is superior to Nolasco.
The deals hardly are without risk, particularly for the Jays. Liriano soon will take the rotation spot of All-Star righty Aaron Sanchez, who will shift to the bullpen in an effort to limit his innings. If Liriano cannot return to form, he not only might harm the Jays' chances this season, but also could cause additional damage in 2017.
The Pirates, who excel at fixing pitchers, gave up on Liriano rather than try to revive him again. The Jays believe that Liriano's stuff is still good, that reuniting him with catcher Russell Martin and changing leagues might help him restore his declining chase rate. What's more, they did not make this move in a vacuum.
No, the Jays made two other trades on Monday — righty Jesse Chavez to the Dodgers for righty Mike Bolsinger and Class A right-hander Lupe Chavez to the Astros for righty Scott Feldman. Feldman is a bullpen upgrade over Chavez, and Bolsinger replaces righty Drew Hutchison, who went to the Pirates in the Liriano trade, as Class AAA insurance. Either could enter the rotation, if necessary.
The other “addition,” if you want to call it that, will be Sanchez as a reliever. The Jays could still use another left-handed specialist, but they have overhauled their bullpen since the start of the season, adding veteran righties Jason Grilli, Joaquin Benoit and now Feldman. Sanchez will be a bigger weapon than all of them, and using him in relief will enable him to make an impact through Game 7 of the World Series, if necessary.
The Jays, according to a major-league source, were “relentless” in their pursuit of Athletics left-hander Rich Hill, who ultimately went to the Dodgers, and also discussed acquiring other starters. In the end, they settled on Liriano, knowing that he has the potential to be part of their playoff rotation and a better option for one year and $13 million next season than free agents such as Brett Anderson and Andrew Cashner.
The Jays' series of moves required payroll flexibility — the team's lead executives, team president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins, flexed the financial muscle they never had in Cleveland, adding more than $12 million in payroll for this season with the additions of Liriano, Feldman and outfielder Melvin Upton Jr.

The Angels' trade with the Twins, on the other hand, was entirely cash-neutral — the Twins are accounting for the difference in salaries between Nolasco and Santiago both this season and next, and paying the $1 million buyout on his 2018 club option.
From the Angels' perspective, the trade was mostly about Meyer, who was the Nationals' first-round pick in 2011 and got traded straight-up for center fielder Denard Span in Nov. 2012, but at 26 has yet to come close to fulfilling his promise.
Righty Alan Busenitz, the prospect that the Angels sent to the Twins as part of the 2-for-2 exchange, might even prove to be a better major leaguer than Meyer. But the Angels placed such a high value on Meyer's upside, they were willing to accept the downgrade from Santiago to Nolasco.
The exchange does not figure to help the Angels' rotation in '17; the question is, will it even matter? The Angels are unlikely to contend next season. If Nolasco's ERA is 0.50 or 0.75 higher than Santiago's, what difference will it make?
Oh, the Angels are not about to concede ‘17; they likely will seek to upgrade this offseason at second base, left field and possibly catcher. But like the Jays, they intend to steer clear of the free-agent starters. In fact, the Angels are so opposed to rewarding veteran mediocrity, they might even try some of their young relievers as starters next spring.
GM Billy Eppler, after inheriting the game's lowest-ranked farm system, needs to be creative, take an occasional risk. His gamble on Meyer amounts to a swing for the fences, but the possibility exists that he will hit a home run. The primary cost if Meyer flops will be the difference in performance between Santiago and Nolasco, and perhaps the loss of Busenitz. Again, there are no payroll consequences with this deal.
No one should be surprised if the trades by the Angels and Jays fail to produce the desired results; the risks are that significant. But give both teams credit for trying. Facing difficult circumstances, they brainstormed, they improvised, they developed alternate solutions.
CAIRO (AP) — An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced the head of the journalists' union and two of its board members to two years in prison and a 10,000 pounds (around $650) fine each for harboring two wanted journalists.
The ruling against Yahia Qalash, the head of Egypt's press union, and board members Khaled el-Balshy and Gamal Abdel-Rahem, comes after a seven-month trial.
The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the conviction, saying the ruling is a "punishment" and called upon authorities to ensure that journalists work without "fear of reprisal."
The case goes back to April when the security forces raided the syndicate to arrest two journalists, who were wanted over protests against the president's decision to transfer Egyptian sovereignty of two strategic Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia.
The move infuriated journalists. They staged protests and demanded the interior minister's resignation, as well as a presidential apology. Instead, Qalash and two others were detained and charged for harboring the wanted men inside the press syndicate building.
Following the verdict, heavy security forces were deployed to the headquarters of the syndicate in downtown Cairo, amid calls for protests. Later in the day, dozens of journalists staged a sit-in outside the syndicate and chanted slogans, such as: "Are we in a state or a jungle?"
Courts have since struck down and annulled el-Sissi's decision to transfer the islands to Saudi Arabia.
Also on Saturday, a Giza Court sentenced in absentia three TV presenters to three years in prison each, on charges of spreading false news, disturbing public safety, and inciting sectarian tension. The three TV hosts, Mohammed Nasser, Moatz Matar, and Hisham Abdullah, are vocal el-Sissi critics and believed to be pro-Islamist. Their TV shows appear on el-Sharq network, which is said to be financed by Qatar and aired from Turkey. Turkey and Qatar are rivals of Egypt's el-Sissi, giving refuge to leaders and members of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood group, from which ousted President Morsi hails.
Defendants tried in absentia in Egypt typically receive maximum penalties, but receive an automatic retrial usually ending with lighter sentences if they turn themselves in.
The crackdown on press and speech freedoms intensified under Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military ouster of the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.
Many journalists and TV hosts were banned from appearing on TV, deported, or had their shows canceled. Reporters and photographers were arrested, detained, and tried over alleged links to Islamists. El-Sissi has been intolerant of criticism in the press and repeatedly said that stability and national security were a prerequisite for democracy.
The tight security grip might have proven effective in preventing large-scale violence from reaching central Cairo, however smaller, low-level attacks have persisted.
Elsewhere, a six-year-old child was killed Saturday and a second injured when a home-made bomb exploded in the child's apartment in Cairo's slum district of Menshiyat Nasr, where the city's garbage collectors work.
The Interior Ministry identified the child as Abanoub Milad, and said he found the "ball-shaped improvised bomb" while playing with his friend and brought it back to the apartment. It wasn't immediately clear where the bomb came from or who manufactured it.

A parent of a Texas high school football player whose team ended up on the wrong end of a 91-0 rout has filed a bullying report against the winning team's head coach, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
Aledo coach Tim Buchanan said he received notice that a bullying report had been filed against him by a parent of an opposing player following the Bearcats' 91-0 win over Fort Worth Western Hills on Friday.
Aledo, a three-time Class 4A state champion, is ranked No. 1 in The Associated Press statewide poll. The Bearcats have outscored their opponents by an average of 77 points in each of their four district games, including 84-7 wins over Fort Worth Arlington Heights and Fort Worth Wyatt.

Buchanan told the Star-Telegram the margins of victory are troublesome for him and his coaching staff.
“I'm upset about it,” Buchanan said. “I don't like it. I sit there the whole third and fourth quarter and try to think how I can keep us from scoring.”
Aledo rushed for 391 yards and eight touchdowns against Western Hills. One running back scored four touchdowns on four carries. Aledo quarterbacks attempted just 10 passes. Aledo also dominated Western Hills in special teams play, with one player returning consecutive punt returns for touchdowns.
Buchanan told the Star-Telegram he removed his offensive starters after 21 plays and both teams agreed to use a running clock in the second half.
It's believed to be the first time a bullying report has been filed involving a Texas high school football game.

From the Star-Telegram:
By state law, Aledo and all school districts must provide a bullying report form on their website. Aledo's principal has to investigate the allegations reported and prepare a written report of the investigation, determining whether bullying occurred. Buchanan said he has the support of the Aledo administration. But he didn't dismiss the serious nature of the report. “I have to address it,” Buchanan said. “It's not something you can laugh off or anything like that. What they said was that I should've told my players to ease up and not play so hard.”
Western Hills coach John Naylor told the Star-Telegram on Sunday that he was unaware of the report, and disagreed with the allegations. His team entered the Aledo game outmanned, dressing about 30 varsity players.
“I think the game was handled fine,” Naylor said. “They're No. 1 for a reason, and I know coach Buchanan. We're fighting a real uphill battle right now.”
It all started when I was asked (as a freelancer) to configure exim4, so that newsletters would not fall into spam folders. They even sent me a link to a tutorial.
I thought the work would take a couple of hours, including the DNS update, but I was wrong. After logging in as root, I started my favorite screen by running the screen -x command as usual, and watched a curious scene in the favorite for many of you /dev/shm folder. The attacker either did not bother to close the screen session, or was still working in it. That's where the quest begins:
The first thing I did was looking at the things the attacker was doing:
wget http://ravenul.zzl.org/it/noi/up/8.txt mv 8.txt list.txt php lol.php php lol.php netstat -an | grep :22 w rm -rf list.txt w rm -rf .x netstat -an | grep :22
Apparently, he sent out spam and ran some .x file (or was it a directory?). He checked the ssh connection and there was also an archive with the php script lol.php that I, unfortunately, forgot to save.
The output of last and who commands did not show anything special, there were no root sessions during the month, and the owner of the server confirmed this. However…
$ lsof -ni | grep ssh Showed the established connection with the IP 172.190.125.14, that I killed right away.
I paid attention to /usr/sbin/sshd
$ ls -la /usr/sbin/sshd -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 320724 Oct 11 23:29 /usr/sbin/sshd
There was sshd0 next to sshd
$ ls -la /usr/sbin/sshd0 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 757356 Jul 31 2010 /usr/sbin/sshd0
File removal took me nowhere:
$ rm -f /usr/sbin/sshd rm: cannot remove `/usr/sbin/sshd': Operation not permitted
Let's move on:
$ lsattr /usr/sbin/sshd -u--ia------------- /usr/sbin/sshd $ chattr -aui /usr/sbin/sshd $ rm /usr/sbin/sshd $ lsattr /usr/bin/* | grep -v -- '-------------------' -u--ia------------- /usr/bin/ssh $ chattr -aui /usr/bin/ssh $ rm /usr/bin/ssh
I reinstall openssh-server and openssh-client. All seems good, there's no threat anymore, and nothing suspicious was found. I decided to update the system, besides, tzdata was quite old.
I checked /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.d. All the files were fine, there were no unusual strings, the dates had not been changed for about a year. After apt-get update, I applied all the security updates on Debian Lenny, including new kernel. Now, we need to reboot. I request the KVM just in case (and it was the right thing to do), and waited.
The next day the KVM was provided. I typed reboot and I got dozens of segmentation faults. My hair started to turn gray, hands were shaking. I guess you can imagine the situation. As they say, “Don't TOUCH it when everything works”, but after detecting the break-in, I had to apply updates and reboot.
To cut the long story short, I pulled myself together and decided to find out what was wrong and logged in as a single user mode. The mount command leads to the segmentation fault after each call, even without any parameters. The file system is readonly and there's nothing we can do about it. /etc/fstab is fine, df operates as well. Somehow, the date command also leads to the segmentation fault. I run the fsck.ext3 /dev/md0 disk check (raid1). Everything is okay, no abnormalities found. What's the matter then? That's when I start to think that I am the one to break the system down after I updated the tzdata package that is connected with time. At this very moment, the DSL connection with my provided is lost. Reboot the modem — the connection returns. Great!
The server owner is angry, as the server has been down for several hours. He decides to write a ticket to the support, while I keep examining the system. The most adequate solution to my mind seems to reboot the system and log in with liveusb, so that the disk would be RW. I begin to debug mount using available techniques. gdb is not installed, but I have ldd. It did not show anything interesting. I also used export LD_DEBUG=all, but it did not find anything special either. The segfault happens after the initialization of all the libraries. That's when KVM told me that it had been disabled. Got it — the support put their hands on. I stepped away from the laptop and started to think more…
While standing and breathing the fresh air, the following thought comes to my mind: «What if the files that cause the segmentation fault are spoofed?». No sooner said than done. So, there I am waiting for what the client is going to say about the ticket to the support. A few minutes later he sends me the response:
The partition table has been damaged. It's impossible to restore it by using rapid methods. We can engage our system administrators for recovery. You can also do it yourself. In this case, we recommend using Gpart (http://packages.debian.org/en/sid/gpart).
WTF?! I tell the client that it's not the case, as fsck has performed the disk check and has not found any violations in the file system. While the client is writing his answer to the support team, the access to KVM returns and I watch the same futile attempts to call mount, hdparm, that are not installed in the system. I also see some fdisk calls.
The latter outputs the following:
$ fdisk -l Disk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes 255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19457 cylinders Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes Disk identifier: 0x000f0571 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/sda1 1 18480 148440568+ fd Linux raid autodetect /dev/sda2 18481 19457 7847752+ fd Linux raid autodetect Disk /dev/sdb: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes 255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19457 cylinders Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes Disk identifier: 0x00000000 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/sdb1 * 1 18480 148440568+ fd Linux raid autodetect /dev/sdb2 18481 19457 7847752+ fd Linux raid autodetect Disk /dev/md0: 152.0 GB, 152003018752 bytes 2 heads, 4 sectors/track, 37110112 cylinders Units = cylinders of 8 * 512 = 4096 bytes Disk identifier: 0x00000000 Disk /dev/md0 doesn't contain a valid partition table Disk /dev/md1: 8036 MB, 8036024320 bytes 2 heads, 4 sectors/track, 1961920 cylinders Units = cylinders of 8 * 512 = 4096 bytes Disk identifier: 0x00000000 Disk /dev/md1 doesn't contain a valid partition table
Basing on the last Disk /dev/md0 doesn't contain a valid partition table, the support concluded that the problem was in the partition table. Oh, really? fdisk never saw the partition table of the software raid. I send all my thoughts to the client and begin to develop the cunning plan. I can only imagine how the support story would end and how much time it would take if the client accepted their help.
I look at the modification date of the /bin/mount. It's the time of the last server's boot. Rebooting again and check the date one more time. It's the time of the last server's boot. Strange. This means that something modifies this file during the boot and I should do something about this “something”.
/tmp is readonly. To upload the file to the server, I need a file system with write access. That's when I remember about /dev/shm. I bring the interface up, assign an IP address, and download deb mount package for lenny. Unpack and run it, and voila! It works! I remount the file system and it's RW now. Things got rolling!
Checking files in /bin/, I see the following:
$ ls -latr /bin -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 96408 Nov 15 18:11 vdir -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 30896 Nov 15 18:11 pwd -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 30712 Nov 15 18:11 ping6 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 24252 Nov 15 18:11 nc.traditional -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 8612 Nov 15 18:11 mountpoint -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 68208 Nov 15 18:11 mount -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 32244 Nov 15 18:11 mknod -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 39144 Nov 15 18:11 loadkeys -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 17244 Nov 15 18:11 kill -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 9764 Nov 15 18:11 fgconsole -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 26216 Nov 15 18:11 false -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 8524 Nov 15 18:11 dmesg -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 96408 Nov 15 18:11 dir -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 51988 Nov 15 18:11 dd -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 59148 Nov 15 18:11 date -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 49440 Nov 15 18:11 chgrp -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 30956 Nov 15 18:11 cat -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 12252 Nov 15 18:11 bzip2recover
The modification date of files changes every 3 minutes and 10 seconds. Start to look though crontabs and find nothing there. lsof does not help me to catch the process that changes files. Printing ps auxww, I see that some cat /sys/class/net/lo/operstate process is hanging there.
I download the package with the kill utility, rename the /bin/cat в /bin/cat_ file and kill the process. Files are no longer being modified. Bingo! Now, I should replace all the modified files with the original ones. So I download the necessary packages and install them via dpkg -i *deb (after checking the creation date of the dpkg file). After all the changes made, I type reboot and watch the KVM window, fingers crossed. The boot is successful, the website works. Next, I scan the infected files that I copied, using clamav, and detect Linux.RST.B-1 FOUND. Who is there to say that there are no viruses under Linux? By the way, the virus is dated to 12/21/2001…
Scanning sshd and ssh does not give anything. Apparently it's about the modified ssh and sshd. The former one is likely to send the login and password when successfully connected to the server, while the latter one likely allows to connect to the server for everyone with a specific password.
P.S. If there's anything wrong with the commands, then I apologize; I wrote many of them from memory. I did not feel like configuring exim4 anymore. Also, I did not ask for money. But what would he pay me for? I did not finish the main task anyway :)
The other night, on DL Show episode 51, I joked that we'd know everything about the “All New HTC One” (or HTC One 2014) long before its official arrival because there would be at least two or three unofficial reviews of the phone. In other words, HTC is terrible at keeping their devices a secret. Sure enough, we aren't but four days removed from that statement and a 12-minute video review or overview of the AT&T model from some kid in Schaumburg, IL has appeared on YouTube (if you can call this a review). That's right, we have an entire 12-minute session with HTC's new flagship a full three and a half weeks ahead of their planned unveiling event in NYC.
So what can we see? Well, outside of this kid failing to hide his identity over and over again, we're still digging through it all since it is such an exhaustingly long video. But so far we have been shown an SD card slot, listened to Soulja Boy (wtf?), seen a body that matches up exactly to the render leaks, slight tweaks to Sense in whatever new version this is (leaker says “6.6” but it's probably Sense 6.0), all sorts of views of the new camera UI (which is super buggy because it's a dev unit), and a pure look at those on-screen buttons.
Update: We tossed in a massive gallery below the video, but you'll see that there are most definitely dual rear cameras, the power has moved to the top right side, headphone jack to the bottom, and Sense mostly looks the same. The camera has been really simplified to a shutter button and an options button that will let you choose between six modes: Camera, Video, Selfie, Zoe, 360 Panoramas, and Dual Capture. The overall color scheme, or at least the accents around the UI, seem tweaked slightly to green, and BlinkFeed looks more flattened or modern.
Update 2: Annnnnd video pulled. The leaker is now back-tracking on Twitter, saying that it's not a real phone after the world (and HTC reps) told him how much trouble he would be in. Something seems off. I guess we'll know before long.
Update 3: The video is live again. Who knows for how long.
Update 4: Private again. I give up. Head to the comments if you want to watch.
I'd say HTC will have some extra tricks up their sleeves, but this gives us a bit of a primer before we get to March 25.
We'll update this post as we have more, but for now, watch along with us. Also, feel free to suggest job openings to this kid's parents, who he likely just cost a job.

Firebase with Clojure & core.async
You love Firebase? I love Firebase.
WARNING: Fun with transducers ahead. Note that the use of transducers could have been totally avoided, but what's the point if we're not having a little fun, right? right?
Firebase has made client side web-apps development trivial for me. I can forget about managing my data, pushing it, sanitizing it (may be a little) and retrieving it. These things may seem simple but having them taken care for you puts you in a different State of Mind which takes that data management burden out of your thought process.
I've been working on a Firebase Clojure library called pani (hindi word for water). Things are flowing (no pun intended) nicely, although Clojure support is lagging behind ClojureScript (since I tend to use the latter more).
In this post I am going to touch on one aspect of pani. What I intend to do is write a function named listen which listens for events on Firebase refs and provides a nice way of dealing with them. We'd be using core.async to deliver these events.
I originally intended to deconstruct these delivered events using core.match , but it seems like core.async and core.match don't play nicely together yet.
First things first
The listen function will bind to Firebase events and wait for notifications. The function will return a core.async chan . Received Events will be posted to this channel as Clojure vectors. I will refrain from using certain functions from pani itself to make things clearer (although it could have resulted in more concise code).
I am not going to show you the requirements and stuff since this function will be a part of the pani library and requires have already been taken care of.
Basic Structure
I think the function should look something like:
( defn listen "Given a Firebase root and a key (or a seq of keys) return a channel which will deliver events" [ root korks ] ( let [ c ( chan )] c ))
The function takes a Firebase root (can be created with pani/root function and either a single key or a seq of keys). We just declare a chan for now and return it.
Let's build on it.
Listening for Firebase Events
Although pani already has functions to listen for Firebase events, let's just re-write them here using some transducers for extra giggles.
Mostly we're just interested in three Firebase events here: child_added , child_removed and child_changed (let's collectively decide to not worry about child_moved ). For most of my use cases I've found that I never need the previous snapshot or node name (let me know if that's not the case though, or I'll sooner or later hit one).
First, let's write a little function which takes a Firebase ref and returns to us a chan which will have the received value posted to it ( pani/bind does something similar) after It's passed through a provided transducer.
( defn- fb->chan "Given a firebase ref, an event and a transducer, binds and posts to returned channel" [ fbref event td ] ( let [ c ( chan 1 td )] ( .on fbref ( clojure.core/name event ) # ( put! c [ event % ])) c ))
This function takes a Firebase ref, an event in the form of a keyword e.g. :child_added and a transducer. The function pushes values as a vector into the channel. The values look like [event-type firebase-snapshot] , e.g. [:child_added #js {:firebase "stuff"}] (that #js is called a reader, basically saying what follows need to be interpreted as a javascript object, makes more sense when you're reading in code, hence the name).
The transducer then accepts this vector and turns it into a flattened out vector, something like [:child_added "key name" "value"] . Like I said before, we can totally not use a transducer here, but we're just having a little bit of fun.
Testing this is not a trivial thing to do, so you'd have to take my word for it that it's working fine. If you really want to test it, you can create a new ClojureScript application, refer to pani and play around with it. Hint: a good starting point for ClojureScript apps is David Nolen's mies.
listen Machinery
Once we have the fb->chan method, we can start defining our listen function. It looks something like this for me:
( defn listen "Listens for events on the given firebase ref" [ root korks ] ( let [ root ( walk-root root korks ) events [ :child_added :child_removed :child_changed ] td ( map ( fn [[ evt snap ]] [ evt ( .name snap ) ( .val snap )])) chans ( map ( fn [ event ] ( fb->chan root event td )) events )] ( merge chans )))
The function begins by taking care of any child refs we may need to get to using walk-root . This function works by walking up the refs, e.g.
"/" -> (walk-root [:hello :world]) -> "/hello/world"
Next we list the events we are interested in, followed by our transducer which pulls the Firebase snapshot's name and value out of the snapshot.
[:child_added #js {:name "1" :value "sup"}] -> [:child_added "1" "sup"]
A simple transformation.
Finally we map over our events of interest and generate chan s for each one of them using the fb->chan method.
We finally return a merged chan .
Using our new function
To begin with, let's just print what we receive.
( def r ( p/root "https://secret-app.firebaseio.com/" )) ( let [ c ( p/listen r [ :items ])] ( go-loop [ msg ( <! c )] ( println msg ) ( recur ( <! c ))))
We define r as the root of our Firebase app. We call listen on it and pass it [:items] , since here we're interested in /items ref. Any items added, removed or changed under this ref needs to be told us about. When I run this and simulate adding and removing values, I get output like this:
[:child_added "4" "clojure"] [:child_added "5" "rocks!"] [:child_changed "5" "rocks hard!"] [:child_removed "5" "rocks hard!"]
Ok, so far so good.
Let's say I want to keep track of values under my Firebase ref. I would start with an empty map and as I receive notifications about items being added, removed or modified, I would update my map accordingly. A nice and pretty way of doing this would be to use clojure.match , but we're going to stay away from it for now. Instead we'll play a little bit with multi-methods.
A whirlwind tour of Multi-methods
Multi-methods you say?
A mutli-method in its gist can be thought of as a dispatch table. Based on a certain value one of the defined methods of a multi-method will be called. This certain value is again computed by calling a function called a dispatch function. All arguments passed to the multi-method are passed to this dispatch function. The return value of the dispatch function then determines which of the functions from the dispatch table needs to be called.
Let's work on a simple example:
( defmulti greet :message ) ( defmethod greet :bye [ _ ] "Goodbye" ) ( defmethod greet :hello [ _ ] "Hello" )
Here we declare a multi-method named greet, the second parameter to defmulti is a function. Recall that a keyword can be called as a function on a map:
( :message { :message "what" }) => "what"
So It's totally fine to use a keyword as a dispatch function for a multi-method as long as you're expecting a map as the only parameter.
Next, we define two cases for calling the multi-method. This is done using the defmethod form. We're essentially telling Clojure which code to call for which return value of the dispatch function. When the dispatch function returns :bye return "Goodbye" and when it returns :hello , return "Hello" . Since, here, we don't really care about the arguments passed in we just use _ in parameter list. Read some more examples here. Let's test it out:
( greet { :message :bye }) => "Goodbye" ( greent { :message :hello }) => "Hello"
Mutli-methods are much broader in scope though, so if you find them interesting, read more about them. I've found that The Joy of Clojure has a pretty enlightening text on these.
Using multi-methods in our case
Before we write our mutli-method, let's try and see how we're going to use it.
( let [ c ( p/listen r [ :items ])] ( go-loop [ msg ( <! c ) my-data {}] ( let [ new-data ( handle-value msg my-data )] ( println "My data is now " new-data ) ( recur ( <! c ) new-data ))))
We're running a go-loop here listening for messages on channel c . We then pass the received message and the current value of my-data (our list of items) to our multi-method handle-value . handle-value is then supposed to return us the new state of our data.
We can define our multi-method like so:
( defmethod handle-value # ( first %1 )) ( defmethod handle-value :child_added [[ _ k v ] data ] ( assoc data k v )) ( defmethod handle-value :child_removed [[ _ k _ ] data ] ( dissoc data k )) ( defmethod handle-value :child_changed [[ _ k v ] data ] ( assoc data k v ))
We know that handle-value gets passed two arguments. The event type is the first element in the first argument. We pass a #(first %1) function as the dispatch function when defining the multi-method, which pulls the first element out of the first argument passed to the multi-method.
The defmethod form then defines the three situations we want to handle. These methods don't do much other than assoc ing and disassoc ing values into passed in data parameter.
Final output
When I hook up all of this machinery and run the code. I get output like this:
My data is now {2 do} ;; [:child_added "2" "do"] My data is now {3 even, 2 do} ;; [:child_added "3" "even"] My data is now {3 even, ;; [:child_added "4" "eat"] 4 eat, 2 do} My data is now {3 even, ;; [:child_added "5" "Hello"] 4 eat, 5 Helloes, 2 do} My data is now {3 events, ;; [:child_changed "3" "event"] 4 eat, 5 Helloes, 2 do} My data is now {3 events, ;; [:child_removed "4" "eat"] 5 Hello, 2 do} My data is now {3 events, ;; [:child_removed "2" "do"] 5 Hello}
Things look good.
Conclusion
Here are some of the things we discussed:
Until next time!
UPDATE on Congressional interest in this story here.
Shell Oil has been building and testing equipment designed for the Arctic Ocean here in Puget Sound. In September, a key test of underwater oil-spill equipment was a spectacular failure.
It forced the energy giant to postpone drilling into oil-bearing rocks beneath the Arctic Ocean until next summer. Shell and its federal regulators have been tight-lipped about the failed test.
But a freedom-of-information request reveals what happened beneath the surface of Puget Sound.
The final obstacle to Arctic drilling
Before Shell can drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean, it needs to prove to federal officials that it can clean up a massive oil spill there. That proof hinges on a barge being built in Bellingham called the Arctic Challenger.
The barge is only one component of Shell's plans for handling oil spills off the remote north coast of Alaska. But the Obama Administration won't let oil drilling get under way until the 36-year-old barge and its brand new oil-spill equipment are in place.
On board the Arctic Challenger is a massive steel "containment dome." It's a sort of giant underwater vacuum cleaner. If efforts to cap a blown-out well don't work, the dome can capture spewing oil and funnel it to a tanker on the surface.
The Arctic Challenger passed several US Coast Guard tests for seaworthiness in September. But it was a different story when its oil-spill containment system was put to the test in 150-foot-deep water near Anacortes, Washington.
The federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement required the test of the oil-spill system.
“Breached like a whale"
According to BSEE internal emails obtained by KUOW, the containment dome test was supposed to take about a day. That estimate proved to be wildly optimistic.
Day 1: The Arctic Challenger's massive steel dome comes unhooked from some of the winches used to maneuver it underwater. The crew has to recover it and repair it.
Day 2: A remote-controlled submarine gets tangled in some anchor lines. It takes divers about 24 hours to rescue the submarine.
Day 5: The test has its worst accident. On that dead-calm Friday night, Mark Fesmire, the head of BSEE's Alaska office, is on board the Challenger. He's watching the underwater video feed from the remote-control submarine when, a little after midnight, the video screen suddenly fills with bubbles. The 20-foot-tall containment dome then shoots to the surface. The massive white dome “breached like a whale,” Fesmire e-mails a colleague at BSEE headquarters.
Then the dome sinks more than 120 feet. A safety buoy, basically a giant balloon, catches it before it hits bottom. About 12 hours later, the crew of the Challenger manages to get the dome back to the surface. “As bad as I thought,” Fesmire writes his BSEE colleague. “Basically the top half is crushed like a beer can.”
Representatives of Shell Oil and of BSEE declined to answer questions or allow interviews about the mishaps. In an email, Shell spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh writes:
Our internal investigation determined the Arctic Challenger's dome was damaged when it descended too quickly due to a faulty electrical connection, which improperly opened a valve. While safety systems ensured it did not hit the bottom, buoyancy chambers were damaged from the sudden pressure change.
Environmental groups say the Arctic Challenger's multiple problems show that Shell isn't prepared for an Arctic oil spill.
Environmentalist Todd Guiton lives on Sehome Hill in Bellingham. His condo overlooks the Bellingham Shipping Terminal, where the Arctic Challenger has been under construction for a year now.
“Just look out our window, and there it is,” Guiton says.
He says the steel dome came back from its sea trial with its top half crumpled like a piece of paper. In the two months since, Guiton says, he's been watching Shell contractors rebuild the dome and reinforce it with more steel.
“This has to be a very beefy operation to do what they claim it'll do,” Guiton says.
It failed under very calm, tranquil conditions in the best time of year up here in the Pacific Northwest. If it can't handle the best we have here, I really have my doubts it can handle even a little adversity in the Arctic.
Spokeswoman op de Weegh wouldn't say what Shell is doing to fix the dome or when it would be ready for testing again.
Earlier in November, the Obama administration called for more research into handling oil spills in the far North.
The Arctic Research Commission said oil-spill experiments and tests need to be done in the Arctic Ocean and that federal regulators need more staff or more time to properly vet proposals for offshore drilling at the top of the world.

Help John Ryan follow up on this story.
Where do you find the kinds of cornerstone player around whom you can build a Stanley Cup contender? This is a matter of no small importance to Ken Holland and the Detroit Red Wings, who seem to have entered the phase that many teams enter in which they tread water on the edge of the playoffs before sinking beneath the waves, not to be seen for a decade.
A personal aside: the launch of The Athletic Detroit has had me digging more deeply into the Red Wings. The parallels between the Red Wings and the Edmonton Oilers circa 2007 (once upon a time, my favorite team) are amazing. Both organizations came off good times that suffered a rough season and didn't want to plunge into a rebuild. Both had prospects/young players who aren't guys you build a contender around.

Hussein Yusef, 21, arrived in Britain from Afghanistan at the age of 14, and attended the Oxford Spires Academy
A gifted student and keen cricketer from Oxford has been jailed for six and a half years after posting the personal details of more than 50 US military personnel onto Facebook after becoming a propagandist for ISIS.
Hussein Yusef, 21, arrived in Britain from Afghanistan at the age of 14, applied for asylum, and was brought up by foster parents in Oxford.
He had little English but made 'remarkable progress' at Oxford Spires Academy, gaining two A grades at GCSE, winning school prizes for business and product design, and volunteering to show parents around the school.
He captained the Under-16s school cricket team and also played for East Oxford and the Wayfarers cricket clubs.
His background mirrors that of Ahmed Hassan, the man charged with the failed Parson Green bombing, who was in foster care in Surrey.
'This case is about the defendant's journey from promising, respectful student to tireless supporter of one the most blinkered and brutal terrorist groups the world has ever known,' Barnaby Jameson, prosecuting, told Kingston Crown Court.
'In the period we are concerned about, the defendant became a prolific and apparently irrepressible propagandist for Islamic State.
'The defendant embraced with open arms Islamic State's uniquely twisted and fanatical view of the world [and] bought wholesale into Islamic State's particular obsession with intolerance, sadism and murder.'
After leaving school, Yusef was offered a place studying criminology at Southampton University but his application for permanent leave to remain in Britain was rejected and he moved to London while he appealed the decision.
Sharing a room with two other men in a house in Kilburn, north London, Yusef began working for TK Maxx until his appeal failed and his refugee status was revoked.
He stayed in the country illegally but began working for Chicken Cottage in Willesden and Rooster Grill in Ladbroke Grove where he was said to be a 'competent, hard-working employee.'
Four months later, on December 11 2015, he used a Facebook account to share a list of 56 names and addresses for US military personnel that had been hacked by a group calling itself the Cyber Caliphate Army.
It included email addresses, home addresses across the United States including New York, Washington, Texas and California, along with their bases including Virginia, North Carolina and Hawaii.
He used a Facebook account to share a list of 56 names and addresses for US military personnel that had been hacked by a group calling itself the Cyber Caliphate Army
Yusef added the hashtags 'US Army pigs completely hacked' and 'AnonyDogs' and wrote: 'All praise to Allah alone.'
The list had appeared just one minute earlier on another Facebook page called Khilafah News [Caliphate News], for which Yusef appeared to be the administrator.
It had almost 1,000 'likes' and described itself as an 'Islamic State bulletin.'
The page included a sub-section called the 'Hijrah Committee' which gave advice to individuals seeking to join ISIS.
Mr Jameson said it was 'unadulterated IS propaganda, plain and simple.'
The details of serving military personal were 'emblazoned across the internet for all to see', Mr Jameson said, adding it was information 'putting those whose personal details were leaked in a clear and present danger of terrorist reprisals.'
'The defendant's motives were clear, were they not?' he said.
From his bedroom he set up five Facebook accounts to fight what was described as an 'ISIS propaganda war', ranting against homosexuality, Shia Muslims, The United States and 'Kuffar'.
In December 2015 he wrote 'if a kafir does not see you as a threat to his safety then you know you have something wrong with the way you practise the Deen [religion].'
In March 2016 he changed his Facebook cover photo to a quote 'The Islamic State: a state for all Muslims, so let's participate together to build and protect it'.
One of the videos he posted was titled 'Ramadan Under the Shades of the Khalifah', showing IS fighters attacking the Syrian Army.
He also shared a photo of a killed ISIS commander called Essa Al-Laqtta Abu Aisha, writing below 'may Allah accept him, he achieved the ultimate s
Police found Google searches on his computer 'Kill Kuffar in the same way they have killed u quran' and 'retaliation against the kuffar quran', Kingston Crown Court heard
Police found Google searches on his computer 'Kill Kuffar in the same way they have killed u quran' and 'retaliation against the kuffar quran.'
After the Paris and Brussels attacks he called on other Muslims to study the Quran to 'learn why those attacks were 100% right'.
He also boasted on encrypted social media app, Telegram, that he had attended a protest outside the Israeli embassy with a homemade poster saying 'Hitler you were right.'
Yusef was jailed for six and a half years for making a record of terrorist information, and three years concurrently for encouraging terrorism and disseminating terrorist publications.
With long hair and wearing a smart grey suit and dark tie, he rubbed his eyes as the sentence was delivered.
Yussef slumped in his chair as Judge Paul Dodgson told him: 'You're now 21 years old, and you came to this country in 2010.
'Teachers at school said you were delightful to teach and eager to learn, charming and delightful.
'By September 2015 you asylum application had failed and all avenues of appeal were closed to you.
'By then that boy from school had been transformed into an enthusiastic supporter of ISIS.
'I believe it's likely that if you were not the spreadsheet's author you were closely linked to the person who was.
'The material contained the names and addresses of members of US armed forces.
'The effects of your actions were considerable.
'The danger posed by that post was considerable and you knew that your audience had a number of people who were in touch with those capable of carrying out attacks.
'You knew that you were putting out on the internet personal details that could place those individuals in a great deal of peril.
'It seems to me that this is one of the most serious examples of this offence.
'It may be that you didn't think through your actions, but that would have been of little relevance to the families of those servicemen who might have been murdered as a result of your actions.'
Jamie Macmillan will be doing everything in his power to return to the North line-up before the end of the season following a high-grade finger injury on Saturday night.
The defender caught his right ring finger in the shorts of a Gold Coast player during a tackle in the second quarter and is set to miss around six weeks according to North doctor Peter Baquie.
“Jamie will require surgery to repair the flexor tendon after it was pulled off the bone,” he told NMFC.com.au.
“A surgeon will reattach the tendon on Thursday and unfortunately, that means Jamie is looking at around six to eight weeks on the sidelines, but we're very optimistic about it being the former.”
The news isn't great for Jarrad Waite either, with the 34-year-old sustaining a calf injury.
“Depending on his recovery, Jarrad could be looking at about three to four weeks,” Baquie said.
Waite was North's most dominant player against the Suns with 19 disposals, 4 goals and 6 tackles.
Meanwhile Marley Williams will miss one to two weeks with a back strain.

EA has revealed that it plans to expand its subscription services - like Xbox One's EA Access and PC's Origin Access - to "other platforms", although it doesn't specify exactly what they'd be.
Speaking on an EA earnings call (as transcribed by Seeking Alpha), CEO Andrew Wilson discussed the success of the existing subscription services, before revealing its future plans:
"Our subscription services like EA Access and Origin Access are bringing more players from across our network to join in. Our subscription player base continues to grow. And you should expect us to continue driving this model to more platforms going forward."
Exit Theatre Mode
Wilson went on to explain the significance of the subscription model to EA, explaining that because of its "live service" games (such as FIFA, Madden and the upcoming Star Wars Battlefront 2), players will download games included in the package before paying more for them down the line:
"The one thing that's often lost when we have this conversation is that unlike linear media, the subscription fee paid is not the total value of what a player might expend as they enjoy the games they play inside of subscription [...]
"And so we believe long term, while it may take us some years to facilitate that at the kind of scale that we expect it to evolve to, in the same way that digital music and digital movies have evolved, the upside for the interactive entertainment industry is uncapped by virtue of the value of live services that are born inside of a subscription."
The rise of the kinds of microtransactions that Wilson is talking about have been the subject of recent controversy around the issue, not least as EA shut down Visceral Games and pivoted its single player game to a live service model.
Exit Theatre Mode
EA CFO Blake Jorgensen added that the existing services will likely be expanded, too:
"We've been doing a lot of work on Origin Access and EA Access. And as Andrew mentioned, you'll most likely see those on other platforms. And you'll most likely see additional content coming into those subscriptions and some exciting things to come there. But we believe that's a very important way for more consumers to enjoy more games over time at a very reasonable price."
The Access services currently offer a "vault" of free-to-download EA games, as well as discounts and early access for new titles, in return for a monthly payment.

A Nearly Perfect Ballplayer
"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today....He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."—Ty Cobb, Life Magazine, 1952
This is high praise from one of his fellow greats for Stan "The Man" Musial, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 92.
In addition to being one of the greatest baseball players to walk the Earth, Musial will forever be remembered for his genuine kindness off the field. As the king of St. Louis—the baseball capital of the world—Musial was one of the most consistently dominant hitters of any generation.
He ranks first in nearly every offensive category in the storied history of the St. Louis Cardinals franchise. He's in the top 10 in games played, at-bats, doubles, RBI, runs, hits and total bases in MLB history.
And while Musial may not have had the power of Babe Ruth or the batting average of Ty Cobb, a very strong case can—and should—be made for him as the greatest hitter in baseball history.
Statistically Elite
There is no doubt in any objective analyst's mind that Musial is one of the best hitters to ever live. But just how good, exactly?
The 1969 Hall of Fame inductee (93.2 percent of the vote in his first year of eligibility) had a career batting average of .331, hit 475 home runs, drove in 1,951 runs, walked more than twice as much as he struck out, registered an on-base percentage (OBP) of .417 and an on-base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS) of .976.
Musial was a three-time MVP, three-time World Series champion (including a fourth win as a manager) and won the National League batting title a whopping seven times. He finished in the top 10 of the MVP vote in 14 seasons, including 10 straight in the middle of his career.
Perhaps most impressively, Musial shares a record 24 All-Star Game appearances with Willie Mays, even though he only played 22 seasons of professional ball (MLB held two All-Star Games for a few seasons).
Eternally Underrated
Despite everything you just read, perhaps no American athlete has ever been more underrated than Musial. For example, when Major League Baseball released its All-Century Team in 1999, it had to scramble to add Musial to the roster when he was originally snubbed by the fan vote.
In 2003, fellow players voted Musial the eighth-greatest living player in a Sports Illustrated poll, 11 percent behind Alex Rodriguez. Talk about disrespect; Musial only garnered 1.7 percent of that vote.
There may be no single reason why Musial has been underrated for so many years. But I have theories. For one, the time frame in which he played was dominated by the media darlings in New York and Boston, players such as Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox and Mickey Mantle of the New York Yankees.
But Musial also kept a low profile. He gave the media no reason to remember him aside from his actions on the diamond.
While Musial will always be a hero to the people of St. Louis and diehard baseball fans everywhere, he is by no means a known quantity to the casual fan. It's a shame, but it contributes to his anonymity.
Digging Deeper
Let's take a longer look at the question I'm posing here. Does Musial have a case as the best hitter of all time? You saw the career statistics and his ranking among baseball's best. And nobody can deny the mind-boggling numbers Musial consistently put up over 22 seasons.
But when we dig deeper, the numbers get even more astonishing. Nine times, Musial finished with 40 or more doubles. Eight other times, he finished with 10 or more triples.
Impressed? That's nothing.
In his most strikeout-prone season (as a 41-year-old in 1962), Musial whiffed just 46 times. To put that in perspective, Barry Bonds averaged 83 strikeouts per year, Cobb's career high was 54. and even the career on-base percentage leader, Ted Williams, racked up 50 K's in an average year. Adam Dunn, on the other hand, may reach 600 career home runs, yet he struck out 222 times in 2012 alone.
That would have taken Musial nearly seven full seasons to accomplish. Simply put, Musial put the ball in play, and he hit it hard. And for my money, he did it more consistently than anybody else.
Check this out: Though it's nearly impossible to choose a "peak" of Musial's career, he did have an especially astounding run from 1943-1958 (not including 1945, the year he served in the military). In those 15 seasons, Musial never hit below .310, never hit fewer than 30 doubles and never had an OPS below .902.
Also, from the year Musial won his third and final MVP award in 1948 through 1954, we see some of the most remarkable numbers in baseball history. In those age 27 through 33 seasons, Musial's lowest OPS was .970, his lowest average was .330, and he hit 30 homers and had 100 RBI five times.
In normal peak years, as it's measured today, Musial had statistics that would top the league even now.
Sizing Up the Competition
Calling Musial the greatest hitter in baseball history is not something to take lightly. This means he is better than Ruth, Bonds, Cobb, Mantle, Mays, Williams, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron and many more legends who all have a horse in this race.
So how does Musial stack up in the most important offensive categories for determining greatness? Though home runs and runs scored are important factors, they can't be distributed evenly because there are so many different types of hitters.
For the purposes of this article, I will use batting average, OBP, OPS, total bases and wins above replacement (WAR) to measure the differences between Musial and the rest of the field. I believe this gives a fair balance of a player's ability to make contact, get on base, hit for power and generate runs.
Among the players listed above, this is how they stack up against Stan the Man (category leaders in bold):
PLAYER Average OBP
OPS Total Bases WAR Stan Musial .331 .417 .976 6134 123.4 Babe Ruth .342 .474 1.164 5793 159.2 Barry Bonds .298 .444 1.051 5976 158.1 Ty Cobb .366 .433 .945 5854 144.9 Mickey Mantle .298 .421 .977 4511 105.5 Willie Mays .302 .384 .941 6066 150.8 Ted Williams .344 .482 1.116 4884 119.8 Lou Gehrig .340 .447 1.080 5060 108.5 Hank Aaron .305 .374 928 6856 137.3
As you can see, Musial is right in the thick of it in all five categories. Among these all-time greats, he ranks fifth in batting average, second in total bases and sixth in WAR.
While all the above players had legendary careers, not all can say they were as incredibly consistent or well-rounded a hitter as Musial. I hate to get into what-ifs, but if Musial doesn't miss one season for military duty, his career averages dictate another 25 or more homers, which would put him in the 500-home run club to boot.
Ruth is the only one who had a streak of peak years that rival what Musial did in his late 20s and early 30s. Aaron is the only one on the list with more total bases (and only Cobb has more career hits).
As one of two non-traditional power hitters on this list, Musial still comes in just one percentage point behind Mantle in a stat that takes into account one's slugging percentage, and he's well ahead of Aaron and Mays.
Williams had higher averages and percentages, but he accounted for fewer bases and was worth four fewer wins over his career than Musial. Even Cobb, the all-time hits leader for three quarters of a century, managed to account for about 250 fewer bases than Musial.
And even when measured against Ruth, the greatest slugger of them all, Musial accounted for more bases than Ruth and was in the top 10 of his league in important categories more often than the Sultan of Swat.
But I digress. Musial has a legitimate case as the greatest hitter who ever lived because in an era that saw so many Hall of Famers come through, Musial was a constant presence. He was always one of the best, if not the best, players in the league—and the production never seemed to wane.
Even today, Musial would regularly top the leaderboards in most offensive categories. And although it's impossible to tell for sure, you can bet on Musial putting up those numbers every single year, just like he did while wearing the birds on the bat for 22 years.
A Legendary Legacy
Forget all the stats, records, awards and recognition. Forget that Bill James ranks Musial as the third-best player ever by "Gray Ink" (a measure that compares and fairly ranks players from different eras against each other, based on top-10 finishes in "important" stat categories).
Or that James scores Musial as his most obvious Hall of Fame choice, three-and-a-half times the 130 score that determines a "virtual cinch" (at 540, Musial ranks first).
What is important is that Musial was one of the greatest people and players that baseball will ever see. The MLB family has lost someone very special. Musial was more than just a ballplayer. He was a hero, philanthropist, role model and warrior.
And no matter your verdict on whether Musial is the best hitter of all time, his legacy will flourish. Even if he stays under the radar, Stan the Man will forever be the embodiment of baseball. The perfect player, if ever there were such a thing.
Former MLB commissioner Ford C. Frick said it best:
"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight." (Inscribed on a statue of Musial outside Busch Stadium.)
Never have truer words been uttered about such a magnificent player and human being—possibly the most magnificent player who ever lived.
Rest in peace, Stan the Man.

Home Why? The objective of this research was to develop a novel programming method that embraces logical framework technology at its core. To achieve this goal we designed and implemented a functional programming language called Delphin that allows users to program with proofs, theorems, algorithms, etc. as if they were numbers, lists, trees, or arrays. The representation is direct and elegant because common concepts such as environments, variables, and substitutions are implicitly provided and need not be explicitly handled by the programmer. Delphin has the following features: It utilizes the logical framework LF for representation, which supports higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) and dependent types.
It provides a computation level to manipulate LF data.
It contains meta-level totality checks allowing the programmer to write proofs as the totality of a function entails that the input yields the output.

The Methodist church that dismissed two gay day-care workers said Monday that it has reached an agreement with the women.
The pact was announced after Aloma United Methodist Church was threatened with a lawsuit and was rebuked by state leaders for dismissing the two women.
Aloma United Methodist is offering to give the women letters of recommendation, state that they left voluntarily, and meet with gay-rights groups to better understand issues regarding sexual orientation.
In addition, the state Florida Conference of the United Methodist Church will pay Jaclyn Pfeiffer, Kelly Bardier and their attorneys $28,476.
The action by Aloma UMC comes after state Methodist leaders criticized the church for the dismissals of Pfeiffer and Bardier, two lesbians employed in the church's day-care center.
A letter from Conference Superintendent the Rev. Annette Stiles Pendergrass said the dismissals of the women violated their civil rights under church policy.
"To the extent that Aloma UMC took action against Ms. Pfeiffer and Ms. Bardier based on their sexual orientation, such actions were improper…," the letter stated.
Bardier and Pfeiffer could not be reached for comment Monday.
The women worked for Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center, which is run by Aloma UMC. They say they were fired in March after they were asked by school Director Barbara Twachtman whether they were a lesbian couple.
Aloma Methodist Pastor Jim Govatos said the women were not fired but left voluntarily. Under church policy, unmarried employees can be terminated for cohabitating or having sexual relations.
The women's attorney said they were told they risked termination because of their relationship.
"They were given an ultimatum of stop being gay or you are fired," said Mary Meeks.
Govatos also said the issue was not whether they were gay, but whether they were sexually intimate while unmarried — a violation of church employment policy that applied to straight as well as gay individuals.
"The [day-care] director asked them if they were involved in a sexual relationship. Each one on their own admitted that they were," Govatos said.
Meeks said they were never asked about whether they were sexually intimate — only whether they were in a relationship.
"My clients were never asked and never discussed that they were in a sexual relationship. They were never asked that question," Meeks said.
Govatos said unmarried straight employees are held to the same standard and have been terminated in the past for continuing to have sex outside of marriage. According to a statement released by the church, "Sexual orientation is not a determining factor in employment at Aloma UMC; but sexual behavior by both gay and straight people can be."
Govatos said even if Bardier and Pfeiffer were legally married in Florida, they could still have faced termination because Aloma UMC has not updated its policy to deal with same-sex marriage. Govatos, who is leaving Aloma for a position in Tallahassee within two months, said he thought it best for his successor to make that decision.
"I did not think it would be fair to pre-empt my successor's conversation with local leadership about that," said Govatos, who has been with the church for five years.
Methodist Bishop Ken Carter is scheduled to meet with Bardier and Pfeiffer on Wednesday in Lakeland. According the settlement agreement, Carter will then send a letter to Methodist pastors in Florida reminding them of the church policy against violating a person's civil rights based on sexual orientation.
In its statement, Aloma UMC said civil rights are important, but so are employment policies based on a moral standard established by the Bible.
"We believe those in the gay community should have their civil rights protected and we will actively fight to defend those rights," the church stated. "However, it is our desire to maintain an employee conduct policy that serves as a sign for God's best intentions for Christian discipleship and specifically mandates that our employees refrain from any sexual relations (whether gay or straight) outside of marriage."

1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 L78 Reading time: about 2 minutes. American
Cars
Retro
Vintage
The Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 L78 was a 375 horsepower version of the 396 cubic inch V8, it was the second highest spec that you could order a Chevelle in in 1969 – with the highest being the L89 offering identical power but including aluminium heads.
The smart money was always on the L78, it cost $252.80 more than the stock Chevelle SS but the L89 cost $647.75 more – and it was essentially identical from a performance perspective. Along with the upgraded 375 hp engines the L78 also came with the F41 heavy-duty suspension – this included stiffer springs, a large stabilizer bar and stiffer shocks on the front backed with a 4-link coil spring rear layout, also with firm shocks. The rear lower control arms were boxed by a plate welded across the sides for reinforcement and a rear stabilizer bar was bolted to the inner sides of the control arms – the upper arms were braced to handle the significantly increased torque of the L78.
The styling of the Chevrolet Chevelle SS is classic late-60s American muscle car – the Coke bottle side profile was the best in the business and the model competed solidly with the likes of the Ford Mustang.
The Chevelle SS you see here was nut and bolt restored two years ago by the specialists at Thornton Autoworks in Telford, Pennsylvania. It maintains its original drivetrain and Turbo Hydra-Matic 3-speed automatic transmission and 4.11:1 Posi-traction rear end, along with its original tuxedo black with black interior and red stripes.
It's now one of the nicest surviving examples of the '69 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 L78 in the country and it's expected to fetch between $55,000 and $65,000 USD when it's auctioned at the Auctions America Hilton Head Island event on the 31st of October 2015.

Recently I've been playing with Android's WebView based vulnerabilities, focusing on how to exploit them using a MITM attack.
One of the most interesting ones is the addJavascriptInterface vulnerability ( CVE-2012-6636 ) which affects every device running a version older than Android 4.2.
NOTE
The original title of this post was Autopwn every Android device on your network using BetterCap and the “addJavascriptInterface” vulnerability and some people pointed out it's a misleading title since “every Android != every Android < 4.2“. I totally agree with them, it wasn't intentional, the point of this post itself was not to show some uber 0day technique, but just to show how easy it is to use bettercap in order to exploit such type of vulnerabilities.
There's an excellent post about this vulnerability, long story short, if there's an app which is using a WebView UI control and it's declaring a custom javascript interface for it like so:
you can inject some special javascript into that page and make that device execute any shell command you want.
In this post, I'd like to show how easy it is to automatically exploit every vulnerable device on your network using bettercap and for this purpose I've wrote the AndroidPwn transparent proxy module.
As you can see, you just need to activate it and specify a --command COMMAND command line argument and you're ready to go.
Leave it running and it will automatically perform a Man-In-The-Middle attack on your network and execute the command(s) you've chosen on every single Android device it will find on the network.
Joanna Cherry MP QC says UK surveillance powers have gone ‘further than any other Western democracy'
THE UK has gone “further than any other Western democracy” in its extension of surveillance powers, according to SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC.
The comments were made during a panel discussion held by Scottish PEN, an organisation which works to defend freedom of speech, after a screening of documentary film The Haystack, which explores the UK Investigatory Powers (IP) Bill.
The IP Bill was introduced by the UK Government in a bid to extend surveillance and data-gathering powers – a move the government says is necessary in order to fight terrorism in the modern day. The new surveillance powers will permit UK intelligence agencies to collect, store and access information about internet users, which is stored online, but critics of the Bill say it infringes on civil liberties and personal privacy.
Cherry, who sat on the IP Bill committee as it went through parliament, said: “At least the IP Bill is honest about the fact that it permits the collection of bulk data. However, we shouldn't be too congratulatory of the Bill as we have now gone further than any other Western democracy."
Cherry, a member of the SNP who has previously vocalised her concerns over the surveillence powers that the IP Bill contains, explained to the panel audience that while surveillance powers are necessary to protect the country from terrorist threats, security measures need to be justified.
“America has rolled back from bulk collection at the very time the very time that Britain is trying to roll out greater surveillance powers on a statutory basis” Joanna Cherry QC MP
“The SNP felt that the Bill should be in accordance with European Union law, that we shouldn't be going further than other Western democracies and that we were interested in having suspicion-based surveillance rather than suspicionless surveillance,” she said.
Suspicion-based surveillance is when intelligence services have an interest in a particular person or organisation that they wish to target using surveillance. In some cases, they will require the approval of an independent judicial system, as well as the approval of parliament, before being able to carry out suspicion-based surveillance. In contrast, suspicionless surveillance, one of the most controversial aspect of the Bill, refers to the collection of bulk data without any justifiable reason why the data is needed.
“We shouldn't be going further than other Western democracies” Joanna Cherry QC MP
The SNP unsuccessfully opposed the IP Bill, which was passed by the House of Commons in March 2016. Cherry expressed concerns over the EU's position on the Bill, claiming that “certain aspects of the Bill will not survive under the European Convention on Human Rights, if we manage to stay in the EU”.
She went on: “America has rolled back from bulk collection at the very time the very time that Britain is trying to roll out greater surveillance powers on a statutory basis.”
America's surveillance powers, which were previously controlled by the Patriot Act, were called into question in 2013 as a result of documents leaked by NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden. Since then, the US has replaced the Patriot Act with the Freedom Act, passed on 2 June 2015, which permanently bans US intelligence agency NSA from collecting telephone records of private US citizens in bulk. The UK IP Bill permits the collection of bulk data, as opposed by the SNP.
There's unrest in Dota 2's community this week, as several artists responsible for many of the free-to-play game's popular cosmetic items allege that Steam owner and Dota 2 developer Valve Software has systematically reduced their earnings and may be permanently damaging the long-term viability of Dota 2's business model.
Dota 2 is completely free to play — all characters and mechanics are available to every player. Valve makes its money through the sale of in-game cosmetic items — colloquially referred to “hats” or “skins” by the community. Among other things, these cosmetic items give heroes completely new appearances.
The majority of these alternate skins are created by independent creators or teams who submit their designs via Steam's Workshop feature, which lets community members sell game content for titles that support it. Creators who have cosmetic items accepted by Valve for sale within Dota 2, or for inclusion in in-game promotions, are not paid a flat rate. They receive royalties on the sale of each item.
Initially, these cosmetics were offered directly through Dota 2's in-game store. Over time, these independent releases have dwindled, forcing creators to rely on inclusion in specific, event-related initiatives. These often reward players with cosmetics for purchases of in-game tickets and treasures. The biggest Dota 2 events are, unsurprisingly, Valve's own Majors, high profile tournaments with $3 million prize pools that lead to The International Dota 2 Championships each summer. That event's crowdfunded prize pool in 2016 exceeded $20,000,000 — which was funded in large part due to sale of “blind-box” treasure chests full of largely community-created items.
Complicating the situation further are “Battle Passes.” Offered in advance of Majors, the International, and other third-party tournaments, Battle Passes allow players to earn cosmetic items through completing quests. Players may also purchase blind-box, Battle Pass-specific treasures. These contain a random item from the Pass's cosmetic collection — assuming the player has also purchased the appropriate Battle Pass — but other items can only be earned.
Originally, creators and teams who contributed an item to a Battle Pass received an even share of royalties from sales of the pass and all related treasures for each set or item included. For example, a creator with two accepted cosmetics would receive two shares, but a creator with only one accepted cosmetic would receive one share. Treasures and event-related collections followed this by changing the manner Valve determines and allocates royalties.
This has, according to multiple creators Polygon spoke with, caused increasing consternation and concern.
Things reached a boiling point this week with an anonymous posting on the Dota 2 sub-forum on Reddit, which purported to be the combined observations and criticism of several high profile Dota 2 cosmetics designers. As of publication, Valve has not responded to a request for comment, and Polygon has not been able to determine who contributed to this “open letter.” However, we have spoken with more than half a dozen Steam Workshop creators responsible for some of the game's most popular items to confirm the basic claims made in the Reddit post. These are as follows.
In 2015, in the lead up to the fifth International Dota 2 Championship, Valve reduced the royalty rate from cosmetic items for its International and Majors promotions to 12.5 percent of net revenue — split evenly across all cosmetics contributors involved in that event — down from 25 percent. This change was not negotiated, according to multiple sources. Instead, Valve informed creators their items had been accepted for inclusion in the event in question, and that they would need to accept the new reduced royalty rate or forfeit participation. Valve has asserted to creators that this is in part because of a “substantial” contribution to the Battle Passes for Majors and The International. After the 2016 International, artists learned they would no longer receive royalties from the sale of Battle Passes (which coincided with a reduced schedule of Majors, from three yearly tournaments in advance of the International to just two). This caused two issues, according to workshop creators who spoke with Polygon. First, quests and experience within Battle Passes yield the same chests that players can opt to spend money for instead. A player who reaches level 60 in the most recent Battle Pass will earn 17 treasures without spending any additional money beyond the initial Battle Pass cost, meaning that creators' work is often given to players without compensation. Second, some creators feel that their earnings are being unfairly diluted, with shares of revenue from Battle Pass-specific chests going to creators whose cosmetics are only available via in-game quests. Workshop submissions are curated by the Dota 2 community, but Valve must give the final go ahead before a cosmetic item can go on sale within the game. Valve's move to release cosmetics predominantly around Majors and The International limits the opportunities for artists to sell sets within Dota 2's marketplace. Creators are also frustrated by what they allege is poor communication by Valve regarding events and their expected themes. Events often have specific motifs — this year's International, for example, is themed “A Call to Arms,” with an oceanic, pirate-oriented concept. This conceit isn't a problem, but it means that any items already in progress that can't conform to it must be shelved until after the 2017 International in August, or scrapped entirely.
In speaking with many creators, all of whom wish to remain anonymous, there is a palpable sense of frustration. “The amount of content Valve creates yearly for Dota is beyond miserable for a company of their size, experience, and financial status,” said one creator. “It is incredibly clear that the workshop fuels Dota, and creates a consistent stream of income for it. There's no other studio that I'm aware of that is in this type of position.”
Other creators explained that the value proposition of creating sets has diminished precipitously. “Assuming the same artist to artist split on each item, you would need to have five or even six items in Winter 2017 Battle Pass to make the same amount of money as ONE item in the Winter 2016 pass,” said another creator. Several others reiterated the feeling: “Things are effectively six times worse compared to a year ago, as of right now,” said one.
No creator would go on record with specific financial figures, as this is expressly prohibited by the terms they agree to in order to participate. However, speaking in general terms, there were commonalities. “It appears that artists involved in the Fall 2016 Major made about half of what they did in the Fall 2015 one, assuming the same amount of content,” said one creator. “It's also looking like the Winter 2017 Major is making about 50 percent of what the Fall 2016 did, maybe even less.”
This giant drop is causing some of the scene's most prominent voices to consider leaving Dota 2 entirely. “Many of us simply cannot afford to continue making items, even if we are lucky enough to see some work accepted.” As the number of free-to-play titles with financial incentives for creatives appear — and as more and more AAA releases incorporate freemium models and cosmetic microtransactions — the competition for creators increases, and Dota 2 is becoming less and less attractive. According to several creators who spoke with Polygon, many former Dota 2 Workshop contributors have already abandoned the game, choosing instead to create items for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, another Valve title with a burgeoning cosmetics market.
Valve does create some Dota 2 cosmetic items — each International brings a set of “Immortals,” and once or twice a year a Dota 2 hero will receive an “Arcana,” an expensive collection that involves a completely overhauled character appearance, including new voicework, effects, and other bells and whistles. However, the overwhelming majority of cosmetics in Dota 2 are created by artists independently via the Workshop. If too many creators leave, this could lead to serious complications for Dota 2, a game whose business model is entirely oriented around cosmetics.
This isn't the first time Valve has encountered challenges with a cosmetics-driven business model. In 2011, the developer's popular Team Fortress 2 went from a retail-priced title to an entirely free-to-play business model that in retrospect acted as a prelude to Valve's strategy with Dota 2. One prominent Team Fortress 2 Workshop creator Polygon spoke with — and who also wished to remain anonymous — explained that many of the changes to Dota 2's cosmetic sales mirror events in TF2's community.
“TF2 has always been Valve's testbed for a lot of these changes, and a few years ago, it started to implement the same methods that are now affecting Dota,” the TF2 Workshop contributor said. “‘Limited' cosmetics were implemented and available through crates in TF2 for a certain amount of time. The items could only be found through unlocking these crates, and only while these crates were active.
“Before the implementation, more often than not, cosmetics were also made available on the in-game Mann Co. Store, where items could be bought at full-cost upfront,” the contributor explained. “With the Mann Co. Store, contributors would receive the standard allocation of royalties from their items, while the limited crates drastically lowered those allocations. The artificial scarcity ultimately led to a smaller profit for the contributors involved, and the aspect of having your work be limited to a small time frame was a demoralizing lack of incentive for workshop contributors.”
And in a comment mirroring some of the complaints expressed by the Dota 2 creative community, the TF2 cosmetic creator we spoke with explained the detrimental effect on community morale that's resulted. “When there's no communication or incentive, it's hard to justify keeping it up.”
"It's scraps compared to what used to be a thriving system,” they said.
“(TF2) used to be a thriving system”
A common refrain from the people Polygon spoke to for this story was one of passion for not only the games, but the communities that have grown around them. And there's a continual hope that things will improve. There have been some signs of change at Valve in recent weeks.
One example: cosmetics creators, as important parts of the Dota 2 community, have traditionally been invited to attend The International, often to hold panels and tutorial sessions on site for aspiring designers and creators to break into the Workshop themselves. In 2016, however, Polygon has been told that creators were not given a clear commitment from Valve until just weeks prior to the event, leaving several scrambling to make last minute arrangements for flights and accommodations. This year, creators received invites to the event at around the same time dates were announced for it, a dramatic improvement.
“This community works very hard, and it's good to see people stepping up to talk about change for the better,” our TF2 Workshop source said. “A lot of the voices being heard are very prominent members of the workshop community, all coming together to say that something needs to be done. Valve had been doing things reasonably fine to an extent for years, but now, it needs fixing. I don't know exactly how, but I hope something can be done.”
Correction (4/2/2017): A previous version of this story said creators were told by Valve Corp. that they would no longer be compensated for Battle Pass sales of their content. They were given no such notification.
CANONSBURG, Pa. — Donald Trump Jr. defended Pennsylvania's coal industry from former President Bill Clinton in a Wednesday appearance in southwestern Pennsylvania.
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, the son of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump praised energy production jobs, which have kept the state afloat since the country's late-2000s recession, as important to national security as well as economic growth.
Trump lit into Bill Clinton's recent comments mocking coal workers. The former president called them “coal people,” said they believe global warming is a “Chinese hoax,” and taunted their work as outdated and obsolete. Breitbart News' Charlie Spiering reported on Clinton's remarks at a Pennsylvania rally last week:
He argued that coal workers should realize that the industry was dying and that it was time to focus on solar panels and windmills. “Coal employment peaked in 1920, coal production peaked in 1950,” he said, adding, “Climate change is real and we're going to have to change our energy source.”
Trump defended the relevance of coal workers: “When we talk about ‘electric cars,' hey guys, they're coal-powered cars,” he said.
“If there's been a boom in Pennsylvania, it's because of natural gas. Your Democratic governor wants to take credit for that, but guess what? Hillary Clinton wants to shut those things down. She wants to be beholden to Saudi Arabia, who writes her $25 million checks.”
Trump continued this line of attack, arguing that preserving the U.S. energy industry is a “national security” issue.
“That's not just common sense, it's not just energy independence, it's not just jobs and tax base, it's national security,” he said. “To be able to take care of ourselves and make sure we're utilizing the resources that we've been blessed to have — I mean, we're the natural gas capital of the world. And yet, she'd want to shut that down so that we can write checks to countries that hate our guts and hate our values and hate everything about us. That's not gonna happen on our watch.”
Asked about his father's chances of winning Pennsylvania — which has not gone to a Republican presidential candidate since 1988 — Trump touted local efforts like the Southpointe office celebrating its grand opening on Wednesday. He said a strong get-out-the-vote effort would come from “people on the ground speaking to the union voters. Yes, the union bosses, they've been bought and paid for by the DNC for generations. But the actual workers, the working-class men and women of this country, those are the people who are going to break party lines.
“They're gonna come and vote for Trump, because, you know what? They want to see common sense infused back into politics, back into government. They're sick of seeing everyone around DC and all the zip codes around DC being the richest in the country while they suffer.”
When Marquess Wilson's "resignation" letter made the rounds about two hours before Saturday's game, it didn't take long for me to get absolutely sick to my stomach. Part of it was that I hated to see this whole situation end this way - I had been holding out hope that a mutual agreement still could be reached. But most of it had to do with the language that Wilson used.
Specifically, his use of the word abuse. Because saying that word is the proverbial bell that can't be un-rung, the toothpaste that can't be put back in the tube, and whether Mike Leach did anything that he's accused of is irrelevant today in the court of public opinion -- in this culture of snap judgments, people already are making up their minds.
Maybe Wilson knew exactly what he was doing, and this is what he wanted. Maybe he didn't anticipate the ramifications of what he -- or a representative of his -- was writing. I don't know Wilson at all, so I can't speak to his intentions. But at this point, the reality is that intentions don't really matter, because the damage is already being done. Comments similar to, "Maybe Adam James was telling the truth, after all!" and, "One accusation is an aberration, two is a trend" are popping up all over the place.
Even if Leach is exonerated, it's going to be a stain that can't be removed. We know this, because it's happened before.
In the wake of WSU hiring Leach, I was appalled at the number of people who still thought Leach actually locked Adam James in a closet. Why did they think that? I would assume it's because of the initial coverage in the wake of the allegation. In the newspaper business, it's a well-known fact that allegations appear at the top of A1, while the exonerations appear on C4. Mountains of evidence exists that James' accusations were patently false, yet the perception persists.
And perception becomes reality in a fraction of the time it used to.
I work in a profession where allegations of abuse are taken as seriously as they possibly can be. That's a good thing. Check that -- it's a great thing, and absolutely the right thing to do. If only one out of 100 -- or even 1,000, or whatever number you want to come up with -- allegations is proven to be true, it's all worth it to end the abuse to that one child. Because of what we know about the general reluctance of victims to come forward, it's imperative that we take every accusation seriously. There was a situation when I was a high school student that resulted in a teacher I was close to losing his job, and it was the right thing. The girl who was violated will always have to live with what happened, but justice was served as best it could be. I've also seen a colleague lose his job over a legitimate complaint.
However, to pretend what we've got is some sort of perfect system for ferreting out the abusers that doesn't come with collateral damage to the innocent is to be blind to the real world. I've watched as people I respect have been made to squirm, their careers hanging in the balance as allegations of impropriety are investigated. Even as they stand confident in the knowledge that they've done nothing wrong, they know that for the remainder of their career, even as the accuser fades into anonymity, there will always be this in their file: "Formally investigated for alleged abuse."
No matter who "wins" in these complaints, everyone loses.
And now, as President Elson Floyd does the wise thing and initiates a pair of investigations into Wilson's claims, Mike Leach will have been investigated not once, but twice for abusing his players. That's never going away, no matter the outcome. I won't pretend that the damage already done by the accusation somehow makes the outcome irrelevant; if cleared, he'll keep his multimillion-dollar job, and that obviously matters.
But there will always be that stain.
Perhaps Mike Leach is found to indeed be an abuser of college football players, at which time I'll gladly laud Wilson for his courage in standing up to a bully. And I'll lament the stain left on Wilson by Leach's actions, rather than the other way around.
But there's something about this that just doesn't feel right.
As I mentioned, I've seen both sides of this sort of thing, and in most cases signs tend to point one direction or the other from the outset. I want to take seriously Wilson's claims. I really do. But I'm left with so many nagging questions.
If justice, rather than public relations spin is the goal, why send it to the media on a Saturday three hours before a football game on national TV, rather than filing a formal complaint with the school on Friday or Tuesday?
Why fail to provide specific examples of abuse from the outset? When asked by Bud Withers, Wilson's stepdad, Richard Miranda, would not provide any examples of Wilson being abused, and could only come up with a "hearsay" example of what happened at halftime of the Utah game, suggesting - perhaps - that Wilson himself may not have even seen it.
Why, if Wilson had already quit the team because he was abused, would his stepdad have to push him to come forward with the allegations, as Miranda said? I understand victims often are reluctant, but at the point at which Wilson quit, there's really no reason for him not to come forward if it's true and as serious as the letter portrays. Leach has no more leverage in the situation.
I understand the third question is probably the weakest of all three - I'm aware that victims have all sorts of reasons only they know for being reluctant to come forward. But when combined with the other two irregularities, it adds up to something that makes me uncomfortable and makes it impossible for me to fully embrace the possibility that Wilson is telling the truth.
The problem with that? Not everyone will remember how this ultimately turns out, like I will.
The new season will feature the franchise's first “tournament of champions” event. Each episode will showcase 24 contestants competing in the world's largest extreme obstacle course, but for the first time, winners will be brought together at the end of the season to compete for the title of Ultimate Wipeout Champion.
When ABC announced, in August of '12, it was bringing back the competition series for a sixth season, including its 100th episode, Jill Wagner returned as co-host (Vanessa Minnillo replaced her in Season 5), and new obstacles and completely redesigned Wipeout Zones were added. A seventh season will continue to feature special themed episodes, including a chance to win a date with Wagner, as well as the return of popular themes such as “Boss & Employee.” “We are always looking for ways to keep the show fresh and exciting. This year, we are amping up the competition with a season long tournament of champions,” said Matt Kunitz, creator and executive producer.
While not as strong in the ratings as it was early in its run, Wipeout is still one of the few broadcast shows that pops a number during the summer and its family co-viewing numbers are good. Last summer, airing Thursdays at 8 PM, Wipeout was the No. 1 summer show for family co-viewing (adults 18-49 watching with teens and/or kids) on the major broadcast nets — 22% of its adult 18-49 audience watched with teens or kids. During its summer run, Wipeout beat its broadcast rivals in the Thursday hour to rank No. 1 with Kids 2-11.
Wipeout executive producers are creator Kunitz and Scott Larsen. Endemol USA produces. Wipeout is hosted by John Anderson (ESPN's SportsCenter), John Henson (E! Entertainment's Talk Soup).
Theories around the death of Grigori Rasputin still abound 100 years after the event. We examine the scientific credibility of some of the claims
The end of December marked the 100th anniversary of the death of Rasputin, the “mad monk of Russia”, or “lover of the Russian queen” if you believe the Boney M song, though you probably shouldn't. While the song is undoubtedly a floor-filler, unsurprisingly it is not exactly a reliable historical account of Rasputin's life.
Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin, a mystic and spiritual healer born in Pokrovskoe in Siberia, wielded huge influence over the Russian royal family, particularly Alexandra, the Tsarina, who looked to the spiritual healer to cure her haemophiliac son, Alexei. The life of Rasputin was certainly pretty strange but it is the stories surrounding his death that are the strangest of all.
The death of Rasputin - December, 1916 Read more
What is known is that one evening Rasputin went to the Yusupov Palace in St Petersburg at the invitation of Prince Felix Yusupov. Rasputin's dead body was recovered from the frozen Neva River days later. No one is completely sure what happened in between these two events.
The most well-known account of the events comes from Prince Yusupov himself in his memoirs Lost Splendour. This autobiography reads more like a boy's own adventure story than a reliable historical document and many doubt the authenticity of what he wrote. According to Yusupov, when Rasputin arrived at the palace he was taken down to the cellar where he was given cake and madeira wine. Upstairs, a gramophone played Yankee Doodle Dandy to fool the monk in to believing there was a party in full swing.
Yusupov and his accomplices had planned things carefully. The cakes offered to Rasputin had been laced with enough potassium cyanide to slay a monastery full of monks. But Rasputin just kept eating them. Incredulous at the monk's survival, Prince Yusupov poured madeira into a cyanide-laced wine glass and handed it to Rasputin. Instead of collapsing into unconsciousness within seconds, as would be expected from a massive dose of cyanide, Rasputin continued to sip the wine like a connoisseur. A second lethal glass disappeared into the monk's mouth with little apparent effect other than some difficulty swallowing. Asked if he was feeling unwell he replied “Yes, my head is heavy and I've a burning sensation in my stomach.” A third glass of tainted wine only seemed to revive him. Having ingested their whole stock of cyanide, the group of assassins is somewhat at a loss as to what to do next.
So they shot him.
The bullet appeared to have entered the body near the heart – certain death, or so they thought. But, soon after, Rasputin's eyes opened and, clearly upset at the turn of events, he attacked Yusupov. There was a ferocious struggle before the prince could free himself and run away up the stairs. Rasputin followed.
The group finally emerged into a courtyard, where four more shots were fired into Rasputin's body before he slumped to the ground. To make sure they wouldn't be troubled again, the assassins wrapped and tied the body with a piece of heavy linen, bundled it into a car and drove to Petrovski Island, where it was dropped from a bridge into the frozen river below.
The whole account sounds fanciful from start to finish, but remarkable things do happen. Human beings have achieved incredible physical feats in spite of horrible injuries. During a duel in the sixteenth century one man received a stab wound directly to the heart but still managed to run 230 yards to chase down his opponent before collapsing. Maybe Rasputin really was still alive after the first shot and capable of a fight. But what about the poison? Surely no one could eat so much cyanide with so little effect?
The theories as to why the cyanide didn't kill Rasputin are almost as numerous as the theories of how he really died. What is surprising is that the theories are scientifically credible.
The first theory is that the poisoners were simply rubbish at their job. Either they didn't use enough, or the cyanide they had was old stock that had decayed into something far less toxic. Though plausible, a century after the events it is impossible to tell if this is true.
The second theory is that Rasputin, aware that someone might be trying to kill him (he had survived at least one assassination attempt already), had decided to protect himself against poison. Perhaps he was inspired by Mithridates, king of Pontus in the first century BC, who, fearful of poisoners, concocted an antidote or preventative. By ingesting sub-lethal amounts of every known poison he developed an immunity. When Mithridates was under threat from the local populace he tried to kill himself with poison, but the attempt failed and he had to request that a guard kill him with a sword.

It is true that the body can develop a natural immunity or tolerance to some very toxic substances by administering very small doses over a period of time (this is definitely not a recommendation for DIY poison prevention). Some of these toxic compounds include snake venom, ricin and opiates, to name but a few. Unfortunately, cyanide isn't one of those substances. You simply cannot build up a natural tolerance to cyanide by using this method.
The third theory is that Rasputin had alcoholic gastritis, which can lead to having less stomach acid. Without acid in the stomach, the potassium cyanide can't be converted into hydrogen cyanide, and is therefore considerably less toxic. It's another plausible explanation, but no one really knows if Rasputin suffered from this complaint or not.
The fourth theory is that his poisoners unintentionally gave him the antidote along with the poison. Studies have shown that rats fed sugar with cyanide fare a lot better than those fed cyanide without it. The theory, though not proven, is that the sugar binds to the cyanide in a way that allows its excretion before it can be fully absorbed into the body. The assassins therefore may have chosen poorly when they elected to deliver the cyanide in sugary cakes and wine.
The final theory is that Yusupov made the whole thing up, and Rasputin was simply shot shortly after he arrived at the palace by a person or persons unknown. This is probably much nearer the truth – but it isn't nearly as interesting as stories of an “unkillable” monk.
Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, has said intelligence failure allowed the Taliban to carry out the latest attacks in Kabul and elsewhere in the country.
"The terrorists' infiltration in Kabul and other provinces is an intelligence failure for us and especially for NATO and should be seriously investigated," Karzai said in a statement on Monday.
The president however, praised the "bravery and sacrifice of the security forces who quickly and timely reacted to contain the terrorists".
In his first reaction after the series of attacks targeting Western embassies and NATO bases, which continued till Monday morning, Karzai said that "Afghan security forces proved to the people that they can defend their country successfully".
Gun battles between Afghan security forces and Taliban fighters in the capital, Kabul, ended after almost 18 hours of fierce fighting, according to government and police officials.
"The latest information we have about the Afghan parliament area is that the attack is over now and the only insurgent who was resisting has been killed," Hashmatullah Stanikzai, the Kabul police chief's spokesman, said on Monday.
There were conflicting reports regarding the number of casualties in the co-ordinated attacks that targeted mainly western installations in Kabul, which the Taliban described as the launch of a "spring offensive".
Afghanistan's defence ministry said 32 gunmen and three Afghan soldiers were killed in the operation against the multiple assaults, Reuters news agency reported.
But Bismillah Mohammadi, the Afghan interior minister, said 36 fighters, eight members of security forces and three civilians were killed and 44 others wounded in the gun battle, the AFP news agency reported.
Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, said: "They [Taliban] have been able to strike right in the heart of the city, supposedly the most well protected part of Afghanistan."
"There are now of course, serious questions about intelligence failings that allowed the Taliban to effectively lay siege of the city for almost 18 hours," he said.
'Peace efforts'
The Afghan capital awoke on Monday to a second day of explosions and heavy gunfire as a joint operation by Afghan and international forces worked to defeat the fighters holed up in one building in the heart of the city and another near the Afghan parliament.
Afghan-led forces fired one rocket-propelled grenade after another into a building in the centre of the city, where gunmen began the co-ordinated attacks on Sunday in the capital and three eastern cities.
Janan Mosazai, Afghan foreign ministry spokesman, said: "It is nearly impossible to stop all attacks by terrorists who continue to have sanctuaries and receive ideological, financial and logistical support outside Afghanistan."
"We will continue to fight the terrorists who pose a threat and danger to Afghanistan's security and stability and its young democracy," he said.
"At the same time we will continue to pursue peace efforts with armed opposition groups, including the Taliban and other groups.
"And for that we are engaging not only leaders within the Taliban and other opposition groups, but also countries in the region, particularly the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."
'Spring offensive'
The attacks on Sunday, which targeted embassies, government buildings and NATO bases, underscored the security challenge facing Afghan security forces as their US and NATO allies plan to leave by the end of 2014.
These were the the worst attacks in the capital since the Taliban was overthrown 11 years ago.
General Martin Dempsey, US military's top officer, told reporters there had been intelligence reports that indicated a potential threat from Haqqani militants, who exploit sanctuaries in neighboring Pakistan.
But the reports of a possible attack were "vague about timing," Dempsey said.
The Pentagon has blamed the Haqqani network for the attack but Dempsey said it was unclear if the attack could be traced back to Haqqani havens in Pakistan.
"The threat, you know, the Haqqani network exists on both sides of the border, so so we're not prepared to suggest this emanated out of Pakistan," he said.
A Taliban spokesman said the violence marked the start of their annual spring offensive which heralded the fighting season, adding that "a lot of suicide bombers" were involved.
It said the main targets were the German and British embassies, and the headquarters of Afghanistan's NATO-led force, all in Kabul.
Bombers struck across Afghanistan in co-ordinated attacks, with explosions and gunfire shaking the diplomatic area of Kabul as Taliban fighters took over nearby buildings and tried to enter parliament.
The assault appeared to repeat the tactics of an attack in Kabul last September when fighters entered construction sites in several places to use them as positions for rocket and gun attacks.
Some legislators grabbed weapons and started fighting when gunmen fired on the parliament building.
On Monday morning, Al Jazeera's Smith reported from Kabul that police had been seen removing bodies from the site of an assault on Taliban attackers who had been holed up in a construction site next to the Kabul Star hotel.
Afghan security forces, who are responsible for the safety of the capital, were scrambling to reinforce areas around the so-called "Green Zone" diplomatic section of the city centre.

The planning fallacy: a flaw in thinking we could do without
We like to think we're in control of our behaviour, our communication, and—perhaps most of all—our thoughts. And while that's generally true, there are some things that happen subconsciously, which we can't completely control.
Cognitive biases are essentially flaws in our thinking. Our brains have evolved to treat information in particular ways, or to lean in a certain direction when making decisions. These biases serve a purpose, but in modern life they can also trip us up. And because they're subconscious, we often don't even realize how our thinking has been affected.
While there are hundreds of cognitive biases that scientists have uncovered, the planning fallacy is one that affects most of us at some point. This particular bias can affect our productivity, how we work with others, and how we make decisions at work.
With a better understanding of how the planning fallacy affects our thinking, we can be aware of situations when we might be affected subconsciously, and try to avoid making decisions on autopilot that might not be our best.
The planning fallacy
In 1988, construction finally started on a project that was suggested as early as 1802: the Channel Tunnel between England and France.
The project's builders expected to see the first trains running through the tunnel by June 1993, but it was November of 1994—more than a year later—before the public were able to use the new construction. By the time the tunnel was officially opened, it was 80% over budget.
A similar story took place in Montreal in 1969. The mayor at the time, Jean Drapeau, announced that the city would build a state-of-the-art stadium for the 1976 Olympics, including "the first retractable roof ever built on a stadium." The entire Olympic building project was estimated to cost $120 million dollars.
Get Everyone on the Same Page. With Planio.
In 1989, 13 years late, the stadium roof was finally completed. It cost $120 million alone.
How could professionals make such a huge mistake in planning and estimating major projects like this? Well, they're only human, and like many of us do every day, they fell prey to the planning fallacy.
This bias in our thinking makes us underestimate how long projects will take, and overestimate how quickly we can get things done. Combined, those two mistakes in estimating leave us with unrealistic plans for anything from completing a small task to a multi-million dollar construction project.
I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by. — Douglas Adams
The planning fallacy causes us to create plans that are unrealistic, and underestimate the costs and time needed to compete projects. This leaves us relaxing too much in the early stages of a project, as we think we have plenty of time to get it done, and later scrambling to hit deadlines that weren't realistic in the first place.
This fallacy can also cause tension among employees and their leaders, as unrealistic expectations from above cause stress among the team.
How to overcome the planning fallacy
To avoid falling into the trap of the planning fallacy, try to pad out your estimates and plans more than you think you need to, and adjust the way you think about deadlines.
Plan for hiccups
One of the reasons the planning fallacy trips us up so easily is that we always plan for the best-case scenario. When researchers asked people to estimate how long something would take if it progressed typically, and then how long it would take if nothing went wrong, the two estimates were almost exactly the same.
Free your time from busy work and get organized. Use Planio
This shows that we tend to think of a typical scenario as being almost the same as a perfect scenario. But hiccups happen, and they throw us off course. To overcome this subconscious bias, try making a rule to consciously over-pad your estimates and plans.
Look to others for examples
Another reason we're too optimistic when planning is that we think our personal sample size of one is enough information to make an informed decision. But often, especially when dealing with a task or project that's unfamiliar to us personally, it can be helpful to gather information from others who've done this type of work before.
Psychologist and author Daniel Kahneman has been in this situation. He was once hired to lead a committee working on a new curriculum for Israeli high schools. After a year, Kahneman asked his colleagues how long they thought the project would take to finish, with one year of work under their belts. Most said somewhere around two years. But when Kahneman asked a colleague how long these type of projects had taken for other committees in the past, he found out that they usually took a minimum of seven years, and in fact, around 40% were never even finished.
Without looking at other examples, Kahneman may have expected the project to take three years in total, as most of his colleagues suggested. It actually took eight years, so five of those would have been very frustrating if the committee all thought they should have already been finished.
When you're facing a task or project you haven't worked on before, swallow your pride and ask around. Gather some statistics on how long these projects take for other people in a similar situation, to give yourself the best chance of a realistic estimate.
Never Miss Another Deadline. Try Planio.
Broaden your perspective
As Kahneman's example shows, focusing on the specifics of our current task or project can get in the way of realistic estimating. And while looking to others for examples can help, there's another way to broaden your thinking and improve your planning success.
Thinking in more vague terms about a project has been shown to make us estimate when they'll be finished more accurately. When asked to imagine the specifics of where and when they would do their Christmas shopping, participants in a study estimated they'd be finished with their shopping more than a week before Christmas. When asked simply when they would get their shopping done, without imagining the details, shoppers estimated around four days before Christmas. Both sets of shoppers actually finished their shopping three days before Christmas on average, so the more vague estimators were more accurate.
Without taking the specific details into account, we're forced to rely on an intuitive guess about how long something will take. It's likely that in relying on our intuition we subconsciously take into account our memories of similar tasks we've done in the past. Though it's hard to accept, you're more likely to determine an accurate estimate this way, so try not to think about any of the specifics when planning a new project.
Reframe your deadlines
Another reason we fall prey to the planning fallacy is that deadlines seem abstract when they're far away. A deadline of tomorrow or next Thursday feels immediate and concrete. But a deadline that's nine weeks or six months away is more abstract. It's hard to plan how your work should change today when you're thinking about a huge project that needs to be finished months from now.
Say goodbye to overtime and nights at the office. Get your projects organized
One trick that can help with this is reframing your deadline into a different format. Since days are an immediate, concrete time period we deal with often, reframing your deadline in terms of days can change the way you think about it.
A study tested this approach by asking participants how soon they would start saving for various events that were due to start in the future. For instance, for college that started in either 18 years or in 6,570 days, or for retirement that would start in 30 years or in 10,950 days.
The study found participants planned to start saving four times sooner when the deadline was expressed in days, rather than years. Numbering the days made the deadline seem closer and more concrete.
Simplify your task or project
There's one part of the planning fallacy that makes immediate sense when you hear it, but is often overlooked. It's this: compound probabilities make estimates harder.
To put that in different words, it means the more steps your task or project involves, the more opportunities there are for something to go wrong.
At each step, there's the possibility that you'll run into something unexpected, or the work won't go well. The more steps involved, the higher the chances that you'll run into trouble.
Unfortunately, we're not very good at taking this into account. We might think carefully about all the steps in a project when making a plan to get it done, but we don't think about what could go wrong at every step.
Finish Projects on Time and Budget. With Planio.
Since we're not very good at this, we can help ourselves out by removing as many steps as possible. Knowing we don't do well at estimating the potential hiccups at each step, we can reduce the likelihood of a hiccup occurring at all by taking out any unnecessary steps.
Unfortunately, we can't completely stop our subconscious minds from leaning on cognitive biases like the planning fallacy. These so-called flaws in our thinking actually help us when making quick decisions, but they tend to affect our thoughts without us realizing.
The good news is that being aware of how cognitive biases affect us can help us be on the lookout for them, and change our behavior to compensate.
Next time you struggle to hit a deadline, or notice a task taking much longer than you'd expected, check if the planning fallacy caught you out. If it did, build these approaches into your planning method for next time, and you may just be able to thwart your own brain.
Scientists have developed a new method for testing blood via sound waves, which could lead to a compact, portable testing kit that's simpler and more straightforward than the equipment in use today.
The test targets exosomes - tiny packets released by cells to carry messages around the body, including information about disease. Intercept those packets, and you can learn a lot about the body's health.
Existing test methods like ultracentrifuges or chemical tags also risk damaging the blood samples along the way, something which won't happen with the new technique, according to the international team of researchers who developed it.
"Acoustic sound waves are much gentler," says one of the team, Ming Dao from MIT. "These particles are experiencing the forces for only a second or less as they're being separated, which is a big advantage."

The new process is based on work done by the same team in 2014. Blood is passed through a very small channel and exposed to two tilted acoustic transducers, and as the sound waves from these transducers meet, they form pressure points.
These points can be used to divert cells into different channels depending on their size, and here the researchers used two of the devices: one to sort out the cells and platelets from the blood, and one to isolate the exosomes with higher frequency sounds.
"These exosomes often contain specific molecules that are a signature of certain abnormalities," says Dao. "If you isolate them from blood, you can do biological analysis and see what they reveal."
Exosomes have previously been flagged up as markers for cancer, kidney problems, and neurodegenerative disease, among other health issues – so getting a device that can be taken anywhere and can pick out exosomes from blood quickly would be a big win.
It's less invasive than a biopsy, it's accurate, and to begin with the researchers are going to see if they can use the technology to spot abnormal pregnancies earlier.
"The new technique can address the drawbacks of the current technologies for exosome isolation, such as long turnaround time, inconsistency, low yield, contamination, and uncertain exosome integrity," says one of the researchers, Tony Jun Huang from Duke University.
"We want to make extracting high-quality exosomes as simple as pushing a button and getting the desired samples within 10 minutes."
That is still some way off but considering the process of high-speed centrifugation can take 24 hours to complete, the hope is that results can be obtained much faster.
Using the new device, scientists were able to process a 100-microlitre, undiluted blood sample in less than 25 minutes.
What's more, it could help doctors analyse the condition of hard-to-reach organs – such as the placenta during pregnancy – by extracting and quickly testing blood samples.
"The capability of this method to separate these nanoscale vesicles, essentially without altering their biological or physical characteristics, offers appealing possibilities for developing new ways of assessing human health as well as the onset and progression of diseases," says one of the team, Subra Suresh from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
The research has been published in PNAS.
Boiled peanut fans, listen up.
"Food engineer" Albion Williams Jr.'s Tasty Nutz Peanuts were initially created in 2011 and sold the traditional way — at a roadside peanut stand. Following the enthusiastic reception of his product, Williams decided it was time to expand his endeavors.
In 2012, Williams created a vacuum-sealed, flavorful product that is cooked, packed and shipped fresh the day of ordering.
He's been shipping to Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Jamaica and beyond.
And on Tuesday, he held the grand opening for an all-peanut Tasty Nutz store at 14930 N Florida Ave. in Tampa. An opening party starts at noon Saturday with raffles and buy-one-get-one free cups of boiled peanuts through the weekend.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A lawyer for Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger said the pair were "shaken"
The CCTV footage seems routine. Four swimmers, fresh from celebrating their final competitions, return to the Olympic village in the early hours of the morning. They pass through the metal detector, taking items from their pockets - possibly wallets and phones - as they go. They appear relaxed.
But this short, unremarkable clip is now at the centre of an Olympic mystery and a police investigation because, according to the four US Olympic gold medal winners - Ryan Lochte, Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger, and Gunnar Bentz - they had just been robbed at gunpoint at a petrol station.
It seemed like a simple story at first, but the athletes' account has now been contradicted by Rio police who say they have evidence that the men were involved in a fight at the petrol station after one of them vandalised a toilet door, and that they invented the robbery to cover it up.
Mr Lochte has been back in the US since Tuesday. Mr Conger and Mr Bentz were allowed to fly home on Thursday - a day after they were pulled off a plane to be questioned. Mr Feigen is now also returning home after agreeing to donate nearly $11,000 (£8,300) to a Brazilian charity.
And on Friday Mr Lochte apologised for his actions, and "for not being more careful and candid".
Since the story began on Sunday morning, 14 August, it has taken more than a few twists and turns.
The story emerges
On Sunday afternoon, six or so hours after the swimmers returned to the village, USA Today and Fox Sports Australia, citing Mr Lochte's mother, reported that four US athletes had been robbed on their way back from partying at Club France, part of the French hospitality area.
According to the reports, the swimmers got in a taxi for the Olympic village at about 04:00. Speaking to NBC News hours after the story hit the headlines, Mr Lochte gave a vivid account of what happened next:
"We got pulled over, in the taxi, and these guys came out with a badge, a police badge, no lights, no nothing, just a police badge and they pulled us over. They pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground. They got down on the ground. I refused, I was like, 'We didn't do anything wrong, so I'm not getting down on the ground.'
"And then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said: 'Get down,' and I put my hands up, I was like 'Whatever.' He took our money, he took my wallet. He left my cell phone, he left my credentials."
Image copyright Other Image caption Ryan Lochte posted Snapchat videos during the night showing the group partying
Mark Adams, a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee, told the press that the swimmers' account was "absolutely not true".
Then Mr Adams retracted his statement, saying he received incorrect information from the US Olympic Committee (USOC). The USOC put out a statement confirming that the swimmers were robbed.
The swimmers did not report the incident to police or to the USOC, and officers in Rio only got involved after seeing it reported on TV.
Police struggle to find evidence
By this point, two of the four had made public statements about the robbery.
Posting on Instagram, Mr Lochte wrote: "While it is true that my teammates and I were the victims of a robbery early Sunday morning, what is most important is that we are safe and unharmed."
Mr Bentz tweeted: "We are all safe. Thank you for your love and support. P.S. the gold medal is safe."
At this point, a police official told the Associated Press that Mr Lochte and Mr Feigen were unable to give basic details and are contradicting each other's stories.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jack Conger (L) and Gunnar Bentz were pulled off their flight and interviewed at Rio airport
Mr Lochte and Mr Feigen had told police they left Club France at about 04:00 and took a taxi from a nearby petrol station. According to their account, they went straight from the club to the village - a journey of 30 to 40 minutes - with the robbery happening along the way.
But the CCTV footage clocked the swimmers returning to the village at 06:56, nearly three hours after they left the club.
Mr Lochte then slightly altered his account, telling NBC on Wednesday that the taxi was not pulled over but they were robbed while making a stop at a petrol station. And he said the gun was not pointed directly at his forehead.
Police tried and failed to find the taxi driver, or any other witnesses.
A Brazilian judge was sufficiently concerned that she ordered Mr Lochte and Mr Feigen to surrender their passports. But when police turned up at the Olympic village on Wednesday the four men had already moved out, and Mr Lochte had already landed in the US.
Mr Conger and Mr Bentz were then tracked down to a flight about to leave Rio. They were pulled off the plane for questioning. It later emerged that Mr Feigen was still in Brazil.
Robbery claim denied
On Thursday, police sources in Rio told the BBC that the swimmers invented the story about the robbery. They said that the four athletes arrived by taxi at a petrol station in Barra da Tijuca, 16km from the Olympic Park, where one of the athletes broke down a toilet door.
The petrol station attendants asked the Americans to pay for the damage, according to the police, and a verbal dispute ensued.
The athletes then reportedly paid the staff and left before police arrived. Police said they have identified the recording of the phone call from the gas station and the security guard at the station had given a statement to police.
Rio's civil police head Fernando Veloso later on Thursday emphatically denied a robbery took place. "They were not victims of the crimes they claimed," he said. He did concede that one of the security guards pointed his gun at the swimmers.
The people of Rio were unhappy to see the reputation of their city damaged, Mr Veloso said, adding that the city was owed an apology.
The USOC has apologised for what it called the unacceptable behaviour of the swimmers.
Story inconsistencies
VELLORE: A 56-year-old man was bitten and mauled to death by his pet dogs in Kattupakkam village in Vellore district of Tamil Nadu on Tuesday night.Kirubakaran, who was working as an assistant in the office of the additional director general of police, Government Railway Police , Chennai, went to his mango grove outside the village at about 10pm on Tuesday to feed the dogs, said a family member of the deceased.Around 10.20pm, the people in the nearby farms heard Kriubakaran's screams. When they rushed to the farm, they found him in a pool of blood with multiple dog bite marks.“He was rearing a Rottweiler female dog. Three days ago, he brought a male Rottweiler for breeding purpose. It attacked him when he went to feed them,” said the family member.Kirubakaran was immediately rushed to Government Hospital at Arakkonam but succumbed to his injuries. The Banavaram police registered a case.“There were multiple bites, particularly on the upper body,” said sub-inspector of police Munusamy. Police said both dogs might have attacked him.Rottweiler is a ferocious animal. It has powerful jaws and sharp teeth, said Dr T Manoharan, specialist –cum -deputy director (incharge) of Department of the Animal Husbandry, Vellore.“They will go wild when someone stops or disturbs them when they eat food. They get irritated and start attacking. They should be trained properly to obey the commands of the owner. Otherwise, they will pose a serious threat,” he said.Livestock sellers in Rottweil village in Germany created the particular breed to suit their demand, he said. “The butchers and livestock sellers will keep the money, which they made after selling the livestock in markets, in a leather belt tied around the dog's neck. They did this to prevent thieves from robbing them.”
Have you checked out the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to raise $20,000 for the Arizona Trail Association yet? We've got all sorts of fantastic incentives from Arizona Trail pint glasses to signed art prints and one-of-a-kind experiences. Launched on March 28th with a big belly dance kickoff event at Sky Bar Tucson, over $2,000 has been raised in the first week of the campaign!
The next day after a fantastic evening of dance and music, the next stop for the Arizona Trail Trek was Arizona Trail Day at Colossal Cave east of Tucson. I led a large group of folks on a hike from Gabe Zimmerman Trailhead to Posta Quemada Ranch at Colossal Cave Mountain Park. There was also a guided bike ride and a horseback ride as well. We all came together at the ranch for lunch and afternoon activities, including a visit from the birds at Wildlife Rehabilitation Northwest Tucson.
In the evening, the fun moved to the La Sevilla Campground, where we ate delicious food courtesy of It's Greek to Me and listened to the music of Eb's Camp Cookin' around the campfire. Terry, who is riding the whole trail with two horses and two dogs, was part of the festivities as well.
In the morning, I was excited to be hiking up into the Rincons. Though they are just east of Tucson, I don't get into them nearly as much as I would like. I hiked the rest of the winding Rincon Valley passage, passing many mountain bikers out on a beautiful Sunday, many who I knew or who recognized me. I reached the Quilter Trail intersection and recalled fond memories of work trips in Saguaro National Park to build this connector trail. It has some of the fanciest rockwork ever.
It was a long day, and after taking in the sunset near some attractive pools of water, I continued on to Grass Shack Campground.
The next day was a big climb to Manning Camp at 8000 ft. I made an enjoyable day of it, taking frequent breaks to snack or take in the view. I had a long lunch with an exquisite nap under a tree. The Sky Islands are incredibly diverse- in just two days I'd gone from Saguaros to Ponderosa Pines. Met back up with Pops and Bars as well as two section-hikers Maverick and El Tractor for sunset-watching and an evening by the campfire.
The next day was one of my favorites of the whole trip so far- the views from the north side of the Rincons are spectacular with fantastic rock formations. The descent was steep but the trail was better than the last time I'd done it in 2008. I reached the cool pools of Tanque Verde Creek and dropped my pack and relaxed by the creek for hours. I saw no one all day.
I hiked on to where the Arizona Trail crosses Redington Road and manged to find a spot that was free of both bullet casings and broken glass, no small feat in this area. It had been windy for days upon end, to be expected of springtime in Arizona, but still mildly unpleasant.
The next morning I was met by my friends Laddie and Sue Cox, who brought me a resupply box for my next piece through the Catalinas. Great to see friendly faces, they are legends that have helped the Arizona Trail Association in many ways through the years. Laddie and I used to be on the same volunteer trail crew, the Crazies.
After repacking, I hiked through attractive juniper-dotted hills toward The Lake and then on toward West Spring. I kept an eye out for Kean Brown's retired horses and was not disappointed. I spent a while visiting with the four horses near West Spring and then made the ascent to the saddle above Molino Basin and then down the other side to the campground. I know this piece of trail like the back of my hand, it used to be my go-to hike long ago when I was recovering from fibromyalgia. What a great thing to have the strength now to have walked here from Mexico.
It was still windy and I got an idea in my head that I would love a hot shower. I have a friend, Tom- another of the Crazies, that lives right at the base of the Catalinas, and so I called and he and his wife Nancy were available to meet me at Gordon Hirabayashi (Prison Camp) Trailhead. Not only did I get my coveted shower, but also an invite to stay the night and dinner on top of it all! It was such a nice surprise.
The next morning Tom took me back to where he'd met me and we picked up another woman, India, for the next leg of the hike. Instead of hiking uphill, Tom offered to drive us up to the top of Mount Lemmon so that we could hike the next piece downhill instead. I didn't have to think twice about that one! I love a good shuttle hike in the Catalinas, it's one of my favorite ways to enjoy my home mountains.
India and I had known each other in the late 90's- early 2000's when I worked as an archaeologist with SWCA Environmental Consulting and had reconnected through her signing up for a couple of the Arizona Trail Trek hikes. She was the only taker for this particular backpacking trip.
The Wilderness of Rock Trail is breathtaking- since hiking it for the first time in 2008 on my AZT section-hike, I have come back again and again. Such a magical place with hoodoos and impossible rock balancing acts.
We filled up our water at Lemmon Creek and then began our descent toward Romero Pass. The trail gives incredible views of Cathedral Rock and Pusch Ridge, even little Sombrero Peak in the Tucson Mountains. Met Maverick again and wished him well on his way to Oracle.
Romero Pass was windy as usual and we looked for bighorns but didn't see any. We switchbacked down the hill and finally reached the Cathedral Rock Trail junction and the canopy of the West Fork Sabino Canyon.
It was too early to camp, so we meandered along the trail a while longer, crossing the dry creekbed. India spotted a fire ring at a flat spot in the trees and we found a home for the night.
The West Fork is home to massive junipers and oaks and we really enjoyed our camp and hike the next morning. The trail then dropped back into the desert and we reached Hutch's Pool. Too cold for a swim, I dunked my feet instead and fondly recalled times spent here with my pool floatie.
The hike out of Sabino Basin on the East Fork and Sycamore Trails went smoothly and soon we were at Shreve Saddle, one of the best views in all the Catalinas. A short downhill later, and we were back at Prison Camp TH. Nice to be done early and have the afternoon off.
My husband, Brian met me and we stayed at Leigh Anne Thrasher's cabin in Summerhaven. Leigh Anne is a great friend to the AZT and she and her mini-donkey Jasmine hiked up and over the Huachucas in Passage 1 with me. It was great to spend some time with my husband, visits are going to be fewer and farther between as I head farther from my home in Tucson.
The next day my friends Wendy and Bill met me in Summerhaven for the hike down Oracle Ridge, but that's a story I'll leave for Bill to tell you in an upcoming guest blog. When I reached the American Flag Trailhead, it marked 200 miles so far on the Arizona Trail Trek- what a great feeling!

If Gov. Pat McCrory and the North Carolina legislators who have failed to repeal or otherwise fix House Bill 2 didn't see this one coming, they just weren't paying attention.
The NCAA made it explicitly clear at the Final Four that if there weren't changes to HB2, the state was at risk of losing NCAA events, including the basketball tournament. Less than six months later, the NCAA showed just how serious it was.
Instead of skipping North Carolina in the next bid cycle, the NCAA pulled events from the state immediately – including the beloved first and second rounds of the men's basketball tournament in Greensboro in March.
McCrory and the legislators were warned. They chose a narrow-minded bathroom bill over basketball (among other, more important principles). The NCAA never blinked. It wasn't waiting for the election in November. It had enough of this nonsense right now.

Having already lost the 2017 NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte because of HB2, North Carolina took it in the basketball solar-plexus again, and in doing so, deprived Duke and North Carolina of a pretty good chance to start the tournament close to home, in front of their fans (and where the Tar Heels are 33-1 in the tournament).
Not only is the damage immediate, in terms of opportunities lost and dollars unspent within these borders, but it has the potential to linger. Events for 2017-18, including the first and second rounds of men's basketball in Charlotte, are probably safe until this time next year. But the NCAA is also in the middle of a bid cycle for events running from 2019-22. If it's willing to pull events from North Carolina with less than three months of warning, there's no chance it's giving out any new ones.
The NCAA was supposed to announce those sites in December. It announced Monday night it would push that deadline back indefinitely, presumably to give North Carolina a chance to get its act together. But the danger is there: If HB2 is still on the books when the NCAA decides on those bids, basketball – and everything else – is going to be shut out for four years. And once that decision comes down, repealing HB2 won't change anything until 2023.
Cary was particularly hurt by this, losing four important events. It had tried for a long time to host the Division I women's lacrosse championship. Gone. It had hosted the Division II baseball tournament since 2009 to rave reviews. Gone. Also gone are the women's soccer College Cup – back in Cary for what would have been the eighth time – and the Division III men's and women's tennis championships.
And why? Over partisan politics, a silly law that doesn't even have any enforcement provisions and serves only to sanction government discrimination against the LGBT community. Just how partisan and silly? A statement from the North Carolina Republican Party actually included this line: “I wish the NCAA was this concerned about the women who were raped at Baylor.”
The ACC should have followed the NBA's lead in July but has been curiously passive, more concerned about ruffling political feathers in its home state than protecting the rights of its athletes and students of its member schools. Late Monday night that changed, with ACC commissioner John Swofford issuing a statement strongly denouncing HB2, declaring that the matter would be taken up at a meeting of presidents this week and, for the first time, taking a decisive personal stance.
“On a personal note,” Swofford said in his statement, “it's time for this bill to be repealed as it's counter to basic human rights.”
The ACC has come late to this awakening. But not too late.
There are a lot of things the NCAA gets wrong. There's no reason why an Olympic medalist should be allowed to keep hundreds of thousands of dollars in medal bonuses when a Charleston Southern football player gets suspended for spending his excess book money on school supplies in the school bookstore. It clings to “the amateur ideal” as a billion-dollar business. Its enforcement of its own complex, arcane rules is arbitrary and erratic (arguably, the only thing left about the NCAA that's truly amateur). And so on.
Once in a while, though, it uses its considerable muscle for good. It took a stand against the Confederate flag in South Carolina and Mississippi. It took a stand against Indiana's anti-LGBT law, getting it amended in days ahead of the 2014 Final Four. And it is taking a stand here, on behalf of its LGBT athletes, fans and anyone else who might feel unwelcome in North Carolina because of HB2.
It used to be basketball and barbecue were the two areas where North Carolinians shared common ground regardless of politics. Now we're down to barbecue.

As WFAA first reported, there are only about 60 911 operators for the entire city of Dallas.
They need about 125 to properly staff the call center.
So the Dallas Police Department is putting dozens of officers in 911 operator jobs with just three days of training in their new positions.
The department and city have been under fire after WFAA first reported major technical issues with 911 involving T-Mobile. People were being placed on hold for more than 30 minutes.
But part of the problem was also a lack of 911 operators. Right now, the department is mandating operators work extra hours and sometimes double shifts.
Operators told WFAA they're exhausted.
So to fill the void, the department is moving about 40 officers who are on light duty or restricted duty.
They will get three days of training and spend a few days with a 911 operator until they feel comfortable enough to answer calls.
Typically it takes four months to train an operator but an officer's peace license can take the place of a telecommunications certificate because they know the codes and the language. All they need is to learn how to work the phone system.
The department did this back in 2012 after Deanna Cook was murdered while on a call with 911 in part because there weren't enough call takers.
There were promises made then that the center would never be understaffed but the officers who were down there were moved out to fill other needs in a department that is also suffering an officer shortage.
Both officers and 911 operators are some of the lowest paid in North Texas so it's difficult to hire people.
The city management and the council have been slow and hesitant to pay more.
The city says it's upgrading the 911 system and plans on hiring more operators.

Stephen Colbert mocked the controversy involving Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE Jr.'s explanation of his June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer who offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE, saying the news comes as no shock whatsoever.
“You could knock me over with whatever you use to knock someone over who isn't the least bit surprised,” Colbert said Monday on "The Late Show."
The host scoffed at the Trump administration's general denial of Russian collusion while the president's son now openly openly admits that he met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer about damaging Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.

“There is no evidence of collusion, or even the desire to collude with the Russians, by anyone in the Trump campaign … is something that was true 48 hours ago,” Colbert said.
He said "it's not a smoking gun, but it is a gun meeting with a Russian bullet to talk about their mutual desire to smoke.”
Colbert brought up the different explanations that Trump Jr. offered for the meeting with the lawyer, including American adoption of Russian children and then eventually looking for damaging information on Clinton. He said the explanation that Trump Jr. offered is “pretty damning.”
He joked that he found it hard to believe that Trump campaign officials Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort would take time for a meeting in the middle of the campaign without knowing details that the meeting could be helpful in their efforts against Clinton.
“We're supposed to believe that during the height of the presidential campaign, on the advice of a guy he met at the Miss Universe pageant, Don Jr. said, ‘Hey Jared, Paul, I know you guys are a little busy right now, but I need you to come to a meeting. With who? I don't know. About what? I'm not telling you.”
This article may center on how those who win the Mayweather sweepstakes but it is a wider point in boxing I have never really understood but intuitively made peace with.
How do fights get made?
There seems to a myriad of reasons and frankly you have to put up with them and just get on with it for the most part.
The reason it was running around my head started a while back when Carl Frampton stopped Kiko Martinez. Frampton has since not managed to get a title shot yet Kiko did and duly took the chance to win it.
The talk lately has been that Kiko would fight Frampton again but this seems to have cooled with perhaps Leo Santa Cruz stepping into the mix. Then this took a side step towards a Cruz fight with Scott Quigg. A bit bizarre all round really but somehow it made sense as only boxing can when it comes to this nonsense.
Some fighters always land the chance to get big fights. In the past Zab Judah, Demarcus Corley and Ricardo Mayorga always seemed to get themselves involved in big fights whether they were relevant or not. Talent is not always enough and in some cases it is clearly a hindrance. I mean no-one wants to go near Guillermo Rigondeaux and frankly who can blame them.
No-one out there can really test him at his weight class, even the dominating Nonito Donaire was beaten with plenty of room to spare. Andre Ward is so far above fighters in his weight class that even one win in two years over an overmatched prospect can't dull his star but big fights elude him.
Network problems and contractual issues seem like a much bigger hindrance. We don't want to admit it but we are never going to see Manny Pacquiao face off with Floyd Mayweather. Some match ups will never happen purely because fighters belong to one stable over another.
Golden Boy and Showtime will keep fighters apart until we start seeing a Game of Thrones or Wire style twist of numerous deaths and Oscar De La Hoya takes over and decides to let everyone fight everyone in a massive Royal Rumble of boxing. Though this may seem closer to happening that ever before let's not hold our breath.
Excitement becomes a very interesting problem sometimes when making match ups. Have you ever seen Miguel Vasquez fight? The man is dull, very dull, but obviously a talented operator. Only Tim Bradley and Saul Alvarez have managed to best him in the ring but no-one is paying to see him or in a hurry to match him with anyone of relevance at the top of end of a weight class with some pretty interesting characters.
This seems to be the area that media is looking into when it comes to Amir Khan and the possibility of facing Mayweather. All of a sudden he is tarred with the brush of being not as exciting as he once was. The fights against Lamont Peterson and Marcos Maidana look a long way away now he is a lot more measured after his three fights under the tutelage of Virgil Hunter.
Records play an interesting part. For a long time Floyd Mayweather would cite the fact that Manny had lost a few times as a reason to not fight him. It never stopped Floyd fighting Oscar De La Hoya, Robert Guerrero, Carlos Baldomir, etc, etc.
He has given first defeats to guys like Ricky Hatton, Diego Coralles and Canelo Alvarez but Marcos Maidana had already lost to Andre Kotelnik, Devon Alexander and Amir Khan before getting the chance so the signals are mixed. Then again Mayweather makes his own rules so you never really know what your record is going to mean in this situation.
Awkwardness is another area where others have struggled. Some fighters are easy to work out and good at what they do and find themselves getting big fight after big fight; Zab Judah especially springs to mind. Others avoid fighters that for one reason or another are awkward.
Paul Williams faced this problem for a long time by being a lanky southpaw with massive work rate and a huge reach. Once he got past Antonio Margarito (awkward in his own right) and won his belt he faced off against avoided fighters like Sergio Martinez and Erislandy Lara and it is a reason he was so applauded as a fighter.
His chances of fighting Floyd if he were still around and operating at a world-class level would be virtually nil. Lara spent a lot of time in the shadows after his defeat to Williams as he was quickly found out as someone to be worried about. It has taken Lara a long time to land a super fight despite his obvious talent.
Celebrity is an odd one. Mexican fighters will always attract a crowd and followers and the British public always stand by their fighters and generally those fighting at world level get the backing.
This tends to put certain fighters in better positions that others. The strange thing with celebrity is that some fighters are just naturally more interesting than others. Take Victor Ortiz for instance. The guy has talent but is obviously bat shit insane. He is exciting to watch because you are unsure what you are going to get.
So far in his career he has quit against Marcos Maidana, hugged Floyd repeatedly until he got punched in the face, TWICE!, disqualified once and recently got knocked out by a guy that rarely knocks anyone out. Coupled with his exciting win over Andre Berto and an entertaining draw with Lamont Paterson you have a guy that seems to find his way towards big fights almost in spite of himself.
All in all, if we look at who Floyd could potentially fight next then the main hurdle is network and contractual. Let's say you get beyond this point and you get to the negotiating table. Well you have to basically make sure you are exciting and have a patchy record.
You probably need a big win to propel you to the fight, Guerrero, Canelo and Maidana all had this. As had numerous before them. Make sure you are not awkward. Since his return Floyd has fought different types of fighters. Robert Guerrero is an all-rounder, which is why Floyd smoked him with such ease, no-one does fundamentals better than Floyd.
Alvarez was a rising young superstar bringing youth and power that seemingly Floyd had never faced. It turned out that he wasn't anywhere near the level of Mayweather. As for Maidana, we get a brawler and a slightly awkward one at that. Floyd had little problems beating both but are these three fighters the cream of the crop that he can face at the moment, probably not.
Trying to predict what Floyd will do next is tough but getting easier due to being able to eliminate those he has already faced. Then a spanner in the works occurs. Maidana might get a rematch and deservedly so, he certainly put up a good showing last time out. He put on the best test Floyd has faced since Oscar.
Then again, if history has taught us anything, match ups are hard to predict so maybe Floyd will be as elusive as ever and come out with another curveball. The winner of Porter v Brook? Amir Khan? Finally Manny? Miguel Cotto again? Maidana rematch?
Hello, dear artists! In this drawing tutorial you will learn how to draw Avatar Aang, from the well-known cartoon.
Very entertaining and high-quality anime, dedicated to the adventures of the boy Aang, which controls the air with the help of magical powers, was published in 2005. Although the story lasted a relatively short time, three seasons, it left colorful and fond memories. Drawing tutorial about Avatar Aang would not be very difficult, or rather, no more difficult than any other drawing tutorials in the style of anime on our website. Let's start, and learn how to draw Avatar Aang with this step-by-step tutorial.
Step 1
The first step is not particularly different from the first stages of drawing lessons of other people not related to anime. As you could know, in the first steps we draw a stickman. Due to the fact that we draw anime character, his head a little more than the head of an average man. As for the rest, we draw the usual stickman – first the head by means of an oval, then the “skeleton” of the body with simple lines.
Step 2
In this step at first we mark up the vertical and horizontal lines of the face. Horizontal lines represent (the top down):
Eye line (located approximately in the center of the area);
Line of the nose;
Line of the mouth.
Under the head draw the neck – long cylinder. Below the neck sketch out the torso, not forgetting to focus on the line from the first step. Draw two circles for the shoulders. Draw the arms in shapes of elongated cylinders and sketch out the hands. The lower part of the body draw as an inverted triangle. The legs should be drawn in the same way as the arms – in the shape of elongated cylinders. And as the final touch of this step draw the feet and sketch out the stick in the hands of Aang.
Step 3
Now it is a short step. Once you have done all the preparatory steps, you need to start adding the details to Avatar Aang. We always start drawing from top to bottom, and this phase of the tutorial will be no exception. Focusing on the face lines from the previous step, draw the main features and, of course, do not forget about the arrow in the forehead.
Step 4
In this step we will finish adding details to the face. Erase guidelines from the face, draw the eyes. It should be something like our example:
Step 5
Ok, now we outline the cape of Avatar Aang. The collar should not be close-fitting neck – as you can see, between this part of the cape and the neck there is a considerable distance. The very same cape should loosely fall down. Use light and wavy lines to draw the cape.
In this same step draw the pants of Avatar Aang. They also should be loose, as well as the upper part of the garment of Aang.
Step 6
This step draws the hands of Avatar that tightly grip the rod (to learn more about hands, visit drawing lesson on how to draw hands). Then circle entire upper torso using confident and precise lines, erase all unnecessary guidelines. Also do not forget to add some fold of fabric.
Step 7
Draw the same actions with the lower part of the torso and legs of Avatar Aang. Erase the guidelines of the previous steps, cleans the drawing, erasing guidelines, and you will get something like our example:
Step 8
And we continue to draw Avatar Aang. Actually, the shadows in this step are very simple – they are presented by single-layer hatching with medium intensity. You can see them on the neck, under the collar, the right of us on the sleeve, and in other areas. It is best to first outline the areas of shadows and then paint them, or rather, to hatch in a single layer.
Drawing tutorial on how to draw Avatar Aang: The Last Airbender came to an end.
President Barack Obama on Thursday delivered a statement reacting to the mass shooting in a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, expressing "deep sorrow" over the killing of nine churchgoers by a 21-year-old white gunman.
"Any death of this sort is a tragedy, any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy," Obama said, with Vice President Joe Biden standing solemnly beside him. "There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace."
The most emotional part of Obama's statement came when he spoke to the broader problems that the shooting reflected: the United States' exceptional history of gun violence.
"Once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun," he said.
"At some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence doesn't happen in other advanced countries," he said. "It doesn't happen in other places with this type of frequency, and it is in our power to do something about it."
Obama's statement came soon after authorities apprehended the suspect, Dylann Storm Roof. He was apprehended by authorities during a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, Thursday morning after a massive manhunt.
CBS's Mark Knoller notes one terribly depressing statistic:
Obama touched on this in his own remarks, saying, "I have had to make statements like this too many times."
The Department of Justice quickly announced that it's opening a hate crime investigation into the shooting. "The DOJ's Civil Rights Division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office are taking part in the investigation, which will work in conjunction with the state's investigation," reports the Huffington Post.
Speaking Thursday morning, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called the shooting a "barbaric crime," and promised, "We will do everything in our power to help heal this community and make it whole again."
Roof's Facebook profile includes a photo of him wearing a jacket pinned with flags from South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) during the era of apartheid.
NRL fans have been slugged with massive ticket price increases for this year's grand final with some seats selling for more than double what they cost last year.
In a blow to the game in its heartland, the NRL has announced the biggest ticket price hike in history for the premiership decider, 138 per cent in some areas of ANZ Stadium.
It will cost $1380 for a family of four to sit in the best seats. Last year it was only $580.
Even the prices for cheaper family tickets behind the goal posts have increased from $200 last year to $425.
Individual seats in the best viewing areas have skyrocketed from $200 last year to $345.
The same seats at tonight's Manchester United blockbuster were just $189.
The NRL tickets are almost double the price of what Australia's most elite football code, the Australian Rugby Union, is charging for Bledisloe Cup tickets at ANZ Stadium.
"It used to be a day out for families, now it's a day for those who can afford it," said one club official. "This should have been done gradually, not in one massive whack."
Get the latest NRL news
Asked for a comment, an NRL spokesman said $1.5 million-a-year chief executive and former banking boss Dave Smith was unavailable to comment. It was left to commercial boss Paul Kind to explain the price rise.
"The investment we have made in grand final week and the day itself with the stadium precinct activity has helped make grand final week an unrivalled experience and the demand for premium seats in particular is overwhelming," Mr Kind said.
The game's most experienced club CEO, South Sydney's Shane Richardson, said the price rises could have been more gradual.
His Rabbitohs lead the competition and his fans are likely to be there on grand final day.
"We have to make sure we don't alienate our fans but it's our premium event," he said.
"We've been under-selling our product for too long. It is a steep hike but the TV deal gave us an idea what our game was really worth."
Souths have always been mindful of looking after their battling fans. They even have hardship membership packages that allow fans to pay for season tickets in instalments. No such offer is available for the grand final.
"We value the grand final as one of the best events. We have benchmarked our prices against other major events and not only are our prices comparable, in many cases they remain cheaper," Mr Kind said.

The Villanova Wildcats had every opportunity to hit the panic button coming into their Saturday afternoon contest with Georgetown. After all, how can a twenty point defeat just over three weeks ago not stir up memories of a similar beat down at the hands of Creighton last season.
Instead, from the opening warmups to the final buzzer, Villanova demonstrated the attitude of a team that believes they are the class of the conference. And for good reason. The Wildcats got the revenge they so clearly desired, beating the Hoyas with a final score of 69-53. Freshman L.J. Peak paced Georgetown with 15 points while Darrun Hilliard II led the way for the Wildcats with 15 of his own.
So what was the difference between the two contests? Coach Wright thinks the answer is fairly simple. "We looked at the tape. We were so bad. Our staff asked ourselves, 'was it our scheme or were we that bad?' So we basically had the same gameplan and just played better and harder."
The rematch showed the makings of an old-school Big East rumble early and often. A four point play from Darrun Hilliard II, three jump balls, two blocks from Dylan Ennis, and one massive crowd made for as energetic of a start as the Wildcats have seen to date. Consecutive three point field goals from Jabril Trawick and Hilliard left the game tied at 5-5.
After being withheld from the starting lineup for a "minor academic issue," Daniel Ochefu stepped into action just before the first media timeout. His 6'11"presence made an immediate impact for the Wildcats, snatching two offensive rebounds and dishing three assists.
Ochefu, along with frontcourt mate JayVaughn Pinkston, did an excellent job of limiting Georgetown's infamous center, Joshua Smith. Two quick fouls and a healthy dose of bodying up limited the big man to only seven minutes and two points in the first half.
For a team that, of late, has emerged from the locker room to start the first half lethargic on offense and disinterested on defense, Villanova had no such concern facing Georgetown. Presented with the task of tracking endless back doors cuts and off ball screens, the Wildcats impressed with well-timed rotations. Dylan Ennis, in particular, continued his push as perhaps his team's best defender. Coach Wright recognized his junior's impact. "Dylan has been great leading us defensively for a while." The junior from Canada never left Smith-Rivera's side, holding the Big East player of the year candidate to 0-4 shooting in the first half.
The shooting woes carried over to the entirety of the Georgetown roster. Coach Thompson III saw his team shoot 9-29 (31%) overall and an abysmal 1-8 from downtown. No Hoya exceeded six points at intermission, with Peak reaching the high watermark on 3-9 shooting.
Back to back threes from Phil Booth (step in from transition), Ryan Arcidiacono (step back off the dribble), and Kris Jenkins blew the game open to a 32-15 Villanova advantage.
Hilliard paced all scorers in the first half, scoring 14 points on an efficient 5-7 from the field. Two of those baskets came at especially critical moments in the game flow. When the Wildcats needed their senior most, he filled the void and then some.
For those keeping track, Dylan Ennis is the most recent Wildcat to join the exclusive Dwayne Anderson "sprint back on transition, dive face first, and pray that you knock the ball free" club. The all-out hustle play led to an easy Pinkston layup.
Villanova stabbed the proverbial dagger with fourteen minutes remaining in the second half. Or rather, Kris Jenkins did. Two offensive rebounds from Ochefu and Hilliard and a beautiful cross court assist led to a wide open look from downtown. Another dish from Dylan Ennis on the subsequent possession, another Jenkins three pointers. Wildcats led 51-29.
Generous passing continued to grace the Villanova box score, where they assisted on 15 of 22 (68%) made baskets. Hilliard and Ochefu notched the highest totals, dishing out 4 and 3 dimes respectively. But perhaps more impressively, nine different Wildcats recorded at least one assist.
While the game might have been out of reach, Georgetown was not ready to back down. Constant chirping between both sides and an extremely physical affair culminated in a double-technical shared by Hilliard and Jabril Trawick after the two exchanged words at half-court. According to Hilliard, there are no hard feelings though. "He's from Philly, he's a great competitor. You wouldn't want to play against anyone else." While the scrappy play continued, it proved to be the highest point of contention for the remainder of the contest.
His impact was limited to only six minutes of action, but much can be said over the quiet presence of Daryl Reynolds. The sophomore, relegated to the bench for the vast majority of the season to date, took the court with 10 minutes remaining after Daniel Ochefu picked up his fourth foul. He provided solid rim protection and was even able to muscle up a layup against Smith on the block. Certainly far from a finished product, Reynolds showed he has the tools to become an effective weapon off the bench.
Despite the sixteen point margin of victory, there were still flaws within the offense. The Wildcat backcourt was able to penetrate the defense towards the baseline, but Georgetown's defensive gameplan called for a quick double before the ball could reach the basket. The strategy resulted in wild, blind passes; Villanova finished the game with an ugly 20 turnovers.
Still though, it's tough to come away from this particular Big East showdown anything but impressed with the Wildcats. By every metric, whether it's the eye test or an RPI ranked 21st, Georgetown is considered one of the best teams in the conference and in the conversation to make some serious noise come March. This is a very good team that Villanova made look, simply put, inferior. When they are on their game, swinging the ball for open threes, sinking their free throws, and causing havoc on defense, this group of Wildcats is one of the top teams in the nation.
Looking forward, Coach Wright is ready to employ the same strategy the Wildcats have used all season. "We're just gonna try to get better tomorrow and Monday, at some of the things we want to do. As we've gotten better defensively, we've slipped a bit offensively. We just hope to get to a point at the end of the season where we can be as good and efficient as possible."
Villanova will look to capitalize on their victory as they take on the Providence Friars. The game will take place on Wednesday at the Dunkin' Donuts Center, tipping off at 8:00 Eastern.
NSA Headquarters
Sometime in October 2013, as the Bitcoin price was headed for the highest point ever -$1147.25, three young men were busy putting the last touches to the newest Bitcoin startup. Their names are Tom Robinson, James Smith and Adam Joyce, and the company they were founding was Elliptic.
As you would expect of any other entrepreneur, they must have thought that they clearly saw the road ahead for Elliptic. Their business plan document must have indicated that they would be one of the leading Bitcoin storage solutions service providers by 2016. Or something along those lines.
However, the London-based company did not stick to its plan for long. Providing storage solution services to individuals and enterprises using Bitcoin was just the beginning. The firm has since significantly changed its business model.
Changed from a Storage to a surveillance firm
It has morphed into a selling Bitcoin surveillance services. And now its primary clientele is the law enforcing agencies in search of the technical know-how for tracking Bitcoin-related criminal activities.
Aside from working with law enforcers, the company is also designing Bitcoin security products for private enterprises. When everything falls in its place, Elliptic is supposed to be the go-to place for brands and individuals seeking to protect themselves from fraud as they engage in transactions involving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
“We wanted to jump in and start getting to know the industry, so we started we something fairly basic……….it was something to get out feet wet and to start to get to know the industry and figure out what was really required,” James Smith, CEO and co-founder, has explained away the change of services on offer.
With the company already counting law enforcement agencies in the US, UK and continental Europe, as part of its clientele, it has continued to attract the attention of investors as well.
Just this week it raised $5 million in a Series A round. Investors who took part included Digital Currency Group, KRW Schindler Private Ventures and Santander Innoventures. Others are Octopus Ventures and Paladin Capital Group.
This followed a seed fund raise of $2million that happened in July 2014 with Octopus Ventures and John Power taking part.
Elliptic is getting more than just capital boost
James Smith has pointed out that, apart from capital, Elliptic is also getting a lot of technical capacity boost from the investors who have acquired a stake in it. "They've got a great advisory board,” he said of Paladin Capital Group (whose managing director is a retired Lieutenant General), “they've got a lot of people who are ex-NSA or FBI or DEA or whatever, which is great as we come to understand that a bit more."
As a matter of fact, and by all accounts, Elliptic is doing very well, and it is an encouraging case. Or is it?
Indeed, it is quite in order for anyone to wonder what this development holds for Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology. This is especially on the backdrop of many people initially adopting the technology because it promised to put them beyond the reach of government's spying eyes.
Is Elliptic redefining Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology? Should it be viewed as a traitor enterprise for making it easy for the government to spy on Bitcoin users?
Of course, an answer to this question depends on how you see Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology regarding its goals. If you see it as just another innovation to improve commerce, then Elliptic is doing nothing to warrant admonition.
It is time to develop better privacy capabilities
However, if you take it as an innovation that is supposed to help secure the privacy of people, then Elliptic is probably a company whose activities you will not approve.
“This demonstrates the great ideological chasm in the bitcoin community,” one redditor has reacted to the news of the capital raise, “People who are looking to make a buck vs. people who care about the type of world that this technology was designed to bring about.”
Indeed, going through various bitcoin forums, there also those who have stated that the success of Elliptic should signal the need to hasten the development of better privacy tools on the Bitcoin protocol.
There is even a Bitcoin enthusiast who hopes Elliptic turns out to be all words but no tangible success. “Hopefully like most other startups in the Bitcoin space (or all startups....?), this company will talk big about their product, but then it will turn out vaporware,” read a post on Reddit.
Even Jon Matonis, Founding Board Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, appeared not to like the idea of the startup raising capital to develop Bitcoin surveillance tools. He shared a link to the news on Reddit with part of the title reading “Tools War on Financial Privacy Escalates.”
It is not all gloom; there must be a brighter side
Nevertheless, even with all this seemingly negative reaction to the news, it is still possible to argue that the success of Elliptic stands to benefit Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology. It is not all gloom.
For starters, the argument that Bitcoin is anonymous and thus attractive to criminal elements is being put to rest. At least, Elliptic is letting everyone know that it is possible for fraudulent and illegal activities to be unmasked.
It is also likely to give confidence to those who want to get involved with Bitcoin that they have a place to go to in case they want to find out whether whomever they are dealing with is not out to scam them.
Even more importantly, though, is for Bitcoin enthusiasts to realize that if there is a way to mount surveillance on Bitcoin users, someone is bound to take advantage of it anyway. That means, if it is not Elliptic, it will be some other startup or even a law enforcement agency.
Perhaps, as someone put it on Reddit, every effort to do bitcoin surveillance should only serve to hasten the development of better privacy tools.

COLUMBIA, Mo. – University of Missouri Head Football Coach Gary Pinkel will resign his position following the conclusion of the 2015 season, and he will remain as Mizzou's coach through December 31, 2015, or until a new head coach is in place, as announced today by MU Director of Athletics Mack Rhoades . Pinkel informed his staff and team this evening, and will address questions following Saturday's game against BYU at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.
Pinkel and Rhoades are discussing a role that would keep him associated with Mizzou Athletics once he steps away from coaching duties.
Pinkel's decision is health-based, as he was diagnosed in May of 2015 with lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancer of the blood. He received multiple treatments in May and June, and after doctors indicated that the treatments wouldn't interfere with his coaching duties, he decided that he would continue to coach the Tigers in 2015.
"I made the decision in May, after visiting with my family, that I wanted to keep coaching, as long as I felt good and had the energy I needed," Pinkel said. "I felt great going into the season, but also knew that I would need to re-assess things at some point, and I set our bye week as the time when I would take stock of the future. After we played Vanderbilt (Oct. 24), I had a scheduled PET scan on Oct. 26th for reassessment, and then visited with my family and came to the decision on October 27th that this would be my last year coaching. I still feel good physically, but I decided that I want to focus on enjoying my remaining years with my family and friends, and also have proper time to battle the disease and give full attention to that," he said.
"It's been an honor working with Gary since I joined the Mizzou family," said Rhoades. "Gary is truly a coaching legend as the winningest coach at two Division I institutions while leaving a profound impact on a countless number of young men. We are extremely appreciative of all that he has done for Mizzou. It's tough emotionally knowing that his fight with cancer is bringing his run to an end sooner than any of us thought. I want to commend Gary with how open he's been with me the whole time, from the first day he came to my office in May and told me about his diagnosis, all the way to now and when he met with me personally on October 28th to tell me he'd made up his mind. He's been nothing but first class in how he's handled the situation the whole way."
"I want to make very clear that I'm not doing poorly, and that this is a manageable disease, but it's one that will never go away," Pinkel said. "So many people have bigger struggles with other forms of cancer and other serious diseases, and I feel blessed that I've got something I can fight and still enjoy a good quality of life. I don't know how many years I have left, but I want to turn my focus to life outside of the daily grind of football," he said.
"Words can't express how grateful I am to the University of Missouri and all of the amazing people who make it up, from the administration to the students and our fans. Obviously, I'm so appreciative to all of my coaches and athletes. Leaving them makes this decision so tough, but I do so feeling good that the Mizzou Football program is in a better place than it was when we came in 15 years ago. I feel that Mizzou is a great job at a great school and has so much going for it that they'll find an outstanding coach to move the program forward," Pinkel said.
Pinkel, 63, transformed Mizzou into a national program after taking over on Nov. 30, 2000, and will conclude his career as the winningest coach in school history. He's amassed a 117-71 record at Mizzou in 15 seasons, and his 190 career wins stand as the 19th-most all-time in NCAA FBS history. Under his guidance, Mizzou won five conference divisional titles (2007, 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014), reached 10 bowl games (winning six) and had five teams post a final top-20 national ranking (including two top-five finishes). His Tigers posted winning seasons in 10-of-15 years, following a stretch where Mizzou had only two winning seasons in the 17 seasons (1984-2000) prior to his arrival. He was named the National Coach of the Year in 2007 by FieldTurf, and won conference coach of the year honors in 2007 (Big 12) and 2014 (SEC).
Two times, Pinkel likely had his Tigers one win away from playing for a national championship, as wins in the 2007 and 2013 conference championship games could have propelled MU into title game appearances. In 2007, Mizzou surged to the school's first-ever number one national ranking since 1960 after a watershed win over rival Kansas at Arrowhead Stadium on Nov. 24, 2007, when the Tigers were ranked fourth and the Jayhawks second coming into the game. That team would eventually end the season with a school-record 12 wins that included a Cotton Bowl title and final national ranking of fourth.
Pinkel worked perhaps his finest coaching job in 2013, one year after Mizzou joined the vaunted Southeastern Conference and suffered an injury-plagued 5-7 season in 2012. Picked to finish sixth in the SEC Eastern Division by pre-season pundits, the Tigers jumped out to a 7-0 record and finished 11-1 and East Division champs. They would go on to a 12-win season, with another Cotton Bowl title, and final national ranking of fifth.
Pinkel's emphasis on molding young men into successful student-athletes was evidenced by the great achievements they had in the classroom. Mizzou has improved its NCAA Graduation Success Rate for nine straight years, and has graduated 97 percent of its seniors the past five seasons.
Getting athletes to the next level has been another mark of success for Pinkel and his program. In his time at Mizzou, 32 Tigers were selected in the NFL Draft, including seven in the first round. Mizzou had 12 players taken in the first round of the NFL Draft in the previous 64 years combined (1937-2001) prior to Pinkel taking over.
Pinkel came to Missouri after spending 10 very successful years as head coach at Toledo (1991-2000), where he amassed an impressive 73-37-3 record and left as UT's all-time winningest coach. Prior to becoming a head coach, Pinkel learned the trade from one of the all-time great coaches, the legendary Don James. For 12 years as an assistant under James at Washington (1979-90), Pinkel helped guide the Huskies to a combined record of 104-37-2 (73.4%) and three Pac-10 Conference titles. He served as UW's offensive coordinator for seven seasons (1984-90), and helped mold one of the nation's most potent offensive attacks.
Pinkel played under James at Kent State University, where he was an all-conference and honorable mention All-American tight end. He received his bachelor of science degree in education from Kent in 1973, and did post-graduate studies at Kent and Bowling Green.
Given the recent cyberattacks on critical infrastructure around the world such as the Christmas 2016 power outage in Ukraine, which left more than 200,000 people in the dark, the task of protecting vital systems and networks has become an issue of pressing global importance.
Meeting that challenge requires improving digital security standards and practices across all industries. It also demands investing in the newest and most promising technologies such as blockchains.
Though Bitcoin gets most of the press, the technology undergirding it – blockchains – has the potential to transform business, and maybe even revolutionize cybersecurity.
A blockchain is simply an online ledger, e.g., a distributed database of who owns what. The database is separated into transactions, called blocks. Once a new block is added to the chain, the data in the block cannot be changed, the digital equivalent of etching a Bitcoin transaction in stone.
From making businesses more efficient to recording property deeds to securing medical devices, a range of huge organizations are investigating in new ways to deploy blockchain technology. Startups in the space have attracted more than $1 billion in funding. Even the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon's experimental brain trust, is researching blockchain technology to "create an unhackable messaging system."
But to date, relatively few firms are exploring the application of blockchain technology to help safeguard critical infrastructure. That needs to change, both on the part of US business leaders and policymakers.
One example of this kind of innovation is already underway. The cybersecurity firm Guardtime uses blockchain technology to secure Britain's power grid, including its nuclear power plants and flood defenses. Guardtime uses blockchain technology known as Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) to detect “unauthorized changes in software configurations [by] ... providing a complete chain of the history of the data that is generated and transmitted.”
Estonia is also using Guardtime's approach and looking into ways blockchains can authenticate marriage records and health data. US critical infrastructure operators and policymakers could learn from Estonia's experimentation, while understanding the limitations of the technology.
The anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto outlined the protocol that leveraged peer-to-peer technology to create Bitcoin. It's a deceptively simple innovation that "set off a spark that has excited, terrified, or otherwise captured the imagination of the computing world and has spread like wildfire." Netscape cocreator Marc Andreessen called the innovation “the distributed trust network that the internet always needed and never had.”
Indeed, blockchains have the potential to, according to the Economist, “transform how people and businesses cooperate.” Such an outcome is by no means predetermined with an array of technological, economic, political, and governance issues to be overcome.
Undoubtedly, there is significant hype associated with blockchains, and they will be improperly deployed in some scenarios where a more traditional ledger might be suitable. However, in security, there is frequently a need for an authentic log of data, transactions, and records. If the authenticity of such records is mutable by a few authorities, then there is concern that targeted foul play can lead to untrustworthy records. Alternately, in some scenarios there are few clear authorities that should be trusted to establish authenticity – and those authorities may not themselves have mutual trust – meaning that a more grassroots approach is necessary.
Still, the promise of this technology, especially in the context of enhancing cybersecurity in critical infrastructure systems, deserves our sustained attention. In other words, a sustainable blockchain edifice will not be built overnight, it will take ongoing attention by numerous stakeholders – including policymakers – over a period of years, perhaps decades. But by starting now, block-by-block, we can build trust in an age that has to date been defined by increasing cyber insecurity.

The Pittsburgh Steelers secondary has sustained more injuries as head coach Mike Tomlin said on Tuesday during his press conference that cornerbacks Cortez Allen and Keenan Lewis both suffered hip flexor injuries in the 34-24 loss to the San Diego Chargers this past week.
With Ike Taylor already ruled out for the upcoming game Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys, Tomlin noted that the availability of Allen for Sunday is in question. Lewis, however, is expected to be able to play against the Cowboys, but both will be limited this week in practice regardless.
The injuries to both Allen and Lewis mean Curtis Brown, Josh Victorian, and DeMarcus Van Dyke will get much more work this week in practice leading up to the game and both are very likely to see action if indeed Allen is not ready.
“Both guys aren't\'t afraid of the competition,” said Tomlin, when asked about Victorian and Van Dyke specifically. “Josh particularly is very ball aware and has good ball skills. DVD (Van Dyke) has played a lot of balls, particularly prior to getting here. He\'s game tested, maybe not game tested here, but I think he played in 14-15 games defensively with 2 or 3 starts in Oakland prior to us getting his services.”
“Both guys have worked extremely hard on the practice field getting an opportunity to compete against the likes of Antonio (Brown) and Mike Wallace and represented themselves rather well. But practice fields, and of course game fields, are two different things. We\'re exited about watching those guys prepare, and more importantly, putting them in a position to where they can execute with great detail as we go into the stadium on Sunday. So it\'s more about what they understand and understand very well and able to display on a game field than maybe what we necessarily would like to run or are comfortable with.”
Allen and Brown both struggled last week against the Chargers, especially on third downs. Victorian only saw a handful of snaps late in the game and also gave up a touchdown on a nice throw from Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to wide receiver Danario Alexander in the corner of the end zone. Van Dyke has yet to see any action on defense this season.
Based on what we saw last week, combined with what Tomlin said on Tuesday, it is likely that the Steelers will be much more vanilla this week has far as defensive scheming goes. Perhaps more press coverage underneath a cover-2, especially in short yardage situations in order to protect the chains better than they did against the Chargers.
“Obviously we're running short at the cornerback position,” Tomlin said. “We'll continue to work with those guys and build a plan around what they're capable of executing and executing at a high level. More than anything it's not about what we call, it's about what we're capable of executing. We'll have that in mind in regards to some of those young corners.”
It is still unclear whether or not Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant will be able to play Sunday with his injured left index finger and it would be a huge break for the Steelers secondary if he winds up not playing.

5 Little-Known Factors Affecting Your Integrity
Two welterweight fights have been added to UFC Fight Night 100 in São Paulo, Brazil, on Nov. 19.
Three days after scoring his first UFC win, Zak Ottow already has his next fight lined up, as the promotion announces him as Sergio Moraes' new opponent in São Paulo. Ottow replaces Mike Graves, who got pulled from the fight after being arrested for domestic violence.
Ottow (14-3) enters the bout coming off five straight victories, capped off by a split decision win over long-time veteran Josh Burkman in his Octagon debut last Saturday in Portland. The 29-year-old welterweight scored 10 of his 14 wins by way of submission.
Moraes (10-2-1) is undefeated as a welterweight in the UFC, but looks to go back to the win column following a split draw against Luan Chagas at UFC 198. Prior to his most recent fight, the jiu-jitsu ace went 4-0 with here finishes.
The second bout officially announced by the promotion features Warlley Alves and Kamaru Usman.
Alves (10-1) was one of the top prospects out of Brazil until he fought Bryan Barberena at UFC 198 in May. A huge favorite in the fight, Alves lost via unanimous decision in Curitiba, snapping a four-fight winning streak under the UFC banner.
Another welterweight talent to enter the promotion through its reality show The Ultimate Fighter, Usman (8-1) is unbeaten in the Octagon after a submission victory over Hayder Hassan and a pair of decisions against Leon Edwards and Alexander Yakovlev.
UFC Fight Night 100 takes place at São Paulo's Ibirapuera gymnasium and features a rematch between Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and Ryan Bader in the main event.

Coroner Releases Causes Of Death For All 58 Victims Of Las Vegas Shooting
Enlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images
All 58 of the people killed in the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 died of gunshot wounds, the Clark County County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner has determined.
Nearly all of the fatalities were caused by a single gunshot wound, though six victims died from multiple wounds. Most had been shot in the head, chest or back. The deaths were all ruled homicides.
In the chaos of the shooting, in which bullets rained down on a country music festival from a gunman on the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel, it wasn't immediately clear whether any victims might have died from trampling as the crowds sought to escape the fusillade.
The shooter, Stephen Paddock, died from a gunshot wound to the head that entered through the mouth. His cause of death was a suicide, the coroner's office said.
Coroner John Fudenberg told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that it has taken more than two months to release the information because his office wanted to be accurate and notify the victims' families first.
"Because of the impact that this incident had on our community, and the attention that this incident received, it became very important for us to ensure that all of the families had the information prior to us releasing it to the public," Fudenberg told the newspaper.
More than 500 people were injured during the shooting, and thousands of others who were there at the Route 91 Harvest Festival have been trying to cope in the months since the tragedy.
One woman who was there, Melissa Barham, recently told NPR's Weekend Edition that since the massacre, she's been sad and depressed and wonders whether anything has really changed since the Sandy Hook shooting five years ago.
"I wake up every morning and I journal," Barham said. "I pick one of the victims and I write down their name and their age and where they're from and then just details about them. And I just think about them."
"And this time of year, the holidays, make it really hard."
An Essay on Collectivist Economics
(By: Bruno Lima Rocha)
This essay is the beginning of an attempt to develop a left libertarian approach toward an economic model, specifically to a model which is compatible with the political formations of Democratic Confederalism, also referred to as Libertarian Municipalism. At this stage the goal is the development of a working set of tools of analysis, and foster learning among the Libertarian Left. To this end I submit this relatively simple text to provide accessible notions for those struggling to build a society based on Democratic Confederalism.

This essay is the beginning of an attempt to develop a left libertarian approach toward an economic model, specifically to a model which is compatible with the political formations of Democratic Confederalism, also referred to as Libertarian Municipalism.
Some ideas have already been defined by others, I will try to explain what is consensus among militants and scholars committed to similar projects. We must accumulate knowledge through real experiences like the ones during the Spanish Revolution (specifically the experiments in Catalonia and Aragón) or during the Russian Revolution (placing primary attention on Ukraine). I recognize that the debate cannot be finished so quickly as the didactic and brief tone of this article, but this first essay part is not meant to close the discussion it relates to, but to open it.
A system of economic institutions, be they placed in a revolutionary project or not, must perform specific functions. It must organize production, distribution, consumption, and reinvestment. An economy fit for a self-managed society must pay special attention to justly remunerating (paying) the workers engaged in production. All of these functions require exchange, which begs the question, what will be the medium of exchange. And as such, we must enter the debate that stalks us like a bad hangover from the 20th century  the debate over the role of currency, of money and market mechanisms. And, if a revolutionary project implementing Democratic Confederalism is to allow for the use of money, a second set of questions have to be answered, delineating how far the currency can circulate, and what aspects of the economy will be subjected to market mechanisms. Will there be a market for goods and services, limited to primarily personal consumption? Or will we allow money to represent also the productive value in the economy, and allows the means of production to be bought and sold? In other words will we allow money to circulate such that we allow private investment for private profit (capitalism at its most basic scale)?
So, the starting point is that moneys role must be limited to exchange of consumer goods. Furthermore, private ownership of either the means of production, or nonproductive speculative assets must not be allowed. Moneys role is to support a locally based system of exchanges and not a tool to produce private wealth.
Relying on the work of Abraham Guillem, I propose the beginnings of a model where by money would be used in the local communes (referred to as cantons), but that each of these communes would have their own currency and no market based exchanges would take place between companies  in a Business to Business scale  in one canton with another. Rather, the economic exchange between cantons would take place through agreement at the canton level, or through fairs for the exchange of goods (goods for goods, as opposed to goods for currency). Furthermore the productive assets would be controlled locally and socially at the canton level. Through these institutional relations a market for consumer goods and services would foster within the canton, but democratic federated social control would prevail at the production level and at the level of exchange between cantons. Furthermore, as specific cantons saw fit, they could intervene in regulating the pricing inside their canton level market. I recognize that key-concepts must be translated to new words, but to avoid representing a false consensus to these new words, we will still use the terms already recognized in hegemonic economics. What we are attempting here is to fashion a new collectivism for a new time and new setting.
We start with the analysis of some premises that may provide direction and parameters to the discussion. As implied earlier this model is explicitly based on and attempting to elaborate the confluences of two coincident theories: social anarchism (not individual anarchism as a philosophical way of thought) and Democratic Confederalism as the leading new (or renewed) theory to produce a different society. In this text I analyze points from the ground and the bottom-up, by placing attention to local institutions.
In the first premise we affirm that Democratic Confederalism is based people operating on local and human scales. For example, let us assume that the minimum scale of society, in which we can find a form of distribution, is a commune of 10 families. Then, we must imagine production at this level, as well as distribution at this level. This basic commune will produce will either share in the spoils of this production through direct planning or will pay workers engaged in this production with a local currency or consumption credit system.
Production at this commune level which is not consumed at the commune level may be traded in exchanging fairs organized by federations to mediate work between communes. Similar fairs for exchange occurred in Ferias de Trueque that occurred in Argentina and Uruguay during the worst neoliberal crisis years.
In this sense I assume that there is a role for the individual, individuality, and creative work. We can combat black markets by institutionalizing open fairs, but never allowing that essential goods are uniquely distributed in the local fairs, but through Canton scale institutionalized distribution.
In the second premise, this same local entity must assure, through a system of self-management, organized by these people, that all essential institutions are sustained by collective work. So, currency  local canton money  exists only as a market for consumer goods and services, and not as private investment capital or private ownership of the means of production.
In the third premise, as we can verify, this theory allows individuals and small groups to produce goods to be exchanged for other goods on a small scale. And, this theory also assures that the essential institutions are not estimated in a monetary calculus, being sustained by the collective. The concept of essential institutions is something decided and classified by the peoples power, peoples assembly, in a participatory way of making decisions.
In the fourth premise, we assure that the money is the accountable unit for exchanging goods (not all goods, but some of them) inside a canton, and not wider than that. So, local canton money is not portable, like financial capital or printed dollars, euros or pounds. It would not be used for banking transactions. For example: if a citizen goes from one canton to another, he would receive an amount of other local canton money for his private use, being assured that essential needs are provided by collective work and social institutions.
In the fifth premise, local canton money must have an equivalence to other local canton money but cannot circulate outside of the federal unit where its value was produced and accounted.
In the sixth premise we assume that time dedicated to social institutions must be paid  remunerated. However, we must not allow large disparities in remuneration between types of labor, so that a full-fledged market in labor does not reappear. It is not a good rationality in socialist terms to think about a difference in wage, but if we consider the role of individual liberty, there could exist some (or a decent amount of) individuals that would not consider full adherence to collectivization.
In the seventh premise we assume that time and dedication are two of the basic theory tools for feminist critiques of political economy, and of course, the basics of feminist economics, considering essentially the question of invisible work, and not compensated working force in capitalism and patriarchate, for example housekeepers, maids and wives. This  in the majority  female work-force produces richness but stays invisible in capitalism. One of the problems is, that they do not get paid, not even a small recognition in the unjust wage system. So, as the project must go on the other way of capitalism, this invisible work must be substituted by collective work and become visible thus compensated. This may require pooling of resources between cantons to assure a minimum level of remuneration of domestic labor.
In the eighth premise, the last in this short essay, we assume that time and dedication must be compensated by local canton currency. The wage must be defined by institutions based on peoples power, coordinated among all cantons and could not reproduce an unjust way of compensating the work force as a mirror for a pyramidal society. As long as the project belongs to a horizontal society, compensation must reproduce the society model, not allowing leaders to live in better material conditions than citizens. To do so, leaders must be renewed and not become a new ruling class.
We will continue the essay in further occasions, growing the complexity of models, trying to finish it in a proposition that would allow the liberated territories to interchange strategic goods even with constituted states, but never allowing these states and private or transnational capital to exploit the territory or the people living there.

U.S. soldiers conduct logistics training with Somali National Army troops in Mogadishu, Somalia. Last week, U.S. special forces accompanied Somalian soldiers during a raid in search of al-Shabaab fighters. Photo by U.S. Africa Command/Twitter
Aug. 28 (UPI) -- At least ten civilians, including three children, were killed when U.S. Special Forces raided a village in Somalia last week in search of al-Shabaab fighters, according to reports.
U.S. Africa Command has not confirmed the death toll but said it is investigating the incident.
"We are aware of the civilian casualty allegations near Bariire, Somalia. We take any allegations of civilian casualties seriously, and per standard, we are conducting an assessment into the situation to determine the facts on the ground," U.S. Africa Command said in a statement."We can confirm that the Somali National Army was conducting an operation in the area with U.S. forces in a supporting role. U.S. forces are in Somalia at the request of the Federal Government of Somalia and are committed to helping Somali forces neutralize al-Shabaab and bring stability to the region."
The U.S. Special Forces team was accompanied by Somalian forces during the raid. The Somalian government initially said no civilians were killed, but later issued a second statement to say that there had been civilian deaths.
"It appears that there were different security operations that took place in the same area," the Somalian information ministry said. "We also understand that there are civilian casualties in which the federal government is investigating to find out the truth about this."
Regional Deputy Governor Ali Nur Mohamed told reporters that "local farmers were attacked by foreign troops while looking after their crops," according to Al Jazeera.
"The troops could have arrested them because they were unarmed, but instead shot them one by one mercilessly," he said.

But the Somalian information ministry said al-Shabaab fighters started shooting at Somalian forces, which led to the deadly firefight.
"Al-Shabab started shooting at [Somalia National Army] forces after our soldiers entered the farm," the information ministry said. "The individuals shooting at the SNA soldiers were al-Shabab fighters. They were not farmers. We talked to the farmers in the area and instructed them to put their weapons in their homes to avoid confusion."
The children believed to have been killed in the raid were between the ages of 8 and 10. A woman was also reportedly killed.

In recent months, the U.S. military has increased its presence in Africa in an attempt to root out terrorist groups like al-Shabaab. The mission reportedly costs $900 million per year, a substantial increase from $300 million in 2009.
"The concern in Washington has been mounting for some time now. The Trump administration is simply reiterating what has been policy, with slight variations," said Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst with the International Crisis Group. "U.S. special forces are already on the ground. Drone attacks have been scaled up."
As the pundits are so fond of saying, politics in Queensland is a little different. The northern state has a fascinating political history as the incubator of the Australian Labor Party and the home of Australia's best known National Party premier.
The state's geography and demography are also quite different to other states. Like Western Australia, Queensland is a vast state that covers millions of square kilometres. Unlike WA, however, Queensland also has a far more decentralised population, with significant regional cities dotted all the way up to the coast to Cairns.
The state's mining and resources sector is of course very strong currently, with huge coal and gas developments underway in central Queensland. These wide open spaces have played an important role in the influence of agrarian interests in Queensland politics, and there are important local constituencies like the strongly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander seat of Cook in the far north, and the irrigation and pastoral seat of Warrego that stretches all the way west to the South Australian border.
Having said that, the bulk of Queensland's voters live in south-east Queensland and that is where state elections are generally decided. Again, though, south-east Queensland itself is quite polyglot, with the capital Brisbane counter-balanced by significant urban centres on the Sunshine and Gold Coasts and in Ipswich. Across the south-east, strong migration from southern states has changed the electoral make-up of many seats, particularly on the Gold Coast, which only a generation ago was a National Party stronghold; in recent times Labor has done surprisingly well there.
Similarly, Ipswich was traditionally a Labor bastion, but in the 1990s came to be known nationally as the birthplace of One Nation. Inner-city Brisbane, by contrast, is gentrifying rapidly and has seen substantial increases in the Green vote in recent times.
The recent history of Queensland politics has been dominated by the Labor Party. After taking office from the discredited Bjelke-Peterson regime in 1989, Labor has only been out of government in Queensland for two short years in the mid-1990s. After inheriting the leadership from Peter Beattie, Anna Bligh went on to win another term in her own right, cementing her position as a respected and determined Labor premier.
But holding power for two decades has inevitably created a lot of baggage for Labor. A string of high-profile scandals have dogged Labor since Beattie's time, including the problems relating to rogue surgeon Jayant Patel, the jailing of former health minister Gordon Nuttall on corruption charges, the problems in the payroll section of Queensland Health (many doctors and nurses were not paid for months) and, more recently, the controversy over the actions of dam engineers at Wivenhoe during the 2011 floods.
Underlying these difficulties have been Queensland's growing pains. Brisbane and the south-east have long struggled with the scale and pace of rapid urban growth, and the government has had a notoriously difficult time keeping up with service delivery.
The pressing need for massive infrastructure investment has pushed the state's finances deep into the red. Treasurer Andrew Fraser had already borrowed heavily to build things such as the second Gateway Bridge, new hospitals and schools, and energy infrastructure.
Then the 2011 floods hit, plus Cyclone Yasi, costing the state an estimated $6.8 billion. The 2011-12 budget was $4 billion in deficit, and the state is not expected to get back into the black before 2015-16.
All of these helps to explain the background to Labor's languishing electoral fortunes. Coming into the election campaign, Anna Bligh and her government were 16 points adrift in one Newspoll and heading for a potentially disastrous defeat. The government is holding up reasonably well in inner-city Brisbane, but in the outer suburbs and regional cities, Labor is on the nose. As a source in the Queensland Labor Party told me this morning, "no-one expects us to win".
The task for Anna Bligh and her government is to try and hold on to as much of the furniture as possible, particularly the key marginal seats around Brisbane like Everton and Ashgrove whose members represent potential future leaders for the state party. But even if Labor holds into most of its seats in Brisbane, it might still lose office if the LNP sweeps Cairns, Townsville and the Gold Coast. If seats in Brisbane start to fall, it will be a landslide.
Bligh has so far burnished her credentials as a strong campaigner, pulling back some of the LNP's lead in the polls and continuing to perform impressively in front of the cameras. The talk of her moving to federal politics will only intensify if Labor loses, but loses narrowly, in what is seen as a very difficult election. She hasn't been helped by some uncomfortable revelations emerging form the floods inquiry, or by the horrible blowback from the federal leadership ballot between Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd; Rudd remains popular in his home state and city and voters in Queensland are far from impressed by the Gillard Government, if the polls are anything to go by.
On the other hand, Labor's ruthless focus on Campbell Newman's family business dealings has clearly hurt the LNP, and is helping Labor claw back support in key seats in Brisbane.
For entirely peculiar reasons, the seat of Ashgrove has become the fulcrum of the election. This middle-ring suburban seat is the one chosen to contest by the Liberal National Party's leader, Newman. This is because Newman is not actually in state Parliament currently. The former Brisbane Lord-Mayor is in effect running for Premier from outside the established political system, and should he fail to win the seat, Queenslanders could be confronted with an as-yet unnamed new Premier the morning after election day.
Newman, a scion of two Liberal Senators and a capable campaigner with a high public profile, had been expected to win Ashgrove reasonably comfortably. But the incumbent, Kate Jones, is young, energetic and reportedly a dedicated local campaigner. The previous Environment Minister and a rising star in the Queensland political scene, she stepped down to devote herself to the Ashgrove contest full-time. The latest poll results have her neck-and-neck with Newman in the intriguing local race.
Should the LNP win, but Newman fail, we can expect considerable internal tension from the notoriously disunified Queensland conservative party. The LNP is itself the result of a merger between the Queensland branches of the Liberal and National parties, and is something of an uncomfortable chimera of both. While the Liberal dominate in Brisbane's green and leafy suburbs, the Nationals still control much of the party apparatus. Infighting cost the party dearly in winnable contests in both 2006 and 2009, and even now tensions are only barely being held in check by the exciting prospect of regaining power after 14 years.
There are plenty of other complicating factors. The new Bob Katter-led Australia Party looks like it could win a couple of seats, potentially giving it the ability to play kingmaker in a election dead-heat. Katter has a strong local support base in far north Queensland and will likely appeal to many of the voters who awarded One Nation 11 seats in 1998. The party has recently aired an openly homophobic television advertisement that has outraged many, but which will nonetheless play well to a certain constituency.
The most likely result is still a win for the LNP, perhaps with Liberal Tim Nicholls as Premier. If the LNP does win, it will leave South Australia as the only mainland state with a Labor government.
After more than a decade of dominating state parliaments, conservative forces are resurgent across the nation. Queensland is also an important state federally, with a growing population that can swing national elections. Tony Abbott and his advisors will therefore be watching the results on 24 March with great interest.
The Obama administration is set to pulverize 6 tons of ivory with a rock crusher in a bid to send a worldwide message that the U.S. does not accept poaching.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will crush the ivory – which includes raw and carved tusks, ornaments and jewelry seized over the past 25 years -- on Nov. 14 at the national wildlife repository in Denver, according to TIME.
“We are taking an important step next week, Daniel Ashe, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said Tuesday. “We're doing that in the hopes of raising the profile of this issue and also to try to inspire other nations around the world to deal with their stockpiles.”
The ivory crushing will be America's first, but it only represents a fraction of the ivory that is available on the global market, TIME reports.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife Fauna and Flora said in 2011 illegal trade of ivory was at its highest level in two decades, fueled by demand from areas like East Asia and the involvement of criminal groups. Ivory trade generates an annual revenue of around $10 billion.
The African Conservation Act, passed by Congress in 1989, has largely banned imports and exports of ivory in the U.S., with shipments being seized at borders and ports.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Cavs intend to sign forward Derrick Williams to a second 10-day contract Wednesday before the team returns to practice following the All-Star break, a source told cleveland.com.
Williams, whom the Cavs signed as a free agent Feb. 9 and is averaging 9.8 points in 22.8 minutes per game, re-tweeted a picture taken of him and a cashier at the Panera in Independence, near the team's practice facility, Tuesday night.
The Cavs' first practice since beating the Pacers Feb. 15 is Wednesday in the afternoon.
When Williams signs, he'll get a 10-day deal for $67,700. If the Cavs need his roster spot to complete a trade by Thursday's deadline, they could just terminate the contract and then re-sign him. If he were to sign for the rest of the season and Cleveland needed room to make a trade, the club would have to consider waiving him -- and losing him.
Williams' first 10-day contract expired over the weekend. By waiting a few days -- the Cavs don't play until Thursday against the Knicks -- they gave themselves more time before having to sign him for the rest of the season.
But all sides, from Williams, to Cavs coach Tyronn Lue, to the front office, to LeBron James, have indicated Williams will be in Cleveland for the rest of this season.
Ask a neuroscientist what the rotarod test is useful for and the answer is likely to be straightforward: it's a test of motor coordination. The rotarod test for mice is a great way to test for strength and balance (especially for screening side effects of drugs in preclinical tests). It also serves as a useful corollary test to run alongside other rodent behavioral tests.

Complex tasks, such as spatial navigation, rely upon a number of brain functions – including motor coordination. Thus, poor performance in strategy-based tasks (especially those indexing levels of activity), need to be carefully interpreted. When testing specifically for a mouse's ability to successfully navigate through a spatial environment (such as in the Morris Water Maze task) it is important to disambiguate a spatial navigation deficit from what might actually be a motor deficit.
So What Exactly is The Rotarod Test?
In this test, the mouse is placed on a horizontal rod, which rotates about its long axis. At least two flanges prevent the mouse from leaving the rod. They are typically 30 cm in diameter (but this can vary) and are separated at 6 cm. The task of the mouse is to walk forward on the rotating rod (rotarod) without falling off. Importantly, the mouse must walk forward in order for a trial to be counted. Holding on to the rod but not walking results in “cartwheeling” and invalidates the trial.
Assessing Performance on The Rotarod Test for Mice:
On testing day, mice should be brought to the testing room and given 30 minutes to acclimate in their homecage. Once it is time to transfer the animal onto the rod, you can:
Hold the mouse gently, bringing it close to the rod (and releasing when it's very near to the slowly moving rod) or
Transfer the mouse onto a dowel and then use the dowel to transfer the mouse onto the rod.
Ten seconds after the animal has been placed, you can adjust the speed of the rod rotation to the desired number. The next step is to note the speed at which the animal falls off of the rod. Two trials are run and two speeds are recorded. Depending on how soon after placement this fall occurs, different steps are taken. Specifically, if the mouse falls within:
1-4 seconds: Restart the trial (a latency this small indicates poor placement)
Restart the trial (a latency this small indicates poor placement) 5-9 seconds: Note the trial but start again at “trial 1”
Note the trial but start again at “trial 1” After 10 seconds: Record speed (revolutions per minute or rpm) at which animal falls
Performance in the task is then calculated as the mean speed (rotations per minute or rpm) between the two trials. For example, if trial 1 was at 4 rpm and trial two was at 12 rpm then performance in the task for this mouse is calculated as (4 + 12 rpm) / 2 = 8rpm.
Potential Problems on The Rotarod Test for Mice?
Although the rotarod test for mice is a relatively straightforward task, there are still several parameters that need to be carefully considered in setup. For example, it is important that:
The rod accelerates at an adequate speed (fast enough to be a challenge but not so fast that it grows into a test of endurance rather than a test of coordination) The rod is high enough above the base (typically 30 centimeters) The rod has ridges deep enough to facilitate grip but not so deep as to result in “cartwheeling” The start speed is adjusted (to 4 rpm) and accelerated up to 20 rpm/min
Notably, parameters must be adjusted according to the specific question at hand. For example, the motor deficit an animal normally shows in response to alcohol can be masked and go undetected if the speed of the rod is turned up too high. Thus, as with any rodent behavioral task, the output is only as useful as the calibrated parameters the experimenter puts in.

"Discovery of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides from Varanus komodoensis (Komodo dragon) by Large Scale Analyses and De Novo-Assisted Sequencing using Electron Transfer Dissociation Mass Spectrometry"
Journal of Proteome Research
In a land where survival is precarious, Komodo dragons thrive despite being exposed to scads of bacteria that would kill less hardy creatures. Now in a study published in the Journal of Proteome Research, scientists report that they have detected antimicrobial protein fragments in the lizard's blood that appear to help them resist deadly infections. The discovery could lead to the development of new drugs capable of combating bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics.
The world's largest lizard, Komodo dragons live on five small islands in Indonesia. The saliva of these creatures contains at least 57 species of bacteria, which are believed to contribute to the demise of their prey. Yet, the Komodo dragon appears resistant to these bacteria, and serum from these animals has been shown to have antibacterial activity. Substances known as cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are produced by nearly all living creatures and are an essential part of the innate immune system. So, Barney Bishop, Monique van Hoek and colleagues at the College of Science at George Mason University wondered whether they could isolate CAMPs from Komodo dragon blood, as they previously had done with alligator blood to expand the library of known CAMPs for therapeutic studies.
The team used an approach known as bioprospecting. They incubated Komodo dragon blood with negatively charged hydrogel particles that they developed to capture the peptides, which are positively charged. With this method, they identified and sequenced 48 potential CAMPs with mass spectrometry. All but one of these was derived from histone proteins, which are known to have antimicrobial activities. Eight were synthesized and tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Seven of the peptides showed significant potency against both bacteria. The eighth was only effective against P. aeruginosa. The researchers conclude that Komodo dragon blood plasma contains a host of potentially viable antimicrobial peptides that could help lead to new therapeutics.

Less than a week ago, Mike Gillis altered the franchise's immediate and long-term trajectory by dealing a rookie heralded as the second coming of Linden, and sending him to Buffalo. Yes, a week ago today Cody Hodgson was a member of the Vancouver Canucks (though he'd just had a meeting with the coach, and indirectly forced the team's hand over three minutes of ice-time per game). Today: he returns to Vancouver to face the Canucks as a member of the Sabres, a hockey team that represents inarguably the crappiest, loser town in North America.
There are Canucks fans who fell so deeply and irrationally in love with Cody Hodgson's shooting percentage and youthful charm, that they'll be rooting for the rookie to play well in Vancouver tonight. I'm not one of those Canucks fans. I for one, hope Vigneault has money on the board tonight: half of it for the team keeping Hodgson off the scoresheet, and the other half for targeting him physically every chance they get.
A more thorough preview, the three keys to the game and underlying numbers after the jump!
I'd give Ehrhoff an ovation if I was in attendance today: he was a rock for the Canucks on their run to the Cup Finals and played hurt in the series against the Bruins. That sort of warrior stuff should earn you a hearty round of applause when you return to face your old team, especially because you are well within your rights as a player to maximize your income as a free agent.
Hodgson on the other hand, basically asked for a trade away from a contender over ice-time. If he was a European or Russian skater he'd be getting absolutely toasted by fans and the press. But instead he's a good Canadian boy, so, it's Vigneault's fault for comments he made about Hodgson's back injury 3 years ago. Ridiculous.
Look, I rooted for Cody Hodgson and Christian Ehrhoff while they were Canucks, and continue to think they're talented offensive players. But now I'm going to root against them, and not just tonight, but forever. Why? Because they prioritized individual goals (ice-time, forty million dollars) over the goals of the team I root for (winning it all). It's not like they're bad people and I don't "hate" them or anything, I just hope they lose tonight, and I hope the Sabres – weighed down by inexcusably bad contract work – miss the playoffs for the next half decade. That's fair, right?
Anyway, the Sabres are a middling team for the most part, but they're on a nice run since the trade deadline, led by goaltender Ryan Miller. Miller has been on fire, making 82 stops on 82 shots this week in two shutout wins over the Ducks and Sharks. Tonight he'll look to continue his run of dominance in the same arena where he earned the nickname: The Millercle.
That's the other fun subplot tonight: Ryan Miller and Roberto Luongo haven't faced each other from across the rink since the gold medal game at the 2010 Olympics. That was almost two years ago, and we all know how it ended – with Sidney Crosby yelling "Iggy, Iggy, Iggy!" and beating Miller low to secure the biggest win for Canadian hockey in a generation. If you're reading this and attending the game tonight, my chant suggestions to you are: "Twennnty – Tennnn!" and "HOWS YOUR SILVER *clap* *clap* *clap-clap-clap*".
For the Canucks tonight, the challenge will be containing Buffalo's speed and beating Ryan Miller. The Sabres are a pretty atrocious possession team, but they have several players who can burn you against the flow of play (Cody Hodgson being one of them). The stand out "worrisome" player for me is Tyler Ennis, who is as good as anyone in the league is at skating around slower defenseman. He could cause fits for the likes of Aaron Rome and Sami Salo.
Ennis also has sweet hands, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him go cross crease on Luongo, and flip one over him when Bobby-Luu falls on his belly at some point this evening. Ennis isn't a great possession player, and my observation is that he doesn't quite know how to use his teammates that well yet, but in terms of his speed and individual skill: he's definitely the guy to watch out for on the Sabres.
Numbers Game
This table includes what we believe to be the best "predictive" team metrics in hockey. Beyond the self-explanatory stats like record, powerplay percentage and goal differential, this table includes: 5-on-5 Goals For and Against Rate, which measures a team's even-strength goal differential on a per game basis. Shot% and Fenwick% are indicators of possession and show us which team is better at controlling play. Shot% and Fenwick% in a tied game state have been proven to be the gold standard for measuring "real" team quality. We'll also include PDO to qualify a team's record – and try to isolate whether or not a particular opponent (or the Canucks) are actually as good as their record indicates, or whether or not they've just been lucky (or unlucky).

Game Notes
The Canucks know better than to mess with success and will go with the exact same lineup that they used on Thursday against St. Louis. That means this blog's favorite player – Chris Tanev – will eat triple o's in the press box for a second straight game.
The Three Keys
Play the man. The Sabres are, I don't want to say soft (it's too pejorative) but they're not the league's biggest team. They traded away Kassian and Gaustad at the deadline, so there's just not a lot of beef left on their roster. The Canucks are the sort of team that can beat their opponents in a number of ways, and against the Sabres they should use their overall team size and muscle to their advantage. Considering how anemic Buffalo's special teams are, the Canucks might be best served playing right on the edge tonight, since they can probably get away it. Get in Miller's grill. It's no secret that Ryan Miller hasn't had his best season, but he's still one of the best goaltenders on the planet. Of course, his glove can't save what his eyes can't see, so getting traffic at the net and blocking his view is essential. The Canucks, and especially the second line, usually make a game plan of getting traffic at the net and setting up point shots anyways, so all I'd like to see them do is double down on that approach. Control the puck, control the game. There's just no way around it: the Sabres are a bad possession team. That said, they've got a fair bit of individual skill on the roster with guys like Derek Roy, Ennis, Nathan Gerbe, Jason Pominville and Hodgson. They've also got one of the leagues elite snipers in Thomas Vanek. The Canucks are a skilled team too, but if they play run-and-gun tonight they're feeding into Buffalo's hands. I'd much prefer to see the Canucks play a suffocating puck-control game, build a lead and then deploy the trap for thirty minutes or so. What can I say, I'm in the mood for some vintage Alain Vigneault tonight.

Does marijuana have medical uses? Which chemicals in marijuana have positive medicinal effects? Which have negative effects? Does using marijuana have negative effects on teenagers' brains? Is it addictive?
These and many other questions are still open to scientific clarification, and for decades it's been the federal government's fault we don't know the answers.
Now, Attorney General Jeff Sessions wants to continue to hinder what limited scientific research can be conducted in America into marijuana's effects. According to The Washington Post, quoting one senior Drug Enforcement Agency official, Sessions' Department of Justice “has effectively shut down” an Obama administration initiative to expand the number of suppliers of marijuana for scientific research.
“The standoff is the latest example of the nation's premier narcotics enforcement agency finding itself in disagreement with the new administration,” the Post reports, noting that “The DEA is no shrinking violet when it comes to marijuana enforcement.”
It might surprise you to learn that, as far as the federal government is concerned, cocaine is less dangerous than marijuana. Cocaine is a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning the government recognizes both a high potential for abuse and legitimate medical uses, while marijuana is Schedule I, meaning it has no recognized legitimate medical uses—just a potential for abuse.
For decades marijuana's Schedule I status has made it incredibly difficult to study. But it's even more difficult to study marijuana than other Schedule I drug like LSD, heroin, and bath salts. Would-be marijuana researchers looking to do clinical studies first need a license from the DEA, then approval from the FDA, and finally access to the single authorized source of legal cannabis, which is heavily controlled by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Whereas there are many sources for drugs like MDMA—in many cases, multiple labs have been contracted to synthesize it—marijuana researchers must be granted access to a supply that is consistently inadequate in both quantity and quality. On top of that, if NIDA doesn't like the study, they may just deny it anyway.
Late in the Obama administration, the DEA took a small but important step toward relaxing the constraints on the production of marijuana for scientific research by allowing other groups to apply for authorization to grow the plant for research. Unsurprisingly, Jeff Sessions' Department of Justice is now stopping that process, according to the Post report, leaving scientific study of marijuana mired in antiquated rules that are more than 50 years out of date.
For nearly a century, marijuana—unlike other, more dangerous drugs—has activated peculiar revulsions in our most prohibitionist lawmakers and federal officials. To Harry J. Anslinger, commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930 to 1962, young people were “slaves” to marijuana, “continuing addiction until they deteriorate mentally, become insane, [and] turn to violent crime and murder.”
When Anslinger found out that professor Alfred Lindesmith of Indiana University began studying scientifically marijuana and challenging Anslinger's hyperbolic claims, Anslinger had Lindesmith harassed by his agents and wiretapped. In 1944, a commission created by NYC Mayor Fiorella LaGuardia published a study challenging the idea that marijuana caused crime and violent behavior. Anslinger attacked LaGuardia and the report's authors viciously, saying he would throw them in jail if they ever studied marijuana again without his permission. And, although the American Medical Association initially endorsed the study's scientific validity, the organization oddly changed course after Anslinger wrote them a letter. The LaGuardia study was now “unscientific,” according to the AMA, and scientists should “continue to regard marihuana as a menace wherever it is purveyed.”
By the late 1960s, marijuana research was still in a sorry state. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 placed marijuana in Schedule I, but, understanding that many questions about the drug were still unanswered, it also provided for a special commission to study the drug. The Shafer Commission, as it became known, recommended decriminalizing personal marijuana use and “increased support of studies which evaluate the efficacy of marihuana to the treatment of physical impairments and disease.” President Nixon—who believed communists and left wingers were pushing “homosexuality, dope, immorality in general” in order to destroy America—of course didn't care. “I am against legalizing marijuana,” he said. “Even if the Commission does recommend that it be legalized, I will not follow that recommendation.” He didn't.
And history has kept repeating itself. In 1988, in response to a petition for rescheduling filed by NORML in 1972, Judge Francis Young, the DEA's own administrative law judge, ruled that “by any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care.” Then-DEA Administrator John Lawn also didn't care. He simply overruled Judge Young.
Enter Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has slid neatly into the role formerly played by Anslinger, Nixon, and Lawn. It's a part in a tragicomic farce with Groundhog Day elements. Committed drug warriors ignore and block legitimate scientific research and then cite the fact that science hasn't proven the drug “safe” as a reason to continue Schedule I prohibition. Rinse and repeat.
Until Sessions and others of his ilk stop living in the past, we will continue to be inexcusably ignorant of marijuana's harms and benefits.

Low-wage workers in Oakland are getting a raise starting on Monday. The current $9 an hour minimum wage will increase nearly 36 percent to $12.25 an hour. It will be the highest minimum wage in the Bay Area.While workers applaud the move, some businesses and restaurants say the increase will force them to raise prices, hire fewer workers, or give their employees fewer hours.Some restaurants will switch to a 20 percent service charge in lieu of a tip, with part of the fee going towards the restaurant's revenue.It's already being tested by some restaurants in the Uptown and Rockridge districts.Eighty-two percent of Oakland voters approved the wage increase last November. That includes Sal Bednarz, owner of Actual Caf on San Pablo Ave, who backed the measure even though his payroll will jump by 15 percent and he will have to raise prices."The costs are going up because it is necessary that they go up because it is necessary that we treat our workers fairly," he said. "Eighty-two percent of voters voted for this measure. Hopefully 82 percent of those voters will come with us and spend a little bit more on their meals."The minimum wage law also gives Oakland workers up to nine paid sick days a year.
The railway men came with heavy equipment earlier this month. This was not a sneak attack; the gardeners had been warned. A backhoe clawed at the brambles. Some vegetable plots were ripped to pieces. Lettuce lost their heads. Zucchinis were terminated. Tomatoes squashed.
The hammer had come down. War was declared on old Arbutus Corridor.
Canadian Pacific Railway Co. owns the corridor, a narrow, 11-kilometre strip of track and right-of-way that cuts through Vancouver's leafy west side. Trains haven't been seen along the corridor since 1999. No matter, the CPR says “track improvements” are needed. Vegetables don't fit the picture. The vegetables must go.
The CPR has plans for the line, or so it would have people here believe. What's coming? “General freight rail operations,” says a spokeswoman in Calgary, where the company is headquartered.
No one really believes that. The CPR has been calling folks at Vancouver City Hall, offering to sell the corridor for $100-million. The city countered with a $20-million offer, which it considers fair.
The CPR didn't bite. Stalemate.
With negotiations stalled, the railway launched its “track improvements” program and started clearing the corridor, starting at the southern end. A handful of gardens came down. Then the company announced it would be spraying the corridor with herbicides.
There have been protests all this month. And stories about families, their vegetables and their beloved garden plots.
The tracks have a history. The CPR was given title to the corridor in 1896. Rails were fastened six years later; freight trains crawled up and down the line. Gardeners first appeared in 1942. It was wartime, and folks needed food. They built “victory gardens.” The war ended, but the gardeners never left. Vegetable farming has continued in one form or another to this day.
After its last locomotive rumbled down the track in 1999, the CPR looked at other opportunities, thinking it would see portions of its right of way developed with housing and commercial buildings. The city demurred, claiming that while the railway owns the corridor, a municipal bylaw restricts its use to public transportation and as a greenway. Civil proceedings commenced; eventually, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. In 2006, the bylaw was upheld. For good.
Some 350 community garden plots along the corridor are officially registered with the city. Permits are available to anyone with enough patience to wait for an opening. That can take years. Some have decided not to wait, and have created their own ad hoc plots along the corridor.
It's a pleasant space, a unique public amenity in a densely populated city. Gardens are just part of the corridor's appeal; the route serves as a convenient walkway, for anyone to use. Would it be best for the corridor to be left as is, for public enjoyment? Perhaps.
While the CPR has every right to demand a hefty price for the sale of its property, gearing up for “general freight rail operations” is disingenuous, at best. Pushing around peaceful citizens who grow produce on the corridor is worse. “It's mean-spirited,” says Paul Kendal, a local resident who tends a registered garden along the corridor.
Mr. Kendal and his wife, Kate Wilczak, helped organize a brain-storming session for threatened gardeners, held on Thursday night. About 50 people showed up. They heard first from the city's deputy city manager, Sadhu Johnston. He's tasked with making Vancouver the “greenest” city on Earth.
He needn't have bothered, but Mr. Johnston declared his bias at the start: “This issue is near and dear to my heart,” he told the vegetable activists. “I personally have beehives in my backyard. I grow as much food as I can.”
The rail corridor is “a magical little nook on the city,” Mr. Johnston said, with “no commercial possibilities for development. … We're not interested in [the CPR] hijacking and bullying us.”
That got everyone fired up. After some more bee talk — Vancouver is home to dozens of bee species, many of them threatened — certain garden-saving strategies were discussed.
There persists in Vancouver a feeling the Arbutus Corridor gardeners are just a bunch of squatters, freeloading on private land, someone noted. “We need to counter the naysayers who say we're privileged west-side people,” declared the vegetablist.
Another man piped up. “The left wing has not come to our support,” he said. The reason? Saving community gardens in Vancouver plays second fiddle to ending homelessness.
Some folks scratched their heads. Food for thought, but time was running short. The group hived into special task force units, and everyone got down to work.

Up to 100 militants die in Herat during the latest insurrection against group's leader, further complicating peace efforts
Dozens of militants have been killed during clashes between rival Taliban factions in the latest outbreak of an insurrection against the group's leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, which flared up last year when the movement's founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, was announced dead.
Up to 100 fighters were killed in the Shindand district of Herat in western Afghanistan, officials told local media on Thursday, when followers of Mullah Mohammad Rasool clashed with Mansoor supporters.

The hostilities are complicating efforts to revive peace talks. A recently established group of Afghan, Pakistani, American and Chinese officials have invited the Taliban to discuss peace, but for the moment the militants seem preoccupied with fighting each other, and the government.
In an unpublished roadmap seen by the Guardian, the four countries call on all Taliban factions to join the reconciliation process. A big question, meanwhile, is whether the Taliban see any benefit in pursuing peace at a time when they may feel they are winning.
The Taliban control more territory than at any point since 2001. In September, they took a provincial capital, Kunduz, and are threatening another, Lashkar Gah in Helmand.
Diplomats in Kabul acknowledge that while informal talks could happen soon, peace is still far off.
“Talks are a key first step, but I don't see negotiations before the 2016 fighting season is over,” said Franz-Michael Mellbin, the EU's special representative to Afghanistan. “The government will have to convince the Taliban that they can deny them success on the battlefield.”
Doing that might require a more robust international military effort. Afghan government forces are struggling to even maintain status quo, suffering unprecedented casualties and desertions.
“If the US say they will fight [the Taliban] if they don't come to the table, and the Taliban believes them, they will come,” said Ismail Qasemyar, the international relations adviser to the high peace council, a non-governmental body formally leading negotiations.
In a recent statement, the Taliban declined to take part in peace talks, “unless the occupation of Afghanistan is ended, blacklists eliminated and innocent prisoners freed”. But according to Qasemyar, the Taliban know those demands cannot be met before actual negotiations.
“It's a game,” he said. “They are trying to show they are independent of Pakistan.” Pakistan has long been known to harbour Taliban leaders, which its top foreign adviser, Sartaj Aziz, admitted last week.
A former top Taliban official emphasised that the Taliban have become more autonomous over the past decade.
“Pakistan have influence over the Taliban, but Taliban are not under the command of the Pakistani authorities,” said Abdul Hakim Mujahid, the former unofficial Taliban representative to the UN and member of the high peace council. A sense of autonomy in the Taliban is necessary for reconciliation to work, he said.
“Dragging the Taliban to the negotiating table will not bring lasting peace,” Mujahid said.
Mellbin pinned his hopes on the upcoming donor conferences in Warsaw and Brussels later this year. International commitments to support Afghanistan could give the parties time and incentive to get the peace process going. It would be folly to expect peace already this year, he said, “however, five years is certainly a realistic timeline”.
AMES, Iowa – Former Iowa State women's basketball player Monica (Huelman) Zaruba, the first recruit under head coach Bill Fennelly , passed away on Saturday night. She was 40 years old.
"Our Iowa State women's basketball family was shocked to learn about the sudden passing of Monica Huelman Zaruba," Fennelly said. "Mo was our first recruit and started the Iowa State Way. She hit maybe the biggest shot in Cyclone women's basketball history when we upset UConn. Mo was loved by her teammates, coaches and fans. The sadness we feel is numbing and it hopefully will encourage us to all celebrate life and family just as Mo did. All of us are praying for her husband Terry and her parents."
Zaruba, a native of Vinton, Iowa, competed for Iowa State from 1996-2000, appearing in 125 games for the Cyclones. Zaruba amassed 513 career points, 436 rebounds and 98 assists and shot 50.2 percent from the floor during her time with the Cyclones.
One of Zaruba's most memorable moments as a Cyclone came in the Sweet 16 in 1999, when Iowa State faced top-seeded UConn. The then-junior netted a 3-pointer with 5:26 to play to put the Cyclones ahead of the Huskies for good. Iowa State would go on to win 64-58, sending the Cyclones to their first Elite Eight appearance in school history. She was also inducted into the Iowa High School Hall of Fame in 2012.
Zaruba graduated from Iowa State with a degree in horticulture in 2000. She most recently resided in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and worked for Country Landscapes.
Zaruba is survived by her husband, Terry.
Pop Culture Happy Hour: 'Silicon Valley' And 'Bob's Burgers'
Enlarge this image toggle caption FOX FOX
We're so excited that this week's show brings Danielle Henderson to our fourth chair. You might remember Danielle from the chat she and I had about American Crime earlier this spring, and she's back to talk to us about the HBO comedy series Silicon Valley, which just kicked off its third season. We chat about the writing style, the ensemble, the surprisingly nuanced comedic treatment of billionaires, and lots more.
In our second segment, we've got a special segment: Stephen Thompson sat down to talk to Loren Bouchard, one of the creators of Bob's Burgers, about a new cookbook that translates some of the imaginary burgers from the show into reality. At the bottom of this post, you'll find some highlights from their interview to whet your appetite.
As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about getting to use a new tool to have conversations with folks at NPR about moments in the news. Glen is happy about a Twitter account he loves and a show he calls a "spiritual cardigan." Danielle is happy about a documentary that led her to a book and to a habit we encourage you to embrace. And I am happy about a documentary and a comedy I discovered at a recent film festival.
Find us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter: me, Linda, Glen, Danielle, and producer Jessica.
On why the Bob's Burgers team decided to make a cookbook
"When the show reaches just a certain number of years in, you can crap out a bunch of products if you're so inclined, and we really didn't want to do that. We didn't want to put out a novelty cookbook that was just cashing in on the few people who might pick it up as an impulse purchase. If we were gonna do it, we wanted to do it well. And so his [Cole Bowden's] blog became suddenly the potential heart of this thing, where all his work would be what we would base it around. And he himself was, you know, adding ingredients and inventing these things because all he knew from the blackboard on the show was the dopey name we'd given it. Yeah, the one ingredient we'd managed to think of a joke for."
On why passionate people make good characters
"Obviously, we're drawing on our own experiences... There's this creative urge which you can't quite understand, and if you're a kid and you're, you know, up in your room, and you're drawing compulsively hour after hour and you just can't stop drawing, there's nothing knowable about it... As I got older and I started wanting to tell stories, in a way, the characters that are most interesting to me are those people. It's like figuring that out about myself and about the people I work with, that urge to create, and that passion... it seems like to me a really fun and a great characteristic to give a character."
On changing a character from a boy named Daniel to a girl named Tina
"The original 12 minutes we produced for Fox were almost exactly the first 12 minutes of the pilot that aired on TV, with one significant difference: Dan Mintz was a 13-year-old named Daniel... The dialogue was exactly the same. We switched the sex, and we had to switch only one word, which was, um, 'balls.' ... The network had one thought. They were sort of picking at this possibility that maybe the oldest child wasn't differentiated enough. He didn't... They use this word in Hollywood which I kind of like, even though it has a little stink of Hollywood-ism on it, but they say, 'He wasn't popping.' ...
"I think on some level we just lucked into a great trick. I've heard this before that writers can sometimes get stuck writing female characters, and one trick is to write it like it was a male character. It's just a weakness of writers; it's not a weakness of any gender. It's just, writers are unimaginative like all of us. We fail sometimes to really find what's interesting about a person when we're trying to create them, and we got lucky. So we created the drawing of Tina, much as she looks now, and we put some test dialogue in her mouth ... and then we also used some stand-up from Dan Mintz. ... To their credit, they went for it. They said, yeah, she's... That's a great answer to the question, 'How do you make the oldest child pop?'"

Zeitenlik (Greek: Ζέιτενλικ, Serbian Cyrillic: Зејтинлик) is an Allied military cemetery and World War I memorial park in Thessaloniki, the largest military cemetery in Greece. It contains the graves of circa 20,000 Serbian, French, British, Italian Russian and Greek soldiers and Bulgarian POWs, who died in the battles on the Salonika front during World War I. The largest part of the complex is the Serbian Military Graveyard, which contains the remains of c. 7,500 soldiers.[1] The French sector contains the remains of 8,000 French soldiers.[2] The Italian sector holds about 3,000 graves; the British sector holds about 2,000 graves, and there is also the Russian sector with about 400 graves.[2] There are also graves of Bulgarian POW, such as graves of fallen Greeks transferred from the battlefields of Kilkis.
The complex is located on the place where the Main Hospital of the Serbian Army was located during the war.[1] The name comes from the Turkish word Zeytin which means Olive. It can be translated as Olive plantation. It is located on Lagkada street, about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) from the city centre of Thessaloniki.[3]
History [ edit ]

The agreement establishing the Allied cemeteries was signed on 20 November 1920, by the Greek Governor-General of Thessaloniki, Anastasios Adossides, and allies Vojvoda Živojin Mišić (Serbia), General Jean Noël Boucher (France), Field Marshal George Francis Milne (England) and Colonel Curgio Giamberini (Italy). The Greek government bought the land where the cemetery would be created and ceded it to the allies in usufruct, while maintenance of the cemeteries was left to their governments.
The project began in 1926, when Savo Mihailović was appointed to head the group that was tasked to collect the remains of warriors scattered across a wide area where the battle raged on the Salonika front. They visited over 250 cemeteries to find allied soldier graves and move them to the new cemetery space.
The conceptual design of the Serbian military cemetery was selected that same year in a contest, and the design of the architect Aleksandar Vasić was chosen and further elaborated by Nikolaj Krasnov. All materials for the construction of the cemetery came from Serbia, where it was also first processed. Therefore, the preparations for the start of construction lasted until 1933 because of the need to prepare large quantities of trimmed stone for the construction of the mausoleum, chapel and charnel house, and about 2000 marble crosses.
Finishing work began in 1933 under the direction of architect Budimir Hristodulo, one of the 1300 Corporals. It was concluded at the end of 1936, and on 11 November 1936, on Armistice Day of World War I, the mausoleum, chapel and crypt were officially sanctified. Greece gave free land to build a complex of 70,000 m², and all material and work on the cemetery was released from customs and exempted from tax.
Stone from the Momin Kamen[4] quarry, which is located near the village of Džep in Serbia was used for building the mausoleum and crosses, granite from Kadina Luka near Ljig was used for the slabs, and the cement was from Beočin. Cypress trees, delivered as young seedlings from Hilandar, were planted around the Serbian part of the cemetery. The mosaic in the chapel, which incorporates motifs from medieval Serbian frescoes, is the work of the Greek artist Voila.
During World War II, the burden of preserving the cemetery fell onto the guard Đuro Mihailović. In spite of the war, the teen managed to preserve the cemetery and prevent Nazi looting of books and relics.
Thanks to the efforts of the Secretariat for the Culture of Serbia, funds for the restoration of the cemetery were collected. Works were carried out from 25 September to 22 October 1969, and apart from the renovation of the vast complex, a sidewalk was built in front of the entrance to the cemetery, and an iron inscription saying "Serbian military cemetery" was placed on the front gate.

Cemetery keepers, the Mihailović family [ edit ]

The first keeper of the graveyard was Savo Mihailović, who was the head of the group that was responsible for the exhumation of Serbian soldiers and their transfer to the area of the future military cemetery.[5] Mihailović, a Serb from Grbalj, collected the bodies of his dead friends and comrades, and then protected and guarded the cemetery until his death in 1928. He lived in a house built for him and his family, inside the cemetery proper. After his death, his remains were also buried in Zeitenlik. He was succeeded by his son Đuro Mihailović, who succeeded in preserving the cemetery and relics from Nazi looting during World War II. Đuro died in 1961 and was buried along with his father on Zeitenlik.[5]
Today, the keeper, host and curator of the Serbian Military Cemetery at Zeitenlik is Đorđe Mihailović, Đuro's son and Savo's grandson, who lives in the keeper's house with his wife and daughter.[5] Although new burials at Zeitinlik are forbidden, a special decree was issued that allows Đorđe to be the last person buried here when he dies.[5]

Whistleblower Edward Snowden received several standing ovations in the Swedish parliament after being given the Right Livelihood award for his revelations of the scale of state surveillance.
Snowden, who is in exile in Russia, addressed the parliament by video from Moscow. In a symbolic gesture, his family and supporters said no one picked up the award on his behalf in the hope that one day he might be free to travel to Sweden to receive it in person.
His father, Lon, who was in the chamber for what was an emotional ceremony, said: “I am thankful for the support of the Right Livelihood award and the Swedish parliament. The award will remain here in expectation that some time – sooner or later – he will come to Stockholm to accept the award.”
Snowden is wanted by the US on charges under the Espionage Act. His chances of a deal with the US justice department that would allow him to return home are slim and he may end up spending the rest of his days in Russia.
His supporters hope that a west European country such as Sweden might grant him asylum. Members of the Green party called for him to be given sanctuary in Sweden.
Philanthropist Jakob von Uexküll, who established the award in 1980, told the parliament: “So Mr Snowden, your Right Livelihood Award is waiting for you. We trust that Sweden will make it possible for you to collect your award here in Stockholm in person in the very near future.”
The awards jury, in its citation, said Snowden was being honoured “for his courage and skill in revealing the unprecedented extent of state surveillance violating basic democratic processes and constitutional rights”.
The chamber was filled with members of parliament from almost all the parties as well as family and friends of those receiving the award.
The Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger, was also among the recipients. The jury citation said his award was in celebration of “building a global media organisation dedicated to responsible journalism in the public interest, undaunted by the challenge of exposing corporate and government malpractices”.
In his address, Rusbridger said: “One of the challenges Snowden poses for us is the recognition that there is no such thing as the public interest. No such thing as one single, monolithic interest that overrides all others.”
Security from terrorists is a public interest but freedom of expression and a right to privacy were also in the public interest. “So there are many – often conflicting – public interests, not one,” Rusbridger said.
Though most states in the country adopted “Common Core” education standards in 2010, many American parents still know little about them.
At the same time that teachers' unions have joined forces with the institutional left on many issues, and more of children's basic needs are being met by public schools via meal programs and, more recently, Obamacare's school-based healthcare centers, uninformed parents could be abandoning significant parental rights to education by not questioning what is at the heart of the Common Core.
Joy Pullmann at The Heartland Institute finds the public's lack of knowledge of the Obama administration's Common Core initiative particularly disturbing. In an era in which those who value Constitutional limits to government have been critical of the Obama administration's overreach in many areas, Pullmann observes that the cause for concern is warranted:
Debate should never be discouraged by appeals to what experts say they know or claims that the “general public” is somehow too stupid or lack the proper credentials to make informed choices. Parents whose children will be subject to these new requirements and citizens who will pay for the standards, associated tests, and myriad related initiatives deserve to know what they contain and to have a say in whether states adopt them.
Joel Klein, former chancellor of the New York City public schools and current vice-president at News Corp., and Sol Stern, author of Breaking Free: Public School Lessons and the Imperative of School Choice, have both been around the block enough in the area of education. Both men support the Common Core State Standards and are critical of both conservatives like Pullmann and the Heritage Foundation, as well as “some hard-liners on the educational left” who oppose them.
In a Wall St. Journal op-ed in May, Stern and Klein described Common Core as “one of the most promising education initiatives of the past half century.” They went on to say that, “if implemented properly, they [Common Core standards] can better prepare students for college-level work and to gain the civic knowledge that is essential for democracy to prosper.”
Stern and Klein took to task the “progressive education thinking that has dominated the public schools over the past half-century,” and the pedagogical approaches favored by liberals (i.e., “child-centered; “teaching for social justice”). They argued that these educators on the left are opposed to Common Core's “rigorous academic content” that threatens to “undo” the progressives' “watered-down version” of education.
At the same time, Stern and Klein claimed to be “puzzled” over the “fervid opposition to the Common Core by some conservatives, including tea party activists, several free-market think tanks and, most recently, the Republican National Committee.”
One of the primary objections by conservatives to the Common Core standards is the view that the Obama administration is intent on controlling what is taught at each grade level in schools across the United States. According to the Heritage Foundation, the Obama Department of Education “has used its flagship ‘Race to the Top' competitive grant program to entice states to adopt the K-12 standards developed by a joint project of the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO).”
Heritage goes on to say that, in its 2009 Blueprint for Education Reform, the Obama administration suggested that adoption of the Common Core standards could be a qualification for states wanting future Title I'm funding for low-income schools. Many conservatives considered this an unconstitutional overreach by the federal government into an area reserved historically to the states.
In response to this objection, Stern and Klein argued that the Common Core standards were, in fact, written by both the NGA and the CCSSO, with financial backing of private foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, an arrangement they refer to as “constitutional federalism at its best.”
Claiming that the federal government is not “forcing” states to comply with the standards – else, how could some of them opt out of them – Stern and Klein asserted that conservative critics have overlooked that Common Core supports educating students about the nation's founding and the basis for constitutional government in the United States.
Pullmann, however, disagrees, and points out that all math and English textbooks, as well as national tests – to be taken by all students – are expected to align with the Common Core, thereby pressuring states into adopting them if they want their students to “succeed,” based on what is viewed “successful” by the Obama administration.
Pullmann asserts that some advocates of Common Core insist that the standards are “not a curriculum” and that they will promulgate “an academic curriculum based on great works of Western civilization and the American republic.”
She argues:
But the standards are being used to write the tables of contents for all the textbooks used in K-12 math and English classes. This may not technically constitute a curriculum, but it certainly defines what children will be taught, especially when they and their teachers will be judged by performance on national tests that are aligned with these standards.
Adding up all the intricacies of the Common Core standards, Pullmann sees no other way to characterize them other than as “a national takeover of schooling.”
She cites research in the Journal of Scholarship and Practice that demonstrates how the standards will infiltrate every aspect of K-12 education. They will “form the core curriculum of every public school program, drive another stronger wave of high stakes testing, and thus become student selection criteria for K-12 school programs such as Title I service, gifted and talented programs, high school course placement, and other academic programs.”
Pullman states that the “domino effect” of the standards will hit teacher evaluations, since many states tie teacher ratings to students' performance on tests. In addition, Common Core will affect school choice, since many states that have passed school choice laws require private schools to administer state tests.
Furthermore, college entrance exams, including the SAT and ACT, would now correspond to Common Core, an aspect that would also impact homeschoolers who desire entrance to college. Would they, too, need to use the Common Core standards in order to successfully pass college entrance exams?
Pullman summarizes, “People who characterize Common Core as anything other than a national takeover of schooling are either unaware of these sweeping implications or are deliberately hiding this information from the public.”
How CharityWater Raised $150 Million Dollars

I have been following CharityWater for years. As a content strategist (and former television producer), I am fascinated by the way in which the organization uses storytelling and specifically high quality videos to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. And raising donations today is no easy task, especially in this day and age. Who hasn't seen the guilt driven commercials of starving children in Africa or abused dogs and cats in cages, with pleas to help?
It doesn't matter whether you're trying to sell a piece of software or raising money for your non-profit; the goal is the same — to create authentic long-lasting relationships with donors, so that they will continue to open your emails, read your blogs, visit your website and donate to your cause.
The question is whether a banner ad, reading a blog or the simple request of asking people to give money is sufficient to build the foundation for that relationship. Is the act of pulling out a credit card sufficient to bring them back again or to share their experience on Facebook or Twitter?
CharityWater doesn't think so. They have raised over $150 million dollars over the course of the last 5 years by focusing on creating memorable experiences for their fundraisers, which in turn develops long-lasting relationships with its donors. It understands that every time donors have a positive experience creating a fundraiser or competing in a marathon for their charity, they will share this experience (and content) with their friends and family, which in turn reignites the fundraising cycle.
CharityWater doesn't believe in traditional marketing. In fact, they don't spend any money on radio, TV, print or direct mail. They believe in the power of content, specifically, that when people are inspired by content (videos), they will share it. They believe shareable content is much more powerful than a piece of direct mail ever will be and has a higher return on investment.
Paull Young, who ran its content marketing initiatives for years before leaving to manage strategic partnerships for Instagram, deserves the credit for much of the genius behind CharityWater's fundraising success. He and CharityWater have in essence reinvented the way a non-profit engages the public; first inspiring people to join its cause through narrative videos, and then distributing these shareable videos through social media. Once people see these powerful stories, they embrace them and make them “their stories”, taking them to the world through their own fundraising efforts.
Paull describes the strategy as a three-pronged approach:
Inspire-Activate-Experience
Step One: Inspire
CharityWater inspires people through content (videos) which it uses to create an emotional connection to its brand. The videos are then promoted via their social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube and Twitter which drive people back to CharityWater's website.
Step Two: Activate
Once a prospective participant arrives at CharityWater.org, an online platform embraces the user, which gives them the tools and resources to get involved in multiple ways.
For example, Jaimee just ran in the Boston marathon and donated the money from her run to CharityWater, using the tools on their website. She has already raised over $3,000 dollars for the organization. She has a page on the website where you can see everyone who has donated, and has also posted her fundraising campaign on her own Facebook page. Jaimee is emotionally connected to raising money for the water crisis, and has become a brand ambassador for CharityWater. As each fundraiser shares their campaign with their respective personal networks, via word of mouth and online, the branding multiplies.
Step Three: Experience
Next CharityWater documents each fundraiser's experience so that they can see exactly where their money was spent. They call it “social proof”. This ensures that each donor feels aligned with those they are helping. Every person who donates gets a report (with exact GPS coordinates) on the water wells they funded. They see pictures of the wells and of the people they helped.
“People are good, but people are busy. You've got to cut through. Inspired people when they're given a platform will do amazing things”. — Paull Young, then CharityWater Director of Digital Strategy
Based on my evaluation of CharityWater's fundraising strategy, here are the 8 key components that are critical to its success:
1. Create Compelling Story Driven Content
Use video, images and text to tell inspirational stories to bring your cause to life. CharityWater does a stellar job of producing beautiful films, weaving together gorgeous imagery and detail, and drawing the viewer in. It then combines this powerful story-telling with data to drive its point home. Avoid tearjerker videos designed to manipulate the watcher to simply open a wallet. Remember, the goal is to build relationships with your donors, not to get one-time donations. If you need help producing high quality videos, there are many companies who can help. Vizolution is a firm that can not only produce your content, but can assist outlining a digital strategy to ensure it's success.
CharityWater 2010 Campaign: Clean Water for the Bayaka
2. Acquire Fundraisers Not Donations
Focus on collecting fundraisers, not donations, which means your calls-to-action (CTAs) should be “Create a Fundraiser” or “Get Involved” vs. “Donate”. Aspire to create donors who are advocates and so connected to the impact of their fundraising campaigns, that they want to share them with their friends and family. They want to videotape their fundraisers and take pictures and share them on their social media platforms.
Every person is in essence running his or her own content marketing campaign. As an example, on average, every fundraising campaign that CharityWater brings in, nets 13 new donors.
3. Create an Experience for Your Donors
Focus on creating experiences for your donors throughout the course of your relationship so that they feel a personal connection to your brand. In addition to fundraising, they can send an eCard, donate their voice (where your cause sends out tweets in their feeds), create a Team that represents your non-profit and competes in running, biking or other competitions to raise money. Ideally, they can create web pages on your site so that others can see how much money they have raised, how many lives they have touched, how they've competed etc.
Make them a hero (see below). This gives people an intimate connection to their efforts. “Social proof” is particularly powerful when celebrities are setting the example. Create a birthday section of your website so that people can donate their birthdays (asking for donations instead of presents) and see who else has a birthday on the same day as you (especially celebrities). Inspire them and create a journey for your donors. The more positive the experience, the more involved they will be and emotionally connected they will feel to your brand and the cause.
4. Close the Loop
Employ numbers throughout your website so that people feel like they are aligned with thousands of others in helping your cause.
“We're solving the water crisis together with 59,643 fundraisers just like you. Join us and fundraise for clean water”
Show your donors where every dollar goes — close the loop and show your donor how their fundraising money was used. Send them a report, a video, or a slideshare — whatever is needed, so that they feel a part of the process and appreciated.
5. Make the Fundraiser the Hero
Make your fundraisers look great. Give them an amazing experience that they can brag about to their friends and family, who may soon become new fundraisers as well. The same principle applies to competition pages. If someone has created “Team Cindy” and is running in a marathon and raising money for your cause, we want the donors to see the pictures and donations as they come in.
6. Let Your Creative Talent Utilize Their Expertise
The Internet is exploding with content. If you want to produce high quality videos, hire a creative team and give them the space and the time needed to do their jobs. You don't need a large team — just a couple of people, with some decent equipment and you'll be good to go. Your content should be your highest priority and your energy and passion should drive this goal.
7. Focus on Great (but simple) Design — Create an “epic brand”
People don't often appreciate the value of beautiful simple design. If you are going to pursue a content strategy or unique brand, design is of the utmost importance. Establish clear brand guidelines for your company, a tone of voice and personality, so that you maintain consistency for all content produced. One of the best early hires you can make is a seasoned skilled graphic designer or design firm. Scott Harrison, founder of CharityWater, quotes Nick Christoph, “toothpaste is peddled with more sophistication than all of the world's life saving causes”. Scott thought CharityWater could change that and focused much of his efforts on creating an “epic brand” with outstanding design elements.
8. Identify an Evangelist for Your Brand
People relate to people. Choose one person to become the “face of your brand”. Ideally, if you can find a celebrity willing to not only lend his or her name, but get involved, all the better. Matt Damon was one of the co-founders of CharityWater in 2009. Once you have identified your brand evangelist, you can then create content using this name and the brand, sharing it on social networks, via the press etc. No celebrity? No problem. Just choose someone who has a good personal story to share and can be intimately involved in the cause and the work. Now, produce videos, blogs and images with this person, to tell the story and share, book speaking events and promote.
How can you apply this to your organization?
As always, the first step is deciding you want to pursue a new fundraising strategy, or at least agree that you want to build upon your existing donor relationships using storytelling and experiential strategies. From there, working with a digital content firm like Vizolution can help outline a strategy to get you started. Begin with a couple of inspirational videos to nurture your existing donor relationships and interest a new audience in your cause.

Obama could even put Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court at least temporarily, maddening the Republicans who denied him a hearing.
Barack Obama is probably not going to be in a terribly good mood between now and January 20, 2017, the day Donald Trump takes the oath of office to succeed him. Trump and his people, not to mention the Republican Members of Congress who have fought Obama tooth and nail for eight years, are champing at the bit to repeal his signature legislative policies, revoke his regulations, and replace his executive-branch appointees, cheering lustily with each shovelful of dirt thrown onto the 44th president's legacy.
Beyond the personal insults he will endure, and the pain involved in watching his accomplishments being spitefully unraveled, there's an issue of partisan justice that may be nagging at the president's conscience. From the day he took office (and actually long before then), Republicans have broken every imaginable unwritten rule about comity and civility and bipartisanship-in-the-national-interest. Last month, David Dayen briskly summed up the elephant's crimes against the donkey:
Republicans have absolutely no problem breaking any norm in their path to power. They turned the filibuster from a seldom-used tool to a routine exercise. Tom DeLay saw advantage in doing a second redistricting in Texas in 2003 to pick up extra GOP seats, even though states normally redistrict every 10 years; he succeeded. Congress typically passes the debt limit without comment, but Republicans took the country to the brink of its first default, extracting concessions in the process. A minority of the Senate prevented the confirmation for years of any director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau simply because they didn't like the agency. The opposition party would never attempt to conduct foreign policy that differed from the president's, until Republican senators tried it before the Iran deal.
And, of course, the year-long blockade of [Supreme Court nominee Merrick] Garland, who has not even received a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, violated a long-standing norm.
Yet the GOP paid no price for this deeply irresponsible course of action. Indeed, by so often thwarting Obama and making the federal government seem completely incompetent, they rewarded themselves, as the antigovernment party and as the party “out of power” (in the executive branch, anyway), with the political fruits of partisan gridlock and dysfunction. Yet now, Republicans expect Obama to play by the rules they so often disregarded and give way to the new regime gracefully.
If Obama is indeed in the mood for a final act of defiance toward these vandals, what can he do? Last-minute regulations (apart from some hard-to-reverse environmental actions that he has already taken like offshore drilling bans that are issued for fixed terms) aren't very fruitful; some can be simply revoked by Trump or his agency appointees, and others Congress can kill under the Congressional Review Act. Yes, he retains the power to pardon right up to the end, but that's not going to place a more permanent Obama stamp on the public sector.
That leaves one potentially big stick in Obama's rapidly shrinking arsenal: recess appointments of judges to fill scores of federal-bench vacancies — up to and including Antonin Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court.
But wait: Didn't the Supreme Court eliminate recess appointments in a recent decision? Not exactly. In a 2014 decision, SCOTUS unanimously ruled that recess appointments by the president (which only remain in force until the end of the ensuing congressional session) could be thwarted by Senate “pro forma” sessions that technically keep Congress in session perpetually. But the Senate does have to eventually end the session before beginning a new one on January 3, 2017. And a precedent was set by none other than Republican Theodore Roosevelt that a president could make “intercession” recess appointments in the seconds between one swing of the gavel and the other. TR made 193 recess appointments at the beginning of 1903, and while the legality of the action has been questioned, it has never been clearly overturned. If Obama were to follow this procedure, it would take extensive litigation to reverse it, and it might stand after all.
The pretext for judicial-recess appointments is clear enough: Even after Senate Democrats outlawed the filibuster for non–Supreme Court judicial (and executive-branch) nominations in 2013, once Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2015, they began slow-walking judicial confirmations. At present, there are 103 vacancies in the federal judiciary. When Obama took office there were only 54. He could make the argument that the federal courts have been hamstrung by these vacancies, and use recess appointments to fill some or all of them.
If he really chose to make an object lesson of the fruits of GOP obstructionism, Obama could wheel out the Big Bertha: a recess appointment of his Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, who has been outrageously denied even the courtesy of a confirmation hearing by Senate Republicans ever since his nomination in March. There is another Republican precedent for the recess appointments of a Supreme Court justice (under Eisenhower). Yes, Republicans could thwart it by belatedly taking up Garland's nomination and rejecting it (though, they could face a Democratic filibuster unless they choose to kill that option, too). But it would sure get everybody's attention in a way that could not help but cast blame back on those who obstructed Garland's confirmation in 2016. As Dayen puts it:
It goes without saying that Obama appointing Garland in this fashion would be highly controversial. Indeed, it would make the nation's collective head explode. Conservatives would demand the Court immediately block the appointment. However, it is likely they would need Garland to participate in a case that gets a ruling so they could have a plaintiff with standing to say they have been harmed by the Garland appointment. And then they would have to move that case through the lower courts. That process would take several months, and all the while the Supreme Court would have a center-left majority.
None of this is likely to happen, in part because Barack Obama isn't built that way, and in part because Democrats might fear the gesture would distract attention from the terrible things the new Trump administration and its congressional allies are trying to do to the country on many fronts. Trump's approval ratio is already terrible; why make him look like a victim of that Kenyan tyrant Obama and his secular-socialist Democratic Party?
But it would be soul-satisfying for Obama to upset his tormenters on the way out the door, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely before the new Congress is gaveled in.
“In reflecting on tonight, I was reflecting on a couple of questions that happened in this arena. How many times have we gathered in this arena to lead our Redbirds to victory? How many times have these walls echoed our cheers of joy over a long 3-pointer or vocal opinions on a referee's bad call? How many times have we high-fived the people standing next to us after a last-second win or shook our collective heads after a victory somehow slipped away?
For many of us, the answers can best be found in the hundreds to thousands of long hours and breathtaking seconds. Tonight we gather under completely different circumstances, but for the very same reasons to support our Redbirds and each other. We are a family and that is what families do. Indeed, that is what Redbirds do. We support each other.
During February's Founders Day Bell Ringing Ceremony, not long ago, I commented that this past year is like a microcosm of our history. We have celebrated times of unrivaled success and endured periods of overwhelming challenge. We have raised our fists in triumph and we have wept in sorrow. Tonight our heads are bowed as we mourn the untimely passing of two amazing Redbirds and of five local and loyal Redbird friends.
I have talked to so many people and received hundreds of emails and texts over the past 36 hours from Florida to California to New York and back. Most of those individuals knew one or all of the men who were on that plane. The comment I heard again and again was how each and every one of those individuals was truly a special person. Their deaths are a tragic loss to their families, to Illinois State University and our entire community. My wife, Marlene, is with us tonight. Our prayers and sympathies for the entire Illinois State community go out to the families.
For our athletics department, for our university and for our community, tonight is a night of grieving, but it is also a night of caring, sharing and a lot of hugs. It is also a night of resilience for a close Illinois State family.
While tomorrow may still dawn with some sadness, which at this point probably is not a choice. The day after tomorrow we will begin to be able to make some choices. We made a choice to be here tonight. We made a choice to support each other. We made a choice for many of us to become employees of this University to teach and provide support for this University. The students made a choice to enroll here and the players made a choice to play here. Tomorrow …. and the day after that …. and the day after that … and the day after that, we will be able to make some sense of other important choices.
I think that choice needs to be to honor the legacy of these young men who left us way too early. To honor their legacy and make a choice that we will charge on and be the best we know how to be as students, as staff, and as a community.
Tomorrow will also be a dawn of hope. Let's support each other in that hope and move onward and upward. May God bless all of you.”

Hialeah Mayor Carlos Hernandez was sued by the Miami-Dade Commission on Ethics and Public Trust after attempting to pay a $4,000 fine by using 28 buckets filled with 360,000 pennies and nickels. Photo by vetkit/Shutterstock
MIAMI, Nov. 19 (UPI) -- Hialeah Mayor Carlos Hernandez was sued by the Miami-Dade Commission on Ethics and Public Trust after attempting to pay a $4,000 fine entirely in coins.
In addition to the lawsuit, the commission also doubled Hernandez's fine on grounds that Hernandez intentionally broke the commission's regulations by paying his fine with 28 buckets filled with 360,000 pennies and nickels.
"On Nov. 6, the mayor sent 28 buckets of coins in an apparent attempt to pay the fine in disregard of the COE requirement that it be paid by check," the commission said. "His ploy was deemed commercially unreasonable and contemptuous by COE staff, and therefore, rejected."
In contrast to the commission's statement, Hernandez told Univision earlier in November that he was unaware of any county law that prohibited such payment.
Hernandez was quoted in the The Miami Herald when the payment was initially denied, challenging the commission to take legal action against him and stating that, whether check or coins, his payment was made in valid U.S. currency.
"If they wish [the commission] can go to court, but they will have to explain why a public organization does not accept this country's currency."
The original fine stemmed from an incident in which Hernandez lied about his collecting $180,000 of interest from a Ponzi schemer named Luis Felipe Perez.
The commission announced that a date had been set for Hernandez to appear in court in defense of his failure to comply with the payment of his fine.
Jim Gordon shines a light on the corrupt GCPD as Detective Comics explores Zero-Year!
The Good:
Writer John Layman shows us what young Lt. James Gordon was up to during the events of “Zero Year,” which you can read in the Batman book! This issue focuses on Gordon and his attempts to clean up the city. With the power completely knocked out in Gotham, criminals and violent gangs are taking over the city and stretching the police force thin. To make matters worse, Gordon isn't getting any help from his fellow officers as they intentionally slow down any investigations into serious crimes. Layman writes Gordon well: he's practical, logical, smart, and with a little bit of that dry wit and sarcasm we've come to expect from Gordon. He knows how to write Jim Gordon's personality well. It's a nice change of pace for Detective Comics to star Jim Gordon, and honestly, it was refreshing. With Batman appearing in several books, Detective Comics could be even better if it focused more on Jim Gordon's story in the future, similar to the “Black Mirror” storyline or even like the book Gotham Central from years ago. And if this single issue is any indication, John Layman is the man for the job. He shows us how Gordon sticks to his moral code and that he's not afraid to bend the rules a bit in order to do his job: protect Gotham. Gordon isn't some goody-goody boy scout—he's a flawed man trying to do his best in a city of corruption. And that's exactly why we love Jim Gordon.
Detective Comics #25 also had some nice surprises to add to Batman's mythology. Detective Harvey Bullock, looking much younger and so dapper, makes a cool cameo. We learn the idea behind the Bat-signal and how it came into use. And artist Jason Fabok pays homage to the first cover with Batman (way back in 1939's Detective Comics #27). Speaking of Fabok, that brings me to my next point. The man is amazing. His art keeps getting better and better. Fabok's art is crisp and clear while still retaining the dark, ominous atmosphere that perpetually hangs over Gotham. There is no one that draws Gotham quite like how he does. Jason Fabok is, for lack of a better word, bad-ass. The homage mentioned earlier is a beautiful splash page that makes readers pause, eyes wide, and unconsciously say out loud, “Wow.” It's great.
The Bad:
This issue isn't quite perfect though. For one, John Layman's story structure is getting very familiar. Detective Comics #25, like a few other issues before it, begins with some big action happening in the first two or three pages before jumping back in time and showing the reader what led to that moment. It's a neat way to hook people into a story right at the beginning, but only when used sparingly. If almost every issue begins the same way it starts to lose that hook and gets tiresome. Secondly, readers are introduced to Roman Sionis as Jim Gordon investigates the Black Mask gang. However, we never really learn what Sionis is doing or why he's doing these things. All we're told is that he's the CEO of a major cosmetic corporation and oh yeah he is also a crime boss for some reason. Why? Well hopefully those answers will be revealed in future issues of Detective Comics.
The third thing that stuck out to me about this issue involved Gordon falling off a bridge. (SPOILERS ahead so reader beware! I'll let you know when it's safe again.) After being thrown off a bridge by some unsavory policemen, Gordon not only survives the fall but walks away from it completely unharmed. He spends some time in the issue wondering how he managed to survive a fall that would normally kill someone, but he's never quite sure what happened. It's not until the end of the issue that Gordon realizes he had help from some Dark Knight out there. Here's my problem with this: wouldn't Gordon feel someone rescue him at the last second before he hit the water? He should have known right then and there that he had help, right? And when we first see Gordon survive that fall, we see him walk out of the water. If Batman saved him in time, why didn't Batman take Gordon to land? Did Batman briefly save Gordon from hitting the water, only to drop him back in it and make him swim to shore? (Okay, the SPOILERS are over now. Continue!)
The verdict: 4/5
Overall this is a great one-shot story starring James Gordon and it fits in nicely with Zero Year. John Layman's take on the future police commissioner and the corrupt GCPD was nicely done and it felt like a classic, old school, Jim Gordon storyline. Jason Fabok's art is top-notch as always and the splash pages are wonderful. There are some very minor issues that stuck out to me, but nothing serious enough to really take away from the story and overall book. It's a great, self-contained story and a treat for your eyeballs at that!
HANNOVER, Germany-- President Obama said Monday he believes the ongoing migrant and refugee crisis is not just a European problem, but a U.S. problem as well.
Speaking with "CBS This Morning" co-host Charlie Rose in Germany before meeting with European heads of state, the president also expressed concern about how the conversation surrounding the crisis is impacting European politics.
"What I've said to them is that this is not just a European problem. This is our problem too," Obama said.
President Obama explains why he's sending more troops into Syria
"But more importantly, more strategically, is the strain it's putting on Europe's politics, the way that it advances far-right nationalism, the degree to which it is encouraging a break up of European unity, that in some cases is being exploited by somebody like Mr. Putin."
Pressed by Rose on if he believes Russia's President Vladimir Putin is aiming to divide Europe, Obama said that Putin has not always been keen to the idea of European unity.
"Mr. Putin has generally viewed NATO, EU, trans-Atlantic unity, as a threat to Russian power," he said.
"Now, I think he's mistaken about that. I've indicated to him that, in fact, a strong, unified Europe working with a strong, outward-looking Russia -- that's the right recipe. So far, he has not been entirely persuaded."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's UKIP party, widely credited as having been a major factor behind the country's decision to leave the European Union, lost its only lawmaker on Saturday when Douglas Carswell announced he was leaving the party.

Carswell, 46, defected to UKIP from the Conservative party led by then Prime Minister David Cameron in August 2014 and went on to win a by-election in the eastern seaside town of Clacton that year.
“Like many of you, I switched to UKIP because I desperately wanted us to leave the EU,” he said in a statement. “Now we can be certain that that is going to happen, I have decided that I will be leaving UKIP.”
“I will leave UKIP amicably, cheerfully and in the knowledge that we won.”
He said he would remain as Member of Parliament (MP) for Clacton, as an independent, until the next general election due in 2020.
Carswell's announcement comes just four days before Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May formally triggers the EU divorce process, following last June's referendum vote to quit the bloc that Britain joined 44 years ago.
The party's best-known politician Nigel Farage held a long-running feud with Carswell over party policies and he had previously accused Carswell of trying to split the party.
The defection will raise questions within UKIP as the party hopes to capitalize on its successful campaign to leave the EU.
After months of turmoil following Farage's decision to step down as leader last June, it had finally elected its former chairman Paul Nuttall as leader in November and was aiming to increase its representation in the 650-seat parliament.
Nuttall failed however in his bid in February to win a by-election in Stoke, central England, which was one of the most solidly pro-Brexit areas on England in the referendum.
In a statement, Nuttall said: “Douglas was genuinely committed to Brexit but was never a comfortable Ukipper.”
“Our party has not benefited financially or organizationally from having Douglas in Westminster. His departure will make no difference to my ability or focus on delivering the reforms I promised when elected as leader.”
Story highlights A top Iranian general accuses Israel and the United States of "state terrorism"
Massoud Jazayeri warns of a "punitive response" after a nuclear scientist dies
Top U.S. officials say categorically their country was not behind the killing
An Israeli general says he doesn't know who did it, but "doesn't shed a tear"
Israel and the United States are "supporters of state terrorism" and will suffer a "punitive response" at an "opportune time," Iran's Press TV cited a top Iranian general as saying Sunday, days after an Iranian nuclear scientist was killed.
Iran will hold "the U.S., Britain and the Zionist regime accountable for their actions," said the deputy chairman of Iran's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Brig. Gen. Massoud Jazayeri.
Jazayeri said the assassination would not hinder Iran's progress towards strategic technologies, the government-run Press TV reported Sunday, following an interview with him on Saturday.
Nuclear scientist Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan was killed Wednesday by what Iran described as a magnetic bomb attached to his car.
He was the third Iranian nuclear scientist to be killed in the past two years. A fourth survived a similar assassination attempt.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton "categorically" denied any role in the attacks, but urged Iran to halt its quest for a nuclear bomb.
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta Thursday told troops in Texas: "We were not involved in any way -- in any way -- with regards to the assassination that took place there.... that's not what the United States does."
Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said on his Facebook page Wednesday: "I have no idea who targeted the Iranian scientist but I certainly don't shed a tear."
Iran's top cleric has blamed the CIA and Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, for killing the scientist, Press TV said earlier.
Roshan's death shows that "the global arrogance spearheaded by the U.S. and Zionism has reached a deadlock in confrontation with the determined, devout and progressive nation of Islamic Iran," Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by the state-run Press TV.
Those responsible will not own up, Khamenei said, but the attack "has been carried out by the planning or support of CIA and Mossad [spy] services, like all other crimes of the network of international state terrorism."
Khamenei ended his message of condolence with a warning: "We shall persist in punishing the perpetrators of this crime, as well those supporting them behind the scenes."
Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent his condolences Friday to the families of Roshan and his driver, who also died following the attack, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. He pointed the finger at "agents of imperialism and international Zionism," a reference to Israel.
Other Iranian officials also blamed the killings on Israel and the United States, both of which have accused Tehran of pursuing a nuclear bomb -- a claim it denies.
Meanwhile, a newspaper aligned with Khamenei called Thursday for the Islamic republic to respond in kind to the killings of its nuclear scientists, suggesting Israeli officials could be targeted.
The editor of Tehran daily Kayhan, considered the organ of Khamenei's supporters, questioned why Iran should not "exercise its legal right to retaliate."
Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, said the assassinations of scientists were intended to deprive Iranians of the right to peaceful nuclear energy.
"We believe that these terrorist attacks are supported by some elements -- especially within the Israeli regime as well as some quarters around the world," he said.
Iran says its nuclear program is aimed at producing civilian energy, not weapons. But it has rebuffed international demands to halt its enrichment of uranium, and the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has credible evidence that Iran has conducted weapons-related research.
The IAEA, which serves as the U.N. nuclear watchdog, reported in November that it can no longer verify that the Iranian nuclear program remains peaceful.
Pat Robertson began publicly criticizing the drug war in December 2010, and he has become more vocal since. Unlike the vague critiques often heard from prominent figures—even Barack Obama has called the drug war a failure—Robertson's insights have been precise, and consistent, and deeply-rooted. “We here in America make up 5 percent of the world's population, but we make up 25 percent of jailed prisoners,” he noted in March, appearing genuinely moved by the issue. “I really believe we should treat marijuana the way we treat … alcohol,” he told the New York Times. Beyond the practical argument, Robertson sees the moral dimension: “I believe in working with the hearts of people, and not locking them up.”
In light of his key role in the religious right, Robertson's comments take on special significance. The man speaks to a particular strain of social conservatives, not straying from their rhetorical comfort zone even as he champions drug legalization for principled reasons. He even blames the left for a burgeoning police state: “Every time the liberals pass a bill—I don't care what it involves—they stick criminal sanctions on it.”
Should “theocons” adopt a more tolerant view on drugs, it would shake the entire right-wing on the issue. They would be the last prominent faction to demonstrate skepticism. The American right has long had its share of drug-war critics. William F. Buckley articulately defended legalization on a half-hour PBS special in 1996. George Will has often explained the unintended consequences of prohibition, although he still falls short of calling for decriminalization. Barry Goldwater expressed skepticism toward the criminal-justice approach.
Neocons have either not cared much about drugs and other domestic matters or have sometimes embraced drug decriminalization as a nod to their social liberal side. Fusionist and libertarian-leaning conservatives have tended toward decriminalization. Right-wing talk radio, the information source for millions, has also featured many voices skeptical of drug laws, from the sensationalist Michael Savage to Jeffersonians like Mike Church. The common-sense center-right has often decried the futility of marijuana prohibition in particular.

Missing in the conservative approach to the issue has been an understanding of the grave threats prohibition poses to the social institutions that cultural conservatives, including the Christian right, hold dear. If Robertson foreshadows a coming shift in the Silent Majority's sentiments, this void will finally be filled. Despite the prominent critics among their ranks, everyday conservatives have consistently revealed themselves in polls as more hostile to decriminalization than liberals and moderates. A socially conservative turnaround on the issue would change everything. Just as many moralists who championed temperance turned against alcohol prohibition after seeing the social destruction it unleashed in the 1920s, today's social conservatives could play a defining role in ending drug prohibition.
The drug war embodies secular leviathan like few other government efforts. The federal anti-drug crusade began with Woodrow Wilson's signing of the Harrison Narcotics Act in 1914, escalated with Franklin Roosevelt's signing of the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937, and tyrannically expanded to cover previously legal psychedelics and other substances during Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Bill Clinton increased marijuana arrests and drug task force spending, greatly accelerating the Reagan-Bush drug war. Under Obama, the policies have once again enjoyed a boost: his 2009 stimulus bill included major hikes in drug enforcement spending that had dwindled under George W. Bush.
If alcohol prohibition qualified as the progressives' greatest domestic triumph in the early 20th century, drug prohibition has achieved even more as a usurpation of traditional morality and the social order. Constitutionalism, states' rights, subsidiarity, community norms, traditional medicine, family authority, and the role of the church have all been violently pushed aside to wage an impossibly ambitious national project to control people in the most intimate of ways. For years, the federal DARE program encouraged children to rat out their parents for minor drug offenses, an intrusion into family life all too reminiscent of Soviet Russia.
Prohibition-fueled gang warfare has not only inflicted violence upon the social fabric; the crime wave has also served as a rationale to weaken the very civil liberties that conservatives most cherish—particularly Second Amendment rights. Bloodshed on city streets attributed to the 1920s liquor trade spawned the National Firearms Act of 1934. Congress specifically targeted drug users in its Gun Control Act of 1968. The 1990 Crime Control Act focused on creating drug-free school zones, but semi-automatic rifles also came under its ambit. Even the 1993 Waco standoff, rationalized by the Clinton Justice Department as an anti-assault-weapons operation, started with search warrants dubiously directed at finding a meth lab. In the 1980s drugs had served as the excuse to carve out exceptions to the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act forbidding military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The radicalized grassroots patriots in the post-Cold War 1990s who saw national police power as a threat to their liberty, their guns, and their families should have recognized America's drug laws as a principal culprit.
Today drug money finances not just domestic gangs but foreign thugs as well. In the last decade many reporters have commented on how opium profits have enriched the Taliban—a nearly unavoidable result of America's drug policies, which keep narcotics highly profitable. But today the most conspicuous violent foreign threat comes from Mexico. The cartels, whose killing spree has taken tens of thousands of lives in just the last couple years, have shattered the peace on the border and become the subject of the Obama administration's most notorious scandal. Some conservatives have wondered aloud whether the “Fast and Furious” program of arming Mexican drug gangs was intended to create an excuse to crack down on American gun ownership. Regardless of the ATF's intentions, the drug violence has indeed served as a rationale to restrict American liberties, including the right to bear arms. But very little of this would be possible if these cartels could not fund themselves with the amplified profits that drug prohibition produces. (No wonder all of the conservative movement's heroes of economic science—Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman—were unambiguous in opposing the drug war, on practical as well as moral grounds.)
Recent polls indicate that a slight majority of Americans is now open to legalizing marijuana. Somewhat surprisingly, residents of liberal California are less likely than the nation at large to support the idea, according to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, although Democrats and voters in the lefty Bay Area favor decriminalization in far higher numbers than Republicans and the rest of the state. Conservatives are still the main ideological barrier to drug liberalization.
But the tide may be turning. At a Republican primary debate in South Carolina last May, Ron Paul likened the freedom to use drugs to the freedom to worship according to one's faith, a radical insight about the liberty of conscience usually heard mainly from proud proponents of psycho-pharmacological experimentation. Moderator Chris Wallace asked the Texas congressman whether using heroin was simply an “an exercise of liberty.” Paul responded with a rhetorical question: “How many people here would use heroin if it were legal?” He mocked the very idea of paternalistic prohibition: “Oh yeah, I need the government to take care of me. I don't want to use heroin, so I need these laws.”
The audience erupted in laughter and enthusiastic applause. Many of Paul's supporters sat in the crowd, but more important was the lack of booing from the more conventionally conservative attendees. In this Republican audience in a right-leaning state, some of the most radical arguments for heroin legalization fared surprisingly well. Even if today's conservatives do not buy into all the reasons to end prohibition, they no longer find them as dangerous or worthy of ridicule as in years past.
Also in May, a survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research found that 67 percent of Republicans wanted to see an end to federal medical-marijuana raids. President Obama's policies are not only out of touch with his liberal base, they are far more draconian than what most conservatives want. On the issue of national power, this is not a completely new development on the right. Citing states' rights, George W. Bush suggested he would put a stop to the raids in 1999. After becoming president, he stepped them up instead, but not nearly as much as Obama has done. According to Americans for Safe Access, the Obama Justice Department conducted 170 SWAT-style raids of medical-marijuana dispensaries between October 2009 and Spring 2012. Given his campaign promises to the contrary, Obama has “gone from first to worst,” according to Marijuana Policy Project Executive Director Rob Kampia. “There's no question that Obama is the worst president on medical marijuana.”
The federalism argument against the raids has always seemed more appealing to conservatives than liberals. In 2005, the Supreme Court upheld the marijuana raids in Gonzales v. Raich in the name of preserving an expansive federal commerce power. Antonin Scalia joined the majority, but Clarence Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor, and William Rehnquist dissented. Justice Thomas, the court's most conservative member, issued the most stirring rebuke, which he grounded in a restrictive reading of Commerce Clause power: “If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce), then Congress' Article I powers—as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause—have no meaningful limits.”
Tellingly, the Supreme Court's opinion upholding Obamacare this summer cited the precedents of Raich many times. Dissenting conservatives on the court attempted to find a distinction between the two rulings, but many commentators noted the corner into which Scalia in particular had painted himself, viewing federal power as nearly unlimited concerning medical marijuana but restrained on health insurance. Thomas was right in Raich that a federal police power that can supersede state marijuana laws, bust down someone's door, and jail him for growing a plant for personal use, faces no effective limits and is the very face of tyranny. The liberals who endorsed unmitigated federal power on Obamacare as well as on medical marijuana were being completely consistent. The logic of the drug war is the logic of the New Deal, national supremacy, and everything conservatives profess to hate about Obama-style governance.
Drug laws expose the tension within the conservative movement: devoted to localism and nationalism, freedom and law and order, today's conservatives, if they are to mount a meaningful resistance to the unrestrained bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., must choose between their conflicting values. Many on the Tea Party right have come to regard the Bush-created Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as clumsy and despotic. They cling proudly to their guns and religion. They worry about their privacy in the face of a relentlessly growing central state. But it was the drug war that first shredded the Bill of Rights in modern times.
Public opinion has gradually been turning against the militarized Just Say No approach. Meanwhile, special interests like the tobacco and law-enforcement lobbies continue to put pressure on politicians to maintain the status quo. Democrats do not have the political will or capital to push for major changes. Perhaps Republican leaders—unafraid of accusations of being soft on crime, emboldened by a conservative movement increasingly skeptical of unlimited police power—are the ones most likely to lead the charge toward liberalization. This prospect leaves much to be desired, but for the first time in many years perhaps there is some hope on the horizon, and from an unexpected direction.
A 26-year-old Finnish woman, Salla Koivu, has taken hanging out on Reddit to a whole new level of dedication. And in the process gained her Master's degree. Salla, a Helsinki native and a graduate from Aalto University School of Business decided the best way to complete her thesis on Why do people share online? was to hang out on Reddit for an entire year. Eager to find our more about this genius plan to legitimately mess around on the internet, we hooked up with her to find out what inspired her to go undercover and what she discovered about one of our all-time favourite websites.
Thanks for joining us, Salla. We're very jealous of your year “studying”. Our first question is out of the tons of online communities out there, why did you decide to focus on Reddit for your thesis?
To be honest, I didn't even consider other communities. For me, Reddit is the number one. I started redditing in I think 2008 or 2009 when my then-boyfriend showed me the site. Nowadays, I hang out there much more than he does. I couldn't help but to be fascinated by how Hitler jokes, cat gifs and political conversation all live side by side on the front page.
I know that for many, Reddit is just a pastime, but for me it's also a part of what made me who I am. I hung out on the site pretty much all my early adulthood, so Reddit actually molded my values and beliefs. I wouldn't be skeptical of even mundane things, I wouldn't have known not to take any ambien – Reddit even encouraged me to shift to open atheism. And imagine all the cute r/aww posts I would've missed!
Reddit is a very easy place to hang out on. What was your methodology and how easy was it to stay focused on it? How much time did you spend there daily?
My methodology was something called netnography. Netnography is basically a form of ethnography. Ethnography is a branch of anthropological research and it means studying people and culture by taking part of the said culture. One of my favorite ethnographies is actually on Harley-Davidson bikers. Netnography is like the nerdy and boring cousin of ethnography – instead of hanging out with African tribes in real life I hung out with Redditors online. I studied Reddit actively for a period of one year. The first half of that year I spent a few hours a day on Reddit. After that, I was more focused on writing.
Reddit has always been my go-to procrastination site: the place where I was when I was supposed to study. Now I was allowed to hang out on the site as much as I wanted to! I thought it would be really cool – what could possibly be an easier way to conduct a thesis? Well, surprisingly things didn't turn out to be so easy. As soon as Reddit became a chore, I somehow managed to stop enjoying the site altogether. Instead of browsing what I wanted, I was supposed to analyze my experience, save interesting content and not to get strayed to irrelevant pun threads – needless to say I did get strayed to irrelevant pun threads all the time.
To be honest, I was really happy when I was done with my thesis and could actually start to enjoy the site again.
What did you expect to discover and how did your conclusions differ?
I didn't expect things to get so deep. Reddit is mostly about entertainment: funny memes, cute videos and mildly interesting coincidences, you know the drill. Still, I found countless of people being irrationally angry: faking cancer for karma points – or getting some much-needed courage: for example for leaving an abusive relationship. I was touched and angered by posts more than my fair share as well. One of the most touching posts on Reddit is called, “Today you, tomorrow me” Please do read it, it's awesome!
What were the three most surprising things you discovered about Reddit?
1. Karma DOES matter
Karma's the number of upvotes minus downvotes your username on Reddit has. It's basically useless Internet points. You can't trade karma for anything, nobody else on Reddit is really not interested in your points, and nobody in your real life even knows you have them. Still, we are deeply social creatures and most of us crave for acceptance.
Many Redditors reported pondering endlessly on what they dare to post scared of critique and downvotes. And after posting, it is not uncommon to be super excited and scared of the reaction of others. And good forsake if you make a typo…
2. You are not alone
Do you think you are the only person to shave off their eyebrows while on Ambien? You are not. You think you are the only person who enjoys seeing photoshopped pictures of birds with human arms? You are not. You think you are the only baker who secretly sells cakes made of Pillsbury cake mix? Fear not, you're not alone.
Reddit is a community where truly anyone can find their niche!
3. Reddit can save your life – or at least make it better
For some Redditors, Reddit is truly a place for emotional relief, support and confessions on things they cannot tell to anyone else. r/atheism is a safe haven for many atheists in living in the Bible Belt, r/raisedbynarcissists is an awesome, albeit depressing, support group for people with abusive parents. r/loseit has encouraged countless Redditors to lose some weight.
For me, one of the most powerful reads was the thread “Throwaway time! What's your secret that could literally ruin your life if it came out?” The thread details dark and funny stories of secrets Redditors literally haven't shared with anyone. One of the most awesome stories is by a guy who allegedly secretly read a friend's diary to make her like him. That friend became his wife.
For some, this thread has actually offered significant support to get through rough times. For example, the ex-Police/Fire/911 Dispatcher /u/cuntrocket, with PTSD says on his post:
“For those of you asking how I am, or giving me encouragement via the PMs, a sincere “thank you”. There are days where I log into this account, see an orangered and use the wishes inside as my secret fuel to get through a tough day. ”
Finally, how has your opinion changed about Reddit, both for better and for worse?
I guess my thesis got me thinking Reddit as a more meaningful place – for better and for worse.
I know Reddit has its faults – it can be quite judgemental and circlejerky. And let's not forget that time we grasped the pitchforks in r/findthebostombomber and harassed the missing student Sunil Tripathi and his mourning family on completely false premises.
Still, for example r/suicidewatch can do a tremendous amount of good for people in rough situations. That's Reddit for you. It is as polarized and controversial as humanity is. It is capable of being completely horrible and unexpectedly awesome. For every touching cancer story, there's a person who fakes one. For every funny joke, there is a person who steals it.
I'm sure you'll agree Salla gives a fantastic insight into a fantastic online world. But maybe even more importantly, she also gives us a marvellous new excuse, called Reddit research, for messing around online. Needless to say, we've just pricked the surface of her overwhelming knowledge, so be sure to check out Ink Tank next week, when we'll be sharing her top ten favourite subreddits. Trust us when we say you'll never look at the Internet the same way again. In the meantime, if you have any questions for Salla, let us know down below.

Microsoft today announced that 125,000 organizations in 181 markets now use Teams, its Slack competitor for Office 365 subscribers. That's up from the 30,000 organizations in 145 markets that had adopted the service by the end of January.
In addition to this momentum update, the company also announced a number of feature updates to the service. Starting today, you can add anyone with an Azure Active Directory account as a guest to a team. Microsoft says there are currently 870 million Active Directory user accounts across its own commercial services and third-party Azure Active Directory apps. That still means there's a bit of a barrier to entry here for guest access and Microsoft plans to lower than barrier in the near future by also allowing Teams users to add anybody with a basic Microsoft Account to Teams.
Given that this is meant to be an enterprise tool, it doesn't come as a surprise that IT admins will be able to control guest access — and revoke it when necessary.
Also new in Teams is support for Botkit, one of the more popular bot-building tools, and new integrations with GitHub, as well as Atlassian's JIRA Service Desk, Core and Software, in addition to Bitbucket Cloud. That's an interesting move, given that Atlassian launched its own Slack and Teams competitor last week, but given that many enterprise developers use a mix of Atlassian and Microsoft tools, it makes sense for both companies to be present on each other's platforms.

Detroit (CBS Detroit) Google's mapping truck caught a disturbing image at what appears to be the same home where a 1-year-old girl was found dead inside a closet at her grandmother's house in July.
No one's been charged in that case.
But the same distinctive yellow brick house with the green porch is featured in a Google Maps image of a Detroit neighborhood.
Only in the Google image, time-stamped September 2009, a group of young men stand ominously on the porch, one clutching what appears to be a shotgun. One of the men appears to point the gun at the Google truck in the final shot. See the images on Google Street View.
[Photo Gallery]
Maryland meteorologist Jacob Wycoff, who was recently in Detroit on a business trip, spotted the Google Maps image, and said he could hardly believe it.
“I was actually just there in July,” Wycoff said. “It's certainly uneasy to see that type of stuff, I guess it happens in any major city, but Detroit sort of has a reputation now … That he actually points the gun at him?”
If the gunman was ever identified, is this a crime? Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said not necessarily.
Worthy said a lot of questions would need to be answered.”Was it this person's home? Because you do have a right to bear arms in your home. Certainly it looks like he's on a porch that's attached to a home, so that would not be a legal issue. Is this person an adult or a juvenile?”
Worthy said, in certain circumstances, even pointing a gun at someone is not illegal, if you feel threatened.
Google has a distinctively decorated mapping truck heading through metro Detroit with a camera mounted on top to perfect its satellite maps, with the goal of creating a 3-D map of every place in the world.
In this case, the truck was at Brinker and Robinwood in Detroit when the camera captured the young people with the weapon. The gun holder appears to follow the driver with the weapon — and points it at the truck in the final shot.
The home is identical to the place where baby Zyia Turner was discovered dead in a closet, with her cause of death undetermined. At the time, her father said his brother was watching several children Friday at the home near 7 Mile Road and Conant when she went missing. Police cadaver dogs later found her body buried under a pile of clothes in the closet.
There have been no arrests in connection with Zyia's death. Police said family members have been cooperative.
But will this image available to anyone trying to plot out a route in Detroit put another black eye on the city?
Worthy said the image just “adds another layer” to the poor opinion many already have.
Marc Hoffman wrote on Facebook, “If I was the driver, I would refuse to drive down any of those streets.”
Merry Campbell hopes Google re-shoots the image for the sake of the city. “It's a shame the image is being shown,” she wrote on Facebook. “It gives a terrible impression of the city, which already has a bad reputation, as it is. I hope that whoever is in charge at Google Maps will reshoot it!”
Not even a year ago I would throw my huge 12Ah 16lb LifePo4 Prismatic battery in my backpack and head out to ride in the woods for an hour or two. Although I had experimented with the ultra-light Hobby King Lipo's they simply had too many downsides to feel safe strapping one on my back to go riding in the woods. Over the last few years, the 18650 cells have improved dramatically to the point where, in my opinion, it is really the only kind of packs you would want to consider for an ebike.
Many months ago I was lamenting to Eric from Lunacycle about how he should build a small ‘spare tank' battery for ebikes. This battery would have around 5Ah of range or so and would be small enough to keep in your pocket for when your main pack died. This project was already well underway in the Lunacycle skunkworks and after many months of testing the packs are finally here. These packs are currently sold in three different configurations.
52v 6Ah 30Q pack that will do 30 Amps Cont and sells for $299 here
52v 7Ah GA pack that will do 20 Amps Cont and sells for $314 here
52v 6Ah PF pack that will do 20 Amps Cont and sells for $229 here
Although the BMS for these Mighty Mini Cubes is capable of putting out 30Amps Cont, I list what I would recommend running these packs at, as the cells are not really capable of putting out more than that amount of power for anything more than a short period of time without getting much hotter than I think they should get.
I have to say it's an amazing feeling to just throw one of these batteries in your backpack and go for a ride without even being able to feel the weight of the battery at all. I tested the 30Q pack pretty extensively on singletrack and I have to say that this pack surpassed my every expectation. Before these Mighty Mini 2P packs came out your only option for using a 2P pack was to rewire a power tool battery pack or make your own out of higher power cells like the 25R. The new 18650 cells for 2016 can provide BOTH high power AND high-capacity allowing these new 2P packs to arrive and impress us all with their power capacity and peak output ability.
I bought one of these batteries as soon as it hit the market and anxiously waited for it to arrive. The shipping cost was only $30 (most of the bigger batteries have a fixed shipping cost of $40) and when it arrived I charged it to full capacity using my 52v Lunagizer charger which is the only charger I recommend other than the Cycle Satiator. I decided that I would see how long it lasted with a BBS02 using PAS only at power level 2. For my first ride after about 40 minutes the battery still seemed to have plenty of juice in it and it wasn't even warm yet so I laid on the throttle. After about 10 more minutes of riding at full throttle, the battery had gotten warm, but the Mighty Mini cube still had a charge and was still putting out plenty of power. This is one of my favorite parts of using 52v 14S batteries on drive systems like the BBS02 and BBSHD which were designed for only 48v systems. The 52v systems run the drive unit at nearly full power even when they are close to dying. With a 48v 13S pack once it gets near the end of its charge the battery starts feeling really anemic.
I tested the Mighty Mini in my pocket, but it was pretty uncomfortable, it felt like I was carrying around a small brick. The best setup I found for this battery was dangling from under the seat using a Saddle Bag Scrotal Sack. The battery fit nicely and since it was dangling down it didn't hit against the bottom of the seat or seat tube. As an added bonus this is one of the stealthiest places to store your battery as no one is going to look under your ass when they ride by you, nor are they going to suspect that your battery is so tiny that it will fit in a saddle bag sack.
One of the biggest barriers for people getting into the ebike market is the cost of the battery system. When I'm commuting on the road with a BBS02 and a 52v battery I get about 1.5 miles per amp hour at the highest level of pedal assist with a 52T front ring. This means that most people can average about 25mph on their ebike and with the PF pack should be able to go over 10 miles per charge with a $229 battery that weighs in at only 3.3 lbs. What we are seeing here is nothing short of revolutionary as the price\weight\performance characteristics of ebikes are now breaking into what normal consumers (not just enthusiasts) are willing to accept. While I didn't think much about strapping a 16lb battery to my back to go riding in the woods for an hour or two, most normal people would think I am totally insane. Let's face it, backpack batteries suck.
A note about power and heat. I have found that when I run the BBS02 with PAS at power level 9 it hovers between 15 and 20Amps of power. If you have a BBS02 and want to use the throttle then the only 2P pack you should even consider getting is the 30Q. If you are happy using PAS only then the GA or PF packs should be fine. If you have a BBSHD then the only pack that I recommend you consider getting is the 30Q pack, as the GA and PF packs will overheat if you run the BBSHD at the higher power levels or lean on the throttle. Although I really like the GA cells (52v GA Shark pack review is coming soon) they do tend to get pretty hot at high-current draw, at least hot enough so that it makes me pretty nervous. If your hub motored ebike has a controller that is between 20 and 30Amps then I would go for a 30Q pack only. If your controller is 20 Amps or fewer than the GA or the PF packs will both work well, just pick the most expensive pack that you can't afford. That is what other people's credit cards are for.
Remember that most but not all 48v ebike controllers can run with 52v packs. The best way to test to see if yours will work is to plug someone elses 52v battery fresh off the charger to your controller and see if it works of if there is a high voltage cutoff. If there is no high voltage cutoff then it will probably work, although it will certainly void any warranty you have and you could fry your controller. You only live once.
If you're looking for an ultralight battery pack for single-track riding in the woods, banging around town in, or as a spare tank of juice for when your main battery dies, then look no further than the Luna Mighty Mini 3.3lb 52v 14S2P Cube. There is nothing else like it on the market and I can say that this pack delivers on all the promises that it makes for weight, performance, and fun.
Ride On.
Lyoto Machida is looking for a solid next opponent after going five rounds with UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman.
Former Strikeforce middleweight champ Luke Rockhold has been angling for a consequential next bout for quite some time.
Sounds Machida vs. Rockhold is a match that makes itself.
Daniel Cormier, a teammate of Rockhold at San Jose's American Kickboxing Academy, reported on Wednesday's edition of UFC Tonight that discussions are under way for a bout between the two.
Machida (21-5), the former UFC light heavyweight champion, is 2-1 since dropping down to 185 pounds. At UFC 175, he put on a breathtaking performance over the final two rounds of his challenge of Weidman, throwing everything but the kitchen sink at him after losing the first three rounds. Weidman won the fight via unanimous decision.
Rockhold (12-2), meanwhile, was last seen submitting Tim Boetsch at UFC 172 in April. While Rockhold has openly campaigned for a rematch against Vitor Belfort, who defeated him via knockout in 2013, Belfort is instead slated to challenge Weidman for the title in December.
There is no date targeted yet for the fight. But Cormier suggested a pair of logical candidates: The main event on the UFC on FOX card in Phoenix on Dec. 13; or the main card on Dec. 6 in Las Vegas underneath Weidman and Belfort.
