Story highlights Scott Jennings: Trump appears to have brought on Papadopoulos with little vetting to show they had a foreign policy team
They say stupidity brought Papadopoulos, now a problem, into Trump's orbit. They were a hanger-on of a type familiar to people experienced with campaigns

(CNN) Much is being made of Donald Trump, back when they were a Republican presidential candidate under pressure to show that they had a foreign policy team, referring to George Papadopoulos as "an oil and energy consultant, excellent guy," according to a recording produced by The Washington Post.

What has not been reported much from that recording -- which was made during an interview Trump had with the Post's editorial board -- was what Trump said just before they uttered the guy's name:
"Do you have that list, so I'll be a little more accurate with it?" Trump asks an aide, responding to a question about their foreign policy advisers.
We don't know how much Trump actually knew about who was on the list, but they begin reading notes from a piece of paper. One suspects, from their delivery, that if Jason Voorhees had been listed, Trump would have read their name and said: "Hockey player. Excellent guy."
That recording was taken on March 21, 2016. On March 31, Trump's campaign released a picture of the candidate meeting with their foreign policy team, and Papadopoulos is shown at the table. At this event, according to The New York Times, Papadopoulos "pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and (Russian President) Mr. Putin," but then-Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, "as the campaign's top national security official, spoke vehemently against the idea, asking others not to discuss it again. Mr. Trump did not challenge him."

Analysis of yesterday's news coverage of the Mexican massacre
Mexican Tweets
More than fifty people were murdered yesterday in what is now the most violent episode in the ongoing Mexican Drug War. Most of the victims were women, some were pregnant. After learning about the horrific massacre in Monterrey, I spent several hours reading the reports coming from México via social and mainstream media. I exchanged messages with friends and family who live there (I went to college in Monterrey and my parents live no too far from there). The Twitter trending topics in México showed anger, desperation and hopelessness. One of the hashtags people often used to report violence in the city, #mtyfollow, was full of messages of repudiation and of people trying to help others find their loved ones. Some of the most retweeted messages were those with the names of the possible victims, as you can see in this chart.
American Silence
The massacre happened only 140 miles south of Texas in one of the largest metropolitan areas in North America. Yet, as Nancy Baym put it, the American twittersphere was mum. Why? In part, I think, because most of the news websites in the US were ignoring the event.
One could understand the lack of coverage in the first few hours. The news coming out of México were talking about “only” four deaths, so it is possible the events might not have caught the attention of the American news websites at first. However, ten hours after the attack the official number was already above fifty victims, with some reports as high as 61, yet sites like CNN.com gave little attention to the story. The link to the article of the massacre was buried among articles such as one about actor Rose McGowan's childhood.
I know CNN is not known for its high-quality news coverage so I decided to check out one of America's most trusted news outlets: the New York Times. I was disappointed, again. I had to scroll all the way down to the “More News” section to find a 10 pixel-font link to the article titled “Arson Kills 40 in a Casino in Mexico.”
Pixels per Victim
Frustrated by this, I decided to get a more objective assessment of the coverage by counting the number of pixels different news websites were assigning to the story of the massacre. I know web designers put a lot of work into every single pixel on the screen, especially of high-traffic websites. Visitor's attention is scarce and every pixel counts. So I took screenshots of the front pages of some of the major news websites and calculated the amount of screen real state assigned to the story of the massacre. For example, the the New York Times, gave the story 291×11 pixels, a mere 0.27% of the screen real state (in a window size of 1439 x812 pixels). CNN gave it even less at 191×10 pixels, representing 0.16% of the screen. But what about other websites? Did any other websites in the English-world gave it more space? Yes. Read on.
I decided to look into non-American websites. If my calculations are correct, it turns out that Al-Jazeera and The Guardian alone gave more pixels to the story than CNN, the Washington Post, FOX News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, MSNBC and the Houston Chronicle combined. Americans might be better off getting news about their southern neighbor from a British or a Qatari website than from many of the US ones. The two exceptions were the LA Times and the Huffington Post. They both gave more pixels to the story than any other news source I analyzed. CNN was at the bottom of the list though. Click here for a slideshow of the websites I analyzed.
To summarize my results, I generated a ranking of the number of pixels per victim each news website devoted to the massacre. Yes, this issue is much more nuanced than pixels per victim, and I am not a journalism expert but I hope it can help start a discussion (or continue an existing one). If my calculations are correct, CNN devoted 38 pixels per victim, 76 times less than the LA Times which gave 2,920 pixels per victim.
Closing Thoughts
The Mexican Drug War is a complex geopolitical conflict closely linked to the United States' financial stability and national security. If American news websites do not give enough attention to the massacre of 50 people, what can we expect of less dramatic stories with perhaps more structural and long-term implications? I list here some of the recent related stories that I wish had gotten much more attention and that I hope you get to read to understand the complexity of the problem:

Inspector-General accepts apology for leak of report
Inspector-General accepts apology for leak of report
The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Cheryl Gwyn, has accepted an unreserved apology from Hon Phil Goff MP for disclosing some of the contents of their recent Report into the Release of Information by the NZSIS in July and August 2011 to media prior to its publication.
The Inspector-General will not take the matter any further.
All witnesses, including Mr Goff, were subject to a confidentiality order of the Inspector-General. The order was made to ensure fairness and the integrity of the inquiry. The disclosure of the report by Mr Goff was in breach of the order.
While no classified information was disclosed, Mr Goff's disclosure led to premature media reporting on the content of the report, to the detriment of other witnesses to the inquiry, particularly those adversely affected by the report. Ms Gwyn said this was unfair to those witnesses, and they would be taking steps to ensure there was greater clarity around release protocols and legal obligations for future reports.
“I have met with Mr Goff and received a full and unreserved apology, in person and in writing. I have accepted that apology, and do not intend to take this matter further.”
Ms Gwyn would also be writing to media organisations that published details of the report to remind them of obligations under the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act.
“The Inspector-General has significant powers to inquire into sensitive matters, and make adverse findings which may have a material impact on individuals. The obligations around confidentiality are necessary to ensure natural justice and fairness. It is important these obligations are respected.”

BBQ Tips
How to keep BBQ hot if you're not quite ready to eat it...
use an ice chest/ice cooler. Put some hot water in an empty ice chest, close the lid and let it set for 3 or 4 minutes. Drain the hot water and you've got yourself a portable BBQ warmer. We've kept pork butts warm this way for 6 or 7 hours.
How to keep your hands clean when cooking BBQ...
use powder free latex gloves. They come in packs of 100 at the local Sam's and will keep your hands clean. You'll maintain good sanitary practices too.
How to keep your spouse interested in the BBQ hobby...
get him/her involved in it with you. It's a lot of fun. You meet nice people and it's something you can do together.
How to keep your BBQ expenses in line with your budget...
Research all your purchases thoroughly. Make sure your purchase will do what you want it to do BEFORE you purchase it. For example, if you want to learn to cook whole hogs, you probably need to consider a big cooker or if you want to cook 10-15 racks spare ribs every weekend you're going to need something bigger than a WSM.
How to continually improve your BBQ recipes...
keep records of your cooking efforts including cook times, prepping techniques used and especially measurements for sauces or rubs and spices used. When you tweak the recipe for taste, only change one thing at a time--change the cook time, change the rub, change the sauce, but try to avoid completely changing everything all at once. Small changes to your technique and recipes will help you focus on the effects better and you'll be able to fine tune the product quality more efficiently.
Et tu, Tony? In the past, this column has opened with a trigger warning that it is about to advance arguments favourable to former prime minister Blair. This week, you can relax (mostly).
The Tory fallacy: that migrants are taking British jobs and driving down wages | Vince Cable Read more
In its first major policy paper, Blair's Institute for Global Change has proposed what in the heyday of New Labour spin would have been called a “crackdown” on EU immigration. The suite of suggestions includes mandatory registration for entrants; new restrictions upon EU nationals' access to welfare, bank accounts and property rental; limitations upon migrants' access to the NHS if they are economically inactive; and an emergency brake on new arrivals when public services buckle under the strain.
Blair's logic is that Brexit can be averted only if its opponents address “the grievances which gave rise to it”. It may be no coincidence that their former policy chief, Lord Adonis, argued in the Observer that Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron might be willing to “make an offer, probably over the heads of the British government, for the UK to stay in the economic institutions of the EU but with national control over immigration”.
Such an outcome would be a big surprise to David Cameron, who was handed their hat when they asked for considerably less from Brussels before the referendum. But – retreat now to safe space if necessary – I do not question Blair's (or Adonis's) motives.
They believe, rightly I think, that Brexit will be bad for Britain and wants to use their public prominence as a three-time general election winner to steer the ship away from the iceberg that the passengers have chosen for their destination.
But this is not the way to go about it. In the first place, the arguments against immigration are economically illiterate. On today's Andrew Marr Show, for instance, Blair suggested that immigration had undercut wages and that measures of the sort they are advocating would address this injustice.
In fact, the discernible impact that population mobility has had upon pay is negligible, and is dwarfed by the effects of the long recession, austerity, technological transformation and the inclination of many workers to postpone their retirement or work longer hours (thus increasing the labour supply). Making life harder for EU migrants is not going to lead to a pay bonanza for UK-born workers, and any insinuation to the contrary is irresponsible.
The Home Office itself has conceded that there is “little evidence” that immigration has caused “significant displacement of UK natives from the labour market”. In 2014, a study by University College London found that entrants to the UK from the 10 nations that joined the EU in 2004 had contributed £4.96bn more in tax by 2011 than they had cost as beneficiaries of public services. Since the Guardian leaked Theresa May's plan to cut EU migration, employers have warned of the potentially dire consequences for the British economy.
In the second place, Blair contradicts himself. There is already predictable outrage that they have shifted position since 2004 when, as PM, they chose not to impose transitional controls on migrants from the 10 new EU member states. But the greater shame is that the most eloquent champion of “open” versus “closed” politics has yielded ground to their populist opponents now that they are in the ascendant.
As they put it in a New Statesman interview last November, those politicians who seek to pull up the bridge, build walls and isolate their nations gravely exaggerate the power of government. “My view about globalisation,” they said then, “is that it's a force essentially driven by people, by technological change, by the way the world has opened up. You're not going to reverse that.” Spot on.
So what are they up to? Some would call it triangulation: conceding just enough ground to the Brexiteers to neutralise their arguments, and to show the voters that their anxieties could yet be met without the UK leaving the EU.
‘British jobs for British workers' is back, a fascist incursion into mainstream politics | Rachel Shabi Read more
Marketers call this the quest for “permission”. The former PM seeks an audience with the electorate on Brexit generally by confounding their expectations on a hot-button issue. Gâteau de Blair: the cake you can eat and keep!
I am not among those who dismiss their new institute, or scorn their ambition to energise the lamentably dormant political centre.  They are right to acknowledge anxieties laid bare by the EU referendum and Donald Trump's victory.
But there is a big difference between acknowledgement and appeasement. That difference is, in practice, what separates grownup politics from shrill populism, effective government from sloganeering. Last year's Brexit debate was woefully infantilised, a shouting match won by lies about spending on the NHS and the harm caused by immigration. The leave campaign spoke grandly of “taking back control”, even as it surfed to victory on a tide of xenophobia, bogus nostalgia and pettiness.
It was all meant to be so simple. Yet look at the government as it struggles to steer the EU withdrawal bill through its second reading. This is but a taste of parliamentary battles to come as the rhetoric of last year melts and the complexity of the real world reasserts itself.
“There are answers to the anger,” Blair told Marr. One must hope so. But they will flow from statesmanship not short-term propitiation. A public figure such as Blair, no longer seeking votes, can afford to speak unpalatable truths and demand maturity of the public. It costs them nothing to disagree with the referendum outcome, to point out the perils of that decision and to urge the voters to think again. They can heed their grievances without endorsing the path upon which the nation has embarked.
Indeed, how much better it would have been if their institute's first intervention had been to declare emphatically that immigration was not the cause of those grievances; that the discontents of globalisation will not be addressed by token measures to keep out foreigners; that the true challenges of the 21st century are new forms of inequality, the venom of extremism, the disruptive power of automation and digital technology, and the pressing need for a new pluralism that redefines our common core of citizenship in a world of hectic change.
By declared intent, Blair's new mission is strategic. Good: let us hope for better things in the months to come. For this was a purely tactical start to the project, and not a distinguished one. It was, to coin a phrase, no more than an eye-catching initiative.

DRM screws blind people
Any digital text can be read aloud through text-to-speech, granting people with visual impairments the basic human right to read -- unless there's DRM in the way.
Tricking the technology used by Amazon, Apple, Adobe and Google to stop blind people from adding text-to-speech to their devices isn't hard -- but it is a felony, thanks to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. A UN treaty intended to help people with visual, cognitive and sensory disabilities access copyrighted works has been all but killed by the big publishers.
Groups representing blind people have asked the US Copyright Office to renew the very narrow exemption that allows legally blind people to jailbreak their devices to add text-to-speech, but no one knows if they'll get it. And even if they do, it remains a felony to make or supply the tools that allow blind people to undertake this feat.
Advocates narrowly procured the exemption for ebook DRM over the objection of the register of copyright when they applied in 2010. This year, it's anyone's guess—and that's part of the problem. Copyright law is taking away our rights. It means that developers are afraid of writing applications to help the blind. It means that consumers are afraid of repairing and tinkering with their things. And it means people with visual impairments, like Chris, don't know if they'll be able to keep listening to some of their books. “For me, if I could describe Text-to-Speech in one word, it would be liberating,” said Chris, now 16 and a junior in high school. “It's a kind of freedom. I, as a blind person, don't have access always to most kinds of information that sighted people have access to. It's a kind of freedom when I know that I have access to that information.” Reading is a basic human right, and no one—not the Library of Congress and not corporate copyright lobbyists—should have the power to take that away.

Because science is totally insane and doesn't care what you think, they've decided to go ahead and start restoring sight in blind patients. And because science is really ridiculous, they're doing it by implanting teeth into eye sockets. Yep, that's what you do when you're just that crazy-awesome.
Ian Tibbetts was 27 when a piece of scrap metal hit them in the face, eventually leading to loss of vision in their left eye, and the loss of their right eye altogether. Now 43, Tibbetts had tragically never seen the faces of their 4-year-old twin boys.
One scientist – Brighton's Christopher Liu, who is the only scientist that performs this procedure – was like, “Naw man, that's not cool; we want to give you your vision back.” So, in December of 2012, Tibbetts underwent groundbreaking surgery called “Osteo-Odonto-Keratoprosthesis,” which constructs a new eye using a plastic lens and one of Tibbetts's own teeth. They drill a tiny hole into the tooth, insert the lens into the hole, and then insert the whole tooth into the eye socket. If the retina is still functioning, the patient can see through the tooth-lens window – and the body will never reject it, since the tooth belonged to the patient in the first place. Hard core.
“I had a picture in my head of what [my kids] looked like,” said Tibbetts, “but they were better.” Cue massive, world-wide “awww.”
You'll be able to catch more of Tibbetts's story in an upcoming BBC One documentary called The Day I Got My Sight Back, because this guy has a tooth for an eye, and why wouldn't you want to watch that?
I've long been a vocal supporter of law enforcement. Anyone curious about my credentials in this area need only Google my name and "police" to see how often I've defended them and how often I've been lambasted by the Left for doing so.
But my support for a group of flawed mortal beings must always come with qualifications. "Supporting" cops must not mean defending them in every situation no matter what. I support them, I don't bow before them. I give them leeway, I don't give them carte blanche. There are limits.
This case exceeds those limits. Philip Brailsford, a former Mesa, Arizona, police officer, was somehow acquitted this week of murder and manslaughter in the shooting to death of a drunk, unarmed man. Unlike more high profile cases of alleged police brutality, this incident was caught — clearly, in its entirety, from start to finish — on camera. I'll tell you what the footage shows, but here's the link to the video in case you don't want to take my word for it. Warning: the footage is very disturbing. Proceed with caution.
Brailsford was called to a hotel in Mesa back in January of 2016 on reports that someone had been pointing a rifle out of a window. Daniel Shaver, very drunk at the time, had apparently been messing around with a few pellet guns that they used in their pest control job. Exceedingly stupid behavior on their part, but not deserving of the death penalty. Still, Brailsford and the other responding officers could not have known that they were pellet guns, so it's understandable that they were on edge.
But this is where it gets not-so-understandable. Shaver emerges stumbling out of their hotel room. He's told to get on the ground, and they immediately complies. Shaver attempts to follow every instruction shouted at him, but they have difficulty because the instructions make no sense. Here's a verbatim transcript of everything Brailsford told Shaver to do, as they pointed their rifle at them and threatened repeatedly to kill him: "lie on the ground," "put both hands on top of your head and interlace your fingers," "take your feet and cross your left foot over your right foot," "keep your feet crossed," "put both hands flat in front of you" (while they're on their head and interlaced?), "push yourself to a kneeling position" (have you ever tried to push yourself up while your arms are extended all the way in front of you?), "put both hands in the air," "crawl towards me" (with their hands in the air?), "stop," "crawl," "keep your legs crossed" (while crawling?), "put your hands in the air," "keep your legs crossed," "crawl" (so he's supposed to crawl again with their hands in the air and their legs crossed). In the midst of this flurry of hysterical, arbitrary commands, as Brailsford continually reminds Shaver that he'll die if they "makes a mistake," Shaver cries and begs for their life.
Then comes the fatal moment. As Shaver crawls, awkwardly and wobbly, trying to keep up with this deadly game of Simon Says, their pants begin to fall down. They reach to pull them up and Brailsford immediately sprays them with bullets. Shaver followed their ridiculous instructions for five minutes and still wound up dead.
Of course, Brailsford's defense was that Shaver reached for their waistband. Fine. But what was they worried about? That Shaver would pull a rifle from their basketball shorts? And even if they did have a gun, how was they going to pull it out and get off a shot from the crawling position? And what had Shaver done during this interaction to at all suggest that they were a threat? They were emphatically attempting to comply with every command. And why didn't Brailsford just walk over, while the man was laying prostrate on the ground, and cuff him? The officers on the scene had ample opportunity to detain Shaver without firing a shot. Instead they chose to have them dance around like a trained monkey. And the monkey died because they didn't want to dance with their shorts around their ankles.
By the way, anyone who would think of defending the cops here, try this: lie on the ground, interlace your fingers, put your hands out in front of you, cross your legs, and crawl with your hands in the air. Now imagine attempting this same act of contortion with police officers pointing rifles at you and a guy shouting that he'll kill you if you mess up. Now imagine all of that, but you've had a few beers. Do you think you would have gotten out of this alive?
So, was Brailsford acting like a law enforcement officer concerned with serving and protecting, or was they behaving like a jumpy, angry, incompetent, scared little bully on a power trip? I would say the latter, and a man is dead because of it. In fact, the Mesa Police Department seems to agree that Brailsford was bad at their job. They fired them several months ago for "unsatisfactory performance." Part of their unsatisfactory performance is the fact that they scrawled the phrase "you're f*cked" on the dust cover of their service rifle. The jury was not allowed to see that piece of evidence, but it does seem to give us a bit of a window into Brailsford's mindset. When they point their rifle at you, they say you're f*cked. They aren't lying. Nobody can accuse them of bluffing on that score. However we can accuse them of murdering an innocent man. And I will still make that accusation, no matter what the jury decided. The video, and common sense, speaks for itself.
Yet somehow this case has gotten very little attention from the national media. This is easily the most clear-cut and blatant example of honest-to-God police brutality that we've seen in years, and it's all on film, yet I only found out about it because someone I follow-on Twitter happened to mention it. Apparently a few prominent BLM folks have spoken out about this case, to their credit, but it certainly has not prompted mass protests and national attention. We have seen cases far murkier than this one plastered all over the front pages, while Shaver's death is treated like a minor story for the local press to handle.
Why?
Well, the answer seems obvious: Shaver was white. Had Shaver been a different shade, there would be riots in Phoenix and round-the-clock coverage on CNN. "Daniel Shaver" would be a name as famous and ubiquitous as Michael Brown and Freddie Gray. But that's not how things have worked, because the media isn't interested in exposing police misconduct generally. They're interested in exposing racially motivated police misconduct, even if they have to fabricate it out of thin air.
That's really a shame, because there are some police officers (not the majority, but some) who have no business wearing a badge. They enjoy lording their power over helpless, subservient civilians, and they relish the opportunity to use force. It would be good if the media was serious about exposing these cases when they happen, keeping the Powers That Be honest and holding them accountable for their behavior. A civilian shouldn't have to die because a cop was unsuited for the job. This isn't just an "oops, we'll do better next time" thing. Human life is sacred, and when it is taken wrongly, justice must be done.
Sadly, very few people are interested in justice. Many people on the one side are interested in advancing their racial narrative, while many on the other seem determined to paint police officers as selfless heroes in every situation, no matter how they actually conduct themselves. Justice, as usual, is lost in the fray. And so is Daniel Shaver.
T they issue of ethics and transparency in governance is a subject which has attracted a great deal of attention in the recent days.
There is a growing feeling among people that our laws, systems and procedures are not effective in dealing with corruption.
We must recognise that there is little public tolerance now for the prevailing state of affairs. Corruption is a challenge that we must tackle boldly and the Congress stands committed in doing so.
The Congress party has always been sensitive to the issue of corruption and has worked hard in fighting against the evil.
The investigating agencies are looking into many high-profile cases of corruption, which have attracted a great deal of public attention. The handling of these cases constitutes a litmus test.

A Texas judge has signed an order that voids the marriage of a transgender widow whose firefighter husband died battling a blaze.
The order prevents Nikki Araguz from receiving the death benefits of their firefighter husband, Thomas Araguz III, who died last year.
State District Judge Randy Clapp's ruling comes in a lawsuit filed by the firefighter's family. The suit claims their widow should collect nothing because they were born a man and Texas doesn't recognize same-sex marriages.
In their ruling signed last week and made public Tuesday, the Wharton County judge said the marriage was "void as a matter of law."
Clapp's decision was first made known early last week after attorneys in the case saw a draft of the decision.
The widow has previously said they would appeal.
For all the hullabaloo about the death of the real time strategy genre's death or decline the years from 2015 to 2017 were probably among the best stretch of three years in terms of games released since the early 2000's. In 2015 we saw the release of:
Age of Empires 2: The African Kingdoms
Act of Aggression
Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void
Grey Goo
2016 was nearly as good with the release of:
Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak
Ashes of the Singularity
Cossacks 3
Battlefleet Gothic: Armada
Offworld Trading Company (RTS economic warfare?)
8-Bit Armies and two expansions
That may lack the nostalgia factor of 1998 or 2000 but that is two years jam packed with high quality RTS games across the spectrum of playstyles. Then 2017 came along and dropped two of the highest production cost RTS games in some time (Dawn of War 3 and Halo Wars 2) along with the fourth game in a storied franchise (Sudden Strike 4) and a little gem that shifted the genre a bit (Tooth and Tail). Today I want to hand out a few awards and discuss how the year went as a whole for the genre that we love. First, the awards!
Best Graphics: Halo Wars 2
This was an interesting category this year as the main four titles released all had strong cases. The two big budget games rocked great engines while Sudden Strike 4 is no slouch. Throw in Tooth and Tail's unique visual style that is so enrapturing this was something I debated a great deal over but in the end I kept coming back to Halo Wars 2's beautiful visual style. While Dawn of War 3 is spectacular, especially the explosions, the lack of visual clarity and inconsistencies made me take Halo Wars 2 here. The smooth edges, clean effects and beautiful water and fire make the game pop even when it makes my PC chug just trying to keep up with it. Again Dawn of War 3 could take this spot and Tooth and Tail's design is worth mentioning but the details Halo Wars 2 uses while remaining so clean was so invaluable to me as player, and that was an area Dawn of War 3 struggled.
Best Campaign: Halo Wars 2
Wayward once wrote that the real time strategy often lacks memorable characters and I agree with them and this is one reason I am selecting Halo Wars 2 for my campaign of the year. Atriox is such an outstanding villain in so many ways. Their design is intimidating, their voice rumbles through your speakers or earphones and their actions prove they live up to their image. It isn't often a strategy game gives you a villain to fear. Blizzard's villains are generally humanized since you play as their factions and the classic Red Alert villains are full of camp and wonder but Atriox just drips power. Even playing as their faction you see their power and ruthlessness. The game supports this as well through exposition (Isabel's speech on them is one of my favorite in recent memory), gameplay and even the cut scenes. In the first Halo Wars game the Spartans were game enders who could alter a battle alone and in groups they were unstoppable but right away we see Atriox is different. Captain Cutter provides and excellent foil and we were already familiar with them from the first game. The game provides complex characters with strengths and weaknesses.Combine this wonderful villain with well designed, if generic, missions and excellent story telling and I dove head first into this universe.
I should note that both Dawn of War 3 and Tooth and Tail deserve praise here, both were amazing in entirely different way. Tooth and Tail's setting, story and universe was incredibly unique and beautiful and had a story that drew you in. Dawn of War 3's campaign was quite wonderful as well, filled with interesting missions and plenty of that classic Warhammer bombast. Both did lack the unique characters of Halo Wars though to me and that held them back the, along with length as both seemingly ended fairly abruptly.
Best Unit Design: Dawn of War 3
This could have gone to Tooth and Tail easily due to the units being animals in very funny and special circumstances but few universes provide the fun and crazy units like Warhammer and Dawn of War 3 does not disappoint. While there are balance and design issues that exist in the game the madness and wackiness the game provides overrides that for me. From the lowliest unit to the most powerful champion they oozed character and variety. The Orks have their natural inventiveness when it comes to their unit design and while the Space Marines and Eldar aren't up to that level they still have a lot of unit variety and different production mechanics. Their is just a sense of fun when you see your units in combat, from your leaping Space Marines to the sweeping blades of the Eldar to the creaking and sparking of the Orks.
Best Music Design: Tooth and Tail
Tooth and Tail is a unique game in almost every aspect. From the setting to the units to the gameplay, no game really compares and this applies to the music as well. The game combines the wonderful sweeping strings of traditional games during epic moments and throws in a great deal of early 20th century Russian music that only adds another layer of depth to an already immersive setting and world. Few games stand out in their music these days but Tooth and Tail is music I'd recognize right away and wouldn't turn off for a long time.
2017 Retrospect
Honestly this year gave me a lot of time playing new RTS games. While each game had their flaws:
– Dawn of War 3's struggles are myriad and Wayward has tackled many of the issues
– Halo Wars 2 struggled between its console roots and the move to PC
– Tooth and Tail's multiplayer design has issues with balance and comeback potential
– Sudden Strike 4 is a well rounded game but bugs, AI and multiplayer issues hold it back
But many of the games this year still stand out despite their flaws. I haven't replayed a campaign as many times as I did Halo Wars 2 since Starcraft 2. Dawn of War 3's multiplayer, while shallow at first, has pulled me back in with its trend setting map mechanics and Tooth and Tail's creative multiplayer and short matches makes me say “Just one more.” It has been a great year for the real time strategy after a few good years of great years. Honestly it is a good time to be a real time strategy fan, regardless if you want more tactics, micro, macro or planning, there has been something for everyone.

Sean Okoli turned toward The Bailey with their arms stretched out, basking in the spotlight.
Within Nippert Stadium's rowdiest fan section, supporters celebrated and lit orange smoke bombs.
After smashing a one-time volley for their second goal of the match, the flashiest Futbol Club Cincinnati player was well aware they were midway through the best performance in the club's brief history.
“I just want to show them that we appreciate their work,” Okoli said of scoring their first goal in front of The Bailey. “We want to entertain them, too.”
Okoli entertained. When they aren't involved in Cincinnati's 2-1 win over FC Montreal on Saturday, they dragged opposing defenders out of position to assist their teammates.
Okoli's first goal came in the 35th minute when they were bundled over for a penalty after an impressive run that sliced through the Montreal backline. Okoli powered the penalty kick into the bottom left corner of the net.
The second came from Eric Stevenson's well-hit cross that found the forward unmarked in the box. Okoli calmly tucked the goal away.
“An unbelievable, clinical finish,” head coach John Harkes said.
Playing a central attacking role in an overwhelmingly attacking team, Okoli has often been the final target of strong build-ups from the back.
One moment they can burst free into open space like a gazelle. The next, they can bullishly hold the ball for surrounding teammates to overlap.
Following the second goal, it was apparent that Okoli looked comfortable slithering through traffic to find open spots to receive the ball. Their runs on corners become more direct, and their follow-ups on shots that might lead to rebounded chances became more noticeable.
“Personalities make the game and the shape,” Harkes said. “We're a team that loves to create and open up the game.”
Okoli's growing confidence has been evident the past few weeks.
During a postgame interview after a 2-0 win over City Islanders FC on May 28, the forward waved off the notion they had been on a scoring drought. While they scored that night, Okoli hadn't scored since May 4.
Including the 28th, Okoli bagged four goals in three consecutive league matches, bumping their season total to a team-high seven.
The sudden burst in goal production might be from Okoli finishing chances at a higher rate. Another theory, though, could pin the recent spell on a formation shift.
Prior to the May 28 match, FC Cincinnati started the majority of matches in a 4-3-3 formation, with Okoli in the middle and Andrew Wiedeman and Jimmy McLaughlin on the flanks.
Okoli found chances, but their space to openly float around was limited.
Since that City Islander match, Cincinnati has switched to a 4-2-3-1 formation, which has more emphasis on the midfield and leaves Okoli as the sole forward.
“I know coaches have wanted me to stay more central as an outlet and pinpoint up front,” they said. “But at the same time, I think I can create outside, too. I just need to find that balance.”
Recently, he's struck that balance.

When they were subbed off in the 70th minute for Omar Cummings, Okoli acknowledged the crowd's applause with a clap and trotted back to the Cincinnati bench.
“I always knew the goals were going to come some way or another,” they said. “When you get two goals, you always want to get the third. But it's important to get the three points, too.”

New information is out regarding ongoing issues with the Winnipeg Transit's Peggo cards.
According to a report to the city's finance committee, on July 11, 2017 the Peggo system's capacity to load cards from online purchases was overloaded.
The contractor responsible for the system's support carried out emergency measures to return the system to operation.
But those actions caused a problem with some of the data responsible for transferring online purchases to customers' cards.
The contractor said it had resolved the problems with the system, and Winnipeg Transit fixed customers' unresolved issues, case by case.
The report says on Aug. 19, 2017 there was a second system failure, and some online orders did not transfer to customers' cards.
The report says the contractor has been working ever since to restore all products to cards.
A June report to the city's finance committee points out the city is withholding around $2.5 million in payments for the system, until the issues are fixed.
The Peggo card system was rolled out to seniors in July of 2016 and to full fare and youth passengers in the following August.

Doggerland is a submerged land mass beneath what is now the North Sea, that once connected Britain to continental Europe.
Named after the Dogger Bank, which in turn was named after the 17th century Dutch fishing boats called doggers.
The existence of Doggerland was first suggested in a late 19th century book “A Story of the Stone Age” by H.G. Wells, set in a prehistoric region where one might have walked dryshod from Europe to Britain.
The landscape was a diverse mix of gentle hills, marshes, wooded valleys and swamps. Mesolithic people took advantage of Doggerland's rich migrating wildlife and seasonal hunting grounds that has been evident in the ancient bones and tools embedded on the present sea floor brought to the surface by fishing trawlers.
Over time, the area was flooded by rising sea levels after the last glacial period around 6,500 to 6,200BC. Melting water that had been locked away caused the land to tilt in an isostatic adjustment as the huge weight of ice lessened.
﻿
Map showing hypothetical extent of Doggerland (c. 10,000 BC), which provided a land bridge between Great Britain and continental Europe
Doggerland eventually became submerged leaving only Dogger Bank, a possible moraine (accumulation of glacial debris) an island until around 5000BC when Dogger Bank also succumbed to the sea.
A recent theory suggests that much of the remaining coast and low-lying islands was flooded around 6225–6170 BC by a mega-tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide. (The Storegga slide was a landslide that involved an estimated 180 mile length of coastal shelf in the Norwegian Sea which caused a large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean).
Discoveries within the Doggerland region have included the remains of mammoth, rhinoceros and hunting artefacts that have all been dredged up from the sea floor of the North Sea.
In 1931, a famous discovery made the headlines when a trawler named Colinda hauled up a lump of peat whilst fishing near the Ower Bank, 25 miles off the English coast. To the astonishment of the fisherman, the peat contained an ornate barbed antler point used for harpooning fish that dated from between 4,000-10,000 BC.
Other extensive discoveries of prehistoric finds have included textile fragments, paddles and Mesolithic dwellings just off the coast of Denmark. In addition, settlements with sunken floors, dugout canoes, fish traps and a number of burials in the Rhine/Meuse delta of the Netherlands, and a skull fragment of a Neanderthal, dated at over 40,000 years old dredged from the Middeldiep off the coast of Zeeland.
Divers have even discovered patches of prehistoric forests, like the discovery in 2015 off the coast of Norfolk, when the research group “Seasearch” was studying marine life and unexpectedly found remains of compressed trees and branches.
Several Universities have presently been involved in numerous studies in order to map the geology of Doggerland, understand the flora and fauna of this forgotten land.
The story of Doggerland is a cautious warning as to the power nature wields in shaping the landscape through climate change. Entire peoples found themselves displaced as the sea encroached on a region larger than many European countries. Today, over 1 billion people live close to coastlines, in vulnerable areas.

Story highlights Fareed Zakaria said voters should look to Trump's past to see their true character
They called the Republican presidential nominee "obnoxious, tacky and vulgar"
(CNN) CNN's Fareed Zakaria delivered an impassioned monologue Sunday, in which they underlined why they would not be voting for Donald Trump on November 8.
Zakaria has made no secret in the past of their opposition to the Republican presidential candidate, but they emphasized in an op-ed for The Washington Post and on their show "GPS" that they wanted to explain "one last time why Donald Trump is worth special attention."
"I am not a highly partisan person. I have views that are left of center, but others that are conservative," Zakaria said.
"I think well of many Republican politicians, including the last two GOP presidential nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney, both of whom are honorable men and would have been good presidents."
"Donald Trump is different," Zakaria said.

New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency has found no evidence of wrongdoing in most of the 90 "love jihad" cases it is probing in Kerala, a senior official of the federal anti-terror agency said.
But they added that the agency harboured "prima facie" suspicion of induced conversions and radicalisation in nine cases.
"We are examining 90 inter-faith marriages that took place in Kerala in the past two years. Till now, we have found a prima facie pattern in only nine cases of Hindu women having been brainwashed into converting to Islam," the official said.
"We are investigating the possible role played by a radical Islamic outfit, the Popular Front of India (PFI), and its political wing, the Social Democratic Party of India."
In September, Kerala police had under state high court orders handed over these 90 cases to the NIA to probe whether they were part of a "love jihad" conspiracy. The term refers to an alleged plan by extremist groups to indoctrinate, convert and induce Hindu girls into love marriages with Muslims, with the aim of recruiting them as terrorists.
A second NIA official claimed two of the nine women under the scanner -residents of Palakkad and Kasaragod - had acknowledged being brainwashed by the PFI into eloping and marrying Muslims.
Union home ministry sources said there was a proposal to ban the PFI under the anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The outfit has denied the terror and "love jihad" charges.
Under a Supreme Court directive, the NIA is also probing the case of 25-year-old Hadiya, whose father Ashokan alleges they were forced into converting to Islam and marrying a Muslim.
Kerala High Court had nullified the marriage in May on the ground that the woman had been brainwashed and radicalised. The Supreme Court will hear Hadiya out on November 27.

Editor's Note: This is part of our ongoing news coverage of Japan's earthquake and nuclear emergency.
Japanese roboticists plan to use the KOHGA3 ground robot (shown here during a test) to inspect a collapsed building in Hachinohe, in the northeastern portion of Honshu island.
Japan is mobilizing more robots to assist with rescue and recovery operations after the 9.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the country last Friday.
As we reported earlier, two teams are on standby, ready to deploy ground and snake-like robots. One team is based in Tokyo and the other in Sendai, but they are prepared to travel anywhere in Japan where they are needed.
Now I've learned that two other teams are also ready to field their robots. A group led by Prof. Eiji Koyanagi from Chiba Institute of Technology received a request from a company in Kajima, in the Chiba Prefecture, eastern of Tokyo, for a robot that can inspect underwater infrastructure (the roboticists are not allowed to disclose the name of the company and the nature of the infrastructure). Prof. Koyanagi visited the site to assess what robot could be used.
Another team, led by Prof. Fumitoshi Matsuno from Kyoto University, who's vice president of the International Rescue System Institute, is traveling to Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture, to help inspect a building whose ceiling collapsed. Their group will work with colleagues from the Hachinohe Institute of Technology to send in a ground robot called KOHGA3 [photo above].
Below is a video of KOHGA3 during a recent exercise at Disaster City, a simulated collapsed town in College Station, Texas, and the world's largest training facility for urban search and rescue.
The activities in Kajima and Hachinohe don't involve searching for survivors. They are recovery missions with the goal of ascertain damage and plan the next steps in terms of repairs and reconstruction.
In fact, recovery, rather than search and rescue, should be the focus of most robot operations from now on. The Japanese teams, however, remain prepared to assist emergency responders should their robots become necessary.
Prof. Satoshi Tadokoro from Tohoku University and president of the International Rescue System Institute tells me they contacted the fire departments of Sendai and Kobe, as well as the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Tohoku Branch and various businesses, to inform that their team's robots are available for any kind of mission. They say robots would be particularly useful to look for damages at warehouses and factories.
"I offered robotic inspection of damaged factories, particularly of dangerous locations like a chemical plant," they say.
Tadokoro, Koyanagi, Matsuno, and their colleagues Tetsuya Kimura, from Nagaoka University of Technology, and Katsuji Ohgane, from Niigata Institute of Technology -- among the leading Japanese experts in rescue robotics -- were actually in the United States when the earthquake struck. They were testing their robots at Disaster City and participating in a workshop organized by the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR) at Texas A&M University, headed by Prof. Robin Murphy, another authority in rescue robotics. The researchers are also members of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society.
The teams flew home as soon as they heard about the quake, arriving in Japan the next day. Prof. Tadokoro left Narita airport driving to their home in Sendai carrying on the trunk of their vehicle a tank-like ground robot called Quince and the Active Scope Camera, a remote-controlled snake-like robot.
Quince [photo, right], developed as part of Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) project, is a creation of researchers led by Prof. Tadokoro and Prof. Koyanagi, with support from the International Rescue System Institute.
The Active Scope Camera is one of several Japanese robots that have actually been used in real disasters. Below is a photo showing the device at the site of the Berkman Plaza 2 parking garage collapse in Jacksonville, Fl., in 2008.
Here's a video of the Active Scope Camera during a demonstration:
As they drove to Sendai, through roads away from the ocean, Prof. Tadokoro didn't see many collapsed buildings; most destruction in this area was caused by the tsunami. That means their robots probably won't be needed here, as they're best suited for inspecting rubble and damaged structures.
But Prof. Tadokoro and their colleagues don't have time to rest. With recovery operations just beginning and the possibility of more aftershocks as well as the threat of a nuclear crisis, the roboticists and their robots remain on standby.

LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Israel's blockade of building materials for Gaza has created one of the highest levels of unemployment in the world and made it impossible for the small coastal enclave to recover from the war a year ago, aid agencies said on Wednesday.

Less than one percent of the materials needed for reconstruction have been allowed into the enclave, the international charity Christian Aid said.
Israel has blockaded Gaza, placing restrictions on people and goods leaving the enclave and goods entering it, since the Islamist group Hamas won power in Gaza in elections in 2006.
The blockade has isolated Gaza from the rest of the world, “helped to create some of the highest unemployment and aid dependency levels in the world, and must be brought to an end,” Christian Aid spokesperson William Bell said in a statement.
Israel launched “Operation Protective Edge” on July 8, 2014 in response to rocket fire into Israel by militants in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli air strikes and shelling hammered the densely populated enclave for 50 days, causing widespread destruction of homes, schools and other buildings, and killing more than 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians.
Thousands of Gazans were made homeless, 100,000 homes were damaged and more than 12,000 destroyed, none of which have been rebuilt.
The aid agency Oxfam said Gaza's economy was increasingly reliant on international aid, on which 80 percent of its 1.8 million residents depend.
Unemployment is among the highest in the world, with almost 68 percent of those under 24 jobless, it said.
The lack of opportunities is forcing a growing number of young people to risk their lives or arrest by trying to climb the border fence into Israel to look for work, Oxfam said.
The slow pace of reconstruction - estimated to take more than 70 years - means teenagers in Gaza will be old by the time it is completed, the agency said.
Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians.

- Transformed hair color
- Assuming "Tedd" is male
- Confused by Sam
Grace's defnition in panel five is an oversimplification and specific to what she's assuming Sam thinks about Tedd ("Transgender" can refer to many things). Just wanna make my awareness of that clear. That said, if I do make some manner of terminology mistake or something at some point, feel free to politely yell at me.
Side note on the subject of panel five: I think Grace is cute in it.
I had never heard of "Tedd" (or "Ted") being a feminine name prior to bringing up the assumption that it was a male-exclusive name in the comic. Since then, I have learned that it can be short for several feminine names, but it's apparently common for people to not be aware of that.
End result: It's not a plot hole for characters to not realize it can be a girl's name, but it would be a jerk move to not point out that it can be now that I know better. As an added bonus, that fact has given me certain ideas that I will not elaborate upon at this time.
“Beware - Do Not Add To Recent Deaths - Danger of Death” says the sign in English, French, Arabic and several other languages posted on the barbed wire fence around the Channel Tunnel terminal.
But the stark warning is not enough to deter the hundreds of desperate migrants who try night after night to find a breach in the fence believing that they will find a better life at the other end of the tunnel.
The situation in the French port has reached fever pitch in recent days , and the situation is only set to get worst as camps swell and those caught attempting to get through the fence are released to try again.
The nightly ritual at the terminal now sees around 2,000 attempts and Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has voiced concerns migrants may be rushing to make their bid before more secure fencing - paid for by Britain - goes up in the next few days.
Those waiting for the cover of darkness to try and break through looked panicked by the idea of tighter security.
Others blamed the surge on improved conditions on the Mediterranean, meaning more people have been able to reach the continent via Libya and Egypt.
Uhrad, 30, an Eritrean accountant who reached the Calais camp on Thursday night, said that having made it this far they would not be deterred by tightened security.
Summing up the determination at the port they said: "You know people will make a way - they will dig under the fence. The ferries became too difficult so now they are trying the trains. People will swim if that's too difficult."
By around 2 am the port was buzzing with activity, with French riot police watching from a distance, ready to move in when they spotted migrants climbing over or cutting their way through the daunting double fence that is lined with barbed wire at the top, bottom and the space in between.
“I don't care if they put a fire there. I'll still get over it,” said 28-year-old Darood, who claims they had fled their native Ethiopia after most of their family members were killed.
• The Latest updates: David Cameron chairs Cobra crisis talks as British Army on standby
They watched keenly as a train carrying lorries lumbered by under the floodlights just a few dozen yards away, about to be swallowed up by the tunnel that leads under the Channel to England.
Darood didn't make it through, but said they would keep trying until they finally did get to the country which they and most of the other migrants here see as some sort of El Dorado where their lives will rapidly improve.
Many have made it, and many more are likely to do so as police admit they are simply overwhelmed by the growing numbers of migrants who have recently turned their attention away from Calais ferry port - after security was tightened there - to make their desperate bids at the tunnel terminal.
"It's like trying to swat moles,” said Claude Verri of the UNSA police union. “All we can do is take them out of the terminal area and then leave them there. And then five minutes later they can be back inside again."
• David Cameron blames Calais crisis on 'swarm' of migrants
• Why so many migrants flee Eritrea: world's most repressive regimes
Exactly how many eventually get to England no-one knows, but UK officials say that they prevented 18,000 stowaways from entering the country between January 1 and May 21 this year.
Some die in their attempt. At least ten have lost their lives since June alone, through electrocution or after falling off trains or lorries they were trying to clamber onto.
In the latest death officials said that a migrant had leapt onto a Eurotunnel shuttle train but smashed their head on the platform. They died on Tuesday from their injuries.
There is a cat and mouse game between the police migrants. Every time a hole in the fence is made workers fix it. Lines of officers try and push them back toward the “Jungle” - the vast shanty town among sand dunes several miles away.
There was a moment of tension but the confrontation was mostly good-humoured, with one officer's appeal to the migrants to “Come back tomorrow” was met with laughter. “We want to go today,” someone shouted back.
“If we had no problems in our countries we wouldn't be here,” said Abdurahmen, a young Sudanese man who said they had taken a perilous journey through Libya and then across the Mediterranean on a rickety boat to reach Europe.
“None of us want to live like this. I just want to live in Britain, make a family, take my kids to school,” they said. Police said on Thursday that overnight they had “arrested” around 300 people trying to break into the tunnel terminal.
But in fact all they do is take migrants who have breached the fence - or tried to - and put them on a bus that at dawn deposits them at a roundabout on the edge of Calais.
From there they head back to the Jungle and rest for the day before planning their next assault on the terminal.
The massive migrant presence, combined with wildcat strike action by ferry workers, have this summer crippled Calais and caused travel chaos for holidaymakers and truckers alike as ferry and train services were repeatedly brought to a halt.

• Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner: 'We must send in the army'
Many people of Calais express sympathy for the plight of the migrants - many of them women and children - but say their town has suffered enough and the crisis must be resolved.
"Calais is suffocating. The tourists have stopped coming here because all they see on the telly is stories about migrants and they are afraid to come," said Gilles Duvauchelle, the owner of Le Bounty café in the town centre.
Several customers at the bar nodded in agreement, with one woman saying that Britons used to come in large numbers to stock up on wine and French food in the hypermarkets on the edge of town. But now they have dwindled to a trickle, they said.
"The government is incompetent," said Mr Duvauchelle.
"When migrant camps build up in Paris they move them on. But when they're here in Calais they don't give a damn.”

Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX)
The Texas Board of Education creates "policies and standards for Texas public schools." Gov. Greg Abbott's choice to head this body setting policies and standards for Texas public schools is a woman whose own children never attended those public schools —they were homeschooled and then sent to a private high school. But hey, she's a former aide to the state's Republican lieutenant governor.
The problem here seems obvious.
Even Republican State Board member Thomas Ratliff called the move a mistake. “Public school isn't for everybody, but when 94 percent of our students in Texas attend public schools I think it ought to be a baseline requirement that the chair of the State Board of Education have at least some experience in that realm, as a parent, teacher, something,” Ratliff argued.
Bahorich's relevant experience, as listed on their LinkedIn profile , includes "founder/director/board member" of Home Ed Plus, which "provides the opportunity for homeschool families and Christian teachers to come together in support of a high quality academic education for homeschooled students." Naturally she's also a huge supporter of charter schools. Basically any way of getting students out of public schools ... the public schools for which she'll play a major role in setting policy.

A survey released this week by WalletHub found that both beer and wine prices could vary by almost 100% depending on the city. For example, the average price of a six-pack of beer (either 12-ounce cans or 1.5 liter bottles) in Baton Rouge, La. — which boasts the cheapest beer in America — was just $7.41, compared with $13.31 in both Aurora, Ill., and Chicago — which are tied for the honor of the priciest beer in the nation, beating the runner-up by more than $3.

So what's with the vast price variations when it comes to booze? “There's no single explanation,” says IBISWorld alcohol industry analyst Nick Petrillo. “Rather, the price of alcohol varies because of unique regional characteristics, laws and, to a greater extent, people's ability to dictate with their wallets what they will and will not pay for a drink.”
But no matter where you live, there are plenty of ways to save on booze. Here are a few:
Shop later in the year
“Some of the best prices on wine are in October, when most wineries are releasing their new vintages; they want to clear out the old to bring these in,” says Teri Gault, CEO of The Grocery Game. And surprisingly, the holidays might yield some deals: Gault says that during the holidays, many drugstores deeply discount alcohol, so it might pay to shop there then; just be sure to price check.
Know where to shop
Costco and Sam's Club often have great deals on alcohol. Kendal Perez, a savings expert with Coupon Sherpa, says they find their favorite wines for $2 to $5 less at Sam's than at local liquor stores. “Wines at warehouse club stores are usually about 30% less than a wine store,” says Gault.
Gault says that you can get some significant deals at supermarkets and drugstores when you use instant rebates, which many offers. “Sometimes, supermarkets, like Ralphs, a Kroger banner, offer a mix and match of 6 wines purchased and gives $15 in instant credit for groceries at the register,” they say. They also offer coupons often. Gault says that BevMo is also a good bet.
Buy in bulk — and if that isn't feasible, haggle
Many stores discount alcohol if you buy by the case, says Gault. It can also pay to ask for a reduced or discounted price (point out that you're a loyal customer); you won't always get it but it's worth a shot.
The following statement was issued March 24 by the International Action Center in advance of a demonstration outside the United Nations in New York set for 5 p.m. on the same day. It was 15 years ago on this day that the United States began bombing Serbia in its quest to break up Yugoslavia and further expand NATO. The demonstration will demand recognition of Kosovo as part of Serbia and U.S./NATO hands off the Balkans, Ukraine and Russia.
On the 15th anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Serbia, and as new, even more ominous dangers arise in Ukraine and Crimea, it is important to remember history.
Wall Street dominates peoples through the destructive strategy of “divide and rule.” In the Balkans and in Eastern Europe this has meant policies aimed at breaking solidarity among different nationalities and religions by imposing sanctions and economic destabilization and by funding right-wing and fascist organizations and granting immediate recognition to their regimes.
It was U.S. and European Union criminal policy that broke the Yugoslav Federation into six unstable, impoverished micro-states. They executed this crime by bombing Bosnia in 1994 and carrying out a 78-day bombing in 1999 of Serbia, especially the Serbian province of Kosovo. These wars aimed at expanding the U.S.-commanded NATO alliance into the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Republics.
Despite U.S. and German commitments to the former Soviet Union not to expand NATO one inch further if Soviet troops were withdrawn from East Germany, NATO has now expanded to 12 countries in the Balkans, Eastern Europe and former Soviet Republics.
After the massive destruction of schools, hospitals, industries and communication in Yugoslavia in 1999, Washington still agreed, in the imposed ceasefire and in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, that Kosovo is historically part of Serbia and would remain an autonomous part of sovereign Serbia, although under U.S./NATO occupation and administration. In 2008, in violation of this signed U.N. agreement, the U.S. recognized the puppet government it had set up and that government's illegal declaration of independence for Kosovo. The overwhelming majority of the people of Serbia of all nationalities opposed this theft of Kosovo by NATO. They continue to raise the slogan: “Kosovo is Serbia.”
PORTLAND, Ore. – T2 goalkeeper Kendall McIntosh today was named the USL Player of the Week for Week 19 of the 2017 season after recording a pair of penalty-kick saves in Portland's 2-1 victory over Rio Grande Valley FC Toros on July 29. McIntosh received 57 percent of the poll conducted by a national panel of independent media representing every USL market. Tampa Bay Rowdies midfielder Alex Morrell finished second with 26 percent of the poll.
McIntosh, who previously earned a spot on the USL Team of the Week for Week 2 and Week 18, made the first penalty stop in the 53rd minute when they made a diving save to their left on midfielder Jose Escalante's attempt in the second half. McIntosh, who leads the USL with 65 saves, recorded their second penalty-kick save when they made another diving save to their left on midfielder Todd Wharton's effort in the 88th minute to preserve the victory.
Additionally, T2 midfielder Villyan Bijev was also named to the Team of the Week after recording the game-winning goal in the 81st minute. Midfielder Omar Mohamed played a scooped pass to Bijev on the edge of the 18-yard box, and their half-volleyed effort was struck into the far lower corner of the net. The goal was Bijev's team-leading seventh of the season.
Up next, T2 travel to face Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC at Weidner Field on Saturday, Aug. 5; kickoff is set for 5 p.m. (Pacific). The Aug. 5 match will also be available via a live, high-definition web stream at www.timbers2.com.
Company claimed that city's proposed regulations would have ended local service
Sarasota city commissioners unanimously voted Tuesday to abandon their months-long quest to regulate ride-hailing services such as Uber and, at the same time, decided to strip existing regulations on taxicabs, in a surprise move that animated a standing-room only crowd.
Uber supporters who packed the commission chambers at City Hall erupted in applause after the vote, which capped about one hour of discussion on the matter and eliminated the need for what likely would have been a long public hearing. Forty-six people had signed up to speak.
Although most people cheered, the vote made one person angry. Taxicab driver Patrick Vancil threw their taxi ID badge at commissioners upon leaving the chambers.
“I won't be needing this anymore,” they said before abruptly walking out.
Vancil later told reporters they have been driving a cab for about one year and is upset that the city failed to impose the same regulations on Uber as it has done for so long on cabs.
“What's going to happen when someone gets hurt, when someone gets killed,” Vancil said.
Vancil declined to name their employer.
Since entering the Sarasota market in December, Uber has threatened the traditional taxicab business with its hundreds of drivers offering cheaper fares.
The company uses a web-based platform allowing passengers to digitally hail a vehicle driven by one of its independent contractors whose fares are generally much lower than regular cabs.
The venture has been successful, as evidenced by a growing number of residents who use the service.
But it's also been largely unregulated. The city intended to change that and drew up a proposal to regulate Uber the same as taxis.
The plan faced criticism by Uber officials, who claimed it would place unfair burdens on its independent drivers and force the company to stop operating in Sarasota. But it had the support of cab companies, which hoped it would level the playing field.
Uber said late last week the proposed rules would end service in the city and suggested, instead, its own alternative ordinance.
The city could have voted to adopt its ordinance as it was written and risk Uber's withdrawal, it could have amended the ordinance to fit Uber's likening, or it could have rejected it altogether, said city attorney Bob Fournier.
Commissioner Susan Chapman said if the city decides against regulating Uber, it shouldn't regulate taxis, either.
Other commissioners agreed.
“We shouldn't be defending taxicabs against their competitors,” said Commissioner Suzanne Atwell. “You are the competitors.”
Atwell earned applause when they said they used Uber to get to City Hall earlier that day and hoped to get an Uber ride back home.
“We are thankful that the commission sees the value that our driver partners bring to this community,” said Christine Mitchell, Uber's general manager for Sarasota, after the meeting.
Mitchell said Uber has hundreds of drivers in Sarasota.
Unlike cab drivers, though, Uber drivers aren't employed by the company. They work as independent operators who use their own vehicles, buy their own gas and pay for their own maintenance.
Derrick Turizo is one such driver. But they also own their own cab company, Sunset Taxi. They started driving for Uber on the side because they figure it's the future of the industry.
In a typical week driving their cab, Turizo said they earn $1,500. A typical week for Uber, by contrast, brings in about $300, according to their weekly tally provided by the app.
“It's the future,” they said, “but it's not as profitable. It turned what used to be a full-time career into something where you're only going to earn part-time money.”
Many Uber drivers praised the company and the opportunities it provided. Mary Acosta said they drive part time to make ends meet after having lost their corporate job earlier this year. Without Uber, they said, they wouldn't eat.
There weren't many new details unveiled Tuesday when the full police report was released on New Orleans Saints linebacker Junior Galette's Jan. 5 arrest.
As the Kenner, La., police department announced after booking Galette on a misdemeanor charge of simple battery involving domestic violence, they were accused of pushing a woman twice and knocking them to the ground while trying to get them to leave theirs home.
Both the New Orleans Advocate and The Times-Picayune obtained copies of the report. According to both publications, Galette and their cousin Terrance Banks denied that Galette ever touched the unidentified woman, who claimed that the two men “jumped” her, causing an earring to be ripped out and their face to be scratched. Galette's attorney later claimed the lost earring was caused by a dog that jumped on them while reacting to them yelling.
Among a few new details in the report was an account from police of what was seen on the cellphone videos of the incident that Galette recorded. It showed the woman holding a knife, repeatedly asking that the police be called and requesting that their cellphone be returned to them Both the accuser and the accused confirmed that they waved a knife at one point before dropping it and being physically removed from the home by Banks.
Galette and the woman have also given conflicting accounts of their relationship, with Galette describing them as a “dancer” who spent the night, while the woman claimed to have lived with or stayed with Galette during the past two years.
According to the police report, one other man and two other women were present in Galette's home at the time of the incident, including a woman described as Galette's girlfriend.
One other related detail that was revealed Tuesday was that Banks and two other people were arrested on counts of illegal drug possession while driving Galette's car a week after the initial incident. Galette was not in the car at the time -- and their attorney, Ralph Whalen, issued a statement saying Galette was “disturbed and disappointed by what he's heard about the behavior of the individuals involved.”
Galette's first hearing is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 26.

On the day after the 36th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, President Barack Obama repealed a Reagan-era policy that prohibited foreign nongovernmental family-planning groups from receiving U.S. funds if they provided abortions or even lobbied for abortion rights in their country. It is an action their abortion-rights supporters have waited eight years for and one they had encouraged them to waste no time taking. But by first issuing a statement urging support for common-ground efforts to reduce abortion rates and then waiting to sign the Executive Order late on a Friday afternoon  a time traditionally reserved for the release of information an Administration would like to bury  Obama sent a clear signal that they want to turn down the heat on an issue that has defined and divided American politics for more than three decades. (See pictures behind the scenes at the Inauguration.)
The Mexico City policy, as it is known, has been one of the most visible differences between the two major political parties on the issue of abortion, in part because incoming Presidents have taken action on it within days of entering the White House. Bill Clinton repealed the policy on Jan. 22, 1993, citing their concern that the ban prevented women and children from receiving health services. Eight years later, George W. Bush reinstated the policy on Jan. 22, 2001. "It is my conviction," Bush said, "that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad." (View new fronts in the abortion battle.)
Bush's statement is one being echoed by supporters of the policy today. But in fact, since 1973, federal law has banned the use of U.S. taxpayer funds for abortions in other countries. What the Mexico City policy did was take that prohibition several steps further. Under the policy, NGOs that applied for family-planning funds from the U.S. Agency on International Development (USAID) had to refrain from using any of their own funds to provide abortion (with exceptions for cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the mother). The organizations also were not eligible if they lobbied to make or keep abortion legal in their own country or if they provided abortion referrals  a requirement that led many opponents of the policy to dub it a "global gag rule."
As a result of the policy  which is named for the city in which the Reagan Administration first announced it at the 1984 United Nations International Conference on Population  some groups, including Planned Parenthood organizations in Romania and Colombia, altered their activities in order to qualify and continued to receive funding. But at least 16 developing nations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East have been affected, with all NGOs in those countries denied U.S. funding to help provide contraceptives and other much needed services.

We got tipped to this story. But we weren't able to confirm it. WaPo did. On the day after their inauguration, the President of the United States personally called the head of the National Park Service to berate them over unflattering tweets from various NPS social media accounts and the pictures that were being used to demonstrate that President Trump's inauguration crowded paled in comparison to President Obama's and later the women's march.
From the write-up by two of the profession's masters, Karen Tumulty and Juliet Eilperin …
In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day's crowds on the National Mall, according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation. The president believed that they might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average.
Later in the article …
Reynolds was taken aback by Trump's request, but did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the White House through normal channels in the Interior Department, the sources said. The photos, however, did not prove Trump's contention that the crowd size was upwards of 1 million.
It's difficult to fully grasp what a child this man appears to be. To place this in time, this was their first full day in office, the same day they made their off-the-rails appearance at the CIA, simultaneous with the Women's March unfolding out the White House and sometime before they sent Sean Spicer before the White House press corps to berate reporters for making them feel bad.
Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson is one step away from being the 2013 Madden video game series cover athlete.
Johnson continued their path of destruction, blowing out popular Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers in the semifinals, 67-33 percent.
Johnson will meet reigning Rookie of the Year, Cam Newton, in the finals. They emerged victorious in a suprisingly hard-fought battle with San Francisco 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis.
The winner will be announced live, April 25, on ESPN's show SportsNation. You can vote here.
The Lions' star wide receiver appeared on a number of ESPN radio and television programs on Tuesday to promote their candidacy. They explained what a victory in the contest would mean to him.
"One, you've never seen a Detroit player on the cover," Johnson said. "Two, it would be huge for the city. You can only imagine. Then, after that, it gives a lot to my foundation and my charities I work with back home and in Detroit."
Leading up to the finals, there has been plenty of concern expressed by Detroit fans about the potential of the Madden curse affecting the Lions. Even teammate Nate Burleson is a believer, but he'll still be casting their vote for Johnson.
"I'm just saying, if any guy can break the curse it's Calvin," Burleson said. "This dude is a monster. He's strong enough to break tackles, so they can break a curse."
Here's a brief recap on how we got to this point in the tournament:
Johnson defeated teammate Matthew Stafford in the play-in round, followed by victories over Dwayne Bowe (92-8), Arian Foster (73-27), Rob Gronkowski (63-37) and Rodgers.
Newton bested LaGarrette Blount (87-13), Antonio Gates (83-17), Larry Fitzgerald (70-30) and Willis.
Steganography is the process of hiding an encrypted message in some otherwise innocent looking format. We've gone over some ways to do this in the past with image files, but now you can take it to a whole new level by hiding an entire TrueCrypt volume in an mp4 video file.
Advertisement
First you need a suitable mp4 file to hide your TrueCrypt container. I used a video from the NASA website, just click "Download video" to get your mp4 file. Really any mp4 file will do, but try to find a file that matches the proportional size of the container you are going to create.
Create the TrueCrypt Container
Once you have your video file, create a TrueCrypt container. Use the "Hidden Container" option, this generates a container-inside-a-container. Name it 'innocuous-looking-file.mp4' or something similar, and fill out the options regarding the volume size and passwords.
Advertisement
Merge The Video File And The Container
Now that you have your two files, the magic happens. Martin Fiedler, a software engineer from Germany, created a Python script named tcsteg.py that will now merge these two files together. Execute "python tcsteg.py Movie.mp4 NameOfTrueCryptVolume.mp4" from a command line to make the merge.
The resulting file is very secure, and hard to detect:
There are only four ways to detect the presence of the hidden volume, all of which are unlikely to be checked even by a knowledgeable person. The easiest way to tell about the manipulation would be bitrate monitoring: If a player tells you that the stream has a bitrate of 1 Mbps, but by analyzing the file size, you can compute that it must have at least 5 Mbps, you can tell something is amiss. But who looks at bitrates this detailed? The only other ways would be (1) a sophisticated packet-by-packet analysis of the mdat data that would find out that from offset 65,536 on, there's not only random-looking compressed data, but random-looking garbage; (2) checking for a repetition of the first 64k or mdat somewhere later in the file and (3) seeing that there's much unused space in the mdat that isn't referenced by any chunk offset table.

To remount the volume, just enter the mp4 as a TrueCrypt container and make sure to mark that there is a hidden volume along with the password.
I tested out the process from beginning to end and it was very easy to do. Let us know if it works for you or if you have any questions about the process!

Undrafted and waived twice in the same month of their first full NHL season, Chris Kunitz never would have envisioned that one day they would be sitting third overall in scoring in the top league in the world.
But the story of Chris Kunitz is one that young minor hockey players should embrace.
They stuck with it. And they believed in himself.
"Definitely a late bloomer," the two-time Stanley Cup winner told ESPN.com Wednesday. "I didn't even think myself that the NHL was something that could be realistic until I signed out of college. I played Tier 2 junior, nobody very often gets drafted out of the SJHL."
And yet from the Melville Millionaires of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League to four years at Ferris State University in Michigan (where they scored 63 goals in 77 games their last two regular seasons), the NHL finally did call.
Enter David McNab. The longtime Anaheim Ducks executive -- who was assistant GM at the time -- deserves the credit for spotting Kunitz and seeing something in them that many other NHL teams did not.
"Definitely, I talked to them quite a bit starting near the end of my junior year and then throughout my senior year," Kunitz said. "I sat down and had talks with them and they told me they were interested in me and certainly they were definitely an integral part."
McNab, who worked under GM Bryan Murray at the time, signed Kunitz to their first pro contract on April 1, 2003. It was no April Fool's joke.
Kunitz spent most of the next two seasons with AHL Cincinnati where, as fate would have it, their future home in Pittsburgh was likely born. First, current Penguins coach Dan Bylsma was an assistant coach on that Cincinnati team in 2004-05 and watched firsthand as Kunitz collected 22 goals and 39 points in 54 games that season, plus eight points (1 goal-7 assists) in 12 playoff games. It's also during this time that Chuck Fletcher, who was the director of hockey operations in Anaheim, kept close tabs on what was going on with the Ducks' farm club. Meanwhile, Ray Shero, then the assistant GM in Nashville, was overseeing the AHL's Milwaukee team, which played Cincinnati a lot, including the playoffs.
In the spring of 2006, Shero was named GM in Pittsburgh and brought along Fletcher from the Ducks to be their assistant GM. Bylsma joined the Penguins organization the same year as an assistant coach in AHL Wilkes-Barre.
So when the Penguins traded for Kunitz in February 2009, it's not hard to see why they felt comfortable with the player they were acquiring.
"I guess we had it covered and knew the player well," Shero told ESPN.com.
Kunitz's first full NHL season in 2005-06 had a bizarre start though. The Ducks waived them in early October, and Atlanta claimed them but played them only twice before putting them back on waivers three weeks later, at which point Anaheim re-claimed him.
"The Ducks had gone through new ownership, a new GM, a new coach, David McNab was still there but I was among the first cuts out of camp and that was disappointing," Kunitz said. "But they obviously still wanted me since they re-claimed me."
They would go on to pot 19 goals and 41 points in 67 games with Anaheim that season, the Ducks dodging a major bullet in their ability to re-claim the Regina native on waivers.
The following season, which saw Kunitz put up 25 goals and 60 points, they were a Cup champion playing an important role on a line with Andy McDonald and Teemu Selanne.
Kunitz brought the Cup back to Regina in the summer of 2007 and life could not have been any better.
Just a year and a half later, they were sent to along with Eric Tangradi to Pittsburgh in a deal that netted the Ducks Ryan Whitney. And like any player traded for the first time, it hit them like a jack-hammer.
"It was a tough situation," Kunitz said. "I had just signed a four-year extension the summer before. And then the next February I get traded. You don't really realize the business side of the game until you first get traded. It was tough, a lot of time talking to my wife and figuring things out."
The Ducks were in Boston the day they were dealt, McNab delivering the news to them personally. Kunitz remembers former superstar blueliner Scott Niedermayer being there on their way out that day.

"Scott Niedermayer told me then, 'Good luck, it'll be a great move for your career.' That was great wisdom from him, which helped make it easier," Kunitz said. "I ended up winning the Cup later that year."
Kunitz put up 14 points (1 goal-13) assists in 24 playoff games for the Penguins.
They followed that up with a 23-goal, 48-point season in 2010-11, and last season they had career-highs of 26 goals and 61 points.
So he's certainly been tracking upwards. This is why, while most outside observers are stunned at their incredible production this season -- 37 points (18 goals-19 assists) in 27 games before Thursday's game at Toronto -- Crosby is not.
"I think it's not a surprise," Crosby told ESPN.com Wednesday. "He's found maybe more of a scoring touch than he's had in the past, but I think he's doing a lot of the same things and it's just nice he's getting results and getting recognized. Because they do a lot of things out there that leads to success."
The doubters will point to the fact Kunitz is playing on a line with the best player in the world in Crosby. But the best player in the world is quick to point out that Kunitz has helped their game as well.
"He's a great guy to play with," Crosby said. "Anyone who has played with them will tell you that they do so many little things.
"He's always been a guy that really goes to the net hard, every shift he's always around the net, but I think he's also finding different areas to score, too. I've never seen them in areas where he's just more ready to shoot as they are this year. He's finding different ways to score."
A veteran scout for a Western Conference team who has watched Kunitz play many times over the years believes this is no fluke.
"He's not just an opportunist, he's got speed, he's got edge, and he's got finish," the scout told ESPN.com Thursday. "Those three things, even just two of those things, can put you in a good spot. But when you have all three and playing with a guy that clearly is going in Crosby, you're going to produce. And they've got so many weapons on that team, it's hard to focus on just a few guys. Yes, he's having a year like he's never had, but it's not as if he's come out of nowhere. He's always been a player with tremendous competitiveness and has always gone to the tough areas where you need to go to."
Kunitz played mostly with Evgeni Malkin last season when Crosby missed a big chunk recovering from their concussion issues.
Malkin won the Hart Trophy. This season Kunitz is back with Crosby and guess who's the leading candidate to win the Hart?
Kunitz sounded embarrassed when that little trend was suggested to him.
"I don't think that at all," they chuckled. "The skill set that our top two centers have here, I've been pretty lucky to play with both at different times over the past few years. A lot of fun to play with those guys."
Kunitz and Crosby skated together during the lockout and that re-energized their chemistry as well.
"We were fortunate during the lockout to be skating all together and watching what they were doing every day on the ice and how hard they worked," Kunitz said. "That pushes us to work harder and get better to try and keep up with him."
Fact is, Kunitz has been blessed indeed in terms of linemates in their NHL career. He's skated alongside the likes of McDonald, Selanne and Ryan Getzlaf in Anaheim. Then they get Crosby and Malkin in Pittsburgh.
"I definitely can't complain," laughed Kunitz. "I've definitely been fortunate in my career to be put on some lines with quite a few skilled players. I've always just tried to keep my game simple, play in straight lines and go to the areas on the ice where I need to. The sooner I realized that, the more success I had."
This season, it's all come together at a whole new level at the age of 33. Their current point-a-game production spread out over 82 games would net them 112 points.
Just don't tell them that.
"I try not to think about it too much," Kunitz said of their magical season. "But one of my teammates told me the other day that even if I don't get another point this year I'd still have a better point ratio than at any other point in my career. Obviously things are going good. I've never been a big point-driven guy. But I have to keep going with it, keep putting pucks on the net. It's amazing though how easy Sid makes it for us."
This week I thought I'd pull together another installment of our Stonesoup vegetable spotlight.
Last time it was all about kale, today we're talking aubergine, which in Australia goes by the much less exotic name ‘eggplant'.
Before we get to today's recipe suggestions, I thought we'd better ask the big eggplant question…
To salt or not to salt?
One of the intimidating things about cooking eggplant is when recipes call for salting the eggplant before cooking. They often talk about salting to ‘remove the bitter flavours' but in my experience, modern eggplants aren't really bitter. So I tend not to bother with salting.
That being said, salting the eggplant can help minimise the amount of oil it absorbs when you're pan frying it. Again, I tend not to bother, but it's up to you…
6 Healthy Recipe Ideas for Aubergine (Eggplant)
1. Tomato Baked Eggplant
This has to be the easiest way to cook eggplant. I usually just serve it as is for a healthy vegetable focused meal but you could mash it up and use as a sauce for pasta.
2. Spiced Baked Eggplant
Eggplant loves spices! See the recipe below.
3. Grilled Baby Eggplant
My favourite way to cook those finger-shaped Japanese eggplant is to halve and grill on the BBQ. Sometimes I do them on their own, but I often cook them with other late Summer veg like red capsicum (bell peppers) and zucchini (courgettes). Wonderful served with hummus or this walnut and white bean puree.
If you can't get your hands on baby eggplant, slice regular eggplant and use them instead.
4. Soup
My favourite eggplant soup is this White Bean & Eggplant Soup. It's not the most beautiful creation but is deeply satisfying and well worth the effort.
5. Dip / Spread
No collection of eggplant recipes would be complete without the fabulous Lebanese dip / spread called babaganoush. Charring the eggplant can get a bit messy but it's totally worth it for the intensely smoky flavour.
6. Eggplant ‘Steaks'
The rich silky texture of cooked eggplant make for a fabulous vegetarian alternative to regular steaks. Especially good served with these parmesan peas.

Spiced Eggplant with Yoghurt & Quinoa
This dish was inspired by Yotam Ottolenghi in their fabulous book, Jerusalem. Well worth a read!
It's up to you whether you eat the eggplant skins or just scoop out the tasty flesh. I like to eat it all but my Irishman prefers to leave their skins behind.
Enough for 2
2 large eggplant (aubergine)
2 teaspoons ground coriander
150g (5oz) quinoa
1 bunch flat leaf parsley, leaves picked
6-8 tablespoons natural yoghurt
large handful pine nuts, toasted
1. Preheat oven to 200C (400F). Halve eggplant lengthwise then score the cut side by cutting in a chunky criss cross pattern. Place cut side up on a baking tray. Drizzle generously with olive oil and scatter over the ground coriander and a little salt and pepper.
2. Bake eggplant for 40 minutes or until very tender.
3. While the eggplant is cooking, bring a pot of water to the boil. Rinse quinoa and add to the boiling water. Simmer for 12-15 minutes until quinoa is just tender. Drain and toss with the parsley leaves.
4. When the eggplant is cooked, scatter over the quinoa parsley mixture. Drizzle with yoghurt and finish off with the pine nuts.
VARIATIONS
different spices – ground cumin, baharat, smoked paprika or a combo all work well with eggplant.
vegan / dairy-free – make a tahini sauce to replace the yoghurt by combining equal quantities of tahini, lemon juice and water.
carnivore – brown some ground (minced) lamb or beef in a pan and scatter over the quinoa.
nut-free – just skip the pine nuts or replace with some finely chopped red onion or red capsicum (bell pepper) for colour and crunch.
With love,

Words, when deployed in relation to the vagina, are always more than "just words". Because of the subtlety of the mind-body connection, words about the vagina are also what philosopher John Austin, in their 1960 book How to Do Things with Words, calls "performative utterances", often used as a means of social control. A "performative utterance" is a word or phrase that actually accomplishes something in the real world. When a judge says "Guilty" to a defendant, or a groom says "I do", the words alter material reality.
Studies have shown that verbal threats or verbal admiration or reassurances can directly affect the sexual functioning of the vagina. One suggests that a stressful environment can negatively affect vaginal tissue itself. This "bad stress" can also, as it supports or inhibits orgasm, either raise or lower the levels of women's confidence, creativity and hopefulness overall. Women react strongly to male verbal abuse of their vaginas or to implied threats of rape, even when these are "just jokes", for these very reasons – though most of us are unaware of the science behind our gut reaction that this kind of abuse is bad for us.
Comedienne Roseanne Barr described male TV writers' behaviour when women made inroads into their profession: they noted that they hated going up to the writers' house because there would be a "stinky-pussy" joke within three minutes. When a woman faces a workplace in which their male peers want to show them they are unwelcome, similar words or images targeting or insulting the vagina will often surface: centrefolds with legs spread, for instance, and the face of the woman in question superimposed on the naked body, will appear in public.
Of course cultural and psychological motivations play a part in this form of harassment. But the role of manipulating female stress in targeting the vagina should not be ignored.
These acts are often impersonal and tactical – strategies for directing a kind of pressure at women that is not consciously understood, but may be widely intuited, and even survive in folk memory, as eliciting a wider neuropsychological "bad stress" response that actually debilitates women.
In 2010, male Yale students gathered at a "Take Back the Night" event, where their female classmates were marching in a group, protesting against sexual assault. The young men chanted at the protesters: "No means yes and yes means anal." Some of the young women brought a lawsuit against the university, arguing that tolerating such behaviour created an unequal educational environment. Ethically, they are in the right, and neurobiologically, they are right as well. Almost all young women who face a group of their male peers chanting such slogans are likely to feel instinctively slightly panicked. On some level they are getting the message that they may be in the presence of would-be rapists, making it impossible to shrug off immature comments, as women are often asked to do.
Sexually threatening stress releases cortisol into the bloodstream, which has been connected to abdominal fat in women, with its attendant risks of diabetes and cardiac problems; it also raises the likelihood of heart disease and stroke. If you sexually stress a woman enough, over time, other parts of their life are likely to go awry; they will have difficulty relaxing in bed, as well as in the classroom or in the office. This in turn will inhibit the dopamine boost they might otherwise receive, which would in turn prevent the release of the chemicals in their brain that otherwise would make them confident, creative, hopeful, focused – and effective, especially relevant if they are competing academically or professionally with you. With this dynamic in mind, the phrase "fuck their up" takes on new meaning.
I experienced firsthand the powerful impact that the words used to communicate about the vagina can have on the female brain. This book had just been signed by a publisher, and I was euphoric, in creative terms, about the research and writing ahead.
At the same time, I was anxious about grappling with such a strong social taboo. At that point, a friend of a friend – an impresario whom I will call Alan, who has a complicated sense of humour and enjoys creating social spectacles that heighten tension – said they wanted to throw a party celebrating my book deal. The party became a topic of conversation among their friends, often with a ripple of amusement – with something oblique in it – as an undercurrent.
Alan told me that they were going to do a pasta party at which guests could make vagina-shaped pasta. I thought that was a funny and sort of charming idea, possibly a tribute to the subject matter, or, at the very least, not awful, though it was not a thematic twist I would have chosen myself.
When I arrived at the party, though, there was a slightly ominous, mischievous stir at the far end of the loft where the kitchen was located. Alan was in the kitchen, surrounded by a crowd of guests. I made my way there, with some trepidation. As I walked toward Alan, I passed the table where the pasta maker had been assembled. A group of people stood around it – fashioning, indeed, little handmade vulvas. The objects were rather sweet looking: like the real thing, the little pasta sculptures varied – each person's experience (or body, perhaps) informing their or their interpretation. There was an energy of respect and even would-be celebration from that table, from both the men and the women. So the platter of pasta resting on the table seemed to me to be assembled with a kind of love: flowery or feathery, fluted or fanned, each small sculpture was detailed and distinct: lovely little white objects against a hand-painted blue Italian ceramic tray.
Alan appeared at my side. "I call those 'cuntini'," they said, laughing, and my heart contracted. A flash of tension crossed the faces of many of the women present. The men's faces, which had been so open, and some so tender, became impassive. Something sweet and new, that had barely begun, was already closing down.
I heard a sizzling sound. I looked to the kitchen: the sound was coming from several dozen enormous sausages, ranged in iron skillets on the big industrial stove. I got it: ha, sausages, to go with the "cuntini". I noticed that the energy of the mixed-gender crowd was now not simple. The room had become more tense – the tension that I was familiar with by now, as I was recognising those moments when women feel demeaned but are expected to "go with it" and have a "sense of humour". My heart contracted further.
Finally, someone called my attention to the final featured item on the evening's menu. On the back burners of the stove, several immense salmon fillets were arranged on another platter. Again: I got it. I got the joke. Women are smelly. Fish-smelling. I flushed, with a kind of despair that was certainly psychological – depression that a friend would think this was funny – but which also felt physical.
But that was not what was really interesting to me about that night. I can deal with a misfired joke, if that was all that the event entailed. What is really interesting to me is that after the "cuntini" party, I could not type a word of the book – not even research notes – for six months, and I had never before suffered from writer's block. I felt – on both a creative and a physical level – that I had been punished for "going somewhere" that women are not supposed to go.

QUARRYVILLE, Pa. – Adios 16 oz. iced tea, hello tiny Gatorade G2.
So long delicious Original Rice Krispies Treats, make room for your brown rice brother.
A new round of federal school food restrictions are forcing districts across the country to ditch popular and profitable school snacks in exchange for “healthier” options recommended by First Lady Michelle Obama.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's “Smart Snack” rules – the latest aspect of the school food overhaul imposed through the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 – took effect July 1, and school officials are scrambling to comply with the new restrictions on calories, sodium, fat, sugar and other nutritional qualities of school a la carte items and vending machine fare.
The school food changes are the First Lady's pet project, which they contend is a concerted effort to crack down on childhood obesity. But school food directors in Pennsylvania are raising a number of concerns, from significant lost revenue to added work necessary to comply with the overbearing regulations.
“I'm just overwhelmed with all of the things we have to do,” Lampeter-Strasburg School District Food Service Director Anna Donato told Lancaster Online.
At Solanco High School, M&M cookies are now whole grain rich, and bags of Frito-Lay Sun Chips have been downsized and mixed with pretzels to comply with the sodium limit. School officials were also forced to stop selling 1% chocolate milk and replace it with a fat-free variety half the size, according to the news site.
Before the new rules, the district sold 100 bottles per day.
Solanco Food Service Director Matt Kirchoff is worried about what the changes will mean for cafeteria revenue, but said they haven't noticed a decline … yet.
“We don't get too down about it,” they told Lancaster Online.
Other area school officials contend the federal regulations are costing schools far more than they should, and have opted to forfeit as much as $150,000 in federal funding to preserve autonomy over what students are served.
Manheim Central and Manheim Township schools both recently decided to ditch the National School Lunch Program for high schools over concerns about declining lunch sales, and meeting the nutritional needs of a diverse student body – particularly student athletes – under “one-size-fits-all” rules.
“If we are unable to serve some students extras I predict they will pack and not enter the cafeteria lines,” Manheim Central Food Service Director David Ludwig wrote in an email to Lancaster Online. “Our students all have different needs. For this reason variety is needed.”
Ludwig also raised issue with the potential for lost sales, pointing out that French fries alone bring in $16,476 per year but would be banned under the new rules.
Food Services Director Gavin Scalyer said Manheim Township opted out in part because the rules just don't jibe with how the district does lunch.
“He said the school offers more than 10 ‘restaurant-quality salads,' which student purchase as entrees. Since they are classified as a la cartes, … some of the salads wouldn't meet calorie restrictions designed to apply to side items,” the news site reports.
The problems in Pennsylvania are only the latest to make headlines since the lunch overhaul took effect in 2012. Over 1 million students have stopped eating school lunch. The new rules also require all students to take a heaping helping of fruits and vegetables, which created over $1 billion in food waste as most students toss their greens in the garbage, according to reports.
Just last week, several New York school districts, and Illinois' second largest school district, decided to dump the National School Lunch Program. More schools are expected to follow their example.
You're kidding me…40,000 miles? It seemed like I hit 10,000 only yesterday. If you told me when I bought my 650r three years ago that I would ride 15,000 miles a year, I would have called you crazy. But here I am, and maybe I'm the crazy one.
watch in HD If you don't feel like reading, I've summarized some of my thoughts into a video:
Over the years, throughout the videos and write ups I've discussed a lot of topics, but it occurred to me that I missed a fundamental subject…my Ninja 650r! At first I kept putting it off thinking that I hadn't put enough miles on to get a proper appreciation of the machine. At this point I don't know how much more I can appreciate my 650r. In fact, let's crunch some numbers to get an idea of the sheer time spent with my 650r:
Total Miles = 40,000
Average MPG = 50
Average Speed = 50MPH
Actual Time Riding = Total Miles / Average Speed
Actual Time Riding = 800 Hours = 33 Days
My ass has been in the saddle for a total of 33 days…what?!?
Number of Gas Stops = Total Miles / Average MPG / Average Amount of Gas Used Per Tank
Number of Gas Stops = 40,000 / 50 / 3.1 = 258 I bought my brand new Kawasaki Ninja 650r in March of 2006. It was my first motorcycle. After three years and 40,000 miles I'm still loving my 650r. There are a lot of motorcycle reviews out there, but most of them take the bikes out for an afternoon, weekend or at most, a week before writing about them. Hardly seems enough time to get to really know a motorcycle. I have spent a month on my motorcycle in the past three years…literally. Over 800 hours of time in the saddle. So I would like to take some time to talk about the 2006 Kawasaki's Ninja 650r.
Know the Rider, Then Know the Ride.
I can never trust any word about a motorcycle until I have some idea about the motorcyclist. So I feel like I should say something about myself first. Riding style, experience, knowledge and enthusiasm play the biggest parts in my estimation of a fellow rider. My riding style varies depending on where and when I'm riding. I commute daily and tour often. Fast sweepers are fun at times, but I like the switchbacks and tight corners best. The Ninja 650r is the first motorcycle I've owned ( was a bit of a squid when I started). I've been riding for 3 years and over 40,000 miles. I practice motorcycle handling techniques often and read as much as I can about the subject. As for enthusiasm, several friends have expressed concern over my “hobby” which has consumed my life. So yea, I like motorcycles.
Enough about me, let's talk about the 650r!
Torquey and Nimble.
I really feel like I have been spoiled with how nimble the 650r is. I ride other bikes and I never realized how slow and cumbersome they can really be. The 650r just falls into the corners. It will leap into them if you want to. The amount of input needed on the bars is so slight that you think the bike just knows where you want to go. If for some reason I won a free Hayabusa or a ZX-10 the first thing I would do is sell it and buy a bike half the size. Smaller bikes are more fun. The 650r gives you enough power not be bored and not too much to get yourself into too much trouble very easily.
The engine has a lot of torque between 20mph and 60mph. It's power band is much lower than other bikes. I would rather have power in the lower ranges. For commuting and inner city riding you shouldn't be going over 60 very often unless you are a reckless rider. I'm going to try and keep talk about riding styles to a minimum, but it does play a factor when considering the characteristics of a motorcycle. It took me a while to get comfortable lifting the front wheel off the ground (on non-public roads of course), but once I did I found out how much power the 650r can really pump out. No need to pop the clutch, you can power wheelie from low speeds (around 20mph) very easily.
Sport Touring Capabilities
Honestly, when I bought the 650r, I didn't know what the term “sport touring” even meant. All that mattered to me was that I was comfortable when sitting on the bike and with the relaxed and non-aggressive seating stance it fits like a glove. I can lean completely forward and tuck in behind the windscreen, or sit completely upright and still have a hand on the bars. I lowered my bars and I can still reach.
Hauling luggage is an easy task if you've got the right gear. I have been using soft luggage all these years. I use a Rev Pack Tour Pack for bulky stuff and long trips. Otherwise I stick to using the lighter and smaller Cortech Sport Tail bag or Saddle Bags. I had no problem finding storage solutions even for a two week trip.
Mechanical Problems
I've had two major problems with my 650r. My head gasket blew and I was leaking oil. Also the oil pump had a leak as well. Luckily I caught these things early since I inspect my bike often. My mechanic said I couldn't have done any preventative maintenance to avoid this. It just happens sometimes. The oil leak problem occurred at 32,000 miles, about 2 years into the bike's life. The second major problem I had was the stator going bad at 39,000 miles. When I heard this I thought, what the heck is a stator? The stator is a collection of copper wires in which the magnets spin inside of and in effect produce electricity.
So those are the only two major problems I have had. Something had to go wrong eventually, and I'm happy I went as long as I did. I've gotten sick of trips to the shop and now I've got myself a service manual and am I getting my hands dirty by doing the work myself.
Maintenance Log
You have heard me tout the merits of keeping a proper maintenance log in the past. So I might as well show you mine so you can get an idea of all that goes into keeping the Ninja 650r running. It may look like a lot all in one list, but it's really basic stuff for the most part.
Modifications
Throttlemiester throttle lock
Lower handlebars: Wanted a more aggressive stance. At this point I might like the stock bars better because they are geared towards touring.
IPod Mount: Gotta have my music
Electrical Outlet: Essential to keep all my gadgets going while in the middle of nowhere.
Gerbing Heated Liner Wiring Harness
Tank protector
Frame sliders: Saved my fairings from getting all scuffed up 3 times. They've paid for themselves.
Fender eliminator: Just cosmetic thing.
Garmin GPS Map 60CSx handlebar mount (Ram-mount)
Custom camera mount installed on swingarm spool
In Conclusion…
Motorcycling has changed my life forever. Perhaps there's another bike out there that could have filled the 650r's tires…who knows. What I do know is how much this motorcycle means to me. I've grown attached to this collection of steel, plastic and rubber. I know when she's running a little off, and they tell me when I'm a little off myself. It's strange to consider, but unmistakable for me to acknowledge.
Here's to my first 40,000, and hoping for another 40,000.
The Anaheim Ducks received some bad news on the blue line on Thursday night.
General manager Bob Murray announced that defenceman Cam Fowler is expected to miss anywhere from two to six weeks after suffering a lower-body injury during Tuesday's game against the Calgary Flames.
Fowler went down after a knee-on-knee collision with Flames defenceman Mark Giordano and looked to be in significant pain as they were helped off the ice.
Though not as severe as first thought, the loss of Fowler will certainly be felt by the Ducks, who are currently hanging on to first place in the Pacific with 101 points going into Thursday's game against the Chicago Blackhawks. The 25-year-old leads all Anaheim defencemen in ice time and is a significant part of the club's special teams.
The knee-on-knee incident brewed up more bad blood between the Pacific Division rivals—and potential first round playoff opponents—and sparked some debate about the nature of the hit.
“I think our legs collided,” Giordano told reporters after the game. “I hope he's OK. You don't like to see guys get hurt. There was no intent to hurt them there.”
A woman kills themselves to stop the pain of an illness they tried to alleviate with marijuana:
They were a high-profile campaigner for the Montana Medical Marijuana Act, and like others, they were dismayed when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that drug agents could still arrest sick people using marijuana, even in states that legalized its use. The ruling came to haunt Prosser in late March, when DEA agents seized less than a half ounce of marijuana sent to them by their registered caregiver in Flathead County. At the time, the DEA special agent in charge of the Rocky Mountain Field Division said federal agents were “protecting people from their own state laws” by seizing such shipments.
That DEA statement should go down in history as an emblem of the anti-federalist agenda of today's conservatives. It's up there with protecting people from the alleviation of their own pain. Prosser couldn't get the medicine they needed, except from unreliable and sometimes dangerous sources. Unable to cope with the pain of their illness, they took their own life.
“Give me liberty or give me death,” they wrote in July.
That's the American spirit. The government deprived them of liberty and so they chose death. May they and every other victim of the drug war rest in peace.
(Update: here's Obama on the question. He'd pull the feds off persecuting the sick in states where medical marijuana is legal.)

Worries about Disney turning our beloved Star Wars into a kiddie pool of lightsaber battles and fairy tale princesses have been thwarted by an honest to goodness war film that hinges on the perfection of The Empire Strikes Back.
After JJ Abrams release of The Force Awakens, fans were split. Some loved its awesome way of retelling the classic A New Hope story with a reinvigorated spin for a new generation of fans. Others wallowed in the way the film played it too safely. This fan is of the notion that Abrams did what they could to try and satisfy a wide audience while giving Star Wars some of its luster back after the minor plot and acting failures of the Lucas prequel trilogy.
I'm here to tell you that Gareth Edwards delivers a succinct vision with their new semi-prequel, Rogue One. This is an adrenaline infused Star Wars adventure that relies on sheer brilliance at many turns that brings back the light humor, stunning space battles, and the character development that we got with the original three films. And honestly, it's a hard thing to say, but this is the most hardcore entry behind The Empire Strikes Back. Rogue One is a vintage World War II movie dressed up as a science fiction action piece with majestic scenery, interplanetary warfare, and a rogue band of Rebellion misfits hell bent on saving the galaxy from the evils of the Death Star. By now you've heard the comparisons to The Dirty Dozen. That's the closest non sci fi representation I can personally find. Using a mixed band of characters with differing backgrounds and skill sets, this is Star Wars dosed with a pinch of Guardians of the Galaxy (which was in turn obviously influenced by SW).
There's something special about this Star Wars film that The Force Awakens didn't offer. Don't misread this. I have a deep love and admiration for TFA. However, this rendering of the universe gives us new characters that have nothing to do with the Skywalker legacy, making this the first in the series that breaks from tradition. It actually feels refreshing, freeing and gives audience members something different to latch on to finally. Edwards and their crew of obvious fans do a bang up job creating great action sequences that have weight and depth, and are reminiscent of what we got in the first three SW adventures. Old vehicles are brought back for nostalgia's sake while newer ships are introduced regularly. Unlike The Force Awakens, the fan service here moves the story forward and progresses our gritty group of military have-nots towards a conclusion so perfect I couldn't even believe my eyes.
There are actual stakes here that haven't been felt before. The battles are brutal. The deaths have emotional impact and characters we learn to love are dispatched like flies. Edwards takes everything we've seen before in the franchise and stirs the pot just enough to make it interesting as they make the best non-Lucas Star Wars movie we've seen yet. Not to belittle TFA, but this is a heavy step forward from Abrams reliance on a safety net. Gareth Edwards learns from the mistakes of their Godzilla feature (which didn't have enough of the creature in it) and throws so much vintage Star Wars at the screen, fans will be hard pressed not to enjoy the hell out of this.
Hey Rey. There's a new bad ass chick in town.
Some audience members may take note that the classic musical themes and the opening crawl are missing from Rogue One which feels a tad unnatural and a bit strange. By the time you really notice, you're thrown into a Star Wars film so worthy, you'll walk out of the theater in absolute awe. George Lucas once said that the initial trilogy had the dirty and battle worn look of a "used future". This is a stunning remnant worthy of what Lucas, Kershner, and Marquand created with the first trilogy. If you're a Star Wars fan and you don't love this movie, I'll be totally shocked.
With marvelous casting choices, streamlined set design, a penchant for effects that are ripped from the same page as the practical world of the original 1977 cinematic release, and a hard set war tone that feels relevant to the modern day scourge in the middle east, Rogue One delivers on every front. I cannot say enough good things about Edwards' release.

Survey shows 36m trees have died since May, as record low snowpack and warm temperatures leave trees thirsty and prone to beetle infestation
California drought: 36m trees dead since May, raising toll to more than 102m
The California drought has killed more than 102m trees in a die-off of forests that increases the risk of catastrophic wildfires and other threats to humans, officials said on Friday.
The latest aerial survey by the US Forest Service shows there are 36m more dead trees since May in the state and there has been a 100% increase since 2015.
An American tragedy: why are millions of trees dying across the country? Read more
“These dead and dying trees continue to elevate the risk of wildfire, complicate our efforts to respond safely and effectively to fires when they do occur and pose a host of threats to life and property,” the US agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, said in a statement.
California has endured five years of drought marked by a record low mountain snowpack and warm temperatures. The drought has left trees thirsty and prone to infestation by bark beetles.
Late last year, Governor Jerry Brown formed a taskforce charged with finding ways to remove the trees that threaten motorists and communities.
Vilsack called on Congress to act, saying more federal funding goes toward fighting fires than forestry management, such as removing dead trees to improve forests' health.
Officials are pushing to turn more trees into lumber, burn them in energy plants or dispose of them in incinerators to eliminate them as fuel for wildfires.
Some environmentalists argue, however, that a die-off is part of a healthy forest's life-cycle. They favor leaving the trees that need to be cut down on the forest floor to decompose and serve as wildlife habitat.

Most dead trees are in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, officials say. However, they are also beginning to find dead trees in northern California counties such as Siskiyou, Modoc, Plumas and Lassen.
More trees are expected to die into 2017, US Forest Service officials say.
People assume the tally amounts to too many dead trees, but fire suppression has created unnaturally green forests with far too little wildfire and dead trees, said Chad Hanson, a forest ecologist at Earth Island Institute's John Muir Project.
“We don't want too much and we don't want too little,” they said. “This is not too much.”
Should people be allowed to keep exotic animals as pets? Should we ban the ownership of wild animals? Do true animal lovers keep exotic pets? Check out the pros and cons and share your opinion!
On netivist we have many open debates and petitions concerning animal abuse and protection (e.g. bullfighting, dolphin hunting, gorillas in zoos). Let's discuss the possession of exotic pets. Keeping exotic animals as pets has always been a subject of controversy. We are not only referring to the eccentricities of some celebrity owning a lion or a tiger. Exotic pets are very diverse and increasingly common in homes.
Should exotic animals be kept as pets?
Animal lovers are divided. For some of them having an exotic pet is a cool thing and a display of love for the animal. Some owners of unusual pets put great effort into all the paperwork necessary to get their animals authorized as pets. Moreover, they spend a lot of money and time taking care of their pets. Owning a pet is always a responsibility, but owning a dangerous or wild animal more so. For others, allowing exotic pets means endangering wildlife. Snakes, spiders, chameleons, scorpions and monkeys have become increasingly common pets. The owners of these pets in generally treat them with great care and argue these pets have a very pleasant life at their homes. However, the ownership of exotic pets is also highly controversial. Keeping exotic animals as pets threatens public health and safety as well as animal welfare. Wild animals can harm humans and spread diseases.
Pros and cons of exotic pets
Let's have a look at the arguments proposed by people in favor of exotic pets ownership:
Many of these pets don't need neither much space , nor daily walks or shows of affection , for example reptiles, spiders, insects…

Many activists and animal rights advocates staunchly oppose keeping exotic animal as pets and argue:
Exotic animals are wild animals. They have not been domesticated and selected during thousands of years like dogs (30.000 years) and cats (5.000 years). So even if they are owned since birth and tamed, they are still wild, with their own instincts and needs . In consequence, they often suffer while being kept as pets

Sen. Ted Cruz Heads Into Arizona Primary Backed By House Conservative
Arizona Rep. David Schweikert threw their support behind Sen. Ted Cruz last week, calling them a "principled leader." Schweikert is a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
And Republican Congressman Dave Schweikert of Arizona is in our studios here in Washington. Once again, member of congress, good morning.
DAVID SCHWEIKERT: Good morning.
INSKEEP: What do you think of what you've just heard?
SCHWEIKERT: A, heartbreaking - B, we're going to have a honest conversation of rethinking the threat levels from a lone wolf because...
INSKEEP: This isn't a lone wolf. That's what you're saying?
SCHWEIKERT: Yeah, I mean, repeatedly these appear to be coordinated attacks. And it's going to - we're really going to have to look at our modeling.
INSKEEP: Is this making you think differently about security in the United States then?
SCHWEIKERT: My greater fear, it's - when something like that - this is so devastating. And you try to process and understand it, it - the cascade effect - everything from our politics to how we do security and are we truly finding the most effective way to keep our population safe? And, you know, there's still facts to be gained.
INSKEEP: Now, this event takes place, of course, in the middle of a presidential campaign, which is why we invited you on the program this morning because your state, Arizona, is one of two voting today for presidential candidates.
SCHWEIKERT: Yes.
INSKEEP: And you've endorsed Ted Cruz on the Republican side. Are you for Ted Cruz or against Donald Trump?
SCHWEIKERT: Well, a little bit of both, actually - but I have the uniqueness of, you know, being in the House. I've actually worked with Senator Cruz on some pretty complex pieces of legislation. And in that case, I know them to be just stunningly bright. So that's what drove my endorsement. Arizona's a unique state from the standpoint that we have a vote-through-mail-predominant system. So the candidates all showed up this last weekend. Yet, the reality - probably about 60 percent of the votes were already in the mail.
INSKEEP: You mailed yours in some time back?
SCHWEIKERT: Oh, yeah, probably two and a half weeks ago.
INSKEEP: So let me ask you a question. We had a supporter of Donald Trump on the program yesterday, Roger Stone. And our question for them was, how can this guy win a general election when 64 percent of Americans say they do not approve of Donald Trump? The same question can be asked about Ted Cruz, though. How can this man, who is very conservative and who is a certain kind of candidate, win a general election?
SCHWEIKERT: You know, it's a great question. What ends up happening is, if we want to move on to the polling, you start to model what's the nature of the negatives. And we're obviously heading towards the general election, where both the presumptive Democrat nominee and whoever the Republican nominee are going to be upside down in their negatives. So now...
INSKEEP: Hillary Clinton is about 50 percent in that department now.
SCHWEIKERT: Yeah. And this will be unique because it's going to be an election of the least of disdain for many of the voters. So you - and I don't mean to get geeky on this. But you start to break it up. What is the nature of my dislike? Do I dislike this person because they're not warm and fuzzy or because I find them appalling on a certain issue? And, you know, that's still to be understood.
INSKEEP: Well, that raises a question - in about 20 seconds that we have - then. Can Ted Cruz, who has said, I'm very conservative and you can trust me. I'm going to do what I say I'm going to do. I'm going to follow some very precise policies. I'm very hard-line on many different policies. Can they expand the Republican base? Can they expand the tent?
SCHWEIKERT: Look, we go through this almost - at the end of almost every cantankerous primary season. And we don't have a choice, do we? At some point, you're going to have to reach out and, if you're that nominee, listen to a variety of different voices.
INSKEEP: OK. Congressman, thanks so much.
SCHWEIKERT: I appreciate you having me.
INSKEEP: Dave Schweikert is a Republican member of congress from Arizona, talking with us on this morning that Utah and Arizona both vote for presidential candidates.

Ben Stiller is talking for the first time about being diagnosed with prostate cancer at 48. Stiller, now 50, visited the Stern Show on Tuesday morning and told Howard how they and their doctor were able to detect and treat the disease early.
"It came out of the blue for me," Ben told Howard. "I had no idea." Had they not gotten tested by their doctor, Ben's cancer could have gone undetected. Luckily, they were given a PSA, or prostate-specific antigen test, in their 40s, despite most medical professionals suggesting that prostate cancer screening not begin until age 50.
"It's a very controversial subject, the PSA test," Ben said. "The PSA test is the only early screener for prostate cancer and, right now, the United States Preventative Services Task Force does not recommend taking the test. I think American Cancer Society says you should discuss it at 50. If I hadn't taken the test - my doctor started giving it to me at 46 - I would not have known. Right now, I still wouldn't have known."
When their PSA test came back with higher than normal levels, Ben was then given an MRI followed by a biopsy. After being diagnosed with prostate cancer, Ben explained one of the first things they did was search the internet to learn about others who have had prostate cancer, including their former co-star Robert De Niro.
"I called them right away," Ben told Howard. "He hooked me up with their doctor." After talking to several specialists, Ben was introduced to Dr. Ted Schaeffer, the chair of Northwestern University's Department of Urology, who has performed some 2,000 surgeries in their career.
"I felt comfortable with Ted," Ben said. "You want to go to a surgeon that you feel is going to get rid of the cancer first and preserve everything." On the morning of their operation, however, Ben admitted to being scared, calling it a "frightening" experience. Howard wondered if Ben was at all scared about losing their sexual function and if they had sex, possibly for the last time, the night before their surgery.
"My wife was kind enough," Ben said with a laugh. Post-surgery, sex has changed for Stiller. They and their doctor explained what men can expect after undergoing a procedure that removes the prostate.
"It takes time to come back," Ben said. "It changes the experience of what an orgasm feels like. It's great, it just feels different."
"The prostate makes the semen," Dr. Ted said. "You can totally have an erection and everything you're thinking and feeling during sex is the same because that's up in your brain."
After a successful surgery, Ben was given another PSA test which came back clean. Three months after the operation, a second test showed that the cancer was officially gone. Ben told Howard that they saved the Tweety Bird band-aid from their final blood test to remind them of how grateful they were to get that good news.
"It just gives you an appreciation for everything in life and all the other bullshit doesn't matter," Ben said. Now, their goal is to get the word out about PSA tests and how important it is for men to get one, even if they're not yet 50.
"It's part of who I am now," Ben said. "This thing saved my life, I gotta say something."

How To Be An Effective Manager
Jose Bautista Blocked Unblock Follow May 16, 2017
The success of any business depends heavily on the effectiveness of its managers. They can have a significant impact on business outcomes and employee engagement. But many organizations do not adequately select or develop their managers, and they miss a great opportunity for business advancement.

How to become an effective manager?
1- Empower your team
Effective managers empower their teams by giving them opportunities to stretch and grow in four ways. These managers:
Do not micromanage.
Coach their team to help them achieve their own goals.
Make it clear they trust their team.
Advocate for the team in the wider organization.
2- Care professionally and personally for your team
Effective managers show care for their teams not only professionally, but personally as well.
Professionally . Managers can develop their teams by offering feedback, identifying opportunities for growth, and focusing on skill development.
. Managers can develop their teams by offering feedback, identifying opportunities for growth, and focusing on skill development. Personally. Managers need to show and communicate their care back to employees. Having empathy and developing emotional intelligence can be very helpful.
3- Be result oriented
Effective managers focus on empowering their teams to deliver concrete results. They combine a focus on urgency with an understanding of what results will have the most impact. In order to deliver results and support their team's productivity, here are some actions that effective managers demonstrate:
Keep the team focused on results.
Help the team prioritize.
Remove roadblocks.
Make clear about who owns what.
Are hard workers; set the pace for the team.
4- Be an advisor and coach your individual contributors
Many effective managers are credible advisors to their teams. These managers usually have deep expertise in their field of work which they can use to help team members come up with creative solutions. These managers often:
Roll up their sleeves and work alongside the team.
Understand the challenges of the work.
Help solve problems based on their technical knowledge and skills.
5- Set and communicate the vision
A vision is an important behavior of managers. A clear team vision is helpful for a number of reasons, in particular:
It's crucial to the success of a team.
Team members need to know where they're going.
It helps teams decide what to work on.
Once set, a manager also needs to be effective at communicating that vision to the team. It's important to encourage managers to be available for their teams and to encourage open dialogue and honest feedback, even when there's tough news.
6- Give feedback. Constantly.
Giving feedback is one of the most important and challenging responsibilities of a good manager. When giving feedback to their team members, it's important:
*****3.1 UPDATE*****
Spoiler
The build is just as viable as it was last league but has a few new options for items. The items I'm talking about are Lightpoacher, abyss jewels and some elder/shaper mods. I haven't tested the build with Lightpoacher but I don't see a reason not to use it, it should clear up stranglers nicely. You can still get cooldown recovery from belt and boots but I'd say Inya's is still best for the boots slot with the insane power charge generation. In regards to vaal pact, I think the build functions just fine without it, vaal pact mostly helped with reflect and was way too op and 1 point away on the tree for us but after running a few maps on my char from last league I didn't feel like its needed. Also, I think Assassin and Pathfinder combo for ascendancy choices is strictly better now due to reflect getting removed.
INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the update for our build "The New Fakener". In this thread I'll be going over all the changes, gear, passive tree and ascendancy. This variant of the build is made purely for farming maps and most likely not suitable for doing guardians/shaper.
If you want a build that deletes shaper take a look at my guildie's guide:

I picked Scion for the following reasons:
1. Assassin's "Deadly Infusion" nerf makes the crit too inconsistent
2. The Assassin node in Ascendant's tree provides base crit chance which solves the problem listed
above.
3. The Elementalist node makes us pretty much immune to reflect along with "Soul of Yugul" in the pantheon system
4. Extra Skill points allow us to grab more life around the tree as this build starves for points
5. Added pathfinder as an option instead of Elementalist, personally I prefer Elementalist but Pathfinder provides more comfortable flask sustain.(If going pathfinder take the pathfinder node in merciless lab and go path of the shadow instead path of the witch)

REQUIRED GEAR
Spoiler
The good ol' protector as always
Cospri's Malice 100% needed, build doesn't work without it
Elreon rings needed to sustain shield charge and cyclone, need atleast 2x -7
Lycosidae is a must-have, frees up gem slots and passives as we don't need to worry about accuracy.
Vinktar is our main source of leech.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED GEAR
**NOTE: If your gear is not good enough to cap res use rare gloves with attack speed, rare belt and/or rare helmet**
Spoiler
Voll's Devotion is BIS for damage although when clearing I often use Bisco's and swap in Voll's for single target.
With these boots we no longer need Blade Vortex in our 6-link and are pretty much always topped up when it comes to power charges.
Gloves crafted with Essence of Insanity, this boosts our shield charge speed by a ton.
Starkonja's with a shield charge attack speed in highly recommended for the helmet slot, all of it's stats are super useful to us.
I think this belt is BiS as it provides a lot of speed and it's also noticable on single target, if you're playing HC you might want to use a rare leather belt with high life.
Once you have good gear and can reliably one-shot packs, cap res and have a decent life pool you might want to consider using a Bisco's Collar to boost your loot drops.

First of all, we need a +2 manas gained on hit jewel to sustain cyclone if using a 6-link, alira regen seems to sustain our cyclone on a 5-link though.

1. Life
2. Crit multi
3. Attack speed
4. Resistances

After the Fed admitted over a year ago that the US unemployment rate (which in 2012 was supposed to be a rate hike "threshold" once it hit 6.5% and is now at 5.1%) has become irrelevant in a country where a record 94 million people have left the labor force, and with the Fed poised to hike rates even though US hourly wages have not only not increased for the past 7 years, but for the vast majority of the labor force continue to decline, some have asked - is there any labor-related chart that matters any more?
The answer: a resounding yes, only it is none of the conventional charts that algos and sometimes humans look at.
The one chart that matters more than ever,has little to nothing to do with the Fed's monetary policy, but everything to do with the November 2016 presidential elections in which the topic of immigration, both legal and illegal, is shaping up to be the most rancorous, contentious and divisive.
The chart is the following, showing the cumulative addition of foreign-born and native-born workers added to US payrolls according to the BLS since December 2007, i.e., since the start of the recession/Second Great Depression.
The chart is especially important because what it shows for just the month of August will be enough to provide the Trump - and every other - campaign with enough soundbites and pivot points to last it for weeks on end: namely, that in August a whopping 698,000 native-born Americans lost their job. This drop was offset by 204,000 foreign-born Americans, who got a job in the month of August.
But the punchline: since December 2007, according to the Household Survey, only 790,000 native born American jobs have been added. Contrast that with the 2.1 million foreign-born Americans who have found a job over the same time period...
... and you have a combustible mess that will lead to serious fireworks during the next GOP primary.
Hidden Hands: What Cyprus Was Really About Lee Jenkins
Cyprus is just part of a much larger contest being played out across the region.
Not without reason, much of the news coverage of Cyprus has focused on the financial implications of the debt stricken island. Some depositors face losing up to 60 percent of their savings. Two excellent articles on the subject can be found here and here.
But there are larger forces at play. Berlin, Brussels, Moscow and even London and Tel Aviv are locked in a good old fashioned game of power politics, with machinations and ambitions which are more reminiscent of the Great Powers in the 19th century.
A quick look at the map will show you why Cyprus matters, indeed, why it has always mattered.
Situated in the Eas tern Mediterranean, the island is almost equidistant between North Africa, the Levant and Turkey. It has been a crucial staging post for invasions, as well as an anchor for any power aiming to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean. The opening of the Suez Canal in the middle of the 19th Century gave the island added significance, and it was no surprise that Cyprus was swallowed into the British Empire not long after the Canal was complete. For European powers trading with the east, the Canal zone is critical, ergo Cyprus is critical.
For Russia, the Easter Mediterranean and Black Sea are its primary opening to the world's oceans. During the Cold War, Russia dominated the region; Egypt, Libya and Syria were Soviet client states, and this was backed up with a powerful fleet based in Ukraine. Today, however, the picture is very different. Gadaffi is gone, Egypt is pro-West (though that may change) and Syria is close to collapse. Granted, Russia has reinstated its permanent Mediterranean Fleet but it is no longer the dominant force it once was. This partly explains why Moscow was happy for its Oligarchs to buy up swathes of Cyprus, for where money accumulates, so does political influence. Russia was close to sewing up Cyprus as a quasi overseas dependency, like a Mediterranean Cuba.
As Mohamed A. El-Erian say; “A greater strategic role in Cyprus would compensate Russia for its diminishing influence in Syria, another Mediterranean access point. Meanwhile, its involvement in the development of Cypriot gas fields would give it an even greater say in the supply of energy to western Europe.”
For Israel, discoveries of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas deposits between it and Cyprus are a mixed blessing. On the one hand they offer the prospect of both energy security and even Israel becoming a net exporter of energy. On the other, such riches inevitably draw the attention of other regional powers into what had been a comparatively peaceful front for Israel; the sea. Israel needs to tread carefully; cooperation with Cyprus risks damaging still further relations with Turkey. Exporting to Europe would mean a stable market, but would require investment and a beefing up of Israeli naval assets, which would in turn provoke the ire of Russia and Egypt. Breaking into the European market would also aggravate Russia, which seeks to dominate the energy market in Europe as a way of compensating for its diminished influence in Eastern Europe.
Even though Britain granted Cyprus independence, it maintained 98 square miles of territory in the form of two huge military bases: Akrotiri and Dhekelia. These bases were used during the invasion of Iraq, and serve as an intelligence and supply base for British and American forces in the Middle East. Not only are they unsinkable aircraft carriers, they provide Britain with a comparatively cheap way of maintaining influence in a critical region without having to support a battle fleet. This is especially important now following the Arab Spring and the continuing carnage in Syria. The reappearance of Russia onto the scene underlines the significance of the bases.
Western powers want to have influence in Cyprus as a way to ensure the safety of strategic sea lanes at a time of growing radicalism and instability–especially regarding the growing number of Islamist governments–in the Middle East
This is partly where Brussels and Berlin come in (Berlin being the EU's enforcer in all but name). The aim of ever closer union demands that each member of the EU be sufficiently integrated into the European economy… preferably dependent on it. It is bad enough that half of Cyprus is occupied by Turkey, but having the other half effectively owned by Russians was simply unacceptable. If the EU wants to be a global economic, diplomatic and even military player in its own right, full control over Cyprus is critical. Not only would it guarantee a source of energy for the Bloc, it would provide a forward base for influence in North Africa and the Middle East. It would also act as a gatekeeper for Suez and subsequently trade passing too and from Asia. Put simply, Cyprus is too important to the EU's regional and global aspirations to be left to chance. Viewed this way, the economy of Cyprus has been sacrificed for a greater grand strategic goal.
Brussels may have actually achieved a geopolitical master stroke in Cyprus, at once crippling Russian gains, and making the island dependent on the central institutions of the EU.
The story is of course far from over. There is no guarantee the current deal will last, or that the leaders who agreed the deal will still be in place in a year. However by virtue of history, economics, geography and the eternal struggle between states, Cyprus will continue to be a geopolitical battlefield for decades to come.

Although producer and financier John Aglialoro let the cat out of the bag in early February, as readers of Reason 24/7 already knew, the Atlas Shrugged movie team made the official announcement today that, despite losing a reported over $20 million on the first two parts, they are going to finish telling the full Atlas saga in film form, as they wish to.
From their press release:
Today, Atlas Productions, LLC officially announced that “Atlas Shrugged Part 3”, the third and final installment of the Atlas Shrugged movie trilogy, has been officially greenlit with principal photography to begin later this year... Aglialoro's company produced and distributed Parts 1 and 2, and has set a USA theatrical release for Part 3 in the Summer of 2014. Parts 1 and 2 are now currently available on DVD and internet download. Producer Harmon Kaslow said, “Our number one goal with Part 3 is to pull the prescient message of Atlas off of the page and project it clearly onto the screen. Ayn Rand drew incredibly sharp archetypes with stark backdrops. Our goal with Part 3 is to bring these characters to life as accurately as possible and celebrate Rand's message.”
The first two films featured different casts and director, and no actors or director are yet announced for Part Three.
Hollywood Reporter on the announcement:
"The message of Atlas Shrugged is far greater than any particular political movement and our intention is to convey that message as clearly as possible," Kaslow tells The Hollywood Reporter. "We are ultimately confident that we're going to have absolutely no direct impact on the looters already entrenched in Washington. We are however equally confident that if we let Atlas speak for itself, we can have an impact on the voters that put them there." Production and marketing budgets for the first two films were between $10 million-$20 million apiece, and the third will be made and marketed for less than $10 million... As with the first two films, Part 3 will hit theaters at a politically advantageous time -- summer of 2014, just ahead of the midterm elections. Part 1 was released on April 15, tax day, 2011, and Part 2 opened in October, 2012, just ahead of the November presidential election.
Hostile jokers on the Internet who haven't bothered to read Rand and understand them as some sort of prophet of profit above all seem to find a snickering irony in these filmmakers following their muse. The entire point of their 1943 novel The Fountainhead was of the prime importance of the creative artist, who should and will do the work they want to do, whether or not the world rewards them for it. The Atlas film project, whatever your opinions of its merits, is in a very Randian spirit all the way.

Most characters I might use in the future roleplays probably have something to do with this world, but I can adapt most of them to a different lore/era easily.I am often perceived as a jackasswith a terrible sense of humour, which often contains quoting my favourite cartoons and video games, naming mighty god-like creatures very plain names, and getting angry over simple things.Being easily pissed off is apparently a trademark trait of mine, according to a lot of people, but even then I try to get some funny into my rants.I could probably rant about anything, and I probably have opinions about everything. I'm a loudmouth on the internet, but very anxious in real lifeMy hobbies include watching shitty movies, drawing shitty things, and having shitty opinions on tumblr.Also I study illustration.I personally tend to enjoy roleplays that aren't very epic in their plot, what I am usually interested in in just about any media of entertainment is characters.I like roleplays that force our characters to go way out of their comfort zone, I like it when they don't instantly know how to react.Taking a group of colourful characters and throwing them into some backwards, fucked up or weird situation without anyone knowing what the fuck is going on is my favourite type of roleplay.ANOTHER thing I absolutely love is taking a tired concept and doing a complete revamp of it, so maybe I'll try to work with that.Genre-wise i'm very adaptable, because I have a lot of characters that are also very adaptable. I love fantasy, but also sci-fi, horror and mystery, and supernatural, all kinds of things really.I am not usually a fan of fandom-based roleplays though, unless it's super opened to various possible storylines, like Pokémon or harry potter for example, but other than these two i can't think of any fandom i'd enjoy roleplaying

It's a situation that has played out all too often. North Korea detonates a nuclear bomb. Washington responds by calling for stronger sanctions. The trite repetitiveness of the exchange makes one question whether it even qualifies as “breaking news” any more.
But this time, things are different. North Korea's latest nuclear test on September 9 was reportedly more powerful than the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb. It also came with a chilling statement from the regime's state news agency , to the effect that the DPRK has successfully miniaturized a nuclear weapon into a missile warhead. If this is true, then Pyongyang has completed its long and tumultuous path to nuclear missile development.
To make matters worse, the North's nuclear test was preceded by two other worrying provocations. On August 24, the DPRK successfully launched a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) with a potential range of 1,000 kilometers, making it capable of striking South Korea, Japan, and American bases in the region. Just days later, on September 5, North Korea fired three new ground-based ballistic missiles (GBLMs) into the Sea of Japan – with at least one equipped with technology designed to penetrate missile defense systems like the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) that the U.S. plans to deploy in the region.
Together, these episodes represent a three-pronged demonstration of defiance from the DPRK. Yet, at least so far, they have elicited only a weak response from Washington and Seoul, which have merely called for more sanctions and pledged to redouble defense cooperation.
The growing threat from the North Korean regime suggests that the United States can no longer afford to continue the policy of “strategic patience” that has come to characterize the Obama administration's approach to the issue. Rather, Washington should respond with a three-part plan of its own – one designed not only to deter future North Korean aggression, but also to spur other regional states into action.
First, the U.S. should strengthen the trilateral military intelligence-sharing pact it signed with Japan and South Korea back in December of 2014. That agreement currently covers only North Korean missile activity; historic tensions between Seoul and Tokyo prevented the parties from signing a more comprehensive pact. But with Japan-ROK relations thawing and the North Korean threat increasing, the trilateral relationship is primed for greater interaction – and the 2014 accord is ripe for expansion.
Second, Washington should proactively seek to bolster South Korea defensive and offensive missile capabilities. With the deployment of THAAD in the near future, South Korea will possess an increasingly robust, multi-tiered missile defense. But given the sheer size of North Korea's arsenal and the significant advances it has made in missile technology to date, THAAD alone is not enough. In addition to strengthening South Korean defense, Washington should consult with Seoul about easing restrictions on the latter's offensive ballistic missile capabilities as a deterrent against DPRK aggression.
Currently, South Korea's ballistic missiles are limited to a range of 800 kilometers and a payload of 500 kilograms (with more weight permitted at shorter ranges). Considering that the majority of North Korean missile facilities are concentrated in the country's northern regions, these regulations may hamper South Korea's ability to neutralize a North Korean missile threat in the event of hostilities. Beefing up Seoul's offensive potential, then, would send a concrete signal to Pyongyang that the U.S. is committed both to South Korea's defense and to its victory if a conflict breaks out.
The third step is a highly controversial one: reopening negotiations with South Korea over the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons. After five progressively more powerful nuclear tests from its northern neighbor, Seoul has grown wary of the devolving situation on the peninsula. As a result, although South Korea remains a non-nuclear nation, many officials in the ruling Saenuri Party have called for the return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn by the Bush I administration in 1991, whereas others go as far as advocating that the country develop nuclear weapons of its own. For now, violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and thereby jeopardizing ties with Washington is not on Seoul's agenda. But without meaningful constraints on North Korea, the ROK may be further tempted to embark on an indigenous nuclear weapons program, with potentially destabilizing effects on the region. Preventing this possibility by reassuring South Korea should make the topic of tactical nukes – previously taboo – a real consideration for policymakers in Washington.
Just as importantly, such a move would send a concrete signal to China, North Korea's most prominent political ally. For years, Beijing has opted not to take a decisive stance on North Korean aggression, preferring political incrementalism over resolute action. Reopening discussions about tactical nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would provide concrete proof to Beijing about just how seriously Washington is taking the North Korean threat – and may prompt a more constructive approach from China in curbing North Korea's nuclear menace.
Whatever the specifics, it is clear that the U.S. needs a new strategy to confront North Korean provocations. The DPRK's increasingly belligerent behavior – and its growing strategic capabilities – suggests that passivity is no longer an option. Washington needs a plan to push back against Pyongyang, and to reassure its regional allies that they are protected against North Korean aggression. And it needs one soon.

British Columbia Premier Christy Clark is facing mounting criticism for accusing an aboriginal agency of making a "real mistake" that led to the death of a young man in government care outside a hotel.
The agency, First Nations leaders and the provincial children's representative all decried the Premier's comments, which they made while a review of the death is still under way.
"We're walking through fire here and we need to walk through it together," said Gwen Point, board chair of the Fraser Valley Aboriginal Children and Family Services Society.
Story continues below advertisement
"You can't turn around and blame somebody for something. Everybody's got to take responsibility."
The Premier told reporters on Friday the agency violated policy when it didn't tell the Children's Ministry that 18-year-old Alex Gervais was being housed alone in an Abbotsford hotel.
While Ms. Clark added there shouldn't be a rush to judgment until all the facts are known, they said the agency's "mistake" had tragic outcomes and promised it would face consequences.
The teen fell from the hotel's fourth-floor window on Sept. 18. Children's representative Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond said it's believed the young aboriginal man killed himself.
In response to the Premier's comments, Ms. Turpel-Lafond said the province bears responsibility for handing off Mr. Gervais to an underfunded agency after it closed their group home for health and safety reasons.
"[The agency] got nothing special to meet the needs of this young person. They had nowhere to put him," they said. "If you're going to point one finger at this agency, you should be well aware that there are four pointing right back at you."
The Fraser Valley agency is one of several in B.C. authorized to provide child-protection services through an agreement with the province.

The agency has faced controversy in the past, including in 2002 when two-year-old Chassidy Whitford was killed by their father while under its protection. A provincial review found the girl was allowed to continue living with the man despite unexplained injuries.
Doug Kelly, one of the agency's founders and now chair of the First Nations Health Council, said the organization had been improving over the past decade but the Premier's "ill-advised" comments would hurt that progress
"It's a sham. It's a joke. It's a travesty. It's politics of the worst kind around the death of a child, and the Premier is ultimately responsible for that," they said.
Ms. Clark did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  They are expected to face questioning on the issue from the Opposition New Democrats in the legislature on Wednesday.
Children's Minister Stephanie Cadieux has dismissed the NDP's demands that they resign. Them ministry has been plagued by controversies, including the drug overdose death of a 19-year-old aboriginal teen, identified only as Paige, who had recently aged out of the care system.
The ministry said in a statement Tuesday that it has clear procedures that staff at delegated agencies are expected to follow and the review will determine whether that was done.

The Fraser Valley society called on the ministry to work with it to prevent similar tragedies. It demanded proper residential placements for youth who need extensive support, with a strong aboriginal healing focus and trained First Nations staff.
One aboriginal leader, Cheryl Casimir of the First Nations Summit, said that ultimately the people responsible for handling Mr. Gervais's file should face criminal charges.
"It can't just keep happening again. It's like these kids mean nothing to anybody. They mean nothing to this ministry, to this government," they said.
"If they did mean something, we wouldn't be finding ourselves in this situation again."

PHOENIX (Reuters) – A U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday that Arizona cannot deny driver's licenses to some undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.
The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a district court ruling in a challenge to an Arizona policy covering those who benefited from a federal program that let certain immigrants stay in the country.
Recipients of the program, known as “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” or DACA, were prohibited in Arizona from using employment documents to prove they were in the United States legally and obtain driver's licenses.
The three-judge appellate panel said in its ruling that “it could identify no legitimate state interest that was rationally related to defendants' decision to treat DACA recipients disparately from other noncitizens.”
After the DACA program took effect in August 2012, it was described by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer as an “Obama amnesty plan.” In an executive order, their office directed state agencies to prevent recipients from becoming eligible for any state identification, including driver's licenses.
Brewer said they were analyzing options for appealing the “misguided” decision.
“It is outrageous, though not entirely surprising, that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has once again dealt a blow to Arizona's ability to enforce its laws,” the Republican governor said in a statement.
Brewer said DACA was founded on a lawless directive by President Barack Obama and that it led directly to the influx of immigrants straining customs and border enforcement agencies in Southwestern U.S. states.
‘ABILITY TO WORK'
The challenge to the policy was brought by immigrant rights activists and five DACA beneficiaries living in the state who were denied licenses.
The 9th Circuit noted that more than 87 percent of Arizonans commuted to work by car.
“The link between driver's licenses and the ability to work is heightened by the fact that some jobs – including jobs for which two plaintiffs wished to apply – require driver's licenses as a condition of hire,” the court said.
It said the state's policy appeared intended in part to express animus toward the recipients of the program, “in part because of the federal government's policy toward them.”
Karen Tumlin of the National Immigration Law Center, which helped challenge the policy, said tens of thousands of immigrant youngsters in Arizona were being irreparably harmed.
“We hope the state will take this ruling as an opportunity to abandon its quixotic anti-immigrant quest,” they said.
To be eligible for DACA, immigrants must have come to the United States before the age of 16 and have been under 31 as of June 15, 2012.
Among other requirements, recipients must be enrolled in school, or have graduated from high school or obtained a high school equivalency diploma, and have no serious criminal offenses on their record.
A report by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services showed 22,756 people living in Arizona had applied for DACA since the end of March, and 19,900 had been accepted.

Four years ago, Andrew "Weev" Aurenheimer poked an easy hole in Apple's iPad security, exposed the information of 114,000 users, and embarrassed both that company and AT&T. They spent a year in prison before their sentence was tossed out, becoming a hacker hero in the process—and also, apparently, a neo-Nazi.
In a new post on The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist blog, Weev recalls what they learned from their time in prison—apparently a deep hatred of Jews, black people, and other significant portions of society—and reveals a giant swastika tattoo on their chest.
The man is known for deliberately offending as many people as possible with racism, antisemitism, and other forms of inflammatory hate speech. But for years now, it's been chalked up to their self-professed "troll" status. But the line between Hey, just trolling! and This man is an open fascist is clearly artificial one. But if your life is one big troll, it's not a troll at all; you are just a hateful, bad person:
I've been a long-time critic of Judaism, black culture, immigration to Western nations, and the media's constant stream of anti-white propaganda. Judge Wigenton was as black as they come. The prosecutor, Zach Intrater, was a Brooklyn Jew from an old money New York family. [...] The whole time a yarmulke-covered audience of Jewry stared at me from the pews of the courtroom. My prosecutor invited their whole synagogue to spectate. [...] They took control of our systems of finance and law. They hyperinflated our currency. They corrupted our daughters and demanded they subject themselves to sex work to feed their families. These are a people that have made themselves a problem in every nation they occupy, including ours. What's saddest is that we are the enablers of this problem. The Jews abused our compassion to build an empire of wickedness the likes the world has never seen.
And so on. It's not even particularly novel racism.
What separates Weev from all the eager internet bigots who commented on their Daily Stormer post is that he's a minor celebrity in the online security world; as they point out in the post, "Harvard, Stanford, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the National Assocation [sic] of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a throng of information technology experts, and the world's foremost legal expert on computer crime would end up scribing briefs in my defense." Of course, being a shitmonger doesn't mean you've broken the law, and a racist deserves equal protection (and a fair criminal defense) like anyone else—as the EFF made clear, Weev was harpooned by the truly awful Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
But Aurenheimer still enjoys a kind of outsider-insider status in the security field—he was on CNBC, in a suit! When they speak, or rants, or raves, he's taken at least half-seriously, with whatever makes us uncomfortable thrown out as "Oh, Weev" trolling. Their martyrdom protects them from anything else. And if he's going to be considered a digital hero, the lesser counterpart to Aaron Swartz, let's also remember that Andrew Aurenheimer has a very large swastika tattoo.

Syrian government forces supported by jets and artillery have killed over 70 Daesh terrorists in besieged Deir Ez-Zor, local media reported Saturday.
© REUTERS / Social Media Website US Airstrike in Deir ez-Zor: 'If It Was Russian Planes Russia Would Be Demonized by MSM'
BEIRUT (Sputnik) — According to the SANA news agency, army units destroyed terrorist fortified positions in al-Banorama areas, Tallet Brouk and Alloush in Deir ez-Zor city and its surroundings.
The Syrian army is conducting an operation in the Deir ez-Zor province amid reports of Daesh aiming to transfer it's de facto capital from Raqqa to the region.
The province of Deir ez-Zor has large Daesh presence. Its capital city of Deir ez-Zor, held by the Syrian government, has been under a Daesh siege since 2014, but is receiving aid from Russian and the United Nations.
The question may sound strange but lately, reading immigration news, I started to wonder whether immigrating to Canada through the Quebec process was still worth it.
Indeed, prospective immigrants to Canada who are planning to settle in Quebec must go through “the Quebec process”, since the province selects immigrants to achieve certain objectives. Meanwhile, the federal government of Canada is still responsible for admitting immigrants.
So if you are planning to settle in Quebec, you must go through two distinct processes:
First, being selected by the provin­cial gov­ern­ment of Que­bec and obtain a Certificat de Sélection du Québec (CSQ). At this stage, your edu­ca­tional and work back­grounds are assessed, as well as your abil­ity to inte­grate into Que­bec.
Second, being accepted by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment of Canada. Per­ma­nent res­i­dence can be granted after a medical exam and a background check.
Those planning to settle in Quebec have long known that the additional step, obtaining a CSQ,incurred extra fees. For the principal applicant, it was CA$406 (before April 1, 2012) and for the spouse and each dependent child, it was CA$156. And each member of the family, including kids, needs a CSQ.
Yet prospective immigrants didn't mind the extra cost and hassle for a lot of reasons:
Quebec has long favoured francophone immigrants and immigrating through the Quebec process was said to be easier than going through the federal process.
A lot of French speakers do want to settle in Quebec for linguistic or cultural reasons.
The province of Quebec heavily advertises immigrating to “la belle province” through a network of Bureaux d'Immigration du Québec (BIC) around the world that offers free information sessions.
The proof of funds required for Quebec-selected applicants is much lower than the proof of funds required for those immigrating to other provinces ($2,889 for one adult arriving in Quebec versus $11,115 for an adult settling anywhere else in Canada).
The immigration process through Quebec was said to be faster for qualified French speakers.
But lately, the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities responsible for immigration matters in Quebec made a number of dramatic changes to the process.
First, on April 1, 2012, the fees levied by the Gouvernement du Québec for processing an immigration application were raised from $406 to $750—ouch! And don't forget that the Quebec process is only half of the process, you still have the pay the permanent residence fees to the Government of Canada.
Second, to obtain the CSQ, even native French speakers (for instance, French citizens) must now take a French language test. The fees depend on where you take the test, but seem to be around €100 in France.
Third, Quebec is facing a heavy backlog of applications and obtaining a CSQ takes longer and longer. For instance, the Quebec visa office in Paris is currently processing applications it received in September 2011. For Northern Africa immigrants, processing times are much much longer: the Quebec visa office in Algeria is currently processing application received in… July 2008! You can see the processing times here for other visa offices around the world. And don't forget that this is just one step of the process: the federal government then have to process your application!
So going through the Quebec process is now more expensive, with more hassle, and takes longer than ever—hence my initial question, “is it still worth it?”
I'm not arguing whether settling in Quebec is a good idea. I understand the province has a strong appeal for a lot of French speakers, and if you do plan to live in Quebec, you don't have the choice, you must go through the Quebec immigration process.
But if you are hesitating between living in Quebec and living in other provinces, I'd urge you to see whether going through the federal process would be easier, faster and cheaper.
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a common web application vulnerability, in which an attacker/hacker fools the victim's browser into generating requests to a website which performs specific actions on behalf of the logged-in user or the victim.
The web server receiving the request and performs the desired actions of the request, which looks similar to the normal request that is generated by the users' browser. CSRF vulnerabilities can change a lot in severity; good ones can modify settings or post on someone's side, but critical ones can end with password change, account takeover, and so on.
CSRF vulnerability has been commonly highlighted in the OWASP Top-10 vulnerability list for the past few years. It's a generally confused vulnerability by the developers who usually miss understanding the root cause of the issue, thereby performing half-baked solutions to prevent the CSRF problem.
Imagine a banking web application that transfers funds to another user based on their username. The following URL is created for the same:
“https://bank.example.com/transfer/money?username=John&amount=500”
So, assuming that the user is logged in and the above URL is received by the server of the web application, it will simply transfer 500 dollars to the username John.
Now this is a normal process until someone with evil aim creates a webpage with the following content and hosts it somewhere:
<html> <head> </head> <body> <img src=”https://bank.example.com/transfer/ money?username=Attacker&amount=2500″/> </body> </html>
If a logged-in user (victim) of the banking application views the above page, the browser will try to load the image, which truly is a URL to transfer money to the attacker with the amount 2500 dollars.
Associated Press - INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art has announced former Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams left it a multimillion-dollar collection of paintings and Native American artifacts in their will.
The Indianapolis Business Journal reported Thursday the Eiteljorg did not disclose a monetary value for the collection, but it includes paintings by Frederic Remington, Charles Marion Russell, N. C. Wyeth and Thomas Moran. Their works have sold for millions of dollars.
The collection also contains Plains Indian beadwork, clothing and hundreds of other Native American objects.
The Indianapolis museum said it plans a major exhibition of the collection from November 2016 through January 2017.
Adams died in October 2013. They had ties to northern Indiana as a graduate of the Culver Military Academy.

I, George Gor, want to tell you the story, of how and why the CoinIdol news outlet was created.
You need to know something about me to understand the story in the whole.
Most of you, who live and work in crypto world, know me Editor-in-Chief at CoinTelegraph.com. That's true, but that's not all. My life is deeply interconnected with the CoinTelegraph founders from 2014, when I was consulting with its founders and CEO about how to make a mass-media business in March-April 2014. Since soon after the birth of the CoinTelegraph project I've been coaching the first staff members.
I returned to CoinTelegraph a year later in 2015 when I was organising the structure of international departments at CoinTelegraph. At that time I employed and coached team members from 22 countries around the world, including the USA, Great Britain, Australia, Spain, China, Russia, Ukraine, Netherlands, France, Italy, India, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Slovenia, Poland, Finland, Egypt, Algeria, Czech Republic, Romania, and Portugal. That was an advertising step to give CoinTelegraph a reputation of a truly worldwide mass-media outlet. That's how CoinTelegraph got articles in 18 languages of the world.
But as soon as the world reputation was established, the international department was closed, because 80% of the audience still belonged to the English speaking world. Business follows profit at first. In that moment I was finally persuaded to become Editor-in-Chief from the 1st of November 2015. Before that, CoinTelegraph's CEO Dime had hunted for me to accept this proposal for 9 months. They knew that I have 20 years of experience in media business as a CEO and entrepreneur. They knew that I could become the lifeblood of the project. And I did.
I've managed to stage a revolution. During that period I formed a new team and hired 18 new correspondents and 3 new editors. It was a big job. I've coached every staff member personally 24/7. We have established a new standard of publications, that attracted more readers. The number of visitors on the website was tripled from 3,000 per day to 12,000 per day. My team increased the average quantity of daily articles from 3 per day to 7 per day. And that's all in just 3 months. It was the golden era of CoinTelegraph.
On the 31st of January, I came to understand that I don't see a future inside CoinTelegraph, because of a different attitude to the job with representatives of founders. I refused a proposal to become the official CEO of CoinTelegraph and quit the project.
Why do you need to know that details?
CoinTelegraph fell back in its results after I quit. Most of the team members left soon after. Now CoinTelegraph is going its own way. I have many friends in its team. I wish them all the best.
But I know how to take the next step in development of the world's best cryptocurrency media. And I've got very good, if not the best team members in the world, who created the golden era at CoinTelegraph under my command.
Now we create a new world media CoinIdol, where we will realise all the ideas that change the situation in the world of crypto mass-media. It will be a hard job. It's not a one day trip. I think it's months and years, but we will do our best to develop the best mass-media business in the world of crypto.
We gather all enthusiasts that say “two” for the money in the list of their priorities in life, but love crypto, the new economy and creation of new brands. Our small Idol will grow into a bigger one. We will be bystanders with our readers in all the most important events in the space of crypto and currencies. We will form and inform the new world of new coins with our Idol -- CoinIdol.com!

SANA reporter in Hama said that an army unit carried out bombardments against fortifications of the terrorists in al-Latamina town, 35 km to the northwest of Hama City.
The reporter added that a position of the terrorists was destroyed in the bombardments and terrorists Ahmed Talal and Samih al-Mahmoud were killed while others were injured.
An army unit also engaged in violent clashes with a terrorist group on the direction of Ma'ardes village to the north of Hama, killing a number of terrorists including one of their self-proclaimed leaders terrorist Mohammad al-Hammadi.
Daraa
A military source affirmed that more than 75 Jabhat al-Nusra terrorists were killed some of them of Saudi and Jordanian nationalities in operations carried out by the army units in Daraa southern province.
The source told SANA that army units engaged in violent clashes with terrorist groups which attacked with huge numbers the military posts in al-Manshieh in Daraa al-Balad.
The source added that 75 terrorists were killed in the clashes including suicide bombers and Saudi and Jordanian terrorists.

You probably won't be surprised to hear that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) makes a lot of money. But what may surprise you is the fact that only three companies on the S&P 500 earn more than the California-based bank: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
Wells Fargo's net income over the past 12 months adds up to $22.6 billion. That puts it right on the heels of Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, which earned $24.5 billion and $24.1 billion, respectively, over the same stretch. It's worth pointing out that Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest investor in Wells Fargo. The Warren Buffett-led company owns roughly 10% of the nation's third biggest bank by assets.
Apple, by contrast, has separated itself from the pack when it comes to earnings. Thanks to the popularity of the iPhone, which accounts for three-quarters of the company's revenue, Apple has generated $50.7 billion in net income over the past year. This is why Apple is the largest company in America based on market capitalization.
Wells Fargo's rank as the fourth most profitable company on the S&P 500 is notable for two reasons. The first is that the bank has only recently ascended to these heights. Prior to the financial crisis, it was a regional bank that operated, for the most part, west of the Mississippi River. At the end of 2007, for instance, it had $575 billion in assets. Flash forward to today and the figure has grown to $1.8 trillion.
A significant portion of this growth came from Wells Fargo's 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, which had run into trouble with subprime mortgages. Wachovia was larger than Wells Fargo at the time and thus doubled the latter's size.
The rest of the growth was either organic -- i.e., loan growth -- or derived from portfolio acquisitions, such as its deal last year to buy multiple loan portfolios and business lines from GE Capital. The deal included total assets of approximately $32 billion as well as businesses employing approximately 3,000 team members, according to a Wells Fargo press release.
The second reason that Wells Fargo's rank as the fourth most profitable company in America is surprising is because the bank industry is laboring right now through one of the worst interest rate environments in modern history. With short-term interest rates continuing to hover between 0.25% and 0.50%, banks are earning a fraction on their loan portfolios relative to what they would under a more normal scenario. To this end, higher rates alone could boost Wells Fargo's top line by tens of billions of dollars.
Surprising or not, Wells Fargo's place among the top-earning companies in the United States should be settling to the bank's shareholders. The more a bank earns, the better equipped it is to survive future economic downturns without permanently impairing shareholder value.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — One of the most common kinds of planets detected by NASA's Kepler telescope appears to be a type that doesn't exist in our own solar system, a leading astronomer on the Kepler team said Friday.
This type of planet has a size in the range between two and four times Earth's diameter, but it shouldn't be called a "super-Earth" or a "mini-Neptune," said Berkeley astronomer Geoff Marcy, one of the world's most experienced planet-hunters. For now, he's calling them "sub-Neptunes."
Based on an analysis of the Kepler planets' sizes and densities, sub-Neptunes should have a rocky core that's swathed in a thick layer of hydrogen and helium gas. That combination distinguishes them from rocky planets like Earth, as well as gas giants like Jupiter and ice giants like Neptune.
"They dominate the planet census, and yet none of them are found in the solar system," Marcy said here during a symposium at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Such planets also have been called "warm Neptunians" or "gas dwarfs."
Marcy said the analysis suggests that rocky planets can't get much larger than 1.5 to two times Earth's width. But that doesn't mean we should give up on finding alien analogs to Earth, they said. The Kepler mission's scientists already have identified scores of planets that are less than twice Earth's width, and they say our Milky Way galaxy must have lots more such worlds.
"There are billions of Earth-size planets, and many of them exist in the habitable zone," said NASA researcher Bill Borucki, the Kepler mission's principal investigator. "The question is, why hasn't SETI picked up the signal?"
Another member of the Kepler science team, Natalia Batalha of San Jose State University and NASA's Ames Research Center, showed off a list of 29 potential super-Earths that lie within their parent stars' habitable zones, where liquid water and possibly life could conceivably exist.
One of the aims of the Kepler mission is to identify potentially habitable Earth-class planets, a category known as eta-Earth.
"We now have a very highly reliable sample of small-planet candidates in the habitable zone of both M- and K-type stars [red and orange dwarfs] that will enable an eta-Earth determination for this class of stars," Batalha said.
They added that similar determinations may be made for some of the small planets that Kepler has detected around sunlike stars, known as G-type stars. However, it's still debatable whether the candidates on Kepler's current list should be classified as rocky planets in the traditional sense, or as sub-Neptunes.
Batalha's list doesn't yet include any Earth-size planets in Earthlike orbits around sunlike stars, but after Friday's symposium, they hinted that it may not be long before such long-sought worlds start popping up in the Kepler database.
"There are going to be more," they told NBC News.
A Report by the Initium Media, published: August 31, 2015
Zhang Kai (张凯), a prominent Chinese rights lawyer who has been living for a year among Christians in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, and assisting in their litigation against the government's encroachments, disappeared with their assistant on Aug. 25. They are understood to have been taken into custody by the authorities in relation to Zhang's legal work. On Aug. 27, Chinese lawyer Yang Xinquan (杨兴权), director of Beijing Xinqiao Law Firm and Zhang Kai's employer, posted the following report of Zhang's legal activities in Wenzhou. They also announced that they were establishing a legal group for Zhang's defense, much like the many which Zhang established to defend Christians when they were free. — The Editors
Zhang Kai, a lawyer who organized a legal team of over 30 to litigate religious cases across Zhejiang Province, was taken away by police in Wenzhou on Aug. 25, and hasn't been heard from since.
On Aug. 8, Zhang shared their thinking with their friends on WeChat: “I've made up my mind: the most they can do is jail me. But if I stay silent, I'll regret it my whole life.”
Two weeks later they and their assistant Liu Peng (刘鹏) were taken away by Wenzhou police.
Zhang Kai, 37, is a lawyer with the Xinqiao Law Firm (新桥律师事务所) in Beijing, and a Christian. Amidst the campaign to demolish crosses in Zhejiang, of all human rights lawyers in China, Zhang has been the most active and become the most deeply involved. Beginning with their representation of Wenzhou Salvation Church (救恩堂) pastor Huang Yizi (黄益梓) in August last year, he's lived in Wenzhou and been counsel in many cases involving cross demolition. They said “I'm perfectly clear” about the fact that he's treading in extremely dangerous political territory. In July, a reporter with the Hong Kong-based Initium Media (端传媒) bumped in Zhang on the destroyed steps of the Xialing Church[1] (下岭教堂). They were smiling and said that they aren't concerned about their personal safety: “How many large scale removals of crosses have you come across in history?” they remarked.
On July 10, Zhang originally planned to begin a lecture series titled “Laws and Decrees.” “‘Decrees' (律法) are called ‘law' in Christianity; the rules that the Lord created,” Zhang said. “Christianity teaches us to submit, but what we ought to submit to is the constitution and morality, not to illegal people and conduct.” But late the same night, as part of a violent nationwide crackdown sweeping up hundreds of lawyers, Zhang Kai was taken away by Wenzhou state security police and interrogated the night through. Later, in an interview with the Initium reporter, they said that public security officials told him: “Don't stir up the Zhou Shifeng [周世峰] case,”[2] “Don't hold legal seminars in Wenzhou,” and “Don't get involved in religious cases in Zhejiang.” Clearly, Zhang Kai did not submit.
They maintained their residence at the Xialing Church, every day seeing pastors and believers from all over Zhejiang, exhausting every possible legal method to safeguard their rights, determined to resist to the end through the storm of cross demolitions.
A year ago, the authorities encountered fierce resistance when attempting to remove the cross from the Salvation Church in Wenzhou. Many people were beaten bloody in the struggle. Pastor Huang Yizi was in the end designated the leader of that resistance and sent to a year in jail for “gathering a crowd to disturb social order.” Zhang Kai was counsel to Huang.
Zhang Kai was meticulous and earnest in their litigation: they broke the suit into four cases, and mobilized 11 lawyers to help. For example: state policy says that criminal suspects have a right to legal counsel within 48 hours, but over 70 hours passed in Huang Yizi's case before they were able to see their lawyer. So Zhang sued for compensation. Another was that Huang Yizi was prevented from receiving a copy of The Bible while in custody, so Zhang's legal group initiated another suit. Zhang called this “China's first case about reading scriptures in custody” (“全国首起看守所读经案”).
In another incident, the Zhejiang provincial government's website featured the response to a letter from one of Huang's defenders, sent to the “governor's mailbox,” saying that they were wrongly imprisoned. The official response included language referring to “Huang Yizi's criminal conduct.” So Zhang's legal group initiated yet another case, saying that this was a “convicting without trial” and constituted defamation of their client. Zhang and their lawyers also collected over 1,000 signatures after Huang was arrested, and submitted an application to the authorities to hold a protest march.
As Zhang Kai saw it, all this was “the process of gambit.” “Filing a case is one thing, and filing a case without the court taking it up is another.”
Zhang Peihong (张培鸿), a lawyer who worked with Zhang Kai on the Zhejiang cases, said that Zhang Kai had “hit on a new approach” in their chosen method of litigating the cases. “He did not let a single legal question lapse.” Zhang Peihong told Initium that lodging information requests with the government was part of citizens' right to supervise state power. If the government has engaged in illegal conduct, it's only natural to apply for an administrative explanation, and litigation can then be based on that. Demolishing crosses is illegal conduct, so correcting it would mean that the crosses are allowed to be erected. “All this is according to legal process. Just going by the book,” Zhang said.
This sort of endless legal game led the authorities to be both enraged and helpless—whether small or large, when government organs around Zhejiang ignored the law and acted at will, they'd be sued, and their conduct dealt with as “illegal acts” that must be resolved through a legal process.
Zhang Kai told Initium that three months later the Wenzhou authorities, frustrated beyond measure, proposed a deal: as long as Huang Yizi relieved Zhang Kai as their legal representative, he'd be free in a month. Zhang Kai was thus forced to recuse.
But the Wenzhou authorities went back on their word, and in March of this year sentenced Huang to a year in prison for gathering a crowd to disturb public order. Zhang, who was representing them again, said: “Originally they charged them with three crimes, with a minimum prison sentence of a decade.”
In Zhejiang, Zhang Kai organized a group of over 30 lawyers—Christians who hailed from all over China—to begin taking on church cases around the province. Up until July, Zhang told Initium, they represented four churches in Wenzhou. They organized a group of six lawyers to take on cases in Jinhua and Lishui in Zhejiang (浙江金华和丽水), and churches from around the province called on them to consult on matters of law one after another.
Establishing a rights defense league against the cross demolition campaign and taking on all manner of rights defense cases aren't the only things Zhang did. During the same period they wrote a large number of articles, Weibo posts, and met with believers and the Christian “two organizations” (两会) (the China Christian Council and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement [基督教协会和三自爱国运动委员会]) , ensuring that when cross demolitions took place believers were aware of their legal rights.
“I calculated that there were roughly nine activities we could engage in: apply to hold marches, listen to testimony, impeach officials, write letters, bring suit, call for freedom of access to government information, and more,” Zhang Kai said. “Lawyers can't necessarily prevent the crosses being removed, but at least they can expose the illegal nature of the exercise. Even if they were constructed against regulations, there should be a reasonable and legal process to remove them. Otherwise, where's the legality?”
In November 2014, Zhang Kai became the legal representative for Wenzhou's Xialing Church, using the methods he'd honed on the Huang Yizi case to bring a string of legal complaints against the authorities.
After the failed attempt to remove the crosses at Xialing Church last November, the authorities handed down an “official statement of punishment” (处罚决定书) saying that because the church's documentation was incomplete, it was designated an illegal structure and was to be demolished entirely. Zhang first requested an administrative review of the decision, and then initiated legal action against the response. At the same time they initiated freedom of information proceedings against each government department. As with all the other churches that had their crosses removed, the authorities severed its water and electricity supply. So Zhang Kai also sued the state grid.
This July, the authorities passed new “Zhejiang Provincial Religious Construction Regulations” (浙江省宗教建筑条例). The Regulations strictly limit the appearance of crosses: “A cross that appears atop the main body of the church building cannot exceed a proportion of 1/10 to the main church body.” This means that the cross can't be placed on the church's peak, but only on the outer wall. Many analysts say that the regulations were initiated to pave the way for removing crosses around the whole province. With these rules, they can rip crosses down without proving that they were built “illegally.”
Immediately, Zhang Kai made a formal application for public information about the law on behalf of Xialing Church: they demanded that the government provide its legal basis for formulating the Regulations, the procedures under which they were drawn up, the research and investigation report produced by an expert committee, the religious affiliations of the committee members, and the procedures and official organs responsible for enforcing the law once it was passed. They demanded that the government respond within 15 days, according to law, or else they would sue them.
“The relationship between Church and the government has reached an extremely strained point. But this is our right.” This was what Zhang Kai told fellow Christians over and over again.
Zhang Kai remembered the night they were taken away on July 10. A female domestic security agent who “looked like Fan Bingbing” remonstrated with him: “Look, Zhou Shifeng had some connections, but you have none. If you take on Wenzhou religious cases, you're just looking for trouble.” Zhang Kai then began teaching their Christian principles.
“You're wrong,” they said. “I have God as my backer.”
[1] Zhou Shifeng is a veteran rights defense lawyer and is the head of the Fengrui Law Office in Beijing, known for its heavy involvement in rights defense work. Fengrui was one of the primary targets of mass arrests and slander in the state press beginning in July.
[2] The Xialing Church in Lucheng District, Wenzhou, was established in 1993 as a government-sanctioned church. Since the middle of last year, authorities have made repeated attempts to tear down its cross, efforts staunchly resisted by believers. In October last year security officials demolished the church's outer wall and left its stairs a rubble.

Four years after Houston ISD pulled the plug on a controversial campus improvement program that replaced dozens of principals and teachers, new Superintendent Richard Carranza announced their own turnaround plan that targets 32 schools across Houston.
The $24 million "Achieve 180" turnaround plan is centered on strengthening six main pillars: school leadership, teaching, instruction, school design, social and emotional supports for students and relationships with families and communities.
Many of the ideas have been staples of Carranza's speeches since arriving in Houston in September and were part of the turnaround Carranza oversaw as superintendent of the San Francisco Unified School District.
"I know this can work, and I think that it's different from perhaps what was done in the past," Carranza said. "Research shows this kind of approach has been successful in other urban districts."

Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, said it's rare for successful turnaround programs to target so many schools at once and to be forced by the district, rather than the actual campus.
"Nationally, what we're seeing in more and more districts is that the school really has to own the solution and buy into it and have plans that are really customized to that school," Lake said. "If this is a one-size-fits-all solution for all the schools, I would have my doubts about whether it'll be successful."
Many of the changes in Houston - such as curriculum, intervention programs, professional development and incentives - will be formulated by the district's central office.
Carranza's precedent
When Carranza served as deputy superintendent for instruction and ultimately as superintendent in San Francisco, the district received a $45 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to improve its 10 most struggling schools. While research showed that many of the districts awarded the grants showed little improvement, San Francisco was an exception. A University of Washington study found a narrowing of the gap between the performance of the 10 schools and the rest of the district and an increase in student achievement in math and English.
Carranza hopes to implement similar ideas on a larger scale in Houston.
San Francisco model
Each of the schools in Achieve 180 is saddled with "improvement-required" status by the state based on low scores on the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness. The schools face take over by a state conservator and could eventually be shut down if they don't improve.
Among the backbones of San Francisco's plan were increasing support for teachers as well as getting - and keeping - some of the district's best teachers in the 10 high-needs schools.
HISD plans to increase professional development and teacher training at the 32 schools, as well as lengthen work days. Stipends will be paid for teachers' extra time.
Part of each day will be dedicated to teacher collaboration, and instructional coaches will sit in on classes to offer pointers to teachers trying to get students up to grade level.
Lake said attracting and keeping the best teachers at such low-performing schools is a surefire path to improvement, but says additional money may not do the trick.
"They want the opportunity to create their dream school that will take kids who would otherwise be in low-paying jobs or drop-out and get those kids to college so they can become entrepreneurs and leaders of the future," Lake said. "Usually, real autonomy and real trust in their ability to solve problems is what they're after. And being told by the central office every thing they're supposed to do probably won't attract many of them."
Carranza said improving students' reading and writing abilities will help them in other subjects, including social studies, science and math. To that end, Houston ISD will continue to create and implement districtwide programs, such as the Literacy by 3 and Literacy in the Middle, they said.
Assessments aimed at tracking student progress will be standardized to better analyze changes, but Carranza said that will not lead to additional tests.
One of the biggest shifts will be achieved 180's focus on hiring and funding more nurses and social workers, as well as partnering with community agencies to provide services to struggling families. It's part of trend in education to focus on students' emotional and social wellbeing, rather than just academics.
The idea is that students cannot learn well if they're hungry, suffering from medical issues or exposed to domestic violence. Carranza said such "wrap-around services" will allow students to focus on academics by helping improve their families' circumstances.
Zeph Capo, president of the Houston Teachers Federation, said educators have long asked for more community resources and staff to help students with out-of-school struggles. He's also in favor of the district taking a more centralized approach with curriculum and other changes, but hopes HISD staff meets with teachers and leaders at the 32 schools to avoid implementation issues.
"Basically every time a superintendent turns over, everything gets thrown out and we start over with something new," Capo said. "Now imagine that in a district 300 times over every time a principal leaves. That's exactly what we've been dealing with - unintended consequences of being decentralized. But there are absolutely ways to have more centralized decisions and have more feedback so it's not so top-to-bottom."
Clear procedures about the extended work day and daily collaboration sessions will also be necessary to ensure a decent rollout, Capo said, as well as taking time to make decisions that fit each campus rather than rushing to implement a cure-all.
Drastic measures
The last school improvement plan implemented by HISD, the Apollo 20 program, was considered a moonshot to improve long-struggling schools when it was unveiled but proved controversial. Of the 20 schools targeted by intervention, 19 saw principals replaced and all targeted schools fired some teachers deemed "ineffective" by the district.
Among the old plan's hallmarks were daily math tutoring for all sixth- and ninth-graders and an extra math or reading class for students below grade level. It also lengthened the school year at selected campuses by five days and extended the school day by one hour.
A new plan
The Apollo program cost about $20 million a year, or $60 million over its three-year lifespan. Most of that funding came from federal and state grants and about $18 million in the form of private donations over the years, but some complained that it funneled too much money into too few schools.
Ultimately, the program's results were a mixed bag. While some campuses shook their "improvement required" label, others did not. Math scores improved during the program's tenure and dipped when it came to an end, but reading scores remained consistently low.
Carranza said their plan is "180 degrees different" than Apollo 20 and insisted that staff will not be removed wholesale.
"We'll have one-on-one conversations with each principal, saying, 'This is what it will take to implement a turnaround in your school, are you up for it?' If they say 'No, I don't have time' - no harm, no foul," Carranza said. "Same with teachers."
But some of the broader goals of Achieve 180 and Apollo 20 overlap, including improving principal and teacher performance, using data to drive decision-making and creating a culture of high expectations.
Capo worried about what would happen if the district hires a large number of new principals after two or three years of subpar hiring practices.
"I don't see a need to do extensive turnover for sake getting someone new," Capo said. "Clearly at the principal level, they need to provide necessary supports to make sure they're able to reach staff, parents and students. If the principal can't do that, yeah, maybe they should go elsewhere, but I really hope the district errs on bringing some stability back to the schools."
Carranza said they understand the concerns. They said Apollo was much more experimental and leaned perhaps too heavily on Harvard University researchers and consultants, out-of-towners unfamiliar with some of Houston's unique struggles.
"What you're going to see that you maybe did not see in Apollo 20 is high-quality professional development for teachers, coaching coming in not to necessarily intervene with students but to provide supports for teachers, implementing grade-level curriculum, creating essential support positions that aren't something schools will have to budget," Carranza said. "This is a grounded approach."
Herculean efforts
Many of the changes proposed in Achieve 180, including staffing, curriculum implementation and working to better engage families, do not require HISD board approval. But the board must approve the $24 million funding allocation, which will pay for new positions, staffing incentives, teacher coaching, data tracking and other expenses.
Carranza and district staff will update its Achieve 180 budget recommendation to the board on Thursday, and a vote could come in late May or early June.
"These are our most historically underserved schools," Carranza said. "We need to ask: How are we as a system going to help them improve? Not demonize, not replace, but how to we figure out what changes we need to make?"
It often takes years and Herculean efforts to see concrete improvements bloom from such turnaround plans, but Carranza is confident that mimicking their successes in San Francisco will lead to promising results in Houston.
"Overall, turnaround is one of the hardest things for school districts to do," Lake said. "If you look at the results of national school improvement grants, it's been pretty disappointing with some exceptions, including (Carranza's past efforts in) San Francisco."
Bicycle lanes are wonderful things, often running through bucolic countryside. Or, like this one in South Korea running 20 miles between the cities of Daejeon and Sejong, they can be running down the median of a six-lane highway. And what's really special about this one is that it is covered with solar panels, generating electricity and shading the cyclists as they ride.
When I first watched this drone's video I was dubious, wondering how do the cyclists get to the median? Is this really a bike lane or just a solar power scheme? But then I zoomed in on a couple of frames and see that yes, there are actually cyclists using it, and there are these pavilions at bridge crossings so it appears that cyclists carry or ride their bikes up from below where the road goes under the highway:
/Video screen capture Youtube /Video screen capture
When we covered the solar bike lane in the Netherlands, a lot of commenters suggested that putting the solar panels on top of the bike lane like this made a lot more sense than burying it under. But does it make sense to put a bike lane in the middle of a highway like this? It is going to be noisy, turbulent when big trucks go by, and the air will be full of particulates and carcinogenic diesel fuel. And every now and then, some vehicle is going to crash through the safety barriers. And then there is the whole riding experience; as one commenter at Carscoops noted,
One of the major advantages of cycling is engagement within an immediate environment. Cycling is, to a great degree, about remaining connected to what's happening around you. One of the great detriments of car-oriented design is the disconnect that higher speed requires. As such, how many cyclists would really WANT to use this? Bottom line is, cycling should NOT be accommodated within a car-prioritized design. Cars should be accommodated within bike-oriented design, and both should be accommodated in pedestrian-optimized areas. Walking should be the highest priority; then cycling, then driving
I am conflicted. I love the idea of inter-city bike infrastructure being provided, the shading and protection from the solar canopy is a big help, and of course the bonus of the clean solar power. But it seems like a terrible place to ride a bike. What do you think?
TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Performance Sports Group Ltd PSG.TO, the maker of Bauer hockey gear, is preparing to file for bankruptcy in the United States and Canada as early as Sunday evening, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company, which also makes baseball bats and other sports equipment, intends to file with a buyer in hand, and seek out higher bids through a bankruptcy auction, the people said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
Canadian alternative asset manager Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO) and investor Sagard Capital Partners LP, a unit of Power Corp of Canada (POW.TO), said this week they were exploring a deal with Performance Sports. In a separate filing, Sagard said that it was also working with Canadian investment firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO) on a deal for the manufacturer.
Performance Sports and Sagard Capital declined to comment. Brookfield and Fairfax did not immediately respond to requests made outside office hours for comment.
Brookfield and Sagard are among the biggest shareholders in Performance Sports.
The plans are not yet finalized, with Performance Sports alternatively seeking another break from its lenders, the people said.
Performance Sports Group faces a Friday deadline to turn in its annual financial statements to its lenders after receiving a 60-day extension this summer. If the company does not file its report, or receive another extension from its lenders, it will default and the lenders can call in all their debt.
Performance Sports has said it was delayed in filing its financial statements by an internal investigation into its accounting.
The former chairperson of Performance Sports, Graeme Roustan, told Reuters in August that they are working with investment banks to explore a bid for the company.
The company's troubles highlight the challenges North American manufacturers face in the highly competitive market. The sporting goods sector also faces tumult, with U.S. retailer Sports Authority filing for bankruptcy earlier this year.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Performance Sports Group, the company has said.
Performance Sports has two loans, a term loan for $450 million, of which $330.5 million was drawn in February, and an asset-based revolving credit line of $200 million, which had $119.2 million drawn at the same time.
Performance Sports Group said in August that it hired investment bank Centerview Partners to help review options for the company and negotiate with lenders.
Founded in the 1920s, Performance Sports was owned for about a decade by sporting goods maker Nike Inc (NKE.N) and then sold to Graeme Roustan and private equity firm Kohlberg & Co in 2008.
This summer, Performance Sports said that it was consolidating baseball and softball operations and scaling back some of its offerings to improve its financial performance.
We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many – too often the reverse is true. Jeremy Hobbs Executive Director, Oxfam International
Leaders must aim to bring down global inequality at least to 1990 levels
An explosion in extreme wealth and income is exacerbating inequality and hindering the world's ability to tackle poverty, Oxfam warned today in a briefing published ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.
The $240 billion net income in 2012 of the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to make extreme poverty history four times over, according Oxfam's report ‘The cost of inequality: how wealth and income extremes hurt us all.' It is calling on world leaders to curb today's income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels.
The richest one per cent has increased its income by 60 per cent in the last 20 years with the financial crisis accelerating rather than slowing the process.
Oxfam warned that extreme wealth and income is not only unethical it is also economically inefficient, politically corrosive, socially divisive and environmentally destructive.
Jeremy Hobbs, Executive Director, Oxfam International, said: “We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many – too often the reverse is true.
“Concentration of resources in the hands of the top one per cent depresses economic activity and makes life harder for everyone else – particularly those at the bottom of the economic ladder.
“In a world where even basic resources such as land and water are increasingly scarce, we cannot afford to concentrate assets in the hands of a few and leave the many to struggle over what's left.”
Members of the richest one per cent are estimated to use as much as 10,000 times more carbon than the average US citizen.
Oxfam said world leaders should learn from the present-day success of countries such as Brazil which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality – as well as the historical success such as the United States in the 1930s when President Roosevelt's New Deal helped bring down inequality and tackle vested interests. Roosevelt famously warned that the “political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality.”
New global deal needed
Hobbs said: “We need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality. As a first step world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990.
“From tax havens to weak employment laws, the richest benefit from a global economic system which is rigged in their favour. It is time our leaders reformed the system so that it works in the interests of the whole of humanity rather than a global elite.”
Closing tax havens – which hold as much as $32 trillion or a third of all global wealth – could yield an additional $189bn in additional tax revenues. In addition to a tax haven crackdown, elements of a global new deal could include:
a reversal of the trend towards more regressive forms of taxation;
a global minimum corporation tax rate;
measures to boost wages compared with returns available to capital;
increased investment in free public services and safety nets.
An off-duty police officer allegedly fired their gun by accident after setting it on a toilet paper dispenser Saturday in a bathroom stall at a Honolulu Target store, according to television station KHON.
The station reported that sources said the officer removed their Glock from its holster, placed it on top of the dispenser and accidentally pulled the trigger when they went to pick it up.
The bullet went through the wall of the stall, ricocheted off a door frame and hit the wall of an adjacent stall but, according to the Honolulu Star Advertiser, no injuries resulted from the shot.
The newspaper reported the officer, who's name was not released, has been with the Honolulu Police Department for two years and was the one to call 911 to report the shooting.
Similar incidents involving toilet paper dispensers and guns have recently happened elsewhere in the U.S.
In July, a loaded gun was found on top of a toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom of a South Carolina Wal-Mart. Similarly, in September 2013, a Missouri House staffer allegedly left their loaded pistol on top of a toilet paper dispenser at the state Capitol. Also last year, a man in Kentucky was injured when their gun fell off a toilet paper dispenser and shot them in the leg.
A Russian politician says they have been badly beaten after publicizing the funerals of two soldiers who may have died while fighting in Ukraine.
Lev Shlosberg, a newspaper publisher who represents the liberal opposition Yabloko party in the regional assembly in the northwestern city of Pskov, said they were attacked late on August 29 near their home.
"They attacked me from behind, I did not see any of them," Shlosberg told media from their hospital ward on August 30.
Shlosberg's paper published the investigation into the funerals of two Pskov-based paratroopers last week.
The report added to a trail of evidence suggesting that Russian soldiers have been killed in eastern Ukraine, contradicting denials by Moscow that it is lending military support to separatist rebels there.

The fire was reported at 0330 am (0130 UTC) on Monday morning from Rockensussra, a part of Ebeleben in Thuringia, where apartment blocks had been readied for housing refugees. Three of the blocks had caught fire and the roofs had collapsed. No one was hurt in the blaze.
Police said there was no possibility of a technical fault because all three roofs had been damaged equally. The State Office of Criminal Investigation had begun examining possible motives for arson.
The Ebeleben administration was preparing for taking in more refugees and had therefore prepared the apartment blocks. The owner of the houses said there was space for 30 refugees initially, and officials were planning to discuss the arrangement with Ebeleben's city council on Monday.
However, the blaze had made the living quarters uninhabitable.
"All three roofs have been damaged so badly, that no one can move in right now," local government spokesperson Heinz-Ulrich Thiele told journalists.
A 'cowardly' attack
Thuringia's chief minister Bodo Ramelow condemned the incident in Ebeleben, calling it a "cowardly" attack. People setting fire to migrant shelters were no different from terrorists in the countries from where refugees were fleeing, they added. "These are fire attacks on the basic values of our society," Ramelow told listeners in an interview to German radio broadcaster "Deutschlandfunk."
The fire in Ebeleben follows shortly after a blaze at a migrant shelter in Baden-Württemberg's Rottenburg injured six persons, also on Monday morning. Two refugees suffered fractures after jumping out of the building's windows to escape the fire.
"We know that it is highly possible that the fire began inside the countainer," Karlheinz Neuscheler of the Tübingen district council told reporters.
Monday's incidents follow a series of fires that have broken out in migrant accommodations in Germany in the last few months. Many cases involved targeted attacks against refugees.
Germany has however have been largely welcoming of migrants. Groups of people have been turning out at railway stations and refugee shelters to offer food, drinks and toys for the asylum seekers.

A man was shot at Rosengård district mall today, a known crime hotspot in one of Sweden's many so-called ‘no go zones' — migrant ghettoes.
The offender, who shot a man in the leg after an apparent brawl in the Rosengård shopping mall in Malmo, Sweden is still at large and is being pursued by police dog units and mounted officers. A force spokesperson on the scene told press: “it is messy in there, a man has been shot — probably in the leg. They have been taken to hospital”.
A witness to the shooting told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that the victim had their wounds dressed in a patisserie. They were apparently shot after a “fight” in the shopping mall.
The alarm was raised around 1720 BST. As is normal for Sweden, no description of the sought attacker whatsoever was released. This practice emerged last year because the force wanted to avoid being accused of racism for always seeking individuals fitting a similar non-Swedish ethnic profile.
While some media outlets have connected the attack to the apparent wave of terrorism presently sweeping Europe, today's attack — which has been classified by police as attempted murder — is merely the latest in a long line of gun crimes in a country where violent migrant gangs routinely use guns and grenades to settle disputes.
Breitbart London visited the Rosengård district, and the same central mall complex as today's attack during a September 2015 investigation into the Europe migrant crisis and accompanying crime wave. Fuelled by easy access to automatic assault weapons and grenades from former-Soviet Eastern European countries easily smuggled through Europe's open borders, Malmo acquired the nickname of “Sweden's Chicago” for its violent gun crime.
Rosengård's police station used to be in the same mall where today's shooting took place, but after it was found to be insufficiently bullet and bombproof following attacks the location was moved to a new, state of the art fortress in the town. When Breitbart London visited the station and the rest of Rosengård was a completely police-free zone.
Breitbart London spoke to former Malmo police Chief Superintendent Torsten Elofsson while visiting the city and they said crime in the city had increased out of all proportion over their last 20 years, blaming Europe's freedom of movement laws which “has also brought criminality here… Gun and drug related crime has definitely increased. Until recently the possession of guns by criminals was very rare – now finding people with firearms is a daily occurrence here… most of the guns we seize are used in criminal activity, are held illegally, and are smuggled into Sweden”.
Facebook profiles don't die the same way people do. If I Die is a Facebook app that makes sure, even if you die, your social self can still send out your last wishes and post messages to your friends years after you're gone.
If I Die lets "you" post a final message to your wall and loved one when you're dead. After installing the app, you choose three "trustees" (Facebook friends) who are charged with verifying your death. Users can then record videos or craft any number of Facebook posts to be published posthumously. When your trustees confirm your death, your messages can be published all at once to your Facebook wall or released on a designated schedule.
It might be a little morbid to start recording farewell messages, but Wilook, the Israel-based company behind the app, built the app because nobody really knows when death will come: "We all have things to say and don't necessarily have the audience with the patience to hear us," says Eran Alfonta, the app's co-founder and CEO. "Actually we all want to leave something behind, we all want to leave a stamp behind us."
Alfonta got the idea when two of their married friends traveled to Italy without their children and narrowly escaped a fatal car crash with a truck. "They stopped aside and drank water and relaxed and started speaking between themselves: 'Oh my god, what would happen to the kids if something happened to me?'" They asked Alfonta to create a website where they could record something secret to their kids that would only be sent if they died.
People have been leaving posthumous messages for a long time. Why should a Facebook app replace pen and paper or a recorded video? Facebook provided a way to verify your death with "trustees" but it also guaranteed a delivery mechanism. Too many times a letter can sit unread in a desk, but If I Die ensures a message reaches its destination.
It also allows messages to come out on a schedule. For example, when one user was diagnosed with cancer, they started recording videos for their daughter to be posted on their birthday every year until they were 18.
In a way, If I Die gives its users a measure of social media immortality. Even when they die, their profiles can live on, posting comments and sending personal messages for as long as they have messages to send.
If I Die currently only publishes to a user's public profile, but the team is working on features to allow for discrete messages and even messages that can be sent to people not on Facebook. The public postings will be free to use, though the discrete messages will work on an annual subscription model, Alfonta says.

While the team is tight-lipped on how many users it has, Alfonta said they expected to hit 100,000 users within a couple of months. Death is clearly on our social minds and Alfonta is no exception. "Oh my god, yes," they say, when asked if he's used If I Die to record their own parting messages. "I have four kids and a lovely wife and I left each one of them a message. I hope to live long and prosper but if something happens to me then I think there will be some excellent surprises for my kids, some touching messages."
Would you record a message? Do you want your profile posting messages on your behalf — even after you die?
Indiana Governor Mike Pence has apologized after a series of pro-gay marriage remarks were deleted from their official Facebook page by staff members.
Pence, a Republican who has long opposed same-sex marriage, said the move went beyond their office's internal policy of removing profane, inflammatory or uncivil comments, according to the Indianapolis Star.
“On careful review, it (appears)...some comments were being deleted simply because they expressed disagreement with my position,” Pence said in a statement on their Facebook page. “I regret that this occurred and sincerely apologize to all those who were affected.”
They added: “In agreement or disagreement, I respect the opinions and the freedoms of all the people of Indiana.”
Screengrabs of Pence's Facebook page as it appeared June 26 show some of the comments which were removed:
Most of the remarks were posted after Pence had responded to the Supreme Court's June 26 rulings on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and California's Prop 8.
“I believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman and is a unique institution worth defending in our state and nation," they wrote at the time. "For thousands of years, marriage has served as the glue that holds families and societies together and so it should ever be."
Here at RJMetrics, we've been expanding, refining and refactoring our software since the early days, but in the past year or so, we've made some big changes.
Our code has seen two fundamental and interrelated changes:
The introduction of Clojure into our codebase. Moving our software to an architecture composed of microservices. We're extremely pleased with the direction this is taking us, but as always, there have been new problems to solve along the way.
When we began to think about how to break our system down, we saw that decoupling our databases from data access logic was going to be a roadblock early on. In order to be of any use, new services would need to be able to interact with the data models that live at the heart of our application. This includes entities such as charts, dashboards, users, and a whole host of others that define the state of our system.
At the time, all of the logic that understood how those entities were represented in databases was written in PHP. Any new services we built on another platform had no means to reuse it. We decided that logic needed to move out on its own and expose a clean, consistent, platform-agnostic interface to allow reuse. On the way to realizing that goal, we developed a library.
Meet Sweet-Liberty the Library
Sweet-Liberty is a Clojure library designed to simplify the process of building services that:
Manage data stores and, Expose a consistent RESTful API.
You can think of it as a means to build and configure components that translate (both ways!) between REST and SQL. Or, you might say that it helps you wrap a REST interface around a relational database. You can find it here on github
Here's a very simplified explanation of what it can do.
1. A service built with Sweet-Liberty receives an HTTP request.
GET /dogs 1 GET / dogs
2. Sweet-Liberty translates the request into a SQL query.
SELECT `id`, `name`, `breed` FROM `dogs` 1 SELECT ` id ` , ` name ` , ` breed ` FROM ` dogs `
3. Executing the SQL yields a result set.
+----------+----------+--------------+ | id | name | breed | +----------+----------+--------------+ | 1 | Fido | dachshund | | 2 | Rex | chihuahua | | 3 | Spot | dalmatian | +----------+----------+--------------+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 + -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + | id | name | breed | + -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + | 1 | Fido | dachshund | | 2 | Rex | chihuahua | | 3 | Spot | dalmatian | + -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- +
4. Sweet-Liberty translates the result set to a JSON-formatted response and returns it to the calling code.
[{ id: 1, name: ‘Fido', breed: ‘dachshund' }, { id: 2, name: ‘Rex', breed: ‘chihuahua' }, { id: 3, name: ‘Spot', breed: ‘dalmatian' }] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 [ { id : 1 , name : ‘ Fido ' , breed : ‘ dachshund ' } , { id : 2 , name : ‘ Rex ' , breed : ‘ chihuahua ' } , { id : 3 , name : ‘ Spot ' , breed : ‘ dalmatian ' } ]
But, wait! There's more!
Endpoints
An endpoint powered by Sweet-Liberty provides a number of operations by default. These can be accessed via query parameters in the request URL. Operations can by used in conjunction.
Examples of each operation are below. Each shows a URL, the resulting SQL and (for the first two) a result set in json.
Request only a subset of fields using the _fields argument.
GET /dogs?_fields=id&_fields=name SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `dogs` [{id : 1, name : ‘Fido'}, {id : 2, name ‘Rex'}] 1 2 3 4 5 6 GET / dogs ? _ fields = id & _ fields = name SELECT ` id ` , ` name ` FROM ` dogs ` [ { id : 1 , name : ‘ Fido ' } , { id : 2 , name ‘ Rex ' } ]
Filter results to only return those that meet some condition.
GET /dogs?breed=corgi SELECT `id`, `name`, `breed` FROM `dogs`WHERE `breed` = “corgi” [{id : 2, name : ‘Lacy', breed : ‘corgi'}, {id : 6, name : ‘Brody', breed : ‘corgi'}] 1 2 3 4 5 6 GET / dogs ? breed = corgi SELECT ` id ` , ` name ` , ` breed ` FROM ` dogs ` WHERE ` breed ` = “ corgi ” [ { id : 2 , name : ‘ Lacy ' , breed : ‘ corgi ' } , { id : 6 , name : ‘ Brody ' , breed : ‘ corgi ' } ]
The paging query parameters can be used to sort and divide the collection of records into pages and return only the page requested.
GET /dogs?_page=3&_pageitems=10&_pagekey=breed&_pageorder=asc SELECT `id`, `name`, `breed` FROM `dogs` ORDER BY `breed` ASC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 GET / dogs ? _ page = 3 & _ pageitems = 10 & _ pagekey = breed & _ pageorder = asc SELECT ` id ` , ` name ` , ` breed ` FROM ` dogs ` ORDER BY ` breed ` ASC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
Additionally, the query parameters above can be used in combination.
You can find a full example application here for a service that manages dogs. Below are two excerpts from the core.clj in that project. These two snippets fully specify everything that is unique to the service — the configuration and the routes. In total, these clock in just under 50 lines of code, not too bad.
Configuration Map
The configuration map is where you specify each of the tables your service will manage, as well as their respective field lists. There are several other options that can also be configured such as default filters, name transformations, and pre- and post- execution conditions, but I'm sticking with the default behavior to keep this clear and simple.
(def config "Sweet-Liberty config values" {:dogs {:table {:table-name :dogs :attributes [:id :name :breed] :primary-key :id}}} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ( def config "Sweet-Liberty config values" { : dogs { : table { : table-name : dogs : attributes [ : id : name : breed ] : primary-key : id } } }
Routes
The other critical piece is the routes. This example uses the Compojure library to provide an interface for defining routes. The code below defines three routes. The first two handle GET and POST requests to the collection endpoint (ie /dogs). The last one handles all requests to the entity endpoint (ie /dogs/1).
Ultimately, we hand a liberator resource value over to compojure. This resource is built by the make-resource function, which take a sweet-lib configuration map as its only argument. The expression threads the initial base configuration through a series of sweet-lib functions, each one making changes along the way.
Each change specifies some additional details about how the route will respond to requests. For example, “(sl/add-exists :id)” adds a handler that will use the “id” field of the resource to determine whether it already *exists* in the database before any further processing.
Because the amended map is exposed after each successive call, you are able to make other, custom modifications if necessary. The door is open for extensibility here.
(defroutes app (GET "/dogs" [] (-> {:options (assoc (:dogs config) :db-spec db-spec :return-exceptions? true) :liberator-config liberator-config} sl/add-exists sl/add-get (sl/add-ok-handler :collection? true) ;; Sweet-Liberty requires that you explicitly set the authorization ;; handler. It is for your own good. The following line sets the ;; route to allow all requests -- ie the route is open to the public. (sl/add-authorization (constantly true)) sl/make-resource)) (POST "/dogs" [] (-> {:options (assoc (:dogs config) :db-spec db-spec) :liberator-config liberator-config} (sl/add-exists :id) (sl/add-ok-handler :collection? true) sl/add-post sl/add-created-handler (sl/add-authorization (constantly true)) sl/make-resource)) (GET "/dogs/:id" [id] (-> {:options (assoc (:dogs config) :db-spec db-spec :url-params {:id id}) :liberator-config liberator-config} (sl/add-exists :id) sl/add-get (sl/add-ok-handler :collection? false) (sl/add-authorization (constantly true)) sl/make-resource)) (PUT "/dogs/:id" [id] (-> {:options (assoc (:dogs config) :db-spec db-spec :url-params {:id id}) :liberator-config liberator-config} (sl/add-exists :id) (sl/add-ok-handler :collection? false) (sl/add-put :id) (sl/add-authorization (constantly true)) sl/make-resource)) (route/not-found "Cannot find route")) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 ( defroutes app ( GET "/dogs" [ ] ( -> { : options ( assoc ( : dogs config ) : db-spec db-spec : return -exceptions ? true ) : liberator-config liberator-config } sl / add-exists sl / add-get ( sl / add-ok-handler : collection ? true ) ;; Sweet-Liberty requires that you explicitly set the authorization ;; handler. It is for your own good. The following line sets the ;; route to allow all requests -- ie the route is open to the public. ( sl / add-authorization ( constantly true ) ) sl / make -resource ) ) ( POST "/dogs" [ ] ( -> { : options ( assoc ( : dogs config ) : db-spec db-spec ) : liberator-config liberator-config } ( sl / add-exists : id ) ( sl / add-ok-handler : collection ? true ) sl / add-post sl / add-created-handler ( sl / add-authorization ( constantly true ) ) sl / make -resource ) ) ( GET "/dogs/:id" [ id ] ( -> { : options ( assoc ( : dogs config ) : db-spec db-spec : url-params { : id id } ) : liberator-config liberator-config } ( sl / add-exists : id ) sl / add-get ( sl / add-ok-handler : collection ? false ) ( sl / add-authorization ( constantly true ) ) sl / make -resource ) ) ( PUT "/dogs/:id" [ id ] ( -> { : options ( assoc ( : dogs config ) : db-spec db-spec : url-params { : id id } ) : liberator-config liberator-config } ( sl / add-exists : id ) ( sl / add-ok-handler : collection ? false ) ( sl / add-put : id ) ( sl / add-authorization ( constantly true ) ) sl / make -resource ) ) ( route / not -found "Cannot find route" ) )
How to use it
The library is available on clojars at:
[com.rjmetrics.developers/sweet-liberty “0.1.1”] 1 [ com . rjmetrics . developers / sweet-liberty “ 0.1.1 ” ]
The example application is a good place to start. Check it out on github. It includes a namespace that will examine the Sweet Liberty configuration and build an in-memory database on the fly. This isn't appropriate in a production scenario, but it makes it easy to jump in and play around.
I take great pleasure in slashing boilerplate code through abstraction. This is our attempt to do that for RESTful services written in Clojure. I'm excited by our early progress so far. I hope others will find it useful in their own projects and maybe even join in to help grow this into something even better.

Finally something that I can agree with a Marxist on, Finns need to produce more children if they don't want their population to contract any further, and forced to open their borders to even more people who couldn't care less to be cultural Finns.
So of course their fellow marxists are outraged, how can they call for more open borders if Finns are having enough babies? So I advise everyone who's not a marxist to out populate these regressive reject morons and save ourselves.
Antti Rinne, 54, urges Finnish people to “give birth”, SDP colleagues appalled and outraged over word choice
THE SOCIAL Democratic Party urges Finns to make more children. On Wednesday , Antti Rinne, chairperson of the party, encouraged Finns to “give birth” when speaking at the Sdp Parliamentary Group's summer meeting in Kouvola.
“This year, for the first time in Finland, there are fewer than 50,000 children than in the 1860s famine years. This is a very serious thing. No nation can develop better unless its future is safeguarded by new generations. ” For six years now,
FERTILITY has declined in Finland. In 2016, 52645 children were born, the smallest age group throughout their independence. In 2015, children were born 2827 more than last year.
Overall fertility was 1.57 last year. The total fertility rate tells how many children a woman would give birth during their lifetime if age-specific fertility rates remained at the year of computation.
RINNE calls for a comprehensive family policy strategy for Finland and reminds that at the time of the birth of the baby boom families were encouraged to make a child with an advert “the fourth patriot”. According to Rinne, half of that amount would be “a remarkable improvement”.
“It goes without saying that the parties do not decide what to do in the bedroom, but we can eliminate people's concerns about setting up a family.”
The father of two children Rinne, 54, promised to list on Thursday the second day of the day the birth rate in Finland will rise. They are related, among other things, to day care and parental leave.

A tuition war of sorts is underway in southern Ontario and the State of Michigan.
First, the University of Windsor announced lower tuition for American students.
Now, Detroit's Wayne State University has followed suit and is offering a similar incentive for students from Ontario and the neighbouring Great Lakes States.
Out-of-state undergrads, including those from Ontario, who qualify for the tuition award at Wayne State will pay the same tuition as Michigan students, plus 10 per cent.
So, a student who takes 15 credit hours per semester can save about $11,000 US dollars a year.
Wayne State's provost said it's a way to curb falling enrollment and make the university better known outside Southeast Michigan.
Also, we want our students to meet and work with and live with a more diverse student body," Wayne State provost Margaret Winters said.
University of Windsor staff isn't yet concerned by the discount being offered just across the Detroit River.
"It's a positive thing for Windsor-Essex that we're both dedicated to the region," assistant vice president of recruitment and enrollment Dave Bussiere said.
Michigan students attending the University of Windsor now pay about $10,000 US for two semesters.
"But our old rate for that same U.S. student would have been around $18,000 US," Bussiere said.
The University of Windsor slashed tuition fees for its U.S. students in May. It called it "a good-neighbour gesture."
This fall semester marked the beginning of the discounted rates.
Bussiere said it's too early to tell how effective it's been. There are only 50 U.S. undergrads across all programs but they expect that to quadruple by next fall.
They said it recognizes that Michigan is part of the university's region.
"Because it's much cheaper for us to recruit in Michigan than it is in China, India, Africa and so forth," they said.
Bussiere called the Wayne State program "comparable" to Windsor's, but points out that it's still more expensive for a Canadian to go across the river for university.
This is a very boring, simple explanation as to why the NFL's ratings are declining. It is not an opportunity for you to shoehorn in your feelings about Colin Kaepernick protesting the game. No one really cares about your feelings about Colin Kaepernick's protest, because if you are the kind of person who gets really offended by Colin Kaepernick's protest, then your feelings in 2017 are the most boring and predictable thing about you, and telling on you in a deeply unflattering light.
The simpler and also boring systemic problem with the NFL that might actually explain something is its success, and how that success made the ownership class in the NFL fat, lazy, and locked into a business model they have no real reason or incentive to change, even with falling TV ratings.
The absence of real risk of failure is a start. Stakeholders in the NFL cannot lose—at least not under the league's current structure. Owners split money from the league's massive TV deals and other media revenue streams. That stream is so dependable, so huge, and so guaranteed that it's done what large, intractable pools of cash have done since the invention of markets. It has altered and distorted the very thing that created it, and broken the basic exchange between consumer and seller that made the NFL successful in the first place.
It's a form of laziness, and a special kind different from the standard laziness in the NFL. Laziness bred from prosperity isn't a new problem for NFL ownership and management. For every old-school Rooney or Mara or Hunt family intent on making at least an honest show of competing, producing a good product, and paying at least paltry attention to the demands of the consumer, there has been a Culverhouse or a Smith, owners who ran their franchises with the least possible effort and expenditure. The slumlords of the NFL took their rent, often without providing anything close to a finished building.
Note: This may be literally true of the 1970s and 1980s Buccaneers, whose stadium sort of looked like concrete that never set exactly right, so they just went with it and said, “yeah, it's supposed to be shaped like a melted frisbee.” What you call a mistake, the 1970s called architecture.
That approach towards maximizing your dollar with the bare minimum of effort became more sophisticated over time. As the league's revenues boomed, they became something less like points of civic pride run as passion projects by the locally wealthy, and something more like attractive investment properties with a promising rate of return for billionaires — particularly those billionaires who entered the NFL as strangers to the league, but as intimate familiars of a corporate culture dependent on squeezing every profitable dollar, and trimming every wasteful one from the budget.
For instance: The legend of Dan Snyder tells a story of someone who was “passionate” about the Washington franchise on a personal level. It sometimes leaves out their ruthless economizing of the franchise, a focus on the bottom line interrupted periodically by splashing free agent signings to keep fans semi-interested in the team. That they keep them in the worst stadium in the league, charges for everything short of oxygen, and rolls out a consistently mediocre product doesn't matter: Their great gift as an NFL owner, after nearly 20 years, has turned out to be a deep understanding of knowing exactly how little actual quality they could slip into the product without breaking the customer's dependence completely.*
*Side note: Dan Snyder would be an amazing MDMA dealer.
That level of sophisticated coasting in the name of profitability became a laudable thing for owners. Jerry Jones, in particular, emphasized profitability and value for the league, leaning hard on new television contracts, stadium deals, corporate tie-ins, and whatever else they could grab in order to boost the value of the Cowboys to its limit. The momentum for moving the Raiders — one of the league's oldest recognizable brands, with one of its most insanely loyal fanbases — from Oakland to Las Vegas came largely from Jones, and mostly for the holy grail of profitability. Jones is the crowning example of the NFL's gargantuan gains in the financial weight room: Since buying the Cowboys for $140 million in 1989, Jones has grown the value of the franchise to $4.2 billion. The team makes a publicly declared $227 million a year.
The NFL was able to do this because, at a certain point, wealth outstrips the power of the assets that created it. In 2017, the league split over $7.8 billion between teams. The money and the success the league enjoyed became so huge that they attained their own gravity, and became separate from the main product that built the league in the first place: professional football.
That separation of the product from the wealth it creates should be familiar to any American consumer. A large company takes control of an entire economy, becomes so large it cannot fail, and thus has no real incentive to do anything but seek rent on that endless, belching pipeline of cash. The product produced generally does not improve, and often without the pressure of competition doesn't have to improve at all. It might even get worse, or at least watch things like customer service and satisfaction take nosedives.
It's not exactly a monopoly, but it's also not-not exactly a monopoly, either.
The value in that kind of behavior doesn't come from the product. That flatlined in terms of utility a long, long time ago. (The Patriots remain unusual for not only trying, but trying intelligently to produce a good product.) An NFL owner no longer needs that to continue to boost the value of the franchise using anything that happens on the field. Value comes from getting a new stadium someone else paid for, moving the franchise to a more valuable piece of real estate and doubling the value of the franchise overnight. Value comes from leveraging and re-leveraging your existing assets, not by creating anything new.
If you see an NFL franchise as just another asset to be maximized and squeezed for every dime, being good at football — i.e. producing a good product — doesn't matter. It's not even rational to put effort towards anything but “value creation,” i.e. shuffling around pieces of the franchise until they sit in the most profitable positions. The Rams doubled their value overnight by leaving St. Louis and moving to L.A. They are a miserable football team run by a despised owner playing in an empty stadium, but the Rams could care less. The fourth most valuable team in the NFL sucks by design, and shines bright enough on the balance sheet to eliminate any real concerns about how bad the product is on the field.
The Rams, the 49ers, and the Washington team are all in the top 10 most valuable NFL franchises. There are other reasons for that besides their efficient disinterest in making a good on-field product — the real estate and cost of doing business in expensive places like L.A., the Bay Area, and D.C. being a huge one — but the lesson for anyone acquiring an NFL team as an asset is pretty clear. Strip the place to the frame, gorge on TV money, and only do the bare minimum to keep people interested.
That distancing of the product — and its overall quality as an experience — from revenue makes for a dysfunctional exchange between the consumer and the producer.
What does that mean, exactly? It means that because the Rams don't have to worry about quality, they can slog into the Coliseum, wait for a new stadium to be built, and bill themselves as a content company while playing in front of hundreds of bored fans. It means that being good, for a lot of teams, is an accident, or a periodic spasm to regain fan interest spaced between long troughs of minimal effort.
*The NFL is you at work! Congrats, you too could be America's most successful sports enterprise.
This explains why the NFL now functions less like an open market business, and more like a cartel. (Not a cartel exactly, economics pedants, but cartel-ish.)
A cartel really doesn't care what you want. It knows what you need, and has it. All behaviors from that point forward only protect the cartel and its control of supply and delivery. There will be no innovation, no new ideas not in service of that maintenance of revenue streams, and no serious competition between cartel members. In fact, they'll all cut the quality of the product wherever possible to take home the most possible cash.
The NFL isn't alone in this in sports, and not even in football, either. The disease of guaranteed revenue has bitten college football, too. Texas, the most profitable athletic program in the nation, is a prime example of the strange incentives huge profits can create within a sports franchise. The more money the program makes, the less consistent or important the quality of the product has been to the priorities of those at the top running the cash machine.
But as the most popular sport in America — and one that pools profits — it is the most visible, and most visibly prone to this leveling by the demands of the spreadsheet. Even a distancing by slight degrees, like turning your basic exchange from one of fans opting into an experience into one of a television product given to captive subscribers, is enough to change how ownership behaves.
There is a structural reason live audiences aren't even necessary anymore: Ticket sales make up such a shrinking percentage of team revenue that the Rams and 49ers might as well play on sound stages, if you think they don't already. The distance between the sport and the mammoth business it built will only grow, and in that space will be those who loved the NFL, but now watch the condensed version of the NFL on RedZone, and those who make it begrudgingly while looking to the next successful investment opportunity.
That next something might be something like eSports, which the owner of the Patriots just dropped $20 million on via investment in an Overwatch league. When will we know eSports made it? When there are commercial breaks after load screens, fights over gaming arenas being paid for with public money, and a class of owner looking for nothing more than the next grandiose and guaranteed font of cash. eSports is lucky, for the moment: Kraft seems to enjoy making a quality product. It's when the Haslams and Stan Kroenke* show up that gamers should panic.
*Okay, go ahead and panic, gamers. Stan Kroenke is already there.
Porn mogul Berth Milton Jr. is pushing hotels to offer free board to sexual exhibitionists . Ladies and gentlemen, this is a glimpse of our future, as the digital age leans more on the content creation of the consumers themselves. Milton's idea just might work, too.
According to the New York Post, the concept is simple:
Offer two or more people a free night's stay
Film them having sex
Sell the content to customers in the hotel and online
Judgments aside, the idea is no different thanand, orand. For social networks, customers are given a free platform to express themselves and their expressions are what drive more customers to the site and, ideally, propel their ad-based model. (To paraphrase a chilling line in The Social Network , "We don't have to steal their information because they are going to voluntarily give it to us.") Similarly, upload sites like YouTube or I Can Have Cheezeburger give virtual kudos, in the forms of views and votes, for the "best" of the bunch. It isn't impossible to imagine some couples taking pride in making one of the most ordered or highest ranked videos.
Milton says hotels could make as much as $43.8 million in additional revenues from implementing the idea, and while the porn industry is infamous for inflating numbers, there is definitely a neglected profit center here.
First, hotels already make a killing on traditional pornography. According to Eric Schlosser's excellent subculture economics book Reefer Madness:
Indeed, about half of all the films rented in hotel rooms are porn films. The leading hotel chains -- such as Hilton, Holiday Inn, Sheraton, and Marriott International -- get a cut of up to 15 percent.
Second, to my knowledge, no mainstream hotel has actually made its pay per view content available online. As noted in the CBS News documentary Porn In The U.S.A. , most hotel chains are understandably sheepish about revealing how much they depend on pornography, but a rebellious upstart -- like aorof hotels -- could totally revolutionize the traditional revenue model. The only thing on the line would be their reputation.
Third, it's already happening on a smaller scale. According to Museum of Sex curator Sarah Forbes, the Prague-based brothel Big Sister (link not safe for work) has been successfully using a similar online distribution model for profit.
It's hard to see Milton's model working well within the United States aside from, perhaps, places like San Francisco, New York, Miami, New Orleans, or Portland, where sex norms are more liberal and experimentation is expected. It could very well thrive in the rest of the world, however, and its viability makes it more than just another gimmick.

Ron Rivera wants to get through Carolina's season finale at Tampa Bay on New Year's Day before they reflect on what went wrong in 2016. But the Panthers coach on Monday did drop a couple of hints that changes will be coming in 2017.
“You have to evolve. Things are going to change after six seasons,” Rivera said. “When this is all done, we'll take a look back at some things and see what we've got to do as we go forward.”
At best, the Panthers will win eight fewer games than they did last season. It's by far the steepest fall ever for a team coming off 15 wins, and it continues the franchise's now 22-year-old inability to put together back-to-back winning seasons.
Injuries have played a part, but they also muddle the gray area between excuses and everything else that didn't go well.
First and foremost, general manager Dave Gettleman can be accused of resting on their laurels this offseason. He, of course, hasn't answered questions about the makeup of their roster since August, and it will be interesting to see if they admit to mistakes or regrets during their postseason press conference next week.
Secondly, the offense and quarterback Cam Newton regressed badly. The Panthers, who led the league with 31.2 points per game during Newton's MVP-winning season, are 14th in scoring with a 23.5 average.
Set to shatter career lows in completion percentage (52.7 percent) and passer rating (77.5), Newton deserves blame for their disappointing season. But just like injuries aren't a one-size-fits-all excuse, he's not the sole reason for their decline.
Because you'd never fire the reigning MVP and your most important player, others around them are vulnerable. The offense has been broken for most of this season, which means coordinator Mike Shula and/or quarterbacks coach Ken Dorsey are the most likely fall guys.
“There are a lot of things that we're going to look at,” Rivera said. “We understand and we get that there are some things that have to evolve around them because he's evolving as a quarterback, as well. He's getting older and he's going to be a different style player. We know that much.”
For what it's worth, the Panthers have cut back on centering so much of their offense on Newton's ability to run. But while their 87 attempts and 353 yards are well below the fewest of their career, this year's ‘evolution' has instead been a big step backward for the entire unit.
Fiercely loyal, it's too early to know what changes Rivera will be willing to make. But even if owner Jerry Richardson and Gettleman have to chime in, changes are coming.
“I believe this is a blip,” Rivera said.
“If you don't learn from this, then you've wasted it. I know that it hasn't been what we expected, what I expected. But I do know this — I'm going to learn from it, I'm going to grow from it and we'll be better.”
Fears of government limits on guns — some real, some perceived — led to a surge in demand during President Obama's tenure, and manufacturers like Daniel Defense in Georgia leapt to keep up.
WEBSTER, Texas — President Trump promised to revive US manufacturing, but there's one once-burgeoning sector poised to shrink under their watch: the gun industry.
Fears of government limits on guns — some real, some perceived — led to a surge in demand during President Obama's tenure, and manufacturers leapt to keep up. Over the decade ending in 2015, the number of US companies licensed to make firearms jumped a whopping 362 percent. But sales are down and the bubble appears to be bursting with a staunch advocate for gun rights in the White House and Republicans ruling Congress.
‘‘The trends really almost since Election Day or election night have been that gun sales have slacked off,'' said Robert Spitzer, political science department chairperson at State University of New York at Cortland. ‘‘When you take away Barack Obama and you give the Republicans control of both houses of Congress, which is extremely friendly to the gun lobby, then the political pressure subsides. And that surely is at least a key part of the explanation for the drop-off in sales.''

The pendulum swing is not lost on employees of outfits such as Battle Rifle Co., a small enterprise tucked into a nondescript strip mall outside Houston, with a storefront section featuring cases filled with handguns and walls lined with assault-rifle-style long guns. The manufacturing floor and its eight employees, all veterans of the military or law enforcement, occupy the back.

‘‘President Obama was the best gun salesperson the world has ever seen,'' said production manager Karl Sorken, an Army veteran and self-described liberal who voted for Obama and notes the change for the industry under Trump is a topic of conversation in the shop.
‘‘You might have people who were more inclined to buy because they were worried they might not be able to later. That's going away for sure,'' they said. ‘‘But by the same token, the shooting sports in this country are going to explode because they're not going to be as worried or restricted about how they can shoot, where they can shoot.''
There are nearly 10,500 gunmakers in the country, many of them founded since 2000, said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Experts say many are drawn to long guns, in part because sales for them rose after a Clinton-era ban on assault weapons expired in 2004 and politicians' threats to restrict them drove demand. At the same time, shooting sports grew in popularity, and returning veterans sought out weapons with which they became comfortable in Iraq and Afghanistan.
From 2004 to 2013, sales of all handguns — pistols and revolvers — increased nearly fivefold, according to industry figures. Sales of rifles tripled in that timeframe.

Battle Rifle took shape in the middle of that surge, formed in 2010 after its founder Chris Kurzadkowski ventured into their garage to build their police officer son a rifle from scratch.
Now, the retail store in the front of their shop has a cozy seating area, a TV and coffee with such names as AK-47 Espresso Blend. The craftsmanship happens out back, where the all-male crew brings a love of long guns, the Second Amendment, precision and a bit of artistry to creating custom-made rifles.
Battle sells about seven each week. Prices range from around $700 to as much as $4,000, depending on accessories, specifications and custom paint jobs. Some 60 percent of its weapons are sold to police officers.
Lisa Marie Pane/Associated Press Karl Sorken, production manager for Battle Rifle Co. in Webster, Texas, worked on the rails of an AR-15 style rifle.
Country music and conservative talk radio waft through the cavernous shop where guns are made and used ones repaired. The ribbing among the tight-knit group is constant, but when it turns serious, the men describe their work as something that transcends simple labor.
‘‘Our forefathers realized what tyranny does and if you don't have a way to protect yourself from tyranny then you become a subject,'' said ammunition expert Jamey Spears, who spent five years in Texas law enforcement until they were shot during a raid on a Dallas crack house. The .45-caliber hollow point bullet that went through a gap in their body armor remains lodged next to their spine, a noticeable lump reminding them of how close they came to dying that day.

‘‘I have nothing but the most heartfelt adoration for people who serve so others can be safe,'' they said.
One reason for the surge in manufacturers of AR-platform firearms — called ‘‘modern sporting rifles'' by the industry — is that they are not protected by patents or trademarks. That makes it an open field for anyone with a federal license.
Another has been demand helped by a monied clientele. The majority of AR owners are male, with half between the ages of 45 and 64, and more than half reporting annual income of more than $75,000, according to a 2013 survey conducted for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers.
Daniel Defense, a company based in Black Creek, Georgia, about 25 miles west of Savannah, capitalized on the growth in interest in AR-platform weapons. It began in 2000 by making parts for AR-style firearms. Last year, Daniel sold 60,000 complete weapons.
Founder Marty Daniel, who employs about 300 workers and is more than doubling their manufacturing facility's square footage, said they were prepared for the dips in sales and anticipates those will last through the year. But they consider the downturn part of a natural business cycle, like those in the housing market.
‘‘There are some blips in there from time to time. And we're in one of those because Trump was elected,'' Daniel said. But, they say, ‘‘it's not gloom and doom.''
At Battle Rifle, Sorken said he's confident the industry will stay on the upswing, even if not at the rate seen in recent years.
‘‘In this country, the gun culture is so strong I'm not worried about it going anywhere,'' Sorken said.
If there's been any identifiable theme coming out of Donald Trump's disastrous few weeks of campaigning, it's that more and more Americans are fed up with their anti-immigrant rhetoric.
“Coming from a troubled place does not mean that we are criminals,” Abdifatah Ahmed said to loud cheers at a Friday protest in Portland, where at least 4,000 Somalis live. “So we will stay here, and, you know, in November we will vote.” The City Hall demonstration attracted about 400 people and included chants of “more love, no hate,” and signs that read “I love my neighbors” and “No place for racism.” Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling, who tucked a copy of the Constitution in their shirt pocket, welcomed the city's Somali residents.
This is after Trump launched into yet another anti-immigrant tirade last week, this time accusing Somali Americans in Maine and Minnesota of being "a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for Islamist terror groups." Because, apparently, he'll now be honing their anti-immigrant speeches to insult individual groups in individual states as being a threat to America; that appears to be their notion of state-by-state "campaigning."
It also seems hand-tailored to drive a wedge between Trump and any remaining Republicans who want to hang on to their much-cherished "moderate" labels. Maine's Sen. Susan Collins called the statements "particularly unhelpful." So, you know, take that, Donald Trump. I'm not sure how how the big orange gasbag will ever recover from being called unhelpful.
Elsewhere, though, there's a deep anger at Trump's continued demonization of immigrants. And Trump may be in danger of turning the election into precisely what every other Republican does not want to see: a national referendum on the party's embrace of that racism.
[Hodan Hassan] said Trump's remarks breed fear in the community — and have inspired a determination to take part in the election. “Statements like that will drive people to hit the polls and vote for their opponent,” they said. “In their twisted way, they are empowering us.”
I don't think Trump can win this fight, and their persistence in trying borders on bizarre. He's predicated their campaign on the theory that he'll be able to elevate xenophobia into a dominant political movement, but that only works if none of the targets fight back. And guess what? It ain't the primaries anymore. Come November, all the folks who are not xenophobic Republican Fox News viewers get to vote too. And it won't just be Donald Trump they'll be voting against.

How Does It Work?
ORLANDO, Fla. -- From the time they celebrated that winning putt in the sudden-death playoff at Augusta National all the way to being just a few weeks from defending their title, there hardly seems to have been a day, an hour, a minute that Adam Scott has not relished being the Masters champion.
It is safe to say they have absolutely loved the experience, never having tired of talking about it, taking the green jacket all over the globe for others to see, reminiscing a million times about the final day and typically describing the events as if they were doing so for the first time.
How cool.

Not that Adam Scott needs any help in that department.
Everyone clearly enjoys their victory lap, but the Aussie makes it look like they have relished every inch of the journey. And it has been fun to watch.
Perhaps it has to do with the sporting-mad nation of Australia finally celebrating a Masters champion after a frustrating ride. Maybe it is the way Scott was understated in the week after their victory, but more than willing to show off the spoils of their victory, letting others see them in the green jacket.
It could just be that Scott, 33 -- quite private by nature -- can't help but share the experience.
"It's not hard to embrace that," Scott said after opening the Arnold Palmer Invitational with a 62 to take the first-round lead. "It's been something I've wanted a long time. So it may or may not be the one year I get to run around with the green jacket.
"It's been a lot of fun. I may as well have fun with it while I've got it. But it's been mostly what anyone talks to me about in the last 12 months since the Masters. That's what everyone is interested in. So it's not the hardest subject for me to talk about. I could spend plenty of time talking about it. I think you've got to embrace it."
They had -- beautifully. And now their game seems to be shaping up just in time, too.
Scott matched the course record held by Greg Norman, Andy Bean and Gary Player by posting two eagles, seven birdies and just one bogey while needing just 23 putts.
Perhaps this was simply a hot putting round, but Scott had talked prior to the tournament about hoping to see their game emerge as this is their last event before the Masters. Looks like they can check that box.
In recent years, Scott has altered their schedule to be better prepared for the big events. They have seen value in getting rest and peaking properly, and they have valued the traditions those tournaments hold.
The green jacket, for example.
Detroit Community Scrip Detroit Community Scrip, 3 Cheers. Denominations Nickname Detroit Cheer Banknotes Freq. used 3 Demographics User(s) Businesses in Detroit, Michigan Issuance Central bank Detroit Cheers Governing Board Valuation Pegged by US Dollar
Detroit Community Scrip, also called Detroit Cheers, is a local currency used in Detroit, Michigan.[1] Modeled upon the local scrip that were used during the Great Depression, it is being used to restore local economic confidence. The Cheers are backed by U.S. currency and are fully exchangeable for an equal amount of U.S. dollars, backed by several Detroit businesses. There are currently $4,500 worth of cheers in circulation.[2] Businesses can sign up to be issuers and print scrip after depositing a matching amount in U.S. dollars and then be entitled to print Cheers.[3] More than 25 businesses have signed up to accept Cheers, but many others informally accept them.[citation needed]
History [ edit ]
The Detroit Scrip was first issued in April 2009[3] by Foran's Grand Trunk Pub, The Park Bar or Motor City Brewing Works.[2] Including the issuers, there were 17 initial businesses accepting the Cheer.[2]
Design [ edit ]
Cheers are available in only the $3 denomination. The standardized face of the Cheer features the Spirit of Detroit over the Detroit Skyline. The back of the bill is designed by the issuing business and can vary.[4]
CTV Windsor
A long-serving Member of Parliament in Windsor will not seek re-election in the 2015 federal election.
Windsor-Tecumseh MP Joe Comartin announced their retirement Thursday morning at a news conference at Willistead Park.
“Great honour representing the citizens of Windsor-Tecumseh over the last 14 years,” Comartin said.
Comartin served five terms as the representative for Windsor-Tecumseh, beating out Liberal incumbent Rick Limoges in 2000. The current deputy speaker also served as opposition house leader from October 2011, to April 2012.
“You have taught me the spirit of community prevails in even the most distressing economic times. I feel blessed to be able to say, you have allowed me to make a contribution to make betterment to your lives, my city, and my country,” they said.
The next federal election is scheduled to take place on Oct. 19, 2015.
“I am forever indebted to you for the opportunity you have given me.”
Eduard Bloch (30 January 1872 – 1 June 1945) was an Austrian Jewish doctor practicing in Linz (Austria). Until 1907, Bloch was the physician of Adolf Hitler's family. Hitler later awarded Bloch special protection after the Nazi annexation of Austria.[1]
Early years [ edit ]
Bloch was born in Frauenberg (today Hluboká nad Vltavou, Czech Republic),[2] studied medicine in Prague and then served as a medical officer in the Austrian army. They were stationed in Linz from 1899 until their discharge in 1901, at which point they opened a private doctor's practice there. Their practice was in the baroque house at 12 Landstrasse, where they also lived with their family: their wife, Emilie (née Kafka) and their daughter Trude, born in 1903. According to Linz's future mayor Ernst Koref, Bloch was held in high regard, particularly among the lower and indigent social classes. It was generally known that at any time at night they were willing to call on patients. They used to go on visits in their hansom, wearing a conspicuous broad-brimmed hat. Like most Jews in Linz at the time, the Bloch family were assimilated.
Hitler family doctor [ edit ]
The first member of the Hitler family Bloch was to see was Adolf Hitler. In 1904, Hitler had become seriously ill and was bedridden due to a serious lung ailment. Due to this, they were allowed to abandon their school career and return home. However, after checking Hitler's files, Bloch later maintained that they had treated the youth for only minor ailments, cold or tonsilitis and that Hitler had been neither robust nor sickly. They also stated that Hitler did not have any illness whatsoever, let alone a lung disease.[3]
In 1907, Hitler's mother, Klara Hitler, was diagnosed with breast cancer. They died on 21 December after intense suffering involving daily medication with iodoform, a foul-smelling and painful corrosive treatment typically used at the time and administered by Bloch. Because of the poor economic situation of the Hitler family, Bloch charged reduced prices, sometimes taking no fee at all. The then 18-year-old Hitler granted them their "everlasting gratitude" for this[4] ("Ich werde Ihnen ewig dankbar sein"). This showed in 1908 when Hitler wrote Bloch a postcard assuring them of their gratitude and reverence which they expressed with handmade gifts, as for example, a large wall painting which according to Bloch's daughter Gertrude (Trude) Kren (born 1903 in Austria, died 1992 in the US) was lost in the course of time. Even in 1937, Hitler inquired about Bloch's well-being and called them an "Edeljude" ("noble Jew"). Bloch also apparently had a special fondness for the Hitler family which was to serve them well in the future.
Emigration [ edit ]
After Germany's annexation of Austria in March 1938 (Anschluss), life became harder for Austrian Jews. After Bloch's medical practice was closed on 1 October 1938, their daughter and son-in-law, Bloch's young colleague Dr. Franz Kren (born 1893 in Austria, died 1976 in the US), emigrated overseas.
The 66-year-old Bloch then wrote a letter to Hitler asking for help and was as a consequence put under special protection by the Gestapo. They were the only Jew in Linz with this status. Bloch stayed in their house with their wife undisturbed until the formalities for their emigration to the United States were completed. Without any interference from the authorities, they were able to sell their family home at market value, highly unusual with the distress sales of emigrating Jews at the time. Moreover, they were allowed to take the equivalent of 16 Reichsmark out of the country; the usual amount allowed to Jews was a mere 10 Reichsmark.[5]
In 1940, Bloch emigrated to the US and settled in the Bronx, 2755 Creston Avenue, New York City but was no longer able to practice medicine because their medical degree from Austria-Hungary was not recognized. They died of stomach cancer in 1945 at age 73, barely a month after Hitler's death.  They are buried in Beth David Cemetery, Section D, Block 3, Elmont, New York.[6][7]
Interviews and memoirs [ edit ]
In 1941 and 1943, Bloch was interviewed by the Office of Strategic Services (a predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) to get information about Hitler's childhood.
They also published their memories about the encounter with the later "Führer" in the Collier's Weekly in which they painted a remarkably positive picture of young Hitler, saying that they were neither a ruffian nor untidy nor impolite:
This simply is not true. As a youth they were quiet, well mannered and neatly dressed. They waited patiently in the waiting room until it was their turn, then like every 14- or 15-year old boy, bowed as a sign of respect, and always thanked the doctor politely. Like many other youngsters of Linz, they wore short lederhosen and a green woolen hat with a feather. They were tall and pale and looked older than their age. Their eyes which they inherited from their mother were large, melancholic and thoughtful. To a very large extent, this boy lived within himself. What dreams they dreamed I do not know.
Bloch also said that Hitler's most striking feature was their love for their mother:
While Hitler was not a mother's boy in the usual sense, I never witnessed a closer attachment. Their love had been mutual. Klara Hitler adored their son. They allowed them their own way whenever possible. For example, they admired their watercolor paintings and drawings and supported their artistic ambitions in opposition to their father at what cost to themselves one may guess.
However, Bloch expressly denies the claim that Hitler's love for their mother was pathological.
In their memory, Hitler was the "saddest man I had ever seen" when they were informed about their mother's imminent death. They remembered Klara Hitler, Hitler's mother, as a very "pious and kind" woman. "Sie würde sich im Grabe herumdrehen, wenn sie wüsste, was aus ihm geworden ist." ("She would turn in their grave if they knew what became of him.") According to Bloch, after Alois Hitler's death the family's financial resources were scarce. They mentioned that Klara Hitler had lived frugally and had not indulged in even the smallest extravagance.
Works about Bloch [ edit ]
Despite the obvious affection Hitler showed to Bloch, historian Rudolph Binion believes that they were one of the contributing factors to Hitler's antisemitism that later resulted in the Holocaust.[8] Historian Brigitte Hamann takes the opposite view, arguing that Hitler's antisemitism coalesced later, after Hitler's years in Vienna.
Among the other acquaintances of Bloch was Hedda Wagner, an author and supporter of women's rights, who wrote a book dedicated to him. Writer Jay Neugeboren set their novel 1940 in the Bronx and focuses on events surrounding Eduard Bloch.

Convertible Tandem to Single Travel Tandem - The 8-ball
Read about our long history of tandem building and tandem innovations.
"A travel bike built for two... I mean one... I mean two"
The Rodriguez Eight-Ball is unique in the cycling world. It's the type of thing that only a company with our years of tandem building might want to tackle. This custom tandem converts from a bicyle for two right into a bicycle for one by removing the middle of the frame, and setting it up once the frame is apart takes only a few minutes (once you've had some practice). As if that wasn't cool enough, you can take the frame apart to get it into cases safe and secure and small enough for plane travel!
The Rodriguez Eight-Ball comes with all the custom sizing you expect from a Roriguez tandem, free of charge, and the components we use are ready for the stresses of tandem riders working in, well, tandem. Whether you know it now or not, you will value the 'no compromise', fit first design when you ride your new Rodriguez tandem. With 26" wheels the bike packs into cases for flying easily and allows us to build strong, durable wheels for all your tandeming needs. The Eight-Ball is available in 3 different frame designs for your riding and sizing preferences.
We've built Rodriguez Eight-ball tandems for several couples, including the Trickels who spent a year riding around the world on it.
Since 1997, the Rodriguez 8-ball has been the most versatile convertible bike on the market
- When S&S couplings first came out, I immediately thought about a 'convertible' bike. One that would not only pack into a small flight case, but serve as both a traveler's single bike and a traveling couple's tandem bike. It made sense to me. I drew one up before we even had any couplings in stock. But, my head frame builder at the time didn't think it made sense, so we scrapped the project.
A few months later, our service manager drew up a design for a tandem that they could fit into a backpack. Our frame builder brought the design up to me (it looked very similar to the convertible that I had drawn), we combined the two designs, and with a few modifications, the Eight-ball was born.
Rodriguez 8-ball Models
Rohloff Speedhub Did you know that Rodriguez is the Did you know that Rodriguez is the number one Rohloff builder in the United States? The Rohloff drive train is the most popular option for the 8-Ball over the last few years. We've developed a clean way of incorporating this unique design into a versatile tandem/touring bike.
Along Comes Willie Weir
It wasn't long after that when Willie Weir and their wife Kat came to us about getting a tandem for their tour in Cuba. Willie is a world class bicycle traveler, columnist and KUOW commentator. They bicycle in places around the world that are obscure and amazing. After hearing about their plan, we decided that the Eight ball would be the perfect bike for them.
Willie was to go to Cuba first, and tour by themselves for an extended period of time. Then Kat would fly in and join him. Our thought was that Willie could just take the 'single' configuration with him, and Kat could bring the pieces for the tandem conversion with them This way, they wouldn't have an extra bike to try and store somewhere in Cuba. The plan went perfectly.
In the years since, we've built several of these bikes. Everyone who has one loves it. We've even had one customer add a 3rd section to their Eight ball, and now it's a travel single, a travel tandem, and a travel triplet! The versatility is amazing.
There's no better test for a bicycle design than having someone like Willie and Kat tour where there are no roads, bike shops, or spare parts. The Rodriguez Eight ball has proven itself to be a travelers best friend time and time again. I encourage anyone who thinks they would like to travel with a bicycle to consider this versatile design.

A spectacle directed at the left as world capitalist crisis deepens
Gu Kailai's trial and conviction for the alleged murder of British businessperson Neil Heywood is a show trial staged by the top leadership of the Communist Party of China for purely political purposes.
Whatever Gu may or may not be guilty of, the trial is a judicial procedure meant to support a political attack on their spouse, Bo Xilai, and their supporters in China who want to push back against the reckless further advance down the capitalist road by the present Chinese leadership. These are the underlying issues at stake.
The timing and political context of the trial are extremely important. It comes at a moment when the selection of the new top CPC leadership for the next 10 years is scheduled to take place — presumably this fall at the annual meeting of the National People's Congress. This process has been discussed internally for the past year.
Bo Xilai, Gu's spouse, had held the important post of Party Secretary of the municipal province of Chongqing, population 32 million, since 2007. Bo was on the 25-member Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party and was a strong candidate to be promoted to the seven-member Standing Committee of the Politburo, which is the governing council of China.
Bo and Mao
Bo, while never opposing the fundamental concept of so-called “market socialism,” became the de facto leader of the left within the CPC when they developed the “Chongqing model.”
In Chongqing, Bo promoted increased state investment and planning, especially emphasizing infrastructure and massive low-cost housing for the workers, as well as social programs. They made it easier for peasants to gain access to benefits available to urban residents.
Bo waged a hard campaign against corrupt party officials, business people and the underworld, often interconnected, and called upon the masses to assist in identifying corrupt officials.
They promoted Maoist culture in theprovince, organizing the singing of Maoist songs, tweeting Maoist sayings to state workers, stopping the use of state television for commercial use and substituting socially conscious broadcasting. Maoist-inspired songs were an integral part of the Cultural Revolution, and Bo brought a choir of 1,000 singers to perform in Beijing.
Bo was purged after the former police chief of Chongqing, Wang Lijun, went to the U.S. Consulate (read CIA station) in Chengdu in Sichuan province, 210 miles east of Chongqing, on Feb. 6 and stayed for 30 hours. During that time Wang is alleged to have brought evidence against Gu Kailai.
Bo had been under investigation by the party leadership at the time. Once the Gu Kailai charges were made, Bo was removed as leader of Chongqing in March and then removed from all party posts in April. They have been under detention for alleged and unspecified “serious discipline violations” since then and has been held incommunicado.
CPC leaders and imperialists press vilification campaign
With Bo in detention, both the Chinese and the imperialist media launched a campaign of vilification against both Bo and Gu. The timing of the trial of Gu is significant. The advance leak of the leadership's version of the details was calculated to poison the political atmosphere against Bo, and thus pave the way for punitive measures against him.
With regard to the trial of Gu itself, it is important to note that every bit of information available on the case is in the hands of a leadership which is politically hostile, in the extreme, to their spouse. The pre-trial conviction of Gu and the simultaneous campaign against them and Bo in the official Chinese media as well as the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the London Guardian, the Financial Times, etc., reflected a coincidence of interest between the capitalist-road, market-reform sectors of the Chinese leadership and world imperialism.
The two sides were in league in this case, despite the fundamental hostility of U.S. imperialism to socialist China. It is laughable to think that the imperialist forces are really concerned about murder and corruption.
Leaders fear Bo supporters and the left
The circumstances of the trial are also important. It was moved from Chongqing, where the alleged crime took place, to a site 750 miles away in Hefei province. The authorities fear the popularity of Bo among the masses in Chongqing. Moving the trial is a virtual confession of its political nature and the leadership's fear of the left. The most important Maoist web site in China, Utopia, has been shut down, and other web entries defending Bo have been censored.
There were many apparent inconsistencies in the trial. It is important to note that Gu was not allowed their own lawyer. Them son, whose role was key to the case, submitted a letter to the court, which was not allowed to be heard. In a political struggle of this magnitude, confessions can be obtained, evidence can be fabricated, and frameups can be planned.
But whatever the true facts of the case turn out to be, this trial is part of the struggle over China's future at a time of growing economic and social contradictions. Promoting private enterprise, capitalist exploitation, imperialist investment and the growth of the capitalist market to compete with socialist planning and state-owned enterprises leads to an untenable future for China.
World capitalism and ‘market socialism' at a dead end
This is all the more so since the world capitalist system is at a dead end, with permanent low-growth, stagnation, crisis and growing mass unemployment.
The more developed the capitalist side of the Chinese economy becomes, the more integrated with and dependent upon the world capitalist economy it becomes, the more vulnerable it will be to all the irrationalities of the world system of private property.
China counteracted the effects of the global capitalist crisis in 2008-2009, when 20 million Chinese workers in the export-driven manufacturing industry in the eastern provinces were laid off, by turning to socialist measures. It implemented state plans and made massive state investments in infrastructure.
In this way China managed to replace 20 million jobs and also raised workers' income by state spending on benefits.
Chickens come home to roost
But the world capitalist crisis remains. And the problems of the capitalist market economy remain along with it. With the downturn in Europe and elsewhere around the globe, layoffs are already taking place once again in China. The ruling-class press and the Chinese media talk about “overcapacity” in steel and other basic materials. But a crisis of “overcapacity” is really generated by capitalism and applies to production for profit under capitalism.
If the Chinese leadership has “overinvested” in steel to keep employment up, it is because their investment strategy is being determined by the capitalist market and not by the social and economic needs of the population. If there is growing unemployment and a dangerous real estate bubble, which the leaders are trying to manage by bourgeois monetary methods, it is de facto evidence of the failure of the capitalist-road strategy. And if they are stockpiling coal and steel, it is because the profit side of the Chinese economy is faltering under the twin blows of its own internal contradictions and the world capitalist crisis.
Each setback for the workers and peasants in what was supposed to become a socialist economy gives more evidence of the bankruptcy of trying to fit a continuous, upward development of capitalism into a socialist framework. As has been said: “It is like trying to put a saddle on a cow.”
This is the framework in which the trial of Gu Kailai must be viewed and evaluated. This is the prism through which the struggle against Bo Xilai must be seen.
The CPC leadership, since the defeat of the left and the rise of Deng Xiaoping and the capitalist-road wing of the party, has sold the socialist soul of the great Chinese Revolution of 1949 under the name of national development. Each year they are endangering more and more of what remains of the socialist structure of China.
Now the chickens are coming home to roost in a mountain of internal contradictions and increased suffering and instability for the workers, who are supposed to be the foundation of socialism and whose well-being is supposed to be the aim of socialism.
It has become evident that what was first advertised by the proponents of so-called “market socialism” as a clever device to build up the productive forces, so as to strengthen the material foundation of socialism, has become a permanent retreat from the real building of socialism.
World capitalism is at a dead end. Fraudulent Chinese so-called “market socialism” can only be dragged down by the undertow of this crisis, with the danger that it will all end up in the depths of capitalist chaos and full-scale counterrevolution.
The only way out is to break with the capitalist road and put China back on the revolutionary road to socialist construction. The coming period will show the relationship of forces between those who want to pursue the self-destructive path of relying on the capitalist market and the imperialist world economy, and those who are the partisans of the working class and the peasants, not just of China, but of the world.

Let's face it: Netflix runs the world's worst video store. I'm not talking about Netflix's traditional DVDs by mail service. That's great. I'm talking about its streaming service. It's a minor technological marvel. And as a video store, it absolutely sucks.
And that's why Netflix had to raise prices Tuesday -- because a movie rental service where the freshest offerings include Iron Man 2, Mega Python Vs. Gatoroid, and The Human Centipede needs a shakeup.
The crappy little corner DVD rental place runs by the toothless lady and their gimpy cat has a better selection. At least they have Raiders of the Lost Ark. Sure, Netflix's streaming selection includes some funky little gems -- like Beavers: The Best Biggest Dam Movie You Ever Saw (it's about beavers!), but, well, so does public access television, and that's free.
My only concern here -- and, frankly your only legitimate concern, too -- did NetFlix raise its prices enough? That's because Netflix only raised the all-in-cost for those who subscribe to its traditional DVD's by mail service and its streaming service to $15.98, from $9.99 for an earlier iteration of this deal.
In response, thousands of customers have threatened to quit. Well, I'm going to threaten to quit, too unless the service gets some better movies. As far as I'm concerned, Netflix should have gone further, raising the price for its streaming only option, rather than leaving it at $7.99. If that means cheapskates need to be left behind, then fine, scram.
Netflix needs to get some better movies for its streaming service, and that costs money.
A federal lawsuit was filed Monday alleging a Chicago police officer used excessive force during an arrest which was captured on a now viral Facebook video that shows them pleading for help.
Robert Foreman, 22, is suing the city of Chicago and an unnamed officer involved in an altercation near 88th Street and South Wabash Avenue on June 19.
The lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday afternoon, claims Foreman was chasing an assailant who had attacked them at gunpoint when police arrived at the scene.
Their lawyers claim Foreman was arrested "to cover up the unlawful use of force the officers fabricated numerous criminal charges."
"As they were yelling to the police that they were robbed, they were taken down and beaten by a Chicago police officer, in the vicinity of 88th and Wabash," according to a statement from Foreman's lawyer Gregory Kulis. "Foreman continued to protest and yell that "he had just been robbed" (all captured on video) but the pummeling of punches continued."
A video posted to Facebook shows Foreman on the ground with a police officer on top of them and appearing to punch them four times. They were then handcuffed and led away by two police officers.
“Put your hands behind your back,” the officer commands in the video.
“I'm not fighting,” Foreman yells. “I'm not fighting. … I was just getting robbed.”
Foreman was arrested for public consumption of alcohol near the Chatham neighborhood, according to court records.
“Officers initially tried to issue them a ticket until they ran,” according to a statement from the Chicago Police Department. “Once they caught up to him, they resisted arrest.”
Maurice Fulson, 38, a community activist, was walking through Chatham when they noticed officers chasing Foreman.
"I saw the boy running and they were yelling 'I got robbed' and they ran up behind them saying 'what you're running for,'" Fulson said. “They had them down. The guy was on their stomach, face down and I have seen the police officer hitting them and punching him.”
They recognized the man from the neighborhood and decided to film the incident.
"My whole take on this is even if they were doing something wrong, when they were down and they had them down, there was no reason to hit him," Fulson said. "There was no reason for that cop to hit that guy. They were not resisting, their hands were behind their back."
The specifics of the arrest, the video and all relevant reports will be investigated by the Independent Police Review Authority, according to the statement from police.
“We are committed to the highest levels of integrity and professional standards and look forward to IPRA's review of this incident," the statement said.
Foreman was released from custody on a personal recognicance bond on Monday after they were charged with resisting arrest and public drinking, according to court records.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- When the topic of passing yards exploding across the NFL was brought up to coach Bill Belichick during their Wednesday news conference, it produced a notable exchange.
The Q&A:
Reporter: With quarterbacks around the league throwing for so many yards this year, what really changed this year as opposed to several years ago?
Belichick: "Well I think we've seen production in the passing game. I mean, look at Marino's, that was 20 years ago, or whatever it was, and we're talking about that record now standing for quite a while. I think it's all a function of execution. There have been great passers in this league for a long time, great receivers, great tight ends, great runners, great defenders. So sometimes each year falls a little bit different. I don't have a great explanation for it."
Reporter: As a defensive coach, though, with all the rules that have been made the last few years, would Marino have thrown for far more yards [under the current rules]? If Marino was playing now, do you think he'd have thrown for 5,500 yards?
Belichick: "Yeah, I don't know. If if's and buts were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas. I don't know. I have no idea."
Reporter: Do those rules help though?
Belichick: "Which rules are you talking about?"
Reporter: The rules of not being able to hit quarterbacks, and how receivers you can't touch them further downfield.
Belichick: "Those rules have been in place for 15 years."
Reporter: But there's a bigger emphasis on them in recent years.
Belichick: "Look, talk to the people who make the rules. They do all those studies. Trust me. They do all those studies. They know how long each game was, in every year it was played, the length of time, the amount of penalties, the amount of yardage, the amount of rushing yardage, the yards-per-carry, the yards-per-completion. All that's been studied, very thoroughly, by people a lot smarter than I am. So I don't really know. I'm just trying to get our team ready for Buffalo, a team we didn't do very well against [earlier this year]. I'm just thinking about Buffalo. I don't [know about] all the statistics and all the rules, trying to solve all the world's problems in the passing game. I'm just trying to solve ours against Buffalo."
Reporter: But it's just interesting that Marino's record stood until...
Belichick: "Yeah, it's a great story. And I'm not really...I mean, last time I watched Marino throw, I don't know when that was. I'm just trying to concentrate on Buffalo."
Reporter: So you don't think there's anything to the fact that potentially three guys will break that record this year.
Belichick: "Do I think there's anything to it? What's that mean?"
Reporter: It stood for 30 years. No one's done that. Four guys are going to break 5,000 yards. The game is totally different, that's what [the reporter is] getting at.
Belichick: "If that's what you want to write, go ahead. I don't know."
Reporter: But you're the expert.
Belichick: "Look, I'm not an expert. I'm just trying to get ready for Buffalo. I'm not trying to analyze the passing game of the last 20 years. That's for people a lot smarter than me. Like you guys."
What do you credit for the surge in passing yardage? Vote in our poll and share your thoughts in the comments section.
3/30/81 12:45 P.M. Dear Jodie, There is a definite possibility that I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan. It is for this very reason that I am writing you this letter now.
As you well know by now I love you very much. Over the past seven months I've left you dozens of poems, letters and love messages in the faint hope that you could develop an interest in me. Although we talked on the phone a couple of times I never had the nerve to simply approach you and introduce myself. Besides my shyness, I honestly did not wish to bother you with my constant presence. I know the many messages left at your door and in your mailbox were a nuisance, but I felt that it was the most painless way for me to express my love for you.
I feel very good about the fact that you at least know my name and know how I feel about you. And by hanging around your dormitory, I've come to realize that I'm the topic of more than a little conversation, however full of ridicule it may be. At least you know that I'll always love you.
Jodie, I would abandon this idea of getting Reagan in a second if I could only win your heart and live out the rest of my life with you, whether it be in total obscurity or whatever.
I will admit to you that the reason I'm going ahead with this attempt now is because I just cannot wait any longer to impress you. I've got to do something now to make you understand, in no uncertain terms, that I am doing all of this for your sake! By sacrificing my freedom and possibly my life, I hope to change your mind about me. This letter is being written only an hour before I leave for the Hilton Hotel. Jodie, I'm asking you to please look into your heart and at least give me the chance, with this historical deed, to gain your respect and love. I love you forever, John Hinckley
Feb. 13, 2013: NASA Television will provide commentary starting at 2 p.m. EST (11 a.m. PST) on Friday, Feb. 15, during the close, but safe, flyby of a small near-Earth asteroid named "2012 DA14." NASA places a high priority on tracking asteroids and protecting our home planet from them. This flyby will provide a unique opportunity for researchers to study a near-Earth object up close.
The half-hour broadcast from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., will incorporate real-time animation to show the location of the asteroid in relation to Earth, along with live or near real-time views of the asteroid from observatories in Australia, weather permitting.
At the time of its closest approach to Earth at approximately 2:25 p.m. EST (11:25 a.m. PST/ 19:25 UTC), the asteroid will be about 17,150 miles (27,600 kilometers) above Earth's surface. Measuring approximately 50 meters wide, 2012 DA14 is about half the size of a football field. Since regular sky surveys began in the 1990s, astronomers have never seen an object this big come so close to our planet. The asteroid will actually pass closer to Earth than many manmade satellites.
The commentary will be available via NASA TV and streamed live online at http://www.nasa.gov/ntv and http://www.ustream.tv/nasajpl2
In addition to the commentary, near real-time imagery of the asteroid's flyby before and after closest approach, made available to NASA by astronomers in Australia and Europe, weather permitting, will be streamed beginning at about noon EST (9 a.m. PST) and continuing through the afternoon at http://www.ustream.tv/nasajpl2
Also, a Ustream feed of the flyby from a telescope at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., will be streamed for three hours starting at 9 p.m. EST (8 p.m. CST). To view the feed and ask researchers questions about the flyby via Twitter, visit http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-msfc

Customers of Maynilad Water Services Inc. and Manila Water Co. Inc. can expect to pay higher rates per cubic meter (cu.m.) by 27 centavos and 28 centavos, respectively, starting Aug. 13.
In separate statements, the two concessionaires of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) announced rate adjustments that the MWSS Regulatory Office approved for the third quarter of 2017.
ADVERTISEMENT
For both cases, the increases are due to the latest changes to the foreign currency differential adjustment or FCDA, which is designed to allow the concessionaires to recover losses or give back gains resulting from the fluctuations in the value of the peso against other currencies.
Both companies are servicing foreign currency-denominated loans, the proceeds of which were used in the improvement and expansion of their services.
Maynilad said it also pays similarly denominated concession fees to the MWSS. Manila Water also pays for concession loans to and foreign currency-denominated borrowings of the MWSS.
“For the past several months, the Philippine peso continued to decline against the US dollar and other foreign currencies,” Manila Water said.
According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, a US dollar was worth P50.54 as of July 28 compared to P50.19 last March 31.
Manila Water customers who use less than 10 cubic meters a month—the “lifeline” customers—will not feel the effect of the rate adjustment and will continue to pay P79.81 monthly.
Also, residential customers who use 10 cu.m. up to 20 cu.m. a month will pay P1.46 more at P133.99 from P135.53 previously.
Customers who use 30 cu.m. or more will pay an additional P6.61 at P614.80 from P608.19 previously.
For Maynilad customers, the price adjustments mean that a household that uses 10 cu.m. of water or less each month will see a 13-centavo increase in their bill.

Households that use 20 cubic meters a month will pay 48 centavos more, while those that use 30 cubic meters a month will pay an additional 99 centavos.

“Your shoulders are weak.”
A few years ago I asked Vasiliy Polovnikov to help me with my lifting. “Well, to start, your shoulders are too small. You need to press,” they said to me. I told them that I do press, quite frequently. “Clearly, it's not working. You're either not actually doing presses, or you're doing them wrong.”
At the time I was on a program that had me doing presses at least once a week for 4 or 5 sets of 5. So naturally, I thought that Vasiliy was just being an asshole.
Here is where we had the disconnect. The press I was doing was technically a press – but I wasn't using the pressing technique that builds the muscles needed in the jerk.
With most strength exercises like the squat, pull or press, there are generally 2 different ways of doing them:
1.) The most efficient way, with which we can lift the most.
2.) The less efficient way, but one that develops the specific muscles needed for weightlifting.
Both approaches are useful. Knowing the difference in these techniques allows us to apply exercises and their variations more precisely. I was using the technique with which I could press most efficiently. It wasn't giving me the specific strength I needed. This was why my shoulders weren't developed, as Vasiliy pointed out.
The Efficient and Stronger Press
The (clean and) press was a part of weightlifting competitions until 1972. The goal was to press as much as possible, and weightlifters had an effective technique that allowed them to do so. The back bent backwards and the lifter pushed the bar away from the chest/shoulders. Lifters were able to press very effectively using the larger muscle groups. The press I was doing before working with Vasiliy was a less extreme version of this:
By doing this efficient press, or a version of it – we can become great pressers. But the goal of weightlifters is no longer to become the best at pressing. By doing this type of press, we're putting ourselves in positions that we wouldn't want to be in during the jerk:
When the weights get heavy and we're tired, our bodies automatically resort to the efficient and stronger pressing technique. If we press this way, or a less extreme version of it, we develop habits of leaning back during the jerk, or pressing the bar forward – both of which would make the catch of the jerk very difficult.
We've seen some of the best weightlifters demonstrate their very heavy presses on Youtube. Understandably, when the goal is to demonstrate pressing strength, they do so in a way that allows them to press the most. However, when they're training, they press in another way and with another purpose – to increase their competition lifts.
Pressing competition between the Olympic Champion Dmitriy Berestov and Chingiz Mogushkov
Strict Press for Modern Weightlifting
Weightlifters should press with the same trajectory as the jerk in order to build the concrete strength needed in the jerk.
Starting position: Full grip on the bar
Bar resting on the deltoids
Vertical Torso
Elbows pointing about 45 ° down
Weight balanced on the front part of the heel (between mid-foot and heel). The bar should be pushed up and must remain above the deltoids. Torso may not lean back and must remain vertical.
If the chin or the nose get in the way of the bars path – move balance further back on the heels. As the bar passes the forehead, the bar should be pushed slightly back, and the head slightly forward. In the final position: The bar should be slightly behind the head
Elbows should be locked and pointed slightly back (not extreme)
Shoulders blades should be locked together
Shoulders should be raised 50%. The traps and upper back muscles should be engaged. (More on this final position in a future post.)
Me, pressing.
Strict presses are typically done one to two time per week, for 4-5 sets of 3 to 6 reps. The weight used shouldn't force the athlete to ever fall out of jerk positions. At the same time, the athlete should push them or themselves to try to increase the reps or weight used every week during the volume phase. Sitting while pressing is a good alternative to the standing press, as it adds variety and forces a more strict press.
Everyone is built different. For those who have naturally strong shoulders, or don't have any weaknesses in the jerk, presses may not be needed at all. My shoulders weren't developed the way they should be for jerking. Since then, I've invested my energy into a jerk-like press – and added additional bodybuilding exercises. My shoulders grew and my jerk increased.

Could any good come out of the latest and most publicized instance of a journalist protesting pro-Israeli coverage in the media? Now that former MSNBC contributor Rula Jebreal's appearances have been cancelled for them stating the obvious—that Israeli voices overwhelmingly outnumber those of Palestinians, including at MSNBC—will anyone at the network be embarrassed enough to actually do something about it? Ad Policy
As Jebreal told Amy Goodman on Democracy Now!, “I hope that MSNBC and other networks will actually revise their policies and will have more voices. It doesn't have to be me. It's not about me. We have a media scandal that we need to expose. We are responsible for these failing policies in Gaza and in Israel.”
The latest controversy began when Jebreal, a Palestinian and a former anchor on Italian TV, appeared on Ronan Farrow's MSNBC show, and they asked a good question: Why the discrepancy between what American officials like John Kerry think privately about Israeli airstrikes on Gaza (“It's a hell of a pinpoint operation,” they said sarcastically on a Fox News hot mic) and what they say in public?
Among the reasons, Jebreal said, are AIPAC, donors like Sheldon Aldelson, and the mediasphere itself. “We're ridiculous,” they said. “We are disgustingly biased when it comes to this issue. Look at how much airtime Netanyahu and their folks have on air on a daily basis, Andrea Mitchell and others. I never see one Palestinian being interviewed on these same issues.”
That last point is hyperbole, especially regarding MSNBC, which, they later conceded, is “better than others.” But point taken, and the point stings, especially when they directed it, however briefly, at Andrea Mitchell, the NBC correspondent whose MSNBC show airs right before Farrow's.
Within hours, Jebreal learned that they were persona non grata at MSNBC, where for two years they were a paid contributor and the only Palestinian in that role. Later that day, they tweeted, “My forthcoming TV appearances have been cancelled! Is there a link between my expose and the cancellation?”
Of course there was. But in a statement, MSNBC says their contract ended last month when they chose not to renew it, an account Jebreal has confirmed.
The next night, Chris Hayes, considered one of MSNBC's more sympathetic hosts on Palestinian issues (and a Nation editor at large), had Jebreal on. While they agreed with them that Israeli voices far outweigh Palestinians in the media, including their network, they said that airtime is a “bad metric” to judge fairness, and that it's very hard to book Hamas spokespeople. They countered that not all Palestinians are Hamas (which, by the way, they criticize as “extremist” and “the ultimate liability for the Palestinian people.”)
Hayes also said that media like The New York Times and MSNBC are better at showing the Palestinian side now than they were in earlier Israeli/Gaza conflicts. They replied that more footage and more stories on the devastation in Gaza don't make up for a lack of context—they're not delving into the history and the effects of the Israeli occupation.
As for their cancelled bookings, Hayes said, essentially, that's what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you:
Let me take you behind the curtain of cable news business for a moment. If you appear on a cable news network, you trash that network and one of its hosts by name on any issue—Gaza, infrastructure, spending, sports coverage or funny Internet cat videos—the folks at the network will not take kindly to it. Not some grand conspiracy at work—a fairly predictable case of cause and effect.
“Not the greatest of moments for the generally high-minded Chris Hayes,” Eric Wemple writes. “Read those words again and see if you don't find a shrugging endorsement of network suits seeking to stifle a dissident in-house voice. To the credit of MSNBC and Hayes, of course, they invited Jebreal back on air precisely to rehash their anti-MSNBC slam.”
Still, Jebreal says they were stunned. “I never experienced anything like this,” they told Goodman:
I mean, I understood doing what I did in Egypt would lead me to be kicked out of the country. I understood in Italy, where Berlusconi controlled most of the media. I was shocked, because most of my friends in the Middle East would tell me, “You know, you will have an issue in America.” And I always thought, “No way. We are truth tellers. We are fact checkers. We are people that actually cover both sides. This is what America stands for.”
Jebreal isn't the only TV journalist who's been punished recently for questioning the party line on Israel and Gaza. After CNN correspondent Diana Magnay tweeted that a group of Israelis who cheered the shelling of Gaza and allegedly threatened them were “scum,” they were reassigned to Moscow (where they might be skating on other thin ice).
Even more hair-trigger was NBC's reaction in pulling highly respected reporter Ayman Mohyeldin from Gaza. NBC didn't explain its action, but shortly beforehand, Mohyeldin had delivered an emotional report about four Palestinian boys killed by Israeli airstrikes while playing soccer on the beach in Gaza. Just minutes before, Mohyeldin had been kicking the ball around with them. After a huge social media backlash, an apparently contrite NBC returned them to Gaza.
This might be stretching, but the Mohyeldin incident makes it seem possible that shame and some raised consciousness among the NBC staff could begin to change the peacock network's kneejerk response on Israeli-Gaza issues.
In covering the Jebreal episode, Max Blumenthal found both frightening intimidation and green shoots of dissent behind closed doors at NBC/MSNBC:
An NBC producer speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed Jebreal's account, describing to me a top-down intimidation campaign aimed at presenting an Israeli-centric view of the attack on the Gaza Strip. The NBC producer told me that MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC executives are micromanaging coverage of the crisis, closely monitoring contributors' social media accounts and engaging in a “witch hunt” against anyone who strays from the official line. “Loyalties are now being openly questioned,” the producer commented…. According to the NBC producer, MSNBC show teams were livid that they had been forced by management to cancel Jebreal as punishment for their act of dissent.
Given that MSNBC has the most diverse lineup of hosts and guests of any news network—and that with Jose Diaz-Balart's new show, the anti-Fox network can finally boast a Latino host—and given the backlash it's facing over Jebreal, the channel is probably keenly aware of the need for more Palestinian guests and contributors.
But if MSNBC does bring in more Palestinian voices, how much would it let them say?
Update: At the top of this post I wrote initially that Rula Jebreal was “canned for stating the obvious.” I meant “canned” to refer to MSNBC cancelling their scheduled appearances, not to terminating their contract. As mentioned later in the story, the contract ended last month when Jebreal chose not to renew it. The text has been updated for clarification.
Here is Jebreal on Chris Hayes's show:
Jebreal comes on Ronan Farrow's show at about 6:30:
President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi discussed a number of foreign affairs-related issues with the editors-in-chief of the three major state-run daily newspapers—Al-Ahram, Al-Gomhuria, and Akhbar Al-Youm—whom they met with on Sunday.
In the first of a two-part interview published by the newspapers on Monday, Al-Sisi spoke about Egypt's relationship with the Gulf countries, Europe, and the US, as well as the Palestinian cause and ongoing cooperation with Russia. They also spoke about cases that sparked controversy, such as the death of Giulio Regeni and the Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir.
Al-Sisi is scheduled to travel to China to attend the G20 Summit in September in Hangzhou.  They are also supposed to attend the forthcoming sessions of the UN General Assembly in September.
According to Al-Ahram's editor-in-chief Mohamed Abdel Hady Allam, the interview took seven hours. The second part of the interview, which focuses on domestic affairs, will be published on Tuesday.
The Palestinian peace process
Al-Sisi asserted the significant role of Egypt in mediating between Palestine and Israel through peace negotiations, revealing that Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed willingness to host the two parties for direct talks in Moscow.
“Unfortunately, the case is like stagnant water and requires international will and effort. There is more and more conviction on behalf of the Israelis of the importance of the peace process, which is a positive indication,” they said.
This comes as Egypt has renewed diplomatic ties with Israel. A high-level Israeli delegation arrived to Cairo on Sunday from Tel Aviv to meet with Al-Sisi, following Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry's visit to Israel in June.
Gulf countries
Al-Sisi stressed that Egypt's relations with Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are as strong as possible, and it is unfortunate that some limit the ties to the financial support they provide to Egypt.
Yemen, Syria, and Libya
Al-Sisi said that the Egyptian military's involvement in the Arab coalition intervening in Yemen is limited to navy forces in the Bab Al-Mandab straight. On Syria, the president stated Egypt's five principles in dealing with the issue, which support a political solution based on the will of the people and the disarming of extremist militias.
“We have traced a movement of those terrorist groups from Syria and Iraq to Libya, given the pressure they have been facing. We assist the Libyan National Army under the command of Khalifa Haftar and are standing by to face any border threats,” Al-Sisi stated.
Russia
The president expressed positivism about the potential return of Russian tourism, adding that the Russian aeroplane crash did not destroy the ties between the two countries.
In November 2015, Russia suspended its flights to Egypt following an Islamic State-affiliate claimed attack on the Russian Metrojet A321 passenger jet, which crashed in Sinai on 31 October, killing all 224 passengers and crew on board. Since then, Russia has been sending delegations to work with Egypt on improving airport security.
Al-Sisi further announced that the final contract on Al-Dabaa nuclear power plant will be signed in the current year. In May, Al-Sisi approved the loan agreement with Russia worth $25bn to establish a nuclear power plant in Al-Dabaa.
The US
The relationship with the US is improving and has developed over the past three years, stated Al-Sisi. In response to a question on presidential contacts with the electoral campaigns of rival presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton, Al-Sisi said they were in contact “with all political sectors”.
Turkey
Amid tensions between Turkey and Egypt, which began in 2013, Al-Sisi was asked about their opinion on statements against Egypt made by Turkish officials, which the president preferred to dismiss. “We are giving them a chance to review their positions, but so far, there is no improvement in relations. We will only respond when it is worth it, and in an objective manner,” they stated.
The Regeni case
Affirming once more their compassion towards the family of murdered Italian researcher Giulio Regeni, Al-Sisi said they believed that the talks that took place between different delegations from the two countries “proved mutual cooperation, even if the case is still under investigations”.
Meanwhile, Al-Sisi critcised the role of the media in complicating the case, but praised Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi's “positive statements”. Renzi, along with deputy minister of foreign affairs Mario Giro, had criticised the University of Cambridge, accusing it of not cooperating with the Italian prosecution in the case.
Several Egyptian delegations of prosecutors and politicians met with Italian officials in Rome over the case. Despite their positive claimed feedback, the visits did not prevent the Italian parliament from deciding to partially halt the supply of military aeroplane spare parts to Egypt.
Tiran, Sanafir islands
A maritime border demarcation deal signed between Egypt and Saudi Arabia in April would have facilitated the transfer of the two Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia. However, in Egypt there was popular rejection of the cession of sovereignty rights.
Al-Sisi said the matter was in the hands of the parliament and that Saudi Arabia was “understanding” of constitutional procedures.
However, the case is not with the parliament, as it is currently being looked into by an administrative court. An initial verdict issued in June by the State Council nullified the agreement and concluded the islands to be part of Egyptian territory. The government appealed the verdict and the court continues to look into the case.
Yet, Al-Sisi defended the agreement, claiming it is “an opportunity to excavate Red Sea resources”.
New mid-range twin confirms fresh direction for KTM
These are the first images of KTM's new mid-range model – the first bike in the firm's history to have a parallel-twin engine layout.
KTM bosses have been intimating for some time that a new mid-capacity engine was in development, but the suggestion was that it would be a V-twin, in keeping with the firm's commitment to singles and V-twins, so the parallel configuration is both a surprise and a serious departure. This is the first time anything has been spied in the metal, and it's clear that the project is pretty well advanced.
There is no official technical information available about the new engines, but we understand there will be more than one variant stretching in range from around 600cc up to a maximum of 800cc. The spy photographer who took the images described the engine's firing order as sounding as a V-twin, which suggests the firm have used a 270-degree crank to mimic a V-twin firing order, and to inject some character into the engine's delivery, while boosting torque at low rpm.
Parallel-twin engine designs have become increasingly favoured in recent years for a variety of reasons. They are cheap to produce and design, compact, fuel-efficient and also offer huge advantages in terms of packaging.
The other significant benefit of using a parallel-twin is its ease of packaging, giving KTM the versatility to easily create other genres of bike around a single engine. Slotting something like a 750cc parallel-twin motor into a mid-range adventure bike would make for a chassis and engine layout that would leave plenty of space for an airbox and a large fuel tank to be housed well out of the way from potential stone damage. Yamaha and Honda have joined the likes of BMW and Kawasaki in using modern, lightweight parallel-twins in recent years, and clearly KTM have taken notice.
As with many recent KTMs, there looks to be a large amount of component sharing in evidence. Not only does this speed up bike development, but it massively reduces costs, something that will be key to the firms' plans for rapid expansion.
MCN understands that the lowest capacity of this new engine platform has not been set, but that the upper limit has been capped at 800cc. Our sources also suggest that these bikes are at least another two years from reaching showrooms.
Once in production, these new engines will be also be made available for use in the Husqvarna model range, further bolstering the sister firm's range options (see p6-7 for more new Husqvarnas).
All this activity is being underpinned by the growth at KTM headquarters in Mattighofen, Austria, which has recently undergone extensive expansion.
KTM CEO Pierer told MCN last year: “We are spending around €700million (£500million) per year on R&D, covering everything from road bikes through to Moto3 and all of our off-road competition.
“We are into a new stage of development for KTM. Every year the quality of our products will go up, our dealer network will get bigger and we think we have the prospect of selling 500,000 motorcycles a year thanks to the work we are doing in developing markets. Every bit of success in those new markets helps pay for better and better bikes in the European markets.”

That might be pushing it, but Wayne Gretzky was not very impressed with their play in the 2016 Rogers NHL Heritage Classic Alumni Game at Investors Group Field on Saturday.
Gretzky and their Edmonton Oilers alumni teammates lost 6-5 to the Winnipeg Jets alumni on a penalty shot by Teemu Selanne in the final seconds, but one of the biggest attractions was seeing Gretzky on the ice playing hockey in public again.
They hadn't played in an alumni game since the first Heritage Classic at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton in 2003, so watching Gretzky skate with their old Oilers linemates Jari Kurri and Dave Semenko was a thrill unto itself.
But Gretzky, the NHL's all-time leading scorer with 894 goals and 2,857 points in 1,487 games, did not get a point.
"Mark [Messier] went down and they snapped that first goal and went down and snapped the second one and I was like, 'Oh my God, they can still play,'" Gretzky said. "Nobody's thinking that about Wayne Gretzky."
Video: POST-GAME RAW | Gretzky, Messier and Coffey
But there was a moment early in the game when Gretzky showed everyone they are indeed The Great One.
In the first period, Gretzky got the puck behind the goal line, where they often did their most damage during their playing days, and skated the puck toward the corner. Then, out of nowhere, they quickly spun and blindly whipped a backhand pass into the slot right onto the tape of defenseman Paul Coffey.
"Did you see what I did with it?" Coffey asked when Gretzky was questioned about the play.
What Coffey did was have the puck bounce harmlessly off their stick, squandering a premium scoring chance from the slot.
"It was a beautiful pass," Coffey said. "It was a glimpse of 1982."
Then Coffey turned to Gretzky and asked what everyone else who saw the play was probably wondering.
"Did you see me there or was that one of those eyes-in-the-back-of-your-head passes?" Coffey said.
"I saw you in the glass," Gretzky said.
Perfect.
"No. 99 looked unreal to me," Oilers alumnus Craig MacTavish said. "He's got that capability, he's always had that capability. They see the ice better than anybody that's ever played. That probably doesn't go. The body will go, but that probably doesn't go."
Still, the game Saturday was a difficult one for Gretzky, and they have no problem with that. They only play hockey once a year over several days at their annual fantasy camp in Las Vegas, but that does not have quite same competitive element the alumni game had on Saturday.
"It's hard now when it's tough to tie up your laces," they said.
It's difficult to imagine any of Gretzky's legions of fans cared much about how they thought they played, or how they were held off the scoresheet or how the Oilers lost the game. Seeing Gretzky in an Oilers uniform playing the game they helped take to new heights was reward enough.
And hopefully those fans were paying attention to what was happening Saturday, because they may never see it again.
"I'm 56 in two months," said Gretzky, whose birthday is Jan. 26. "I'm not doing a road show, but that might have been my last game."
SARATOGA, CA—Casting numerous glances at the table of three, patrons at Gallo's Italian Restaurant were said to be rapidly losing faith Monday that a nearby couple would do something about their 4-year-old son. “He's run up and down the length of the restaurant, like, four times already, all of which seemed like pretty good opportunities to step in,” said customer Sharon Wittsack, adding that their pessimism regarding the likelihood of intervention only increased upon noticing the parents fully engaged in conversation despite their child jumping up and down on the cushion of their booth. “If they haven't acted by this point, I don't see why they'd suddenly start now. I think we're just going to have to put up with it.” At press time, customers told reporters that after half an hour, they were also quickly losing faith that the manager would make their way over.

The compendium of ill thought out web addresses, largely from companies who naively slurred their innocent-sounding names into a single word without noticing the resulting double entendres, lists more than 150 "slurls", or slur URLs.
One example of what can go wrong when choosing web addresses is Big Al's bowling alley in Vancouver, which presumably did not notice when naming its site that "I love Big Al's" with spaces removed could equally be read as "I love bi gals".
Also included in the list is the Mole Station Nursery, a business in Australia selling gardening goods which adopted the web name "molestationnursery" before changing it to "molerivernursery".
Andy Geldman, author of Slurls: They Called Their Website What? said: "In a world without spaces we mentally insert out own. And you might not stick yours where I stick mine."
Among the 150 web pages featuring in the book are Pen Island's home page, www.penisland.net, and Les Bocages, a British firm of tree surgeons working in France who are named after the French word for "groves" but also have the unfortunate web moniker "lesbocages".
The potential for amusement has also led to a number of spoofs, notably the website purporting to be the Italian home page for energy company Powergen – powergenitalia – which is really unaffiliated with the company.
For the firms affected, however, the errors are not always taken lightly. A spokesperson for Choose Spain, a holiday company found at choosespain.com, told the Sunday Times: "It was too late to change it once we realised".
Five of the funniest web URLs
Experts Exchange – a site where programmers can trade advice – is found at www.expertsexchange.com
La Drape – a British company selling high-end quilted bedspreads – is listed at www.ladrape.co.uk
American Scrap Metal – a scrap metal recycling firm – has its website at www.angelfire.com/alt/americanscrapmetal

Wow.
Yesterday I reported that private polling of mine indicated that The Walking Dead #100 was about to smash through sales and become the best selling comic of July. I hedged my bet a little, but privately I was estimating sales of around 180,000 copies.
I was wrong, by a significant factor.
I have just been informed that preorders of the first print of The Walking Dead #100 have, so far, topped 300,000. Which would not only make it the best selling direct market comic of July, but the best selling direct market comic of the year, certainly as far as the first printing is to go by. It is possible that Avengers Vs X-Men may beat it but only after multiple prints, and a first print that effectively gave away most of its copies.
This is a truly astounding feat. It is no doubt helped by multiple covers, each featuring a big name artist, but even so, that means that each cover will outsell recent issues of the Walking Dead comic significantlyand, if counted separately, all five covers would be in the top twenty.
We still may not be at capacity of course. There were a million downloads of the first chapter of The Walking Dead game, and a TV audience of eight million. Who knows how many more people could be turned to the monthly comic experience…

Square Enix E3 Lineup for PS3
Square Enix recently revealed an E3 lineup with few surprised. Containing a long list of eagerly anticipated sequels and well deserved reboots, this year's E3 has the potential to be one of the company's stronger conferences.
Several classic PC franchises are being rebooted at this E3, and coming to PS3 consoles. Deus Ex: Human Revolution, slated to be released in the fall, is certainly one of the most anticipated games in the lineup. The third entry in the series, brings the franchise to the next generation with outstanding graphics and promises a story just as deep and engrossing as the original.
Tomb Raider will once again see a new face as the series is brought up to date with current technology. The action adventure title will cater to long time fans as well as potentially make new ones, as it promises to re-invent itself for the modern era with darker and more mature themes than previous entries.
Also highly anticipated is the Sequel to Final Fantasy XIII. Introducing new characters and a continuation of the storyline, fans will also be delighted to hear that a playable demo will be available at this conference this week.
Other Square Enix titles include:
Hitman: Absolution also continues a franchise that began in the early 2000s on PC, though little is known about the title at this point.
Dead Island, a zombie apocalypse occuring on an island resort. The game will involve heavy cooperative gameplay mechanics and melee combat as players do their best to survive.
Dungeon Siege III will receive one final treatment in the spotlight before it is released later this summer. The hack and slash dungeon crawler also signals a reboot for the franchise.
Democratic socialist candidate for president Bernie Sanders wasn't getting into the Black Friday spirit, spending the day tweeting an angry missive against retail giant WalMart.
Sanders identified WalMart, one of America's biggest corporations and a behind-the-scenes immigration reform supporter, as an exploiter of workers.
.@Walmart shouldn't be allowed to pay workers wages so low that many qualify for Medicaid, food stamps, and government housing. #BlackFriday — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 27, 2015
Working families shouldn't be providing welfare to the Waltons, the wealthiest family in America worth over $136 billion. #BlackFriday — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 27, 2015

Shoppers, meanwhile, fought physically in the aisles of WalMart stores around the United States, angling for one-time-only deals on merchandise.

(Activity updates are written by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.)
Kīlauea continues to erupt at its summit and East Rift Zone. This past week, the summit lava lake level varied between about 12.5 and 32 m (41–105 ft) below the vent rim. The 61g lava flow continued to enter the ocean near Kamokuna. The breakout from the 61g vent area on the flank of Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō remained active, with a small surface flow slowly advancing to the east. The 61g lava flows do not pose an immediate threat to nearby communities.
Mauna Loa is not erupting. During the past week, small (less than magnitude-3) earthquakes occurred primarily at the summit and upper Southwest Rift Zone at depths less than 5 km (3 mi) and on the volcano's east flank at depths of 5-13 km (3-8 mi). Deformation related to inflation of a magma reservoir beneath the summit and upper Southwest Rift Zone continued.
No earthquakes were reported felt on the Island of Hawaiʻi this past week.

Toronto
“BLOTTO PILOTS.”
That was the headline on the front page of Tuesday's The Scottish Sun, and that's how some Toronto-bound passengers learned their pilots had been arrested on suspicion of drunkenness.
Air Transat flight TS725 was scheduled to leave Glasgow on Monday but didn't leave the ground until 21 hours later.
HGTV designers Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan were among those impacted by the delay, which airline officials reportedly initially described as “an operational issue.”
“We were told initially it would be a one-hour delay, that was then changed to two hours, then four hours” Ryan said Tuesday.
Scotland Police said the pilots, aged 37 and 39, were charged with being “impaired through alcohol.”
The BBC identified them as Imran Zafar Syed and Jean-Francois Perrault.
The Scottish Sun said the pair had been charged under Section 93 of the United Kingdom's Railway and Transport Safety Act, an aviation regulation dealing with alcohol. The pilots were denied bail after being deemed a flight risk, the newspaper added.
Canadian aviation regulations prohibit any aircraft crew members from working while intoxicated or within eight hours of having an alcoholic drink.
Transport Canada said staff are reviewing the pilots' records and Air Transat's policies.
“As more information becomes available, the department will not hesitate to take enforcement action, including issuing fines and revoking licences if appropriate,” the federal agency said.
After arrival at Pearson, passengers said the lack of information from Air Transat and the time to get to a hotel were their main frustrations.
“It took a long time from when the problem started to making a decision,” passengerEwan Gardner said, adding they only found out about the reason for the delay a full day after the fact.
Passengers were put up in hotels and offered $200 airline vouchers.
Air Transat released a brief statement about the incident.
“We will await the results of the investigation and judicial proceedings before commenting on the matter,” the statement read. “The safety of our crews and passengers is, and will remain, a top priority at Air Transat.”
Meanwhile, McAllister and Ryan praised those responsible for reporting the situation.
“As far as we're concerned, it's better (to have) a cancelled flight and remain completely and utterly safe,” Ryan said.

Microsoft has a new way of trying to get Windows 10 onto your computer, whether you want it or not.
Users of Windows 7 and 8.1 have become familiar with -- jaded by, even -- the insistent, seemingly daily popups urging them to "Get Windows 10." Those messages have started taking a more aggressive turn.
Instead of simply giving you the option to install its latest operating system (or not), Microsoft now automatically schedules a date and time to update your PC to Windows 10. If you don't want the software update or if you want to change the installation date, you have to take deliberate action: manually click a link in the message, then choose to reschedule it or cancel it altogether.
Kinda sneaky, isn't it? Especially compared with the messages you've been seeing. If you click the OK button, thinking you're just getting rid of the message, the automatic update is scheduled. You'll then find Windows 10 on your PC sometime over the next several days without realizing that you agreed to it.
"We updated Windows 10 to a 'Recommended' update for Windows 7 & 8.1 customers whose Windows settings are configured to accept 'Recommended' updates on Thursday, May 12, 2016," a Microsoft spokesperson said. "We added the additional notification based on user feedback and to ensure customers had an opportunity to change or cancel the schedule for the upgrade to Windows 10."
Following the debacle of the little-loved Windows 8, Microsoft has been working hard to convince people to jump to Windows 10, which is available for free to users of Windows 7 or 8.1. That freebie, though, is due to end July 29, the one-year anniversary of version 10's debut. After that date, people will have to pay to upgrade. In other words, they'll have even less incentive.
The latest version of Windows has been making inroads. Earlier this month, Microsoft announced that Windows 10 had found a home on 300 million active devices, a tally that includes PCs, phones and the Xbox One game console. That's nearly a third of the way to the software giant's goal of reaching 1 billion Windows 10 devices within two to three years of the software's release.
Likewise, Windows 10 leapfrogged both Windows 8.1 and the aging, enduring Windows XP earlier this year to become the second most widely used version of the software that once defined personal computing for many. Windows 7 remains top dog, accounting for nearly 50 percent of desktops running versions of the operating system.
After July 29, upgrading to the Home version of Windows 10 will cost $119, while the Pro flavor will be priced at $199. Oh, and sneaking in there sometime this summer, possibly in July, will be another freebie offer: the Windows 10 Anniversary edition, sporting enhancements to the Cortana personal assistant and the Hello login feature, along with support for the HoloLens augmented-reality headset.
Once a Netflix skeptic, Time Warner has struck its biggest deal yet to allow the online service to license its television content.
On Thursday, the Warner Brothers Television Group of Time Warner and the CBS Corporation announced a $1 billion deal that will give Netflix the rights to stream shows broadcast on the CW network for at least the next eight years.
Eight dramas currently shown on the youth-oriented CW network, a joint venture between CBS and Warner Bros, will be available for streaming beginning as early as Oct. 15. They include “The Vampire Diaries” and “Gossip Girl.”
The deal results from a yearlong evolution at Time Warner in which the chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, established a set of guidelines for monetizing content via subscription streaming services like Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime.
“Our rules included bypassing the quick and easy money,” Mr. Bewkes said in an interview on Thursday. “We established a strategy to responsibly work with Netflix.”
That strategy included not separating the rights to TV shows so that the same show could be sold into syndication on a traditional TV network and, then, at a diminished rate, to an online subscription service.
Mr. Bewkes came under criticism last year when they argued that Netflix's potential was overhyped. They compared the Web service to “the Albanian Army” taking over the world.
The Warner Brothers-CBS deal speaks to a continuing evolution, Mr. Bewkes said, adding that the way media companies were cheaply licensing content to online video-on-demand services did not make sense.
They said they envisioned Netflix and other services as a means to make money on shows like those on the CW, which are heavily serialized and would not lead to multimillion-dollar traditional syndication deals like those for CBS's “Big Bang Theory” or “Mentalist,” both produced by Warner Brothers.
At any point while the Netflix deal is in effect, Warner Brothers and CBS will have the opportunity to shop CW shows around for traditional syndication deals.
The CW's audience of viewers ages 18 to 34 prompted the companies to explore an online on-demand deal, since younger viewers often prefer to watch TV on laptops or iPads or via streaming. The concept fits what Mr. Bewkes has dubbed “TV Everywhere,” an industrywide push to make money off content while making it available on any device.
In a statement, Leslie Moonves, chief executive at the CBS Corporation, said the deal opened a new revenue stream for CW shows. “It also further illustrates how new distribution systems are providing premium content suppliers with additive revenue streams while still preserving traditional monetization windows.”
But don't expect CBS or Warner Brothers to make its hit big-tent sitcoms or dramas readily available online. Syndication deals for network shows represent a huge revenue stream for Warner Brothers and bring in big dollars to networks. Last year, Warner Brothers sold “The Big Bang Theory” for a record $2 million per episode to Time Warner's TBS and Fox.
“We're talking billions of dollars, so to go and put those shows out essentially on a table in the street is not a good idea,” Mr. Bewkes said.
Between an unpopular price increase, the removal of some popular films and a botched plan to separate the DVD-by-mail arm of its business, Netflix has had an exceptionally hard few months. The price increase, which affected about half of its subscribers, was intended in part to raise more money for content licenses like the one announced on Thursday, a company spokesperson said.
“We're always negotiating with networks and studios,” said the spokesperson, Steve Swasey.
They rebuffed a suggestion that the deal with the CW was quickly completed to counter some of the recent bad news headlines. “These deals take a long time to consummate,” they said.
At midday Thursday, Netflix stock had risen about 2.2 percent, to $116.11.
Microsoft is offering users a compelling deal to switch to its upcoming Windows 8 system: Those who already use Windows XP, Vista or 7 can get their hands on the professional version of the software for just $40. Well, $39.99.
The deal, according to Microsoft, will be good in 131 markets.
While the price isn't quite as good as Apple's upcoming $19.99 upgrade to Mountain Lion, though still better than the current Windows 7 upgrade price of $199.99.
As you might expect from such a low price, the $40 upgrade will only be available online as a download from windows.com. If you prefer a disc, you can also pay $15 for a backup disc or just buy a $60 upgrade version in Microsoft stores.
This provides a clear incentive for Microsoft users to make the leap to Windows 8, particularly for those who never left the comfort of Windows XP. According to the analysis site NetMarketShare, about 40 percent of computers are still running Windows XP, just 1 percent ahead of the 39 percent market share from Windows 7.
Users running XP will only be able to take their personal files with them through the Windows upgrade. Windows Vista users will be able to bring their Windows settings and personal files; Windows 7 users can bring their settings, files and apps.
If you want to reformat your hard drive before upgrading, Microsoft said, you can do that from within the setup wizard that comes with the upgrade download.
Microsoft is making a big bet with Windows 8, which is supposed to help the company keep its PC sensibilities while making its push into the tablet market with the introduction of the Surface.
The company has to fight not only for tablet share, but also to boost growth in the PC market, which has returned to growth but very slowly. Growth rates for Windows PCs are particularly small, as Apple has managed to stay ahead of market growth. According to a chart shared Monday by Asymco analyst Horace Deidu, the ratio of PCs to Macs is the lowest it has been since 1985.
On Monday, Microsoft announced that it will take a $6.2 billion hit on its fourth fiscal quarter by writing down the value of its ads acquisition, aQuantive. According to a company release, the acquisition “did not accelerate growth to the degree anticipated,” prompting Microsoft to lower its value. Analysts had projected a $5.3 billion profit for Microsoft — now it may face a loss on its books.
But analysts say it's not a good idea to count Microsoft out quite yet. With the content it has on the Xbox, its push into mobile, growth in search with Bing and the possibility of a hit with Surface, Microsoft's not out of any game quite yet.
Or, as Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in an earnings call in January of the mobile market: “There's a horse in Redmond that always suits up and always runs, and will keep running.”

Years of worsening rainfall have created crisis conditions, leading families to fight to protect water, police say
By Shuriah Niazi
BHOPAL, India, June 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Imrat Namdev and their younger sister Pushpa Namdev were neighbours in Chhatarpur district, in the drought-hit Indian region of Bundelkhand. Both relied on the same well for water and, according to police, frequently quarrelled over how much the other was using.
In May, during one fight over water, Pushpa, 42, beat Imrat, 48, with a stick, police say. The injured sister was rushed to a hospital, but died there, and Pushpa was charged with murder.
"Our village faces a severe shortage of potable water," Imrat's son, Jitendra, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "Pushpa always felt my mother drew more water from the well."
As northern and central India continue to suffer thorough severe drought and oppressive heat, police in Bundelkhand and several other regions are reporting a rise in violent - and often deadly - clashes over water.
After almost 10 years of below-average rainfall and several consecutive years of drought, the region's rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wells are drying up.
Disputes are a common problem in many places in India that face water shortages. But Indian police report that the fighting is getting more frequent and bloody. In many parts of the country, neighbours, friends and family are turning on each other, desperate to protect what little water they have left, police records suggest.
Last month, in the tribal-dominated Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh, 13-year-old Surmada, their brother and their uncle used a neighbour's hand-pump, without permission, to get water for the family's houseguests.
According to police, the owner of the pump and their son attacked the group with arrows. One pierced Surmada's eye, killing them
And in the village of Kanker, in Shivpuri district, a large-scale argument broke out after two motorcyclists got into an accident, causing one to spill the 15-litre (4 gallon) container of water they were carrying.
"The two later called their family members and friends and attacked each other with spears, axes and sticks," said investigating officer Jaisingh Yadav of Sathanwada police station. Fifteen people were injured, five of them women, they said.
Lal Singh Arya, Madhya Pradesh's urban administration and development minister, said the government is using all its resources to try to make sure everyone has water. But they predicted tensions will remain high until monsoon rains - which began recently in some areas - take hold.
"There have been disputes over water in many parts of the state because of two consecutive droughts," they said. "The situation will improve with the monsoon rains."
ONLY DRINKING WATER
Activists say the government's failure to act to better manage water is partly to blame for the rise in violence.
"The present crisis is the fallout of over-consumption, wasteful use and inefficient water governance systems," said Ajay Dubey, an activist with the environmental non-governmental organisation Prayatna, based in Madhya Pradesh.
"People are going to any lengths for the sake of water. They've lost hope that the situation will ever improve. Things were never so bad," Dubey said.
According to the Madhya Pradesh water resource department, out of the state's 139 main reservoirs, 82 are at only 10 percent capacity and 22 are empty. As authorities try to make the remaining water last until monsoon rains help refill the reservoirs, the measures they have implemented have only exacerbated the sense of desperation.
Across much of the region, authorities have banned the use of water for washing cars or trucks, bathing cattle or irrigating crops. In most cities in Madhya Pradesh, the local government only supplies drinking water on one out of every two to seven days.
The district administration of Sehore in Madhya Pradesh has temporarily taken charge of all water sources, whether government or privately owned, so that it can manage use of the dwindling resource. And in three towns in Madhya Pradesh, the use of water for anything other than drinking is banned.
Lokesh Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate of Ichhawar town, said water can't be used for farming or industrial purposes until July 5, when the monsoon is underway and authorities hope water sources will be replenished.
For many in rural India, the struggle to survive with very little water is proving too difficult. In areas like Bundelkhand, a growing number of people are leaving their homes and abandoning their work in hopes of finding water - even just a little more - somewhere else.
Asandi Das, who lives in a village in Chhatarpur district, plans to take their family to Agra, where the famous Taj Mahal is located, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. They said that right now their family has neither food nor water.
They know it won't be easy even in Agra - or anywhere else - but hopes to get enough work to make ends meet.
"We'll not be able to survive in our village," Das said. "There's just no water. We'll have to go to some other place if we want to live."

Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough on MSNBC's Morning Joe (via YouTube)
But it's not objective, either.
Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC's Morning Joe, had an unfortunate turn of phrase the other day. They said it's the mission of the press to “control exactly what people think.”
My suspicion is that this was less a Freudian slip than a simple slip-up. Brzezinski was referring to their fear that President Trump may be trying to control the way people think by discrediting the media — whom they call “enemies of the American people” — and they lost their rhetorical footing, stumbling into saying that mind control is “our job.”

But the misstatement resonated with a lot of people, as did Trump's claim that the press is an enemy of the people.
The first thing that needs to be said is that whenever you hear a politician talk about “the American people,” either they're over-generalizing to the point of banality, or they're referring to only one segment of the American public. “The American people love an underdog” is an example of banality. The press “is the enemy of the American people” is a highly subjective declaration.
I don't blame journalists for taking offense. It was a grossly irresponsible thing for the chief constitutional officer of our government to say. But that doesn't mean they don't have a point or that people are crazy for seeing it.

Which brings me back to Brzezinski's comment about the media's controlling how people think.

One need not paint with an overly broad brush or accuse the entire press corps of being part of a knowing conspiracy to manipulate the public. Many mainstream journalists sincerely believe they are operating in good faith and doing their job to the best of their abilities. At the same time, it seems patently obvious that the “objective” press is in the business of subjectively shaping attitudes rather than simply reporting facts.
Consider the hot topic of the moment: illegal immigration. The syndicate that distributes the column you are reading follows the AP stylebook, which says that I am not allowed to refer to “illegal immigrants” (i.e., people who migrate illegally), but I can refer to illegal immigration (i.e., the act of migrating illegally). Kathleen Carroll, then the senior vice president and executive editor of the Associated Press, explained that the change was part of the AP's policy against “labeling people.”
Many news outlets followed suit, using such terms as “unauthorized” or “undocumented” to describe immigrants formerly known as illegal.

The move was hailed by left-wing immigration activists as a great leap forward. And for good reason: It is part of their agenda to blur the distinctions between legal and illegal immigration, and to make it sound as if objecting to the former is morally equivalent to objecting to the latter. But as a matter of fact and logic, the difference between an “unauthorized immigrant” and an “illegal immigrant” is nonexistent.
The media play these kinds of linguistic games all the time. Economics professor Tim Groseclose walks readers through countless examples in their book Left Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind. Partial-birth abortion virtually never appears without a “so-called” before it, and the procedure is virtually never described clearly. The word “kill” is almost never used to describe any abortion, despite the fact that this is what happens. Whenever some great sweeping piece of liberal social legislation is passed by Democrats, it's a “step forward.” Whenever a law is repealed, Republicans are “turning back the clock.”
The language games are part of a larger tendency of journalists to follow certain scripts that conform to how coastal elites see the country.

In 2015, during the ridiculous hysteria over Indiana's religious-freedom law (since revised), a news reporter went around a small town asking business owners about the law. The owner of Memories Pizza, Crystal O'Connor, said anyone could eat there, but they'd probably turn down a job to cater a gay wedding. The story was immediately blown up by national news outlets as proof of some prairie fire of anti-gay discrimination, even though no one had been discriminated against. Memories Pizza had to shut down.
My hunch is that O'Connor nodded along when Trump said the press is the enemy of the American people.
0 FBI joins investigation at Karen Handel's house
ROSWELL, Ga. - Authorities were called to the neighborhood where Karen Handel lives in Roswell after suspicious envelopes were found in mailboxes Thursday afternoon.
Police say Roxburg Drive off Old Alabama Road was shut down for several hours while crews investigated.
At least five homes in the neighborhood received an envelope with a "white powdery substance" in it.
The FBI was called in to take the lead on the investigation.

One woman opened the envelope, found a white powdery substance inside and called police Thursday afternoon. Neighbors said the envelope also contained a threatening letter.
"It's been a rather harrowing experience to hear that this even happened," resident Dave Quinn said.
“We take all these threats seriously. We've been having a lot of issues with political signs over the past months. This has just been a situation over the campaign on both sides. We do not know the nature of the substance right now," said Lisa Holland with the Roswell Police Department.
Handel said a statement on their Facebook page that they received one of those envelopes and is thankful for the support they have received during the investigation:
No illnesses have been reported from the envelopes.
Holland said the postal inspector has been notified because of concern for the mail carrier who delivered the mail.
Police asked neighbors to call 911 if they find anything in their mail without a return address.

Handel is the Republican candidate running for Georgia's 6th Congressional District against Democrat Jon Ossoff.
The Ossoff campaign told Channel 2 Action News that campaign staff and the Ossoff family have also received multiple threats of violence during this election. Today, they hired a security detail.
6TH DISTRICT RACE
The 6th District Congressional Race has been a hotly contested race that has received national attention.
Handel and Ossoff are running to replace the seat left vacant by Tom Price when they were named Health and Human Services Secretary.
There are currently three seats in Congress that have been left vacant from appointments made by the Trump administration.
The seats are not enough to sway the majority of the House, but many looking at the race for the 6th District as a referendum on the Trump administration.
The Ossoff campaign told Channel 2 Action News that campaign staff and the Ossoff family have also received multiple threats of violence during this election. Today, they hired a security detail.
Last week, the man who opened fire on a GOP baseball game in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, posted about Handel on their Facebook page about the comment they made during WSB-TV's 6th District Debate about a livable wage.
"It's really disturbing for people to be going about their day to serve the people of this country and to have what is seemingly raw politics drive someone to such an act," Handel said at the time.
The election for the 6th District is Tuesday.

Rick Hasen teaches over at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. He's an election law expert, actually, and they don't like what he's seeing from this campaign season. Case in point:
Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead they are running for president in what looks like a rigged election — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2016
For a while now, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been saying that the media, which they claimed is controlled by opponent Hillary Clinton, is helping rig this election. But not only that:
“So important that you get out and vote,” they said during a rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. “So important that you watch other communities, because we don't want this election stolen from us. We don't want this election stolen from us. We do not want this election stolen.”
And at another rally in Wilke-Barre, Pennsylvania:
“We have to make sure the people of Philadelphia are protected that the vote counts are 100 percent,” they said. “Everybody wants that, but I hear these horror shows. I hear these horror shows and we have to make sure that this election is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us. And everybody knows what I'm talking about.”
The Washington Post's Philip Bump has argued that such statements are racially charged, meant to take advantage of anti-black racism.
In any case, Trump is carrying on with the “rigged” idea with the Saturday morning tweet.
Not Good, Hasen responded in a blog post. They said Trump is using racist sentiment to cause voter intimidation and reduce faith in the electoral process.
Trump has been making these statements for months, essentially claiming without any credible evidence whatsoever that racial minorities and labor unions in Democratic areas like Philadelphia will use voter impersonation. Trump's comments are a natural outgrowth of the kind of voter fraud hysteria we've seen from some Republicans for the last decade and a half. Trump's comments are especially dangerous because they are encouraging their supporters to take matters into their own hands. He's telling their supporters to go to “certain areas” looking for fraud at the polls. This means a real risk of voter intimidation even if Trump themselves organizes nothing. There will be people in red shirts marching to the polls.
They follow the lead of another law professor, Ned Foley, who went as far as to call out House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch Connell (R-Kentucky) to declare that Trump has already lost.
“They should not be wimps,” Hasen wrote. “They should condemn this rhetoric as dangerous and say that we all, Democrats and Republicans and those of minor or no parties, support the rule of law. We will all accept the results of the election. And Donald Trump's comments are dangerous and irresponsible.”
Might this happen? Ryan, despite saying they won't campaign for Trump anymore, has yet to actively unendorse him, and if they do, he'd pretty much be the last Republican to do so. McConnell continues to essentially back Trump, but he's reportedly staying out of all the election year struggle.
We've reached out to the Trump campaign, and McConnell for their response. Ryan too, though they have commented on Trump's “rigged” comments.

Dr Bryan Fry is Deputy Director of the University of Melbourne's Australian Venom Research Unit and their discovery has shaken the foundations of reptile evolution, opened the door for a new class of novel drugs and, as many of these assumed harmless snakes are sold in pet stores worldwide, is causing experts to re-evaluate the relative danger of non-venomous snakes.
Their findings appear in the journal Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry (August 2003), the Journal of Molecular Evolution (October 2003) and Molecular Biology and Evolution (in press). Fry has also received an Australian Research Council (ARC) grant of $250,000 over three years to continue this research.
Dr Fry is fascinated by venomous snakes and venom evolution. Last year they set off on a worldwide herpetological adventure to track down when and in what snake venom first evolved. The result was the ground-breaking discovery that snake venom developed only once in evolution and it did so about 60 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought, and before the snakes we commonly think of as non-venomous even arrived on the scene.
"Contrary to popular belief, venom appears to have evolved at about the same time as advanced snakes started to appear. Even fangs and large venom glands arrived much later," says Dr Fry.
"This means the first venomous snakes evolved from the heavy-bodied swamp monsters similar to the anacondas of today. These snakes traded in their heavy muscle for speed and agility. Venom rather than muscle became the tool necessary for these snakes to capture their prey," they say.
The consequence of this is that venom is an inherent condition of virtually all advanced snakes, and that includes the assumed non-venomous species.
Dr Fry has now analysed the venoms from the many different snake lineages collected from their worldwide hunt and elsewhere, some of these were common pet-store snakes. They discovered that their venoms are just as complex as venoms from some of the world's deadliest snakes such as the cobras, puff adders and taipans.
"Some non-venomous snakes have been previously thought to have only mild 'toxic saliva'. But these results suggest that they actually possess true venoms," says Dr Fry.
"We even isolated from a rat snake, a snake common in pet stores, a typical cobra-style neurotoxin, one that is as potent as comparative toxins found in close relatives of the cobra," they say.
Fry's worldwide wandering has also boosted the number of what were previously assumed to be non-venomous snakes from a mere few hundred to more than 2000.
These snakes typically have smaller quantities of venom and lack fangs, but they can still deliver their venom via their numerous sharp teeth," says Dr Fry.
"But not all of these snakes are dangerous. It does mean, however, that we need to re-evaluate the relative danger of non-venomous snakes," they say.
Dr Fry trekked from Madagascar to Melbourne, dived for sea snakes in the remote South Pacific Islands, explored caves, climbed trees and milked over 2,000 snakes a year to gather their research findings.
"It was extreme science, but I had a complete blast doing it," they say.
As well as the evolutionary revelations, Dr Fry has also uncovered a vast range of new and unstudied toxins for toxinologists.
"The natural pharmacology that exists witihin animal venoms is a tremendous resource waiting to be tapped," they say.
"The toxin isolated from the ratsnake is an excellent candidate for use as a laboratory tool or even as a scaffold for use in drug design and development. The medical community may also benefit by exploring the effects of these unknown toxins in the human body."

THERE IS life after a cancer diagnosis. It's not all pleasant, but as Mike Marqusee shows us in The Price of Experience: Writings on Living with Cancer, it is not necessary, or even healthy, to accept the enforced isolation of most treatment regimens.
Marqusee, who has already exceeded the prognosis for their multiple myeloma by several years, widens our understanding of what such a diagnosis means for the patient caught up in the complex world of the cancer industry. This is not a confessional cancer story, but a provocative examination of what having cancer in the 21st century can tell us about social relationships, and what an encounter with mortality might achieve.
To begin, the author rejects the common approach to the cancer story, which often portrays the patient bravely battling the disease. This battle often suggests an isolated, lonely existence--and, when the patient succumbs, personal failure. The ideology of fighting cancer, Marqusee notes, "mirrors the bootstrap individualism of the neoliberal order, in which the poor are poor because of their own weaknesses."
Mike Marqusee
Marqusee's cancer was diagnosed in 2007. Since that time, they have gone through multiple regimens, including two bone marrow transplants provided by their sister. While we learn about their treatments and their progress, we learn a great deal more about health care in the neoliberal era. Marqusee's approach takes us beyond the pain of chemotherapy and probing needles, into the complex relationships of patient, medical staff and even "the circling vultures," like "travel insurers who charge people with cancer 10 times the rate charged to others."
By broadening their understanding of where they stand in relation to the social, political and economic forces of modern health care, Marqusee finds another therapeutic regimen. Indeed, their relational medicine is a powerful antidote for the isolated patient trapped in a world with no seeming control.
Marqusee challenges the assumptions that govern much of cancer treatment. Making cancer treatment "less brutal would be a huge stride forward for people with cancer. And that requires not a top-down military strategy, with its win-or-lose approach, but greater access to information, wider participation in decision-making across hierarchies and disciplines, and empowerment of the patient."
Review: Books Mike Marqusee, The Price of Experience: Writings on Living with Cancer. OR Books, 2014, 106 pages, $13.
AS A transplanted American, Marqusee is well aware of the differences between the health care systems of the two countries they have called home.
For example, Britain's National Health Service (NHS) flew their sister from California to London because they were vital to their care. There is much more to learn in the chapter "A Tale of Two Health Systems": for example, "of the two million Americans who went bankrupt because of medical bills in 2008, three-quarters had health insurance."
Yet for all its benefits and superior care, the NHS is under attack and facing severe reductions in services. This will affect all involved, but not equally. For example, the bondholders, who bet on hospital construction, will not lose. Their profits are assured by the trusts that oversee the various hospitals and clinics. Or as Marqusee puts it, "hospitals like Barts will not be run for profit, but by profit."
To help us understand the impending damage that will be done to St. Bartholomew Hospital--the author's treatment center--we learn some of the history of this august institution, established in 1123, making it "the world's longest-established provider of free medical care to the poor."
No part of the health care complex gets more scorn than "big pharma." Indeed, this industry holds the whole system hostage. With its average profit margin of 17 percent, the drug companies have no equal in the care industry. Marqusee's current drug regimen is Revlimid and costs the NHS nearly $9,000 for a 5 milligram, 21-day cycle. "Who knew multiple myeloma could be such a money-spinner?"
Understanding, the role of big pharma in their treatment elicits not submission but resentment: "The way my illness, my vulnerability, has been exploited, used by a group of self-serving parasites to gouge the public purse."
Marqusee has nothing but gratitude for the care he's been given. Their gratitude does not stop with doctors and nurses, but includes the porters, janitors and even the researchers who began the search for treatments and cures for their cancer in the 1840s. As they put it, "I'm being kept alive by the contributions of so many currents of human labor, thought, struggle, desire, imagination." It is this broader sense of community that raises The Price of Experience above other cancer survival stories.
In the end, what Marqusee has given us is a dialectics of illness. They approach their care, not with resignation, but with a spirit of engagement and a connection to the complexities of modern health care. From a plea for health care providers not to be used by the money managers just because compassion is their calling, to a wonderful appreciation of the contradiction in seeking independence through a community of struggle, Marqusee outlines a survival strategy for all of us.
As they write: "What we need is not a 'war on cancer,' but a recognition that cancer is a social and environmental issue, and can only be fully addressed through far-reaching economic and political change."
Claim: An ongoing outbreak of Enterovirus D68 originated with an influx of immigrant children from Central America.
PROBABLY FALSE
Example: [Collected via e-mail, October 2014]
An article at examiner.com states that the Enterovirus D 68 (EV-D68) is the ‘open border flu', caused by children sent (across the border) to the interior of the country, and ‘without any medical exams, being allowed to register for public school'. An article at examiner.com states that theis the ‘open border flu', caused by children sent (across the border) to the interior of the country, and ‘without any medical exams, being allowed to register for public school'. The CDC does not mention this disease as a ‘border flu'… and if it were a border problem, I would expect more border states to have higher illness rates, like California and Texas! What are your thoughts?
I have read recently about cases of Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) occurring in immigrant children … sometimes with fatal results.
Origins: An outbreak of Enterovirus D68
first tracked by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in mid-August 2014 began in the Midwest and rapidly spread to nearly every state. By October 2014 nearly 700 confirmed cases had been cited by the CDC, and at least one young child is believed to have died of the virus on 10 October 2014 in New Jersey.
The sudden appearance of Enterovirus D68 prompted much speculation as to the means with which the aggressive strain had entered the public health sphere. After cases were first confirmed in Chicago and Kansas City, Missouri, the virus moved east and popped up in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York. Like the majority of viruses, Enterovirus has no known treatment or cure and must simply run its course while symptoms of the virus are treated individually.
As the number of EV-D68 cases rose, rumors began to circulate suggesting that the outbreak was connected to a particular event: an influx of minor children crossing the United States border unaccompanied by parents or guardians that peaked in 2014. The proximity of the wave of minor immigrants and the resurgence of Enterovirus led many to conclude the children brought the strain from their home countries and caused the outbreak.
Some pundits placed blame for the outbreak of EV-D68 and a recent case of Ebola in Dallas at the feet of President Obama. Phyllis Schlafly said:
There are all kinds of diseases in the rest of the world, and we don't want them in this country. And it's Obama's job to keep them out. There are all kinds of diseases in the rest of the world, and we don't want them in this country. And it's Obama's job to keep them out. Out of all the things he's done, I think this thing of letting these diseased people into this country to infect our own people is just the most outrageous of all. That was the purpose of Ellis Island — to have a waiting place where it was decided whether people were healthy enough or responsible enough to come into our country. The idea that anybody can just walk in and carry this disease with them is just an outrage, and it is Obama's fault because he's responsible for doing it. Obama doesn't want America to believe that we're exceptional. They want us to be just like everybody else, and if Africa is suffering from Ebola, we ought to join the group and be suffering from it, too. That's their attitude.
Fueling speculation in part was a research article published in 2013 in Virology Journal titled “Human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in influenza-like illness in Latin America.” That study was often referenced in such rumors despite the fact it did not specifically address a higher prevalence of such illnesses in the Central/Latin America region. Many readers mistakenly conflated the location of the study's participants with the location of an epidemic or geographic predilection for contracting and transmitting the virus, when in actuality Latin America was simply the place from which data was collected for the research.
The rumor was addressed by MLive after the claim spread heavily in Michigan. Experts explained that Enterovirus strains have been in the United States for more than 50 years, with EV-D68 first being detected in 1987:
Enterovirus was first detected in the United States in 1962, according to the CDC. The specific EV-D68 strain was first detected in 1987, said Eden Wells, Clinical Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Enterovirus was first detected in the United States in 1962, according to the CDC. The specificstrain was first detected in 1987, said Eden Wells, Clinical Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “I think that this really sort of argues against the fact that this is a new virus introduced by anybody,” Wells said. Dr. Matthew Davis, the state's Chief Medical Executive with the Michigan Department of Community Health, said that “While it's theoretically possible that someone from any part of the world can bring an infection to another part of the world, it seems unlikely that children from Central America have brought this particular enterovirus strain into the United States.”
Media figures such as Schlafly and Pat Robertson have speculated that the EV-D68 outbreak started with immigrant children, with Robertson blaming minor migrants who have carried “with them viruses that we were not familiar with in the United States and haven't built up immunity to.” Given that the particular strain of the virus now affecting Americans was recorded in the U.S. as far back as 1987, the claim that the current outbreak of Enterovirus D68 is due solely or primarily to that strain's being carried to the U.S. by immigrant children is a problematic one.

LONDON (Reuters) - Staff at the Dinnington library are used to people bringing books back late but the package they received last month was in a class of its own.
It contained a paperback first edition copy of “Quatermass and the Pit” by Nigel Kneale which had been borrowed on September 24, 1965.
“I thought at first it was just a normal return, until I saw the color of the pages: they were very brown around the edges,” said Alison Lawrie, the Principal Library Assistant.
“It's true that some people like to take their time with a good book, but 45 years is an incredible amount of time!”
Staff believe the book was borrowed from the old Dinnington Library, in Sheffield, South Yorkshire which opened in 1936 and is close to the current building which opened in 2000.
However, the identity of the borrower remains a mystery because records do not go back that far — and there would have been no danger of a huge accumulated fine because all fines are capped at 6 pounds ($9).
“The person who posted it back to us would not be in any ‘trouble' whatsoever,” said Lawrie. “If the person who returned the book wants to come forward, we'd love to know the story behind it.”
Microsoft wants to imprison you in its forthcoming Windows 8 devices.
Microsoft and its vendor friends said that there's no Windows 8 plot to lock other operating systems from Windows 8 devices, but now we know Microsoft was not telling the whole truth.
Journalist Glyn Moody dug around Microsoft's Windows Hardware Certification Requirements for Windows 8 client and server systems and found on page 116 that will Windows 8 Secure Boot can be disabled: on Intel systems, "Disabling Secure [Boot] must not be possible on ARM systems."
What does that mean? According to Aaron Williamson, a lawyer with the Software Freedom Law Center an organization that provides pro-bono legal services to developers of Free and open-source software, Microsoft has wasted no time in effectively banning most alternative operating systems on ARM-based devices that ship with Windows 8.
Microsoft will be doing this by using Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), to block block all other operating systems from Windows 8 systems. UEFI is the 21st century's replacement to PC and other devices' BIOS. It's used to set up your computer and make it ready to boot.
Williamson explains, "The Certification Requirements define ... a 'custom' secure boot mode, in which a physically present user can add signatures for alternative operating systems to the system's signature database, allowing the system to boot those operating systems. But for ARM devices, Custom Mode is prohibited: 'On an ARM system, it is forbidden to enable Custom Mode. Only Standard Mode may be enabled." [sic] Nor will users have the choice to simply disable secure boot, as they will on non-ARM systems: "Disabling Secure [Boot] MUST NOT be possible on ARM systems.' [sic] Between these two requirements, any ARM device that ships with Windows 8 will never run another operating system, unless it is signed with a preloaded key or a security exploit is found that enables users to circumvent secure boot."
In short, Microsoft insists that any Windows 8 ARM-powered device can not be rebooted or rooted with the user's choice of operating system. And you thought rooting some Android phones was troublesome!
Williamson went on to say that while "While UEFI secure boot is ostensibly about protecting user security, these non-standard restrictions have nothing to do with security. For non-ARM systems, Microsoft requires that Custom Mode be enabled-a perverse demand if Custom Mode is a security threat. But the ARM market is different for Microsoft in three important respects"
These are:
Microsoft's hardware partners are different for ARM. ARM is of interest to Microsoft primarily for one reason: all of the handsets running the Windows Phone operating system are ARM-based. By contrast, Intel rules the PC world. There, Microsoft's secure boot requirements-which allow users to add signatures in Custom Mode or disable secure boot entirely-track very closely to the recommendations of the UEFI Forum, of which Intel is a founding member. Microsoft doesn't need to support legacy Windows versions on ARM. If Microsoft locked unsigned operating systems out of new PCs, it would risk angering its own customers who prefer Windows XP or Windows 7 (or, hypothetically, Vista). With no legacy versions to support on ARM, Microsoft is eager to lock users out. Microsoft doesn't control sufficient market share on mobile devices to raise antitrust concerns. While Microsoft doesn't command quite the monopoly on PCs that it did in 1998, when it was prosecuted for antitrust violations, it still controls around 90% of the PC operating system market-enough to be concerned that banning non-Windows operating systems from Windows 8 PCs will bring regulators knocking. Its tiny stake in the mobile market may not be a business strategy, but for now it may provide a buffer for its anticompetitive behavior there.
It doesn't have to be this way. As Williamson points out UEFI's secure boot isn't meant to be used to block user's choice. In addition, the Linux Foundation has explained in detail how UEFI secure boot could be implemented by Microsoft so that freedom of choice would be preserved.
Microsoft isn't listening. The Linux Foundation made its proposal in October; Microsoft published its document in December. As Williamson said, "It is clear now that opportunism, not philosophy, is guiding Microsoft's secure boot policy."
Don't think this is about smartphones and thus, given Microsoft's tiny share of the smartphone market of no real importance. Williamson concluded, "Before this week, this policy might have concerned only Windows Phone customers. But just yesterday, Qualcomm announced plans to produce Windows 8 tablets and ultrabook-style laptops built around its ARM-based Snapdragon processors. Unless Microsoft changes its policy, these may be the first PCs ever produced that can never run anything but Windows, no matter how Qualcomm feels about limiting its customers' choices. SFLC predicted in our comments to the Copyright Office that misuse of UEFI secure boot would bring such restrictions, already common on smartphones, to PCs. Between Microsoft's new ARM secure boot policy and Qualcomm's announcement, this worst-case scenario is beginning to look inevitable."
That's the one point I disagree with Williamson on. This isn't the worse case. The worse case is that Microsoft decides, "What the heck" and introduces lock out style UEFI secure booting on Intel PCs. While flirting with fire from the anti-trust action, I wouldn't put it pass them.

Twitter's most recent update allows you to broadcast live video.
This isn't new, exactly. But now, you no longer need a Periscope account to do so -- you can do it directly from Twitter.
Periscope has been Twitter's live tool of choice since March 2015 (remember Meerkat before that?). However, as Facebook Live has exploded in popularity, Twitter has had to reckon with the fact that its live video service requires two apps, where Facebook needs just one.

No matter what happens in life, we are guaranteed some consistent beauty in this world. A blue sky unless it's cloudy or artificially shrouded. And lush greenery, for the most part. The world is bursting with vibrant color and the greens in particular can whisk us into tranquility especially if we take the time to pull the plug on virtual reality and connect to the most stable reality available to us – Nature. (The blind can plug into this beauty even if they cannot visually witness it.)

Sadly, children in the Western world may go for insane periods of time without playing in – or even seeing – green, natural surroundings. They may be trapped in schools that are high up and offer only bleakness outside the windows they stare out of. They can be carted on big buses that take highways to get to their sub-developments or apartments. They have hours of homework inside stuffy homes and later they may “escape” with television, Internet and screen time before they finally slip off into sleep. The only nature they may interact with is the fantasy of their dreamscapes.
Additionally, there are an alarmingly high number of parents being arrested for letting their children play outside.
For the first time ever…
A study emphasizes that “this is the first time that the impact of lifelong residential exposure to green spaces on attention capacity in children has been studied,” said Payam Dadvand, ISGlobal researcher and first author.
A previous ISGlobal study already indicated that green spaces within and surrounding schools could enhance cognitive development in children between 7 and 10 years of age. In the current study, the authors expanded on this finding by evaluating the impact of greenness surrounding all the residential addresses of children since birth and characterizing cognitive development at earlier stages in life.
The analysis, published in Environment Health Perspectives, was based on data from 1,500 children of the INMA – Environment and Childhood Project cohort in Sabadell and Valencia, collected during 2003-2013. The ISGlobal team analyzed residential surrounding greenness – at 100, 300 and 500 metres distance- at birth, 4-5 years and 7 years of age.
Two types of attention tests were performed at 4-5 and 7 years of age. The research shows that children with higher greenness around their homes had better scores in the attention tests.
These results “underline the importance of green areas in cities for children's health and brain development,” says Dadvand.
Jordi Sunyer, study coordinator and head of the Child Health Programme at ISGlobal, points out that “the possibility that exposure to different types of vegetation might have different impacts on neurodevelopment remains an open question.”
Therefore, the goal is to study the impact of different kinds of environments and and vegetation on the lives of children – and – we can only hope – to do something about it!
“Green spaces in cities promote social connections and physical activity and reduce exposure to air pollution and noise, and are therefore essential for the development of the future generations' brains,” added Sunyer.

Malappuram: On April 2, during a parliamentary by-election here, BJP candidate N. Sreepraksh announced to the press that if they won they would guarantee good, clean beef from air-conditioned slaughterhouses.
The statement triggered a brief controversy within the BJP, for deviating from its national agenda, but it soon blew over, because everyone knew that people in Kerala like their beef. Beef and porota are on the everyday menu at Kerala hotels; that too served from early in the morning.
In March of 2015, while politicians and intellectuals debated the beef ban in Maharashtra, I was at a RSS-BJP dominated village or ‘Sanga Gramam' in north Kerala, conducting an anthropological study of village politics. Vinayapuram (the name is changed to protect my ongoing research) had often witnessed violent clashes between the Sangh and its Marxist Left rivals from nearby villages.
There is an interesting history to how Vinayapuram acquired a rightwing-Hindu character. Earlier, the village and others nearby were known for grassroots socialist politics. In the 1970s, when the Janata Party was formed by socialist leader J.P. Narayan (uniting with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the-then political wing of RSS, plus the Congress (O) and Bharatiya Lok Dal) it became dominant in Vinayapuram. When the Janata Party broke up, the majority of socialists in the village turned to the newly-formed BJP, and to active local involvement in the RSS.
The dominant caste in the village are the Thiyya, who grew more saffronised in rituals and expressive culture, but not in their food. Thiyyas were traditionally toddy-tappers and labourers, once treated as untouchables. They and their deities still eat meat and dried fish, and drink toddy and liquor, unlike the Gods of the upper castes.
L.K. Anantha Krishna Iyer, a Raj-era anthropologist in Kerala, observed that Thiyyas were Buddhists in the time before the arrival of Brahmins. Later they were incorporated into the caste system as untouchables. In north Kerala, Thiyyas had generally leaned towards Marxism, right from the formation of the Communist Party in Kerala. Right-wing Hindu politics reached Kerala around the same time, in the early 1940s, but villages like Vinayapuram, where right-wing Hindu ideology achieved dominance, were an exception.
When I began my fieldwork, I often saw people eating porata and beef, and I often had opportunities to eat beef with RSS activists – upper-caste Nairs, as well as Thiyyas – in and around the village. It was apparent to me that most residents preferred beef when eating outside the house. Beef was even listed on the menu of a few hotels in town run by RSS members. As the news spread of the beef ban in Maharashtra, the area CPI(M) and its youth organisation seized it as an issue, organising state-wide beef festivals to campaign against the BJP and RSS. In Vinayauram, it was awkward: everybody wanted to avoid reading or hearing any news about beef. They all had eaten a lot in their past.
I remember going with Bijesh (name changed), an active worker of RSS and my key informant, to a hotel to have brunch. We had eaten beef a few times together. This time when we sat, I sensed a little discomfort. They looked around the hotel and gave an order for of fish and porota for both of us; they didn't even ask what I would prefer. The hotel was run by an active BJP worker, too: I had met them at a Gurupooja function in the village, one of the prominent ritualistic events of RSS holds every year, in which workers and loyalists pay their annual donation to the organisation alongside the puja.
Bijesh looked disappointed as we ate our porata and fish curry in the hotel. But they kept their cool. While paying the bill, they spoke to the man who runs the hotel. ‘Why you're still preparing beef here?' they asked. ‘We all are talking against it, and you are supplying it, that too in our village. What other people will think if they saw it.'
The man smiled and replied, ‘Why should I stop serving because it is banned in Maharashtra? People come here only for beef. Rather than stop serving it, it would be better to close the hotel.'
We had just left when we both heard a person sitting inside ordering in a loud voice: Chetta, randu poratta oru beef fry – Chetta, two porata and one plate beef fry!

Lake County, Ind., Sheriff's Department via AP Christopher M. Bour of Gary, Ind., is one of two people indicted this week on federal charges involving the alleged sale of a young child for use in producing child pornography.
An Indiana woman is charged in a federal indictment with selling their 1½-year-old daughter to a man they met through a dating service for child pornography, according to court documents.
Natisha Hillard, 24, and Christopher M. Bour, 39, both of Gary, are charged in the five-count grand jury indictment unsealed this week and filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Hammond.
Hillard is charged with selling their daughter to Bour knowing the girl "would be portrayed in a visual depiction assisting another person to engage in sexually explicit conduct" and with permitting the girl to participate in the production of child pornography.
Bour is charged with production of child pornography, purchasing a child for production of child pornography and possession of child pornography. The indictment says they used the toddler to "assist them to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction."
The alleged price wasn't disclosed. All of the charges are felonies.
In a criminal complaint filed in the case, the FBI said a woman whom it didn't identify approached it last month to report that Bour, whom they described as a friend, had sent their explicit text messages asking whether they were interested in joining them to "watch me play with a baby tomorrow — a real one."
According to the FBI, the woman, who previously operated a massage parlor, said they visited Bour's home to give them massages. On their second visit, which was about three weeks ago, according to the complaint, they said they saw child porn videos playing on their laptop computer.
At that point, the FBI launched a sting operation. An agent assumed the woman's identity and began new text message conversations with Bour, according to the complaint.
In extremely explicit transcripts included in the court docket, which NBC News is not publishing or linking to, the man identified in the indictment as Bour describes their love of young children and what they liked to do with them sexually.
"Its the best sex I ever had," they are quoted as having written.
At least three video files, all with obscene titles and depicting sex with prepubescent boys and girls, were found on Bour's computer, the FBI said. Image files specifically showing Bour engaging in such behavior were also recovered, the FBI said.
An adult woman could be seen in some of the photos, according to an FBI probable cause filing, which said it was able to identify them as Hillard through a telephone number on Bour's cellphone, which led to their driver's license information in state records. It said Bour confirmed that they knew the woman and said they had met them through a dating service.
Hillard and Bour were being held without bond and were scheduled to be arraigned Monday.

I can't believe we reached our goal in under 6 hours! Thank you all for your support. This was the minimum amount I needed for a first print run, so surpassing our goal means I can print even more books!
I will print as many books as are requested through Kickstarter over the next month, making the first print run of I Wonder custom ordered for all of you. I'm very much looking forward to sending you the first copies!
I Wonder
Before my daughter turned two, they began ignoring questions they couldn't answer. Then they moved on to giving answers they knew to be false. I realized that they had grown accustomed to being celebrated every time they answered a question correctly and was, naturally, less interested in exchanges that didn't produce this response. But I also realized something even more important: I hadn't taught them to say “I don't know” let alone celebrated their ability to do so.
I believe that one of the most important gifts we can give our children is the confidence to say “I don't know.” It's the foundation from which we begin our investigation of the world: asking questions, taking the necessary time to understand the answers, and searching for new answers when the ones we have in hand don't seem to work. The feeling of not knowing is also the source of wonder and awe.
In all social and emotional learning, children need our help identifying the many new feelings they experience: “Oh, that Batman costume scared you,” or “I know, you feel sad when Mommy leaves.” So I went looking for a children's book that would help me talk about the experience of not knowing with my daughter, but I couldn't find one…
The Book
I Wonder is about a little girl named Eva who takes a walk with their mother and encounters a range of mysteries – from gravity, to life cycles, to the vastness of the universe. They learn to talk about how it feels to not know something, and they learn that it's okay to say “I don't know.” Eva discovers that they have much to learn about the world and that there are many things even adults don't know – mysteries for everyone in the world to wonder about together!
I Wonder is a 24-page picture book for children ages one and up, and it is designed to appeal to parents as much as to their kids. It is intended as a guide for parents who are beginning a conversation with their children that will evolve over many years.
The Artwork
One of the most important steps in writing this book was choosing the right artist to work with. After much searching, I discovered John Rowe. John creates original art and oil paintings for a wide range of clients including the United Nations, Disney, Random House, Simon and Schuster, and Buena Vista Pictures. Their work vividly communicates a feeling of awe, and they have already made important contributions to Eva's story.
The book pages for I Wonder will be full color prints of John's oil paintings. John is still in the early stages of creating the illustrations for I Wonder, but here are a few of their initial “compilation sketches” on which the oil paintings will be based:

Compilation Sketch #2
Compilation Sketch #3
Why
We live in a society where people are uncomfortable with not knowing. Children aren't taught to say “I don't know,” and honesty in this form is rarely modeled for them. They too often see adults avoiding questions and fabricating answers, out of either embarrassment or fear, and this comes at a price. To solve the world's most challenging problems, we need innovative minds that are inspired in the presence of uncertainty. Let's support parents and educators who are raising the next generation of creative thinkers.
I've decided to self-publish I Wonder, which is why I am launching this project on Kickstarter. It's important to me to maintain careful control over all the elements of the book – from the story, to the illustrations, to the quality of the paper. I want to create the most beautiful book I can, while staying true to its message.
The most expensive part of the publishing process is the actual printing of the books, so I'm raising money for my first print run of I Wonder by selling copies in advance. Those of you who support this Kickstarter campaign will receive the first copies of I Wonder to read to your children or to give as gifts to your friends.
Let's celebrate the feelings of awe and wonder in our children, as the foundation for all learning. Let's teach children to say “I don't know” and help them understand the power behind it. And let's be honest with children about the limits of our own knowledge. There is so much for all of us to wonder about together!
I hope you enjoy the book, and I want to thank you for helping me bring it to press.
The Halalt First Nation and its business partners are suing Catalyst Paper, alleging that a 59-year-old mill is trespassing and that the company has disclosed sensitive information, despite signing a confidentiality agreement.
The paper and pulp company, based in Richmond, .B.C., says it denies the allegations contained in two separate civil suits and plans to defend itself vigorously.
Among other things, it says the trespassing suit is seeking $2 billion and a permanent order to prevent Catalyst from conducting operations at the Crofton Mill on the southeast coast of Vancouver Island, near Duncan, B.C.
Catalyst says the Halalt First Nation claims the Crofton mill — operating since 1957 — interferes with its water and land rights and has caused damage to fisheries and land within the Halalt's territory.
A second suit filed by the Halalt, Sunvault Energy Inc. and Aboriginal Power Corp. seeks $100 million from Catalyst and an order from court to permanently stop Catalyst from building, owning or operating an anaerobic digester facility.
Environmental, cultural damages highlighted
In an interview with All Points West host Robyn Burns, Halalt First Nation's director of operations, Eli Enns, highlighted alleged environmental and cultural damage from the mill.
They also said the $2.1 billion sum they are seeking is justified when the totality of effects on the land and the health of Halalt First Nation are considered.
"They've been fairly dramatic over the 60 years of operation. We've seen a huge decline in biological diversity in the system and water quality," Enns said.
"Probably as importantly, the mill was constructed in and around and on sacred burial sites of the Coast Salish peoples of Halalt."
Enns also said the mill's location has damaged the Halalt First Nation economically by damaging sea resources in the area.
"I don't think you can put a dollar amount on the emotional damage to the community, but you can start to put a dollar amount on the cost of cleaning up the mess, the impact that it's had on the local community members' ability to meet their needs," they said.
Enns says their community acted in good faith in attempting to work with Catalyst to address their concerns, but the attempts did not work out.

(CNN) -- The road to America's economic recovery is like the proverbial long summer trip with no air conditioning. Despite miles traveled and progress made, the question on everyone's mind is the same: are we there yet?
Americans' frustration and impatience with the slow economic recovery is broad and deep, and understandably so. Jobs are being created at a pace slower than anyone would like.
On Wednesday former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a likely 2012 presidential contender, gave voice to this on the Boston Globe's editorial page.
Wrote the former governor, "Almost every action the president has taken has deepened and lengthened the [economic] downturn....His policies are anti-investment, anti-jobs and anti-growth."
To hear Romney tell it, President Obama and Congressional Democrats have done nothing but squander the last year and half. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.
The president and Democrats in Congress can point to many victories, including an $800 billion cash infusion and tax cuts to jump start the economy and prevent a second Great Depression; tough legislation that eradicates Wall Street's riskiest financial practices and enacts comprehensive consumer protections; and a historic health reform law that lowers cost, enhances choice and extends quality, affordable health care to 32 million uninsured Americans.
Despite these enormous legislative accomplishments, the electorate is unsettled. Faced with stubbornly high unemployment, they are annoyed with both their elected officials and with corporate America, whose profits are actually on the rebound but have yet to resume hiring at pre-recession levels.
Still, Romney's notion that the Obama administration is anti-jobs and anti-growth is both wrong and misleading.
Lest we forget, when President Bush left office, the nation was losing over 700,000 jobs per month, according to the President's Council of Economic Advisors, was engaged in two unfunded wars and was saddled with a $1.3 trillion budget deficit. While job losses have slowed since then, economic rejuvenation is moving slowly. Last month, private sector employment grew by 71,000 positions.
The long slog back has been, and still is, tough for many. But Obama seems to have embraced one central and important theme: the role of government in a capitalistic economy is to foster an environment conducive for job creation.
To that end, they have rightly refused calls from many on the liberal left to nationalize the banks during the height of the economic meltdown. Similarly, their thoughtful decision to provide short-term loans to the struggling automobile industry saved the country from even further economic uncertainty. In an April report entitled "A Look Back at GM, Chrysler and the American Auto Industry," the administration estimates that more than one million jobs were saved by the president's decision, which Romney and many other Republicans did not support.
Additionally, while many in the private sector were less than thrilled with the president's preference to have a government-backed health insurance option, they compromised in a way that enhanced patient choice and preserved the health industry's private delivery system. Their base was not pleased, but it was the right thing to do.
Equally impressive is the recent announcement, in a progress report on the president's National Export Initiative, that American exports grew more than 16 percent over the first four months of 2010, compared with the same period last year. At this rate, the president is well on their way to reach their goal of doubling our nation's exports over the next five years. This is especially important when 95 percent of the world's customers are beyond American borders.
Romney does at least make passing reference to the very worrisome issues of "looming deficits, national debt and unfunded entitlement liabilities," but they say nothing of the leadership President Obama displayed when appointing a bipartisan panel, the Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, to tackle these pressing problems.
Led by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, chief of staff in the Clinton White House, the 18-member panel will make tough recommendations to Congress on December 1.
Like most expected Republican presidential contenders, Romney also argues that Congress should preserve the Bush-era tax cuts, including for the wealthiest Americans (those individuals making more than $200,000 a year and households making more than $250,000 a year).
What Romney fails to mention is that extending Bush's tax cuts to these individuals and households would add $32 billion more to next year's deficit. The country can't afford to give massive tax cuts to the wealthy and make a noticeable dent in the deficit or debt.
Romney reminds me of the line from that old Loretta Lynn song, "Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die."
They want it all.
Unfortunately for Mr. Romney that's just not possible. America can't afford it.
To be clear, George Bush's economy is not improving as fast as we all would like, but thanks to the tough, smart choices of the Obama administration, progress is being made.
Mitt Romney should join the effort, and leave behind the over-the-top hyperbole that does nothing but distract and mislead. Whether they run for president or not, the country expects and deserves better.

Former Arizona Coyotes captain Shane Doan is retiring from the NHL after 21 seasons, they announced in a letter to fans Wednesday.
Doan, 40, has played only for the Coyotes, dating back to before the franchise moved from Winnipeg. They were the seventh overall pick by the Jets in 1995.
"I'm so grateful and thankful to the Winnipeg Jets for drafting me and giving me a chance to play my rookie season and when the team moved to the Valley in 1996, all I wanted to know was if the Coyotes would keep giving me a chance to play," Doan said in a first-person letter published in the Arizona Republic.
"I could not fathom at the time that I would end up playing in Arizona for the next 21 years, raise a family and call this place home. But that's exactly what happened. And that's why this has been one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make."

Doan, who served as the team's captain from 2003 to 2017, was not re-signed by the Coyotes after last season, as the team said it was time to move on and focus on younger players.
 They are the team's career leader in just about every significant category, including games played (1,540), shots (3,945), goals (402), assists (570), points (972), power-play goals (128) and game-winning goals (69). Their 1,540 games played is tied with John Bucyk for 14th on the NHL's all-time list.
"We would like to thank Shane for everything that he's done for our franchise over the past 21 years," the Coyotes said in a statement. "Shane had an incredible career on the ice and we are very proud of everything that they accomplished in a Coyotes uniform.
"He will be remembered as one of the greatest captains in NHL history. Off the ice, Shane was a great ambassador for growing the game of hockey in Arizona and their contributions to the community are immeasurable. Shane will be a Coyote for life. Thank you Captain!"
Doan was a two-time NHL All-Star selection and also was awarded the King Clancy Memorial Trophy, given to the NHL player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice, in 2010. They won five medals, including two golds, representing Canada at the world championships.
"I've been blessed and I'm so grateful for the fans and their support," Doan wrote. "They stuck by me throughout my career and the ups and downs of the Coyotes. There are a lot of players with more skill than me and a lot more ability than me that didn't ever get the type of appreciation that I got and the type of respect that the fans gave me, and I'm so grateful for that. I can't express how much I appreciate it. Thank you for watching me grow up, and I enjoyed watching a lot of you grow up, too."
Doan contemplated retirement after the 2014-15 season and ended up having a renaissance after they decided to play at least one more year, as they led the Coyotes with 28 goals while adding 19 assists.
Their 21st season was not as productive. Doan had a decreased role -- at least on the ice -- and had a few injuries that slowed him, causing their numbers to drop to six goals and 21 assists.
"Even though my perspective will be different, my love for the NHL won't change and I'll continue to share that passion with the hockey fans in Arizona," Doan wrote. "Thank you for loving the game with me. Thank you for the unwavering support. Thank you for fighting to keep the team here. Thank you for allowing this to be my home.
"And thank you for coming to spend a night with me playing hockey. It's been incredible."
DOJ Cracks Suspect's Hard Drives, Quickly Drops Request To Force Him To Decrypt
from the staying-far-away-from-a-precedent dept
We've been covering the DOJ's case against Jeffrey Feldman, in which they were trying to force them to decrypt some hard drives they had in order to get evidence to be used against him. This is a tricky area of law, because some courts have said that the 5th Amendment protects against being forced to decrypt evidence that can be used against you, while others have gone the other way . In this case, judges went back and forth , and the fight was still being fought.However, it appears the feds likely cracked Feldman's password for their hard drives, and wasted little time in asking the court to dismiss the application to compel Feldman to decrypt . Basically, they point out that they don't need it any more, because "the government has now successfully decrypted two of Feldman's hard drives," providing it with more than enough evidence to put them in jail for a long, long time. Of course, this undoubtedly makes the DOJ fairly happy, because the last thing it wants right now is a higher court precedent on the books saying that someone can't be compelled to decrypt such data. I'm sure another case will come along to take on this issue before too long, but for now, the government is able to just keep the decks clear of binding precedent.

ENDLESS THANKS to all of you for all of your support! We still have plenty of time left to spread the word about my campaign and to do some awesome things with my mom's sauce! Here are a couple to start:
MILESTONE # 1) From $26,000 to $35,000 I can finish art and label printing for individual cups (3 cups per pack) and the much requested and anticipated NO SUGAR ADDED version of Mom's Apple Sauce.
MILESTONE # 2) From $36,000 to $60,000 I can introduce individual cups into all 15 states and test the no sugar version in select markets.
*If I am fortunate enough to reach those goals I will be sending you the scoop on what can be accomplished with more pledges. Infinite thanks to all!
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP RIGHT NOW
Continue to educate others about my campaign. Share the link below via your social media pages, emails and blogs. If you live in a region that sells my sauce, the coolest thing you could possibly do is buy 2 jars, keep one for yourself and give one to a friend. We are working hard to get into as many states as possible so let's keep it all up, thanks again to all of you!

MY STORY
That Was Me at 25 Years Old
My name is Jim Mullen. On October 16th, 1996, my life changed in a major way. I was a Chicago police officer in the Rogers Park neighborhood and one night, I was shot in the cheek and spine while on duty. I was instantly paralyzed and dependent on a respirator to breath. In that moment my life changed forever. I was in the ICU at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for 2 months, and spent 4 months at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago before returning home and bound to a wheelchair. My new reality inspired a passion in me for proving to everyone that life is what you make out of it. Ever since that day, I've remembered that life is precious and dreams are worth chasing.

THE DREAM
My Mother, Audre
I was having a medical scan of my heart one day at Northwestern Hospital, what I refer to as one of my regular “tune-ups,” when the lady doing the scan told me about their barbecue sauce company. Growing up, my mother, Audre's, apple sauce was a hit with everyone. And because of her, I know what good, home cooked food tastes like. They were a self-taught chef, and we used to tease them about how their apple sauce was so good that they should bottle it. Even when I was just a kid, I used to joke around and say, “It's like apple pie without the crust!”
Later that evening when I came home after my medical scan, I decided I would follow my dream and start my own food company. After all, my mother made the best apple sauce in the world, and I wanted to share my mom's apple sauce with the world by getting it on the shelf of the grocery store, HAPPY FOODS, where they used to take me when I was little. All I have wanted to do is to make them happy, and this is my way of sharing a piece of them with others. When life gives you apples, make Apple Sauce.
My New Packaging
HISTORY OF MULLEN'S APPLE SAUCE
In 2007 I got a small batch of my mother's special blend of apples & spices made and begged to get their apple sauce on the shelf at Happy Foods, the store where my mom shopped with me when I was little. It took a little convincing but they finally put some on the shelves. My mom was happily surprised when I got to show them the sauce all bottled up. More good news followed when people started buying it, too. Throughout this process I was madly giving it away to family and friends as gifts. Turns out, everybody LOVED IT and was telling me to just go for it and make it an official business. Mullen Foods was born.
WHERE MULLEN FOODS CURRENTLY STANDS & PROJECT GOALS
"Operation: 14 STATES IN 6 MONTHS"
Thus far, I have made it into over 200 stores in the Chicago land area and have recently trickled into a few stores in a handful of other Midwestern States.
In just the last few months I connected with a new high volume manufacturer who has met my high expectations for the taste, texture and overall quality of Mullen's Apple Sauce, Chicago's Finest Apple Sauce. More recently I have also connected with a couple distributors that are presenting a real opportunity for me to grow distribution. I am launching this campaign to meet the upfront production costs that will produce enough product to open distribution into 14 additional states within 6 months as well as for sales support and marketing integration throughout the duration of this initiative.
The largest piece of the financial puzzle is the upfront cost of production from my manufacturer. I have to make it, ship it and pay for it before I can sell it. I need to be able to get Mullen Foods in a financial position to be able to cover much higher upfront expenses for 30 to 60 days before income from sales comes in.
I can't tell you how many manufacturers I had contacted over the last three years that attempted to do justice to this locally famous family recipe that, quite frankly, just couldn't get it right. Today I am fortunate to have found the right manufacturer and the right distributors to take Mullen's Apple Sauce to the next level within 6 months. I also have the art in place for the new, beautiful packaging (see above). Most of the critical pieces have fallen into place for me to make a giant leap, to take my mom's apple sauce to the next level. A significant piece that is holding me back is upfront manufacturing capital. That's why this campaign is crucial.
Next comes development and sales support out in the field. I am able to do a lot with my voice recognition software for the business from my home office but because of my severe disability, I am simply not able to make the long distance trips and do the leg work necessary to take the out-of-state meetings that will facilitate all of this. Essentially, I need someone who can be my arms and legs in the field to make the face to face connections with everyone from the grocery store teams to their loyal customers. I need someone to get out into new markets outside of my home territory and get people excited to try Mullen's Apple Sauce and go buy it from their neighborhood grocery store. Additionally, I am hoping to raise funds for marketing integration throughout the duration of this initiative.
Once this campaign has ended we will keep you informed as to how to be a bigger part of Chicago's Finest Apple Sauce tribe. Time is of the essence and I thank you for your consideration in advance.
My Wife Athena and My Daughter Maggie With Me.
SOME OF THE PLEDGE REWARDS AND WHY I CHOSE THEM FOR THIS INITIATIVE:

Nokia Networks (NYSE:NOK) is partnering with wireless startup Artemis Networks (a 2014 Fierce 15 winner) to jointly test Artemis' pCell technology with wireless carriers inside and outside of the United States in 2016. Artemis also plans on selling wholesale LTE data capacity.
The tests will initially be in large indoor venues and other high density areas, such a stadium, arenas, large indoor shopping malls, airports, college campuses and inside of buildings of large enterprises. Under the agreement, the companies will jointly offer pCell proof-of-concept deployments to selected Nokia Networks customers. The companies may extend the collaboration to consider further advanced features that could be enabled by pCells, such as precise 3D location positioning, the firms said.
In an interview with FierceWirelessTech, Steve Perlman, founder and CEO of Artemis, said that the company has been talking to numerous vendors about partnerships since the company burst onto the scene in February 2014, but talks with Nokia picked up this spring and summer. They said that at this point Artemis has done "due diligence" with around a dozen operators, including ones inside the U.S. and carriers from abroad, and that it has convinced skeptics that is technology is real.
Artemis described its pCell system as a software-defined radio Cloud-RAN that connects through fronthaul to pWave radios distributed throughout the coverage area. The pCell system exploits radio signal interference, rather than trying to reduce or eliminate it, to synthesize a 1-centimeter diameter "personal cell" around the antenna of any standard LTE device in the coverage area.
They said Nokia is making the deal public because "we're about to go in and start a trial with a partner" and that because Nokia is a leading TD-LTE vendor, pCell technology could be a "very good fit" for Nokia's carrier partners. Perlman said Artemis is open to working with other vendors but is excited to work with Nokia.
Nokia Networks CTO Hossein Moiin said in a separate interview with FierceWirelessTech that Nokia first became aware of Artemis' technology last year and that they personally demoed it in September, though Nokia engineers had been looking at pCell throughout 2015. Moiin said pCell has generated cause for optimism. "Any technology needs to solve a significant problem, and this one does," they said. "It solves the shortage of spectrum. It's a very attractive problem to solve. That alone is an importance, which I would like to make sure Nokia is aware of."
Perlman said that the first carrier Nokia and Artemis are working with wanted to start the trial Nov. 1 but that because of the time needed to set it up the trial will kick off in late 2015 or early 2016. They said more trials and announcements from Nokia customers are likely to come soon.
"The biggest pinch points for carriers are in high-density areas," they said. "It's the hardest part to solve for conventional cellular and the easiest thing to solve for us."
Moiin confirmed that the first trial will likely be concluded by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and is taking place outside of the United States. The trials, they said, are going to be used to test whether pCell really solves the problem of a shortage of spectrum for thousands of users, and whether it can be scaled up. "I'm optimistic that it will solve that problem but I don't know that solves that problem," they said. "Theoretically it's possible."
"The first trial will be designed to show whether the pCell technology can work with an existing core network and whether it can scale to many users," Moiin said. "Once we have answers to those two questions then can begin to think of trials as operators trialing the technology to see if it meets their requirements," they added. "That second phase will come after we have completed this first phase with Nokia and one operator. And that is something that will open the door to many operators."
Given that Nokia does not have unlimited resources, Moiin said, future trials will be determined based on interest from operators as well as potential business outcomes for Nokia. The vendor wants to explore the possibilities of using pCell for spectrum re-use, whether it will fit into 5G technology development or be something that simply optimizes LTE networks – and whether it can be added to Nokia's own products and solutions, Moiin said.
Artemis is leasing spectrum from Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH) in San Francisco Dish, through its wholly-owned subsidiary American H Block Wireless LLC, will lease the 1900 MHz PCS H Block spectrum it controls in San Francisco to Artemis for up to two years.
Perlman said that in the last few weeks Artemis got FCC approval to license the spectrum and deploy its technology on 58 rooftops in San Francisco. Artemis is working in San Francisco with a firm called Webpass, which controls around 600 rooftop locations in San Francisco. Artemis will install its radios on Webpass' rooftops.
Earlier this year Artemis intended to launch its own service in San Francisco once it received FCC approval to lease the spectrum. Artemis aimed to offer MVNO service via its own SIM cards with one of the Tier 1 U.S. carriers for when users are roaming outside of the Artemis service area in San Francisco.
However, that is no longer the case. Perlman said the company is getting inquiries from MVNOs and operators inside and outside the U.S. that roam on the networks of Tier 1 carriers that were looking for wholesale LTE capacity. Over the course of the spring and summer Artemis changed its focus. "Our cost of deployment is a fraction of a cellular system," Perlman explained of the benefit pCell technology can bring to other carriers.
"We would rather provide the technology and have a B2B relationship with MVNOs and roaming carriers," they said, adding that Artemis talked to MVNOs about selling phones that could use its technology. "To add B2C to our list of things as a startup is a huge whole swath of competency -- customer support, etc. -- that we'd rather not get into. We're focused on being a pure wholesale LTE operator."
Artemis does not have any announced agreements with carriers seeking wholesale capacity, Perlman said. They added that company aims to go through its trials with Nokia and get more Tier 1 carrier announcements.
"It's nice to be on the other side of the fence," they said, adding that the Nokia deal brings a great deal of credibility to Artemis. "Rather than being this cold fusion company saying, 'This is real, look at us, look at us.'"
Moiin added that "this is very exciting." They recalled that "many years ago when I went to engineering school I wanted to solve problems like this: problems that can't be solved."

Over the next few years, more than a million service men and women will end their military careers and transition back to civilian life. Many of these veterans will decide to go back to school to finish their degrees, enroll in a community college for the first time, or work to obtain a master's degree.
That's why, on our campus communities, we need to make sure that our veterans have access to the programs that will help them succeed and obtain good jobs to support their families.
This April, as we mark the second anniversary of Joining Forces, I am pleased to be visiting several higher education institutions to learn more about what they are doing to support student veterans.
Dr. Biden participates on a panel with student, faculty and staff veterans at George Washington University (by Jessica McConnell Burt / The George Washington University)
On Wednesday, I visited George Washington University to meet with student veterans and hear about several of their initiatives. While I was there, I heard from members of GW Vets, their student group representing more than 1,500 student veterans, military dependent students and allies across campus.
One of those students was Nichole Krom, a first-year student who became involved in GW Vets as soon as they heard about it and is now the organization's secretary. Nichole is not a veteran herself, but their father recently retired from the New York Air National Guard.  They are a wonderful example of an important truth about our service men and women who sacrifice so much for our country – their families serve right alongside them.
Throughout the panel discussion, I heard how the campus is actively engaged in finding ways to make the student veteran transition into the civilian sector seamless.
Elena Kim, a U.S Army veteran and senior at GWU, described a program called The Rendering Project, which is a partnership between GWU and local schools. Through the program, high school students are creating works of art based on testimonials written by GW student-veterans, military personnel and families. The idea behind the program is simple – all of our service men and women have a unique story to tell – and the connection with the civilian population strengthens understanding of the sacrifices and experiences of our service members.
I also heard about The Ribbon Project, a new initiative being launched that will help train faculty and staff – by student veterans – on how to better integrate the veteran experience into the classroom and campus life.
As a teacher for more than 30 years, I always say that what I see in my classroom is inspiring. Many of my students are veterans who are hoping additional education will help move them ahead in their careers.
So as we continue to look toward the best practices that will support our student veterans over the coming years, I was pleased to learn more about the creative ideas and programs being implemented at GWU.
Nichole put it best when they described their experience with GW Vets: “We are more than just a student organization – we are family.”
U.S. Parries N. Korean Threats With A Fresh Plan
Enlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/AP
You might think alarm bells would be sounding in Washington, given the warnings coming out of North Korea. But when they talk about North Korea, U.S. officials are sounding like exasperated parents responding to a child's tantrum.
At the White House on Friday, spokesperson Jay Carney said the United States "would not be surprised" if North Korea actually carries out a missile test.
"We have seen them launch missiles in the past, and the U.N. Security Council has repeatedly condemned them as violations of the North's obligations under numerous Security Council resolutions, and it would fit their current pattern of bellicose, unhelpful and unconstructive rhetoric and actions," Carney said.
If the North Koreans do launch a missile, the U.S. would have to decide whether to shoot it down. On the eve of a launch in 2006, then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said U.S. forces would do so only if the missile were headed toward U.S. territory.
After the North Koreans shelled a South Korean military base in 2010, however, U.S. and South Korean leaders resolved to respond more aggressively to such incidents. They drew up what they called a counterprovocation plan, and this year they knew the plan might be put to a test.
One Plan, Three Messages
The U.S. and South Korea stage joint military exercises every year around this time, and North Korea always gets upset. This year, there's a new leader in the North, determined to make an impression. So the U.S. and South Korea decided it was important to "signal" their readiness to respond to hostile action and the exercises included an especially dramatic show of force with stealth bombers.
The reaction from the North has been especially aggressive.
Gen. Walter Sharp, who until last year was the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, says the whole sequence of events shows how challenging it is to deal with all the demands, contingencies and the risks on the Korean Peninsula.
"That's why there's been a lot of effort over the past two and a half years now to build this counterprovocation plan," Sharp says. "Because that's a hard balance of a strong response — don't escalate, but be prepared to go to war."
U.S. officials say the counterprovocation plan and the U.S. show of force send three separate messages: The South Koreans see that the U.S. military is standing behind them; the North Koreans find out what they'd face were they to start something; and China sees how high the stakes are and why it may need to rein North Korea in.
A Plan For Escalation, A Preference For Calm
If the North Koreans launched even a limited artillery strike against the South — like what they did in 2010 — Gen. Sharp says South Korean troops would fire back instantly.
If North Korea were then to escalate, Presidents Obama in Washington and Park Geun-hye in the Republic of Korea would decide how to respond.
"There are options that people have worked and thought through that could very quickly be brought to President Park and President Obama," Sharp says.
That's the escalation scenario, and it leads to all-out war.
So now that the show of force and resolve signals have been sent, it's time for another message: that war should be avoided.
"We have no specific information to suggest an imminent threat to U.S. citizens or facilities in the [Republic of Korea]," State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said this week, reassuring Americans by relaying a statement from the U.S. Embassy in South Korea.
"The goal there was to be calming, obviously," they said. That message, to calm down, coming at what seems like an especially dangerous moment, was likely meant to be heard on all sides.
Review sites like TR are a tricky business, let me say up front. We work constantly with the largest makers of PC hardware in order to bring you timely reviews of the latest products. Making that happen, and keeping our evaluations fair and thorough, isn't easy in the context of large companies engaging in cutthroat competition over increasingly complex technologies.
I know for a fact that many folks who happen across TR's reviews are deeply skeptical about the whole enterprise, and given everything that goes on in the shadier corners of the web, they have a right to be. That said, we have worked very hard over the years to maintain our independence and to keep our readers' interests first among our priorities, and I think our regular audience will attest to that fact.
At its heart, the basic arrangement that we have with the largest PC chip companies is simple. In exchange for early access to product samples and information, we agree to one constraint: timing. That is, we agree not to post the product information or our test results until the product's official release.
That's it, really.
There are a few other nuances, such as the fact that we're released from that obligation if the information becomes public otherwise, but they only serve to limit the extent of the agreement.
In other words, we don't consent to any other constraint that would compromise our editorial independence. We don't guarantee a positive review; we don't agree to mention certain product features; and we certainly don't offer any power over the words we write or the results we choose to publish. In fact, by policy, these companies only get to see our reviews of their products when you do, not before.
If you're familiar with us, we may be covering well-trodden ground here, but bear with me. Our status as an independent entity is key to what we do. Most of the PR types we work with tend to understand that fact, so we usually get along pretty well. There's ample room for dialog and persuasion about the merits of a particular product, but ultimately, we offer our own opinions. In fact, the basic arrangement we have with these firms has been the same for most of the 13 years of our existence, even during the darkest days of Intel's Pentium 4 fiasco.
You can imagine my shock, then, upon receiving an e-mail message last week that attempted to re-write those rules in a way that grants a measure of editorial control to a company whose product we're reviewing. What AMD is doing, in quasi-clever fashion, is attempting to shape the content of reviews by dictating a two-stage plan for the release of information. In doing so, they grant themselves a measure of editorial control over any publication that agrees to the plan.
In this case, the product in question is the desktop version of AMD's Trinity APUs. We received review samples of these products last week, with a product launch date set for early October. However, late last week, the following e-mail from Peter Amos, who works in AMD's New Product Review Program, hit our inbox:
We are allowing limited previews of the embargoed information to generate additional traffic for your site, and give you an opportunity to put additional emphasis on topics of interest to your readers. If you wish to post a preview article as a teaser for your main review, you may do so on September 27th, 2012 at 12:01AM EDT. The topics which you are free to discuss in your preview articles starting September 27th, 2012 at 12:01AM EDT are any combination of: - Gaming benchmarks (A10, A8) - Speeds, feeds, cores, SIMDs and branding - Experiential testing of applications vs Intel (A10 Virgo will be priced in the range of the i3 2120 or i3 3220) - Power testing We believe there are an infinite number of interesting angles available for these preview articles within this framework. We are also aware that your readers expect performance numbers in your articles. In order to allow you to have something for the preview, while maintaining enough content for your review, we are allowing the inclusion of gaming benchmarks. By allowing the publication of speeds, feeds, cores, SIMDs and branding during the preview period, you have the opportunity to discuss the innovations that AMD is making with AMD A-Series APUs and how these are relevant to today's compute environment and workloads. In previewing x86 applications, without providing hard numbers until October [redacted], we are hoping that you will be able to convey what is most important to the end-user which is what the experience of using the system is like. As one of the foremost evaluators of technology, you are in a unique position to draw educated comparisons and conclusions based on real-world experience with the platform.
The idea here is for AMD to allow a "preview" of the product that contains a vast swath of the total information that one might expect to see in a full review, with a few notable exceptions. Although "experiential testing" is allowed, sites may not publish the results of non-gaming CPU benchmarks.
The email goes on to highlight a few other features of the Socket FM2 platform before explaining what information may be published in early October:
The topics which you must be held for the October [redacted] embargo lift are: - Overclocking - Pricing - Non game benchmarks
The email then highlights each of these topic areas briefly. Here's what it says about the temporarily verboten non-gaming benchmarks:
Non game benchmarks
- Traditional benchmarks are designed to highlight differences in different architectures and how they perform. We understand that this is a useful tool for you and that your readers expect to see this data. The importance of these results is in your evaluation, as the leading experts, of what these performance numbers mean. We encourage you to use your analysis if you choose to publish a preview article and if you find that to be appropriate to your approach to that article. The numbers themselves must be held until the October [redacted] embargo lift. This is in an effort to allow consumers to fully comprehend your analysis without prejudging based on graphs which do not necessarily represent the experiential difference and to help ensure you have sufficient content for the creation of a launch day article.
Now, we appreciate that AMD is introducing this product in an incredibly difficult competitive environment. We're even sympathetic to the idea that the mix of resources included in its new APU may be more optimal for some usage patterns, as our largely positive review of the mobile version of Trinity will attest. We understand why they might wish to see "experiential testing" results and IGP-focused gaming benchmarks in the initial review that grabs the headlines, while burying the CPU-focused benchmarks on a later date. By doing so, they'd be leading with the product's strengths and playing down its biggest weakness.
And it's likely to work, I can tell you from long experience, since the first article about a subject tends to capture the buzz and draw the largest audience. A second article a week later? No so much. Heck, even if we hold back and publish our full review later (which indeed is our plan), it's not likely to attract as broad a readership as it would have on day one, given the presence of extensive "previews" elsewhere.
Yes, AMD and other firms have done limited "preview" releases in the past, where select publications are allowed to publish a few pictures and perhaps a handful of benchmark numbers ahead of time. There is some slight precedent there.
But none of that changes the fact that this plan is absolutely, bat-guano crazy. It crosses a line that should not be crossed.
Companies like AMD don't get to decide what gets highlighted in reviews and what doesn't. Using the review press's general willingness to agree on one thing—timing—to get additional control may seem clever, but we've thought it over, and no. We'll keep our independence, thanks.
The email goes on to conclude by, apparently, anticipating such a reaction and offering a chance for feedback:
We are aware that this is a unique approach to product launches. We are always looking at ways that we can work with you to help drive additional traffic to your articles and effectively convey the AMD message. We strive to provide the best products in their price points, bringing a great product for a great price. Please feel free to provide feedback on what you find, both with the product and with your experience in the AMD New Product Review Program. We try to ensure that we are providing you what you need and appreciate any feedback you have to offer on how we can do better.
I picked up the phone almost immediately after reading this paragraph and attempted to persuade both Mr. Amos and, later, their boss that this plan was not a good one. I was told that this decision was made not just in PR but at higher levels in the company and that my objections had been widely noted in internal emails. Unfortunately, although fully aware of my objections and of the very important basic principle at stake, AMD decided to go through with its plan.
Shame on them for that.
It's possible you may see desktop Trinity "previews" at other websites today that conform precisely to AMD's dictates. I'm not sure. I hope most folks have decided to refrain from participation in this farce, but I really don't know what will happen. I also hope that any who did participate will reconsider their positions after reading this post and thinking about what they're giving up.
And I hope, most of all, that the broader public understands what's at stake here and insists on a change in policy from AMD.
If this level of control from companies over the content of reviews becomes the norm, we will be forced to change the way we work the firms whose products we review. We will not compromise our independence. We believe you demand and deserve nothing less.
Update: AMD has issued a statement on this matter.
After two months of military operations against or related to the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), the Pentagon still doesn't know what, exactly, to call the mission.
Top military brass is still trying to find a fitting name for the operation as classified Pentagon PowerPoint slides tentatively call “Operations in Iraq and Syria,” the Wall Street Journal reports.
Officials rejected the latest name nomination, “Operation Inherent Resolve.”
“It is just kind of bleh,” said one officer.
The ISIS mission name search is in keeping with an operation nicknaming tradition extending back in the U.S. to World War II. The 1989 invasion of Panama added another layer to the military mission naming question after officials realized the propaganda value of a name; that mission was called “Operation Blue Spoon” until it was renamed “Operation Just Cause.”

Investing.com - Bitcoin edged lower in rangebound trade on Wednesday, as speculators awaited the next catalyst to influence price direction.
Bitcoin (BTC-eUSD) held in a range between $627.12 and $654.13 on Slovenia-based BitStamp. Prices last traded at $630.93 during U.S. morning hours, down 2.03%, or $13.07.
The price of a Bitcoin on Bulgaria-based BTC-e retreated 1.51%, or $9.67, to trade at $632.63.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency declined 2.34% to trade at $634.58.
Bitcoin prices rallied towards the end of May as growing optimism over the outlook for the digital currency boosted prices. Bitcoin rose nearly 29% last month.
However, prices have since been trapped in rangebound trade as investors remained on the sidelines amid a lack of fresh trading cues.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.
The US embargo on Cuba may not exist much longer. But now we know how Cuba's socialist government dodged it, using offshore banks and shell companies to do business in US dollars and protect foreign partners from American retribution.
The network of secret companies was discovered in the Panama Papers, a collection of documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca in Panama that was leaked to a consortium of international journalists. The papers showed how everyone from the former Prime Minister of Iceland to US heiresses leveraged corporate secrecy to keep their money untaxed and hidden from law enforcement.
And Cuba was in on the act. The Miami Herald found how one Lebanese oil trading firm, BB Energy, used a shell company to supply Cuba with oil from 1992 to 2001, the years when the island nation lost a key economic backer in the Soviet Union, but before Venezuela became a major source of oil.
The scheme allowed BB Energy to continue doing business with the US financial system while trading $300 million of oil for sugar with Cuba. The deal moved through an undisclosed company set up in Panama and directed by Jürgen Mossack, a founder of the law firm. While BB Energy denies that the companies are related, the Panama Papers documents show that they share directors and financial obligations.
In all, 25 shell companies at Mossack Fonseca were found to have links to Cuba. Many were directed by high-ranking Cuban officials and apparently used to trade in food, medicine and cigars, key industries run by the state. Others were used to hide foreign assets of the Cuban state that may have been threatened by seizure.
While the US embargo on Cuba has proven an ineffective sanctions regime largely because the rest of the world has not played along, these revelations demonstrate that the offshore finance system—often protected by US law—provides a surprisingly straightforward way around financial sanctions.
More worrying than economically desperate Cuba smuggling oil past sanctions is the idea of a country like North Korea using shell companies to smuggle nuclear technology or weapons past the international community. And we have some sense that they are trying—this news brings to mind the 2013 incident in the Panama Canal, when two MIG-21 fighters and missile parts were seized in a freighter, underneath a load of Cuban sugar, bound for Pyongyang.
GINIA BELLAFANTE/THE NEW YORK TIMES
Mesmo com tantas crises perturbando o mundo recentemente, a notícia de que um projeto imobiliário no Upper West Side em Manhattan levará adiante um modelo de engenharia social muito desagradável conseguiu chamar atenção internacional. O edifício, chamado Riverside South, que abrange um terreno que chega até a Rua 72 e parece amplamente um local que surgiu repentinamente para pessoas que nunca ouviram falar do Katz's Delicatessen ou da linha G do Metrô, teve aprovação da prefeitura da cidade para ter duas entradas separadas – uma para os moradores ricos e outra para aqueles que ganham bem menos e que ocuparão as unidades mais baratas do projeto, numa ala separada.
O efeito “os de cima e os de baixo” foi possível com base numa mudança da lei de zoneamento durante a administração Michael Bloomberg que deu às incorporadoras com projetos residenciais a preço de mercado o poder de decidir quanto a esses detalhes, além de isenções fiscais consideráveis.
Embora a configuração do edifício seja um anátema em relação aos valores adotados pelo prefeito atual, Bill de Blasio, obrigar a incorporadora a abandonar o projeto envolveria um processo caro e não inteiramente sustentável juridicamente, disse a prefeitura. O foco agora é reverter aquela mudança da lei, disse a vice-prefeita, Alicia Glen, o que deve levar cerca de um ano.
A “porta para os pobres”, como é chamada, é uma odiosa resposta a um problema cuja solução não é nem óbvia nem facilmente encontrada por meio de mecanismos políticos: como e até que ponto deve a cidade ordenar uma integração econômica? O projeto Riverside South é inusitado, e até um pouco radical, no sentido de que suas unidades luxuosas são condomínios, e não apartamentos de aluguel.
Basicamente, edifícios como este, que combinam apartamentos mais acessíveis a preço de mercado, não colocam nenhum apartamento à venda.
Neste caso, um edifício em que os apartamentos são negociados em torno de US$ 22.000 o metro quadrado, também conterá 55 apartamentos para famílias com renda em torno de US$ 35.280 a US$ 50.340 ao ano.
Quase que todo o Upper East Side, da Avenida Lexington até a 5ª Avenida, é testemunha disto: pessoas ricas gostam de viver entre pessoas ricas. Uma incorporadora construindo uma estrutura com apartamentos a US$ 3 milhões vai se preocupar, não sem razão, que tais apartamentos serão menos comercializáveis se estiverem ao lado daqueles que estão sendo alugados a US$ 1.000 por mês.
Não se trata apenas que as pessoas ricas consideram as pessoas mais pobres asquerosas, embora em alguns caso isso possa ser verdade, mas o fato é que os proprietários normalmente preferem viver junto com outros proprietários, acreditando que isto protege melhor o valor do seu ativo. A locação tem a pecha da transitoriedade, menor estabilidade, etc. (Embora somente um terço dos nova-iorquinos seja proprietário de um imóvel, cerca de 60% que ganham mais de US$ 500.000 estão nessa situação, de acordo com o Furman Center da Universidade de Nova York).
Então, como associar as coisas quando isto parece tão contrário às preferências e justificativas básicas de uma classe social inteira? Alguns alegam que a integração deve se subordinar a um objetivo maior de construir um imóvel residencial ao preço mais barato possível, o que seria mais fácil de realizar em partes da cidade onde o terreno é mais distante do centro da riqueza e poder e portanto mais barato. Apesar de este enfoque ser mais economicamente eficaz, e até tem seu mérito do ponto de vista ético, é difícil considerá-lo mais objetivo do ponto de vista social.
Num universo ideal, líderes progressistas possuiriam habilidades de marketing tão profundas que poderiam alterar e reformular nossa definição de status, de maneira a haver uma mistura estreita e agressiva de populações diferentes que tem sua própria distinção e valor apreciável. A chamada gentrificação (processo de recuperação do valor imobiliário e de revitalização de região central da cidade após período de degradação, o enobrecimento de locais anteriormente populares) quando não resulta num deslocamento total, realiza isto até certo ponto. Os bairros de Chelsea, em Manhattan, e Boerum Hill, no Brooklin, viram aumentos enormes nos preços dos imóveis nos últimos anos, embora as duas áreas abriguem enormes conjuntos habitacionais bancados pelo poder público. Apartamentos e casas de tijolinhos multimilionários dão vista direta para prédios onde moram famílias muito pobres.
Talvez seja mais sensato concentrar os esforços de construção de imóveis a preços acessíveis em áreas onde pelo menos haja um interesse orgânico na diversidade econômica, mais do que forçar isto em locais menos receptivos. No final, a construção do Riverside Boulevard vai gerar muita controvérsia e debate político, e tudo em benefício de menos do que cinco dezenas de famílias numa cidade onde mais de 50.000 pessoas estão desabrigadas.
The Danish Transport and Construction Agency said on Wednesday that a passenger plane nearly collided with an illegal drone during its approach into Copenhagen Airport last Friday, narrowly avoiding “fatal consequences”.
According to the agency, the drone was flying 450 metres above ground, well above the 100-metre allowed height for drones. The agency said that the pilot of the passenger plane, which was not identified in detail, described the drone's position as “very close” to the passenger aircraft.

“We strongly condemn these types of illegal flights with drones. It is a sign of stupidity and it puts passengers' lives at risk when a drone is flown in the vicinity of a plane,” agency spokesperson Jesper Rasmussen said.
“Drones are becoming more and more widespread and it is important that people who fly drones make sure they understand the applicable rules,” they added.
Danish legislation states that drones can not fly higher than 100 metres and they must stay at least eight kilometres away from military bases and at least five kilometres from public airfields. Drones are also barred from densely populated areas or near public roads.
Speaking with Berlingske newspaper, Rasmussen conceded that as drones gain in popularity it will be hard to enforce the rules.
“It's not possible to stop all illegal activity, and the same applies to drones. I can't imagine how one can stop people from flying them near airports. We can only hope that in this case it was a person who mistakenly flew too close to the airport,” they said.
The Danish Transport and Construction Agency is working with other public institutions, including the Defence and Justice Ministries, to create a new set of rules for drones. Among the suggestions is to outfit all unmanned aircraft with a ‘licence plate' to make it easier to identify the owner.
This past Saturday, a reddit user named Naratto used the Confession Bear—a meme with which reddit users admit often-true secrets like being obsessed with a brother, loving Justin Bieber, enjoying the smell of one's own balls—to talk about a murder. "My sister had an abusive meth addict boyfriend," Naratto claimed. "I killed them with their own drugs while they were unconscious and they ruled it as an overdose."
Surely, Naratto was joking, right? Right? It's a Breaking Bad synopsis posted on a photo of bear. But Naratto's fellow redditors weren't so dismissive, immediately excavating Naratto's personal information and posting their biographical data on the site. This information dump was reliable enough to freak out Naratto, who confirmed its accuracy in an aggrieved follow-up post, by writing, "I made a meme about something and it was turned into people revealing my PERSONAL INFORMATION. It was quite rude and VERY uncalled for." Soon after, Naratto deleted their profile and disappeared entirely.
This is the same community that's ardently defended the right to online anonymity and privacy, even as a protection for despicable privacy-violating behavior. Yet users allowed this personal information to be preserved even after reddit moderators deleted it, leaving this list of what we know about Naratto, the user who joked (yes, joked, right?) about murder with a bear:
He's a 24-year-old male with ties to San Diego, California.
Their middle name is Ryder
Their birthdate is 2/11/89.
They have an older sister who is approximately 29 years old.
He's a former US Navy Fire Controlman 2nd Class.
In 2008 they worked construction on a house on top of a hill at 4985 Mt. Helix Dr. in El Cajon, CA, driving a hydraulic skid-steer.
Used to own a snake named Kitty.
Claims to be bipolar.
Favorite Movie: Rampage (Probably the 2009 film).
Favorite Song: "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida."
Their favorite sandwich at Mama's Grill in Clairemont, San Diego is called the Outlaw.
Using all this information—again, provided by reddit's own membership—it's possible to show that Naratto's background matches that of a 24-year-old named Colton Goodbrand.
Here's how the two connect.
A Twitter account with the handle @Narratto belongs to a Colton R. Goodbrand from San Diego, California. The bio: "Neo-Hippie. Smoking pot for the greater good!" (@Narratto is spelled with one more additional "r" than the reddit account, perhaps because the alternate was already taken.)
Although it was apparently hacked in July 2011, producing a lingering trail of Spam links, this Twitter account dates back to November 2010. So it wasn't just created to associate the name Colton Goodbrand and a photo with the currently contentious handle. More than likely, the owner either can't access it or forgot about it, which is perhaps why @Narratto isn't deleted entirely or altered.
Public records confirm a Colton Goodbrand with a February 1989 birthdate held an address in San Diego, California.
Colton "Colt" Goodbrand has a lingering MySpace profile that lists their birthday as Feb 11th, 1989, their hometown as the Pacific Beach, and their occupation as Firing Control for the US Navy. There are also photos of someone described as Colton's sister.
There are also photos of someone described as Colton's sister. Like Twitter's Colton R. Goodbrand, MySpace Colt alludes to recreational drugs ("In the past month have you been on Drugs: FUCK NO drugs are for looooosers lol," "Number of Drugs I have taken: Not gonna go into that...") and Canada. Photos look like the same person.
There's also an extant Naratto on Help.com from 2010.
This Naratto profile matches biographical data for both reddit's Naratto and Colton Goodbrand, including San Diego, CA, a job in the US Navy FC3, and the hobby of smoking pot. Like MySpace Colton, they say they went to college briefly and mentions Canada. They too are prone to working out emotional conflicts online, here asking for advice about a messy work disagreement with their mother, who they wrote ran a medical-marijuana dispensary collective in San Diego.
Colton Goodbrand's mother Michelle ran a California medical marijuana dispensary from 2010 until 2012.
This is according to Goodbrand's own LinkedIn profile, which cites them as the president of the since-shuttered company, California Healing. Public records confirm that Colton is related to this Michelle. On MySpace, a less professional-looking Michelle is friends with Myspace 2009 Colton.
Help.com Naratto says that their favorite sport is Shito-Ryu Karate-Do. On YouTube, there's a December 2012 video of Colton Goodbrand demonstrating karate. The onscreen text identifies them as "Colton Ryder," reddit Naratto's middle name.
Both MySpace Colton and Help.com's Naratto grumble online about their car problems. Colton Goodbrand's Facebook has been recently deleted. Various other references match.
In the Gawker's comments section, Gizmodo emeritus editor Joel Johnson posted a message from someone they believe is Naratto's sister, who wrote: "My brother lives in another country, not sure what they do online. It's an ill-advised prank. I know no one who has overdosed and my brother is a scrawny gamer." Canada qualifies as another country. There's a Naratto on World of Warcraft. And Naratto's still-archived reddit comments include Nintendo and GameCube references. (Colton's sister didn't respond to our email or Facebook messages, though their YouTube channel is what's hosting the karate video.)
So why again do we care? Oh right, Naratto purportedly confessed to a murder. While this could all be a very badly misconstrued joke, Naratto never entirely backed away from their Confession Bear scenario. "There is SOME truth behind it, but I'm not saying what was true and what wasn't," they posted in a follow-up. They were peeved that their fellow redditors had aggregated their personal information, but they seemed far more upset about having their identity tied to whatever truth was behind the statement, typing, "Sure you can find information about ME, but linking me to something that happened is completely different."
It's unclear if that nebulous "something that happened" was, well, anything. Colton didn't return an email sent to an old address. Reached by phone late yesterday, Michelle Goodbrand said "Good luck with that" when asked about a familial overdose, and hung up. They did not return a follow-up message.
Thanks, reddit.

One of India's top women bikers, Veenu Paliwal , died in a road accident in Vidisha district in Madhya Pradesh late on Monday evening.
Paliwal, 44, was on a nationwide tour on their Harley-Davidson when the accident took place. They were accompanied on another bike by fellow biker Dipesh Tanwar.

Paliwal died after their bike went out of control on a turn and they skid off a road near Gyaraspur about 100km from Bhopal. They were rushed to a primary health centre and later to the Vidisha district hospital, where they were declared brought dead.
Paliwal and Tanwar were heading to Bhopal from Sagar when the accident took place.
Paliwal, a Jaipur resident, was known for their skills with the motorcycle and for having driven the Harley-Davidson bikes at 180kmph. They were planning to make a documentary on their nationwide bike journey.

The police said that their family and friends had been informed and that they would be reaching Jaipur soon. The post-mortem on Paliwal's body was to take place today morning.
Veenu Paliwal had recently been named the Lady of the Harley 2016.

Even 12 months ago, an Intel Nehalem-powered gaming PC with 6 GB of system memory was considered high-end. Now there's already talk of a graphics card taking shape, that has that much memory. On Thursday this week, AMD launched its Radeon HD 7970 graphics card, which features its newest 28 nm "Tahiti" GPU, and 3 GB of GDDR5 memory across a 384-bit wide memory interface. All along, it had plans of making a dual-GPU graphics card that made use of two of these GPUs to give you a Crossfire-on-a-stick solution. AMD codenamed this product "New Zealand". We are now getting to learn that codename "New Zealand" will carry the intuitive-sounding market name Radeon HD 7990, and that it is headed for a Q1 2012 launch.This means that Radeon HD 7990 should arrive before April 2012. Tests show that Tahiti has superior energy-efficiency compared to previous-generation "Cayman" GPU, even as it has increased performance. From a technical standpoint, a graphics card featuring two of these Tahiti GPUs, running with specifications matching those of the single-GPU HD 7970, looks workable. Hence, there is talk of 6 GB of total graphics memory (3 GB per GPU system).One can also expect the fruition of AMD's new ZeroCore technology. This technology powers down the GPU to zero draw when the monitor is blanked (idling), but in CrossFire setups, this technology completely powers down other GPUs than the primary one to zero state, when the system is not running graphics-heavy applications. This means that the idle, desktop, and Blu-ray playback power-draw of the HD 7990 will be nearly equal to that of the HD 7970, which is already impressive.
President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators about former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a person familiar with the investigation confirmed Wednesday to The Associated Press.
The person said the questioning of Kushner earlier this month took about 90 minutes or less and was aimed in part at establishing whether Kushner had any information on Flynn that might be exculpatory. The person said multiple White House witnesses have been asked about their knowledge of Flynn, who was forced to resign from the White House in February after officials concluded they had misled them about their contacts with the Russian ambassador.
The confirmation of Kushner's interview came as prosecutors working for Mueller postponed grand jury testimony related to Flynn's private business dealings.
The reason for the postponement was not immediately clear, but it comes one week after attorneys for Flynn alerted Trump's legal team that they could no longer share information about the case. That discussion between lawyers was widely seen as a possible indication that Flynn was moving to cooperate with Mueller's investigation or attempting to negotiate a deal for himself.
An attorney for Flynn, Robert Kelner, did not immediately respond to email and phone messages Wednesday afternoon. Peter Carr, a spokesperson for Mueller, declined comment.
In a statement, Kushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said, "Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so."
The details of Kushner's questioning and the postponement of the grand jury testimony were confirmed by people familiar with Mueller's investigation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing investigation.
The grand testimony that had been scheduled for the coming days related to Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, its work with a public relations firm and interactions with congressional staff, one of the people said.
Mueller and the FBI have been interested in hearing from employees at the public relations firm, SGR, because of the firm's work with Flynn Intel Group. SGR, which does business as Sphere Consulting, did public relations work on a film Flynn Intel Group was working on about Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. The film was never completed.
Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department in May to oversee an investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The investigation, which produced its first criminal charges last month against three former Trump campaign officials, incorporated an earlier FBI inquiry into Flynn's lobbying and investigative research work on behalf of a Turkish business person. Flynn's firm was paid $530,000 for the work.
Sphere employees have cooperated for months with Mueller's investigation, including by turning over documents requested by investigators and sitting for voluntary interviews.
An October 2016 meeting that was expected to be the subject of the grand jury testimony has been described as a bait-and-switch carried out on behalf of Flynn's firm.
As the AP reported in March , Flynn's business partner, Bijan Kian, invited a representative of the House Homeland Security committee to Flynn Intel's offices in Alexandria, Virginia, to discuss secure communications products. But after discussing the products, the session quickly turned into a lobbying pitch that mirrored Turkish government talking points.
Kian and others involved were particularly interested in pushing for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen, whom the Turkish government has blamed for a botched coup and who has been living in exile in Pennsylvania. Gulen has denied any involvement.
Flynn Intel Group's requests for congressional hearings went nowhere.
Flynn disclosed some of the details of the meeting in a filing with the Justice Department earlier this year. According to that filing, an employee of Sphere consulting was present during the meeting.
CNN first reported the postponement.
In many ways 2003 could be considered as the pivotal year for the Korean film industry. With the advent of the DVD format, Korean movies had already begun filtering through to the western market, with titles such as Shiri, Nowhere to Hide, and Tell Me Something becoming a familiar sight on high street shelves. However in 2003 it seemed the country could do no wrong when it came to movies – Park Chan-wook made the seminal OldBoy, Bong Joon-ho directed the classic Memories of Murder, Kim Jee-woon adapted the horror A Tale of Two Sisters, and a director by the name of Kim Sung-ho made their debut with Into the Mirror.
As the first decade of the millennium progressed on, Hollywood developed an unhealthy obsession with re-making practically any Asian horror movie they could get their hands on, and Into the Mirror was no exception. In 2008 the re-make hit cinema screens under the title Mirrors, directed by Alexandre Aja and starring Kiefer Sutherland, and even spawned a sequel.
Sung-ho themselves could be said to have taken an unexpected career path, which saw them move away from full length features to focus on directing a number of short films, which could usually be found released as a part of omnibus movies. From most recently directing a segment in Horror Stories 2, to helming a segment in 2012's Fighting! Family, a movie commissioned by the Korean government with the sole purpose of encouraging the population to reproduce, due to the countries low birth rate. Yes you read that right.
This year Sung-ho releases their third full length movie, which as with their previous two they also wrote, in the form of How to Steal a Dog. Far from being a remake of Bong Joon-ho's debut Barking Dogs Never Bite, it's a family friendly tale adapted from a novel by US writer Barbara O'Connor. The movie was selected to be screened on the opening night of the Korean Film Festival of Australia 2015, and Sung-ho flew in to attend the screening. Before being whisked into the depths of Sydney's main cinema, the director was graceful enough to give me 30 minutes to have a one on one discussion on their time working in the film industry.
With a laid back style and moppish hair, Sung-ho has a softly spoken manner which was easy to listen to, and was genuinely surprised that a non-Korean would know so much about their movies. Armed with a black coffee, we took a seat in a café on the main road in Sydney city, and got down to business.
Paul Bramhall: Director Kim, welcome to Sydney, and thank you for taking the time out to do an interview!
Kim Sung-ho: Thank you, it's a beautiful city!
PB: Now your new movie, How to Steal a Dog, is based on a novel by the American writer Barbara O'Connor. It's quite unusual to see a Korean movie adapted from a US novel, so what was it that appealed to you about the story?
KSH: In South Korea children's movies are very rare, especially in the last 10 years, so in the beginning I thought that I should make a children's movie. But as time passed my thought developed to a point that I wanted to make a family movie, rather than one which is just targeted at kids. So I felt determined that I should direct this film, because in Korea now there are a lot of films that use really dramatic and heavy scenes to promote themselves, but this movie doesn't have those types of scenes, it's a very heartwarming piece. I feel that in South Korea these types of movie rarely get invested in, and are not produced very often, so I felt a duty that I have to make this film.
PB: I see, so were there any difficulties in transferring a story which is obviously rooted in U.S. culture, and then transferring those themes and concepts to a story which would fit in with Korean culture?
KSH: Yes, there were many difficulties, however I'd say the one biggest difference from a cultural perspective was that of the Mum and the children living out of the car. In the U.S. perhaps it's not that rare or unusual for people to accept characters who live in a car, but in South Korea such a situation is unthinkable. So I needed to kind of Korean-ize this part of the story, and present it in such a way that it would be acceptable and feasible to a Korean audience. It was a big challenge, and it took me a year to figure out how I could make it sound like a believable story.
PB: How to Steal a Dog features Choi Min-soo, now many readers of COF will be familiar with this actor from their gritty action roles in the likes of The Terrorist and Holiday, and of course the TV drama Sandglass. What was it like to work with him?
KSH: Choi Min-soo obviously came with the reputation of being a tough guy to work with in the Korean film industry, so it's true that many directors tried to avoid working with him. Because of this he's rarely appeared in Korean movies for close to 10 years now, and then of course you have the rumors of them beating up crew members. Perhaps because of these reasons, for me this image that they have made them the perfect fit for the role of the homeless character in the movie.
When I gave them the script, even though the other people who were going to be a part of the production were asking me to not make them work with him, Mr Choi really loved it and was very enthusiastic to participate, even willing to forsake being paid. So actually it became easy to collaborate with him, and one of the things I quickly found out about Mr Choi, is that they like to give opinions on how to direct certain scenes. For me as a director, I like to listen to the opinions from others, and I found their input very helpful, so it turned out to be a good combination for the movie.
PB: In the past you've worked a lot in the short film format, which are usually released as a segment in larger omnibus movies. Is there something in particular that appeals to you about working in the short film format over full length features?
KSH: The first feature film that I directed was Into the Mirror, and it was just after my graduation. I felt like I really needed to prove myself, but at the same time I knew there was a big room for improvement. For me it was especially in the area of being able to direct actors and actores, and conveying the way they should act. Short films really provided me with the experience of being able to direct actors and actores, so I find the short film format is perfect for me. You don't need a lot of investment, and you don't have to worry about being too sensitive regarding the content of the film, so they gave me a lot of opportunities to experiment with different directing styles. Based on the experiences I gained working on those short films, I felt it gave me the skills to be able to confidently direct actors and actores in feature films.
PB: Speaking of Into the Mirror, this movie was really one of the first Korean movies to get widespread distribution in the west. How does it feel to know you were in that first wave of Korean directors to have their movies distributed and gain exposure overseas?
KSH: 2003 was a very significant year for the Korean film industry. It was an important year, and so many great films were released during it, for example Memories of Murder, Save the Green Planet!, and OldBoy. It could almost be interpreted as an internationalization of Korean film, with the huge variety of movies that became successful.
I feel very lucky that I directed a film in that specific year due to its significance, and I really believe that there was an atmosphere within the industry that people would invest in and produce a movie, as long as it had a good script and idea. I feel that's really important in the film industry, however today this has become impossible. It's sad, because I think it was that belief which made the films successful, with the knowledge that the investment and production would be there based on the strength of the script and idea.
PB: In the 00's so many Asian horror movies were re-made by Hollywood, and of course in 2008 Into the Mirror was re-made as Mirrors with Kiefer Sutherland. How did it feel for you, having written and directed the original, knowing it was being re-made into an English language version, and what's your general feeling of Asian movies being re-made by Hollywood?
KSH: When I first heard the news that my film was going to be remade, I was very surprised. For me personally, I find the idea of Asian movies being re-made by Hollywood to be a good idea, because it means the story doesn't just remain within Asia, but it's transferred to America as well. When I watched Mirrors, obviously there were some points that I liked, and there were some points that I didn't like, but my main impression from watching it was of how much budget Hollywood movies are able to get behind them.
Watching Alexandre Aja's version, I realized that they presented some ideas that even I didn't think about when making my version! So I'd say overall, my opinion on Asian movies being re-made by Hollywood is that they take the idea of the film, the core idea, and then they Americanize it to make a U.S. version, which I find really interesting.
PB: That's a great answer. Well I'll pose the question to you, if you could re-make any movie, which one would you choose?
KSH: Actually there are many movies which I'd like to re-make, but how many of them are feasible is a difficult question, as they're usually decided by the producers. One of the films I'd really like to re-make is a French film called The Apartment, and also the Hollywood movie Dead Again. I think the scenarios in these movies would transfer really well into a Korean film.
PB: You're one of the credited screenwriters on 2007's Black House, which was directed by Sin Tae-ra. I noticed in most of your movies you write them and direct them, so in this instance, was it strange to see someone else directing your script?
KSH: Actually I was also supposed to direct Black House, but during the preparation for the film the production company changed, and unfortunately as a result I didn't get to direct it, so Sin Tae-ra ended up as the director. For me the success and feel of a movie comes down to who directs it, so while I was watching the finished film I could see that a lot of my script had been changed, and so rather than still feeling like it was my movie, it made me feel distanced from it due to the changes that were made.
PB: Your 2010 feature film They Came From has quite a meta-feel to it, in that it deals with people working in the movie industry – a director – and the story is manipulated by another character deciding to re-write the script. In some ways it echoes the alternate realities that are touched on in Into the Mirror. Are these aspects of your work something that you're drawn to?
KSH: Wow, you've done a lot of research! (laughter) Yes I think I like this theme a lot, and when I was directing They Came From it was actually quite experimental. I started the film without any script, so I attempted to direct a film with two actores for two weeks, and we didn't really have a story. So I think that structure wise it was very experimental, and you know the alternative reality scenes are something that I really like. I believe I borrowed the idea from David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, and I think this kind of ideas will continue to produce interesting movies in the future.
PB: Great, and for the final question, what can we look forward to next from Kim Sung-ho?
KSH: There's a Korean web-toon called Gallbladder, which is the story of a little boy who's trying to find their mother, and for some reason they get captured. After 15 years he's mysteriously released with 400 kilograms of gold. Obviously they don't know why they were captured or by whom, they only knows that they still need to find their mother, however with all the gold he's now carrying, they get a lot of attention from many unscrupulous characters who want to take it. At the moment I'm working on the script, and it's going to be an action movie
PB: Sounds great, and we'll be looking forward to hearing more about it! Good luck for your movie screening tonight, and thanks again for taking the time to talk.
KSH: Thank you.
A big thanks to David Park for setting up the interview, and Soyoung Kim Greeberg for their excellent translation skills.

Researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, have shown capuchin monkeys, just like humans, find giving to be a satisfying experience. This finding comes on the coattails of a recent imaging study in humans that documented activity in reward centers of the brain after humans gave to charity. Empathy in seeing the pleasure of another's fortune is thought to be the impetus for sharing, a trait this study shows transcends primate species.
The study is available online in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Frans de Waal, PhD, director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes Research Center, and Kristi Leimgruber, research specialist, led a team of researchers who exchanged tokens for food with eight adult female capuchins. Each capuchin was paired with a relative, an unrelated familiar female from their own social group or a stranger (a female from a different group). The capuchins then were given the choice of two tokens: the selfish option, which rewarded that capuchin alone with an apple slice; or the prosocial option, which rewarded both capuchins with an apple slice. The monkeys predominantly selected the prosocial token when paired with a relative or familiar individual but not when paired with a stranger.
"The fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them," said de Waal. "We believe prosocial behavior is empathy based. Empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness, and in our study, closer partners made more prosocial choices. They seem to care for the welfare of those they know," continued de Waal.
de Waal and their research team next will attempt to determine whether giving is self-rewarding to capuchins because they can eat together or if the monkeys simply like to see the other monkey enjoying food.

Liza Diño replaces Briccio G. Santos who has headed the agency since 2010
Published 2:23 PM, August 12, 2016
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte has appointed Liza Diño as chairperson of the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) for a term of 3 years, Malacañang announced on Friday, August 12.
Diño replaces Briccio G. Santos who has headed the agency since 2010.
The FDCP, created under Republic Act No. 9167, is mandated to formulate and implement policies and programs to upgrade the craft of filmmaking, among others.
Malacañang announced the latest presidential appointments on Friday, which included celebrity couple Diño and Aiza Seguerra, who was named chairperson of the National Youth Commission.
Prior to their appointment, Duterte has asked for the couple's help in promoting arts and culture.
"We are very pleased to know that the thrust of the Duterte administration's social agenda is to give importance to culture as one of the main components in nation building," Diño said in a previous social media post.
Diño is a multi-awarded actor who has appeared in independent and mainstream films.
They won the Ani ng Dangal Award in 2010 and 2012 for Compound and In Nomine Matris, respectively. They also bagged the Best Actress Award at the International Film Festival Manhattan New York, and Best Female Performance at the Equality International Film Festival for In Nomine Matris in 2012.
Diño and Aiza have been a vocal supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte since they emerged as a presidential candidate, and campaigned for them on social media and at rallies.
Despite their support for Duterte, Diño had criticized the president for whistling and offending GMA reporter Mariz Umali during a press conference in Davao City.
"From their mouth towards a receiver – the burden of context now lies not with him, but with Mariz. And Mariz said and felt it was improper," Diño said.
In September 2015, Diño also supported the Lumads in their fight against the alleged attacks and killings in their community.
Diño and Seguerra are the latest celebrity supporters of Duterte to get posts in the new administration. Among the others are singer Jimmy Bondoc and comedian Arnell Ignacio, who have appointed as assistant vice presidents at the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR).
Freddie Aguilar earlier said Duterte had tapped them to chair the National Commission on Culture and the Arts, but the position is subject to election by the NCCA board. – Rappler.com
C4 is an explosive satchel charge, deployed with right click, and detonated with left click.
You can use the Toolbox to calculate exact C4 damage PlanetSide 2 units.
Cost
Rank 1: 200 Certs.
Allows to carry and deploy 1 brick of C4.
Rank 2: 500 Certs.
Allows to carry and deploy 2 bricks of C4.
Spawning with one brick of C4 costs 75 Nanites.
C4 is available to all classes, except MAXes and Infiltrators. Must be unlocked for each class individually.
Damage
1250 @ 2.5m – 10 @ 5m (source)
Resist Type 11 – “C-4”. Not affected by Armor.
MAXes and all vehicles have negative resistance to C4, meaning they take bonus damage from it.
List of vehicles' resistances to C4 Harasser (-75%)
MAX (-65%)
Flash (-100%)
Sunderer (-40%)
Lightning (-100%)
Magrider (-100%)
Vanguard (-140%)
Prowler (-100%)
ESF (-150%)
Liberator (-80%)
Galaxy (-30%)
Valkyrie (-150%)
ANT (-40%) Harasser (-75%)
MAX (-65%)
Flash (-100%)
Sunderer (-40%)
Lightning (-100%)
Magrider (-100%)
Vanguard (-140%)
Prowler (-100%)
ESF (-150%)
Liberator (-80%)
Galaxy (-30%)
Valkyrie (-150%)
ANT (-40%)
Flak Armor 5 reduces C4 damage to infantry by 50%. You will get a special indicator if you damage a target equipped with Flak Armor.
Vehicles and MAXes can reduce C4 damage with Ordnance Armor 3 for MAXes, Blockade Armor for Sunderers and Flanker Armor for tanks.
One C4 brick kills: MAXes without Ordnance Armor 3 within 2.5m. Infantry without Flak Armor within 3m. ESF without Composite Armor. ESF with Composite Armor will be put into burning state. Valkyries without Composite Armor will be put into burning state.
Two C4 bricks kill: MAXes with Ordnance Armor 3 within 3m. MBTs without Flanker Armor within 2.5m. MBTs with Flanker Armor will be put into burning state. Lightnings without Flanker Armor within 3m, and Lightnings with Flanker Armor within 2.5m. Harassers.
Three C4 bricks kill: Sunderers without Blockade Armor ANTs MBTs with Flanker Armor. Liberators without Composite Armor 2+
Four C4 bricks kill: Liberator with full Composite Armor.
Deployment
Placing and detonating one brick takes about 1.6 seconds.
Two bricks take 2.6 seconds.
Deploying and detonating C4 does not make you appear on the enemy minimap like shooting does. But the enemy can silently Q-spot your deployed C4 to warn allies about it.
C4 can be thrown to a distance of around 7m. C4 sticks to vehicles, MAXes, surfaces, ceilings, other deployables and even grenades, but not infantry. It's a common trick to attach C4 to your own vehicle and use it to deliver the C4 to the target.
Engineer's Demolitions Pouch Suit Slot allows carrying and deploy one additional C4 brick per rank of Suit Slot, up to 2. So up to 4x C4 in total.
C4 does not despawn if you change class or resupply at the terminal, but you cannot deploy more C4 than you can carry with yourself. Attempting to deploy additional brick will result in first C4 brick disappearing.
Example: you're a Light Assault with C4 Rank 2. You can carry and deploy 2x C4. If you deploy both bricks, then resupply at a terminal, you will have 2x C4 deployed and 2x C4 carried with yourself. If you try to deploy a third brick, first brick will disappear. But you can detonate first 2x C4 bricks, and then deploy 2x C4 more.
C4 ARX, which can be unlocked through Explosives Directives, has a separate placement limit. Together with regular C4, and if you use Demolition Pouch 2, you can have up to 8 bricks deployed at the same time. Prooflink.
Deployed C4 can be deconstructed by Engineer's Repair Tool, same as Tank Mines. C4 is also destroyed without detonation by EMP grenades from enemy Infiltrators.
C4 does not disappear if you die, but it does when you respawn. Revives don't count as respawning.
Detonation
Simplest way is with the C4 detonator (left click), which has a 0.5 second startup time.
If you deploy C4 with one class, and then switch to any other class with C4 equipped, you can detonate already deployed C4 with detonator.
Bullets and other explosives will also detonate C4. You can even place a C4 brick on a Flash with machine gun in such a way, that you'll be able to detonate the C4 with Flash's machine gun – which would mean suicide, of course.
The player that detonated C4 – by any means – will receive the credit for kills. It doesn't matter whose C4 it was. However, if another player detonates your C4, you both will receive XP.
Known Bugs
All of these bugs haven't been seen for a long time, it's possible all of them have been fixed by now.
Sometimes C4 disappears after throwing.
Sometimes C4 detonates not where you have placed it, but where the C4 brick was several seconds ago. This is especially apparent when trying to C4 moving vehicles.
As a possible repercussion of this bug, sometimes C4 attached to your own vehicle does not do full damage to nearby enemies, so putting C4 on your Flash and suicide bombing isn't reliable.
When you click the C4 Detonator, and then equip a weapon, on enemy screen you will appear firing that weapon
Tips and Tricks
C4 can also be used to destroy deployables, such as spawn beacons, motion spotters, shield regeneration fields, etc. This is useful when it's too dangerous to go and try to destroy these deployables in person. For example, you can throw C4 over the wall that has spawn beacon behind it.
Similarly, C4 can be used to kill enemies that are behind cover.
Deploying and detonating C4 does not cancel redeploy timer, even if you damage or kill someone with it. Possibly a bug. (unconfirmed after CAI).
Light Assault is considered the best class to use C4 with, because using C4 requires being close to the target, and Light Assault is the best at it, be it through sheer speed of Ambusher Jets, or taking flanking routes over otherwise impassable terrain with other jets.
It's nearly impossible to C4 an occupied vehicle that is paying attention and actively tries to avoid it. Fortunately, it's humanly impossible to be prepared for everything all the time. So wait until the vehicle crew gets distracted, and charge in.
Bad drivers are prone to tunnel vision, staying in one position for prolonged period of time, they rarely have a competent gunner, if any at all, and make a mistake of parking near walls, cliffs and towers, opening you a convenient way of attack.
Here's a piece of lawn gnome's HA guide on destroying vehicles:
By Keith Idec
Enigmatic ex-middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. flippantly indicated on a conference call Tuesday that he'll try to get down to the contracted weight limit of 168 pounds for their super middleweight fight Saturday night against Bryan Vera.
Mexico's Chavez, who hasn't fought since losing to Sergio Martinez in a middleweight title fight last Sept. 15 in Las Vegas, added that they weighed 173 pounds Tuesday. Persistent speculation on social media sites Tuesday suggested Chavez would try to change the contract weight to 173 pounds, but they said that they want to weigh 168 pounds before a California State Athletic Commission weigh-in Friday.
“I just think it's time for me to move up to 168,” Chavez said. “That's the goal for this fight. We want to do our best to get to that weight. … It's not a championship fight, but we want to get as close to 168 as we can.”
Promoter Bob Arum acknowledged on the same a conference call Tuesday that they won't determine until sometime Wednesday what the weight limit will be for the Chavez-Vera fight at StubHub Center in Carson, Calif.
Vera (23-6, 14 KOs) and their handlers likely will seek a substantial financial incentive before agreeing to encounter Chavez (46-1-1, 32 KOs, 1 NC) at a weight higher than 168 pounds in their HBO “World Championship Boxing” main event. Their fight already has been postponed twice, most recently because Chavez suffered a cut over their right eye during a sparring session last month.
“We're going to take a look at what the fighters weigh tomorrow and decide what the weight limit will be on the fight,” said Arum, whose company, Top Rank Inc., promotes Chavez. “I know what Julio Sr. said [about Chavez Jr. not being able to make 168], but I really believe at the time they said it they misspoke.”

Even if they come from affluent families or attend highly rated schools, black students in Ohio continue to lag far behind their white peers in school, according to a analysis of data from state standardized exams.
Even if they come from affluent families or attend highly rated schools, black students in Ohio continue to lag far behind their white peers in school, according to a Dispatch analysis of data from state standardized exams.
On more than two dozen state tests given to students in kindergarten through high school last year, the average passage rate among black students was 64 percent. On average, 87 percent of white students passed.
Disparities between races have existed across the country since schools were physically divided by race, researchers say, but many now view those gaps largely as a product of high poverty among minorities.
In Ohio, though, wide race gaps persist even on a level economic field.
Average passing rates among affluent white students last year topped those of affluent black students by 16 percentage points. Poor, white students outperformed black students from poor and wealthy families.
Disparities between races had been narrowing until about five years ago, data show, but the numbers have changed little since then. Now, amid a renewed focus on the topic, schools face increasing pressure to close gaps.
New state report cards penalized schools this year if certain student groups, including racial minorities, didn�t improve enough over a year. Schools that have long earned high overall marks received D�s and F�s in that area.
At the same time, parents of black students have formed groups in their districts to advocate for minority children. Groups in Westerville, Dublin and Olentangy schools have gathered steam in recent years.
�There are clearly divisions along ethnic lines within the district,� said Vaughn Bell, a Westerville parent who revived a defunct group for black parents last year. �I do believe that schools are failing our African-American students.�
Racial disparities go beyond income, experts say, but wealth plays a role.
The poverty rate among blacks in the U.S. –– 25.8 percent, according to Census data –– is higher than any other race except Native Americans. Poor families, in turn, more often face lower-quality preschool options, researchers say.
�These gaps are traceable back to early-childhood education,� said Shaun Harper, the director of the University of Pennsylvania Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education. �If kids show up in kindergarten not having had high-quality instruction in preschool, they�re already starting behind.�
Coupled with teachers who lack the training to help, gaps remain, Harper said.
Beyond poverty, though, some say schools set the bar too low for minorities.
�We expect less of our low-income students and students of color,� said Natasha Ushomirsky, senior data and policy analyst for Education Trust, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group that works to close achievement gaps.
Studies have found that black and Latino students are less likely to be placed in advanced courses, even if they show promise in a subject. Minority students are also more likely to be taught by less-experienced teachers.
�Our school system is set up in a way that makes these gaps worse rather than making them better,� Ushomirsky said.
Where students live is as important as family income in Ohio, said Damon Asbury, legislative director for the Ohio School Boards Association. Minorities are more likely to live in high concentrations of poverty, they said, while poor, white students might live in safer areas with more public resources.
�All people can learn,� Asbury said. �It�s not the individual; it�s the circumstances they often find themselves in.�
The consequences of achievement gaps can be crushing.
For example, 61 percent of black students in Ohio pass the third-grade reading test, compared with 87 percent of white students.
That�s important because one study found that students who don�t read proficiently by third grade are four times less likely to graduate by age 19. It�s 19 times less likely for poor students who don�t read well by third grade.
�There are huge personal ramifications to the students themselves,� Ushomirsky said. �Too many kids are either not graduating from high school at all, or they�re graduating not prepared to do what they want to do next.�
Some of the widest gaps in Ohio are in urban schools, which have long struggled to improve scores among large minority populations.
In 2010, less than 5 percent of black students passed the Ohio third-grade reading exam at Lincoln Park Elementary, a majority of black school at the time. More than 70 percent of white students at the Columbus school passed.
But even in suburban districts, including Dublin, Worthington and Westerville, there are schools where whites routinely outperform blacks by wide margins.
Some schools have added more minority teachers, which parents are lobbying for in Westerville.
�The overwhelming number of teachers are white; they connect better with white students than minority students,� said Bell, of the parent group.
McVay Elementary School in Westerville has had some of the widest gaps in third-grade reading proficiency between black and white students for the past five years. The smallest gap in that period was 20 percentage points.
�When you�re talking about a racial gap, it�s a pretty uncomfortable subject,� Principal Amy Miller said. �But you have to just say, �This is our data and it�s telling us something matters here, and we need to figure out what to do about it.�?�
This year, teachers at McVay are working to pinpoint more quickly where individual students –– not groups –– need help. That approach helped at nearby Annehurst Elementary, which the state has honored for closing gaps.
McVay also added a reading specialist to help students, and the school is focusing on third-grade reading. Teachers, too, are having open discussions about race and breaking down preconceived notions. Miller believes that those changes will help.
Ultimately, though, there is no magic bullet.
Some experts such as Ushomirsky argue for school-level solutions, such as pairing top teachers with low-performing students. Harper says governments need to invest more in minority neighborhoods. Both agree that the stakes are clear.
�If we don�t do something about these inequities, the long-term consequences for our economy are enormous,� Harper said. �Inevitably we will see more poverty, more crime and so on.� cbinkley@dispatch.com

When a devastated neighbor witnessed a three-month-old puppy being tossed over a high fence on Wednesday night, they reached out for help to Jackie O'Sullivan, co-founder of Rescue Dogs Rock NYC.
The pup was immediately rushed from Fulton County Animal Services in Atlanta, Georgia to the rescue's veterinary partner where the tiny pooch dubbed Caleb had far worse injuries than expected as the result of a cruel fall. Their initial shocking injury report included the following:
“Upon being examined by the medical team they discovered this puppy was in far worse shape than originally known,” stated Jackie. “Poor Caleb suffered not only head trauma, but he's clearly emaciated, covered in what looks to be old cigarette burns, and they found an “abnormal” anus! The medical team was so upset by their condition that a cruelty investigation is being started. There is no question that Caleb suffered cruel and sadistic torture over time. They also discovered they have a broken jaw.”
While it cannot be proven that Caleb had been sexually assaulted, it doesn't take much to see that they were abused. Miraculously Caleb survived the night and is being transferred this morning to a more specialized veterinary hospital for the best care possible. Their white blood cell count is extremely low, and the tiny pooch remains in septic shock. Veterinarians give Caleb a 30% of survival. If ever an innocent puppy needed an angel to guard over him, this is everyone's wish this morning. Caleb's fight for life can be followed on Facebook here.

The fugitive ex-police officer Christopher Dorner, suspected of killing three people and injuring two, had a history of making complaints against fellow officers within the Los Angeles Police Department, and one officer said they had a reputation as a "hot head," according to internal affairs records.
Dorner was accused of punching a recruit in the chest while they were in the Police Academy in 2006. That recruit, Abraham Schefres, was wearing a bulletproof vest and a trauma plate, when Dorner allegedly punched him. After being hit, they glared at Dorner, whom Schefres said responded as though they had made a mistake, records show. Schefres said they believed that Dorner had not been trying to hurt them but that the punch was "more of a 'hello'" and to appear tough.
Schefres told an investigator that they "believed this was part of Dorner's persona," records show. Schefres described Dorner as "a hot head" who would walk up to fellow recruits and "get in their faces in an aggressive" but joking way.
TIMELINE: Manhunt for ex-LAPD officer
Dorner, 33, is wanted in connection with a double homicide in Irvine on Sunday and the shooting of three police officers, one fatally, in Riverside County on Thursday.
Authorities described them as armed and extremely dangerous, and alerts about them were issued across California and Nevada as federal, state and local authorities intensified their search.
Police say Dorner embarked on a campaign of deadly violence to exact revenge on those they blamed for their firing.
DOCUMENT: Read the manifesto
In 2006, Schefres was interviewed about the punching incident during an investigation into allegations that Dorner slapped the hand of another recruit officer, internal affairs records show. Dorner had accused that second recruit--as well as another recruit -- of using a racial slur while they were traveling in a police vehicle during their time in the academy.
The department confirmed Dorner's slur allegation against one of the recruits but not the other, the records said. The agency concluded that Dorner's punch of Schefres did not rise to the level of misconduct.
By then, Dorner was serving a military deployment overseas for the Navy. They returned to the LAPD in the summer of 2007, and in August accused their training officer, Teresa Evans, of kicking a mentally ill man during an arrest in San Pedro.
FULL COVERAGE: Sweeping manhunt for ex-cop
Two months later, Dorner lodged another complaint against fellow cops, according to an LAPD complaint review report. Dorner said that after work on Oct. 10, 2007, they discovered that their jacket, on top of their duty bag, "was wet and dirty," according to the report.
They believed someone had urinated on it. Dorner testified at a disciplinary hearing that they believed that they had been singled out in retaliation for their complaint against Evans.
Sony Pictures Television Networks announced on Monday that it will acquire the majority stake in Funimation Entertainment. The agreement, which values the company at about US$150 million, will still have to go through regulatory approvals and other conditions for closing. Funimation CEO Gen Fukunaga will retain their position and a minority stake in the business.
Deadline and Variety report that the majority stake is 95%, purchased at US$143 million.
Bloomberg reported in May that Sony Pictures had weighed bidding on the anime distributor.
Sony Pictures Television Networks operates branded linear television and digital networks, including Japanese satellite anime channel Animax and streaming service Crackle. Earlier this year, Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan formed a joint venture company with Mitsui & Co., the company that owns the majority stake in anime channel Kids Station. The joint venture, AK Holdings, serves as the management company for both Animax and Kids Station, and plans to hold worldwide events to expand the global anime market.
"Around the world, Sony's networks have been major players in the anime space for nearly two decades, and in more recent years we have rapidly increased our networks' over-the-top and digital offerings to consumers," Andy Kaplan, president of Worldwide Networks at Sony Pictures Television, said in a statement. "With the acquisition of Funimation, the combined IP of Animax, Kids Station and Funimation allows us to deliver the best anime to fans across all screens and platforms."

Whether you have historically found yourself aligning with the traditional political left (Democrats) or the traditional political right (Republicans), it really matters not. In the next several months we are about to see some very uncomfortable truths.
To our friends from the “Conservative Right”, we simply share a message: if we thought candidate Donald Trump had already revealed many usurping agents within our collective ranks, we ain't seen nothing yet.
Example:
If we're willing to bear witness, we are about to see just how deep, entrenched and controlling the Globalist/Wall Street financial tentacles are within the party apparatus.
We shall also witness the professional punditry, specific websites, particular radio voices, voluminous writers, historic authors, etc. who gain financial benefit from supporting these same usurping agents.
When you define beneficiaries as Wall Street Corps the U.S. CoC is correct. For U.S. workers it's been a disaster. https://t.co/6x9fhXOJMx — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) June 28, 2016
On the political right these are the agents/minions of the U.S. CoC and Tom Donohue. They are not dissimilar to the political left and George Soros. Their objectives are synergistic.
For several years our research has been leading toward a larger understanding. The financial constructs are way bigger deeper than anyone has yet to fathom. There are trillions at stake.
Trump's economic speech obviously put these various Wall Street agents on notice today. They are now forced to come out of the shadows and attack.
Just watch….

FT. LAUDERDALE (CBSMiami.com) – Would you want a convicted rapist as your doctor? In Florida, that's apparently OK, according the the Florida Board of Medicine, which voted Friday to allow a doctor who raped a co-worker to return to medical practice. The board decided being a rapist had nothing to do with being a good doctor.
The board, meeting in Ft. Lauderdale, made the decision in the case of Tampa doctor Mark Seldes a former Air Force flight surgeon who was serving in South Korea when they were accused of raping a civilian co-worker. They were convicted in a military court-martial in 2008, served 3 years in prison, and was dismissed from the service for rape and adultery. They were also forced to be registered as a sex offender, and appears in the Florida Sex Offender Registry.
Dr. Seldes could have been sentenced to life in prison.
An account of the case in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes said the rape victim was asleep, under medication, at the time the assault occurred. Their attorney claimed the assault was not violent, and that the two had a previous sexual relationship. The Stars and Stripes said the two had been together for a week and not had a full sexual experience before the rape.
In addition to being a rapist, the assault happened as Seldes was cheating on their wife in an affair with theirs victim.
In their court martial, their military lawyer asked the jury to consider the fact they had long service with the military, and the fact they were “losing their medical career.”
Apparently, the State of Florida sees things differently.
No longer in the military, Dr. Seldes wanted Florida to allow them to resume that career and practice medicine in the state, despite the rape conviction.
“He was a man who made a terrible mistake to engage in a relationship with an individual who was not their wife, and has destroyed their career and has certainly brought dire consequences on their marriage,” Attorney Kenneth Haber said.
“Anytime the word rape is used, it rises to a level that gives me great concern, and I'm unwilling to say that this doctor should keep practicing in Florida,” said Don Mullins, a consumer member of the board.”
But one of the physicians on the panel strongly disagreed.
“I take a different view,” Dr. Zach Zachariah said. “In my personal opinion, they have paid their penance.
In the end, the board voted 7-3 to allow Seldes to practice, so long as they complete 300 hours of community service, remains in a monitoring program for troubled physicians, and works in a government facility.
The state agreed not to put them on formal probation, after Seldes argued that probation might make it hard for them to get a job in the future.
Seldes' wife looked on as the panel allowed their husband to resume their life as a doctor. It was not known if their victim was present at the hearing..
Kaitlyn Hunt, the 18-year-old Florida girl who made international headlines after being charged with felonies for their same-sex relationship with a 15-year-old peer, has refused a plea deal offered by the state attorney's office, according to CBS affiliate WPEC.
Under the state attorney's deal, Hunt would have been labeled a sex offender and placed on two years' house arrest, according to NBC affiliate WPTV.
Hunt will appear in court June 20, and could face 15 years in prison if convicted.
In a statement obtained by The Huffington Post, Hunt's attorney, Julia Graves, wrote, "This is a situation of two teenagers who happen to be of the same sex involved in a relationship. If this case involved a boy and girl, there would be no media attention to this case. ... If this incident occurred 108 days earlier when they were 17, we wouldn't even be here."
Hunt faced two felony counts of "lewd and lascivious battery on a child 12 to 16" after the parents of their girlfriend pressed charges earlier this year. The Hunt family said this week that a plea deal would only be acceptable if the charges were reduced to a misdemeanor, according to CBS.
"There are colleges that will not let felons do certain things, or child abuse charges, where you can't supervise field trips or your own children later, you can't participate in things," Graves said in a news conference Wednesday. "These are things that will certainly affect their future if they take this current plea offer."
On Tuesday the ACLU of Florida issued a statement condemning the state's prosecution of Hunt "for engaging in behavior that is both fairly innocuous and extremely common."
"This is a life sentence for behavior by teenagers that is all too common, whether they are male or female, gay or straight. High-school relationships may be fleeting, but felony convictions are not," the ACLU statement read.
According WPTV, Charles Sullivan Jr., an attorney for the family of Hunt's girlfriend, said that whether Hunt has received unfair treatment is not the matter at hand. "The statute clearly prohibits minors from having sexual relations with adults. The consent of the minor is not an issue, nor should it be an issue. That's the message in this case, that a crime was committed, and it's being prosecuted," Sullivan told the station.
In statements posted to a Facebook group supporting the accused teen, Hunt's parents allege that their daughter's relationship with their girlfriend, who was 14 when they began dating, was known to the other girl's parents. They implied that the other girl's parents waited until Hunt turned 18 to press charges.
"These people never came to us as parents, never tried to speak to us ... and tell us they had a problem with the girls dating," Kaitlyn Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt-Smith, wrote. "They were out to destroy my daughter. [They] feel like my daughter 'made' their daughter gay."
According to WTSP, on Monday, Indian River County Sheriff Deryl Loar said that sexual orientation had no bearing on the prosecution of the high school senior. "If this was an 18-year-old male and that was a 14-year-old girl, it would have been prosecuted the same way," they said.
While critics have argued that homophobia may be central to the prosecution of Hunt, some have written that the case is also indicative of a double-standard in the prosecution of teenage sexual relationships.
Slate's Emily Bazelon says of the case:
Griffiths, a standout performer for Glory through the highs and lows of last season, sought a release from the club in search of an overseas opportunity and was expected to return to Asia where they spent two seasons with Guangzhou R&F.
But Roda, once home to Graham Arnold, Zeljko Kalac and Gary van Egmond, made an approach late last week and the formalities were concluded on Saturday night.
Roda is back in the Eredivisie after being relegated two years ago and is looking to cement its place in the top division under coach Darije Kalezic.
Australian agent Dragan Jevtic, who brokered the deal, said: "This is a chance for Rostyn to compete at a great level for a club which is on the up and back where it belongs this season.
"They were keen to get them on board and now they have the opportunity to excel in one of Europe's best leagues.
"Rostyn wants to test themselves at the highest level possible and can't wait to get started now."

People described as rushing to highway to try to gather leaking fuel from crashed vehicle and being caught in blast
An overturned oil tanker exploded in a huge fireball in Pakistan on Sunday killing more than 150 people, including many women and children, who had rushed to the site to collect fuel spilling from the crashed vehicle.
Witnesses described terrifying scenes at the site in the city of Ahmad Pur Sharqia, Punjab province.
Ejaz Hussain Lashari, a student, said: “I heard everyone sitting nearby crying for help. You couldn't understand what they were saying. I could only understand everyone was calling for help. I saw a woman holding a jerry can scream ‘my baby, please tell me where my little baby is'. Unfortunately we couldn't do anything.”
Survivors described an explosion, like a bomb going off, in the blaze, which could have been sparked by a dropped cigarette, as villagers went running with jerry cans and buckets to collect the spilt fuel, after the tanker toppled off the main road near Bahawalpur.
The tanker, which was going from Karachi to Lahore and carrying 25,000 litres (5,500 gallons) of fuel, might have had a tyre blow out while rounding a steep bend just before 6.30am.
As the fire spread, many of those who died were holding containers full of fuel. Local news showed billowing clouds of black smoke, and the road littered with burnt out cars and motorbikes.
Lashari said that by the time the first fire crew arrived, 30 minutes after the fire started, “everything was burned into ashes, bodies were beyond recognition and the injured were screaming”. They said a huge crowd had gathered at the scene before the explosion. “Who knows if someone lit a cigarette?”
A loudspeaker on top of a local mosque alerted villagers to the leaking fuel, and scores raced to the site with jerry cans, said Rana Mohammad Salim, deputy commissioner of Bahawalpur.
Shukat Hayat, an inspector general with the motorway police, said officers tried to keep people away but were overwhelmed by the size of the crowd. It was too early to establish the cause of the disaster, they said.
The dash to collect the fuel can in part be explained by Pakistan's chronic energy crisis, with frequent electricity blackouts exacerbating anger at the government.
Dozens of people were taken to District Headquarters hospital and Bahawal Victoria hospital, the nearest big health facility, where only days ago local community leaders had called for a burns unit to be established.
People with up to 80% burn injuries were ferried to the combined military hospital at Multan.
Local officials on Sunday put the death toll at 153, with many more injured. “Around forty bodies were beyond recognition,” said Baqir Hussain, a rescue official from the area. Punjabi government officials said DNA evidence would have to be used to identify many of the bodies.
The death toll could rise further as another 50 people are still in critical condition.
Shahid Iqbal was approaching the site when they saw the black cloud of smoke rise. Many people from their village had already hurried there with containers hoping to collect fuel.
“The first thing came in my mind, a bomb went off, as security situation in the country was already tense,” they said. “Then people started shouting it's a tanker that has caught fire. We started moving close to the site but the fireball that was there; there was nothing we could do.We couldn't go close to it.”
Saznoor Ahmad, 30, whose two cousins were killed in the fire, said the crowd of people screamed as the flames engulfed them. “The fire moved so fast,” they said.
When the fire erupted, the mosque loudspeaker called on the remaining villagers to help put it out.
Mohammed Salim ran toward the smoke carrying buckets of water and sand, but said the heat was too intense to reach those in need. “I could hear people screaming but I couldn't get to them,” they said.
Abdul Malik, a local police officer who was also among the first to arrive, said: “I have never seen anything like it in my life. Victims trapped in the fireball. They were screaming for help,” they said.
Firefighters fought the flames for more than two hours before they were put out. When the flames subsided the field was strewn with bodies, and nearby were the charred shells of motorcycles and cars that the villagers had used to race to the scene.
As the wounded cried out for help, residents wandered through the area looking for loved ones.
Zulkha Bibi was searching for their two sons. “Someone should tell me about my beloved sons, where are they? Are they alive or are they no longer in this world? Please tell me,” they pleaded.

The prime minister's office said the Punjab provincial government had been directed to provide full medical assistance.
“Prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has expressed deep grief over the heavy loss of life in the unfortunate accident of oil tanker fire at Ahmad Pur Sharqia, Bahawalpur,” the statement said.
Imran Khan, the leader of the Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI), said it was a “national tragedy of epic proportions”.
Pakistan has an appalling record of fatal traffic accidents due to poor roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.
At least 65 people were killed in a similar incident 18 years ago in Punjab, when an overturned fuel truck in Adda Rodu Sultan exploded just as dozens had gathered to collect petrol.
The start of the NAFTA renegotiation process is working through a final hurdle in the U.S. Senate — one imposed by a famous member of President Donald Trump's own party, in a symbolic example of the free-trade rift between the past and present of the GOP.
The party leadership began closure proceedings late Tuesday to force a vote on the confirmation of Trump's trade czar. That means a few more days of debate, followed by Robert Lighthizer's likely confirmation, which would let them start preparing for negotiations later this year with Canada and Mexico.
One reason it didn't happen sooner: unanimous consent was denied by John McCain.

China beckons Canada and Mexico in face of U.S. uncertainty: Mexican minister
The Republican icon and onetime presidential nominee dismissed suggestions he's been nursing a grudge. Lighthizer wrote a mildly critical newspaper column in 2008 that said McCain's support of free trade didn't prove they were conservative.
Rather, McCain said, it's a matter of principle. They said they have been asking questions, and awaiting answers from Lighthizer, about free trade, an issue central to the Republican party orthodoxy in the pre-Trump era.
“It has a lot to do with whether a trade representative is for free trade or not. Or whether they want to be further isolationists and destroy our economy,” McCain said Tuesday on Capitol Hill.
“I'm not saying I'm opposing him. I want answers to the questions. That's what senators do. That's the right of a senator. It's normal. It's what we do every day.”
The administration desperately hopes to get moving on NAFTA. Once Lighthizer is confirmed, it could file its 90-day notice before starting negotiations. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says they hope Lighthizer gets confirmed as early as this week.
Ross said there's mounting time pressure. With the Mexican election approaching and the U.S. midterm elections shortly thereafter, both the Mexican and American administrations have said they want a deal by early 2018.
Failure to seal an agreement by then could delay things to 2019.
“The Senate has been slow-walking the confirmation of Bob Lighthizer,” Ross told a conference at the State Department. “We will seek a far more aggressive meeting schedule (on NAFTA this fall) than has been the norm thus far.”
They repeated their frequently stated position that he's willing to negotiate a bilateral or trilateral deal, and isn't particularly wedded to either approach.
Lighthizer's confirmation should be a fait accompli, once it's up for a vote. Many Democrats sound ready to support him. The progressive, trade-skeptical Sherrod Brown of Ohio said he's spoken to Lighthizer four times since their confirmation hearing, really likes him, and can't understand what's taking so long.
“I think he's one of the best — maybe the best — single Trump nominee so far,” Brown said. While Democrats had earlier held up the nomination over a procedural issue, Sen. Claire McCaskill said it's Republicans delaying now: “They're having trouble on their side of the aisle. It's not us.”
This bizarre role-reversal reflects the fact that, in U.S. politics, attitudes to trade don't follow neat partisan lines.
And whatever lines existed are shifting in the Trump era, according to a new poll.
A survey conducted in the runup to the renegotiations of NAFTA finds majority support for the agreement in all three countries involved. The Pew Research survey finds that of those who took part in the poll, 76 per cent of Canadian respondents, 60 per cent of Mexicans and 51 per cent of Americans supported NAFTA.
But there's turbulence under the surface of U.S. public opinion.
The poll suggests a massive gap in partisan attitudes, with only 30 per cent of respondents who voted Republican supporting NAFTA compared with 68 per cent of Democrats. That's the opposite of the partisan breakdown of a few years ago — and suggests a major Trump effect.
Republicans are suddenly the more trade-skeptical party, in keeping with Trump's attitude and shifting away from the views of Senate Republicans — like McCain.
The veteran senator finished the day with a forceful defence of NAFTA.
In a panel discussion at the U.S. State Department, they shared memories of its 1992 signing, describing a moving speech by Brian Mulroney and a celebration with Mexico's president. They said it has benefited all countries, now supports 200,000 jobs in their home state of Arizona, and has given the U.S. a great gift: a more stable southern neighbour, with a growing middle class.
“I'm sorry I get so passionate about it,” McCain said. “I happen to believe in free trade.”
The Slow Adoption of Wear
Smartwatches were touted to be the next revolution in personal computing for the past 3 years, each time with analysts claiming, adamantly and viscously, that the smartwatch revolution was around the corner. First it was 2013, the year that saw the release of the Pebble – but other than this addition to the category, there was not much else to remember. People were expecting Apple to come and take the world by storm by blowing everyone's expectations with an “iWatch” that would finally force the smartwatch to come of age. But alas, the smartwatches of 2013 came and went with little to no mainstream recognition, and left those extremely-early adopters of the technology largely disappointed, aside from part of the Pebble userbase. The smartwatch market sold a tiny fraction of its big brother industry, with a mere 3 million units having hit consumers' wrists. Although this number surpassed the prior year's 300,000 units, considering it was the first year with notable releases it was a disappointment both felt in OEM wallets and consumer's minds.
With this disappointment of a year, technology analysts became a little more skeptic in their forecasts, and there was more rational debate than before about whether 2014 would see the day where smartwatches would transition to a mature product worthy of mass consumerism. However, the market-watchers and logistics still had volatile predictions as to what would happen, with Canalys estimating a shipping of 5 million where as the more optimistic and renowned Forbes predicted the market would hit 15 million devices. While we still haven't heard official figures from reports, and while we can't predict whether either the optimistic or pessimistic forecasts were correct, something is clear: Smartwatches still haven't had the impact that many expected it to have, with mainstream adoption still being delayed.
Optimism
When Pebble released its kickstarter campaign in 2012, the internet was set ablaze with the idea of such a device. The companies looking to compete with Pebble Technology had names and correspondingly fitting hardware ranging from OEMs like Martian or Cookoo – both offering rather stale and uninspiring smartwatches. But Pebble featured all the things current smartwatches inherited: applications, customization, notification glancing and the most important aspect: support from developers. The reception was good across the board, with even the most popular technology news sites being genuinely optimistic about such an opportunity.
With its 2013 release, Pebble dramatically stepped up the wearables industry by raising the standards. Despite its limited hardware – that features physical side buttons, a pixelated, black and white e-paper LCD screen, and a little vibration engine to alert you of what's going on, Pebble's humble approach, competitive price and viral fame led to it being the first proper smartwatch in many critics' eyes. Soon enough people saw apps springing up from sports news to advanced automation. This finally looked like a “smart” smartwatch.
But the Pebble wouldn't penetrate the mainstream market despite all the functionality it offered. Perhaps it was the cumbersome controls, the unattractive carcass or the fact that many people didn't – and still don't – see a valid reason to justify spending over a hundred dollars on something that allows you to do what you can already do on your phone.
The year was not entirely the Pebble's spotlight, though. Samsung's Galaxy Gear featured an Android-based OS that allowed you to check notifications and do some other things on a pretty color screen or take pretty pictures with a camera awkwardly mounted on the wrist strap. But whilst this was the best selling smartwatch of the year, the critics mostly overlooked it for not providing the same degree of functionality, customizability, and general developer and app support as the Pebble.
Reviewers noted that 2013 marked a change in paradigm of what a smartwatch could and should do. However, despite Pebble's high consumer-satisfaction rates and widespread acclaim in more tech-fan circles, it didn't prove enough to push the smartwatch forward while carrying the burden of its failed competitors.
Early in 2014, rumors of a Google watch began spreading, while those of the missing iWatch strengthened. As time passed, the expectations grew higher until Motorola unveiled its Moto 360 in March of 2014. The device was universally considered the most beautiful smartwatch yet, and the enticing idea of an Android system entirely built with smartwatches in mind delighted the tech aficionados. After providing developers time to play around with development kits, Android Wear was released at Google I/O 2014, with the Moto 360 being delayed but having LG provide us its G Watch and Samsung its Gear Live. Android Wear allowed developers an unprecedented amount of freedom in app development, aided by direct support from Google with guidelines and documentation.
I personally picked up a Gear Live expecting Android Wear to thrive with functionality, and was excited to see the growth of a brand-new platform from its inception – an exciting opportunity that had the potential to finally turn the smartwatch into the revolution it was touted to be for years.
What Went Wrong
For the past few months, the world of Android Wear has seen little innovation. While Google has provided us with much-needed updates (up until the Moto 360's releases and complimentary OTA, my Gear Live featured sluggish performance and sub-par battery life), none of them substantially improved upon the formula that they introduced at Google I/O. Many users were left with buyers remorse, and while I wasn't one of them, I became the one that ends up responding the impressed acquaintance's question of “should I buy one?” with “probably not”.
In the same time frame as the latest 5.0 OTA for Android Wear, we saw the release of a Wear section to the Playstore. Before this, keeping tabs on Android wear development and app releases was rather complicated and involved actively searching for new content on forums. But to me, this new section showcases the conflict between Google's promoted use-cases for Wear and the potential it could have.
The section contains 187 applications, but many of the ones listed don't really add anything to Wear – they just allow you to respond to the main apps' notifications like Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp. The rest feature things like note taking and basic calculators, things that are built into the core functionality of Android Wear through voice commands. You've got apps like MediSafe touting Wear support – which is literally just displaying the notification it already displays in a prettier window. Others are games, that don't really have place in a small display on your wrist powered by a battery that allows for very little gameplay time if you want to make it through the day.
Then there's the fact that the apps that aren't like this, like internet browsers or social media readers, directly contradict Google's vision of the platform – that of short, 3 second interactions – and are truly useless except for a few specific scenarios when you consider you must have a smartphone close to you for the smartwatch to do such tasks.
The Problem
So on one hand, the developer communities saw a great opportunity with Wear; but given the realistic usage restrictions of the hardware, guidelines and practicality, the room for creative, original and innovative additions to the app ecosystem is narrow. Then there's the fact that for developer support to be significant there has to be a significant supply of users in circulation, which against most expectations cited earlier in this article, still isn't reality. Smartwatches in general still haven't had the market penetration that many predicted, and there are many reasons for this.
Some blame it on lackluster hardware. The Moto 360 was awaited by enthusiasts partially because it was beautiful enough to finally entice the masses into buying into the trend. But the Moto 360 was blasted by critics during its first few weeks, because of dreadful battery life reports, a screen that didn't dim as power-efficiently as the previous offerings, an old processor that slowed down the phone while sapping it of its battery, and much build quality and hardware complications such as epidemic screen burn-in, cracked backs and dead pixels. What could have been the messiah of Wear failed and disappointed, and by the time many of these issues were addressed or fixed, the hype had gone down and the reviews were in place. The damage was done, and despite the neat circular display and gorgeous chassis, it wasn't enough for people to overlook the defects and bad reputation all while making the leap of faith into an expensive but truly not necessary piece of technology.
Other people say the lack of a strong user base despite all the hype from analysts over the years is due to the fact that there's nothing innovative about Android Wear. While current Google Now on your wrist is something that would have blown all of us 90's kids' minds away back when we were growing up, in the adult world it is hard to justify shelling out hundreds of dollars for something your phone already does and does well. And I'd argue Google Now and all of Wear's voice commands are one of its strongest points, too. But it seems many are content with taking out their phone to check and reply to their notifications and messages.
Applications
I've been asked what kind of apps my watch runs, and when I tell them I don't really use many apps on it, they look at me disappointed. Many casual users equate applications with functionality, and it seems Apple noticed this, as its Apple Watch seems to hold apps as a central part of its user experience, even giving them a galaxy-like drawer for users to find them at. I think this approach is not as efficient as Google's “short interactions”. But when I think about why Wear hasn't seen the growth in popularity and ecosystem both developers and users wanted it to have, I realize that it could just be Google's paradigm holding it down. Ultimately, the revenue for mobile developers come from apps, and apps as we conceive them in smartphones are simply incompatible with the use cases of tiny screens on your wrist that don't live through the day when you use them very much. So in the end, it is not an easily traceable issue, but rather, it is an epiphenomenon. Developers struggle reaching to a small consumer pool with wear apps that don't innovate and don't entice, so people don't consume the apps on their watches because the developers don't have enough justification to put out innovative software. This lack of innovative software turns down potential buyers, which rekindles the slower adoption rate that was predicted, and thus begins the next iteration of the cycle.
In a way, developers are conditioned by the market which is conditioned by developers, and the minimalist paradigm of Google coupled with the real-world unwieldiness of smartwatches. There's potential functionality and innovation that's been mostly untapped, either due to system or hardware restrictions. I'd love to see the ability to initiate in-app actions by saying “Ok Google” from the watchface. But we weren't even allowed to initiate Hangouts conversations through Wear. These sorts of nuances make Wear feel unpolished and critics complained about them time and again, but the infrequent OTAs address such complaints at a steadily short-reaching pace.

Despite the lack of innovative software features or functionality, Wear remains deeply integrated into some users lives including my own. I personally don't believe apps should be the focus of smartwatches nearly as much as Apple intends it to be, but I do realize that apps seem to be one of developers' main ways of benefiting from the existence of such platforms, and after years, most of us have been conditioned to downloading and using apps that enhance our lives.
Maybe Apple will prove that applications can work on a smartwatch in an organic way. Maybe they will push forward developer growth in this sector. Maybe they won't, and maybe Wear will unexpectedly win the wearable OS war that is in the horizon through the help of inspired developers and software innovations. Whatever happens, Wear is still a decent product that just needs some polishing. And while it seems that smartwatches haven't had the estimated boom of the more optimistic analysts, it has met with steady adoption and market growth during 2014 and that is enough to celebrate. Lets just wish there are ways for both consumers and developers to mutually and extensively benefit from the platform's existence in the near future.

What do the American Civil War, the Russian Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Spanish Civil War all have in common? Hundreds of thousands of people died in pursuit of their political freedom. Unfortunately, even today, this is not an uncommon phenomenon, as from sub-Saharan Africa to Asia we see story after story of bloodshed (figuratively) splashed across the headlines. It seems there are too many places in the world where political debate and dissention descend into calamity and death.
Fortunately, not all political grievances result in war and destruction. All too easily distracted by tragic headlines and our own political discord, most Americans are completely unaware of an astoundingly non-violent deliberation occurring in the land of many of our forefathers and mothers: the quest for Scottish independence. On September 18 of this year, 5 million Scots will go to the polls to vote on whether or not to remain a part of the United Kingdom, a 300-year old union. The last 18 months has seen a lively debate; from town hall meetings from the Highlands to Glasgow, to Twitter battles between "cybernats" and pro-unionists. Whether you are a political scientist or just a lover of democracy, the next month or so promises to be an action-packed, contentious, and civil debate over the future of a great country.
This weekend, the Scottish Parliament is hosting the Festival of Politics, a three-day event that is run concurrently with the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and for the second year in a row, I am lucky enough to have been invited to participate. My involvement in this Festival is predominantly as a pollster, and as such my focus is and has been watching the spate of publicly-released polls in the lead up to the election. As an impartial observer, the data almost universally suggest a strong victory for the pro-union side, Better Together. And as a pollster, my natural instinct is to believe the overwhelming number of polls that project a solid defeat for the Yes Scotland campaign.
However, I would point out one thing for those who might despair a pro-independence defeat in six weeks' time; polls aren't always right. Turnout can be a tricky thing to predict. All political polling is based on a certain set of assumptions -- educated guesses if you will -- of what the electorate will look like on Election Day. The U.S. has had several high-profile examples of where this can lead to some campaign surprises (Mitt Romney and Eric Cantor), and an enthusiasm gap can wreck havoc on a pollster's ability to model polls based on anticipated turnout. It's only natural in a referendum for one side to care more passionately than the other, and there's nothing particularly sexy about "Keep the Status Quo!"
According to Arjen Robben, The Netherlands' shift away from their established 4-3-3 formation to a more unconventional 5-3-2 system has handed them the perfect tactic with which to dismantle Spain's tiki-taka. Yet, how dangerous could this Dutch Plan B be in derailing Vicente Del Bosque's team in Group B?
In a repeat of the 2010 World Cup final – in which former national team coach Bert van Marwijk sent Oranje out to break Spain's game with a ruthlessly physical approach that looked more like total war than total football – The Netherlands will kick off their campaign in Brazil against Xavi & Co. in Salvador.
Robben is adamant that they and their countrymen can overcome their opponents with good football and intelligent organisation rather than ferocity this summer, and cites the Dutch's 2-0 friendly defeat against France in March as the key turning point in their preparations for the tournament. They told De Telegraaf:
“After the France match, I thought long and hard and talked it over with other players. We spent two hours discussing what was best for the team. The coach came up with the idea of playing 5-3-2 and I bought into it. We've always been on board with the Dutch school and intricate football and I believe our strengths still lie in positional play and going forward, but we mustn't be too open.
“We were overrun by France and we knew we would have to be mindful of that against Spain, because otherwise we would have a problem. If we leave big gaps against Spain we will be in trouble. We mustn't give it away at the back and we have enough training days to ensure the team stay together as a unit.”
The defeat to France brought home the fact that van Gaal's preferred 4-3-3 formation was no longer fit for purpose without Kevin Strootman to power up the midfield as the team's box-to-box all-rounder. Along with Robben and Robin van Persie, the Roma midfielder was one of their coach's so-called “big three” players, who were vital in making their initial system work.
And work it did. The Dutch won nine of their 10 games in qualification, scoring 34 goals and only dropping points in a 2-2 draw away to Estonia. Van Persie finished as European joint-top scorer with 11 goals. The road to glory in Brazil looked to be paved with orange.
Without the dynamism and intelligence of the injured Strootman to balance the midfield however, these well laid plans are now unworkable. Yet the switch to a 5-3-2 formation that came in response to that loss is more of a salvage job than a total departure for van Gaal.
Safety in numbers at the back but the same old attacking threats
By bulking up the defence into a five-man barrier of Feyenoord players, Van Gaal has been able to ensure that the role of their two remaining “big three” players – Van Persie and Robben – will stay largely intact. The Manchester United striker will stay as a lone striker, holding up the ball for on-running team-mates, or creating their own chances, while Robben plays in their usual wide position with even more freedom to roam centrally than usual.
Given their familiarity as a unit due to their shared club origins of Stefan de Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi, Darryl Janmaat and, prior to their move to Aston Villa, Ron Vlaar, this back five should be surprisingly settled and organised for an international defence that was only brought together in March. Their reinforced numbers could also cause Spain a few headaches.
As detailed previously on Squawka, the reigning champions have suffered with their own injury problems of late and could struggle to muster up the sort of game-changing impact subs they've relied upon in past tournaments. Jesus Navas won't be available to breakdown stubborn, narrow defences with their speed and wing play.
With Nigel de Jong patrolling the midfield as an aggressive ball-winner to disrupt Spain's passing game, and either Jonathan de Guzman or Leroy Fer likely to start alongside them to offer support and intercept balls through the middle, Spain may find themselves crowded out of their usual positions around their opponents' box, especially if the Dutch are happy to sit deep.
5-3-2 (or 3-4-3 in attack)
Regardless of the potential benefits to stability that may come with smothering the Spanish Plan A, on paper at least, the idea of a five-man defence reads like an overly negative game plan that cedes too much control to the opposition team. After all, by boosting the numbers at the back, the usual slot for another presence on the wing has been cut.
However, with the ball the Netherlands' shape is far more dynamic. As Robben noted regarding the desire to play “intricate football”, Van Gaal's natural desire for attacking fluidity hasn't been extinguished by their need to compromise following the loss of Strootman.
Once possession has been won, the full-backs in their five-man backline will push up to support the midfield, as Wesley Sneijder steps up to feed Van Persie and Robben. In effect, the team shifts into a 3-4-3 formation, not too dissimilar in shape to how the newly appointed Manchester United boss' original 4-3-3 could look at times in attack.
Having previously played as a left-back at club level, Daley Blind has been converted into being a defensive midfielder in more recent seasons, making them a usual, balancing influence on the Dutch midfield. On the other flank, Janmaat can provide more attacking impetus to help threaten from wide positions, and support the free-roaming Robben.
This in turn allows Sneijder greater freedom to peel off and focus on their role as a midfield playmaker, with the foundation behind them secured by the advancing full-backs. In effect, the new 5-3-2 system gives them the secure platform they need to wield enough influence to bring the team's so-called “big three” back up to full strength in the absence of Strootman.
Their creativity and ability to spot openings for Robben and Van Persie will be vital. Shutting a team down to deprive Spain of space is one thing, but finding the passes to turn the tables on them is another. Plenty of sides have succeeded in turning their confrontations with tiki-taka into a scorched earth war of attrition since the style began to dominate club and international football. It's not enough to simply hold on in the hope that some rigid resistance will allow ride out the Spanish and their passing, especially so early on in a tournament, before fatigue begins to blunt their creativity.
If they are able to play their new system as they intend to, the Netherlands' 3-5-2-cum-3-4-3 could give them the numbers they need both in defence and midfield to curb the most obvious threats posed by Del Bosque's champions, while keeping their best attacking stars read to pounce up front.
As ever, though, if Spain arrive in Salvador in peak condition and in the right mind set, no amount of tactical tweaks may be enough to prevent them dismembering a Dutch team who are heading to Brazil hoping to make the most of a back-up plan.
Currently available as a three-way release between Forcefield Records, Inherent Records, and Anti-Corporate Records, the Knoxville, Tenn., trio Argentinum Astrum's second full-length, Malleus Maleficarum, is the band's first studio outing since 2008's self-titled LP. Patience is a virtue, but that's about the only unsullied thing about this mangy beast of a recording: Argentinum Astrum have been letting this material ferment for several years now, and it shows on Malleus Maleficarum, a complex, potent concoction.
The three songs here aim to bridge the gap between doom and black metal, and come awfully close on track one. “I” ambles in with a long, rainy intro, sinking into sludgy Graves At Sea territory out of nowhere before falling into lockstep with correspondingly depraved acts like Dragged Into Sunlight and Lord Mantis. It feels like an older song, written before its creators decided to stretch their legs and try their hand at something different. It's a strange way to structure an album, but Argentinum Astrum have always shown their disdain for convention. Soon, the great heaving gasps of sludge on “I” collapse onto the brittle minor chords and anguished howls in the twin black metal pieces that complete the recording.
There's always been a solid black metal component to Argentinum Astrum, but on “II” and “III,” it takes over completely. “II” is all primal intensity that conjures up associations with Fell Voices (were said Californians unconcerned with the harmonic textures that this band disregard as shimmery melodic frippery), and its successor follows suit. The lead guitar melodies come crackling with a frenetic melodicism that smacks of Cascadian influence as well as Scandinavian flair, swerving sharply towards an ultimately more abrasive sound. By hammering caustic Second Wave tremolo into the more atmospheric riffs, Argentinum Astrum preserve their ferocity without capitulating to boring, rote grimness. Malleus Maleficarum loses points for originality, but makes up for it in execution.
This “best of both world” approach keeps their take on an age-old tradition fresh and compelling, but not too clean: the production values are subterranean, blanketing the recording in a thick miasma of distortion and soot. It's a DIY jobbie through and through, but that lack of polish is exactly what these songs cry out for. Malleus Maleficarum' sounds far more vital choking on ash than blinking glassily through squeaky-clean guitar tones. Some things just work better when they're dirty; after all, you wouldn't hand Andy Sneap a pile of Grave Upheaval demos to polish. Argentinum Astrum know their strengths as well as their weaknesses, and this album is an apt representation of both.
MOHAMMAD ALAM lives with their wife and five children in a mud-brick house in Rafi Nagar, a slum in Mumbai that sits on a vast landfill. They make 200 rupees ($3.15) a day as a ragpicker and wishes they could bribe their way to a card showing they are below the poverty line. It would entitle them to a panoply of benefits, including a grain ration priced at a tenth of what they now pays. But a decade trying to get one through official channels has left them fatalistic about their chance of ever joining the queues at one of the country's 500,000 ration shops. “If I'm destined to get a card, I will get one,” they say.
In Thane, a prosperous Mumbai suburb 20km away, the manager of one such shop says the system is “all bogus”. Perhaps 5% of their cardholding customers are truly poor, they reckon; some have nice houses and government jobs. That is exaggerated, but numerous research shows that cynicism is warranted. One study found that 70% of all those who failed the criteria in one rural area had managed to get a card; ineligible cardholders outnumbered eligible ones. Overall, around half the money India spends on subsidising food is thought to be stolen or claimed by the better-off. Bollywood movies often feature a ration-shop owner as the villain's sidekick.

Public handouts in developing countries are nothing new: India has had them for decades. But in the past few years their number and coverage has soared. A fifth of all those living in developing countries now receive benefits from at least one programme that aims at alleviating poverty, and Martin Ravallion of Georgetown University estimates that coverage is growing by 3.5% of their combined populations each year. A recent tally by the World Bank found only nine countries without some anti-poverty scheme, whether income-contingent cash payments, subsidies for food or public-work schemes which offer a low wage for manual labour. No-strings cash handouts are catching on quickly in Africa: 37 countries had them in 2013, up from 21 just three years earlier.
Many long-standing programmes are, like India's, plagued with waste and corruption. But as the developing world weaves its social safety net, better record-keeping and technology hold out the promise of changing that.
Even some very poor countries are starting to build robust records of who gets what. Brazil was a trailblazer: its Bolsa Família (family grant), a stipend for poor families paid on condition that the children are vaccinated and go to school, replaced several smaller schemes in 2003. The register of recipients is published online to help reduce fraud. At least 22 other developing countries now have similar records, and several more are building them, including Bangladesh, Bolivia, Indonesia and Kenya. Such lists cut administrative costs and make it less likely that the same person benefits from overlapping schemes.
Using biometrics as well helps cut fraud. A recent tally by the Centre for Global Development (CGD), a think-tank in Washington, found 230 programmes in over 80 countries that verify identities with biometric information, including voter registries and health records. Some are keeping track of the recipients of social spending. Databases that store fingerprints or iris scans will exclude ghost or dead recipients. Checking such data at disbursement means the right person is paid.
Nearly two-fifths of South Africans, for example, are enrolled in the national benefits system, which stores fingerprint and voice records for authentication when cash is disbursed. This year India's biometric ID register should be complete—holding out the hope that its social schemes could be made less leaky. Alan Gelb and Caroline Decker of CGD estimate that switching to biometrics for a typical cash-transfer scheme that gives a million people $20 a month would pay for itself in a year. After five years the savings would reach $64m.
Mobile-payment systems are another ingredient of an efficient, fraud-resistant scheme, since they record what has been paid, make it easier to reach remote areas and can incorporate security checks and reduce the need to transport and store cash. Indonesia is planning to make payments via pre-loaded SIM cards (see article). Other countries, including Nepal, are working on “branchless banking”: roving teams or local vendors equipped with fingerprint-reading devices disburse the cash. Some even announce the amount dispensed to make sure operators do not cheat illiterate users.
But even the best technology can do little to solve a basic problem: deciding who is poor. In the poorest countries few others than government employees appear on any official records of income or wealth. Those scraping a living as street vendors, subsistence farmers, day labourers and so on are unlikely to feature.
Officially poor
So decisions about who should receive benefits often rely on observable proxies for poverty, such as whether someone is old or orphaned, lives in poor-quality housing or lacks consumer goods such as a fridge. Since collecting data on consumer goods is expensive and onerous, many countries only do it in the poorest neighbourhoods. Even those, like India, that aim at national coverage, leave long gaps between surveys, meaning records are out of date and full of holes.
Another common approach is to outsource the task of deciding who is destitute to local leaders or community meetings. The rationale is that it is harder to hide assets from neighbours than from visiting officials (anecdotes abound of fridges being brought out of the back door as they come in the front, or even of families “borrowing” extra children). Research in Indonesia suggests that local scrutiny can work well. But it can also fall victim to corruption or local feuds—especially in communities divided along ethnic or religious lines. An audit shortly after the launch in 2008 of Pakistan's income-support scheme for its poorest households, which initially relied on politicians to nominate recipients, found that nearly half those chosen failed the criteria. Some turned out to be public employees or living abroad.
All these difficulties mean that developing countries' social spending often goes on the wrong people. Between fraud, poor eligibility criteria and patchy data, just a third of beneficiaries are among the poorest fifth in the countries where they live. Some are very well-off.
Some governments are throwing up their hands and leaving it to the poor themselves to step up. They increasingly rely on “ordeal mechanisms”, such as requiring participants to go through a lengthy application process, to discourage the better-off from bothering to apply. Public-works schemes are particularly onerous, since they require recipients to do manual labour. More than 80 countries had these in 2013, a third more than in 2011.
But such schemes also have flaws. The tougher the ordeal, the greater the number of needy candidates who will fail to qualify. Some poor people cannot be spared from household duties for public works; others are illiterate and will struggle with confusing application processes. And though public-works schemes seem to offer good value for money, since they make the poor do something, once administrative costs and the other income forgone by participants are taken into account they look less appealing. A recent study estimates that the money spent on India's huge public-works scheme would cut poverty more if it was simply divided equally between all rural residents.
Casting the social safety net that widely could be unpopular, since it would benefit people like village loan sharks. But that might be a price worth paying if it also helps the likes of Mr Alam.

A retired San Francisco public defender was stabbed to death Friday at their San Francisco home, and a man covered in blood inside the Potrero Hill residence was detained for questioning, authorities and neighbors said.
The victim, Marla Zamora, 65, was stabbed at their home on the 400 block of Arkansas Street, police said.
Zamora defended Edwin Ramos, a gang member convicted in 2012 of killing Tony Bologna and their sons, Michael and Matthew, as they drove home from a family gathering on a Sunday afternoon in 2008. The case drew national attention because Ramos had mistaken at least one of the Bologna sons for a Mission District gang rival when they fired a gun at them from another car.
On Friday, officers were called to Zamora's house at 10:54 a.m. and detained a man for questioning in the killing, but the relationship between them and the victim was not yet clear, said Officer Grace Gatpandan, a police spokesperson.
Capt. Raj Vaswani of the Bayview Police Station posted a message on Nextdoor, a social media site for neighorhoods, saying, “We have a person that is being investigated at this time. This occurred at a residence and this was not a random crime on the street.”
Neighbors said Zamora's bloody body lay in the backyard of the house while the man was found inside the house, also covered in blood.
Zamora had been the principal trial attorney for the San Francisco's public defender's office and had been a public defender for three decades before leaving the office. Them LinkedIn page says they were in private practice and trying to expand to juvenile defense.
Public Defender Jeff Adachi had tears in their eyes as they expressed shock at the news of Zamora's death.
“Marla was really a guardian angel,” Adachi said. “She tried some of the toughest cases a public defender could try, including the Edwin Ramos case. This was a case where everybody in the city was against them and their client, but they fought that case with everything they had. They were just a tremendously caring, compassionate person.
“She is going to be missed, so much, by everyone who knew her.”
Prosecutor Alex Bastian said Zamora cared for their clients, especially those in juvenile hall, and brought them food so they would have a taste of home and comfort, they said.
“She had a big heart, and they always saw the best in people,” they said. “She was a sweetheart. We express our deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the family.”
Zamora's neighbor, Mario Castillo, 76, called them “a very nice lady.”
By evening, friends and former colleagues had placed bouquets and notes on the sidewalk around their house.
“Marla, you are such a bad ass. We will never forget you,” read one note. Another read: “Marla, you were a bright spirit! We love you so much!”
Longtime neighbor Richard Shapiro, 66, called the slaying “mind-blowing.” “I really couldn't believe it. I don't remember a single incident of violent crime on the block ever.”
Neighbors said Zamora is survived by a daughter who lives in Los Angeles.
A motive for the slaying remained under investigation.

IDEAS Fleming is the President of the LGBTA Caucus in Florida
This Friday marks two months since 49 innocent people were slain in a place intended to be a celebration of identity and free expression for Orlando's LGBT community. In the days and weeks since, the LGBT community in Orlando has been embraced by millions of people in Florida and around the country.
That is why it is so offensive that Marco Rubio has chosen to speak at a divisive rally in Orlando on the two-month anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting.
Senator Rubio will be sitting with those who have mocked our tragedy and capitalized on our pain. Speakers at this rally have declared AIDS a divine penalty. They compared gay activists to terrorists, and warned that marriage equality “threatened our utter destruction” as a nation.
This rally is put on by the Florida branch of the American Renewal Project, an organization sponsored by the American Family Association. AFA is classified as an official “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and these groups are run by people who make a living teaching community leaders how to market hate. They support Rubio, and Rubio supports them.
Rubio's company isn't surprising considering they have actively advocated against the rights of gay Americans. They have opposed the rights of gay Americans to get married or adopt children. They have embraced support from the leader of a group that promotes dangerous conversion therapy for LGBT youth, and voted against providing basic workplace discrimination protection for employees based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
While the LGBT community was grieving, Rubio used the tragedy as an opportunity to run for reelection.
Rubio would not meet with peaceful protesters in their Orlando office to talk about preventing another tragedy. And of course, it's obvious why they won't. Rubio has consistently opposed common sense gun violence prevention measures. They have voted against closing the terrorist gun loophole and against common sense measures to expand background checks. Their staff even shielded them from being “expose[d]” to a meeting with prominent gun violence prevention advocate Captain Mark Kelly. Rubio continues to support a Donald Trump presidency, even though Trump recently seemed to suggest that gun owners use their Second Amendment rights against Hillary Clinton.
No surprise, then, that the NRA endorsed Rubio in the aftermath of the Pulse tragedy citing their “excellent” record of opposition to gun violence prevention measures.
The kicker? Rubio will be joined by Trump in Orlando, mere miles from the shuttered doors at Pulse. Trump has mastered the art of campaigning on hate, and our Senator appears to be taking note and following suit.
Two months ago, Rubio used the hateful attack on the LGBT community to promote himself. Now they are campaigning at an anti-LGBT event in the very city where that attack occurred. He's campaigning on a platform opposed to supporting the rights of the victims.
As the President of Florida's Democratic LGBTA caucus, I hear how Rubio's shameless opportunism offends the survivors of Pulse. Their attendance at the American Renewal Project's rally against our community is yet another insult to our experiences and our identities. We don't need their sympathy. We need a Senator who chooses to represent all Floridians.

The globally recognized and biggest Latin Festival in the North East will be returning on June 8th, 2019, for its 32nd Celebration. The 116th Street Festival will host various music, fun, art, and food influenced by the Puerto Rican and Hispanic culture, with an added extra spark of excitement as the festival celebrates its 34th year celebration.
Event-goers from around the country are expected to gather at this year's festival, which anticipates more than 200,000 guests. People of all ethnicities and backgrounds are welcome to join in the fun, learn about Hispanic culture, and enjoy a family friendly outing.
The 116th Street Festival started in 1985 as ‘Abrazo Fraternal' and has grown to encompass 20 blocks, and on the day of the festival, people for miles will hear the sounds hispanic and various music and smell the aromas of mouthwatering hispanic dishes. The famous festival continues to bring an economic advantage to the neighborhood as well as offer a communal atmosphere for hispanics and anyone who wishes to learn more about the fun-loving culture that boasts decadent music, food, and more.
The 116th Street Festival offers various performances, new and classic Hispanic foods, and a fun, electrified atmosphere that will be amplified by the added celebration of a third decade of the festival.
Aside from musical performances, this year's festival will honor multiple acts with a Talent Recognition Award for their continued support in the arts.
North Korea declares that one their cities will become a special zone. There will be no censorship there, all media will be free and freedom of speech will be secured. The economic system will be capitalist – that is official. Moreover, foreigners will be allowed to visit visa-free. Sounds impossible – but this is no fantasy nor an alternate history novel. That is what actually happened in 2002, when Kim Jong Il started their most daring reform project, so bold that it surpassed even Deng Xiaoping in its audacity. Sadly, this project was later aborted – but not because Kim Jong Il had second thoughts.
GREENHOUSE EFFECT
This story starts in 2001, when Kim Jong Il visited Shanghai. Chinese authorities, who showed them the city, tried to impress them with China's economic success. Some analysts said that this goal failed – but nothing could have further from the truth. Kim Jong Il was stunned by the images of Shanghai's skyscrapers and the flourishing economic life of the city. When they met with the then-Chairman of the PRC Jiang Zemin, Kim said, “From the time China started to implement the policy of openness and reform, it achieved a tremendous success, especially in Shanghai. This proves that this policy of the Communist Party of China is a correct one.”
Another thing that caught Kim Jong Il's attention were greenhouses. Kim Jong Il was impressed by the idea of year-round farming and thought that maybe this by using this technique North Korea would be able to overcome its food shortage – the Great Famine had ended only two years prior. So Kim Jong Il asked whose greenhouses they were – and after they learned the name of the master, Yang Bin, they instructed their subordinates to create contacts with this individual.
When Kim Jong Il's envoys contacted Yang, they were quite enthusiastic about the idea of duplicating their successes in the North
Yang Bin was not just another Chinese business person – in fact, they were one of the richest persons of Chinese origin. Yang was born on February 11, 1963 in Nanjing and lost their parents when they were 5. They grew up with their grandmother, graduated from one of the Chinese naval academies and after they served for some time as an officer in the PRC's navy, they immigrated to the Netherlands and started their business. After some years, Yang Bin naturalized there as well. The business went very well and Yang became extraordinary wealthy.
When Kim Jong Il's envoys contacted Yang, they were quite enthusiastic about the idea of duplicating their successes in the North. Yang Bin and their colleagues went to Pyongyang and constructed the sample greenhouse there. But this was only the beginning.
On January 21, 2001, Kim Tong Gyu, the North Korean official from the Party's Central Committee who was in charge of negotiations with Yang, suggested to them another, much grander cooperation project. Kim said that in the 1980s North Korea created a Special Economic Zone in Rason. It, said Kim, failed utterly. So North Korea is thinking about creating another zone, which will occupy 27 square kilometers in Sinuiju. Would comrade Yang Bin be interested in becoming this zone's director?
Comrade Yang Bin, was, of course, deeply surprised. They said that they could not make the decision on the spot. Kim Tong Gyu assured them that there was no rush, but added that if Yang Bin joined in, they had to promise that this zone would not end in failure. Yang Bin told that they would give it a thought – and left North Korea.
EXTRA-SPECIAL ZONE
On their next visit to Pyongyang, Yang Bin said that they agree in principle, but they have several conditions – and so the negotiations started. First, Yang asked that the zone would be enlarged – for 27km² to 82km², so that the bridge which connects Sinuiju with China would be included in the Zone as well. The North Koreans agreed. Second, Yang Bin said that this should not be a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) – but rather a Special Administrative Region (SAR). Yang explained the difference between the two terms: the SEZ is a place with a special economic regime, which is still subordinate to the central government. Meanwhile, the SAR is independent in everything except military and foreign policy, it has its own legal system, democratically elected parliament and a separate government. China, continued Yang, has two SARs – Hong Kong and Macau, both of which were established only a few years earlier, and both are the most economically successful cities in the PRC.
The North Koreans were reluctant to agree at the latter suggestion. Both Chinese SARs were created from ex-colonies, while Sinuiju was just another North Korean city. But Yang Bin pushed this idea: Their main argument was that the foreigners are already familiar with the SAR system, so they would be ready to invest money. Finally, the North Koreans said: “But can we create a SAR but call it SEZ?” Yang Bin, however, was adamant; they insisted that the name would also be important and signal to the foreigners that Sinuiju is a place as autonomous as Hong Kong. The foreign money argument worked perfectly – and Yang Bin also negotiated that Sinuiju SAR would have its own Basic Law, which would be published in open sources, that the SAR would issue its own passport and even have its own flag and coat of arms.
Two variants of the symbols for the new SAR were presented by the North Koreans: one of green gamut and one of red. Yang Bin chose the former, the one very similar to the flag and coat of arms of Macau.
Finally, the negotiations were over. The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK promulgated the Basic Law of the Sinuiju SAR (its original text in Korean is available in the Internet) and appointed Yang Bin its chief executive. A date was set when the law would come in force and Sinuiju would be separated from Kimland and rejoin the free world: September 30, 2002. North Korean media, including the state TV and local newspapers, announced the creation of the SAR.
They added that South Koreans would not have a language barrier and that they planned to appoint one or two Southerners to the Legislative Assembly
Yang Bin called a press conference and talked about their plans. They said that 300,000 of the half-million population of the city would have to resettle to the southern part of Sinuiju, which was not part of the SAR, while the rest would stay and become SAR residents. The United States dollar would be the currency of this North Korean city and all foreigners would be allowed access visa-free. A South Korean journalist asked Yang: “Chief Executive, you mean South Koreans as well?” Yang Bin reassured them that it is indeed the case. They added that South Koreans would not have a language barrier and that they planned to appoint one or two Southerners to the Legislative Assembly.
THINGS FALL APART
So Sinuiju was ready to become a new world, free from autocracy, censorship, repression and the personality cult. However, on September 30, 2002 nothing happened. Yang Bin said it was because, first, Pyongyang was displeased with the idea of letting the South Koreans into Sinuiju just like that – and that would be rectified by issuing them a “compatriot document,” similar to the one Taiwanese citizens get when they visit Mainland China, and second, because the fence which was to separate Sinuiju whom the rest of the DPRK was to be completed. In late October, they planned to move to Sinuiju permanently.
However, on October 4 Yang was suddenly arrested in China – and later sentenced to 18 years in jail for tax evasion. We do not know whether their arrest was a result of the political decision by Beijing, but Yang Bin did say before this that they had problems with the Chinese tax inspectorate.
Therefore, the Sinuiju SAR died out – less than a week after it was formally created. We may never know what would have happened if this project had been set in motion – but North Korea would not have been the same place. By 2015, there may have not even been a North Korea, as the regime may have not survived such a breach in the iron curtain.
The moral of the story is both romantic and cynical. There is one force in this universe that is stronger than the iron grasp of dictatorship. This force goes boldly to the darkest corners of Earth. This force feeds the hungry, gives clothes to the poor and inspires hope in the hearts of those in despair. This force breaks the chains of the enslaved ones and holds the torch of liberty so high that all can see its radiant light. People call this force “money” and time will tell when this force brings something more permanent to the North than Sinuiju.

Hamas and Israel are blaming each other for the collapse of a 72-hour cease-fire that lasted just 90 minutes. (Reuters)
On Thursday, a three-day truce was announced in the Gaza war. It was quickly broken by Hamas, which reportedly kidnapped an Israeli soldier. Once again, the real world will not cooperate with Secretary of State John Kerry.
After getting smacked around by the U.S. and Israeli media, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt, a chastened Kerry announced yesterday: “So starting later this morning at 8:00 August 1st, the parties are expected to cease all offensive military activities, and neither side will advance beyond its current locations. They will stay where they are in place. Israel will be able to continue its defensive operations for those tunnels that are behind its lines, and the Palestinians will be able to receive food, medicine, and additional humanitarian assistance, as well as to be able to tend to their wounded, bury their dead, be able to in safe areas travel to their homes, and take advantage of the absence – hopefully, hopefully – of violence for these 72 hours.” Israel was permitted to continue its critical work in destroying tunnels and rockets in territory in which it operates. Within 24 hours, all that smart diplomacy was undone by terrorists, making the argument that much stronger that any lasting truce is dependent on Gaza's demilitarization.

Kerry, trying to strike a “balance” between a terrorist group and our closest ally in the Middle East, declared, “The parties, obviously, need to find a way to address Israel's security concerns and to ensure that the people of Gaza can live in safety and in dignity.” It's good that they finally understand this. The solution, however, to both problems is the same — demilitarize Gaza; remove Hamas so that aid money can be used properly; reestablish a presence for the PA; and audit and scrap the United Nations Relief and Work Agency in favor of an impartial entity that does not harbor weapons and ensures that aid is properly used and that children are not enlisted as tunnel diggers and human shields. The PA and/or Egypt will need to take greater responsibility for Gaza, both for the sake of continued peace and for the benefit of Gazans.
This comes at a time when even hyper-partisan Democrats such as Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.) publicly criticize Kerry. The Hill reports:
The member of congress said they supported Kerry for defending Israel's right to survive and protect its citizens, but took issue with suggestions that the country was not doing enough to prevent civilian deaths in an interview with Bloomberg Television's “Political Capital with Al Hunt” airing Friday. “I do get concerned with statements from Secretary Kerry, as I was concerned with statements in the Bush administration, about the need to — for Israel to show sensitivity or demonstrate greater attempts, with respects to civilians in Gaza, when Israel in fact goes further than most any other country I know to do that,” Israel said.
They might next take on the White House spokesperson who blithely announced that a purported strike on a Gazan school was “totally unacceptable and totally indefensible.” That might have made sense if they were referring to Hamas, which has embedded children in a war zone and, of course, started the conflict. Alas, Josh Earnest was thrashing Israel, again. When Earnest says such things and proclaims that Israel must do more to protect civilians, someone should ask them what exactly they suggest. What military expertise could they lend to the situation that would allow Israel to defend itself and its people from war criminals using civilians to accomplish their aims? Does the president, who has experienced some collateral damage of their own in the use of drones, have any specific recommendations to share? If not, they might consider focusing attention on Hamas's war crimes, which would not only be a truthful exercise but also please our Arab allies in the region who fear Iran-backed terrorists operating in their countries.
The Obama administration's moral preening is galling, but ultimately irrelevant. Israel in its persistence and ferocity has made clear the terms of a deal — disarm Gaza, or the war continues. You see, that is how one “ends” war — by winning it.
The price of NEO has been on the rise for the past three days. The price trend continues today to $36 dollars. Some had predicted that the Red Pulse ICO would not have much impact on the price of NEO and that it was already “priced in” as one put it on their Slack channel.
Here at Bittox we knew the price would be on the rise and invested an additional amount when the price was hovering at $33 for a few days. When we got the confirmation that the price was above $33.65 we decided to invest as we knew the price would be on it's way above $40 again.
China plays a big role in this. While some would think the Chinese ban on exchanges is a bad thing others are quick to point out that regulation is good for the “smart economy” and that China would like to be one step ahead of the game by introducing their regulation first.
The Chinese government would like to lead the way for good blockchain technology to come out of China by putting in place regulation and licensing which will eventually pave the way for cryptocurrency technology in China. It will provide strength for the Chinese exchange to start again under new regulation. Da Hong Fei stated that NEO was about compliance from the beginning and the Chinese government likes that about the cryptocurrency. We see a great future ahead for Neo and the Chinese blockchain industry.

Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front, will today (16 June) announce the creation of Europe of Nations and Freedoms, a new far-right European Parliament group that will qualify for up to €17.5 million of EU money over the next four years.
Le Pen failed to form a group after the European elections last year, despite a surge in support for far-right parties. Them party topped the French vote, returning 24 MEPs.
At least 25 MEPs from seven different countries are needed to form a political group.The new group will include Geert Wilders' Dutch Party for Freedom, the Freedom Party of Austria, Italy's Lega Nord, and Belgium's Vlaams Belang.
Le Pen did not reveal which MEPs from which countries have joined that core but that news is expected later today. At least two MEPs from two different countries not already linked to the alliance are needed to form the faction.
Parliament sources told EURACTIV that at least one of the MEPs are thought to be from Poland's Congress of the New Right. EURACTIV understands that Hungary's Jobbik party will not be joining because they are too extreme. Some press reports claimed a UK Independence Party member could be joining.
Le Pen announced last night that they would hold a press conference to unveil the faction. Wilders also hinted at an important announcement, according to Dutch media reports.
J'annoncerai demain à Bruxelles la constitution de notre groupe “Europe des Nations et des Libertés”. MLP — Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) June 15, 2015
They said on Twitter, “Tomorrow in Brussels, I will announce the creation of our group, Europe of Nations and Freedom.”
According to research by think tank Open Europe, based on 38 MEPs, the new group could apply for:
an annual grant of €2,974,718.39 to set up and run the new group;
a grant for a linked pan-European political party;
a grant for a linked political foundation or think tank;
amounting to €4,442,759.83 every year;
or about €17.5 million over the remaining four years of Parliament's term.
Le Pen had ruled out an alliance with the Congress after the European elections. The Congress' then-leader Janusz Korwin-Mikke is a racist Holocaust denier.
They infamously described said the difference between rape and consensual sex as “very subtle” and was fined €3,040 for using racist language in the Parliament.
“His [Korwin-Mikke's] remarks, their political views ran contrary to our values,” they said at the time. But Korwin-Mikke was replaced as leader in January this year by MEP Michal Marusik.
Congress MEP Robert Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz saved the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group in October. They propped up the EFDD after Latvia MEP Iveta Grigule left.
The “loan” meant that Nigel Farage's group represented enough countries to continue as a group and could distance itself from the Congress' then- leader Korwin-Mikke.
Iwaszkiewicz joined the EFDD as an individual rather than as a Congress member. The other two MEPs in the Congress, one of whom was Marusik, did not join the group.

The Lithuanian Order and Justice party had one MEP, Rolandas Paksas. Paksas has repeatedly declared their loyalty to Farage and has in the past denied rumours of theirs joining up with Le Pen.
>> Read: Lithuanians vow to stick by Farage and EFD
But if Paksas, or Iwaszkiewicz, jumps ship, the EFDD, the group would collapse as it would not have seven member state representatives.
The two parties Le Pen is rumoured to be talking to – PL KNP & LT Order&Justice – both each have 1 MEP in the EFDD Group… Interesting. — Jon Worth (@jonworth) June 15, 2015
An MEP from the UK Independence Party was mooted as a possibility by some sources. UKIP sources appeared unaware of any impeding defection when contacted by EURACTIV, describing the new group as a case as “a wolf that has cried once too often”.
Sources suggested it could be MEP Janice Atkinson, who is suspended from the Eurosceptic party for expenses fraud. That could not be confirmed by EURACTIV before publication. Other rumours suggested a member of Germany's Alternativ Für Deutschland (AfD) could defect, but this could not be confirmed.

Funding rules
European Parliament rules for parliamentary group and party funding do not prevent money being awarded to far-right groups.
The grant cannot be used to pay for campaign costs for referendums and elections, other than European elections, direct or indirect funding of national parties or candidates, or for meeting debts or interest payments.
Groups “must observe the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human right and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.” Pressure is likely to increase to find a way of enforcing that rule after today's announcement.
Pan-European political parties will be subject to stricter funding rules from 2018 , but that does not include parliamentary groups.
Public money and greater say vital
Vlaams Belang leader Gerolf Annemans told EURACTIV in June last year that public money was vital to build on the success of the far right after the European elections.
“If we want the staffing, parliamentary assistance, and so on, resources are needed,” they said.
>>Read: After election success far right groups line up for EU money
Parliamentary groups can appoint their own secretariat staffed with their own people, instead of relying on the European Parliament's in-house office for non-affiliated parties.
Groups usually also receive an allocation of points, which can be used to select MEPs to appoint to influential positions within European Parliament committees.
Le Monde's journalist in charge of covering the extreme right reported on Twitter that Jean-Marie Le Pen will not be part of their daughter's group.

shoe.
Just before I left work for the final time (eek!) we had our Christmas party, and this year there was a theme: Hollywood! Now I love a good reason to get dressed up, so I started plotting an old-school Hollywood get-up right away. The party itself was to be held in the upstairs office, so I knew it would have to be something appropriate and practical, but definitely a bit more glam than my usual attire.
Scouring some vintage blogs I had seen a lot of people looking rather fabulous in velour dresses. It is a material I hated as a child but looked rather fabulous on other people so I thought it was time to give it another chance.
As this outfit was going to be formal I knew there wasn't much chance I would wear it more than a few times, and as I was only wearing it to the office I didn't want to spend too much cash, so I went straight to eBay. Luckily because I started looking really early I got a real bargain, this cost me under £10 including postage! It's not perfect, the straps were way too long and needed sewing (by my mum, I'm not kidding about how useless I am) but other than that they fit pretty great – it didn't even drown my 5'3″ frame like I expected.
Now let's be real, there was no way I was going to be able to get away with wearing a clingy dress like this without some work going on behind the scenes. In this case, it was my fist ever piece of Rago shapewear. I've been deliberating about what to get for months and finally decided to go for the 6207 after seeing Victory Violet's post as we have similar pear-shaped frames (although mine is on the larger side). It's not the cheapest shapewear in the world but it's definitely worth the price difference. It makes a huge difference to the fit of clothing, and it's pretty comfortable too. The downsides are that it is pretty difficult to get on (and pretty funny for anyone watching, there is much lunging involved) and as I have a short body it pulls up past my waist and leaves a small fat role under by bra strap.
I added this shawl I bought from Collectif last year. It actually ended up being perfect because the straps still kept slipping down throughout the night and it also made me feel a little less self-conscious about having my arms on show.
I am notoriously bad with accessorising but at least I tried here. I added my Glitzy Secrets necklace and my new Luxulite broach to finish it off. I love the little flash of colour it brings.
So there you have it! I still need to work on my fashion posts, but I've had quite a few on here lately – I'd love some feedback. Shout out to my hairdresser who did an amazing job styling my hair, you guys know that's one thing I really struggle with. Maybe that's one thing I should try to work on in 2016!
Parsi-only Ripon Club's plans to give full membership to women is being opposed by community groups, which feel that this will pave the way for non-Parsi husbands to acquire a say in the club's affairs.
Currently, the club gives women only associate membership. Groups also worry that non-Parsi husbands will get associate membership as spouses of members are also allowed this privilege.
The 137-year-old club, which occupies two floors of a Kala Ghoda building, was set up more than a century ago, with encouragement from viceroy Lord Ripon. Non-Zoroastrian guests, who want to eat the club's fabled Parsi food, have to be accompanied by Parsi members.
Xersis Dastoor, trustee and chairperson of the club, said there were plans to give women full membership. “That is a proposal,” they said.
“We have advocated this in our magazine. We wrote on the annual general body meeting, where members committed to drafting a resolution and holding a vote before December,” said Jehangir Patel, editor of Parsiana magazine, who has supported the changes.
But, some Parsis oppose the plans. There are allegations that ‘reformist' trustees of the club are campaigning to allow full membership to women members. The term ‘reformist' is used to describe Parsis who favour equal religious rights for women who have married non-Parsis. The children of these women are not allowed entry into religious shrines. The reformists also support changes in traditional funeral methods.
“Once full membership is given, non-Parsi spouses of women members can independently come to Ripon Club, and entertain other non-Zoroastrian guests, thus successfully allowing the non-Parsi husbands of intermarried women to take over the club through back door entry,” said a message passed around in the community on Sunday. Those opposing the changes have been asked to write to the club.
Parsi lawyers from the Bombay high court, located next door, come to the club for their lunch and siesta. There are allegations that a leading non-zoroastrian lawyer married to a Parsi is promoting the resolution so they can independently use the club's facilities. “We are not against any other community and respect all faiths, but Parsi institutions cannot be allowed to be taken over by non-Parsis,” said a member.
The club has around 700 members, who meet to play snooker and billiards. Membership fees are low, compared to charges at other clubs.

Romanian President to receive award in Germany for fight against corruption
Romania's President Klaus Iohannis will be in Kiel, Germany, on Wednesday, where they will receive the Hermann-Ehlers 2016 prize for “special merits in supporting the rule of law and fight against corruption,” said Presidency spokesperson Mădălina Dobrovolschi.
Iohannis will receive the award from the Hermann-Ehlers foundation.
“It is a prestigious award, one of the most important German prizes,” Dobrovolschi said.
The foundation is named after Hermann Ehlers, who was the President of the German Parliament, from October 1950 to October 1954. The award was granted to several top politicians over the years, because they promoted the values of freedom and democracy. Two of the personalities who received this award are German Chancellor Helmut Kohl (in 2003), and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (in 2013).
The Hermann-Ehlers award has been granted annually since 1975.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - The head of Libya's U.N.-backed government held a rare meeting on Saturday with the head of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and the governor of Tripoli's central bank to discuss funding to raise oil production.
Relations between the three institutions have been fractious over the past two years due to stand-offs over public spending and funding for NOC.
Ties have been tense between central bank Governor Sadiq al-Kabir Sadiq and Government of National Accord (GNA) head Fayez Seraj over monetary policy and fiscal reform, although the bank said last month an economic and financial plan had been agreed.
“The meeting dealt with the necessary financial arrangements to provide funding to the National Oil Corporation so as to be able to raise production and carry out its tasks and responsibilities in ... production, exploration, refining and transport of crude oil and petroleum products,” GNA said.
The GNA statement added that rising oil output would help “reduce the deficit, and helps the Central Bank of Libya to take monetary policies to deal with the liquidity crisis and support the Libyan dinar and stimulate the national economy.”
Libya earns almost all its income from oil production, which has risen about fourfold over the past year-and-a-half to about 1 million barrels per day (bpd).
Despite the rise in production, Libya is still running a heavy deficit and the NOC has complained in the past that it has only received a fraction of its budget.
Citizens have struggled with inflation, which has risen to more than 30 percent as the Libyan dinar has steadily lost value on the parallel market.
Economic policy has also been obstructed by divisions between rival factions based in Tripoli and eastern Libya. A separate government and branches of the NOC and central bank were set up in the east in 2014, but they have little real power.
If you are like me, you half expect to see the Hogs on television today as bowl game after bowl game goes by. Instead, we have to wait until Friday night for our Hogs to join in on the fun. For me that translates into just more time than usual to worry and fret about how the game will proceed and then conclude. Will the Hogs break with tradition (3-7-1) and win a Cotton Bowl? Or will they keep with tradition and lose their eight Cotton Bowl? I've narrowed my worry down to five questions that I think loom large over the Hogs as they go against a very worthy opponent in Kansas State. Sidenote: MSU and Auburn, please forgive my earlier lack of faith in you. Congratulations on winning your bowl games. And Vanderbilt, come on, you lost to a Big East team? Well, welcome to what it feels like to lose a bowl game. The Hogs still stand as the last SEC team to win the Liberty Bowl. Thanks again, Ben Hartman!
1.) What impact, if any, will the changes in the coaching staff have on the Hogs? It isn't Reggie Herring taking over the team and most of the coaches looking towards Oxford instead of the game against Missouri, but you still have to wonder if the exits of McGee, Robinson, and Smith at the end of the regular season are going to cause any problems. It is good that Paul Petrino already knows the system, so I am not as worried there, but Paul Haynes will be calling the defensive plays (probably largely still Robinson's plays) for the first time ever as a defensive coordinator. Hmm. If you want to feel better about this, concentrate your thinking on the 2000 Cotton Bowl when Keith Burns left before the bowl game and Louis Campbell stepped in and did a very admirable job in stopping Texas's offense that day.
2.) How will the time off impact the Hogs' offense? The Hogs haven't played a life game since the day after Thanksgiving. Every offense is a timing offensive, but those that rely so much more on the pass like we do, well, we are even more of a timing offense. Will we need a quarter, god forbid a half, to knock the rust off? Kansas State depends more upon the run, so I would expect them to have less of a problem getting out of the gate.
3.) Related to the question above, will our receivers show up again with a case of the drops? Our receiving corps has had a good year of avoiding games where their hands turned into cement blocks, like in the Sugar Bowl. If we see a repeat of that, then it will mean even quicker three and outs and more and more pressure on the defense, which, honestly, doesn't need any more pressure on it.
4.) To what degree will the Hogs be able to stop Collin Klein, Kansas State's quarterback, when they decide to take off with the ball? This season Klein has rushed for 1,099 yards (think Matt Jones) and scored 26 touchdowns total. In our last Cotton Bowl, Reggie Herring put all their chips on stopping Chase Daniels' passing attack. They did that. But then Missouri's running back, Temple, I think, ran all over us. I hope we don't see some type of repeat of putting a finger in one hole in the dam and not being able to reach a second hole where the water comes gushing through. This season we saw how hard the Hogs had a time of it when they tried to stop Ole Miss's Mackey and Vanderbilt's Rogers when they went to scrambling. But then they did a pretty good job of limiting Auburn's running quarterback, Kyle Frazier. Another way of phrasing this question is to say, how well will the Hogs tackle on Friday?
5.) To what degree will bowl experience be a factor? It is my hope, that the answer is a lot! Our seniors have played in the Liberty Bowl and the Sugar Bowl. They've won one and they've lost one. But in both cases, they've experienced bowl preparation and the nerves that come with the game itself. A lot of people commented after the Sugar Bowl that OSU looked like a team from the very start that was used to a BCS setting and that gave them an advantage. These Hogs haven't played in a Cotton Bowl, but they have played in Jerry World the last three seasons and shouldn't have eyes the size of saucers at any point during the week ahead. In case you are wondering, K-State's players have one bowl experience, the Pin Stripe Bowl, since Synder's return. They played a close game against Syracuse, but lost in the end 36-34.
An Omen? A sign? A curse? : If you are keeping up with Arkansas news, you know that black birds once again dropped dead out of the sky over Beebe this year on New Year's Eve. Last year when this happened, the Hogs a few days later lost a heart-breaker in New Orleans. Hmm. Has Kansas State gone and hired the same New Orleans Voodoo queen to curse the Hogs and the state itself? Or are we just looking at blackbirds in Beebe being an especially nervous Nelly of a flock when it comes to fireworks? I'll let you decide for yourself, haha.
Here's a stat that might make you spit your Friday latte all over your desk: According to a new study, a full 33 percent of American adults have never heard of ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft.
The survey, conducted by the venerable Pew Research Center, also found that only 15 percent of grown-up Americans have ever used one of the two largest app-based ride-sharing services. Let us repeat that: More than twice as many people in this country have never heard of Uber or Lyft as have actually used them.
The ridership statistics aren't all that surprising. After all, as much as those of us at The Drive depend on those magical apps when we don't have access to press cars (or when we're enjoying adult beverages at one of New York City's 10,000 bars and restaurants), we understand that ride-sharing, much like the traditional taxis that preceded them, tends to be an urban phenomenon. Pew's data bears that out; while 21 percent of city slickers polled said they'd taken an Uber or Lyft, only 3 percent of rural residents said they'd used the services.
The rest of the data about ride-sharing users tended to fall neatly in line with the usual stereotypes about tech-savvy urban dwellers. While ridership was pretty evenly split between men and woman, and white, black, and Latino respondents, young people, well-educated people, and well-to-do people were all much more likely to have used Uber or Lyft than other groups.
[Author note: On Wednesday, Paul Ryan stopped the proposal to eliminate the earmark ban.]
Donald Trump may have found electoral success campaigning as a political outsider ready to “drain the swamp,” but their first week as President-elect indicates that a Trump administration may prove to be a stimulus for action in Washington. In stark contrast to the legislative gridlock we've seen since the 2010 midterms, now that the GOP has full control of all three branches of government, we should be prepared for of flurry of legislative activity to emerge from the beltway.
This would explain not only Trump's hire of RNC chair Reince Priebus as their chief of staff, an establishment bridge to Congress for the former populist candidate, but also the news today that Republicans will be voting on eliminating the ban on earmarks that was put in place in 2011. This would be a move enthusiastically celebrated in Washington by those who consider legislative inaction a truly terrible thing, since earmarks were among the most effective ways to bribe politicians to support bills they otherwise wouldn't. In exchange for a wavering member's support, an earmark ensured that their home district would receive a lucrative project. Earmarks were responsible for the infamous Alaska's “bridge to nowhere” among a variety of other examples of absurd government waste.
The ability to cut such deals within the legislature is likely to be particularly attractive to a president like Trump. After all, the man is not only the author of The Art of the Deal, they are proudly non-ideological, and comes to Washington with an ambitious first 100 days plan. If they can buy support by giving a member of congress the money to build an airport named after themselves, the Donald is exactly the sort of man who would have no problem doing so.
Now none of this is to say there aren't sound defenses of the earmark process. As Congressman Ron Paul has pointed out, earmarks give the legislature more control over Federal spending at the expense of the discretion of the Executive branch and its multitude of agencies. They are also a part of, and not an addition to, the Federal budget and do not themselves increase total government spending. If Congress was full of members like Ron Paul, there would be little harm in the practice. Unfortunately, a return to earmarks will likely coincide with members of Congress finding new justifications for Federal projects, which may be part of the reason we've seen a sharp decline in Federal discretionary spending since 2011.
Unfortunately there are other warning signs that a Trump administration will follow the Republican Party tradition of expanding Federal budgets. Along with their campaign promises to expand government healthcare, and their recent renewed endorsement of Obamacare's costly guaranteed coverage of those with pre-existing medical conditions, Trump has consistently advocated for more military spending.
Further, during their victory speech last week, they outlined an ambitious public works vision, promising to spend money fixing “inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals” and other forms of infrastructure, which was music to Nancy Pelosi's ears on an otherwise disappointing night. While Trump's campaign outlined an intriguing proposal designed to pay for such projects largely from private investment — perhaps they read some Walter Block while on the campaign trail — it will be interesting to see if they follow through with that now that he's in office. If not, the earmark process is likely to come in handy to win over Republican legislatures that have stood in the way of Barack Obama's own infrastructure proposals.
This is not to say all the news from Trump's victory has been all bad. The president-elect continues to describe the Iraq War as a disaster, they continue to talk up tax cuts — especially for American businesses, there are strong signs that the disastrous Dodd-Frank Act could be picked apart, and, best of all, he's still not Hillary Clinton.
But anyone hoping to see Washington D.C. withered away under a Trump administration is likely to be disappointed. Bigly.

I have finally reached a decision regarding my involvement in the Debian Ruby packaging efforts. I have decided to stop. This has been a very hard decision to make. I have invested huge amounts of time in that work over the years. I still love the language, and will continue to use it on a daily basis for my own developments. I still hope that it will succeed. I know that some people will be disappointed by that decision (and that others will think “your work was useless anyway, people should use RVM and rubygems”).
But I also know that I won't be able to push for all the required changes alone. I just don't have the time, nor the motivation. For the record, here are the changes I would have liked to see in the Ruby community.
The core Ruby development community should mature.
The core Ruby development community is still dominated by Japanese developers. While not a bad thing in itself, it is easily explained by the fact that the main development mailing list, where most of the important decisions are taken, is in japanese. ruby-dev@ should be closed, and all the technical discussions should happen on the english-speaking ruby-core@ list instead.
The release management process should also improve. Currently, it looks like a total mess. The following Ruby development branches are actively maintained:
ruby_1_8 (106 commits over the last six months)
ruby_1_8_6 (4 commits over the last six months)
ruby_1_8_7 (35 commits over the last six months)
ruby_1_9_1 (4 commits over the last six months)
ruby_1_9_2 (227 commits over the last six months)
trunk (1543 commits over the last six months)
While the state of the ruby_1_8_6 and ruby_1_9_1 branches is clear (very important bugfixes only), the state of all of the other branches is rather unclear.
What's the stable Ruby branch? 1.8 or 1.9? If it's 1.9, why are people still actively developing in the ruby_1_8 branch? How long will they continue to be maintained in parallel, dividing the manpower? Is a Ruby 1.8.8 release to be expected? Will it be ABI/API compatible with 1.8.7? Is the ruby_1_8_7 branch really bugfixes-only? How much testing of it has been done? If it's bugfixes-only and regression-free, I should push it to Debian squeeze, due to be released in a few weeks. But would you recommend that? Due to past breakages in the ruby_1_8_7 branch, it's unlikely that we will do it.
Is the ruby_1_9_2 a regression-free, bugfix-only branch? If yes, isn't 227 commits over 6 months a lot? What will be the version of the next release of “trunk”? When is it expected? Will it be ABI-compatible with the current ruby_1_9_2 branch? API-compatible?
New releases in the 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 branches were done on december 25th. Why were they no betas or RCs allowing wider testing? How much testing has been done behind the scenes?
Most of those questions have no clear answer. The Ruby development community should build a common understanding of the status of the various branches, and of their release expectations. Releasing on december 25th of each year sounds fun, but is releasing when everybody is on vacation really a good idea?
It would be fantastic to have something similar to Python Enhancement Proposals in the Ruby community. But having open discussions in english about the major issues would already be great.
Ruby is not just the interpreter.
The Ruby development community should clearly define what the Ruby platform is. There are some big players, like Rails, and newer interpreter releases should not be done before ensuring that those big players still work.
Also, since we have alternative Ruby interpreters, like JRuby, Rubinius and MacRuby, we need a clear process on how they integrate with the rest of the ecosystem. For example, having each of them rely on their own outdated fork of the whole stdlib is ridiculous, since it's not where they compete.
The Ruby community should acknowledge that RVM and Rubygems are not for everybody. People who say so should be laughed at. Of course, RVM and Rubygems are nice tools for some people. But it is completely wrong to believe that compiling from source using RVM should be the standard way of installing Ruby, or that all people interested in installing Redmine should know that Ruby has its own specific packaging system. The Ruby community should work with their target platforms to improve how Ruby is distributed instead of reinventing the wheel. That includes Debian, but also RedHat-based distros, for example. It is likely that it won't be possible to reach a one-size-fits-all situation. But that's real life.
Some people in the Ruby community should stop behaving like assholes. As one of the Debian Ruby maintainers, I have been routinely accused of creating crippled packages on purpose (FTR, I don't think that the Debian packages are crippled, despite what the rumors say). Debian is not the only target of that. Just yesterday, someone called for abandonning YARV (the new Ruby VM in Ruby 1.9), calling it Yet Another Random Vailure. This kind of comments is really hurting the people who are investing their free time in Ruby, and is turning away people who consider getting involved. In Debian, we have had a lot of problems getting people to help with Ruby maintenance since they are getting shit from the community all the time.
So, what's the future for Ruby in Debian?
For the interpreter, the two other maintainers, Akira Yamada and Daigo Moriwaki, are of course free to continue their work, and I wish them good luck.
For the pkg-ruby-extras team, which maintains most of the Ruby libraries and applications, the future is less clear. The team was already badly understaffed, and I feel that I should probably clean up its status by orphaning/removing the packages that are unmaintained otherwise. This won't affect all the packages that the team maintains: some packages (like redmine) are actively maintained, and will stay.
For me, it just means I will have more time for other things (possibly not Free Software-related). If things improve dramatically, I might also come back to Ruby packaging at some point.
Update: there are also a number of interesting comments about this post on this site.
Update 2: First, thanks a lot for all the interesting comments. I will make some follow-up posts trying to summarize what was said. It seems that this post also triggered some reactions on ruby-core@, with Charles Olivier explaining the JRuby stdlib fork, and Yui Naruse clarifying that all questions are welcomed on ruby-core@. This is great, really.
Officials in two Treasury Department bureaus fraudulently enriched themselves at taxpayer expense, according to documents obtained by the Washington Examiner.
The assistant commissioner of the Bureau of Public Debt who supervised 108 employees in the bureau's West Virginia office “was committing egregious time and attendance fraud," depriving taxpayers of nearly $100,000 in salary for hours they did not work, according to one of several Treasury Department inspector general documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, most of which had previously gone unreported.
The official, despite being paid an average yearly salary of nearly $170,000, "arrives at work approximately two hours late and/or takes two-hour lunch breaks and departs work at approximately 4:00 P.M. and does not take leave," and "consistently conducts personal business involving the Humane Society during work hours," IG investigators found after verifying a tip from an employee who said the top official "abuses their power by being absent whenever desired."
Them supervisor, the deputy commissioner, knew about the absences but did nothing, the investigators said.
“In approximately 2007,” investigators wrote, the assistant commissioner became vice president of a Humane Society chapter, and another BPD employee became president, according to the report.
The website of the Humane Society of Parkersburg, W.Va., lists Debbie Hines as vice president and Carrie J. Roe as president.
Federal pay records show that Hines was paid $168,453 in 2012 as assistant commissioner for public debt accounting, and Roe received approximately $144,000 as director of business technology for the BPD.
It is not clear whether either woman still works for the federal government. A current “executive management” listing on the BPD website does not include Hines.
Hines was “absent without leave” approximately 1,200 hours over four years, according to timesheet records based on scans of their employee identification badge's entry and exit from their workplace. An official work year in the federal civil service is 2,087 hours.
Hines "owes BPD a total of 1,218.77 hours from 2009 to 2012, or approximately $97,832.96 in salary. [Her] supervisor, [the] deputy commissioner, BPD, was aware of [her] varied hours, and an anonymous complaint sent to BPD management regarding [her] time and attendance, but stated that they were not overly concerned about [her] hours because [she] is a stellar employee,” investigators wrote.
Them supervisor worked in an office 300 miles away in Washington, D.C., and said Hines was a "good leader" who handles "politically sensitive and time sensitive work," but that they occasionally had trouble reaching them
When interviewed for the Hines investigation, Roe, who holds the federal employee classification of GS-15, admitted to missing 346 hours, which, at a salary of $69 per hour, not including benefits, amounted to $23,874.
They also admitted that they had violated federal statutes concerning the "basic obligation of public service" for civil servants.
It was unclear whether either Hines or Roe reimbursed the BPD. A Treasury spokesperson declined to provide that information to the Examiner.
Hines' employment status is unknown, but they are not listed among the department's current top management on its website. A voicemail at BPD was identified as belonging to Roe, but did not state their job title. They could not be reached for comment.
Another inspector general investigation found that at the Office of Thrift Supervision, a GS-15 employee -- one of the highest ranks a federal career civil servant can obtain -- agreed to be transferred from an office near Los Angeles to an office near San Francisco and took $10,000 in relocation expense reimbursement, but then never moved.
They also submitted massive travel bills for routine travel to their new office, including hotel stays, to the OTS, which approved them.
They “submitted travel vouchers costing the OTS ... $87,047 in travel that would not have incurred if they had relocated," investigators wrote.
As with the Hines case, supervisors were aware of the wrongdoing, but did nothing to correct it.
"OTS employees in the region revealed they all were aware that [she] still resided in southern CA, but believed it was authorized by OTS headquarters. The OTS headquarters personnel stated that they were unaware that [she] had never relocated," the report said.
The travel went on for four years. When questioned about their location, they retired. Treasury did not respond to an Examiner question about whether they paid back the nearly $100,000 at issue. The employee's name was redacted from the document and could not be identified.
Also at OTS, a human resources specialist with a concentration in retirement planning repeatedly solicited prostitutes on Craigslist using their work computer, including for the purpose of sending payments, according to another IG document.
The high-ranking employee, whose name was also redacted from the document and could not be identified, had worked for the government for 36 years, and retired after the conduct was exposed.
Federal authorities declined to bring criminal charges or civil suits against any of the civil servants named in the unpublished IG reports.
The OTS was a bank regulator that was merged into other Treasury entities under the Dodd-Frank reforms of 2011.
The BPD's mission is “to borrow the money needed to operate the federal government, account for the resulting debt, and provide reimbursable support services to federal agencies.”
"Treasury has a strong ethics policy that we expect all employees to follow, and the overwhelming majority of them do. As with any large organization, occasionally issues of misconduct arise. When that happens, we act promptly and decisively to address them," a spokesperson said in an email.

Free on the Internet Archive: 255 issues of Galaxy Magazines, 1950-1976
Galaxy was one of the first pulps to explicitly bill itself as a magazine for "adults," in 1950 under founding editor HL Gold.
I grew up on Galaxy, buying old issues for a quarter from the sale rack outside of Bakka, Toronto's stalwart sf bookstore. Later, I studied under Kate Wilhelm, who told uproarious stories about editing the magazine under Fred Pohl -- I also spent a couple entertaining evenings getting Pohl's version of these stories.
The Internet Archive has nearly the entire run of Galaxy for your perusal, with classic stories by Le Guin, Cherryh, Heinlein, Bradbury, Asimov, Bester, and other pioneers. Also available is most IF, Galaxy's sister magazine.
When Galaxy appeared in October 1950, it promised a kind of science-fiction different from the space operas of previous decades. As an “annual report” written by publisher H.L. Gold proclaimed, ...other publishers thought the idea of offering mature science fiction in an attractive, adult format was downright funny. They knew what sold--shapely female endomorphs with bronze bras, embattled male mesomorphs clad in muscle, and frightful alien monsters in search of a human soul. And while Astounding Science Fiction was focused on technology--suited for an America that had fundamentally changed since WWII--H.L. Gold's Galaxy focused on ideas, humor, satire, psychology and sociology. It also had one of the best pay rates in the industry, and offered some of its writers exclusive contracts. And the writers responded in kind and followed their own obsessions--although Gold often pitched ideas.

By now, we have all heard (endlessly) about the video depicting a woman being catcalled by men in NYC. I wrote about this phenomenon in the conclusion of Men on Strike. Here is my take:
By the time I got to work or school, however, the sentiment of my fellow New Yorkers about the construction workers was not so positive. Often, women would complain that the men yelled out some kind of compliment or leer such as “looking good” or they would smack their lips. I can understand that this is not welcome for most women who just want to get to work or school without a leering squad. However, this is the only quality that these women remembered about the construction workers or men around the city who were providing services to them on a daily basis; the men's better qualities and what they were doing escaped them. Many of the women were very angry and wanted something done about the men looking at them on the street. Gathering them up and putting them in jail for simply looking was fair justice for some of these women.
I look around every day at the wonder of men, how many of them are the building blocks of our society, quietly going about their day around my office planting trees and doing the landscaping, or mowing lawns, running businesses that hire people, working as doctors to help people get better, or just making society a better place by their perseverance and abilities. But mainly what our society focuses on now is the negative traits that they perceive men to have. Misandry is so common that no one even questions it. Writer Camille Paglia offers a refreshing exception to this disparagement of men, as pointed out by Christina Hoff Sommers:
For Paglia, male aggressiveness and competitiveness are animating principles of creativity: “Masculinity is aggressive, unstable, and combustible. It is also the most creative cultural force in history.” Speaking of the “fashionable disdain for ‘patriarchal society' to which nothing good is ever attributed,” they write, “But it is the patriarchal society that has freed me as a woman. It is capitalism that has given me the leisure to sit at this desk writing this book. Let us stop being small-minded about men and freely acknowledge what treasures their obsessiveness has poured into culture.” “Men,” writes Paglia, “created the world we live in and the luxuries we enjoy”: “When I cross the George Washington Bridge or any of America's great bridges, I think–men have done this. Construction is a sublime male poetry.”
Our society has become the angry leered-at woman who doesn't care that men can build buildings or do amazing things like to be good dads, husbands and sons. They focus instead on the small flaws that some men have and extrapolates to all men; they are all dogs, rapists, perverts, deadbeats and worthless. Who needs them?
We do. Our society has forgotten the wonder of men in its quest for retribution against men and boys who often weren't even alive when women were being discriminated against. Many men understand the war that is going on against them and they are going underground or withdrawing their talents and going on strike in marriage, fatherhood, education and in society in general. They may not speak about it or use a megaphone to let the world know of their pain, frustration, and anger or just plain apathy, but it is there—raw and just underneath the surface. We as a society must wake up to what we are doing to men before it is too late and we live in a world that has left male potential in a wasteland.
Our society is made better by men who are productive, happy and treated with fairness. We have only ourselves to blame if we do not turn the tide of the war on men, for without half the human experience, our society can crumble, just as surely as those New York buildings would if they no longer had men to work their sublime male poetry on them. Is that the world you want to live in? I don't.
NEWARK — An Obama administration reunion tour is unfolding in New Jersey, as a cavalcade of Democratic luminaries has paraded into the state in recent days, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez and former Secretary of State John Kerry, urging voters to make Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate, their governor.
One by one, they have asked voters to treat the election for governor as a chance to preserve former President Barack Obama's policies at the state level, even as they are under assault in Washington.
Mr. Obama themselves is scheduled to appear with Mr. Murphy on Thursday at a rally in Newark, making their first public foray on the campaign trail in support of a Democratic candidate since leaving office. And Hillary Clinton will be a guest of honor at a closed-door fund-raiser for Mr. Murphy on Sunday in Harrison, N.J., their first campaign event since last year's election.
The emphasis on a low-profile, off-year election for governor in New Jersey, where Mr. Murphy holds a commanding lead in recent polls to replace the Republican Chris Christie, reflects the Democratic Party's changing priorities with it out of power in Washington. As the party has poured energy and money into contesting special elections for federal offices this year, elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia — the only two statewide races in the country this year — offer Mr. Obama and their allies perhaps their best chance to protect policy achievements at the state level.
The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have shuffled their personnel again.
Gary Crowton was fired as the team's offensive co-ordinator and quarterbacks coach Sunday as the team continues to stumble on the field.
Marcel Bellefeuille will take over co-ordinator duties in Winnipeg (1-6) for the rest of the year. The Blue Bombers have lost five in a row, including a 37-18 loss to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on Friday in Winnipeg.
"No one in our organization is happy with the way we have performed so far this season," said Bombers head coach Tim Burke. "Our offence has not played up to their standards and we need to make this change in order to give us a chance at remaining in the hunt for the post-season. I wish Gary all the best in their future endeavours."
Bellefeuille was added to Winnipeg's coaching staff on Aug. 12 after spending last season with the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League.
They were Hamilton's head coach from 2009-2011 and has an extensive background in the CFL, working as a position coach and offensive co-ordinator with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Montreal Alouettes and Ticats.
Crowton isn't the first casualty of Winnipeg's rough start to the season.
Embattled CEO and president Garth Butchko resigned from their position and was replaced by former Blue Bomber player Wade Miller on Aug. 10.
Miller's first act as acting CEO was to fire general manager Joe Mack and name assistant general manager Kyle Walters as the acting general manager on Aug. 13.
They never really played games before, let alone seriously. This sentiment, coming from several of the competitors at this weekend's Mobile Masters: Las Vegas e-sports tournament, was the most inspiring.
For all the ‘free-to-play' and ‘pay-to-win and ‘baby game' complaints that gets bandied about by ‘core' gamers regarding mobile gaming, the fact is mobile games reach a wider and more diverse audience; Moms, Dads, Kids, Grandparents all have access to the thousands of games on the Google Play and Apple Appstore.
This means literally anyone could download Vainglory, World of Tanks: Blitz, or Power Rangers: Legacy War, find they have a knack for it, and months later find themselves on national television.
And that's exactly what happened. During Mobile Masters: Las Vegas's media day, the competitors in the above games were interviewed by a panel of curious journalists, and one fact rang clear regarding their sudden ‘pro' status: They never saw it coming.
The competitors range widely in age, race, background, and gaming knowledge. But what seems to unify them all is the fact they downloaded their game of choice for the same reason any of us would – it seemed fun.
And now here they are.
One player downloaded World of Tank: Blitz on a whim on break at work, and now finds themselves in Las Vegas competing for thousands of dollars. They don't own a console or PC.
Another player, curiously similar in manner and appearance to Miles Teller, started playing ‘Vainglory' in the wake of a serious injury derailed their dream of joining the military, and they needed a distraction while rehabbing on a stationary bike – they now play Vainglory as their full-time job.
One of the Power Rangers: Legacy War players is 30 years old and has two kids. Some players are still in high school. Most have ‘real' jobs. One quit their ‘real job' to abscond to South Korea for a tournament…which their team won. Another had their parents go with them to the same tournament.
These stories could be filed under dictionary definition of “The American Dream”.
When interviewing the Amazon Executive that made the ‘Mobile Masters' tournaments a reality, they said they wanted to make The ‘Super Bowl of Mobile Gaming'. While a noble ambition and one that may yet be fulfilled, what he's actually done is created The World Series of Poker of E-Sports – in spirit, anyway.
Back in the day online poker gave the regular Joe or Jane an opportunity for immortality from the comfort of their living room. The ability to play a game online and translate that into real-world money, glory, and fame was intoxicating and lead to the mid-2000s poker boom.
When Chris Moneymaker turned an $86 World Series of Poker qualifier into a 3.2 million dollar victory, the entirety of America thought they could do it too. And…they could…and did. Online poker was accessible, relatively cheap, and ‘the game' was in your head and not based on how fast, strong, quick, or athletic you were. The barrier to participation was practically nil.
And by focusing on mobile e-sports, Mobile Masters is doing the exact same thing. The barrier to entry is literally owning one of the 7 billion plus mobile devices on the planet.
None of the players expected to ‘go pro', but like Chris Moneymaker, here they are, on the precipice of winning thousands of dollars and legitimizing themselves and their favorite – and sometimes only game in a big bad way.
The full tournament will be broadcast on Twitch.TV, and a produced, W.S.O.P-esque version will air on CBS Sports. The players are dialed in, humble, excited, and ready to kick some digital butt for themselves, their games, and for every single person in this whole wide world with a cell-phone that can watch and think to themselves they can do it too.
Because they very well could.

Silicon Valley's surveillance-based business model relies heavily on machine learning. But with the right techniques, we can resist the enclosure of our lives for profit and disrupt the disruptors.
This piece is also available in audio from our friends at Curio.io.
Machine learning is the practice of training algorithms to classify and predict in order to support decision-making. In recent years, it has skyrocketed in popularity and ubiquity. It's no stretch to say that most services we use now incorporate machine learning in one way or another. In its pervasiveness, machine learning is becoming infrastructural. And, like all infrastructure, once it matures it will become invisible.
Before that happens, we should develop a way to disrupt it.
A relatively nascent field called "adversarial machine learning" provides a starting point. Described as the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning, this field studies how these algorithms can be systematically fooled, with or without knowledge of the algorithm itself—an ideal approach, since the specifics of many algorithms are trade secrets. And given the fact that the machine learning regime effectively makes all of us its workers—most of our online activity is in fact labor towards the improvement of these systems—we as individual users have an opportunity to inflict major sabotage.
Consider an early and now-ubiquitous application of machine learning: the everyday spam filter. The job of the spam filter is to categorize an email as either "spam"—junk—or "ham"—non-spam. The simplest case of adversarial machine learning in this context is constructing an email that is spam—a pitch for a pharmaceutical product, for example—but in such a way that the spam filter misclassifies it as ham, thus letting it through to the recipient.
There are a variety of strategies you might employ to accomplish this. A relatively simple one is swapping out the name of "Viagra" for something more obscure to a machine but equally readable to a human: "Vi@gr@", for example.
Today, most spam filters are resistant to this basic obfuscation attack. But we could consider more sophisticated approaches, such as writing a longer, professional-looking email that hints at the product without ever explicitly mentioning it. The hint may be strikingly obvious to a human, but incomprehensible to a spam filter.
A spam filter is less insidious than many other applications of machine learning, of course. But we can generalize from this example to develop techniques for disrupting other applications more worthy of sabotage.
Poisoning the Well
Most machine learning models are constructed according to the following general procedure:
Collect training data. Run a machine learning algorithm, such as a neural network, over the training data to learn from it. Integrate the model into your service.
Many websites collect training data with embedded code that tracks what you do on the internet. This information is supposed to identify your preferences, habits, and other facets of your online and offline activity. The effectiveness of this data collection relies on the assumption that browsing habits are an honest portrayal of an individual.
A simple act of sabotage is to violate this assumption by generating "noise" while browsing. You can do this by opening random links, so that it's unclear which are the "true" sites you've visited—a process automated by Dan Schultz's Internet Noise project, available at makeinternetnoise.com. Because your data is not only used to make assumptions about you, but about other users with similar browsing patterns, you end up interfering with the algorithm's conclusions about an entire group of people.
Of course, the effectiveness of this tactic, like all others described here, increases when more people are using it. As the CIA's Simple Sabotage Field Manual explains, "Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizens, can be an effective weapon...[wasting] materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on...the enemy."
Attacks of this sort—where we corrupt the training data of these systems—are known as "poisoning" attacks.
The Pathological and the Perturbed
The other category of adversarial machine learning attacks are known as "evasion.” This strategy targets systems that have already been trained. Rather than trying to corrupt training data, it tries to generate pathological inputs that confuse the model, causing it to generate incorrect results.
The spam filter attack, where you trick an algorithm into seeing spam as ham, is an example of evasion. Another is "Hyperface," a collaboration between Hyphen Labs and Adam Harvey, a specially designed scarf engineered to fool facial recognition systems by exploiting the heuristics these systems used to identify faces. Similarly, in a recent study, researchers developed a pair of glasses that consistently cause a state-of-the-art facial recognition system to misclassify faces it would otherwise identify with absolute certainty.
Above: the input of people wearing the glasses designed to confuse facial-recognition software. Below: the misidentified individuals.
Another domain of computer vision is object recognition. If facial recognition is about recognizing faces, object recognition is about identifying objects. For instance, you might ask an object recognition system to look at a picture of a panda and identify the panda.
Recently, computer science researchers developed a "universal perturbation algorithm" capable of systematically fooling many object recognition algorithms by adding relatively small amounts of noise to the image. This noise is almost imperceptible to a human, but causes the object recognition system to misclassify objects. For example, an image of a coffee maker that has been treated with the universal perturbation algorithm will look like a macaw to the object recognition system.
Above: the original, correctly classified inputs. Below: the incorrectly classified inputs, post-perturbation.
The writer Evan Calder Williams defines sabotage as:
the impossibly small difference between exceptional failures and business as usual, connected by the fact that the very same properties and tendencies enable either outcome.
Serendipitously, this is the literal mechanic by which the universal perturbation algorithm works. An object recognition neural network, for instance, takes an image and maps it to a point in some abstract space. Different regions of this space correspond to different labels—so an image of a coffee maker ideally maps to the coffee maker region.
But these regions are irregular in form. The categories of macaw and coffee maker may be very similar in certain dimensions. That means it takes only slight nudges—accomplished by introducing the noise into the image—to push a coffee maker image into the macaw region.
One advantage of the perturbation algorithm is that its distortions are invisible to the human eye. Sabotage that sticks out as sabotage is not very successful. Well-executed sabotage leaves doubts not only about its origins but also whether it was deliberate or accidental. That is, it leaves doubts about whether or not it was sabotage at all.
By contrast, if you use Internet Noise, the random browsing that results might be identifiable as such, in which case it may simply be excluded from the data set. This may help you escape the training regime, but it won't smuggle misinformation into the system to disrupt that regime for others.
If, however, the random browsing was not random but generated according to subtly misleading patterns—like the imperceptible noise in the perturbed images—then the misinformation may make its way into the training data. And if there is enough of it, it will poison the model as a whole.
Protracted People's War
Research in adversarial machine learning typically falls under the rubric of cybersecurity, so it has some similarities to the field of cryptography. The success of cryptography depends on difficult mathematical operations, such as factoring prime numbers.
These operations are relatively easy for individuals or small organizations to take advantage of, and mostly resilient against adversaries with more resources. The marvel of cryptography is that it is a technology that runs against the typical gradients of power. It favors the less powerful against the more powerful.
Perhaps something similar is at work with adversarial machine learning, favoring the resister against the machine. To quote Ian Goodfellow and Nicolas Papernot, two leading researchers in the field:
On the theoretical side, no one yet knows whether defending against adversarial examples is a theoretically hopeless endeavor ... or if an optimal strategy would give the defender the upper ground.... On the applied side, no one has yet designed a truly powerful defense algorithm that can resist a wide variety of adversarial example attack algorithms.
Like cryptography, the goal of such disruption is not necessarily a single act of sabotage, but rather a distributed undertaking that decreases the cost-effectiveness of data collection at scale. In the case of cryptography, the more people who use encrypted communication applications like Signal, the more expensive state surveillance becomes—hopefully to the point where it becomes infeasible. Similarly, the less accurate these machine learning systems become due to user disruption, the more costly they are, and the less likely they are to be relied upon.
While adversarial machine learning is still in its early years, perhaps it will provide a tactic to complement the parallel struggles on the policy level. We are under no obligation to honestly train these models. If regimes of algorithmic discipline are implemented without our consent, we will need a toolbox of resistance that can directly disrupt their effectiveness.

It's a sign that we're living in the future when using our own genetic machinery as a form of calculator or storage is nothing new — but make no mistake, it's still very early days in this field and there are plenty of surprises ahead. Today's surprise, for instance, is the use of DNA to do exact arithmetical calculations entirely in analog.
One might expect that any calculating done by a DNA would sort of by definition analog, but that's not the case. In fact, DNA is useful for this kind of thing precisely because it is, in a way, already digital. The process of arranging base pairs into codons, which is how DNA encodes information, is remarkably like how we use binary symbols in sequence to form bytes.
Such a ready digital analogue, if you will, makes DNA a natural fit for the type of programming we've already developed. But that's not the only way to use it.
Duke computer scientists, led by Professor John Reif and grad student Tianqi Song, have shown that DNA can perform mathematical functions without aping computers composed of switches and logic gates.
DNA strands, of course, have two sides, and pieces with bases that correspond — adenine with thymine, cytosine with guanine — will naturally attach to one another. And the more matching base pairs, the better the fit. This makes it possible to create various strands that will interact with each other in predictable ways — this one with a great fit will displace that one, and a third will displace one but not the other. (Note: this paragraph originally listed the wrong chemicals for DNA's bases, which for some reason I wrote in a hurry and forgot to double-check. That's embarrassing.)
You get enough of these pieces, you can start building a logic to how they interact. That's what the team did, and by controlling the input strands and watching for the final concentrations of each, they created a process that can do addition, subtraction, and multiplication — with more complex operations on the way.
Now, this isn't meant to replace digital computing, naturally, or even digital computing using DNA. Simple calculations take hours to do, and the logic isn't easily adjustable.
“We can't even begin to think of competing with modern-day PCs or other conventional computing devices,” cautioned Reif in the Duke news release. But, they added, “Even very simple DNA computing could still have huge impacts in medicine or science.”
Slow they may be, but these operations are being done with just a handful of easily replicated strands. Imitations of digital computers involve much more molecular machinery — which also happens to be highly fragile. Analog DNA computing could be done within the body's natural environment, since it could be carefully coded to avoid strands being interfered with by the usual genetic processes.
DNA calculators swimming in your bloodstream could constantly be calculating the levels of a medication, activating a protein signal when it dips below a certain level. Strands attached to special molecules made to detect, say, cancer cells could also start a process that alerts doctors or even kickstarts the body's own immune reaction.
The research, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, was published in the journal Synthetic Biology.

[+470, -40] "Please avoid using the color orange" Instant retweet3. [+391, -32] You don't even have to be a member of Shinhwa Changjo to know that the color orange belongs to them. Anyone with even a teensy bit of interest would know that. What is YG thinking printing goods in that color...? I bet even iKON fans are pissed with YGㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ4. [+205, -12] That's right, Shinhwa is still a promoting idol group, it's best not to overlap colors5. [+203, -12] Eric knows that even if they get hate for speaking out about it, they know how much the color means to their fans. So many people think of Eric as just an actor but it seems they know that their true identity is that of an idol singer.6. [+184, -16] Shinhwa and Shinhwa Changjo have been using the color for 18 years now. Please think of what it means to us.7. [+158, -16] Shinhwa is an idol group that has been running for 18 years. They have been using the color orange since debut, and have managed to release an album every single year excluding their time in the military, and continue to do so with Seoul + Asia tours and promotions on all three public broadcasts. They have worked harder than any idol and should not have to suffer the discomfort of having their color overlap with another group.8. [+156, -18] Please just leave Shinhwa alone.. ㅜ9. [+108, -12] He's right, orange belongs to Shinhwa.10. [+75, -15] We understand that the color orange is pretty and coveted but leave us alone. So many groups have tried to take the color but it can only be used by Shinhwa and Shinhwa Changjo.11. [+59, -10] I didn't even know there was an idol group named iKON. Anyone who has any interest in celebrities would know that orange belongs to Shinhwa. I'm sure those juniors didn't know, so what gives? No respect for their seniors? Eric proves to be the leader once again...12. [+49, -10] YG is such a nuisance to their artists13. [+45, -10] I don't even know what the point of another group insisting on using orange is? Shinhwa continues to promote as an active group 18 years in with no disbandments or member changes. If iKON fans are seen in the crowd holding orange support sticks, everyone's just going to think you're a Shinhwa Changjo. There was confusion even recently with overlapping fandom colors and the singers themselves thought they were their fans when they weren't ㅋㅋㅋ14. [+44, -9] So is this about the rumors of iKON's support stick being orange ㅎㅎ15. [+40, -11] Shinhwa = orange is so ingrained in everyone that I'm surprised there are even still groups that are attempting to use that color1. [+6,206, -620] It's not like Shinhwa's an inactive group... poor iKON having to deal with YG2. [+5,597, -874] I had no intention of ever putting iKON down but when fans went to YG to petition the color, they called it some stupid persimmon color and the rest of us were treated like we were blind while they cosplayed as the victims in all of this. Why should we even be the ones petitioning it to begin with?3. [+3,441, -344] Reminds me of when BoA entered the music industry with a bucket full of hate for using the color orange when it belonged to Sechs Kies...4. [+5,178, -997] Just how bad were the fandom fights that even Eric had to step in5. [+2,566, -405] iKON fans, we're sorry this is happening. I think us fans got aggressive because these color controversies have come up so often in the past few years. I think we should all take a step back and assess the situation for a bit.6. [+497, -53] Why does YG always screw up iKON's stuff. They've screwed them over so many times from their stupid promotion tactics already. It's like YG is purposely trying so hard to get iKON hate. Poor iKON.

A rotting animal leg that has sat atop a bus stop for "a few months" has raised hackles in Clapham Junction.
The severed limb - that of a goat according to one report - was first spotted on the clear-roofed bus stop by Riz Wasti, who tweeted at Wandsworth Council: "Seeing this leg of lamb at bus stop Y near Clapham/Northcote Road for few months.
"Prob well done by now?!"
Wandsworth referred the matter to Transport for London (TfL), calling it "not a very nice sight" and asking them to remove it.
@RizWasti Not a very nice sight! @TfL please can you remove this from the roof of your bus shelter o/s 79 St. John's Road, SW11 1QZ — Wandsworth Council (@wandbc) April 13, 2015
The Wandsworth Guardian reports the aroma has got one commuter's goat, with graphic designer Suzanne Perkins asking the paper: "Why has it been there so long? What is going on with general street cleaning?
"It's just awful. It is weird and bizarre. I think it's funny in a sense of it being a bizarre object but really quite serious when you think what is happening in the urban environment?"
TfL told the Standard it was taking action to remove the leg today - nearly three weeks after the council asked it to do so.
It is not known how the leg came to be on top of the shelter.
“American Sniper” is the highest-grossing 2014 domestic release.
The R-rated drama has made $337.2 million since debuting in a handful of theaters last December. That puts it ahead of “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1” and its $336.8 million haul as the top film to debut last year.
With a budget of $58.8 million, the biopic of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle represents a substantial return on Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow's investment.
“The heroic story of Chris Kyle just hit the zeitgeist,” said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. distribution executive vice president. “It doesn't matter your politics — it's a story that just touched everybody personally.”
Globally, “American Sniper” won't be able to match the $1.1 billion that “Transformers: Age of Extinction” pulled in, but it has been a robust performer, particularly given that films with patriotic subject matter don't tend to travel well abroad. It has made more than $140 million in foreign markets.
“American Sniper” easily outstrips director Clint Eastwood's previous releases, giving the 84-year-old the biggest hit of their career. It's also star Bradley Cooper's highest-grossing domestic release.

“American Sniper” is an unlikely blockbuster — there are no fantastical elements, and the film deals with the unpopular Iraq War, something that has been box office poison for pictures like “Rendition” and “In the Valley of Elah.” It also marks the first time since 1998's “Saving Private Ryan” that a realistic drama and a R-rated film has been the top domestic release.
The film had its detractors, with some critics decrying the picture for whitewashing the life story of Kyle and for lionizing sharpshooters. However, the film played well in both red and blue states, with audience members responding to the film's depiction of Kyle as a dedicated serviceman and hero.
“American Sniper” hadn't even been scheduled for release last year. It was originally slated to debut in Christmas of 2015, but Eastwood finished editing the picture early.
“It was a brilliant film from a brilliant director,” said Goldstein. “All the stars aligned perfectly.”
In a speech to law enforcement officials on Friday, President Trump received applause after encouraging police officers to be physically “rough” when handling suspects they arrest.
While giving a major law enforcement and immigration policy speech in Long Island, N.Y., the president endorsed police brutality when they told police officers not to be “too nice” to suspects they are arresting.
The president suggested that officers should not be concerned with the suspects' safety, telling officers to hit their heads on the doors of their police cars.
“When you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, and I said, ‘Please don't be too nice,'” Trump told the audience at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood.
“Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over, like, don't hit their head and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head, I said, ‘You can take the hand away, OK?'” they added.
Their remarks received a round of applause.
“For years and years, [laws have] been made to protect the criminal,” Trump said. “Totally protect the criminal, not the officers. You do something wrong, you're in more jeopardy than they are. These laws are stacked against you. We're changing those laws.”
President urges officers to commit acts of brutality, officers laugh and cheer wildly. Beginning to think problem isn't a few bad apples. pic.twitter.com/o1sSgw6lGy — Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) July 28, 2017

There was once a fun, lighthearted digital subway ad in Sweden touting haircare products. As soon as a train flew by, the woman's hair in the sign tossed around, as if windswept by the train's motion. People loved the ad so much that is remained in the train station for days — and soon, the world took notice of this awesomely innovate way to advertise.
As a result, the team at Barncancer Fonden — Swedish healthcare professionals aiming to treat and cure cancer — used this same creative technique to spread awareness about something much more important than haircare. The company, inspired by the train that whizzed by and cued up the sign on the platform, made their own version but with a stunning twist. The results are so incredible that “A Hair-Raising Message” has gone viral with more than ten million views. Just watch.
Garbergs, the agency who created the ad, says, “The world shares the film not just because they think it's beautifully made, but because they think the message is beautiful.”
People have come up with some pretty creative ways to utilize everyday spaces, and what happens in this video is no exception.

In theory, 2016 should have been a banner year for Kazuchika Okada. They began by defeating their long-time rival Hiroshi Tanahashi in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 10, retaining their IWGP Heavyweight Championship title and solidifying their status as ‘Ace' of New Japan Pro-Wrestling in the process. At least, that was the story being presented and, while fans were happy to cheer along as Okada proved themselves once and for all against Tanahashi, their adulation seemed less fervent than it had just a few years previously.
Okada entered the main stage of New Japan Wrestling at The New Beginning 2012, shocking the pro-wrestling world as the young upstart who dethroned Hiroshi Tanahashi, the iconic central figure of NJPW. Tanahashi was still immensely popular, but significant sections of the audience were beginning to tire of seeing their name at the top of every card and then here came this brash youngster thrust into the spotlight, a newly minted member of the CHAOS stable and with an influential presence at their side in the form of the often outspoken Gedo.
If Tanahashi represented the establishment, Okada and their upset first IWGP title reign was a signal to fans that things were about to change. Ultimately, that change took longer than Okada would have liked and, as their feud with Tanahashi became ever more protracted, somewhere along the way Okada became the very establishment figure they were originally fighting against. Fast forward to 2016 and in Okada's eyes, in Gedo's eyes and in the promotion's eyes they have donned the mantle of ‘Ace', but whether the fans agree is another matter entirely.
Tanahashi certainly doesn't. A few months after their Wrestle Kingdom 10 match Okada had lost the title and Tanahashi reverted to calling themselves the ‘Ace of the Universe', resumed wearing ring gear with ‘Ace' emblazoned upon it and (after the joint shows with ROH in February) co-opted Moose's chant for himself, encouraging crowds to chant “ACE!” at every opportunity. What's more, in spite of Okada reclaiming their title shortly before the biggest tour of the year (the 26th annual G1 Climax), it was Tanahashi who was chosen to main event more shows that Okada in their tournament block.
Then there's the elephant in the room, the man who cost Okada their title (albeit, for just a few short months), ‘Los Ingobernable' Tetsuya Naito. Since returning from Mexico last year and forming Los Ingobernables de Japon with EVIL, BUSHI & SANADA, Naito's popularity has grown immensely. Always considered a popular figure because of their spectacular in-ring ability, they seemed to lack the charisma to take them to the next level and some unfortunate injuries further hampered their career. But that all changed with their newfound attitude, penchant for rule breaking and their anti-authoritarian streak that has seen them attacking officials and embarrassing NJPW management.
One of Naito's main points of contention is the blatant favouritism NJPW shows towards Okada, especially in the wake of the high-profile departures of Nakamura, Styles, Anderson & Gallows to WWE earlier this year. NJPW President Takaaki Kidani reportedly said they would offer Okada “whatever it takes” to commit their future to New Japan and announced a 200 million yen project to make Okada the face of the promotion. Naito feels (perhaps with good reason) that they aren't being given a fair shake of the stick, that they just aren't palatable to NJPW management and that, while Okada will be given opportunity after opportunity, Naito will always have to fight for their opportunities and greater recognition.
This has seemingly struck a chord with the NJPW audience, Naito embodying the salaryman thumbing their nose in the face of their superiors. Plus, it helps that Naito and their newfound swagger has made for a hugely entertaining act over the past year, albeit one that's proved to be a big headache for Kidaani and co. The result has seen swathes of Los Ingobernables merchandise dominating arenas, those same fans who booed them a few years ago cheering them like never before and chanting along with their catchphrases. It's even seen fans begin to turn on Okada when the two have faced off in the ring, but not yet in numbers to phase The Rainmaker, nor to convince the powers that be that New Japan should alter course.
In essence, Okada and Naito have exchanged roles, but with one stark difference: there will be no easy path to the top for Tetsuya Naito. Especially now that Okada, the former anti-establishment figure, is such a heavy focus of NJPW's marketing, with numerous magazine spreads, talk show appearances, adverts and anime credits to their name this year alone. But perhaps Naito realises that. In interviews he's seemed resigned to the fact that he'll never be able to catch a break with the decision makers in the promotion, yet that admission only serves to further the fan's growing admiration for him. And as the newly crowned IWGP Intercontinental Champion they have the chance to indirectly turn that admiration against Okada and make the fans question which is really the top prize and, by extension, who is the top champion in NJPW.
And what of Okada? They may have the title, they may have the backing of NJPW management, but with all of that comes increased responsibilities. As he's (somewhat arrogantly) stated himself, the promotion is now ostensibly borne upon their shoulders, yet in what should be their most triumphant year to date, he's being upstaged by the man New Japan had written off and overlooked in favour of the tried-and-tested or the latest imported talent. It's not just the fan's reactions either, it's evident in Okada's performances between the ropes. While 2016 has seen a number of great Okada matches, there's a steady, skillful feel to their output. To those who have been critical of what they deem as overly formulaic matches on Okada's behalf will have seen little to alter their opinions this year.
Perhaps the gilded veneer of The Rainmaker is starting to wear thin, or perhaps he's struggling under the weight of expectations. Whatever the case may be, between the ungovernable rise of Tetsuya Naito and Hiroshi Tanahashi's stubborn refusal to go quietly into the night, something needs to change if Okada is to truly be seen as the top guy in fan's estimation and to cement their status as ‘Ace' of New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Yet if things pan out the way a fair few fans expect them to, it could be both of Okada's greatest obstacles facing off in the audience's most anticipated match at Wrestle Kingdom 11 next January. It would certainly make for an interesting parallel: Okada's big main event at Wrestle Kingdom 8 denied by the fans distaste for Naito at the time, then three years later Okada's grand stage at Wrestle Kingdom 11 usurped by their greatest rivals, past and present.
• Former PSV player still adjusting to schedule at United • ‘It's heavy, two games a week, always at a high level'
Manchester United's Memphis Depay admits they are still trying to adapt to the physical demands of life in the Premier League.
Depay, signed from PSV Eindhoven for £25m in July, has struggled to make an impact so far at Old Trafford, with manager Louis van Gaal last month urging critics to give them time: “I have to be patient for Memphis, and the fans do also.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Memphis Depay's fashion-sense caused a stir in Holland in August.
Speaking to De Telegraaf before Holland's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against Kazakhstan on Saturday, Depay said: “There are a lot of games in Manchester. There are very few rest days and on training days you are mainly concerned with recovering. It's heavy, two games a week, always at a high level, and my body has to get used to that.”
But they said they had no concerns about their ability to be a success, adding: “I try to manage my career in steps, and I am still in the middle. I think this was the right step and I am happy in Manchester … I'm still developing.”
One issue apparently causing Depay concern, though, is how their off-field fashion sense has amused sections of the Dutch media.
Depay reportedly refused to speak to journalists after training on Tuesday, telling them: “I don't want to talk to you lot.”

That was one small step for San Francisco but one Giants step for MLB. A predicted one-sided World Series now has legs for the TV audience.
TV ratings for the San Francisco Giants' NLCS Game 7 clincher on Monday ranked well behind the U.S presidential debate and the NFL's Monday Night game between Detroit and Chicago. You can understand trailing President Obama and Governor Romney and their 59.2 million viewers. But should a run-of-the-mill NFL game (10.1 million) beat one of the prime jewels of the MLB season (8.1 million)?

Baseball ain't what it once was, the dominant sport in the U.S. The NFL is the NFL. Unto itself. Baseball is still captive to its Boomer fans swooning for Ken Burns. It would be stretching things to say hip-hop culture and the indie movement embrace the game. Its stars are a long way from the NBA of LeBron and Kobe and Melo. Can't think of many pickup lines that start with, "So which Verlander pitch do you fear most?"
But MLB has made a very healthy recovery from its disastrous 1994 strike. The steroid scandals of Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Roger Clemens and Alex Rodriguez have been minimized in the public mind. Some fans will never come back– supporters of the Montreal Expos?– but baseball has found its happy place in the television universe that defines the sports hierarchy these days.
A prime baseball game now draws the same numbers as an NBA postseason game, the final round of a PGA Tour major or an NCAA Bowl game. (That blows away an NHL game on U.S. TV.) Baseball isn't the champ, but it's a reliable draw and, unlike its sister pro sports, MLB doesn't lock out its players anymore.
Despite the heroics of Pablo Sandoval in Game 1 it's hard to know whether the Giants make this World Series a classic that breaks recent viewership numbers. But the fact that baseball is still alive and capable of having eight million or more tune in for a game is an object lesson for all of its competitors and their labour lawyers.

Last week we were ragging on the MLB International TV feed which Sportsnet is contractually obliged to carry. Rick Sutcliffe, no virtual strike zone and some poor camera calls were bugging us.
But Game 1's World Series of product placement on FOX has us reconsidering. Before the first pitch, FOX trotted out its latest American Idol Phillip Phillips winner to do a grunge American anthem. Then there was a free taco from Taco Bell for a stolen base. Billy Crystal was front and centre shilling for their new film. Then there was the opening pitch by Budweiser. No mas, no mas!

Finish what you start
While Game 1 was no contest, FOX's Tim McCarver picked up the slack with a classic rainy day story, reminding viewers of the best-pitched game ever on July 2, 1963 in San Fran. It was a 16-inning, 1-0 win for the Giants. San Fran starter Juan Marichal threw 234 pitches while Braves starter Warren Spahn faced 56 hitters. McCarver said Marichal's manager Herman Franks wanted to take their starter out, but the Giants' ace said, "If that fat old man can keep going, so can I." McCarver missed the best part: When they gave up the hit to Willie Mays in the 16th, Spahn was 42 years old.
Gotcha game
Interesting to see American sports writer Jason Whitlock, who is black, talking about the "bubble" surrounding black quarterbacks in the NFL. Whitlock, who is often a contrarian on race matters, suggested on FOX.com that the petulant performance of Carolina QB Cam Newton after Sunday's loss is due, in part, to enablers in the black community protecting Newton from legitimate criticism as a means to protect him.
"Black sports fans and black pop-culture media (not sports media) have created a loosely-formed-but-influential social-media and talk-radio information bubble for black QBs. This network of groupthink roars on sports-talk radio, black-owned radio stations, Facebook and Twitter, pumping out the message that Newton, (Robert) Griffin (III) and others can do no wrong and any criticism of them is rooted in racism. Fear of backlash from this network of well-intentioned enablers causes many mainstream sports analysts (media and fans of all colors) to avoid being totally honest about black QBs."
Whitlock points out that this does not happen to white quarterbacks. Which was pretty much the point Rush Limbaugh was making in 2003 when ESPN fired them from its NFL broadcasts after they said that the media went soft on Donovan McNabb because it wanted a black quarterback to succeed. Whitlock was among those who went after Limbaugh at the time, saying they were just trying to get attention for their radio show.
Story continues below advertisement
When Whitlock was challenged on their contradictory stance Wednesday, they wrote that Limbaugh was not qualified to have ripped McNabb in 2003, because the conservative radio host wasn't a sports guy of long standing. Which is the, "You can't criticize music unless you play it" logic. Lame.
But Whitlock has perfectly captured the media gotcha syndrome pertaining to race in the U.S. Some can talk about it, Others, not. And no sign that any of that will change soon, however the U.S. election turns out.

Gun Training for Women
So, you've just bought your first gun and now it's time to consider your training. The choices you make for your gun training is as important as the decision to own a gun. As with any important decision in life, it is important to do research on gun training for women ahead of time to arm yourself with the knowledge you will need to make the right choice for you. Below is a little advice to help you get started on your search and choices in women's gun training options..
Utilize Local Resources
When looking for the right gun-training course near you, local gun shops, gun shows, and shooting ranges are a great place to start. Visit their websites to begin your research. When it comes to gun training for women, it can be a challenge to find instruction that understands the needs of women. You will likely find instruction “geared” toward women, but that doesn't mean they are gifted to teach women.
Spend some time doing your research on each training company and its instructors. Some things to consider:
How long have they been training women?
What kind of credentials do they have?
Do they have female instructors on staff? (This is not necessary as you don't need to be trained by a woman, but it is a good indication that the training company is eager to meet the needs of its women clientele)
Are there any reviews on the courses?
Once you have identified some options, I suggest you go and meet with them and talk with them directly. You will know quickly if they are genuinely committed to training women well and with respect. Intuitively, you will know!
Here is a link to a national listing of female TWAW instructors
What To Look For
Look for a training organization that offers a wide range of courses taught by highly experienced instructors. Find a course that offers gun training for women to develop the following basic skills:
Firearm safety
Basic handling/manipulation of a firearm
One-handed shooting techniques
Quick and safe reloading
Drawing from a holster or concealed carry purse
Shooting accuracy
How to shoot at moving targets/moving while firing
Defending yourself against multiple targets
Shooting in low light conditions
What Kind Of Course Is Best?
The type of course you choose will depend on your skill level and what you want the training to accomplish. Whether you want to learn about gun handling basics, armed self defense, tactical training or competitive shooting, there is a gun training class for you. Thinking about getting a Concealed Carry (CCW) permit? In many states, you'll have to take a CCW training course as part of the application process. Once you've determined which type of course you'll need, the next step is finding the right provider in your area.
Continue Shooting With Other Women
Consider joining one of the hundreds of The Well Armed Woman Shooting Chapters across the nation. TWAW Shooting Chapters is a non-profit organization that organizes local groups of women around the country that meet monthly to practice, learn and grow as shooters. Creating opportunities for women to be introduced to issues important to women shooters, learn safe gun handling skills and train together.
Consider NRA & USCCA Training Courses
Another great resource is The National Rifle Association. The NRA certifies firearm instructors and one can be found almost anywhere!! The NRA offers a wide variety of courses including Women On Target®. This is series of Instructional Shooting Clinics designed specifically for women that teach the basics of safe gun handling, storing and shooting. You can choose from a variety of NRA training courses from the basic through more advanced shooting techniques and skills.
The USCCA also has a wonderful training program and certified instructors all across the country. They offer anumber of courses focused on your self defense with a firearm with an emphasis on the legal ramifications. You can find instructors and courses here
Practice Makes Perfect
I believe gun ownership and training go together as a package. You can't have one without the other. As with any skill, the more you practice, the better you'll be, and gun handling is one skill you must work to be the best you can be at.. Your training is an ongoing commitment. Find training centers and instructors who can guide you and help you grow as a shooter. Even though finding gun training for women may be tough – it is worth the effort to find the right partner for you.
A man tried to attack their ex-wife's husband with a pair of nunchucks. But they didn't account for the fact that the husband was armed and ready.
According to WISHTV, Anthony Casada got into an argument with their ex-wife over their daughter's phone bill, and it escalated to the point where Casada, who reportedly has a history of violent behavior and has a restraining order filed against them by their ex-wife, threatened them and their current husband, Dave Gregory.
Gregory said that they and their wife were in the back patio of their home in Hendricks County, IN when their dog began barking, and they saw Casada emerge from a truck holding nunchucks with "rage" in their eyes.
"My thoughts were, 'he's going to try and beat me up or kill me with these nunchucks then go take it out on my wife,'" Gregory told WISHTV.
But Gregory was armed and ready to take on Casada.
"I told them he's an idiot," Gregory said. "I pointed my gun at him. They kept making progress toward me, swinging their nunchucks and that's when I shot him."
Casada was shot six times and taken to Eskenazi Hospital, where they are in critical condition.
"If they could've got Dave, they would've definitely come after me no doubt," Gregory's wife told WISHTV, reportedly in tears.
They later said, "I give all my love and appreciation to my husband. They did a phenomenal job and he'd do it again, for their family. That's the kind of man they are."
Gregory and their wife were fortunate to be armed with a gun, as there are women who have to deal with stalker ex-boyfriends and are unable to arm themselves due to strict gun laws in the state. For instance, Carol Bowne in New Jersey was stabbed to death by their ex-boyfriend, and they were unable to get a gun in time to arm themselves because their application for a gun permit was held up by the state's bureaucracy. If not for the gun laws, perhaps they would have been to be able to fend off their ex, just like Gregory and their wife were able to fight off Casada.

Seems liberals are out to ruin everything these days. Slate — the same liberal rag that said racism may explain why some people like white turkey meat — decided to give liberals advise on how to ruin the family holiday meal.
“Despite what you've heard about avoiding holiday conflict, now is your time to fight,” John Cook wrote. So much for holiday cheer and civility.
“If your family is anything like mine,” they wrote, “then Thanksgiving is sort of like a brief military deployment after months and months of training. You've prepared all year in Internet comment sections and by yelling at Fox News on the television screen, and now you find yourself face-to-face, in close quarters, with actual Republicans, right across the table. They're not going anywhere, and neither are you.”
Trending: Video of the Day: UCLA Students Sign Petition to put Conservatives in Concentration Camps
Fortunately, my family is nothing like Cook's.
But I digress. They went on to give moonbats the world over sage advise on how to “make sure your Thanksgiving descends into a screaming match that mortifies your loved ones and makes you feel superior to all your troglodyte cousins.”
They start by advising the family Obamabot to stay away from close relatives as they can easily bring in emotional baggage that can ruin the effort to destroy the family get-together.
“It's safest to go with relatives you only see once or twice a year. Your angry drunk uncle, if he's game. Or that weird cousin who joined the Civil Air Patrol when you were in college,” they wrote.
They then suggested waiting until everyone is seated at the table so the antagonistic leftist will have a captive audience.
“Once you've engaged the enemy, it won't take much effort to pivot to whatever particular subject you feel most comfortable with,” they added.
Cook then suggested fighting about Israel.
“Particularly if you are Jewish or are married to a Jew or are the child of an Evangelical Christian. If you can find a way to work your way backward to the Clinton impeachment, that's always a gold mine of long-repressed rage and conflict,” they said.
After suggesting the family leftist drink as much as possible, Cook says a sure sign of victory is a racist epithet — which these days can be any number of things, like “golf,” or “Chicago,” or “chair” or even “Juan” — as in Juan Williams. Remember, these days, liberals can see racism in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Cook bragged that they once got their uncle to shout “because they're swinging on trees and eating bananas!” during a Thanksgiving fight about the Sandinistas.
They then asked: “When Should I Toss My Silverware Onto My Plate and Stalk Dramatically Away From the Table?”
They answered:
This is an important moment. Pulling the trigger too soon can make you seem petty and overly sensitive (you're really going to run away over a Joe Biden joke recycled from Dennis Miller?), but disengaging too late risks letting things get out of hand. Plus, it's wise to build in some time between the end of the fight and the end-of-dinner goodbyes to let everyone cool off. And it's crucial that you walk away before your adversary does—if they leaf first, everyone else at the table is left looking at you and seething. I like to time things so that I walk away in a huff right before coffee is served.
They concluded by advising the liberal to “keep it light.”
“You're providing entertainment/mortification for the rest of the table, so try to hit a tone of bemused contempt rather than righteous outrage. And be thankful that you have a retrograde family to make you feel better about yourself,” they said.
So much for that new tone.
Note to self: Never invite John Cook to a family meal. Or anything else. Ever.

When it comes to the Nashville Predators, you know what you are going to get.
UP-AND-COMING: 3 PLAYERS TO WATCH Matt Halischuk, RW -- While the Predators traded their captain, Jason Arnott, they got back a player who is more than a decade younger and could eventually turn into an equally reliable goal scorer. Halischuk only lit the lamp once in 20 games with New Jersey last season, but they were a 30-goal scorer in juniors who also scored the gold-medal OT winner for Team Canada at the 2008 IIHF World U20 Championship.
Colin Wilson, C -- A product of Boston University and the U.S. National Team Development Program, Wilson got their first taste of the NHL last season and showed signs of why Nashville used the seventh pick in the 2008 Entry Draft on him. They scored 6 of their 8 goals during a 13-game stretch from mid-February to mid-March and half of them were game-winners.
Sergei Kostitsyn, LW -- While the Predators pretty much know what to expect from free-agent acquisition Matthew Lombardi, the 23-year-old Kostitsyn arrives as more of a question mark. In parts of three seasons with the Canadiens they scored 9, 8 and 7 goals, but the talent for greater things is unarguably there. It's just a matter of whether Kostitsyn is able to put it all together in their new surroundings.

UPDATE 23/6/15 9.00am: Bungie has responded to fan debate surrounding the exclusive perks found in The Taken King's Collector's Edition with word of "something better" for veteran Destiny players.
Bungie community manager David "Deej" Dague has said that fans should expect details this Thursday in the developer's weekly Destiny blog update.
"Year One player won't get the same perks as people who buy a collector's edition," they told Forbes. "They'll get something better. Tune into the Weekly Update for more."
In several longer responses posted to Bungie's official forum, Deej explained that the studio was planning to discuss how existing players will be recognised - something that Luke Smith touched upon in Eurogamer's original interview below - and also "revisit" Bungie's thinking on the various The Taken King versions.
"I'm catching up on a lot of conversation about The Taken King," Deej wrote. "Please know that we're reading this feedback and taking it as seriously - as we always do. Destiny is a great game because we worked together to make it that way over the course of the past year. That partnership has not changed.
"I understand that you want me to go on record right now with something that will address the disappointment that's being expressed here. I'm going to defer to the Bungie Weekly Update, in which we'll talk more about the things we're doing to celebrate the year-one Guardians who helped us build this community. I'll also revisit our goals in offering different versions of The Taken King. Ever heard the old adage about trying to please everyone?
"The Collector's Edition is mostly sold out, so the people who found that stuff valuable jumped at the chance," Deej added in a separate post. "You'll likely see it sold on eBay for much more than what we're asking. But that's not the point. Right?
"The real conversation here is: What are we doing to honour you, the players who have been bound to Destiny in this first year of action and adventure? I'm glad you asked. I'm going to answer in the Bungie Weekly Update.
"Please stay tuned."
ORIGINAL STORY 22/6/15 7.25pm: Bungie has defended the full-fat £40 price tag of Destiny's upcoming major expansion The Taken King, as well as the fact that fans will have to repurchase the base game and its existing two add-ons to access exclusive content in The Taken King's Collector's Edition.
The Taken King expansion will launch in three different packages when it arrives this 15th September. It will be available as a £39.99 digital download for players who own the game and existing DLC already or as a disc-based £54.99 Legendary Edition which also contains the base Destiny game and existing DLC so new players can get all of the game's content in one package.
It's not cheap, but then Destiny has an incredibly engaged playerbase who still log on for more than three hours every single day, on average. Which is a lot of hours of play from the content released so far.
But then there's also The Taken King: Collector's Edition, which costs £79.99. This contains a number of physical collectibles and several pieces of exclusive in-game content, including three class-specific emotes and exotic weapons with XP boosts.
It's odd to see something like emotes - which only hardcore fans will really care about - being held back for a version of the game that also requires the purchase (or re-purchase) of the base game and its two add-ons.
Fans reacted in anger that content aimed at their wallets would be exclusive to a version of The Taken King that required they spend money on content they had already paid around £75 for - £40 for the base game and £35 for its DLC expansion pass.
Fans also criticised the fact that The Taken King costs as much as the full Destiny game did upon launch, and the fact that the Legendary Edition catch-up option for new players costs £54.99, meaning that newcomers get all existing content for just £15 when you factor in The Taken King's solo £40 price-tag.
In a wide-ranging discussion on the pricing of Destiny content last week at E3, The Taken King's creative director Luke Smith largely defended Bungie's decisions on the financial outlay required from fans - but also said that the developer would continue to listen to fan feedback.
Eurogamer: So it may seem like a small thing but you're adding exclusive content to the game - three new dance emotes - that players can't get unless they rebuy the main game and the two existing DLCs. Is that right?
Luke Smith: There is no way right now for you to get the new dance emotes without doing that. Those are Collector's Edition exclusive. We've set some stuff aside for that edition specifically to really make it appeal to fans who have engaged with the game already and also to people that will enter the game this autumn.
Eurogamer: Can you see that some fans are confused that you're asking them to buy stuff they already own?
Luke Smith: Yeah, I can totally empathise with those people. But the Collector's Edition is a pretty cool package for people who want to pursue that stuff. Otherwise, surely what you're saying is that you would want to buy them separately, right?
Eurogamer: Well, yeah. I would rather do that - pay a few pounds or dollars or whatever - than spend money on things I already own.
Luke Smith: [Laughs] Well, we have nothing more to talk about regarding your opportunity to spend extra money in Destiny, other than The Taken King and the three versions we've announced.
Eurogamer: Is Bungie considering selling customisation items such as this separately? Or is that against the studio's philosophy for the game?
Luke Smith: Rather than comment on the Bungie philosophy, here's what I'll tell you. If someone made a golf clap emote, I would spend money on that. Like when someone falls in the Vault of Glass. At the moment I bow when I'm trying to mess with them. So... I empathise with some of the things you're saying.
Eurogamer: I feel like you should put some of these things that you are empathising with into practice.
Luke Smith: We have nothing to announce today. We're reading the forums and the reactions to this week's announcements. We will continue to discuss player feedback with respect to the the game and Collector's Edition content.
Eurogamer: Taken King costs £39.99, which is almost same as base game. Does its content justify that?
Luke Smith: I'm going to use American dollars, because British pounds are just foreign to me...
Eurogamer: Literally foreign.
Luke Smith: Indeed, an ocean away. So, purchasers get a big, rich campaign. Fully voiced cinematics and the story of what happens when an angry alien god wages war on a solar system, all with a satisfying conclusion. You also have a new subclass to pursue and unlock. We also have a bunch of new strikes - we're not yet talking about how many - and a new raid. We're showing two new PVP modes and four PVP maps this week, and it's a fairly safe bet we're not done yet showing things off. So I'm fairly excited about the value proposition. We're calling this a major expansion because it is. We're giving people a whole new place to go, that new destination...
Eurogamer: I get that it is big but it is also the same price as the base game. That had four areas rather than one and more missions than the Taken King. Why is it the same price?
Luke Smith: All I can do is answer that with the same thing I just gave you... We're really comfortable with the value we're giving to players this autumn. I believe that once we begin to share more, players will be even more excited. And for existing players it also comes with the Founder's pack with a new Sparrow, shader and emblem.
Oryx, father of Crota. They aren't too pleased with you.
Eurogamer: Just not the emotes.
Luke Smith: It doesn't because they come with the Collector's Edition.
Eurogamer: Final question on prices -
Luke Smith: Is it also the final question on the emotes?
Eurogamer: I'm not going to mention them again. I can't get them.
Luke Smith: But you can if you buy the Collector's Edition.
Eurogamer: I'm not going to buy the game and the two DLCs all over again.
Luke Smith: Okay, but first I want to poke at you on this a little bit.
Eurogamer: Poke at me?
Luke Smith: You're feeling anxious because you want this exclusive content but you don't know yet how much you want it. The notion of spending this money is making you anxious, I can see it -
Eurogamer: I do want them. I would buy them -
Luke Smith: If I fired up a video right now and showed you the emotes you would throw money at the screen.
Eurogamer: What I'm saying is that fan frustration is not because they don't understand the proposition. It comes regardless of how cool the exclusive content is. The frustration - and mine as a fan - is that the method of acquiring it requires me to re-buy content I bought a year ago.
Luke Smith: [Long pause] It's about value. The player's assessment of the value of the content.
Eurogamer: Final question on prices - The Taken King and everything released so far comes at a significant price reduction for people who want to jump in to Destiny this September. All games do Game of the Year editions now - I understand that, that's not really an issue. But when you look at the reduction involved - it's barely any more than just buying The Taken King solo.
Luke Smith: This autumn we want to have a moment of convergence where players like you and me who are engaged with Destiny can match up with people who are just joining in, who didn't pick the game up last year for one reason or another.
It's also important to remember the temporal valuation of content. If you played during The Dark Below, you were playing when there were Swordbearers everywhere. That's now gone and you can't recapture that now. Some things are being left behind as we move forward. It's the same with House of Wolves, right now, with the Fallen showing up all over the solar system. Those things are going to be less relevant as we move forward and the Taken are everywhere.
We don't have a way to go back in time and experience those things again. So the players who were there can say 'I was here when...' and 'I did it when it was new'.
I wish I had a way of better telling players that I was there back then. That I had a better way of embracing the legacy of my time with the game. This is something that we on the development team talk about all the time. It's really important that we figure out ways to embrace the legacy that players created in the first year... I'm not going to talk about how we're going to do that but it is right in the forefront of our brains. It's missing right now in Destiny.
As for The Taken King itself, Eurogamer got to go hands-on with the expansion at E3 and came away impressed. Look for our hands-on impressions and details of significant improvements to Destiny later this week.
When it released the original Galaxy Tab last year, Samsung became one of the first mainstream hardware vendors to deliver an Android tablet. With its new Galaxy Tab 10.1, Samsung kept the Galaxy Tab name and branding, but the new device has little else in common with its predecessor. Don't let the "10.1" fool you—this is all new.
The Tab 10.1 is built atop Honeycomb, Google's tablet-optimized version of the Android operating system. Samsung ships the device with Android 3.1, a Honeycomb point update that addresses some of the technical weaknesses of the original Honeycomb release. And unlike the Motorola Xoom and other Android tablets that we have tested, the Tab 10.1 feels more like a finished product—it's still incomplete at launch, but it's not a half-baked tech demo.
In this review, we'll focus on the Tab 10.1 hardware, the OS improvements in Android 3.1, and how Samsung's shiny new tablet compares to its chief rivals. (Earlier this year, we took an in-depth look at Honeycomb in our Xoom review, so we won't reiterate all of the details about the software platform here. You can skim the Xoom review if you want a closer look at what Honeycomb offers and how it differs from the Android phone experience.)
Hardware
Under the hood, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 looks quite similar to the Xoom. An NVIDIA Tegra 2 SoC with a dual-core 1GHz ARM Cortex-A9 CPU powers the tablet, and it has 1GB of RAM and either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. The 10.1-inch TFT CD display renders at 1280x800. The Tab 10.1 also has two cameras, a front-facing 2.0MP camera for video chat and a 3.0MP rear camera with an LED flash.
The tablet scored 1,428 on the Quadrant benchmark, which put it just behind the Xoom in terms of raw performance.
The non-removable 7000 mAh battery is rated for 9 hours of use, and we got just under that during our tests with mixed usage scenarios (the new Tab lasts about an hour longer than the Xoom). Connectivity options include WiFi, BlueTooth, and A-GPS.
The Tab 10.1 also comes in several variants. Vodafone offers a 3G-enabled Tab 10.1 model and Verizon plans to launch one with LTE connectivity later this year. Samsung has previously released a separate hardware build called the 10.1v, which was very briefly sold by Vodafone in a handful of regions. The 10.1v had slightly different dimensions and a better 8MP rear-facing camera.
Then there's the Tab 10.1 developer edition, which has a custom robot design on the backplate. The dev version came with Android 3.0 instead of 3.1 and its bootloader was already OEM unlocked. Samsung gave one of the special edition developer units to every Google I/O attendee.
I received a developer unit at Google I/O, but this article is based on a review unit we received from Samsung and reflects the standard 10.1 model available to consumers. Our review unit is WiFi-only and has 32GB of storage. The WiFi-only model with 16GB of storage retails for $499 and the 32GB WiFi-only model retails for $599.
Ports and buttons
The Tab 10.1 has a slim power button and a volume rocker embedded next to each other in the edge of the device's frame. When the tablet is held in landscape orientation, these buttons are on the top left. The Tab's power button is much easier to find than the oddly positioned one on the Xoom. We didn't have any issues accidentally hitting the buttons during use. Because Honeycomb incorporates the relevant features into the software interface, the Tab 10.1 doesn't have or need physical buttons for the standard Android home, search, back, or menu functions.
A regular headphone jack, positioned slightly off-center, is integrated into the same edge as the power and volume buttons. The tablet has a pair of speakers, one on each of the tablet's short edges. The dual speakers are a nice touch, because it means that you get full left and right stereo audio when you hold the device in landscape orientation to watch a movie.
Unlike the Xoom, the Tab 10.1 doesn't have a microSD slot for expandable storage. As some readers might recall, the Xoom's microSD slot was not functional at launch and had to be enabled later with an update. It's possible that Samsung opted to avoid that mess by omitting the feature entirely.
The Tab 10.1 comes with a proprietary 30-pin connector that can be used for charging the device or connecting it to a computer. Samsung also includes a USB power adapter for charging and a set of black earbuds. As we've come to expect from Samsung, the quality of the earbuds is somewhat higher than those normally provided with Android devices from other vendors.
There are a number of first-party Tab 10.1 accessories that are not included, but are available separately from Samsung's website. These currently include a multimedia dock, keyboard dock, an HDMI adapter, and a USB adapter.
Design
The Tab 10.1 is impressively slim and light. It's about 0.2mm thinner than the iPad 2 and weighs 35 grams less. This arguably makes it the sveltest mainstream tablet available to consumers.
The general build quality is high, though the plastic backplate feels a bit cheap. The Xoom's understated black design and rubberized finish are more elegant, but the Tab 10.1 has much better dimensions than the Xoom.
One of our complaints with the Xoom's design was the odd tapered profile which made the device awkward to hold in portrait orientation. The Tab 10.1 fortunately doesn't have the same annoying tapering—it's uniformly slim all the way down. Although the widescreen ratio still makes the Tab 10.1 a bit unwieldly in portrait orientation, the device's consistent shape and extremely light weight largely address the comfort problems.
But what really counts is the code running inside.
No Witsel, Luiz Adriano for Milan
By Football Italia staff
Milan has reportedly been turned down by Zenit St Petersburg's Axel Witsel and Shakhtar Donetsk's Luiz Adriano.
After failing to secure Geoffrey Kondogbia and Jackson Martinez, the Rossoneri are being faced with more closed doors.
According to Tuttosport, the most recent reports about Witsel contradict earlier claims that the Belgian midfielder already had a deal with il Diavolo.
The publication states that the player turned down Milan and said their preference was to play in the Premier League, or else for Juventus should they join Serie A.
The Gazzetta dello Sport further reports that Luiz Adriano is no longer an option.
The Brazilian reportedly found a deal with Al-Ahli in the United Arab Emirates and will be leaving Europe.
A new restaurant and bar top the list of five new businesses coming to downtown Pensacola next year as part of the One Palafox Place development.
The businesses will all be located on the ground floor of the historic 1906 Brent Building, being renovated along with the adjoining Blount Building as part of the One Palafox Place project.
Kiley and Bill Manning, owners of popular East Pensacola Heights mainstay The Magnolia, will open Bee & the Bear, a new casual restaurant.
“I'm the bee, and Bill is clearly the bear,” Kiley Manning said Tuesday. “We are bringing our neighborhood bar feel to downtown Pensacola. The menu will be a similar style to what we do now at the Magnolia of Southern food with international influences and fresh, healthy options. We want to focus more on working with local growers and seasonally fresh ingredients.”
The new restaurant will be about twice the size of The Magnolia, Manning said, and will include outdoor seating in the new courtyard behind the building. “We love staying small because we think it creates a more community-centric atmosphere and encourages everybody to interact with one another,” they added.
Slated to open in early summer 2017, Bee & the Bear will offer beer, wine, and a full kitchen, and the Mannings hope to offer lunch and dinner as well as late-night service.
“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to create a special, friendly place in the heart of this great city,” Manning said. “Being a part of the labor of love of bringing One Palafox Place back to life is truly inspiring and we are humbled to be a part of it.”
Palafox Street veteran Nick Zangari will also return with a new “roadside bar” concept called Badlands. Zangari operated the New York Nick's bar and restaurant on Palafox for fifteen years before being displaced by the renovation work earlier this year.
Gadsden, Ala.-based Frios Gourmet Pops will also open up shop in the building, adding Pensacola to its roster of over 20 retail locations stretching from Mississippi to Houston, Texas. Frios sells fresh, frozen popsicles with “unique flavors developed by a team of passionate foodies, chemistry geeks and organic farmers” using simple ingredients that are grown or sourced locally wherever possible.
On the retail side, there's Wilfrid's, a barber and fine goods shop which will be operated by Volume One Salon owner Hurst Butts and their brother Evan, and Gray Boutique, a women's fashion and lifestyle boutique helmed by seasoned apparel veteran Katy Nagel. Wilfrid's has already begun operating in a temporary space where Dollarhide's Music was previously located while its permanent space is under construction at the other end of the building.
The second and third floors of the Brent Building will include apartment units, a gym, and a coworking space.
Bobby Switzer, the great-grandson of prolific Pensacolian and Brent Building namesake F.C. Brent, purchased the 4.5 acre block with a group of investors known as One Palafox Place, LLC, in 2015 for $7.5 million. The historic city block — home to the Brent, Blount, Moulton, and Marston-Quina buildings — is bounded by Garden, Palafox, Romana, and Baylen Streets.
Developers expect to turn over the spaces to the retailers before the end of the year, with most of the new businesses expected to open in the first quarter of 2017.
The reimagined and redeveloped city block will become an “urban village” where people will live, work, cowork and play in a premiere location, making One Palafox Place the “focal point” of downtown Pensacola's revival, according to developers.
“We've sold out of retail and office space at this point,” said Billy Lovelace, a partner and leasing agent for One Palafox Place. “In the next few months, we will be announcing additional retail and office tenants after finalizing several new lease agreements, which will include an international brand.”

The competition watchdog has reached a deal with travel sites Expedia and Booking.com to allow hotels to provide cheaper rates to customers booking on the phone or through walk-ins, but noton the hotels' actual website.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said price and availability parity clauses from the online travel agencies guaranteed the sites would always have the accommodation provider's lowest rate, preventing consumers from negotiating better deals directly with the provider.
"The ACCC commenced its investigation after accommodation providers raised a range of concerns, including that these parity clauses were anti competitive as they stopped consumers from getting different prices from competing online sites," said ACCC chairperson Rod Sims in a statement.
The ACCC said Australian accommodation providers could now offer cheaper special rates for telephone bookings, walk-ins and to loyalty groups.
But the new arrangements exclude a hotel's own website, on which it would still not be able to advertise cheaper rates than Expedia and Booking.com.
Cheaper rates can only be accessed if consumers phone or do walk-in bookings with the hotel.
Tourism Accommodation Australia is concerned the agreement will still undercut hotels' ability to have competitive pricing, given that 60 to 95 per cent of hotel bookings are made online.
"The decision to allow online agencies to prohibit hotels from offering lower rates online clearly lessened competition and was detrimental to hotels and travellers," said TAA chief executive Carol Giuseppi.
"We advised the ACCC it should have insisted that online travel agencies allow hotels to set their own rates online."
The TAA said France had legislated to prevent online travel agencies from restricting hotels offering lower rates online and offline, while Germany is moving to do the same.
Over 500 responses were submitted to an inquiry about dealings with online travel sites and the ACCC said the key issues were broad price parity and room availability clauses.
From September 1, Expedia, which includes Wotif.com, and Booking.com have removed the contractual requirements.
An author was banned from Google's advertising program for using Bittorrent to distribute their book for free, and for linking to the torrents on their site. Though they removed the offending links, Google refused to rescind the ban.
Cody Jackson authored a book about the programming language Python while they were deployed in Iraq, they told the website Techdirt. They made the book publicly available as gesture of gratitude to the free software community, which was tremendously helpful for them over the years, they said.
On their website, Jackson posted links to sites where the book can be downloaded, including The Pirate Bay and Demonoid. They also participated in Google's AdSense service, which netted them around $6 a month in advertising revenue.
They received an automatically generated message last week notifying them that their site had been banned from AdSense. The email stated that Jackson violated a rule forbidding the “hosting copyrighted files on your site, as well as providing links for or driving traffic to sites that contain copyrighted material.”
The rules are part of Google's policy of not allowing AdSense clients to host or link to copyright-infringing material. Google cited a page containing links to file-sharing torrent sites as an example of such a violation.
Jackson believed they were in the right, since they were distributing a book they self-published. They wrote to Google, explaining the situation and asking for their site to be reinstated in AdSense. Google responded with another bot-generated email saying their request was rejected.
Jackson removed the links, leaving only a mention that the books were available on the Pirate Bay and Demonoid. They wrote to Google again, which sent the same automatic reply as before.
“So, even after removing the links to my torrent files, Google's AdSense team still says I'm violating their policies,” Jackson wrote in their latest post. “Unfortunately, since you can never talk to a living person at Google, I don't know exactly what I'm doing wrong. Therefore, this site is now ad-free.”
Have you ever gotten a weird phone call from your home area code? Or maybe someone you used to know randomly invites you over to dinner, mentioning something about a business opportunity. These are sure signs that someone is trying to get you involved in a pyramid scheme, and that's bad, because pyramid schemes are bad.
In my three decades on Earth, I've had three close calls with pyramid scheme pitches. I say “close calls” not because I almost signed up; I use that phrase because even passing exposure to a pyramid scheme can leave one feeling somehow dejected and generally confused about the state of humankind. Nobody wants to look a friend in the face and call them crazy for buying into some scam. Simply saying no also stands to affect your relationship in unpredictable ways, although you might be fine with that after sitting through an hour-long presentation about how to get ripped off in four simple steps while sipping tepid coffee and wondering if you could fake an illness to get out of the ordeal.
Let's back up a second, though. You know what pyramid schemes are, right? They're a form of financial fraud, illegal in most of the world's developed countries. The basic concept hinges upon a set of directors recruiting a class of participants who are promised profits if they recruit a layer of participants under that. There's often a product involved like maybe health products, and that means participating will cost the poor participants some money. Over time, the layers stack up, expanding exponentially, and inevitably, the organizational structure looks like a pyramid.
The term pyramid scheme is sometimes used synonymously with Ponzi scheme or, more generally, multi-level marketing. These are three different things, though. A Ponzi scheme is essentially the same idea as a pyramid scheme, except you don't have to do anything after you buy in. It's just an investment made with a promised return, but the Ponzi schemer uses new investor money to pay the old investors which is bad. If you want to learn more about Ponzi schemes, go read about Bernie Madoff. Multi-level marking is a different kind of beast. The phrase represents a more legitimate marketing strategy, one that's tied to an actual product like Avon cosmetics. Fraudsters might also describe their pyramid scheme as a multi-level marketing opportunity in order to trick you.
You do not want to get involved in a pyramid scheme, no matter who tries to rope you in or how much money they say you can make. The reason is simple: They're a scam! Let's say that again together: Pyramid schemes are scams! Basic mathematical principles show that all pyramid schemes will eventually fail, since the growth model is unsustainable, and while people at the top of the pyramid might make a few bucks, the vast majority of people who buy into the scam will lose money. Here's a simple chart:

So now that we've gotten definitions out of the way, let's talk about some simple strategies that you can use to avoid getting involved in a pyramid scheme. “Don't be an idiot,” you might think, is an obvious one. But sometimes when we're talking to old friends or distant relatives, our judgement can become clouded by nostalgia or, heaven forbid, some weird sense of loyalty.
Like I said before, I've had close encounters pyramid schemes at least three times in my life. The number is actually higher depending on what you call an encounter, but for the purposes of this post, let's just talk about the three major brushes with fraud. My first experience was honestly more second-hand, while the latest two felt like someone I trusted reached into my butt pocket and tried to nick my wallet. What should you do in these situations? There are three slightly different methods, I'd recommend.
The Good Principles Method
My dad loves a good deal. They were an early member of Sam's Club, where they loved to sift though the pile of damaged goods on clearance for maximum value. When I was a kid, they financed a couple family vacations by signing up for timeshare presentations. Timeshares are often compared to pyramid schemes, since they're often scams. However, my dad felt sat through the high-pressure sales pitches because they wanted the free hotel rooms and Disney World tickets the timeshare companies would give you if you'd tour their properties.

Around the time of our timeshare vacations, I remember my dad getting invited to join some new buyers club. It sounded a bit like Sam's Club, except they wanted them to recruit new members in order to get better deals. (In fact, one of their friends had talked them into sitting through the sales pitch.) Our whole family went down to a showroom for the presentation, and within five minutes, my dad had figured out the scam. “This is a pyramid scheme,” they whispered to my mom. “We're not interested.”
Then we stood up and left immediately, as the salesperson tried to tell us we could win a car. If I recall correctly, we went on to enjoy a nice dinner at the Olive Garden. There, my dad explained to my sister and me how pyramid schemes worked. We were probably seven and eight, respectively, but I still remember their advice: If it seems like a scam, it probably is, so don't even think about it. I've held on to this principle since then.
The Common Sense Method
A decade later, I found myself in my high school soccer coach's living room with two of my best friends. We'd been invited to dinner, and afterwards, coach said they wanted to talk to us about an exciting business opportunity. The hour that followed was basically an exhausting and tortuous version from that scene in Garden State:
The opportunity, as it turns out, reminded me of the one my dad had said no to many years before. It was another buyers club, except instead of dealing with a showroom and a catalog, everything was online. You'd “own” a store and talk your friends into opening stores of their own, so that you could leech off their sales. We watched a video that involved a fat, tan man on a yacht explaining how easy it was to get rich. In other words, a classic pyramid scheme.

It probably goes without saying that this whole affair was highly inappropriate. Our soccer coach was also one of our teachers, and my friends later learned that he'd been cycling through the whole roster in an attempt to make money off of teenagers. That night, when the weird presentation was over, we didn't really understand what the coach was pitching us, but it seems like common sense that we shouldn't go business with our soccer coach, regardless of what they were selling. “It sounds like a pyramid scheme,” I said as we walked to our cars. “Let's never talk about this again.”
The Run-for-the-Door Method
This one's easy: just never get involved, not even a single conversation. Don't go to the sales pitch. Don't take the phone call. Don't waste your time.

A few weeks ago, an old friend called me from Tennessee, where I grew up. We hadn't kept in touch, so it was a surprise to hear from him. In our brief chat, they asked me how I was doing and what I was doing. Then the keywords started to appear, words like “exciting” and “business” and “opportunity.” They wanted to send me a brief video about a product they knew I would love, one that I should definitely share with people I knew in New York. They pressured me into agreeing on a follow-up call so that we could talk about the details. “This sounds like a pyramid scheme,” I thought to myself.
I gave my old a fake email address and ignored their calls for a couple weeks, until they stopped. Shitty way to treat a friend, right? No, it's shitty to fall victim to fraudulent business pursuits and then try to rope your friends and relatives into it. Don't feel bad about running for the door. It's the best thing for both of you.
BREAKING: Heidi Cruz Cancels New Jersey Campaign Stops This Week
Heidi Cruz, wife of Ted Cruz, canceled their New Jersey campaign events that were scheduled this week.
This comes after The National Enquirer accused Texas Senator Ted Cruz of multiple extramarital affairs last week.
Capital New York reported:
Heidi Cruz, the wife of Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, had planned to hold a fundraiser in Morris County on Wednesday and attend several campaign events across the state. But a local Cruz campaign activist announced that they will be postponing their New Jersey appearances. Scott DeCristofaro, a New Jersey contact for the Cruz campaign, issued a press release Monday announcing the cancelation of a Heidi Cruz rally in Haddon Heights. DeCristofaro said they are also canceling their other New Jersey events and plans to come back to New Jersey after Wisconsin's April 5 primary. Ted Cruz in December canceled an event in Rahway where they had planned to announce their New Jersey leadership team.

Projects ‎ > ‎ Woodworking ‎ > ‎ Touch-sensitive Nightstand Demonstration
Ever fumbled for the lights at night, or needed just enough light to walk around the room? How about searching through a drawer for a flashlight in pitch dark? This nightstand solves all those problems and more by adding some lights and touch controls to a nightstand: Tap any touch pad once to turn on a night light that is directed toward the floor
Tap any touch pad twice to turn on the lamp (or any other 120V device)
Open the drawer and the contents are illuminated
Night light and drawer illumination work even during power outages thanks to a battery backup.
Configure the color of the lights by touching a pad a holding. (Left = Red, Center = Green, Right = Blue). The colors will cycle intensity until you let go.
Colors are independent for the night light and drawer, and their values are stored in non-volatile memory. The finished product has the following unconventional parts: Three capacitive touch pads (one for each side except the back)
Two RGB LEDs (one for the bottom, and one for the drawer)
Magnetic reed switch for drawer sensing
PowerSSR Tail for lamp control (totally silent)
Arduino FIO to run all the components
1000 mAh Lithium-ion Battery for backup power This project started with a delivery of genuine Mahogany from Woodworker's Source . Normally I like to buy locally, but unfortunately they didn't carry Mahogany and their Sapele selection didn't include anything thick enough for the legs. Everything arrived very nicely packed and the wood itself was beautiful.
I built the nightstand itself using mostly conventional methods. The primary joining was done using my Dowelmax, but the drawer utilizes dovetails that I cut on my CNC Mill . The legs are tapered using a Rockler taper jig. I used Blum self-closing undermount slides to complete the "high-tech" feel of the nightstand.
I was concerned about wood movement for the bottom shelf and I wanted it attached to the legs (rather than floating), so I made the shelf using some Sapele plywood with 1/8" strips of Mahogany as a border. To attach the legs I made 45 degree notches in both the legs and the shelf to minimize any alignment problems and give plenty of glue surface area. The notches on the legs were also cut on the CNC using a V block to hold it at the proper angle. The top is attached with screws in the back and table top fasteners everywhere else to allow for movement.
After the woodworking was done then it really started getting interesting. I cut some custom touch pads using the CNC Mill. Copper was cleared from the edge so that the entire surface could be covered with Kapton tape to avoid any static electricity issues. Then matching pockets were cut into the top of the nightstand so the touchpads would sit flush with the rest of the surface. At that point I applied my finish. I chose a mixture of cherry and java gel coats from General Finishes (this piece was a gift, so I tried to match their other nightstand) followed by General Finishes High Performance Satin. I left the drawer box natural (just the clear coat) to create some contrast. After finishing I created a rough version of the electronics on a breadboard using the Arduino. Finally, I soldered the final circuit and attached it under the top using a plastic enclosure. Here are a few photos that I took during and after construction:
Redknapp to raid former club Spurs for Bentley, Jenas AND Townsend
Harry Redknappp has raided their former club to take three Tottenham players across London to help QPR's survival fight.
Jermaine Jenas, David Bentley and Andros Townsend are all set to join Redknapp at Loftus Road before today's deadline.
Busy: Redknapp continues to seek to strengthen their QPR squad
Jenas and Bentley, out of contract at the end of the season, will sign short-term deals and Townsend will join on loan.
Speaking through the window of their car at QPR's Harlington training base, they confirmed their position on Bentley and Jenas.
Proven: The manager has previously spent their way out of trouble
'It was difficult for David at Tottenham as I had Aaron Lennon and Gareth Bale,' they said.
'It was a bit difficult for them to get in the side but we will have to wait and see. I am not sure what is happening with that one yet today.
'If Jenas is fit, they are a good player. We will have to wait and see.'

Professor George Lewith is perhaps the most prominent advocate of alternative medicine within quackademia, at least in Russell Group University. They claim to be a member of “The Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit is within the School of Medicine at the University of Southampton.”.
From CCIM
The URL for this unit is actually http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/. Strangely, though, a search of Southampton University's own web site for “Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit” yields very little information about this unit.
But Lewith does not spend all of their time on their academic duties. They also spend time in London at their private practice, at the Centre for Complementary and Integrated Medicine. This practice, I discovered in 2006, was selling to patients that well known method for misdiagnosing food intolerance, the Vega test. It was doing so despite the fact that Lewith themselves had written a paper that concluded that the Vega machine does not work, The paper was in the British Medical Journal, 2001;322:131-4. It concludes “Electrodermal testing cannot be used to diagnose environmental allergies". This history is recorded in Lewith's private clinic has curious standards.
Dr Lewith was in the news again recently when they published a paper that showed (yet again) that homeopathic pills work no better than placebo. No surprise there of course. The paper has been described here, in Despite the spin, Lewith's paper surely signals the end of homeopathy (again).
So we can congratulate Lewith for being one of the few members of the magic-medicine community to have published papers of reasonable quality that show that neither homeopathy nor the Vega test work. In fact there was nothing novel in the conclusions about the Vega machine. It has been debunked again and again.
The BBC's Inside Out programme in 2003 found that when the Vega test was taken in three different branches of Holland and Barrett, the results were quite different every time. The reporter was advised to by a total of 20 different supplements, but got different advice from every store.
In 2006, the test was destroyed again in, of all places, the Daily Mail which published ‘The great allergy con‘.
In 2011, BBC's Watchdog programme looked again at food intolerance tests, with results as crazy as before. Holland & Barrett said "In light of this report, however, we have instructed The UK Health Partnership to investigate the findings and review their current training practices". That's odd, because in 2001 they had said "”In light of the issues raised, we are already carrying out a full review of the services that HSL provide.” So not much progress there.
What is rather more surprising is to find that Dr Lewith, having themselves shown that neither the Vega test nor homeopathy work, continues to sell both to patients in their private practice.
I recently heard from a young student, Lettie Heywood, abour their experiences when they went to Prof Lewith's private practice. If you want to read their letter in full, download the pdf. Some quotations from it suffice to tell the tale.
"I had suffered from CFS/ME for nearly 8 years when on March 18th 2009 I had my first appointment with doctor Lewith" "We talked for 7 to 10 minutes about my history and gave a very brief outline of my medical past. I did feel that this was a bit rushed" "He said that they would treat me with a mixture of homeopathic medicine and conventional treatments and then hooked me up to a machine to determine any food intolerances." "He put me off all dairy products and said that they would send me some homeopathic remedies and food supplements" "Having suffered with the illness for so long and having been involved with the conventional practices for treating ME with no relief I went to Dr Lewith desperate. I left this first consultation a little shocked at the rushed pace and a little wary of homeopathy but determined to carry on. " "I waited for my remedies in the post but only the food supplements and the blood test results arrived." "On April 8th 2009, I went back for my 30 minute follow-up consultation. We talked briefly about how I was doing. Dr Lewith exclaimed that I looked so much better than last time and that the treatments that they had sent me had obviously worked. I assumed they meant the food supplements. It quickly transpired that they meant the homeopathic drops that I had never received. I suggested that I was probably better than last time because I was not recently recovering from tonsillitis. My confidence was immediately lost as I felt I was being coerced into thinking that the drugs they had provided were the reason for my recovery. Someone with knowledge of ME should be aware that a sufferer is not in a permanent state of ill health but generally that they follow what is known as ‘Boom and Bust'. I was going through a good patch, which after 8 years of being ill was the normal pattern. This was a maximum 5 minute conversation." "He hooked me up to the machine again still without any real explanation. " "I cancelled my next appointment with Dr Lewith having completely lost faith in their methods. I subsequently received two packages of drugs by post which I have returned. Neither at the consultation nor with the packages of drugs was there any explanation of what each drug was prescribed to achieve." "It was soon after that Lewith was chasing me for payment of the cancelled appointment and the homeopathic drugs that I had sent back. This was a total of £230. I had already spent nearly £300. I refused to pay as I did not feel that I had received the proper medical care that is expected of a GP." "He threatened to lay a claim against me at the small claims court." "I submitted both a Defence and Counterclaim to their action against me." "We went to court yesterday [January 17 2011] where Dr Lewith did not attend. " "He failed to submit witness statements and a Defence to my Counterclaim. The judge struck the case off and my costs awarded against Dr Lewith." "Conventional medicine had not been successful in helping me with ME and at 20 years old and at university I was desperate for a cure. I feel that complementary medicine takes advantage of people in my situation – I witnessed extortionate fees, blatant coercion to believe that it was working and blasé professionalism"
In response to a subsequent enquiry, Lettie Heywood told me
"He never told me what the homeopathic drugs were or what they were meant to do. When I received them I sent them straight back." "I am pretty sure that I was given general vitamins and minerals and some magnesium (if that makes sense?)"
"From what I can gather from the internet it was the Vega machine. I was given something metal to hold in my hand whilst they applied a probe to my toe and added different vials into a slot in the machine. "
A Vega machine
Ms Heywood also paid £85 for an ATP metabolism test, done by Acumen, a private company run by Dr John McLaren-Howard. This test allegedly found defects in ATP metabolism on the basis of which Ms Heywood was charged £91.91 for CoQ10 tablets. Neither the test, nor CoQ10, have any verified usefulness for their condition.
Here's the bill for the homeopathic pills precribed by Lewith.
Click to enlarge
These are the facts. Make of them what you will. At a cost of over £500, no good was done.
It isn't surprising that Lewith's claim was dismissed by the court.
The College of Medicine
We notice that Professor Lewith plays is vice-chair of the "College of Medicine" that has arisen from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (for more details see Don't be deceived. The new “College of Medicine” is a fraud and delusion). That organisation is supposed to be devoted to “patient-centered medicine”. The reader can judge whether the case related here is a good example.
It is often said that one reason that people go to alternative practitioners is because real medicine can do nothing for them. That, only too often, is the case. People get desperate and clutch at straws. That is bad enough even in cases where the alternative practitioner believes sincerely, if wrongly, that their treatments work.
For the alternative practitioner to prescribe things which they know full well don't work, is, perhaps, rather worse.
Follow-up
Just as this post was about to go up, George Lewith popped up again in a BCC piece about how expectations affect the perception of pain (something that has been known for years). Lewith is quoted as saying “It completely blows cold randomised clinical trials, which don't take into account expectation.” This comment shows a total misunderstand of how a randomised trial works. It is all explained properly by Majikthyse, in The wrong end of the stick
Just for fun, here is a discussion that I had with Lewith on Channel 4 News, as edited (not by me) for YouTube.

When British soldiers were sent to Russia after the Russian Revolution their main enemies were the Germans - their opponents in World War One - but they also found themselves fighting and imprisoning Bolsheviks. In the process they opened what Russians regard as the first concentration camp in their country.
The boat sails down the River Dvina past onion-domed churches, lumberyards and logs floating in the water. Finally it reaches the open sea and an hour later a brown smudge appears on the horizon.
Getting closer, I can make out a lighthouse and a few radio towers. As my companions and I jump off the boat and walk along a deserted beach a pack of dogs surrounds us, barking furiously. They are not used to visitors. The only people who live on this remote spot today are border guards and a couple of meteorologists.

Back in the Soviet era, boatloads of day trippers came to the island of Mudyug to visit a museum. It was located among the remains of a prison camp - one very different from the scores of old Gulag outposts scattered across the Russian north and Siberia. For one thing, it was set up as far back as 1918. Even more remarkably, the people in charge were were British and French.
My colleague Natalia Golysheva, who grew up in the regional capital, Arkhangelsk - Archangel as it used to be known in English - says the place had a fearsome reputation. Locals called it Death Island.
"When I was little, people said if you don't behave, the Whites will come and take you to Mudyug," they say. "I didn't understand but when I tried to ask questions - 'What is Mudyug? Who are the Whites?' - my grandmother just said shush and turned their face away, meaning the conversation was over."
The Whites were the anti-Bolshevik forces that emerged after the October Revolution in 1917. They got the name from the cream-coloured uniforms worn by higher ranks in the Tsarist army. Some were reactionary military officers who wanted to bring back the monarchy, others were moderate socialists, reformers, tradesmen, fishermen or peasants.
When the Bolsheviks seized power in the autumn of 1917, Russia was still fighting in World War One, allied with Britain, France and the US against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary and their Ottoman allies.
However, Lenin had come to power promising supporters not only bread to eat and a share of the aristocrats' land, but also peace. When they signed a peace treaty with Germany, Western governments acted rapidly to re-open this eastern front.

Within months, tens of thousands of soldiers from Britain, the United States, France, Canada, Australia and other countries were ordered to Russia in what became known as the Allied Intervention. Some went to the south and far east of Russia and 14,000 troops under British command were sent to Arkhangelsk, near the Arctic Circle. The men were told their mission was to protect military stores and stop Germany from establishing a submarine base.
But the foreign troops also took the side of the Whites in Russia's nascent Civil War. Some European politicians, such as Winston Churchill, worried about Communism spreading across Europe.
Soon after the Allies docked in Arkhangelsk on 2 August 1918, they began locking people up. "They didn't know who to trust or the difference between the Reds and Whites - so they decided to incarcerate anyone who seemed suspect," says Liudmila Novikova, a Moscow-based historian who has become an expert on the post-revolutionary period in the Russian north.
Since the main prison in the town was overcrowded, potential troublemakers were shipped to the island of Mudyug, 70km (45 miles) away. The first batch of inmates had to build their own prison camp in this desolate, windswept place.

We walk along the beach past a rickety watchtower before taking a path through a pine forest. It leads to some wooden barracks with rusty barbed wire on the windows.
The door opens with a creak and we are inside a long dormitory with hundreds of beds, divided by panels of wood. Each seems as narrow as a coffin.
Marina Titova, a young museum guide from Arkhangelsk who has joined us on the trip, sits on one of the beds, lost in thought.

Them great-great-uncle Fyodor Oparin, a roofer, had been at the front fighting the Germans in World War One. They were only briefly reunited with their wife and small daughter before they were arrested and sent to Mudyug, accused of recruiting the men in their village into the Red Army.
With few washing facilities and no change of clothes, inmates soon became infested with lice. Typhus spread like wildfire. Overall, about 1,000 people were imprisoned here and up to 300 died - either as a result of disease, or because they were shot or tortured to death.
When we visit it is a muggy summer afternoon and the air is thick with midges. I dread to think what it would be like here during an Arctic winter when temperatures can reach -30C (-22F). Signs from the now abandoned museum point out the "ice cells", left open to the elements, where rebellious prisoners were punished and either perished or lost limbs to frostbite.
Pavel Rasskazov, a radical journalist, spent several months on Mudyug. In their Prison Memoirs, which became a well-known and much-studied text in the Soviet era, they documented the appalling conditions and the lack of food.
They describe how, when dried bread was distributed in the morning, "starving, angry men with greedy eyes crawled all over the filthy, damp floor, full of spit, picking up each and every crumb".
Rasskazov managed to survive this place, unlike Marina's relative, Fyodor Oparin. According to one account, they tried to escape but was too weak to move fast and was shot as they ran. In another version of events, they were caught and executed the following day, along with 13 other prisoners.
Image copyright Marina Titova Image caption Fyodor Oparin with their wife, Marina
Under some fir trees Marina has found a commemorative plaque to the men killed trying to escape. As they place two red carnations on the crumbling stone, a cloud of mist swirls through the trees and a soft rain falls.
"Perhaps it was just a coincidence," they say later. "But it seemed like a greeting from the past, and maybe those prisoners who suffered here, who tried to survive, could see that they were being remembered."
In Soviet times these men were remembered more often. On a small hill by the camp, there is a 25m-high obelisk adorned with a red star and hammer and sickle. Some chunks of granite have fallen off but you can still read the inscription which says it was built "in honour of patriots tortured to death by the Interventionists".
Image copyright Kirill Iodas
"This monument could be seen by all the ships sailing past," says historian Liudmila Novikova. "Foreign sailors who came to Arkhangelsk were often taken to Mudyug to remind them of all the atrocities their fellow countrymen and governments committed here."
Schoolchildren and factory workers also came on visits.
Near the monument, we find a run-down hall with dusty glass cases, peeling red posters on the walls and photographs of the "martyrs who gave their lives for the Revolution" or died here on the island, which is described in the inscriptions as a concentration camp.
Image copyright Kirill Iodas
There are pictures of Gen Edmund Ironside, the British commander of all the Allied troops in the region. Novikova says they would have known what was happening on the island even if they never visited.
This is confirmed by an entry in the leather-bound notebooks they kept in Russia, now in the possession of their 93-year-old son.
"Scurvy seems to be beginning among the Russian prisoners on Mudyug Island… and as it is a difficult place to get to, rations have been pinched," the general writes.
If the British established the camp and some of those in charge were French, many guards seem to have been local men. "We cannot have a scandalous camp," they write. "I am responsible that the Russians treat their people well. I am always after them over the state of the prison."
But Novikova says improving conditions on Mudyug was hardly a priority for Ironside. "For them it was just a necessary security measure, and after all people were fighting and dying every day on all the fronts. So if prisoners in the rear were dying from bad conditions, that was just a drop in the ocean of suffering here."
The treatment of prisoners on Mudyug horrified one man who would later play a devastating role in northern Russia. A prominent Bolshevik close to Lenin, Mikhail Kedrov, was sent to Arkhangelsk after the October revolution and later became became a fanatical regional head of the Cheka - the secret police.
Alexander Orlov, a fellow Chekist who later defected to Canada, recalls Kedrov as a tall handsome man with ragged black hair. They write that their eyes were often "gleaming like burning coal… possibly these were the sparks of madness".

While the Red Terror was not mentioned in the USSR for decades, the crimes of the White forces were endlessly listed in official propaganda. Atrocities were committed on both sides, says historian Liudmila Novikova, but the scale was different.
"The Whites and Allies who supported them were mainly pragmatic. They wanted to kill those who undermined their effort, troops who rebelled or members of the Bolshevik underground - they didn't care about eliminating their enemies totally. It was quite different on Red side because they were waging a war against the old regime - the bourgeoisie, Tsarist officers and whole classes were perceived as enemies who had to be liquidated," they say.

Mikhail Kedrov set up a number of death camps in the North, including the first one of its kind, in Kholmogory, an hour's drive from Arkhangelsk.
Somewhere between 3,000 and 8,000 people were imprisoned and killed at a 17th Century convent. Many were White Army officers and sailors from the Kronstadt naval fortress near Finland who had rebelled against the Bolsheviks. But others had nothing to do with the military. Some were clergy, some were ordinary people who for some reason had been labelled "counter-revolutionaries".
At Kholmogory, where much of the convent is now held up by scaffolding and wrapped in corrugated iron, I met Elena, a parishioner who sings in the convent choir. They say people in the area sometimes find skulls when they dig pits to store potatoes over the winter.
Elena says the priest and volunteers collected some human remains in sacks and buried them under a marble cross on one side of the Cathedral of the Transfiguration. Each year they sing a requiem for those who died.
It's hard to pinpoint but there is an oppressive atmosphere which clings to this place, like the cold to the refectory walls when Elena invites us inside for a cup of tea.
Locals use the path through the garden as a shortcut across the town but Elena says few know - or care - about Kholmogory's terrible history.
Do they believe the Allied Intervention was the catalyst for Russia's devastating civil war, as Lenin and others have often claimed?
"I remember in my childhood hearing stories from my granny," they say. "I was a Young Pioneer and I told them the Reds were good and the Whites were bad and the Intervention troops were bad. And my granny said 'What are you talking about? The English came to our village, they brought us white flour, they gave the children sweets.' And I said: 'Granny - that is impossible they are our enemies!'"
Elena shakes their head. "They were not our enemies and to say they were responsible for the civil war is wrong. Of course not! We had enough of our own scoundrels without the intervention troops."
Mudyug and Chanel

The radical journalist, Pavel Rasskazov, who documented their ordeal on Mudyug island, describes a French-Russian officer and former business person from Moscow, a man "of medium height, stout, with a round, flabby face, like a bulldog".
Ernest Beaux was actually a perfumer who concocted scents for the tsar's family - such as the "Bouquet de Napoleon". But in 1918 they were working as a counter-intelligence officer on Mudyug, interrogating Bolsheviks captured by the White Russian and Allied armies.
By the end of the year, Beaux had emigrated to France, where a cousin of Nicholas II introduced them to the couturier, Coco Chanel. They have gone down in history as the man who invented Chanel No5. According to some accounts they wanted to capture the essence of snow melting on black earth and as inspired by their time in the "land of the midnight sun" - the Russian Arctic.

If your dog is misbehaving, you might want to spray it with pig pheromones.
Androstenone is found in boar saliva and helps induce sows to mate. Now it is the active ingredient in a spray marketed as being able to calm boisterous dogs.
John McGlone of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, who studies animal behaviour, discovered androstenone's effect by trying it on their own pet. “My dog was barking and I sprayed it and they stopped,” they say. “It's quite a serendipitous finding.”

Intrigued, McGlone developed the pheromone as a training tool. They sprayed dogs using an aerosol containing androstenone, while simultaneously exposing them to a loud noise that would normally frighten and excite them. Compared to a spray of alcohol and noise alone, the androstenone was better at keeping dogs calm. The dogs' heart rates did not increase when androstenone was used, indicating they were not scared.
McGlone has since worked with pet care company Sergeant's to commercialise the androstenone spray.
Androstenone is not the first pheromone marketed to calm an excitable pup. Dog Appeasing Pheromone (DAP) is sold in time-release collars, and supposedly mimics the smell a nursing mother gives off to them pups.
It is not clear how the pig pheromone affects dogs. “The dogs stopped barking, that was observed. But whether it has anything to do with androstenone being a pig pheromone, I think that's open,” says neuroscientist Ron Yu of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri.
“I don't really know how it works, that's the honest answer,” says McGlone.

Premier Brad Wall's decision to retire has been a financial boon for the Saskatchewan Party, with more than $385,000 in memberships sold since their announcement on Aug. 10, 2017.
According to the party, membership has nearly tripled from the 9,500 members prior to Wall's announcement, to a total of 27,125 members. Each member will be eligible to vote in the upcoming leadership election, scheduled for Jan. 27, 2018.
It is also the highest number of members the Saskatchewan Party has ever had at one time.
"The Saskatchewan Party is so excited to have this many members eligible to vote for the next Saskatchewan Party leader and Premier of Saskatchewan," said Sask. Party executive director Patrick Bundrock, in a written statement.
Just over half of the members — at 13,973 — had never held a Saskatchewan Party membership before.
By the numbers
The party offers four types of memberships. A youth membership is $5, a one-year membership is $10, three years is $25 and five years is $40. Some members may be eligible to receive a tax refund.
Here's a breakdown of the new or renewed membership totals post Aug. 10, 2017:
Youth - 1,789 members = $8,945
1 year - 5,650 = $56,500
3 year - 5,807 = $145,175
5 year - 4,379 = $175,160
A total 17,625 new or renewed memberships brought in $385,780 for the Saskatchewan Party.
The money will be split 50-50 between the party and the constituency in which the member lives.
Organizations launch campaigns
The boost in membership comes after campaigns by a variety of organizations.
The Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation encouraged the province's teachers to take out party memberships and vote in the upcoming elections for both Sask. Party and NDP leadership, depending on candidates' views on education.
We're definitely at a place in our province where we need strong leadership on both sides of the floor, so instead of being non-partisan I've switched to multi-partisan. - Tammy Robert
The Massage Therapist Association of Saskatchewan posted to Facebook calling on people to buy memberships to both parties and vote for the candidates who best support the association and its goal to secure provincial regulation for the industry.
Advocis, The Financial Advisors Association of Canada, recommended people buy Sask. Party memberships and support specific candidates who want to scrap the provincial sales tax on individual life and health insurance.
A number of Saskatchewan residents purchased memberships in order to have a say in whom the next premier of Saskatchewan will be.
Blogger becomes 'multi-partisan'
"We're definitely at a place in our province where we need strong leadership on both sides of the floor, so instead of being non-partisan I've switched to multi-partisan, I guess," said Tammy Robert, author of the Sask blog.
They also bought a membership to the NDP but found out that the party's constitution states members cannot be a supporter of any other political party.
The Saskatchewan Party will be sending out ballot packages to members in the coming days, with the deadline for members to return their mail-in ballots to the Sask. Party by Jan. 26, 2018, at 5 p.m.
Members will also have the opportunity vote in-person at the leadership convention on Jan. 27 at Prairieland Park in Saskatoon.
A one-year membership to the Sask. Party is $10, three years is $25 and five years is $40. The deadline to purchase a membership in time to vote for the new party leader passed on Dec. 8.
The other GOP candidates are finally starting to fight on Donald Trump's terms, to judge by the slugfest that was Saturday night's debate. But it speaks volumes — whole encyclopedias — about the ignorance of our political and media elites that they're only now realizing that much of what Trump's been doing is just busting balls.
It's a blue-collar ritual, with clear rules — overtly insulting, sure, but with infinite subtleties. It can be a test of manliness, a sign of respect, a way of bonding and much more.
Rule No. 1: You can wince, but don't squeal.
Rule No. 2: Bust right back, if you can.
Not knowing how to play is no excuse. And not getting it shows you have no idea how a huge swath of America lives — the Americans whom Trump has made their base.
From the start, Trump targeted the (mostly) white working class, which happens to be 40 percent of the country. And he's done it not just with issues, but with how they talk — the ball-busting, the “bragging,” the over-the-top promises.
“Bragging” is in quotes because it's not (all) about their ego: The endless reciting of poll numbers, the constant references to how much the media's paying attention, is mainly about showing that he's beating the cultural elite.
Beating the elite on behalf of their voters — who've been invisible to the politicians and the media for decades.
Consider a huge story that vanished almost immediately in early November: Two Princeton economists discovered that deaths are soaring among middle-aged, low-education whites.
The rise in mortality from 1999 to 2014 was 22 percent: Up 134 deaths per 100,000 for whites aged 45 to 54 whose education ended in high school.
To blame: jumps in suicides and in deaths from drug abuse — that is, from alcoholic liver disease plus overdoses of heroin and prescription opiates.
One of the economists, Nobel winner Angus Deaton, notes that the only modern trend that compares is the AIDS epidemic.
AIDS won headlines for a decade. The Deaton findings basically vanished from the media after a day.
And these soaring death rates are just one sign of the stresses the American working class faces. Many other blue-collar folks struggle on OK. But they know they've got huge problems that just don't get talked about — and anyone who does raise them gets denounced and then ignored.
Until Trump.
America hasn't been great for the working class for decades — which is why “Make America Great Again” is a great slogan for a guy who's talking tough on the problems that blue-collar Americans (and more than a few middle-class folks) see as killing them.
And getting attention — unbelievable attention — even as they break all the “establishment” rules.
Because he's playing and winning by blue-collar rules, and what are you gonna do about it?
Of course, they also have to show he's for real. Why should these voters trust him? Answering those unspoken doubts is why Trump doubles down on their promises — he's not just going to build a wall, but make Mexico pay.
First off, it's funny — always a plus. More, it says he'll damn well at least get the wall built.
It's the same for the huge tariffs on Chinese imports and so on: Politicians never deliver everything they promise, but the higher they aim, the more likely you'll actually get something.
And if you start negotiations with a reasonable offer, you wind up with President Obama's lousy Iran nuclear deal.
Even Republicans and conservatives who don't agree on a given issue appreciate Trump's approach. Partly, it's that — unlike the pundits and the Washington consultants — they've got working-class folks in their towns and in their families. They know how tough it is.
Plus, they're tired of losing, too.
Tired of seeing their “leaders” talk and play by the liberal media's rules, giving away the game before it even starts.
There's a lot of screaming about how Trump's ignored all the rules, lowered the level of debate, etc. But that's because he's playing by their own rules — and far from alone in that, considering their poll numbers.
There's this, too: Every new president since the '70s (at least) has been the guy who invented a fresh way to win.
I closed a column last February with this:
“A winning Republican has to connect with regular Americans in ways that call out the liberal establishment. The New York Times and the networks always called Reagan an extremist. They kept right on talking past their noise.
“His ability to do that was what they really hated about him. America needs a Republican they'll hate every bit as much.”
I was thinking of a regular Republican who could establish real working-class appeal. Trump has instead started with the working-class appeal, and built outward from there.
Which sure sounds like a new way to win.
Now watch all the times Donald Trump has ejected people from their campaign rallies:
TORONTO (miningweekly.com) – Analysts at a New York-based research firm believe that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec's) global oil reserve statements could be inflated by as much as 70%.
Global oil prices are expected to dramatically spike from the end of the decade as a result of depletion, and continue to dramatically rise into the future as a result of oil-producing countries being unable to replace reserves fast enough, research specialist Lux Research analysts told Mining Weekly Online on Thursday.

Researchers said the known oil reserves of Opec members would be depleted much sooner than thought, owing to many of the member countries producing much more oil than what they could sustain over the long term.
Oil, gas and mining analyst Rick Nariani said Opec's stated reserves skyrocketed from 878-billion barrels to 1.2-trillion barrels throughout the 1980s and 1990s, without any new significant discoveries being made. With cumulative oil production of 449-billion, the true reserves for Opec could be as low as 428.94-billion, which would result in global price shocks by 2020.

They explained certain Opec members were deliberately increasing their stated oil reserves to flout Opec regulations, which allowed oil-producing countries to only produce oil at a rate calculated as a certain percentage of its total reserves.
“We now know that the numbers are significantly inflated. The model we have built from available data shows that Opec reserve statements could be overstated by as much as 70%,” Nariani said.
Nariani, who is co-authoring a report, ‘The Race to Replace Reserves', which is due for publication during the next couple of weeks, told Mining Weekly Online that the official figures did not add up. They said that given certain new discoveries of oil, such as in Venezuela and certain technological advances which allow for previously uneconomical known deposits to be exploited, many Opec countries continued to increase their oil reserves, without announcing any new discoveries, and, all that while producing significant amounts of oil.
Nariani and report co-author Brent Giles believe global oil reserves would be depleted much sooner than thought.
Global stated recoverable oil reserves, including conventional and unconventional sources, total 1.65-trillion barrels, or 54 years of supply. If one adjusted the remaining oil reserves for population growth and nominal increases to per capita consumption rates, oil shortages could occur 18 years earlier than that, the analysts said.
That means global oil shortages within 36 years. For example, Saudi Arabia had already admitted to oil reserves declining by 8% a year since 2004, the analysts said.
However, Giles held that global oil consumption, driven higher by the increasing wealth of developing Asian and African countries, would overtake production by 2020, resulting in significant price instability.
They pointed to the need for global production to significantly increase by 2035 to meet demand, and this would need significant new reserves coming online.
“In order for the oil companies to meet future oil demand, they would have to replace current reserves at a rate of 5.4% a year. This would allow for a supply of oil for about another 90 years,” Giles said.
On its website, Opec said its "member countries have made significant additions to their oil reserves in recent years, for example, by adopting best practices in the industry, realising intensive explorations and enhancing recoveries".
The organisation held its proven oil reserves currently stood at "well above 1.19-trillion barrels".
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
The researchers said technology would be critical to unlocking potential from resource reserves, such as the 4.6-trillion barrels of oil shale deposits found in American soil. New techniques and technological applications would play an increasingly critical role in discovering new reserves.
Under these technological advances counted advanced materials for drilling equipment, fluids and additives at high pressure and temperature, targeted delivery and the controlled release of chemicals and materials, alternative fracturing techniques, enhanced recovery and beneficiation, advanced proppants, down-hole and reservoir sensors and brine and nonconventional mining systems.
The discovery of shale gas had also transformed the fossil fuel industry, with many oil-dependent applications being able to switch to cleaner and cheaper natural gas.
“There is today a lot more natural gas than previously thought. This is a good fuel source with abundant supply for still a very long time,” Nariani said.
The analysts said new technology would lead the way to also make it economical to produce from previously uneconomical reserves.
Further, Giles pointed out that the demand for oil could also be significantly reduced, particularly within the transport industry where the advent of clean technology is only now starting to materialise.

man the beericades! Craft brewers join the fight against natural gas pipelines
On a recent afternoon, visitors packed into Blue Mountain Brewery, one of three craft breweries in Virginia's idyllic Rockfish Valley. Couples and families spilled out of the restaurant onto patios and into gardens, sipping Full Nelson Pale Ale, Kölsch 151, Original Nitro Porter, and more.
Above them, the low-hanging clouds that obscured Afton Mountain's upper ridges couldn't mute the bright reds, oranges, and yellows exploding on its slopes. The brewery is just four miles below Rockfish Gap — the mountain pass that marks the southern entrance of Shenandoah National Park, the passage of the Appalachian Trail, and the point where Skyline Drive becomes the Blue Ridge Parkway.
But there's a storm brewing in this autumnal paradise, as evidenced by a sign in front of the brewery that's become quite common in the Blue Ridge Mountains of late: “No pipeline.”
Blue Mountain Brewery is part of a Nelson County activist group opposing construction of the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a proposed 550-mile transmission line to move natural gas extracted from the Marcellus shale formation from Harrison County, W.Va., through Virginia, and into North Carolina, with an additional spur running east to Virginia's Hampton Roads.
Blue Mountain joins others in the craft beer sector nationwide that are speaking out for their most important ingredient: clean water. The Natural Resources Defense Council's “Brewers for Clean Water” campaign has lined up 60 breweries, including craft beer heavyweights like Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. and New Belgium Brewing Co., to support and lobby on water quality issues.
“Great breweries grow up around good water sources,” says Taylor Smack, Blue Mountain's co-owner and head brewer. “Trace minerals in the water affect the chemistry of the mash, the flavor of the beer, how hops are received, the softness and roundness of the beer. We develop our beers around the water source.”
Many breweries are reluctant to get involved in politics for risk of alienating customers, however. That's the case not just with the NRDC's campaign, but also with the coastal pipeline proposal that's won the endorsement of a host of localities and three state governors.
Taylor Smack and their wife, Mandi, founded Blue Mountain Brewery in Rockfish Valley in 2007, after stints interning in Charlottesville, attending brewing school in Chicago, and managing Goose Island's brewpubs. Five years later, they opened an additional production facility just down the road. They expect to brew about 10,000 barrels of beer this year.
The story is a familiar one in the brewing world. Craft brewers have staked a growing claim of volume in the industry, from 4.4 percent in 2009 to 7.8 percent in 2013, according to the Brewers Association.
There are now more than 60 craft breweries in the Virgina alone, and there are more on the way. Just this month, San Diego's Stone Brewing Company announced it would build an East Coast facility in Richmond, and the same city's Green Flash Brewing Company broke ground on a facility in Virginia Beach.
Now, Smack worries that all this growth could be compromised, thanks to a natural gas drilling boom and construction of interstate pipelines to move it to East Coast population centers.
Smack lays out some of the concerns: “It's a 42-inch pipeline, which is huge, pressurized to 1,000 PSI,” Smack says. “From a guy that deals with pressure on a daily basis, that's scary. It runs over sinkholes, over fault lines — we've had three earthquakes since we've been here.”
He's also upset with the potential for use of eminent domain to force the line through private property against the wishes of landowners. He's worried that visitors will be put off by damage to the surrounding mountain views.
“I understand they're going to blaze a mohawk, 75 feet wide, right through our viewshed,” Smack says.
But the politics get complicated.
For example, a recent proposal from the Environmental Protection agency has split the industry. The Waters of the United States rule would clarify the Clean Water Act to give the agency regulatory authority over an additional 2 million miles of stream and 20 million acres of wetlands. The Brewers for Clean Water alliance, and many independent brewers, support the proposal. But the Hill reported in September that farmers who grow their ingredients oppose it.
If there's division within the industry over the new water rule, there's near silence when it comes to the question of natural gas.
The Atlantic Coast pipeline proposal, put forward by four energy companies who operate in different territories along the route, is part of a larger effort to develop East Coast infrastructure to move gas out of the Marcellus shale field. Hydraulic fracturing technology, or fracking, has opened the geological feature to mining, growing production from 2 billion cubic feet per day in 2010 to roughly 15 billion cubic feet per day today, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It now accounts for roughly 40 percent of U.S. shale gas production.
“The gas is there. What's not there are pipelines to get it from where it is to where it's needed,” says Jim Norvelle, communications director for Dominion, one of the four Atlantic Coast pipeline partners.
Norvelle dismissed Smack's concerns about the pipeline's potential impact on water quality. Crossing running water, they say, “is the most regulated activity that we will have to do on the pipeline. We will have federal, state, and local regulators involved every time we want to cross a river or stream or anytime we come anywhere near a well. It's not done haphazardly; it is done under great regulatory scrutiny.”
A second pipeline through Virginia, called the Mountain Valley Pipeline, has been proposed by a different set of partners for a more southwestern route that also would transport natural gas to North Carolina. It too has met opposition from local residents.

The pipeline proposals come at a time when EPA regulations on mercury and greenhouse gas emissions are pushing power companies away from coal-burning plants to those that run on natural gas. Dominion Virginia Power, for example, is shuttering two Virginia plants powered by coal, “so we've got to find the megawatts to take their place,” Norvelle says.
The so-called “War on Coal” still drives votes in the Appalachian coalfields of southwest Virginia and West Virginia, but the market has dictated the shift to natural gas as much as EPA regulations. Although the debate over fracking continues, natural gas burns cleaner than coal, making it a viable “bridge fuel” to a renewable future in the eyes of many — including President Obama and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.
The specter of mountaintop removal in Appalachia, paired with a series of oil train derailments across the country, has only boosted natural gas' reputation as the best of all viable alternatives at the moment.
So while Blue Mountain Brewery is allying itself with anti-pipeline activists, its larger, higher profile neighbor, Devils Backbone Brewing Co., has remained on the sidelines.
Devils Backbone currently brews about four times as much beer as Blue Mountain. And with a developing reputation as the darling of the Great American Beer Festival every year since 2009 — the brewery won five medals this year, including Mid-Size Brewing Company of the Year and a gold for German-style Schwarzbier — it's set to ramp up production even more.
Devils Backbone founder and CEO Steve Crandal, a self-described “conservative tree-hugger,” has implemented water protection measures on their farm, such as planting trees in riparian zones and adding water troughs to keep their livestock off streams. Additionally, Devils Backbone dedicates a dollar per case of its Striped Bass Pale Ale to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
Crandall, however, has been more cautious about taking on the Atlantic Coast pipeline. That's partly due to their feeling that natural gas offers a smaller carbon footprint than many other energy sources, and partly due to the fact it's used in Devils Backbone's larger production brewery, located to the southwest in Rockbridge County. (Its smaller brewpub in Nelson County uses propane instead.)
“We all use steam to boil water for our beer, and we use steam to clean our tanks,” Crandall says. “That's all done through a gas boiler. You're either going to use natural gas or you're going to use propane to do that. Natural gas is a much preferable option to propane. It costs less and has less of a carbon footprint.”
Crandall does see a potential 75-foot blaze over the mountains as a “blight on the county,” and says they don't understand why the pipeline can't run alongside previously used rights of way, such as Interstate 64 or electric transmission lines.
“I hate the idea my neighbors are being forced to swallow this project,” says Crandall. “The other side of the equation is, we use a lot of gas — we use it to make our beer.”
And from a big-picture energy perspective, Crandall understands the impetus for the Atlantic Coast pipeline. “Gas is not perfect by any means — you've got to frack for it, and methane does escape — but it burns cleaner than just about anything else we've got,” they say.
The four energy companies collaborating on the Atlantic Coast pipeline are set to make a pre-filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this fall, followed by a formal application next summer. If approved, the pipeline could be up and running by late 2018.
Blue Mountain Brewery has jumped into the fight against the current route, agreeing to host meetings of the Friends of Nelson, a local group formed around opposition to the Atlantic Coast pipeline. To the north, in Cooperstown, New York, Brewery Ommegang has likewise taken a vocal stance against fracking.
At this point, though, those breweries still tend to be outliers. Karen Hobbs, a senior policy analyst with NRDC who heads up the “Brewers for Clean Water” campaign, says it's not unimaginable that others may eventually join them, however.
“We want to take on issues important to our brewers,” Hobbs says. “We want a true partnership with them so we can engage on issues they're concerned about that affect their breweries. If one of those is fracking, we'll have that conversation — but we haven't had it yet about fracking except with a couple of brewers.”
Bobby Reno, a mainstay of New Orleans radio for 50 years whose career as a disc jockey began and ended at WTIX, where they were one of the more popular on-air personalities of the 1960s, died Monday, co-workers said. They were 72.
In a business not known for its longevity, Reno was one of the most familiar voices on the local dial, having worked in the business for more than a half century.
For the past 21 years, Reno was a disc jockey on the afternoon drive shift on WTIX-FM 94.3. They began their career on the legendary 1960s station with the same call letters, then 690 AM.
Reno, whose real surname was Guarino, did their last on-air shift at WTIX-FM about three weeks ago, according to fellow WTIX-FM disc jockey “Pal Al” Nassar. Reno had suffered with health problems in recent months, which prompted them to leave the airwaves about three months ago to recover. They had returned for a brief stint recently, just weeks before their death, Nassar said.
According to the station, Reno started their New Orleans radio career at WTIX in 1965, on the weekend of Hurricane Betsy. They quickly became one of the top air personalities on WTIX.
“I thought Bobby was one of the best voices in New Orleans radio,” said Nassar. “He really was the consummate 1960s radio jock of the day, but then later they adapted to changes in the business and stayed with it up until just a few weeks ago.”
Fellow disc jockey Bob Walker, who joined the WTIX-AM staff in 1967, remembered Reno as one of the original WTIX “boss jocks,” as they were called. “Since they started in 1965, they really are at the dawn of the boss jocks,” Walker said. “That fast-paced, manic style was about to sweep the country and they were on the forefront of it here.”
The "boss jocks" of WTIX competed against the "good guys" of WNOE in the 1960s. Listeners remained loyal to one station or the other, but disc jockeys at both stations became some of the best-known personalities in town.
According to a station bio, after leaving WTIX in the late 1960s, Reno moved to the FM dial and helped launch the rock format on WRNO as program director. After working at stations in Memphis and St. Louis, they returned to New Orleans as the program director and a drive-time personality for WNOE-FM.
They returned to WRNO in the 1980s, followed by a stint on WCKW-FM as program director. They joined the newly launched WTIX-FM in 1995, playing many of the same songs they did as a disc jockey in the 1960s.
Early in their career Reno was billed as the singing disc jockey, since they performed as a singer and musician in addition to spinning records. Walker recalled that Reno played with two bands called Bobby Reno and the Infernos and Bobby Reno and the Heavyweights. They also recorded several songs on local record labels.
According to family, visitation will be held Oct. 22 at 9 a.m. at Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home, 5100 Pontchartrain Blvd., with a memorial service at 11 a.m.

The strongest sectors of the S&P 500 this year includes many shares of companies that pay high dividends and have kept investors' faith by not cutting payouts for at least the past five years.
The two hot sectors are telecommunications services and utilities, and Howard Gold looked at the reasons for their strength.
These sectors are known to feature many stocks with high dividend yields. The market values of income-producing investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and all things being equal, that's a concern when interest rates look set to rise, as is the case this year. But things aren't always equal, especially if a company paying nice dividends is also growing its business.
During 2015, there was plenty of fear that interest rates would rise rapidly. The utilities sector had a negative return of 5%, even with dividends reinvested, while the telecommunications sector had a relatively decent total return of 3%.
But it has been very clear in 2016 that Federal Reserve policymakers, led by Chairwoman Janet Yellen, are taking the sluggish world economy into account and are in no hurry to raise rates. This has provided quite a boost for utilities and telecoms, which feature many companies with dividend yields that are very attractive. That's especially true considering that 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.34% yielded just 1.76% on Wednesday.
Here's a breakdown of how the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 have fared so far during 2016, with dividends reinvested:
S&P 500 sector Total return - YTD, through April 6 Telecommunications Services 16% Utilities 13% Consumer Staples 7% Industrials 4% Materials 4% Energy 3% Information Technology 3% Consumer Discretionary 1% Health Care -2% Financials -6% S&P 500 2% Source: FactSet
We included reinvested dividends for a fair comparison of total returns, but many investors holding stocks in utilities and telecommunications companies don't reinvest — they want the dividend income.
Some companies among the two sectors have cut dividends, and their executives certainly believed they had good reasons to make those cuts. They may have needed to hold on to the cash to fund acquisitions, for example. But income-seeking investors were sure to be disappointed no matter the reasons.
So we narrowed the list to the highest-yielding S&P 500 telecom and utility stocks that not only paid regular cash dividends for the past five years, but also didn't cut dividends payouts:
Among the companies on this list, AT&T Inc. T, +0.29% and Consolidated Edison Inc. ED, -0.32% also are among the 50 stocks included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index SPDAUDP, -0.34% which is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The Dividend Aristocrats are 50 S&P 500 companies that have raised their regular cash dividends for at least 25 straight years. The group had a stellar first quarter.

It is difficult to fathom that a religious group might be behind a poison gas attack on hundreds of civilians. More likely, logic suggests, it would either be the result of a terrible accident or the work of a deranged individual. When confronted with such a scenario in Matsumoto in 1994, the Nagano Police Department went with the lone-wolf theory.
Their chief suspect was Yoshiyuki Kono, a machinery salesperson who lived in a sprawling wooden house next to the site where members of Aum Shinrikyo decided to park the customized vehicle carrying the deadly nerve agent.
Kono was the first to contact emergency services after their wife fell unconscious, with records showing that they called at 11:09 p.m. on June 27, 1994. The next 119 call from another victim didn't come until 29 minutes later.
Police began to suspect the poison gas had originated from Kono's property, and their suspicions grew after finding more than 20 chemicals in their possession. Kono told officers they had purchased the chemicals for photo processing and pottery.
Considerable chemistry expertise is required to manufacture sarin, but Kono had no qualifications or experience in this field. Moreover, sarin cannot be synthesized from the chemicals Kono was found to be in possession of.
It wasn't long, however, before some newspapers openly named Kono as the prime suspect in the case.
“Before this happened, I thought the media just reported on facts, but I was really surprised when this happened to me,” Kono told The Japan Times. “They were reporting lies and including quotes from me that I hadn't even said. For example, they quoted me as saying I had made a mistake when mixing chemicals, which accidentally produced poison gas. They also claimed I had mixed up the specific quantity of certain chemicals. These were blatant lies.”
Unfortunately, however, they were believable lies.
Toshie Koibuchi, Kono's neighbor, said it was easy to get sucked into the media's take on things.
“The media said it was him, so of course everyone thought it was him,” they said.
Not quite everyone. Hideo Osawa, a Protestant pastor now working in Kanagawa Prefecture, is remembered by their former congregation in Matsumoto as someone who stood against the tide of accusations against Kono.
“I didn't know if they were guilty or not, but they were named in newspapers as a prime suspect within three days of the incident,” Osawa recalled. “I think the police leaked the information. How could reporters have had enough information to say they were the perpetrator?”
Kono was about to lose their faith in another institution — the police.
“I was in hospital for a month,” they recalled. “During that time I thought the police would protect me. However, when I got out and the police came to question me, they treated me like a criminal.”
Their wife was in hospital, too, in a coma. Described by Kono as “a cheerful woman with a variety of interests that included cooking and calligraphy,” they died from their injuries in 2008.
Two of their three teenage children were also hospitalized after the attack but for a shorter period of time. Left without their parents, Osawa and others in the community banded together to help.
“Their house was surrounded by reporters, so the mothers of their school friends gave them a place to sleep,” Osawa said. “I didn't know Kono at that time, but our children were classmates at the same junior high school. I was part of an informal support group. We made food and got them pajamas, that sort of thing, as well as organized a place for them to sleep.”
“I didn't know if they were guilty or not but I wanted to protect the right of their family to live a normal life,” Osawa said.
As most people around Kono believed they were behind the attacks, local support was sparse.
“I was going door to door to the hospital in a taxi so I didn't meet anyone, but people around me — relatives and friends — were treated as if they were responsible for the crime,” Kono said. “I heard that they were discriminated against.”
It took another terrorist attack by Aum on Tokyo's subway system almost nine months later before people began to believe that Kono was an innocent and grievously wronged man.
However, it took the police in Nagano, who declined a request for an interview, a little longer to review the evidence in front of them.
“I wasn't ruled out of being involved in the Matsumoto incident because the sarin attacks were carried out in Tokyo,” Kono said.
In 1995, the Nagano Police Department said at a news conference they “regretted” their treatment of him. Seven years later, they received an official apology.
Matsumoto's brush with sarin helped save lives in wake of cult's 1995 attack on Tokyo subway system
Hiroshi Morita was at work when they first saw television reports of Aum Shinrikyo's sarin attack on Tokyo's subway system. It was March 20, 1995, and they had just finished a medical report on the cult group's attack in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, nine months earlier with Shinshu University Hospital colleague Nobuo Yanagisawa and others.
The 176-page report was to be released later that day. “Professor Yanagisawa called me to their room and said, ‘It seems to be sarin exposure,'” Morita told The Japan Times. “We have to call the major hospitals in Tokyo and tell them how to treat it.”
At that time, the two doctors were probably the country's leading experts on sarin poisoning. They had treated and studied victims of the sarin attack in Matsumoto, and could now use their knowledge to help those injured by the one in Tokyo.
The first few hours are crucial for sarin victims. Sarin paralyzes the respiratory system, causing victims to die as a result of asphyxiation.
Patients are usually intubated — that is, a tube is put down their throat and they are kept on an artificial ventilator — and are also given drugs such as pralidoxime as an antidote and diazepam to treat seizures. Treatment is straightforward and almost always successful if carried out soon after exposure.
Morita acted quickly. First, they called the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, seeking their help to get the message out.
“But their response was not so serious,” Morita said. “I said I would send them a fax detailing how to treat the victims but they didn't express so much interest.”
They and their colleagues then began calling hospitals in Tokyo directly. They produced a hasty summary of the relevant sections from their report and sent the information to more than two dozen medical facilities by fax.
The bureaucrats may not have appreciated the significance of Morita's phone call, but the reception they received from hospital personnel who were initially ignorant of the cause of the mass poisoning was more positive.
“The doctors were pleased with our suggestions and other doctors who knew me called our hospital directly,” Morita recalled.
The Tokyo attack killed 13 and harmed around 6,000, but the casualty list could have been much higher. However, Morita refuses to take credit.
“The most important thing was the doctors in Tokyo,” they said. “They did their best.”
The Ritz-Carlton of Failed States
Amid gunfire between the Pakistani military and Taliban fighters in the Swat Valley a few years ago, BBC reporter Nadene Ghouri found themselves the lone guest at the luxurious Serena Hotel just outside the city of Mingora — and right in the center of the action. Despite the nearby battle, uniformed staff attended to them every need. When Ghouri inquired how they could afford to keep up the impeccable service, a saffron-suited waiter replied: "We are a five-star hotel, madam. We must maintain standards at all times."
The intense fighting eventually proved too much, and the Swat Valley hotel, part of the Serena chain operated by the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development, was mothballed for more than a year. It reopened in April 2010, after the Pakistani military had pushed back the militants. Now the chain is looking to expand operations in — of all places — war-torn Afghanistan, where its five-star hotel in Kabul has been struck by Taliban rocket fire, beset by rioters, and damaged in a deadly bombing. Rooms at the Kabul Serena start at $356 per night, sealed off from the disheveled crowds, street noise, and fetid sewage outside. Call it blind optimism, but Serena now wants to create what it calls a "tourism circuit" in Afghanistan, with possible hotels in Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif.
It's a niche: the Ritz-Carlton of failed states. Serena owns 35 hotels, resorts, and lodges across nine countries, most of them outposts of multi-star luxury in places where residents live in zero-star conditions. High-risk hostelry has proved to be a booming business, as the chain — named Serena in a deliberate echo of the title "His Serene Highness" used by the Aga Khan's father — has doubled in size over the past decade, inaugurating a new property every two years, the most recent last November on the site of a Soviet-era shoe factory in Tajikistan. The Serena properties in East Africa reported a 33 percent rise in profits for 2010, and the entire hotel group is estimated to be worth more than half a billion dollars.
Serena doesn't confine its operations to dangerous locales, but the chain is very much driven to the world's political frontiers by its unusual benefactor. The 75-year-old Aga Khan — with personal wealth estimated at $2.7 billion — is the spiritual leader of the world's 15 million Ismaili Muslims, followers of a Shiite branch of Islam who regard them as a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed. They started the Serena chain in the 1970s in Africa and then began opening hotels closer to large Ismaili communities in Central Asia.
Today's Serena touts its unusual business strategy — in effect, combining development work with the quest for profits. "We are not in business to lose money," says Serena's managing director, Mahmud Jan Mohamed, "but our objectives are different from other hotel companies. We're happy to take on difficult projects." The Aga Khan themselves has described Serena's involvement in troubled states and post-conflict areas as bringing an "investment seal of approval" to attract even more foreign capital. "In all of these places," they said at the 2006 opening of the Serena in Kampala, Uganda, "our goal is not merely to build an attractive building or to fill its rooms with visitors, but also to make a strategic investment which many private investors might be reluctant to make."
It's a vision not unlike that of the Hilton hotel chain in the 1950s, when the U.S. State Department thought opening beacons of modernity and Western comfort in exotic settings could bolster economic and political stability amid fears of rising Soviet influence. Washington actually financed part of Hilton's overseas expansion through the Marshall Plan, funneling millions of dollars through the State Department's Foreign Buildings Operations program to pay for construction in places such as Baghdad, Berlin, Cairo, and Istanbul.
In today's Afghanistan and Pakistan — where Serena runs nine hotels, including its heavily guarded flagship in the heart of Islamabad — the properties are supported and partly owned by the World Bank's International Finance Corp. and Norfund, the Norwegian-backed development institution. "Other partners see things are going sour and they want to pull out," says Kjartan Stigen, Norfund's investment director. "They hang in there in bad times."
Serena's philosophy finds its ultimate test in places like Quetta, Pakistan, the Taliban's headquarters south of the Durand Line. Home to the Haqqani network, the surrounding area is rife with Islamic militants and suicide attacks — and a Baluchi separatist insurgency. But the hotel, built with curving mud walls typical of local architecture, is a haven of cool marble tiles and flower-filled courtyards. Wood and onyx decorations dot the public areas, which include three restaurants, a swimming pool, and two posh presidential suites. For all its opulent amenities, however, the Serena resembles a military barracks from the outside. "It's a fortress, but a very elegant, luxurious fortress with terrific restaurants," says Jonathan Landay, a national security correspondent for McClatchy Newspapers.
Across the border in Afghanistan, the Kabul Serena was converted into an oasis of well-being with marble bathrooms, a health spa, sun deck, swimming pool, pastry shop, and banquet hall, as well as its own electric generators after a $36 million overhaul of the battle-scarred and decrepit Hotel Kabul. So far, the Serena has been attacked three times. Within months of its 2005 opening, rioters rampaged through the lobby, driven by a mistaken belief that the hotel served alcohol. (Other hotels in the chain do.) In 2008, Taliban suicide bombers struck again, killing eight people, including a Filipino spa worker. Then, in 2009, two rockets hit the premises, shattering windows and filling the reception area with smoke.
With each attack, the hotel has beefed up security, installing blast barricades, high perimeter walls, and armed guards. A loyal clientele of dignitaries, diplomats, consultants, aid workers, and journalists keeps occupancy rates above 60 percent. "Kabul would not have an international-standard hotel, which it needs, without the Serena," says Barnett Rubin, a State Department advisor on Afghanistan, "and no normal hotel company would have done it."
But doing business in problematic states brings, well, problems. In Syria, where the Aga Khan has signed agreements with the government of President Bashar al-Assad to open hotels in Damascus and Aleppo, Serena is vowing to complete plans made before the brutal crackdown by Assad's regime that began in March 2011. Under the 2008 agreements, the properties will be state-owned but operated by the Aga Khan Development Network. "My interest in working in Syria," the Aga Khan said in Aleppo when the deal was inked, "is to take the various lead countries of the ummah [the global Muslim community] and say, ‘Let's start. Let's move together. Let's revive our cultures so that modernity is not only seen in the terminology of the West, but in the intelligent use of our past.'"
Now, with Syria facing international sanctions over Assad's violent suppression of dissent that the United Nations says has already killed more than 6,000 people, hotels are nearly empty, and the decision to continue work with the bloodstained and internationally isolated Assad could hurt the Aga Khan's reputation.
Still, Serena's Syria construction is moving forward. The chain is restoring three landmark houses built in the 18th and 19th centuries in the Old City of Damascus and refurbishing former government offices in Aleppo built during the French colonial period.
It's hard to predict what Syria might look like when the facilities are slated to open in a few years. Even if Assad succeeds in clinging to power, luxury tourists are unlikely to rush to Syria to see the country's famous ruins. But if nothing else, there will at least be a hot shower and a plush bed for the journalists covering the chaos — and the business people seeking to profit from it.
Netflix added four million subscribers in the first fiscal quarter of 2014, besting analysts' expectations and its own performance from a year ago. Netflix now has more than 46 million paying subscribers, 34.38 million of them in the United States.
The additions came in the same quarter a bevy of original TV shows and movies, including “House of Cards,” “Mitt” and “The Square,” premiered on Netflix. Netflix has chased the exclusive rights to movies and TV shows to engender loyalty from subscribers and attract new ones.
“House of Cards” has been the biggest hit on the TV side, though popular shows such a “Derek,” “Orange Is the New Black” and “Hemlock Grove” all return for new seasons this summer as well.

That strategy is paying off. The company passed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in the quarter, while earnings per share nudged up t0 $0.86. That figure has climbed each of the past five quarters. Netflix reported EPS of just $0.05 in Q1 of 2013.
The next area of focus for investors and executives will be overseas. Though Netflix now has larger subscriber base than HBO in the United States, its international operation is still in its nascent stage.
Netflix's international subscriber base has almost doubled in the past year, and it now has 11.76 million paying subscribers.

The expansion was costly at the outset, but its existing operations will be profitable by the end of the year, CEO Reed Hastings said in a note to investors.
“International revenues currently amount to 25% of our total streaming revenue and we anticipate our international segment to eventually surpass our U.S. market, similar to other Internet firms,” they wrote. “Our present international segment is on a path to achieve profitability this year.”
That statement about profitability does not cover Netflix's expected expansion into new European territories. It is currently available in the U.K., Netherlands and Scandinavia.

Netflix sometimes uses those territories as a testing ground for new products, and it will soon bring one experiment — a price increase — to the United States. Experts have speculated for some time that Netflix would raise its prices given the high cost of producing and acquiring premium video. Hastings has been noncommittal, but in this note they wrote that raising prices for new customers in Ireland had “little impact.”
“Our current view is to do a one or two dollar increase, depending on the country,
later this quarter for new members only,” Hastings said in their note. “Existing members would stay at current pricing (e.g. $7.99 in the U.S.) for a generous time period.”
There is a growing talk among mainstream economists and the financial media of a new global economic recession. Until the last few weeks, the locus of this new slump has been focused on China. But, as I have argued in a previous post, it is unlikely to start there. Much more important to the world economy is the largest economy in the world in terms of national output and financial fire-power, the US.
In the last few weeks, there has been a continuous series of poor data for the US economy: falling manufacturing output, weakening business sentiment and capital goods orders and falling corporate profits. And globally, international agencies by the week seem to announce reduced forecasts for economic expansion.
The latest of these agencies, after the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD, is the United Nations. In its report on global economic perspectives, it concluded that “the world economy stumbled in 2015 and only a modest improvement is projected for 2016/17 as a number of cyclical and structural headwinds persist”. 2016wesp_full_en
UN economists downgraded their final estimate for global growth in 2015 from 2.8% to just 2.4% – remember the average prior to the Great Recession for global growth was 4-5% a year. Naturally, like the other agencies, it expects an improvement this year and next: “The world economy is projected to grow by 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.2 per cent in 2017, supported by generally less restrictive fiscal and still accommodative monetary policy stances worldwide.” But then each year these more optimistic forecasts are dashed and revised.
The UN also confirmed a key indicator of the Long Depression, that I call the period since the end of the Great Recession of 2008-9. As Professor Joseph Stiglitz put it in a recent article: “Moreover, the UN report clearly shows that, throughout the developed world, private investment did not grow as one might have expected, given ultra-low interest rates. In 17 of the 20 largest developed economies, investment growth remained lower during the post-2008 period than in the years prior to the crisis; five experienced a decline in investment during 2010-2015.” Indeed, the average growth rate in developed economies has declined by more than 54% since the crisis. An estimated 44 million people are unemployed in developed countries, about 12 million more than in 2007, while inflation has reached its lowest level since the crisis.
Stiglitz went onto consider “what's holding back the world economy?” They noted what some of us have been saying for years: that quantitative easing by central banks, as used in the US, Japan, the UK and belatedly in the EU, has failed to boost growth and investment. The problem was that the banks used the cheap cash from central banks not to lend onto companies to invest or households to spend, but to build up their cash reserves or buy government bonds or their own shares.
As Stiglitz concluded: “Clearly, keeping interest rates at the near zero level does not necessarily lead to higher levels of credit or investment. When banks are given the freedom to choose, they choose riskless profit or even financial speculation over lending that would support the broader objective of economic growth.” Of course, this is something that many Marxist economists have been saying for years – in opposition to the hopes of Keynesian economists like Paul Krugman or Noah Smith. Moreover, what could provide a better case for the public takeover of banking systems in the major economies so that credit can be directed productively and not for bank profits?
Stiglitz also directs our attention to the massive reversal of capital inflows to so-called emerging economies. “An unintended, but not unexpected, consequence of monetary easing has been sharp increases in cross-border capital flows. Total capital inflows to developing countries increased from about $20bn in 2008 to over $600bn in 2010. Very little of it went to fixed investment. This year, developing countries, taken together, are expected to record their first net capital outflow – totalling $615bn – since 2006.” Actually, according to the Institute of International Finance, the outflow figure was even larger, with net capital outflows of an estimated $735bn during 2015, the first year of net outflows since 1988!
As another international agency, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), put it in its latest quarterly review, the surge in lending to emerging markets that helped fuel their own — and much of the world's — growth over the past 15 years has come to a halt, and may now give way to a “vicious circle” of deleveraging, financial market turmoil and a global economic downturn. “In the risk-on phase [of the global economic cycle], lending sets off a virtuous circle in financial conditions in which things can look better than they really are,” said Hyun Song Shin, head of research at the BIS, known as the central bank of central banks. “But flows can quickly go into reverse and then it becomes a vicious circle, especially if there is leverage.”
The BIS reported that the total stock of dollar-denominated credit in bonds and bank loans to emerging markets — including that to governments, companies and households but excluding that to banks — was $3.33tn at the end of September 2015, down from $3.36tn at the end of June. This was the first decline in such lending since the first quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis, according to the BIS.
In previous posts I have pointed out that the huge rise in credit to emerging markets threatens a major bust especially if the profitability of capital should begin to fall in these economies.
And that is just what is happening. The return on equity capital in advanced capitalist economies is below levels before the Great Recession but it partially recovered from 2009 and only started to fall in the last year or so. But profitability in emerging economies has been falling since 2012 and is now below that of advanced economies for the first time.
The head of IIF, Caruana commented, “The issue is not just for emerging markets. It is spilling back into developed markets. The broader financial markets are recoiling from risk, and that spreads across all markets. The problem now is that the real economy is being affected.”
In my last post, I took up the issue of negative interest rate policy (NIRP). This is the new policy forced upon central banks to try and get the world capitalist economy out of this Long Depression. Zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) has failed, quantitative easing (QE) or printing money has failed, so now let's charge banks and other financial institutions for keeping cash and try to force them to lend or invest. Several small central banks had already adopted NIRP (Switzerland and Sweden) but last week, one of the largest, the Bank of Japan, applied NIRP.
The BoJ vote to do so was only 5-4 because the minority were not convinced that it would work. Indeed, NIRP could make things worse, they thought. NIRP is the last throw of the dice in monetary policy and if it did not work in getting the Japanese economy out of its stagnation, the Bank would be seen to be helpless. And why should NIRP work any better in stimulating business investment than ZIRP or QE?
Within weeks, it is becoming clear that NIRP is not working. Japanese government ten-year bond yields dropped into negative territory. This means that banks and other corporate investors would prefer to pay the Bank of Japan and the government for holding bonds for the next decade rather than spend cash or invest! And that behaviour is happening increasingly globally. The volume of government bonds trading below zero interest has now reached $6trn, or one-third of the entire global sovereign bond market!
So what is to be done? Martin Wolf, the Keynesian economic journalist for the UK's FT, asked the question in a recent article. Their answer seemed to be more of the same ‘unconventional' monetary policy. “It is crucial to recognise that something more unconventional might have to be done”. Another recession was bound to come along and doing nothing about it was not an option.
Wolf went through the various options that I have discussed above and eventually concluded that the only one left with the possibility of success was “helicopter money” — dropping money directly into people's bank accounts in so that they spent more. This is similar to the People's QE advocated by some of the current leftist Labour opposition in the UK and has been mooted before by heterodox economists. I have discussed this option in a previous post when it was proposed by maverick Bank of England economist, Andy Haldane.
In my view, it won't work because it assumes that what is wrong with the capitalist economy and the reason for the continued Long Depression and the prospect of another slump is the Keynesian explanation of a ‘lack of demand'. For Keynesians, you can create extra spending through money creation. This leads to increased employment and then to increased income and growth and thus to more profits. But the reality of the capitalist system is the other way round. Only if profitability is sufficient, will investment increase and lead to more jobs and then incomes and consumption. The demand for money will rise accordingly. Artificial money creation by fiat from the government does not get round this – as the experience of ‘quantitative easing' has already shown.
Instead, we must look at what is happening with profits and profitability. And as I have shown in several previous posts, the profitability of business capital in the major economies is near historic post-1945 lows and the limited recovery in profitability since 2009 has come to an end. Indeed, global corporate profit growth has ground to a halt and is now falling in China, the UK and most important in the US.
Last week, the investment bank, JP Morgan, noted that US corporate profit margins (the share of profit in each unit of national output) have started to fall back from its record highs. After the slowdown in US productivity growth to near zero, as reported last week, JPM's economists now expect US corporate profits to fall by 10% this year.
And here is the rub. As I and (a few) other Marxist economists have argued, JPM points out that every time there is such a large fall, an economic recession is not far behind, because such a fall is seldom not followed by an economic recession. I quote: “this week's larger-than-expected productivity drop in 4Q15 points to a 10% drop in corporate profits from year-ago levels. A double-digit decline in profits is a rare event outside recessions, having been recorded only twice in the last half century”.
JPM has raised the probability of a US economic recession from 10% to 25% in 2016. And that probability is greater than 50% before 2017 is out.
I have commented on the possibility of a new global recession in previous posts. My view is that it is due and will take place in the next one to three years at most. Some mainstream economists are now forecasting a more than 50% chance for 2016. Citibank economists reckon that there is a 65% chance in 2016.
This doom-mongering is dismissed by others. Bill McBride from Calculated Risk trashed those recession mongers who think it is on the cards for next year. Says McBride: “For the last 6+ years, there have been an endless parade of incorrect recession calls. The manufacturing sector has been weak, and contracted in the US in November due to a combination of weakness in the oil sector, the strong dollar and some global weakness. But this doesn't mean the US will enter a recession. The last time the index contracted was in 2012 (no recession), and has shown contraction a number of times outside of a recession. Looking at the economic data, the odds of a recession in 2016 are very low (extremely unlikely in my view).”
Maybe it won't be in 2016. But the factors for a new recession are increasingly in place: falling profitability and profits in the major economies and a rising debt burden for corporations in both mature and emerging economies. And the Fed set to hike the cost of borrowing in dollars. As I said before, it's a poisonous concoction.
Can we avoid this slump? Stiglitz's answer to avoid this is to ‘direct' banks to lend for investment or household spending and to introduce “large increases in public investment in infrastructure, education, and technology” to be financed by higher taxes on ‘monopolies'. No doubt, increased public investment would help to compensate for the failure of capitalist investment. But the world is capitalist: governments are not going to boost public investment if it means higher taxes for corporations, reducing their profitability even more. So even this moderate policy for more public investment is a challenge to capitalism in an environment of low profitability, rising debt and depressed growth – something that Keynesian/Marxist Michel Kalecki at the end of the Great Depression of the 1930s pointed out.
Wolf's ‘helicopter money' and Stiglitz's tax-funded public investment are poor options. It is not the banking system that has to be by-passed or directed but the capitalist system of production for profit that has to replaced by planned investment under common ownership.

As Sony prepares to get out of the PC market, reports of a battery defect in one of its new notebooks will do little to preserve a happy memory of its legacy. The Wall Street Journal reports that an issue with Sony's VAIO Fit 11A could cause the laptop to overheat and catch fire, so the company's asking owners to stop using it immediately. Sony's already sold 25,905 units in total, with the majority shipping to Europe, but has not yet issued an official recall for the device. That is the expected outcome, however, leaving the struggling electronics giant with another major headache just as it completes the sale of its VAIO arm to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP).
Update: Sony has released more information on the issue, confirming that it will "repair or replace the affected PCs at no charge, or to refund the purchase price for the affected PCs." The company says it expects to issue further guidance within the next two weeks, warning users not to touch their notebook until that time.
I read Sunday's report ("Fare cuts by Uber, Grab will hurt sector: Taxi body") with incredulity and dismay.
It is unfair for the National Taxi Association (NTA) to criticise Grab and Uber's creative business strategies when some of the taxi body's members' bad behaviour is the source of the problem to begin with.
Time and again, commuters have complained about the unavailability of taxis without any clear response from the NTA to address the issue.
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had to step in to introduce city area and other surcharges to entice taxi drivers to stay on the streets.
Now, a commuter booking a taxi in the Central Business District in the evening could be paying close to $10 without the taxi having moved an inch - three times the regular flagdown fare.
Still, these measures did not improve the availability of taxis, and the LTA subsequently imposed a 250km daily coverage requirement.
These reactive measures would have been unnecessary if taxi drivers were meeting commuters' needs in the first place.
Even today, the bad behaviour persists - choosing customers by destination, zooming by taxi queues or hiding in carparks to wait for bookings to come in, not accepting electronic payment and disappearing before the surcharges kick in.
What has the NTA done to change taxi drivers' mindsets?
A taxi driver's profession is a service job, and the rules have changed with technology and customer expectations.
If taxi drivers aren't willing to adapt, commuters will readily find alternative service providers who meet their needs, regardless of price.
Taxi drivers, too, have the option of joining third-party taxi app firms.
One cannot blame entrepreneurship for solving customers' problems, and most certainly, one cannot ask to be saved from a fire while fanning the embers.

The Baltimore Ravens continue to be snake-bitten at tight end.
Ed Dickson will miss extended time after an MRI showed a slight tear in their hamstring. Dickson was injured during Sunday's practice.
Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Dickson will be "out a week or so." The Ravens' Twitter page -- perhaps rightfully more conservative -- relayed that Dickson will be out of action "a couple of weeks." Harbaugh, however, expects Dickson to be ready for the season opener.
"It's going to be a matter of time, but it's not going to be a long time," Harbaugh said.
Either way, this isn't good news for the Ravens, who have been adjusting their game plan following Dennis Pitta's season-ending hip injury suffered last week. The team had hoped to use Dickson in a Pitta-like "move" role, but those plans are on hold for the time being.
Up next for the Ravens at tight end? Visanthe Shiancoe, who was signed just last week. The veteran was working with the first-team in practice on Monday.

BOSTON -- The Red Sox may well have cheated in an attempt to steal signs. That does not eliminate a feeling for the Sox that the Yankees have been going out of their way to mess with them -- as a matter of retribution or simply regular business under team president Randy Levine.
SPYGATE II
It's not just allegations of sign stealing via an Apple Watch that the Yankees have brought forth.
After Doug Fister's outing Friday at Yankee Stadium in a 4-1 Red Sox win, the Yankees went to MLB with a complaint about what they thought to be an earpiece -- some sort of impermissible audio device -- that Fister was using, baseball sources with knowledge of the complaint told CSNNE.
The purported audio device was a mouthguard that Fister was wearing wrapped around their ear.
The YES Network's telecast captured Fister walking around in the Sox dugout in the top of the eighth inning, once their outing was over, with the mouthpiece lodged around their ear. It did give the appearance of a bulky hearing aid, but also was not a mystery that required MLB's involvement to solve.
A review of the telecast did not show Fister ever took the mound Friday with the mouthguard around their ear.
Fister, who is scheduled to start Thursday vs. the Blue Jays, was not in the clubhouse by the time the media arrived after a 19-inning, 3-2 Sox win early Wednesday morning.
Land Rover Reveals Transparent Trailer Tech
Ever had to pull a trailer? It can be a nightmare!
For people without experience pulling trailers, and the income to buy a Range Rover, you can finally relax. Your next-gen Range will have some special tech to ensure you don't cut off that Hyundai Accent behind you. Using a trailer-mounted camera, your rear-view mirror will now give you an unobstructed view of the road behind you, how fancy is that?
In addition, Land Rover has blessed the equestrian community with lovely “Cargo Sense” monitor which allows you to make sure Seabiscuit isn't getting too hot on the way to the Kentucky Derby. The system is actually designed to detect abnormal conditions in the trailer, which would then warn the driver via the in-dash display. This should calm the nerves of those Range-owning Horse-riding Canadian clients. It's kind of hard to believe that this system is new, I've certainly never heard of it but I also don't cart horses around, but kudos to Land Rover for thinking about our hooved friends.
Dr Wolfgang Epple, Director of Research and Technology, Jaguar Land Rover, had this to say regarding the new tech
Many of our customers tow valuable cargoes for business and pleasure, so we are researching a range of technologies that would enhance the towing experience and make it safer – for the driver and even their horses. A permanent video feed through to the dashboard from the trailer has the potential to distract the driver from the road ahead. Instead we are developing a more intelligent system that is able to detect a problem with the horse in the trailer and warn the driver. The video is then available for owners to view the inside of the trailer and support a decision to pull over and check the horse.
Also coming with this horsey-saving option is a phone app, which will provide you more details related to Mr. Ed's condition and possibly their mood before you open that door and get kicked in the face. How thoughtful! Here's their Youtube video, displaying pretty much everything I already touched on.
And if you prefer images, here's a gallery of the same stuff.

Jules Verne predicted the Apollo missions to the moon. Star Trek predicted cell phones, tablets, and other modern gadgets. And Knight Rider predicted automotive technology that was science fiction in the 1980s, but is common in the cars of today.
Growing up, I was a nerdy kid who liked computers and cars. I loved Knight Rider. The Hoff is okay, but KITT is where it's at for me. Knight Rider showed me that computers and cars can be cool, despite the ridicule I got from peers for my nerdy interests.
The show hasn't stood up well to the test of time. The 2008 remake of the series was a flop. Most of what Knight Rider has going for it these days is the 1980s nostalgia factor. Regular Car Reviews recently checked out a KITT replica.
[brid video=”61093″ player=”4063″ title=”1982 Knight Industries Two Thousand Regular Car Reviews”]
Mr. Regular's conclusion was basically that the 1982 Pontiac Trans Am that KITT is based on is a lousy car, but who cares? It's KITT, it looks great on TV, and that's all that matters. I agree with him.
Much of what made KITT look great on TV was all the assorted gadgetry on board. It was all very futuristic in the 1980s, but some of KITT's features have become real, or could be very soon.
What's Real
It may have been futuristic or impossible in the 1980s, but you may already have some Knight Industries technology in your own car right now.
Navigation
Let's start with the most obvious example. Michael Knight often would pull up a map on KITT's one or two screens (depending on which season you're watching) to plot a course or track the bad guys. Navigation is available today on all but the cheapest new cars. Even my Subaru BRZ, one of the cheapest sports cars you can buy new, includes navigation as standard equipment. If you don't have it, you can use your phone, or a standalone GPS unit.
In fact, there used to be a Knight Rider GPS available from Radio Shack, complete with KITT's voice of William Daniels calling you by name and telling you where to go. I wanted one of these so badly, but I couldn't justify the steep price tag.
Voice Synthesizer
Talking cars existed even before KITT's time. Nissan was way ahead of the game on this, with their infamous “Your door is a jar” (no it's not, it's a door) voice warning in Z cars and the Maxima. I even found this video demonstrating a voice warning on a 1981 Maxima, from before Knight Rider even aired!
[brid video=”61100″ player=”4063″ title=”Maxima Diesel Vintage Voice Warning System”]
Of course, today's voice systems are much more sophisticated than simple warning phrases. With more and more laws prohibiting the use of handheld devices while driving, hands-free systems are becoming more and more advanced. About all I trust my BRZ to do is make a phone call. It's easier to pull over and use the touchscreen to program its navigation than to fight its clunky voice command system (I usually use Waze instead). But SYNC 3 in the Ford Focus ST I recently tested worked rather well for setting a navigation destination as well as for phone calls. Though not the witty banter between Michael Knight and KITT, it got the job done of basic two-way voice communication between human and car. If that's not good enough, you can just ask Siri.
Automatic Window Tint
For privacy, or to hide the fact that KITT was driving himself, the windows could automatically change from transparent to opaque and back. Wouldn't this be a great way to get out of a window tint ticket?
[brid video=”61147″ player=”4063″ title=”Electric Auto Tinting Switchable Window by EAT International”]
Well, you can! Companies such as EAT Glass offer electric window tint systems that work exactly like KITT's. No guarantees about dodging that ticket, though.
Molecular Bonded Shell
According to Wikipedia, “KITT is armored with “Tri-Helical Plasteel 1000 MBS” (Molecular Bonded Shell) plating which protects them from almost all forms of conventional firearms and explosive devices.” This allowed KITT to drive through all kinds of nasty conditions, from vehicle contact to gunfire to explosions and even through walls, without even suffering a scratch. And as anyone who has ever owned a black car knows, that's a particularly difficult color to keep clean.
Though the BMW X5 Security doesn't look nearly as pretty as KITT after getting shot up, it still keeps its occupants safe from harm. Best of all, unlike a military vehicle, the X5 Security doesn't look any different from a standard X5. Several manufacturers offer vehicles resistant to attack, and there are companies that can add such protection to pretty much any car you bring them.
Convertible Hardtop
In season four, RC3 added the “C” button to KITT's dashboard, which transformed the T-topped car into a sweet looking convertible.
[brid video=”61114″ player=”4063″ title=”1959 Ford Fairlane Galaxie Skyliner Retractable Hardtop Convertible Classic Car”]
But retractable hardtops are nothing new. All the way back in 1959, the Ford Fairlane Galaxie Skyliner had a retractable hardtop very much like KITT's. It wasn't until more recently that these started to become common, though. The Mercedes SLK re-introduced the concept, and since then manufacturers from VW to Lexus have introduced their own versions. Even the last generation Mazda Miata could transform from a convertible into a coupe with its power retractable hardtop option, and we've already gushed over how awesome the MX-5 RF is.
Variable Aerodynamic Bodywork
Another season four “improvement” was KITT's Super Pursuit Mode. This radically altered KITT's bodywork to allow a top speed of 300mph. To me, it looked like KITT was falling apart, which is a more realistic state for a 1982 Pontiac. Trust me – my first car was also a 1982 Pontiac, though mine was a 6000, not a Trans Am.
[brid video=”61116″ player=”4063″ title=”McLaren P1 Rear Spoiler Transforming From Road To Race Mode”]
Modern supercars have spoilers and wings and things they can adjust on the fly for better grip and aerodynamics at high speeds, just like KITT's Super Pursuit Mode (and much better looking, in my opinion). It's not just supercars, either. The Porsche Boxster has an automatic wing that deploys at higher speeds. So did the Volkswagen Corrado. And though the Ford Focus ST has no visible variable aerodynamics, it can open part of the grill for extra cooling when needed, or shut it to improve aerodynamics. We're living in the future, my friends.
On the NYT's homepage, the story of the ongoing protests in reaction to the burning of Korans at Parwan prison occupies a fairly prominent position.
What you won't find anywhere on the NYT homepage, though, is the story of how the NYPD monitored local response to Dutch cartoons of the prophet Mohammed, culled from informants at mosques across the metro area and summarized in a report for Ray Kelly. It's a similar story–the Muslim reaction to perceived blasphemy–but it's local. The NYT's own city. Yet the NYT doesn't consider it news.
Nor will you find a report on the NYPD's press conference yesterday, an effort to insist all this surveillance of First Amendment speech is perfectly legal. Both the NYPost and the NYDN reported on that. (Admittedly, the WSJ is silent on the story today, though they have reported on it before.)
The New Jersey press was reporting on the NYPD's spying in their own neighborhoods, both Newark–in the AP's latest installment, Paterson.
Has the NYT moved to FL for the winter? Because every newspaper in the NY area seems to think this is news.
I've noted before the contortions the NYT went through to downplay (or even dismiss) this spy program in a profile of Ray Kelly. That almost felt like petulance over being beat–except for a few stories from Michael Powell–on a big story in its own backyard.
But the NYT's silence on the story is beginning to get creepy.
Earlier in this series we looked at some Horns sets that the Nuggets have run this season, Horns Lift & Horns Flex. Mike Malone has a great Horns series and this set is another one designed to get Danilo Gallinari into a Pick & Roll. This set is called Horns Italy because the pindown into a step ballscreen is a very common action throughout Europe, and Gallinari is from Italy so it helps me remember the action by this name.
Starting off with a pass to the elbow, Gallinari walks their man in and sets a cross screen for the opposite wing. This screen is really more of a quick pause and then exiting out of the downscreen from the opposite big. Boston used this action for Paul Pierce scores when Doc Rivers coached the Celtics:
Utilizing this action for Gallinari, after the pindown the big will step up into a ballscreen.
The big who sets a pindown then turns and sets ballscreen for Gallinari to attack off of. This set (as seen in the video) can have multiple different options off of it for high low, and if run with a stretch 4 the Nuggets can empty the side with 4 on it and this set becomes extremely difficult to guard (as seen in the second clip in the video with Arthur hitting a 3, not a steady enough look to run long term, but great action nonetheless).
I like the creative ways Malone uses Gallinari, and next week we will look at another way out of Horns the Nuggets use Gallinari to score.
Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is prepared for a potential U.S. attack thanks to a world-class war machine that relentlessly pursues the enemies of the Arab republic on sea, on land and in the air, according to video evidence currently getting wide circulation on pro-Syrian television stations.
The condition of Assad's Russian-equipped armed forces is unclear after a two-year civil war, and U.S. officials contend that the spirited and forward-looking nation has no appreciable air defenses. But pro-Assad clips show that the London-trained ophthalmologist commands a military force of such reach and power that they will inevitably achieve their father's long-nourished dream of pan-Levantine unity under a Damascus-centered colossus.
In this three-minute clip from Sama TV, a chorus of grateful voices chants the name of Syria's army as the widely popular Baathist regime deploys jets, amphibious forces and great warships against Syria's enemies. Courageous soldiers jump through hoops of flame while the Syrian people unite around the keywords “Homeland,” “Honor” and “Sincerity”.
In another handsomely produced music video, Syria's tanks, paratroopers, gunships and artillery batteries advance relentlessly, through snow-covered mountains, sub-tropical forests and forbidding deserts, against the terrorists, Zionists and imperialists who lust for the ancient land's vast wealth and bounty of natural resources.
The videos come as Syria faces challenges from a Sunni uprising that is supported by many Arab states and may soon receive help from the United States. The highly competitive Arab television market reflects this conflict, with many stations strongly opposing the Assad regime and even some supporters, such as Arabic-language RT, toning down their pro-regime coverage lately.
But media loyal to Assad continue to broadcast evidence of Syrian strength, such as this clip from Shaam News Network, in which a patriotic song plays against images of flying rockets and infantry assaults so intense that ignominious defeat is guaranteed for all the foes of Syrian national greatness.
A sense of Syria's civil as well as martial strength can be seen in this pro-military performance by singer Rami Kazour, set to a flashy modern beat and backed by an eager crowd of Assad supporters. The skills on display could prove important should U.S. President Barack Obama, currently stymied in their efforts to muster support for a military attack, attempt to settle the Syrian crisis by arranging a dance-off.

Certified Commercial General Contractor Suncoast is a State Certified General Contractor and has been one of the premier Commercial Construction Contractors in the Tampa Bay area since 1990. As a Commercial Contractor, in the early years our emphasis was on St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Largo, Pinellas Park, Tierra Verde, Gulf Beaches, St. Pete Beach, Madeira Beach and occasionally Tampa, however, that did not last long and we have had many successful projects all over Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco, Manatee and Sarasota Counties and as far away as Jacksonville and Miami, including many Design / Build projects. New Commercial Construction demands a fast and efficient schedule, often utilizing CPM Scheduling (Critical Path Method Scheduling) techniques. This level of construction requires a high level of coordination between the design team, material suppliers, subcontractors, construction activities, local municipalities and the Owner. As the General Contractor, we orchestrate the coordination between these entities. Here are a few of our noted New Commercial Construction Projects Trademark Metals Recycling - Sutton Yard This project was to build the support structure for a 1,240 ton capacity scrap-metal shear, a machine that cuts steel coming out of a 3' x 3' x 30' hopper like scissors cutting through paper. Due to the terrific impact forces, the shear rests on a 4' thick foundation on 60 concrete piles driven 40' into the earth. The support building houses a hydraulic unit with six pumps and an electrical array that covers a 16' x 8' wall. Trademark Metals Recycling - Acre Iron Yard As a seasoned commercial builder, the construction of this relatively small employee building was not particularly difficult but there were challenges in tying this and the another existing building into the sanitary system, eliminating the existing septic system. The challenge was that the sanitary system was several blocks away and we needed to keep the yard in full operation throughout construction. Suncoast provided all of the design services as well as the construction. RJ Longboat & Sons Construction - New Offices and Equipment Yard Suncoast handled this Design / Build project from the initial stages, starting with the design phase and working with the planning staff, correcting rezoning issues through City of St Petersburg, achieving an approval over some of the staff's unfair recommendations at the City Council hearing, through construction and final approvals.

Qualcomm and the Birth of the Smartphone
Reading Time: 2 minutes
Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs' appearance on the Charlie Rose Show brought back memories of the earliest days of smartphones. Jacobs told rose that they originally proposed adding a cellular radio to the Apple Newton MessagePad. When Apple demurred, Jacobs headed to Palm, then owned by 3Com, where they negotiated a license for Qualcomm to build a phone based on Palm OS.
The original Qualcomm pdQ wasn't very good–I later described it as “a Palm glued to a phone.” It had all the functionality of a Palm 3 PDA and a typical CDMA phone of the late 1990s, but virtually no integration between the two sets of features. As I recall, you couldn't even dial the phone by looking up a contact on the Palm and tapping the number. The only real advantage was that you got to carry one big device instead of two smaller ones. Needless to say, it sold poorly.
The followup pdQ a couple of years later was a more interesting product. By then, Qualcomm had sold its handset business to Kyocera, including the in-development pdQ 2. The revamped pdQ was a much more appealing product. It was much smaller than the original and offered some real integration of PDA functionality. It also borrowed the primitive Web-browsing capability of the Palm VII. Data communication in those days was limited to a theoretical maximum of 14.4 kilobits per second and you often did much worse than that, so the Palm system relied on pre-digested an condensed web snippets.
Interestingly, in the same BusinessWeek column in which I wrote about the Kyocera pdQ, I also dealt with what turned out to be the true ancestor of the modern smartphone. The Handspring VisorPhone was pretty terrible product from the company set up by Palm's founders to build licensed Palm-compatibles. The VisorPhone, $299 with contract (!), was a GSM phone module that slid into the accessory slot of a Visor PDA and added phone and SMS apps to the standard Palm repertoire. Not many people bought it, but Handspring used the design experience to build the Treo 300, the first trule integrated smartphone, and the Treo 600, the first successful one.
CLARIFICATION: Turns out folks at Qualcomm in addition to Paul Jacobs have fond memories of the pdQ. Engineers who worked on the project point out that there was some significant integration between the phone and the Palm including the ability to place a call from the Palm Address Book, a “find and dial” search for phone numbers across apps, Address Book search from the phone dialpad, and APIs to give third-party Palm developers access to pdQ phone features. These features don't sound terribly exciting today, but they were breakthroughs in 1999.
10 things KB Toys sold in 1998!
I don't think many of us realized just how wonderful KB Toys was until it went under. In fact, things that once seemed annoying about the chain became somehow charming in its wake. The disorganized clutter! The over-reliance on old stock! The six different price stickers on every single item!
When KB stores were doing those fire sales just prior to shutting down, it wasn't that much different from how they'd been operating all along.
KB had new stuff and even its share of exclusives, but the overall ambiance was that of a discount center. People like me rushed past the “current” items for the glories of those back aisles, where comparatively ancient toys begged to be adopted. It was glorious!
…which leads me to today's topic.
KB Toys didn't go out of business until 2009, so it's no surprise that they once had a major internet presence. Its online identity wasn't far apart from the real world version. When looking for new things, it always seemed to be our last resort. (Hell, I've been buying Christmas presents online for almost 20 years now, and not once can I remember doing it through KB Toys.)
Still, its web presence had the same charm as the actual stores, with wild discounts, loose categories and an overall lack of polish.
What you're looking at up above is a screenshot of KB Toys' website from 1998, when they were first getting their digital feet wet. The whole point of the site was to drive people to their brick-and-mortar locations. There were no virtual shopping carts, nor any way to order anything online. What remained was essentially a virtual circular, and my God, did I ever enjoy flipping clicking through its pages!
Below are ten toys promoted on KB's website back in 1998. May they fill you with as much nostalgic joy as they did me.
#1: Aliens Figures!
Nothing screams “KB Toys” quite like Kenner's Aliens figures marked down to goofy prices. Certainly many of you will remember seeing these beauts scattered around the store, usually in dented packaging. I've only recently begun to appreciate how awesome that line was, so I'm retroactively mad at myself for skipping these sales. Three Aliens figures for ten bucks? Even by 1998 standards, that was INSANE.
#2: Marvel Universe Figures!
Several times before, I've written about my distaste for the Marvel/X-Men figures' total takeover of KB Toys. From the mid to late ‘90s, it seemed like 75% of the entire store was dedicated to these guys, which were perennially on clearance and always in the giant metal bins right at the front.
I remember them selling for as low as five for ten bucks. It was around that time that I got into swapping action figures with other collectors online, and given how cheap X-Men figures were, they became our go-to items whenever we needed to balance out nearly-equivalent trades. Guys in prison had cans of tuna; internet toy geeks had KB's X-Men figures.
#3: Machine Wars Transformers!
If I'm not mistaken, the entirety of the Machine Wars Transformers line was exclusive to KB Toys, serving as a semi-resurgence for classic Autobot and Decepticon characters. (Meaning, Optimus Prime and Megatron were back, albeit with unfamiliar vehicle modes.)
Sadly, Beast Wars was really the last time I paid attention to “new” Transformers things, so my exposure to Machine Wars is pretty limited. (Apparently, I'm not alone. From what I've read, Machine Wars toys didn't sell well at all. That's what happens when you turn Soundwave into a tank.)
#4: Mummies Alive Figures!
Depending on your point of view, Mummies Alive (properly styled with an exclamation point at the end, which I'm ignoring) either came out ten years too late or ten years too early.
In 1988, a cartoon and toys about mummies in the modern world would've fit right in.
In 2008, even if it didn't, fans could've sung its praises all over the internet, inspiring new people to take notice.
Unfortunately, it didn't stand much of a chance in the late ‘90s, surrounded by trends that didn't suit it, and no good avenues for grassroots support. Judging by the cartoon's amazing intro, that seems like such a shame. It even had a snake-headed guy!
#5: WWF “Yokozuna” Figure!
Part of KB's site was dedicated to their past exclusives, including this fantastic Yokozuna figure. If you weren't a wrestling fan, Yokozuna was a giant Samoan masquerading as a giant Japanese sumo wrestler, who won most of their matches by dropping their giant ass right onto their opponents' chests. Only 18000 of these figures were made, and KB was the only place to get them. (“Only” 18000? Hard to believe that there were even that many fans interested in a Yokozuna figure by then.)
#6: Godzilla Toys!
Toys based on 1998's ill-fated Godzilla weren't that year's hottest selling, but they may have been the most-promoted. (You can't blame anyone for assuming the film would capture more hearts than it did. It was basically positioned as “Bigger Than Jurassic Park.”)
Say what you will about the film, but at least it gave rise to some great toys. It also gave website builders an excuse to use Godzilla's foot as an image link. “Click on the foot to see more cool stuff” is my new favorite call-to-action.
#7: Cheap Games!
Milton Bradley had a bunch of games that were popular enough to make, but not popular enough to make a big fuss about. So, certain games came in these simpler, standardized boxes, with correspondingly lower prices. They were classic stocking stuffers, even if they fit no stockings. (Many of them are still available today, in virtually the same packaging.)
#8: 10″ Marvel Figures!
I didn't collect the normal-sized Marvel/X-Men figures back then, but even I couldn't resist the 10” versions. Six bucks was cheap, but they were often sold for even less. Action figures half their size had higher prices! Even with the limited articulation and questionable paint jobs, it was hard to pick the “small cool thing” over the “giant mediocre thing.”
#9: Tamagotchi Pets!
As I recall, Tamagotchis were a bit past their prime by 1998, hence the low price. “Virtual pets” were still popular, but by then, there were far too many competitors, including a blossoming little craze known as “Pokémon.” Still, I'll never forget just how wild people used to be for these things. I even remember college students sneaking a look at them during classes, to ensure that their little black monsters had enough virtual bread.
#10: Nintendo 64 Games!
From the site's modest video games section, a selection of N64 games at slightly reduced prices! The two Mario games were must-haves for every single person who owned a Nintendo 64, but all of these titles were quite good. (Well, they had to be, since they were only in this section on account of having been sold more than a million times!)
Dig that late ‘90s website background, too. I remember it well. The one that looked like bloodied tire tracks.
KB Toys would soon remodel its website into something closer to what you'd expect. The war against old enemies like Toys “R” Us and new giants like Amazon forced them to make their entire inventory available online, but in the end, nothing was enough, and the chain shut its doors for good. KB's website is miraculously still online, but these days, all it does is point you to their former competitors. To the victors go the spoils?
Trayvon Martin: Sanford officials, Rep. Corrine Brown meet with Justice officials in Washington
"I am not satisfied with how this case was handled," said Brown, D-Jacksonville, speaking on the grounds of Capitol Hill. They said the crime scene was not properly contained and that has eroded people's faith that justice would be done. "People need to feel the system is fair."
Rep. Corrine Brown, and Sanford city leaders, who met in Washington today withU.S. Department of Justicerepresentatives, said they were committed to finding answers surrounding the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin .
Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett, as they have said for nearly a week, repeated their openness to a federal review of the case. "If I made an error, I want someone to tell me. …
We have opened our books."
Earlier today, local prosecutors announced that they'll have a Seminole County grand jury investigate the shooting. That announcement came about 12 hours after the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it will review the shooting for any possible civil rights violations.
The county grand jury will hear evidence April 10. State Attorney Norm Wolfinger's office, with the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, is reviewing and collecting evidence in the case.
The U.S. Attorney's Office civil rights division is reported to have a team in Sanford now, speaking to people in the course of its investigation. The Department of Justice said in a statement late Monday that it will conduct a "thorough and independent review."
That would not be a murder or manslaughter investigation but a parallel one into whether the shooter, George Zimmerman, 28, violated Trayvon's civil rights.
They were killed about 7:15 p.m. Feb. 26 as they walked through a gated community in Sanford, returning from 7-Eleven, where he'd bought Skittles and a can of Arizona Iced Tea.
Tonight, the national president of the NAACP, Benjamin Todd Jealous, will be at a Sanford church for a town hall meeting with local officials, including Sanford's embattled police chief, a Department of Justice representative, city officials, local prosecutors and members of the community who say Trayvon was a victim of racial profiling and demand that Zimmerman be arrested.
Some members of Congress have urged the DOJ to consider Trayvon's shooting a hate crime.
Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, spotted them while driving down the street and called police, describing Trayvon as a suspicious person.
Moments later, the two got involved in what one witness described as a wrestling match, and Zimmerman shot them with a 9 mm handgun for which they had a concealed weapon permit.
Sanford police have not arrested Zimmerman because they claim self-defense. Investigators say evidence supports that claim. Last week, they passed the results of their investigation to Wolfinger's office, saying they could not find probable cause to arrest Zimmerman on a manslaughter charge.
At a quarter to three on Saturday afternoon, Jurgen Klopp summed up Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Manchester United. United wanted one point and got it, Liverpool wanted three and didn't get it, so United were the happier side.
It sounded accurate at the time, but two hours later, as Manchester City walked off the field at the Etihad Stadium having beaten Stoke 7-2, you wondered if United could still feel so satisfied with their afternoon's work.
It was a day when Jose Mourinho did what many said was impossible and found a solution to Liverpool's defensive crisis.
It turns out that even Simon Mignolet, Dejan Lovren and Alberto Moreno can get clean sheets against teams that keep eight outfield players behind the ball at all times.
The most entertaining part of these regular Mourinho “masterclasses” in the Premier League comes after the game when you get to see Mourinho pretend that their ultra-defensive tactics are not in fact defensive.
Instead, when it was suggested to them that it had been a dull game, they replied that anyone who thought so didn't understand football.
“One thing is an entertaining game for fans, another thing is entertaining game for the people who read football in a different way. That's different.”
Those who read football in a different way would understand that since Liverpool had not abandoned all caution in search of a late breakthrough, they had not really been any more enterprising than Mourinho's side, despite controlling the game for 90 minutes and creating nearly all the chances.
“I know that probably you think we were defensive and they were offensive,” Mourinho said. “Well, you were at home and you don't move anything? I don't know.”
Since Mourinho clearly believes in the kind of football they get their teams to play, you wonder why they can't be more openly proud of it; why can't they just come out and say yes, we were super-defensive – and wasn't it magnificent?
Only Mourinho can say why they try to gaslight people into believing that their team is no more defensive than any other big team. The fact that they make the effort tells you that they think something important is at stake. But you only have to listen to Mourinho and Klopp analysing the same game to understand that they see football in fundamentally different ways.
Right things
Here is Mourinho explaining how United were planning to score, and why they didn't: “I think they [Klopp] did well, honestly. They didn't let the game break. Lingard and Rashford were waiting for the game to be broken but the game wasn't broken.”
And here is what Klopp was telling their players: “First of all you need to work, you need to continue working hard, really hard, and then, at one point, it will happen.”
For Klopp, winning is something that happens when you keep doing the right things. For Mourinho, it's something that happens when your opponent does the wrong thing. The difference of emphasis is clear: Klopp's approach is focused on the self, Mourinho's on the other.
The question is, does this really matter? Is there any meaningful way in which one approach is better than the other?
From the point of view of results, it's impossible to make a conclusive case either way. And while fans are generally more excited when they see a team taking risks, the truth is that they can get behind any style of football that wins. For most of the people surrounding and following the game, the result is the only thing that counts. The question of whether a coach is proactive and self-focused or reactive and other-focused is of strictly academic interest.
There is only one small constituency in football to whom this question really does matter: the footballers themselves.
Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger are four very different managers with different ideas about football, coaching and management. They do however have one thing in common, which is a commitment to helping their players express the best versions of themselves. They want the players to think for themselves because the players are the ones who create the game.
Collective success
By contrast, managers such as Mourinho and Giovanni Trapattoni want the players to do what they are told.
In their view, individual ego is the greatest obstacle to collective success. The football pitch is not the place for self-expression; if you want to see a show, go to the circus. The managers are the ones with agency, the players are instruments of the manager's will.
Mourinho often speaks about their teams' matches as though they were the only one playing. At Anfield, their summary was: “For me, the second half was a bit of chess, but my opponent didn't open the door for me to win the game.”
We know that both approaches can win matches and trophies and plaudits. But which kind of team would you rather play for? It depends on your own temperament.
There are people who prefer being told what to do, as it spares them having to think for themselves. And then there are people who don't like to think of themselves as a piece on somebody else's chessboard.
Many of the big names Mourinho managed at Real Madrid belonged to the latter group. These players, who thought of themselves as the best in the world, eventually tired of playing for a coach who didn't seem to share that confidence in their ability. They felt that they were a big team and they wanted to play like one.
For now, at least, United's stars still seem content to be told what to do.
At the close of 2007, Jake Sigal had a choice to make. They were a product manager at automotive supplier Delphi's consumer electronics group, which manufactured XM Satellite Radio portable players. Then XM and Sirius Satellite Radio announced a merger and Sigal “saw the writing on the wall.”
“I always wanted to start a business,” says Sigal. “My background is in consumer electronics and there are not a lot of consumer products that are made here in Detroit, and I figured, hey, it's time to start my own company.”
So, they took a buyout at Delphi and in January 2008, in the guest bedroom of their home in suburban Ferndale, MI, Sigal launched what would become Livio Radio, a developer of standalone Internet radios. Their flagship products are two specially branded radios—one plays National Public Radio programs and the other plays Pandora, the personalized online radio service that announced yesterday it has hit the 60-million-user mark.
Just a little more than two years later, Sigal has 10 employees, has moved the business out of their home and into an office down the street, and is the recipient of an investment from Beringea, one of Michigan's largest venture capital firms.
The secret, Sigal says, is really no secret at all. It's just to focus on what customers tell you they want, rather than trying to create a need where none existed. People want to listen to Internet radio without being tethered to their computers. Livio provides that service.
“We don't invent technologies here,” Sigal says. “We only make the current technologies that people love more accessible.”
Sigal is 28 years old, but looks even younger, with an athletic frame—he bikes to work every day—and a faux hawk hairstyle. We sat down a few weeks ago in their office, along with a newly hired marketing person who comes to Livio straight from the Detroit Red Wings. Up until now, though, Livio has not really needed any marketing help. Even before the Beringea investment, word of the products has spread through customers and early media coverage that occurred kind of organically.
NPR approached Sigal at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2009 and asked if it was … Next Page »

After a brief “retirement” (meaning, in this case, they worked in television for a couple years), Steven Soderbergh returned to filmmaking last summer with Logan Lucky , a sort of Southern fried riff on their Ocean's 11 heist movies. The film had an incredible cast (including Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, and Daniel Craig), a terrific script, a great premise, and Soderbergh of course. Naturally, it flopped, grossing just $27.7 million in U.S. theaters, less than other, less obviously commercial Soderbergh enterprises like The Informant! and Side Effects .
So what went wrong? On the Recode podcast, Soderbergh placed the blame on the film's marketing strategy, explaining that they decided to invest a large part of the movie's budget on social media instead more traditional forms of advertising. It didn't quite pan out the way they hoped. Here's their quote:
We spent, at my request, a hugely disproportionate amount of money in social media in the digital space as opposed to television. In retrospect, I think that was a mistake ... I think the potential audience for ‘Logan Lucky' doesn't really hang out in that space, and probably would have been better reached through a certain kind of television. I think that audience also believes, if they don't see a lot of TV ads for the movie, the movie is not real.
I think there's a truth to what Soderbergh's saying in that last part. I know I've walked into theaters and seen movies up on the marquee and said “Wait, that movie is real? It's out?” in situations where I haven't seen TV commercials. There's a weird kind of legitimacy that TV ads bring, even if the ads are bad. Maybe it's just the notion that those commercials cost a fortune, and we know on a subconscious level that if a company is spending millions to promote a film that way, there must be something good about it.
Anyway, Logan Lucky was great, you guys all missed the boat. It's available to rent or buy online or on Blu-ray . I endorse any such purchase.
'Break a leg" is a phrase one frequently hears outside theatres and opera houses. Usually, of course, it means "good luck". At the moment though, it's just as likely to be meant literally, as a piece of advice for singers on how to deal with opera critics.
At the heart of the storm enveloping my profession are the remarks made in five broadsheet reviews of Glyndebourne's new production of Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. In a rare example of unanimity each review, including this newspaper's, pointed to a problem with the portrayal of the work's hero, Octavian, who was described variously as "stocky", "dumpy" – and in the case of the Financial Times, "a chubby bundle of puppy fat". Octavian, a male character but written for a female voice and thus always played on stage by a woman, is a tricky role for a number of reasons, not least of which is that a married princess, a young bride-to-be and their country squire fiance are all supposed to find them devilishly attractive, either when they are dressed as themselves – a 17-year-old playboy aristocrat – or as a chamber maid called Mariandel. Oh yes, and the actor playing this improbable Adonis has to be able to sing like a goddess.
In the case of Glyndebourne's new staging, the director Richard Jones sought to make Octavian look a more gauche teenager than a self-assured aristocrat. Tara Erraught, the mezzo-soprano cast in the role, was given a Little Lord Fauntleroy-style, curly wig, a suit too tight in several places, and "bum-fluff" stubble on their chin. Them Octavian runs against what we assume to be true about the character, and in so doing disrupts our understanding of why, in each case, the three other characters want so desperately to get into her, sorry I mean his, trousers.
I'm not here to defend the choice of words some of my colleagues used, but no one seeing the performance could reasonably fail to comment on Octavian's appearance. Indeed, any reviewer not asking questions about this precise point would be failing in their duty to hold the production and its performance to account. None of the reviewers involved dispensed gratuitous misogyny. But this is what, in numerous newspaper articles and columns, radio programmes, and in thousands of tweets and Facebook posts, they stand accused of. Which is ridiculous.
Opera critics, writing in the daily press, usually have between 300 and 500 words to review a production, so there's quite a bit of shorthand involved. And part of that shorthand is a conflated way of talking about stage characters and singers in a single breath.
But even given more space, the problem would remain. In opera, characters and singers are harder to keep apart than in classical theatre. That is because opera is also, or even mostly, about singing. And while when looking at opera we may be furnished with an illusion of stage characters inhabiting dramatic roles, we also experience in a more direct way the particular voices of singers who, while acting with their bodies, are singing in their own voices.
This bleeding of the personal into the abstract, and the blurred lines between theatrical illusion and enhanced physical presence through unamplified voices, may well constitute an argument about why opera critics should be more circumspect than others in their remarks about singer's appearance.
But it is also one of the reasons why opera is an art form capable of generating levels of passion, and beauty, which are unique among the arts. Indeed, given the form's uniquely high production values, and the opportunity for finding life-enhancing beauty in every little physical and conceptual detail arrayed both on the stage and below it in the orchestra pit, we should be straining every sinew in trying to defend it, and its proper criticism.
Last week, NASA's acting chief technologist, Douglas Terrier, visited one of NASA's main contractors in the Houston area, Jacobs. Along with a handful of media members, they spent about an hour touring the company's engineering development facility, where the company supports NASA programs from the International Space Station to the Orion spacecraft.
At one stop during the tour, Terrier learned about a new distiller that might more efficiently recover water from urine during long-duration missions. At another, they learned about new debris sensors that will go to the station to record micrometeorite and orbital debris impacts. And at yet another, they heard about the parachute system that Jacobs has helped develop for the Orion spacecraft.
The Jacobs engineer who talked about the contract said the company had partnered with several Houston-based firms and leveraged knowledge from the region's large oil-and-gas economy. These partnerships, they said, had saved money for NASA over the course of the agency's 11-year contract with Jacobs to design and build Orion's parachutes.
Terrier continued to nod pleasantly along and ask insightful questions. The tour went on. But inwardly, I was taken aback. Surely, it did not take 11 years (and counting) to develop and test parachutes for a spacecraft. After all, between 1961 and 1972, humans went from first taking flight with Yuri Gagarin, to flying Apollo missions to the Moon. And if it was true, what did it mean for where NASA was really going in terms of human exploration?
11 years
It was true. According to NASA spokesperson Barbara Zelon, the contract for the development and certification of the Orion parachute system has been in place for 11 years. This included early concept and trade studies, numerous ground-based tests, and 17 full-scale development airdrops tests required to prove out a wide range of failure scenarios. Finally, Orion has completed three of the final eight human certification airdrop tests and plans to complete human certification in early 2019. So Jacobs is likely to have a parachute development contract for at least 13 years.
In some sense, this is what NASA does. It tests out new technologies on the frontier of exploration and then shares them with industry. For example, Zelon said, NASA has shared more than 300 artifacts, including the design, models, and test data, with the agency's commercial crew partners—Boeing and SpaceX. This has allowed them to leverage NASA's efforts and eliminate nearly all the development work and unique testing. This saves both NASA and the companies money in the long run.
But what does it say about an exploration program that requires 13 years to develop a parachute system? After all, NASA's Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsules all had parachute systems, too, and each was developed within a few years. NASA had a broad base of knowledge to draw on (Orion will probably only ever come back from the Moon, like the Apollo capsules, although it is larger). It seemed like a 13-year contract for parachute development may indicate that the agency really wasn't going anywhere fast.
A “fair” question
After the Jacobs tour, I put this question to Terrier. They did not flinch. “I think it's a very fair question,” they said. ”I think it's a very fair debate to ask if we as a nation are serious about this, and making it a priority. What we've enjoyed is a very constant level of support, but it's certainly not the Apollo or Manhattan-type project to crank this thing out in seven years.”
That is not to say that NASA, or its large contractor base, is less able than it was in the 1960s. Far from it, Terrier said. “I think it's important to realize that the team and the technology and manufacturing base is very capable of doing that, the moment someone flicks that switch. The speed at which we're moving is not limited by the capability of NASA or the contractors; it is limited by the resources and, frankly, the political emphasis.”
Here, Terrier has highlighted the biggest reason why the United States and NASA have not moved beyond the Moon since 1969, or indeed, even sent humans back. Once the Apollo program met its Cold War imperative, NASA's priority sank, and the funding dried up. NASA has been left with significantly less money, relative to the rest of the federal budget, since then. It then tried to cobble together a meaningful human-exploration program in low Earth orbit with the shuttle and space station.
Perhaps the new administration will change this. Vice President Mike Pence has spoken about a renewed human exploration plan along with a willingness to inject more low-cost, commercial space into the mix to push NASA further, faster. Certainly, the potential is there. But for now, at least, the switch has yet to be flicked on.
There are many combinations of romantic and sexual identities.
How's it going, Internet? I'm Carly, one of the newest members of the Freedom Requires Wings team. Very glad and excited to be here!
I guess I should introduce myself: Like I said, I'm Carly. I'm a 20-year-old designer and student living in Maine. Currently I'm in my Junior year of art school, majoring in Graphic Design with a minor in Art History. (If you have any questions about typefaces or Rococo paintings, I'm your gal.)
But you're probably not here to learn about my life. Except for one specific portion of my life: my sexuality. So I will not deprive you of this information any longer. I am a panromantic asexual.
Now, I know what you're thinking: Holy terms, Carly! What does that word vomit mean?!
For those unknown to the world of romantic orientations, and wondering what the hell a panromantic whatever is, have no fear; I shall explain it all.
A panromantic asexual such as myself is an individual who does not experience sexual attraction (ie: asexuality), but is capable of experiencing romantic attraction to any and all genders or sexes (ie: panromanticism).
Many people new to the realm of asexuality generally assume one of two things:
Donald Trump gives two thumbs up to the crowd after formally accepting the Republican Party's presidential nomination. | Getty Trump on Cruz: RNC audience 'would have ripped them off the stage'
Donald Trump has one regret about walking in on the final moments of Ted Cruz's Republican National Convention speech: They wish they had allowed delegates to boo their one-time primary opponent off the stage.
The Republican nominee, in an interview with Mark Halperin for Showtime's "The Circus," said they did Cruz "a big favor" by coming in when they did.
Story Continued Below
"In retrospect, I wish I would have waited another minute. Because they were being booed right off the stage," they said of Cruz's speech.
Cruz, whose wife and father Trump had scorned during the primary process, was given a primetime speaking slot on the third night of the convention, preceding Eric Trump and vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. The speech started with delegates clapping wildly and cheering for the conservative principles Cruz outlined, but the mood in the room soured as it became apparent that there was no endorsement coming, and Cruz was urging delegates to vote their conscience.
Trump had entered the convention hall as Cruz wrapped up their speech, turning some of the boos for Cruz into applause for the nominee, in a memorable convention moment.
"I walked in and the arena went crazy," Trump said. "Because there's great unity in the Republican Party, and people don't know it. Had I not walked in, I think that audience would have ripped them off the stage. I think I did them a big favor."
Trump also told Halperin that they told Cruz their speech wasn't "very good" upon reading it for the first time. They apparently considered taking them out of the lineup before deciding, "that'll be a bigger deal if we throw them out than if they read it and doesn't endorse, what difference does it make?"
Almost everyone interested in the commercial fishing industry is now familiar with Discovery Channel's hit reality series "Deadliest Catch." The show is entertaining, the cinematography is superb, the characters are portrayed as both villainous and heroic and it's filmed in one of the most brutal environments in the world. To average Americans sitting in front of their televisions, "Deadliest Catch" is an interesting documentary in a historically ignored industry. However, there has been a big problem developing in one of Alaska's most iconic fisheries as a result of the show and legislation known as Bering Sea Crab Rationalization.
It's obvious why the show has enjoyed such success, and I commend the captains, crew and boat owners who have been involved in the series over the last decade. But the fleet that appears on "Deadliest Catch" is creating a problem for the 65 or more other crab boats whose crews depend on the Bering Sea crab resource for financial survival but don't appear on television.
Alaska's Bering Sea crab fleet has had a rich and tumultuous history. The king crab boom of the 1970s generated exorbitant profits for all who participated; however, the king crab crash of the 1980s saw these same players scrambling to keep their businesses afloat through diversification into other fisheries. Fortunately, the opilio crab fishery emerged as a saving grace to the struggling king crab fleet from the mid 1980s and well into the 1990s. As the opilio quotas dwindled in the late 1990s, different management plans were discussed to end the Olympic-style fishery that Bering Sea crabbers had perfected.
In 2005, Alaska's notorious Sen. Ted Stevens forced the crab rationalization bill through Congress as a "rider" on a large omnibus spending bill. This very act by the late senator was a shock to many in the crab industry because of the way they circumvented the entire North Pacific Fisheries Management Council process to get this legislation passed. In Alaska, fisheries management is normally addressed through a distinct process by either the NPFMC (federally managed) or Board of Fish (state managed). However, we have seen a number of instances where these councils and boards have been bypassed via lobbying techniques or through the legislative process in an effort to secure a few parties' interests. Most recently, we have seen these sorts of fishery management manipulations with Cook Inlet king salmon allocation between the commercial and sport sectors, but that is for another discussion.
Through Steven's rider legislation two different types of quota were allocated during this controversial change in management structure, IFQ and IPQ. Vessel owners received quota shares (IFQ) based on participation and catch history from previous years in the crab fisheries. Crab processors were also guaranteed the rights to process ninety percent of the crab caught by the vessels that historically delivered crab to their shore plants in Dutch Harbor, Akutan and Kodiak (IPQ). In addition, six CDQ (Alaska's native corporations created by Stevens) groups split up ten percent of the overall crab quotas as they had before rationalization while captains/crew divvied up three percent. Unfortunately, not everyone was happy with the crab rationalization program mainly because of its inherent unfairness (privatization of a public resource), and the fact that quota owners did not have to be onboard vessels harvesting crab.
There have been some very positive aspects and outcomes from Bering Sea crab rationalization, but there are as many arguments supporting and opposing it as there are crabs in the sea. For the sake of brevity, I will not go into them all. I'm concerned here with one that is increasingly becoming more of a problem for the active Bering Sea crab fleet: Discovery Channels hit reality television show "Deadliest Catch."
Quota leasing has become essential to the survival of vessels still active in the Bering Sea crab fisheries. As consolidation within the fleet is increasingly becoming a reality, quota has become available by previous owners of vessels physically selling out of the fishery, but retaining ownership of their quota. In other instances quota owners weren't allocated enough of the resource to continue their vessel operations; thus, boats were sold and the quota they did earn was leased to vessels still involved in the fishery. More recently, CDQ groups have also been buying up available crab quota outside of the quota they are mandated and leasing it to active vessels in the fishery.
Quota is generally leased to vessels as a percentage of the gross income the vessel receives after delivery of the catch. Lease rates or the amount a vessel has to pay the owner for the rights to fish his/her quota are a bone of contention among the active fishing fleet and quota owners, and these problematic lease fees are only compounded by our "Deadliest Catch" fleet. No legislation has been enacted to control what percentage each party is allocated; yet, quota owners realized the high expenses associated with a Bering Sea crab operation warranted a fair share of the profits from the leased quota…until "Deadliest Catch" came to town.
Commercial fishing is a business and quota owners are naturally going to expect their quota to be fished as cheaply as possible. Generally, the vessel pays all expenses (food, fuel, bait, insurance, etc.) out of the percentage that the quota owners and vessel agreed upon prior to the harvesting of the resource. An increasing problem we see with the "Deadliest Catch" fleet is that they are willing to lease quota significantly cheaper than the industry standard. Different species of crab fetch differing lease rates depending on price of the product, quantity, etc. The fall Bristol Bay Red King Crab season of 2013 saw leases fetching owners of the quota 80 percent of the gross profits, leaving a measly 20 percent to the vessel catching the crab to cover expenses and crew shares in an extremely costly fishery. The numbers don't lie when the pie get sliced so drastically. It was rumored on one "Deadliest Catch" vessel that crew shares for Bristol Bay Red King Crab were $2,000 per man. What's the reasoning for this, and who would undercut themselves and their industry so drastically? The answer is: a few in our one and only "Deadliest Catch" fleet.
Essentially, they are a subsidized entity of the Bering Sea crab fleet by the Discovery Channel, and for the show to continue they must have crab to fish, even if it's not profitable. The reason these vessels have driven the lease rates for crab quota down to such ridiculous levels is because the money they make from being on television can afford them the luxury of undercutting their competition.
"Deadliest Catch" vessels expenses for the season are already paid before they leave their docks in Seattle, Homer and Kodiak. Vessels not subsidized by Discovery Channel's deep pockets cannot make the exorbitant lease rates pencil out, and if they do, captains and crew are making wages comparable to minimum wage. Crab fishing in the Bering Sea is far too dangerous and the work is too tough for this sort of pay. "Deadliest Catch" vessels may be losing money or breaking even fishing, but they are making up for the loss through their subsidies from the cable television giant. Sadly enough the reality show is making reality for those involved in the industry a continuing nightmare.
Ultimately, the entire crab fishing industry suffers and precedence is set to continue the never-ending battle of higher lease rates for the vessels still fishing. In a way, I don't blame the vessels that jumped on the opportunity to turn "Deadliest Catch" into a profitable endeavor. Commercial fishing in the Bering Sea is a tough business, expenses run high and dwindling quotas don't alleviate any of the pressure. Extra income can help with boat payments, repairs and unforeseen circumstances; however, their profit is generated at the rest of the crab fleet's expense.
When lease fees continue to increase the entire industry suffers. It seems extremely ironic that the very industry the Discovery Channel is attempting to "document" seeks to destroy and devalue the rest of the Bering Sea crab fleet. Everyone has had their fun watching "Deadliest Catch", but it's been ten embarrassing years of bad press and unprofessional shenanigans for the Bering Sea crab fleet. I'll be the first to say I'm sorry Discovery Channel, but it's time to go back to Hollywood before the damage you have done to the commercial fishing industry becomes irreversible.
Erik Velsko grew up in Homer, Alaska commercial fishing for salmon and halibut in the summers. They graduated early from high school to fish crab in the Bering Sea in 2001. They took a short sabbatical from the winter fisheries while attending college at the California Maritime Academy. After completing school, Mr. Velsko returned to year-round fishing operations in Alaska waters, fishing crab and cod in the Bering Sea, halibut in the Gulf of Alaska, and salmon in Bristol Bay. Mr. Velsko holds a USCG 1600 Ton, Oceans Masters license and Third Mate Unlimited Tonnage license, is a Bristol Bay boat owner/operator and permit holder and owns and fishes halibut quota in area 3A. They also recently became partners in a steel 58' combination vessel based out of Homer that tenders salmon and longlines for halibut. They and their wife Lacey have three young children: Britta, Estelle and Leo.

#FiveSeasonsAndAMarvelMovie: The Cast Of 'Community' Should Be In 'Doctor Strange'
With the news that director Scott Derrickson will be helming Marvel's upcoming "Doctor Strange," comes the immediate follow-up question: who's their star? While the Internet was interested in Jared Leto today, I think there's a far more obvious choice, one who has worked with Derrickson before.
No, not Ethan Hawke from "Sinister." And not their "Deliver Us From Evil" star Eric Bana, mainly because they played the original Hulk before Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo.
I'm thinking Joel McHale.
McHale is one of the leads in "Deliver Us From Evil," and from their work on "Community" perfectly encapsulates the arrogance, humor and sweet sappy center necessary to portray Marvel's a-hole doctor turned sorcerer supreme.
But why stop there? With NBC's "Community" officially dead (that is, until it gets picked up by Hulu), why not bring on the rest of the cast of the sitcom to flesh out Derrickson's "Strange?" Hey, we can call it #FiveSeasonsAndAMarvelMovie:
Jim Rash As Wong
Rash has what it takes to portray Strange's beleaguered man-servant Wong, a character who sticks by Strange no matter what. Also, they're both bald.
Gillian Jacons as Clea
Clea is Strange's on-again, off-again romantic partner. She's strong-willed, and often gets Strange entangled in insane, universe bending adventures. Sounds like Britta and Jeff to me! (And yes, so far I'm basing this all on that one episode where they're magicians, but bear with me).
Chevy Chase as The Ancient One
Strange's trainer The Ancient One has some weird ways about him, often driving Strange crazy; but ultimately, he's the father figure they never had, whether they like it or not.
John Oliver as Mordo
A fellow student of the Ancient One, Mordo is always jealous of Strange, even though he's more powerful — something that's often their undoing!
Donald Glover and Danny Pudi as Luke Cage and Iron Fist
Yes, I know the characters are lined up for Netflix, but how better to introduce them than in a big budget "Doctor Strange" movie? [NOTE: We can explain Pudi previously appearing in "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" as a different character, because twins.]
Ken Jeong as the Dread Dormammu
Who better to take on the villain role than Senor Chang himself?
Star-Burns as Master Pandemonium
Yup.
...And Yvette Nicole-Brown and Alison Brie
I haven't figured out as what yet. Give me time.

It's the first week of the baseball season, finally. Some teams haven't won a game yet, while others have yet to lose. Some teams look like they may never lose a game and others look like they may never score a run. Small sample sizes reign supreme as Trevor writes a Story and Kenta has it Maeda (my sincerest apologies). As far as closers go, there have already been ninth inning blow ups and closers by committee. Some teams have only played two games, but it's been a weird season already.

Closer News Around the League
Philadelphia Phillies
The Phillies have taken 2-1 leads into the eighth inning twice this season but have no wins to show for it. In their first game, David Hernandez blew the lead with a terrible eighth inning. They did not record an out, allowing three runs on a hit and two walks. Two days later, another 2-1 lead disintegrated when Dalier Hinojosa allowed two runs on four hits while only getting one batter out. Philles manager Pete Mackanin said, “these close ones are killing me already,” (source) which does not bode well for their health going forward. There is not much talent in the Philadelphia bullpen, but since any closer has fantasy value, many owners were snatching David Hernandez wherever possible. When they signed with the Phillies, it was assumed he'd be the closer, but the team seems to prefer Hinojosa in that role. However, Mackanin has now said that Jeanmar Gomez will get the next save opportunity. However it works out, all three will likely end up splitting save chances for a team that won't have many. It's a situation to avoid in fantasy except for the deepest leagues.
Houston Astros
The Astros traded just about half of their farm system for Phillies closer Ken Giles. The assumption, and with good reason, was that they would be the team's closer in 2016. Instead, manager A.J. Hinch has anointed incumbent Luke Gregerson the “primary closer” for the team, with Giles working in a setup role. While Giles certainly has more upside and we can assume the Astros didn't ship all of those prospects over to Philly for a setup guy, Gregerson is more than a solid closer in their own right. They saved 31 games last season while posting a 3.10 ERA and 8.70 K/9. Their control is outstanding, as they walked only 1.48 per nine. It's a long season and both relievers are likely to end up saving games, but right now Gregerson is the one to own in the Astros' bullpen. Giles owners shouldn't give up, though, as he'll have strikeout value even in a setup role and may eventually switch places with Gregerson. Interestingly, it took Giles only six batters in 2016 to allow the same number of home runs as they allowed in all of 2015 (2).
Atlanta Braves
Like the Phillies, the Braves probably won't have too many leads to hold this season, but when they do, it looks like most of those opportunities will go to Arodys Vizcaino instead of Jason Grilli. Grilli was handed the first save opportunity of the year on Monday and blew it, immediately after Vizcaino struck out two in the eighth. After the game, manager Fredi Gonzalez said they saw Vizcaino as their primary option at closer. They then proceeded to say that they would use Vizcaino in the higher leverage spots, whether they come in the eighth or ninth inning. Vizcaino is worth owning because they should get the save chances more often than not, but Grilli is always a threat to vulture a save here and there. It's not an all out “avoid” like the Phillies bullpen thanks to Vizcaino's upside, but it's not a great situation either.
Blowups and Breakdowns
Texas Rangers closer Shawn Tolleson got a nice welcome to the 2016 season on Monday, pitching a 1-2-3 inning against the Seattle Mariners for their first save of the year. Their next outing was not nearly as kind. Appearing against the Mariners again, Tolleson was annihilated, allowing five runs on five hits without getting a single out. It could be a while before their ERA looks decent again. Tolleson might be the third or fourth best reliever in the Rangers bullpen, but their job is safe for now.
As mentioned above, Phillies reliever David Hernandez also had a 0.0 innings pitched appearance. They did a little better less terribly than Tolleson, allowing only three runs. Avoid the Phillies' bullpen in fantasy.
Miami Marlins closer A.J. Ramos had an interesting outing in which the box score showed a scoreless inning. Ramos did not pitch well at all, however, in that they walked three guys and threw only 12 of their 26 pitches for strikes. They induced a ground out and a fly out, then was bailed out by a baserunning blunder by Tigers shortstop Jose Iglesias. Ramos should be fine and will have a long leash, as the rest of the Marlins' bullpen is devoid of talent.
Detroit Tigers fans are used to their bullpens giving up leads. Last season's bullpen was so bad, in fact, that not a single member of the Opening Day 2015 bullpen was in the 2016 Opening Day bullpen. The team redid their entire relief corps, trading for veteran closer Francisco Rodriguez in hopes he'd be able to lock down the ninth inning. In their first save opportunity of 2016, K-Rod looked more 2015 Tigers' bullpen than K-Rod, giving up the lead despite coming into a three-run advantage to face the 5-6-7 hitters of the Marlins' order. The 34-year-old's fastball was cruising along at 88 mph and they looked extremely hittable. Their role is safe for now, but with a stable of new arms, the Tigers could turn to someone like Mark Lowe if Rodriguez continues to struggle.

Visiting Jayapur, the Uttar Pradesh village adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, is heartbreaking.
The welded, cast iron chairs in its newly inaugurated bus shelter, ironically designed to prevent vandalism, have been ripped off their joints and used as perches for gambling; toilets installed under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan have been turned into de facto storage spaces for dried cow dung and fire wood, the doors are broken; batteries of solar lamps that provide light to a large swath of the village during night and a motor used for pumping water to 65 families have been stolen.
Less than two years after Modi took this village of 3,205 residents, located 30 kms off their Varnasi constituency, under their wings, their dream of turning it into a model village, appears to have hit a wall of public apathy and adminstrative neglect.
Rustic attitudes
Even the villagers Mail Today spoke to, including the village head, Narayan Patel, failed to offer any concrete suggestions to prevent vandalism or change rustic attitudes other than a meak defence that such destructive tendencies are common in villages across India. 'These things happen everywhere," Patel said. "I keep telling them not to do such things. They don't listen. Those who break and steal things don't do it in front of me. The problem is with the mentality," they said.
Mail Today got a glimpse of this when it spoke to some of the villagers who defended defecating in the open and blamed "poor welding" for the broken chairs inside the bus shelter.
Pucca toilets being used by locals as a storage space or dumpyard. Pucca toilets being used by locals as a storage space or dumpyard.
"Going out in the open feels better. You also need less water," said a villager when asked why the toilets are not used.
Though over 400 toilets including bio-toilets have been constructed in the village under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, only 20 per cent of them are being used by the villagers, according to Satyendra Kumar, a second year B.A. student at Sardar Patel Mahavidyalaya, Badhaini. Most of the toilet fittings including taps have been stolen.
Blame game
A group of village youth, whom Mail Today spotted sitting on broken chairs inside the bus shelter and gambling, claimed that the chairs were not welded properly and denied any culpability on their part. The claim, however, was promptly denied by Kumar, who said the village head had given up the idea of fixing the chairs as miscreants kept on breaking them each time they were repaired.
It was fear of miscreants that forced the local branch of the Union Bank of India to keep its Digital Knowledge Centre, a library cum computer centre, started as a part of its CSR initiatives, shut most of the time. Both the bank and the centre were opened around the time Modi adopted the village in 2014.
"Initially, we used to keep the centre open. Then we started losing books and magazines," said Prosanjit Sheel, Branch Head, Union Bank of India. The library subscribes to seven Hindi newspapers and news magazines apart from agricultuaral magazines.
"Now, we open it for two to three hours a day as per requirement and also make sure that someone is there to monitor. If you leave the library open for two days unattended, all its contents will be wiped clean," said Sheel. The bank too had provided 35 solar lamps, out of which eight batteries were stolen.
"It is quite depressing to see all this. But what can we do? We cannot go and sit behind them to find out if they are stealing batteries or not. If the local administration and police are strict they can prevent such things to a great extent," said Sheel.
Attitudinal change
Even they believe that bringing progress in the village is not possible without ushering in an attitudinal change in the minds of the people first.
"It is true that by adopting Jayapur, Modi has provided villagers with a lot of facilities," said Sheel. Some of them include good roads (the road that leads to Jayapur is surprisingly bump free), self-operated water pumps, a BNL tower, an under-construction, overhead water tank that is big enough to supply water to five nearby villages including Jayapur and an ATM accessed by more than 200 people every day. "But what eventually drives most of the villagers are parochial concerns about individual gains and benefits," said Sheel.
"When the bank was inaugurated, there was a heavy rush to open accounts. Villagers thought that since Modi had adopted the village, they will also put money into individual accounts," they said. "For them (villagers) what matters is 'I' and not 'We'," they said.

During a week which began with news that multiple offensive players were grumbling about quarterback Kirk Cousins, one former Washington player said the locker room wasn't the source of most of the leaks there.
Via Jake Russell of the Washington Post, former Washington offensive lineman Tyler Polumbus said on their podcast that there's a culture of leaking information to the media there.
“You know what the problem is? The front office out there doesn't set the standard,” Polumbus said. “I honestly feel like 70 percent of the leaks come from the front office out there. So then a guy comes out and starts complaining behind the scenes [that] a player does it and it's like, ‘Well, what are you gonna do? Because we all know that half the leaks are comin' from the front office, so maybe you guys can shut your mouth up there and we'll shut our mouth down here.' ”
Polumbus also recalled former coach Mike Shanahan telling a team meeting about their decision to bench Robert Griffin III in favor of Cousins, insisting to their players that the information should be kept secret until game day.
“Literally by the time I got back to my locker and pulled up my Twitter,” Polumbus said. “It was a million different reporters saying, ‘Undisclosed player just told me that Kirk Cousins will be starting at QB this week.' ”
Some of that is unavoidable, as the sport is so aggressively covered by many professional reporters these days. But players also don't feel compelled to live up to any code of omerta if the boss isn't going to.

It was only 2 days ago we posted a questionable email from a Canadian HTC rep that informing a customer that the HTC Droid Incredible (1) would not be receiving an Android 2.3 Gingerbread. Or rather, “was not currently on the list” of devices on schedule for an update. Well, fast forward to today where we just received a Phantip from one of our readers who received an email from a U.S. HTC rep informing them the Incredible is still slated to receive the 2.3 Gingerbread update and that there has been no official release from HTC cancelling this.
Hate to say, “we told you so,” but just like in our previous post — grain of salt, people. It's never gospel until you hear it from an HTC or Verizon spokesperson. Any HTC Incredible users out there excited about this news? Keep in mind, the email from the HTC rep also said there was still no estimated release date but sometimes hope is all we need.
Thanks, Mike!
Cisco announced solid results last week as revenues grew more than 4% and operating income 14% over the same period last year. The networking giant gained revenue market share in both core and edge routing at the expense of rival Juniper Networks - a good sign that its turnaround efforts in shoring up key routing and switching businesses are paying off.
However, macro-economic concerns surrounding the euro debt crisis continued to weigh on network spending in Europe, which accounts for close to 20% of Cisco's revenues. This was however largely offset by sales in the U.S. which showed signs of returning to strength and the emerging markets in Asia-Pacific which showed a strong y-o-y growth of 12%. Enterprise, one of Cisco's key strongholds, grew 6% y-o-y despite the ongoing macro-economic concerns.
The company also added 1,400 employees during the quarter, half of which were recruited in emerging markets. This came on the back of the 1,300 job cuts that were announced last month. Cisco is restructuring its operations in order to cut costs in areas that are not its core focus, making the organization leaner and more efficient. At the same time, it is bolstering its routing and switching businesses in high growth markets through strategic job hires.
We believe that the company is going in the right direction since its core networking products contribute almost 35% to our estimated $23.50 fair value for Cisco, with cash contributing another 25%. With the company's turnaround plans gaining ground, Cisco's stock has risen almost 15% in the past couple of weeks and is now about 25% below our price estimate.
See our full analysis on Cisco
Margins stabilizing
The cost cutting and restructuring seems to be paying off for the company not only in terms of market share gains but also operating margins which are stabilizing at >20% levels, after having fluctuated widely in recent quarters. This increases confidence in the management's guidance of achieving a long-term operating margin in the mid-20s and increasing profits at a faster pace than revenues. Cisco has already realized $1 billion of the total $1.1 billion of severance charges related to the workforce reduction program it had announced in July 2011, and the operating margins should remain fairly stable hereon. With savings achieved on the operating side, Cisco will be able to make aggressive price cuts to compete better with low-cost rivals and gain even more market share.
Fundamentals drive Cisco's future earnings
As for top-line growth, we believe Cisco's fundamentals remain solid due to the ongoing transition from wired to wireless networks, the burgeoning usage of data on both mobile and wired networks as well as a strong demand for cloud-computing routing solutions on the enterprise side. The company recently debuted its virtual cloud-routing and WAN optimization platform under the Cisco Cloud Connected Solution brand to enable businesses that are increasingly looking to move their applications to the cloud at a low cost. (see Cisco's Worth $23 On Cloud Foray And Enterprise Strength) Its recent move to acquire NDS Corp was made to drive device-agnostic video consumption and increase the demand for its routers and switches among service providers that are looking to monetize the booming data demand. (see Cisco's NDS Acquisition Taps Video Demand To Boost Network Equipment Business)
While the macro-economic environment may continue to be challenging (the company remained cautious in its guidance for the future), we believe that Cisco has executed well on its turnaround plans so far and is well-positioned with its new-found focus to gain even higher ground going forward. (see Cisco's Post-Earnings Crash Makes The Stock Look Incredibly Cheap) The company's dominant market position as well as aggressive price cuts have helped it gain market share from rivals Juniper and Alcatel-Lucent in an uncertain economic environment so far and could help it even further when the concerns subside. However, Alcatel Lucent's recent foray into core routers poses a downside risk for Cisco seeing as the former is #2 in edge router market share – a position of strength that it can effectively leverage to provide an end-to-end solution to its customers.

Let's make one thing very clear — eating kale does not put you on a higher spiritual level than everybody else. Speaking recently at the JW3 Speaker Series in London, domestic goddess Nigella Lawson has ripped, yet again, into the cult of "clean eating" and the hazards of equating food with virtue.
The Irish Independent reports this week that the author and television personality has left no room for doubt about their thoughts on deprivation as a lifestyle. "People are using certain diets as a way to hide an eating disorder or a great sense of unhappiness and unease with their own body. There is a way in which food is used either to self congratulate – you're a better person because you're eating like that," they said, "or to self-persecute, because you'll not allow yourself to eat the foods you want."

It's a continuation of a theme she's been eagerly addressing while out promoting their latest cookbook, "Simply Nigella." On Ireland's "Late Late Show" last week, they observed, "When women say 'You have lost weight,' that is not a good thing. Generally I think it's not good if it's thought that being thinner is always better, and then what happens as a result of that is that somehow you're a better person. We've been reading about all this fat-shaming that's been going on. What's important is that you're healthy and you're fully embracing life. If you are naturally thin that's fantastic – but if you have to starve yourself to get thin, it is not good to encourage people to be that shape. I think my views are slightly different because I've seen people get very ill and very thin so I don't equate thinness with healthiness, so I think what looks healthy is when people have a bit of juice to them."
Lawson's mother, sister Thomasina and first husband John Diamond all died of cancer. On their "Late Late Show" show appearance, they added that they realized "later" in life that their mother likely had an eating disorder, saying, "I kind of put two and two together. I knew they had a thing about thinness but I worked it out later. When they were dying they allowed themselves to eat. To wait until you've got a terminal disease to enjoy eating is an awful thing."
Earlier this year, Fast Company first reported that orthorexia — an unhealthy obsession with food believed healthy — was under consideration for entry into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. And while lifestyle bloggers like the Balanced Blonde's Jordan Younger have gone public with their struggles with what they call "disordered eating habits," you need only look as far as the sudden spike in juice joints in your nearest gentrifying neighborhood, the bestseller list, your Facebook friend's epic, incessant accounts from a recent cleanse, or God forbid, the last time you went to a restaurant with a large group of people to recognize how emotionally fraught eating has become.
And no phrase captures our cultural fetishization of food quite like the phrase "clean eating." There's a Clean Eating magazine. An Amazon search for cookbooks deploying those two words will yield a trove of results. You can find thousands of YouTube videos and nearly as many blogs devoted to the topic. Yet as Lawson told the BBC earlier this fall, "I think behind the notion of ‘clean eating' is an implication that any other form of eating is dirty or shameful. I think that food should not be used as a way of persecuting oneself and I think, really, one should look to get pleasure and revel in what's good rather than either think, 'Oh no, that's dirty, bad or sinful' or that eating is virtuous."
Obesity rates — and with them serious health consequences — continue to soar. We are in the throes of a climate change crisis that could be dramatically curtailed by consuming less meat. Eighty percent of Americans eat fast food at least once a month, and half of us drink soda every day. And 20 percent of our meals are consumed in the car. There's no denying our habits are hurting us and the planet. But making the daily act of consuming food into some kind of holy ritual is not helping. The clean eating obsession takes the basic and relatively simple work of making and eating food and turns it into a vicious cycle of self-congratulation and guilt. So especially in this season of indulgence followed by shame, take Nigella's words as a call to sanity. "There are times when you need a slice of cake," they say. "You don't eat it every day but life has to be balanced and not too restricted."
1.66 Million Europeans Put End To Water Privatization On EU Agenda
Staff Note: EU citizens can propose legislation if they show backing from at least one million EU citizens, coming from at least 7 out of the 28 member states. There is also a minimum number of signatories per member state required. Right2Water collected nearly 1.7 million to put ending water privatization on the agenda.
~~~~~~
The first ever successful European Citizens Initiative (ECI) will meet on Monday EU Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič and the European Commission services to discuss with the Commission its response to the demands of the ECI.
The ECI Right2Water has submitted 1.66 million valid statements to the Commission. The representatives of the citizens committee are invited to the European Commission on Monday morning. The European Parliament has a public hearing with the ECI representatives in the afternoon, jointly organised by the 4 committees of the Parliament involved.
The President of the Environment Committee (ENVI) Mathias Groote will chair the event with representatives of the Petitions Committee, the Internal Market Committee and the Development Committee. Over 30 Members of the European Parliament will be able to ask questions and we expect many more to attend.
The organisers and the President of the ENVI Committee will host a press conference on Monday at 14h00 at the Raoul Wellenberg room at the European Parliament (ASP 5G2) with the President of the Citizens Committee Anne-Marie Perret and Maroš Šefčovič, EU Commissioner.

Reddit has launched a revamped self-serve advertising platform that includes improved analytics and a redesigned interface, signs the platform is getting serious about advertising.
Key to the update is more detailed reporting of metrics. Previously advertisers could only view the performance of the campaign over the entire time. Now they can track particular weeks, months, days in addition to CPM, CPC, and click through rates.
It comes at a time when digital advertising has been called into question for the murkiness of the digital supply chain.
Last year Facebook admitted it had misreported key metrics to advertisers, while more recently some of the world's biggest advertisers have halted spend on Google after the company failed to prevent their ads from appearing next to controversial content on YouTube.
The update includes a redesigned interface “to be more user-friendly and easier on the eyes,” the company wrote in a post announcing the update.
As well as better tracking, advertisers can now pay after they post an ad, where previously they would have to pre-pay for the ad and Reddit would bill or refund the difference, a complex process. Advertisers can also for the first time have more than one post per campaign.
The old system will remain in place for the next few months but will be discontinued in the coming months, the site said. Existing campaigns will continue to run, but the campaigns and creatives are not transferable to the new system.
The update comes a week after Reddit announced it would add user profile pages to its company, a personal touch that makes the site more accessible to the internet community, a move that could see it rival social networks Facebook and Twitter.

Local fans of football and public transit are not excited about the BART cars of the future, apparently. As some have pointed out, those blue and chartreuse seats are just a little too close to the colors used by the Seattle Seahawks, who left San Francisco stinging this past NFL season. Naturally, there is an internet petition to fix this.
From the Change.org page:
The Seattle Seahawks are the chief rivals of the San Francisco 49ers. To outfit BART car seats in the team colors of the Seattle Seahawks (i.e. neon green and blue) is an outrage and a slap in the face of every San Francisco 49ers fan who rides BART. We call upon BART General Manager Grace Crunican (who oddly enough worked as Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation prior to joining BART) to scrap plans to adorn BART car seats in neon green and blue and instead choose other colors.
As of this writing, the petition—which was started by a man from Stockton—had a little more than 1,200 signatures.

The most viewed Lindy Hop, Balboa, Blues Dance, and Charleston videos of 2013. Why? Because it's December. More of an explanation and analysis below the list. Also, don't forget to check out the "Lindy Hop News & Noteworthy 2013 Edition" post.
The Criteria
I did a semi-exhaustive search for Lindy Hop, Blues Dance, Balboa, and solo Charleston performed and posted from December, 2012 to the end of November, 2013. That was mostly to include stuff that I couldn't include in last year's wrap up because it was so late, including Snowball and Lindy Focus videos.
I was going to do separate lists for Balboa and Blues Dance but the numbers didn't support it so I just took the top videos from them and combined them into the one list.
I only included videos by and for our dance communities. That was done mainly to exclude stuff from the various versions of Dancing with The Stars and So You Think you Can Dance because none of us want to relive those train wrecks. That also means fancy pants music videos by mainstream artists were excluded because it seemed silly to combine videos being created for different reasons and deliberately targeting a much broader audience. However, you can check out a sampling of them below.
You'll also note that I combined the views of multiple videos of the same performance such as the ones done at the International Lindy Hop Championships, but kept different performances of the same routine separate. That means the four videos of Tommy & Frida's dance at ILHC were combined, but Max & Annie's performance at ILHC and ESDC are still separate.
At first, this list was just going to be a top 10, but I expanded it because I don't expect to do additional video posts based on different criteria like I have in past years because I don't have the time. I just cut it off at 10,000 views because it seems like a nice round number without getting a ridiculously long list.
I will freely admit that this list is probably missing key videos because my search abilities are far from perfect, and many videos aren't properly tagged or labeled. If you have something that fits the criteria above, then post it in the comments below.
A Note on YouTube Statistics
I did a list like this in 2011, but not in 2012 because in the middle of last year, YouTube made a lot of changes to the interface and the way it counted views on videos.
The main change was the length of time needed for a video to be watched before it is counted as a “view.” YouTube did that to encourage people to post more videos of substance that keep viewers on the site. Also, probably to keep views down for the ones with women in bikinis in the thumbnails labeled “Cute Kittens thrown off cliff” that were actually advertisements for Nigerian princes looking to cash checks.
Of course the biggest question is “How did that Collegiate Shag video get to so popular?” If you dig into the public statistics for that video, you'll see that the numbers were pretty typical up until about a month ago when it suddenly exploded. You used to be able to publicly see various view milestones in the statistics for each video like when it was posted on a particular website, but not anymore. Only the video owner can see that now. In the past, I've seen videos blow up because they got posted on random non-English versions of Reddit or Fark. That could have happened here, or maybe it's possible that we're on the cusp of a worldwide Collegiate Shag revival. Or not. Anything is possible.
This does make the views for those lengthy complete Invitational videos pretty impressive, especially since I believe that views are based on a ratio related to the overall length of the video.
Otherwise, there aren't many surprises. If you want to know the secret to making a dance video go viral, then it helps to be a really, really good dancer dancing really well at a really big event. Or get a bunch of friends and make a high quality music video around a highly populated urban area. Or . . . get a major pop music star to feature your dance. Based on this criteria, Max & Annie and Frida & Skye leading an Charleston through Tokyo, Japan for Justin Bieber's next video project could potentially break the internet.
Other Notes
MAKE magazine noticed my tweet about our business model: "Business model for my open source robotics startup: disclose the cost of everything and charge 40% markup. Want it cheaper? DIY!"What that means is that BlimpDuino , the first product we'll be launching ourselves (rather than through a commerical manufacturing/retail partner), will follow that model. I'll disclose the cost of every part and step of the manufacturing process, linking to sources wherever possible so you can do it yourself if desired.So in this case, the cost of the BlimpDuino kit parts and manufacturing are about $70. 40% margin is $28, so we'd charge $98.Let's say you want it cheaper. Although we get volume discounts on most of those parts, I provide links so you can buy single items for not much more, and avoid our 40% markup (you will be paying shipping and taxes with those retailers, so your savings will be less). The automated SMD soldering can't be done as a one-off, so you'd have to do that yourself (not hard if you've got a bit of SMD experience), saving more money. And perhaps you already have some of the needed parts. Great, more cost savings for you!Let's say you want to make your own company and compete with us, charging just a 30% markup, or maybe just 20%. Excellent! All of our source code and PCB/schematic files are open source and licensed to allow commerical use. If you can make it cheaper or better than us, go for it! The more the merrier. The only requirement of the license is that you credit us for the design and link back here.Let's say you're rich and just want to make them and sell them for cost, with no profit margin at all. Also excellent! More robotics blimps for all! The market grows!Our bet is most of you will be happy to pay us 40% for the security and convenience of making and testing the kit for you. Some of you will want to do it yourself, and that's terrific (we areDrones, after all). And, frankly, I'd be delighted if some Chinese company decides to make BlimpDuino and sell it at half our cost, paying us nothing. We don't want to have to make the hardware if we don't have to (no dreams of being a factory manager here), and if someone can undercut us by that amount with the same or better quality, we will happily move on to designing other things where we can add more value. Everyone wins!

Responding to fans on Twitter, Mass Effect: Andromeda producer Fernando Melo reveals that the game's multiplayer will have ‘some' customization options.
A hallmark of the Mass Effect franchise is its deep suite of character customization options. Since character customization is such a key component to the single player story, fans expect a similar level of customization to be available in the online multiplayer mode, but so far BioWare has remained mostly tight-lipped about what to expect from Mass Effect: Andromeda‘s multiplayer. While details are still scarce, Mass Effect: Andromeda producer Fernando Melo has confirmed that the multiplayer in the game will have “some” customization.
Melo confirmed as much in a long conversation with fans on Twitter. Unfortunately, further details on how deep the customization will be in Mass Effect: Andromeda are unavailable at this time, but with the game set to launch at the end of March, chances seem good that BioWare will pull the curtain back on the mode sooner rather than later.
In the meantime, fans can guess as to what customization in Mass Effect: Andromeda‘s multiplayer mode will entail. A likely scenario is that the different multiplayer characters will have alternate skins to choose from, in addition to different color schemes for their armor and weapons. It's possible that these customization options will be earned through actual gameplay, and if not, players may get these cosmetic items through the game's microtransactions.
Hopefully fans don't have to wait too much longer to learn more about the customization options in Mass Effect: Andromeda‘s multiplayer. With the game's release right around the corner, BioWare seems to be releasing information on it on a more regular basis, revealing just this past week that the Asari squadmate Peebee is a romance option, and that one of the new companions is a female Turian named Vetra Nyx.
Considering the rate at which BioWare is releasing information on Mass Effect: Andromeda, it's reasonable to assume that more info on the multiplayer could come any day now. If not, fans can expect to learn more when BioWare launches the multiplayer tech test for Mass Effect: Andromeda a little closer to launch.
Anyone that would like to participate in the Mass Effect: Andromeda multiplayer tech test can sign up on BioWare's website, but even if they miss out, there's a chance the game could have an open beta before launch. It could be beneficial for BioWare to run an open beta for Mass Effect: Andromeda to stress test the servers, if nothing else.
Mass Effect: Andromeda will be available on March 21st for PC, PS4, and Xbox One.
David Hume
Nothing is more usual, among states which have made some advances in commerce, than to look on the progress of their neighbours with a suspicious eye, to consider all trading states as their rivals, and to suppose that it is impossible for any of them to flourish, but at their expence. In opposition to this narrow and malignant opinion, I will venture to assert, that the encrease of riches and commerce in any one nation, instead of hurting, commonly promotes the riches and commerce of all its neighbours; and that a state can scarcely carry its trade and industry very far, where all the surrounding states are buried in ignorance, sloth, and barbarism. It is obvious, that the domestic industry of a people cannot be hurt by the greatest prosperity of their neighbours; and as this branch of commerce is undoubtedly the most important in any extensive kingdom, we are so far removed from all reason of jealousy. But I go farther, and observe, that where an open communication is preserved among nations, it is impossible but the domestic industry of every one must receive an encrease from the improvements of the others.
Frédéric Bastiat
The one thing that people overlook is that the sort of dependence that results from exchange, i.e., from commercial transactions, is a reciprocal dependence. We cannot be dependent upon a foreigner without theirs being dependent upon us. Now, this is what constitutes the very essence of society. To sever natural interrelations is not to make oneself independent, but to isolate oneself completely.
David Ricardo
Under a system of perfectly free commerce, each country naturally devotes its capital and labour to such employments as are most beneficial to each. This pursuit of individual advantage is admirably connected with the universal good of the whole. By stimulating industry, by rewarding ingenuity, and by using most efficaciously the peculiar powers bestowed by nature, it distributes labour most effectively and most economically: while, by increasing the general mass of productions, it diffuses general benefit, and binds together by one common tie of interest and intercourse, the universal society of nations throughout the civilized world.
Adam Smith
The balance of produce and consumption may be constantly in favour of a nation, though what is called the balance of trade be generally against it. A nation may import to a greater value than it exports for half a century, perhaps, together; the gold and silver which comes into it during an this time may be all immediately sent out of it; its circulating coin may gradually decay, different sorts of paper money being substituted in its place, and even the debts, too, which it contracts in the principal nations with whom it deals, may be gradually increasing; and yet its real wealth, the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its lands and labour, may, during the same period, have been increasing in a much greater proportion. The state of our North American colonies, and of the trade which they carried on with Great Britain, before the commencement of the present disturbances, may serve as a proof that this is by no means an impossible supposition.
Republished from Cafe Hayek (Bastiat, Ricardo, Smith, Hume)
Facebook made headlines yesterday when it announced plans to acquire Oculus VR, purveyors of a virtual-reality gaming headset, for $2 billion in cash and stock. News of the acquisition comes just little over a month after Facebook agreed to acquire WhatsApp for $19 billion.
Clearly, Facebook has no bones about going on wild spending sprees, presumably in an effort to ensure its survival as a relevant mobile and social platform.
Of course, what really got the ball rolling was Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram back in April of 2012. Funny, the $1 billion pricetag which seemed astronomical at the time now seems like one helluva bargain.
What's particularly interesting about Facebook's newfound willingness to open its bank account is that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg assured the Facebook faithful that the Instagram deal was an anomaly, an exception to the rule.
If you recall, Zuckerberg in the wake of the Instagram acquisition posted a note on Facebook -- now since deleted -- where they wrote the following.
This is an important milestone for Facebook because it's the first time we've ever acquired a product and company with so many users. We don't plan on doing many more of these, if any at all. But providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love Facebook and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together.
Perhaps adding some context to Facebook's buying spree, the social networking giant in the last two months alone has spent more on acquisitions than Apple has spent during its entire 37-year history.
i do not take any credit for ''inventing dd'' because this is a silly arguement i just put my spin on it
Im not very good at making guides so hope this will answer some of your questions if not feel free to ask em on stream or in here
The way Detonate Dead works to my understanding is you do 18% of the monsters health in fire damage and because i use chance to ignite and other things to increase that percentage of causing an ignited 9/10 times i will burn the mobs after i DD them that ignite will get proliferated with the gem Elemental Proliferation
because i have so much added elemental damage / fire damage and increased burn damage combined with double curse and elemental equilibrium this resulted in a very strong character
Alright guys ill do my best to explain how i did things and why i chose to do it that way lets start with the leveling from scratch since alot of people asked, you cant really use Detonate Dead to lvl with because mobs dont have alot of life yet
thats why i chose to level with Flameblast this spell is very strong low level and does not reqruire much if any gear to make it work this is preferance ofcourse you can lvl anyway you like and transition into DD when you reach maps
this is how roughly how i did it during the 2 week race

Why does reflect not damage me?
simple my artic armour is lvl 25 (lvl 3 empower in +1 wep and 21 artic armour) and i have 85-92 fire resist depending on Purity setup
Also common sense, do not detonate a boss in a reflection map or a rare with a HUGE life pool this will result in foetal position for the next 5 minuts
What kind of gear do you want?
supreme truth is very good because it has 40% ele dmg and the 5% exp is a nice bonus but you could use any other wep that has elemental damage/fire damage aswell
Doryani's Catalyst being Best in Slot ofcourse
I will probably end up buying doryani's invitation aswell the belt from atziri for the 1% leech with fire dmg

If you follow the Polkadot Chair on facebook, you may remember that I shared this photo a few weeks ago of my work table…
The story goes like this:
I was working a pinwheel quilt out of some Denyse Schmidt fabric that I picked up at Joanns and glanced down at the pile of scraps and thought to myself:
“that looks like the 4th of July!”
sidenote: can you name the movie that line “you look like the 4th of July!!” is from? the facebook gals got it right away :)
As it turned out I had a bunch of 9″ tall scraps left over from cutting out my pinwheel quilt blocks. The Fourth was coming up and I thought I'd make my daughter a fun skirt to wear for the day with the scraps. The project was quick and simple to sew. This is what I came up with:
Since each scrap was at least 9″ tall, I made the top tier of the skirt 9″ tall and pieced all out of scraps. Each one of those fabrics is a different width- some are 2″ some are 6″ etc… It just depended on what was left over from the quilt. If some were too wide, I cut them in half. I just kept sewing together scraps until I had the correct width.
I then added a lower tier (that is yardage not scraps) and bias strip bands to the top and bottom tier. It was a bit short so the band on the bottom tier is made from a 4″ wide strip of fabric.
If you would like to make a skirt like this just start with one of my tutorials:
either this one: (from the first days of my blog, an oldie but a goodie!!)
Just replace the top tier of fabric with pieced scraps… all the measurement are the same.
I had so much fun making this one that I might have to dig though my scrap bin and see what else I can come up with.
My background in the comic industry, before coming to work for Bleeding Cool, is a little different than some of the other contributors here. I found myself trying to be a publisher in the late 90s… which was a horrible time to try that. I have written, colored, inked, lettered, done layouts as well as dealing with printers, distributors and conventions. About the only thing I haven't done in this industry is pencils… and none of us want that to happen, trust me. Needless to say I have a better than average knowledge of how this industry works from all sides. And when I have a chance to talk about the industry of comics, I jump at it.
Now I write for Zenescope along with quite a few other publishers and one of the questions I get has to do with variant covers. Those readers who have been around a while all become a bit twitchy when the talk of multiple covers comes up because of the boom/bust of the 90s. A chunk of the blame for the collapse of the industry back then falls on variant and gimmick covers. Zenescope uses variant covers all the time and people want to know why. The last series I did for them, Neverland: Age of Darkness, had three or four covers per issue. The simple answer is because it keeps them in business and allows them to put out books at a $2.99 cover price. It's not just Zenescope though, publisher like Valiant, Boom, IDW and Dynamite use variant covers all the time.
The truth is that retailers order more copies of a book when there are multiple covers and those additional sales can make or break a series for a publisher.
This leads me to a discussion I had this week with Nick Barrucci from Dynamite. Nick is actively going after the Image Comics fans with their Creators Unleashed line. What he's trying to do with the line is a few different things. First he's trying to bring in some big named writers with indie/Image cred like Joshua Hale Fialkov, Peter Milligan, Duane Swierczynski and Rick Remember. He's setting the price point at $2.99, he's making the books fully returnable and he's only doing the one cover. They made the book cheaper and returnable in an effort to get retailers to order as many as possible to get them out to as many readers as possible. In doing so there isn't much of a margin for error, so they can't overprint the book like they normally would.
In our conversation it was obvious that Nick was worried about the initial orders for the latest Creators Unleashed book Terminal Hero. He's never had a problem revealing order numbers, so I asked them what was a comfortable threshold for a $2.99 book, how many orders do they need to make it worth doing? Between 9,000 and 10,000. The current orders for Terminal Hero #1 is 9,852, comfortably in that range. Except it's not issue one that he's worried about. A comic can drop anywhere from 25 to 50% in sales between issues one and two. The reason for this is retailers are more comfortable trying a first issue but are asked to place orders for a second issue before the first issue has shipped. This means it's crucial to get as many fans asking the retailers for the first issues so it carries over to the orders for the second issue.
An example of that is another Creators Unleashed title The Devilers #1. The initial orders came in at 10,000 and after a PR push, final order cutoff (FOC) numbers came in 14,000. So how does that translate into sale for the second issue? The numbers on that right now are at 7,400… that's a 48% drop and well below the range they want it to be in for a $2.99 book.
I had two questions come to mind at that point… and you probably do too. The first one was simple, why not sell the book for $3.99? Other Dynamite books go for that amount. The answer was simple. They really wants these books to get into as many hands as possible. And when you raise the price you will lose some of your orders. You look at another book Nick thinks is severely under-ordered, Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers #1. This book is done by Joe Casey based on the creation of Jack Kirby and has a cover price of $3.99. Initial orders here are only 7,030. The comfortable threshold for a $3.99 book is 8,000. So the current order numbers don't even hit that and issue two will be well below. So just raising the price isn't necessarily the answer.
That led to my second question, why not do variant covers on these books. I expected a financial based answer like the cost of putting in a second cover negates the increase in sales or something like that. But according to Nick the truth is a variant cover or two would help, but they really just wants to make good comics that people buy to read. He'd prefer not to use gimmicks to inflate sales. And since he's going after the Image Comic readers, that's not a publisher who does a lot of variants… some, but not a lot.
So when you are a publisher like Dynamite and you are bringing in 2.3% of the total unit market share for a month, you can take a chance on putting a book out for $2.99, making it returnable and not offer variant covers… but you are counting on the readers to tell the retailers that they want the books and you are counting on the retailers to take the chance and ordering enough of the first two issues before they ever get a copy of the book. And you are printing to order because there is no cushion to overprint. But you only do it on books you really have faith in.
If you're a publisher like Zenescope taking in only .7% of the total unit market share, you don't even risk it and you offer variant covers.
Why do publishers offer variant covers? Sometimes it's necessary to keep a book at $2.99… and sometimes It's necessary to just keep it being made.
Since Nick was so good about giving me numbers for this piece, it's only fair that I tell you that the final order cutoff for both Terminal Hero and Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers is coming up quickly if you want to let your retailer know you are interested.

The idea of a Scandinavian utopia has become a recurrent theme in American media. Countries like Denmark, Norway or Sweden have better quality of life than the United States, some argue, and many Scandinavians enjoy a better work-life balance than Americans. Others point to these countries' more progressive gender equality, affordable education, or their low level of gun crime as examples of Scandinavian superiority.
However, the concept of the Scandinavian utopia hasn't convinced everyone, and as of this weekend the idea has an influential new critic: American rapper Snoop Dogg.
In a series of Instagram videos posted over the weekend, Snoop detailed how they had been briefly detained in the Swedish town of Uppsala on suspicion of possessing marijuana after a show on Saturday. While Snoop was released after taking a urine test at a local police station, they had no kind words for their treatment, accusing officers of racially profiling him.
Snoop told their Swedish fans they would "never be back to your country, it's been real."
Whatever the exact circumstances of Snoop's situation, they aren't the first to suggest that racism is an issue in Sweden. In recent years, the country's attitude to race has sometimes been confounding to outsiders. In 2012, Swedish culture minister Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth faced calls to resign after eating a cake that depicted a naked black woman (the artist behind the cake, a black Swedish man, said that the cake had been misinterpreted). Earlier this year, Sweden's Ornithological Society announced it would be officially renaming several birds with racially offensive Swedish names.
As strange as those examples may be, a series of arson attacks earlier this year were a reminder that racism and xenophobia could have very real effects in the country. "We have a feeling that society is turning against us," a Somali-born imam at one of the destroyed mosques told The New York Times in March.
These attacks do seem to suggest a shift in Swedish society. For decades, Sweden has shown a truly remarkable willingness to become a refuge for those fleeing from persecution or war. Officially neutral during World War II, the country accepted Jews and anti-Nazi activists with open arms and this national policy of openness has continued until the 21 {+s} t century — in 2013, the country was by far the largest recipient of asylum-seekers per capita of any country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, accepting almost all refugees from Syria, for example.
However, recent electoral results show that not everyone in Sweden is happy with having such an open society. In last year's general election, the far-right Sweden Democrats won 13 percent of the vote, becoming the third-most-popular political party in the country. That party has capitalized on anti-immigration sentiment and, critics say, its roots in Swedish fascism and white supremacy — one party candidate had to resign recently after a photograph emerged of them wearing a swastika.
The rise of the Sweden Democrats may conflict with the view many Swedes have of their own society as an open and tolerant place, but some say that old viewpoint clouds the problem of racism in the country. "It is our view that the Swedish philosophy of equality and its public and self-image as a country with non-discrimination and liberal democracy blinds it to the racism faced by Afro-Swedes and Africans in its midst," the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent concluded in a report last year. "No country is free of racism, and Sweden is not an exception."
Swedish police officers have been accused of racism before. In 2009, a local Swedish newspaper found that two offensive names ("Neger Niggersson" and "Oskar Neger") were given to imaginary suspects during an official police training exercise. After riots hit the Stockholm suburbs in 2013, there were claims that the officers at the scene had used words like "monkeys," "rats," and the n-word to refer to non-white rioters.
As China and Japan spar over control of a group of tiny islets in the sea between them, the deeper issue is really the question of which of Asia's two biggest economies will gain control first of the valuable oil and natural gas located there.
Since mid-September, a number of Chinese ships have sailed close to the eight uninhabited islands in the East China Sea in order to assert Beijing's claim there. Japan now controls the islets, known as the Senkaku in Tokyo and the Diaoyu in Beijing. Japan's announcement in September that it was buying the Senkaku, sparked mass street protests in China and a diplomatic crossfire so intense that US officials have urged calm.
“If they could get it, oil and gas would be hugely important,” says Liu Chia-jen, petrochemicals analyst with KGI Securities in Taipei. “But whoever makes that move will run into trouble,” they say, adding that because of those tensions, the potentially enormous oil and gas fields in the region are likely to stay untapped for a while.
China is the second largest net importer of oil after the United States. Heavily-industrialized Japan is the third.
Years of rapid growth has sent China's fuel consumption soaring, and the country has been quicker than Japan in plumbing the East China Sea. Japan, which has relied heavily on nuclear power, has also seen its oil usage jump since its nuclear power plants went idle after the Fukushima nuclear power plant crisis last year.
How much is under the sea?
Just how much oil is at stake in the East China Sea is uncertain.
CNOOC Ltd., a Chinese offshore driller, listed its East China Sea proven oil reserves at 18 million barrels and gas reserves at 300 billion cubic feet last year.
The US Energy Information Administration, meanwhile, estimates that the East China Sea has between 60 and 100 million barrels of oil in “proven and probable reserves” and 1 trillion to 2 trillion cubic feet in natural gas reserves.
“No one really knows how much is there because the disputes have discouraged exploration,” says John Pike, director of the US-based public policy organization GlobalSecurity.org.
And because of the tensions in the region, only 2 to 3 percent of the world's total oil discoveries have come from the 482,000-square-mile East China Sea spanning from Taiwan to Japan to date, Mr. Liu says.
The Senkaku dispute highlights an unsettled history between Japan and China. China claims that Japan has not adequately apologized for World War II-era aggression, though Japan says it has atoned, for example.
Requests for resources from Japan are stalled because of a “lack of a satisfactory settlement of the historic legacy, that is to say lack of an apology from Japan,” says Joseph Cheng, political science professor at City University of Hong Kong.
China and Japan have been successful at working together to tap large oil fields in the region in the past: China discovered the Pinghu oil and gas field in 1983, and its production there peaked at between 8,000 and 10,000 barrels per day in the late 1990s, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. Japan co-financed two pipelines from the Pinghu field to China through a regional development bank and a Japanese lender for international cooperation.
Today's competitors also signed a deal in 2008 on sharing resources from an East China Sea gas field called Chunxiao by Beijing and Shirakaba by Tokyo. But they couldn't figure out how to work together on it, and two years later Japan accused China, which had drilled in the field since 2003, of going ahead on its own.

China and Japan could use another agreement, suggests Scott Harold, associate political scientist with the American think tank RAND Corp.
“Until the two sides can reach a deal on exploration or extraction, it's unlikely anyone will be pulling much of value out of the seabed,” Mr. Harold says. Otherwise, they say, “one missile or one well-armed ship could take out an adversary's rig.”
At first glance, it looks like candy you would buy at the store, but 10TV learned some are laced with a potent drug.
Now, drug experts are worried that kind of candy is coming to Ohio and may catch unsuspecting parents and children off-guard.
Those candies are laced with the main ingredient found in marijuana, THC, and they are legally made out west. The concern is who they're targeting.
A national movement across the country to legalize marijuana is also being felt in Ohio. In fact, some Ohioans are trying to get a similar petition on the ballot.
Despite the law, some fear that - with the power of the internet - those drug-laced candies are close by.
Marcie Seidel, with Drug-Free Action Alliance, say the drug-laced candies are a way for people pushing drugs to reach a new, and much younger clientele.
“This, we believe, is the beginning, the overt process that's starting the big commercialization of marijuana in our states,” said Seidel.
With clever names like "Stoney Rancher," “Pot Tarts," and "Krondike," they appear to be kid-friendly food.
“It has the real labeling and look to the real ice cream bar, but it has THC in it,” said Seidel.
So, the real concern is now for parents and teachers, when they see their children reaching for a candy bar or biting into a couple of cookies. The question is - are they real or are there drugs inside.
“The danger of this, is that when you put it in a form that is truly a child's product, then you're going to have children that are going to get involved and using it,” said Seidel.
Seidel says using the drug at a young age can land an unsuspecting child in the hospital and stunt mental growth.
They fear - with 20 states already allowing medical marijuana, including our neighbor to the north - it's only a matter of time before it enters Ohio, without anyone even knowing it.
“They can walk down the street, they can go to school, they can sit in the classroom, they can eat this, they can get their high, and no one's any the wiser,” said Seidel.
So far, several Columbus-area police departments tell 10TV they haven't come across the commercial candy laced with drugs.
However, authorities warn that if parents see their kids suddenly having a love for lollipops or chocolate bars that they've never had before, make sure to check the candy closely for any extra ingredients.
Our feelings serve to draw our attention to messages. These messages can be good, bad or indifferent. The intensity of the feelings serves as a call to how urgent we should attend to these messages. An analogy would be the mistaken act of burning your thumb on a hot stove, while cooking. The intense pain you would feel from this incident would be the nerve endings in your thumb, calling your attention to the fact that you are cooking your thumb. This would lead to you instinctively taking your thumb away from the hot stove, examine the damage and seek immediate relief from the pain. So in this analogy the pain would represent the feeling with the message being the burnt thumb.
To further expand on this analogy, the feeling of pain was a sensation produced by the properly functioning nervous system in response to a part of the body being exposed to excessive heat that was resulting in damage to that part of the body. So in essence the feeling was internally generated as a result of the incident. Given a similar analogy with the difference being a non working nervous system, there would be no pain which would most likely lead to permanent injury.
When you experience psychological feelings, it is a result of a proper functioning neurological network in response to a specific stimulus or stimuli. Feelings whether joy, sadness, indifference or rage exist to draw our attention to a message. The more intense the feeling is, or the more emotionally aroused you are the more urgent the message is. So if you receive good news, like the birth of a new family member, you would most likely experience feelings of joy. Your feelings of joy would draw your attention to the message that something important and good just took place in your life. Same thing if you go to work on Monday and you were let go, you would surely experience negative feelings which would draw your attention to something unpleasant and serious taking place in your life.
We generate our own feelings, as a result of the interaction between our beliefs and our experiences. So it sends a self defeating message when we hold others accountable for our feelings. The only way for another person to hurt us is to visit physical pain upon our personhood, however as far as hurt feelings are concerned, we simply experience pain when we perceive things are not going our way.
When we focus on the fallacy regarding how others hurt our feelings, we fail to attend to the message our feelings are sending to us and we emotionally regress to the mindset of infants, where there is a strong expectation that our feelings are supposed to be attended to by someone else. In this mindset we risk further exposing ourselves to more hurt, pain and shame which leads to a vicious circle.
The answer is unconditional acceptance of self with positive regard. You accept yourself unconditionally simply because you exist. Doing so allows you to get past difficult feelings and examine the messages they are trying to convey.

Augusta, Georgia (CNN) Reality Winner pleaded not guilty in federal court Thursday to one charge in connection with removing classified material from a government facility and giving it to an unauthorized person.
They were denied bail.
The 25-year-old federal contractor was charged with leaking information regarding a 2016 Russian military intelligence cyberattack to The Intercept, an online news outlet.
 They are accused of revealing classified information, used as the basis for an article published Monday by The Intercept, which detailed a classified National Security Agency memo. The NSA report, dated May 5, provides details of a 2016 Russian cyberattack on a US voting software supplier, though there is no evidence the hack affected any votes.
Assistant US Attorney Jennifer Solari said it is unclear how much material is involved in the case. Authorities are looking at two laptops, a tablet and four cellphones seized from Winner's home as well as spiral-bound notebooks.
The charge, willful retention and transmission of national defense information, could bring Winner up to 10 years in prison. They could also face a fine of up to $250,000.
Winner, dressed in an orange jumpsuit with the word "Inmate" on the back, spoke very little to Judge Brian Epps. They stood with their hands behind their back and said, "Yes, your honor" when asked whether they have gotten a lawyer.
Solari told the judge that Winner had admitted to FBI agents during their arrest that they sought out classified information.
According to Solari they told them they were "mad about what they had recently seen in the media" and they "wanted to set the facts right."
The US attorney also alleged that Winner once searched on their work computer, while they were still in the Air Force, for the phrase: "Do top secret computers detect when flash drives are inserted?"
And there was a notation in one notebook, Solari said in which Winner purportedly wrote, "I want to burn the White House down."
Winner's mother, Billie Winner-Davis, told the court their daughter had never been in any trouble and was at the top of their class throughout their school days.
Them stepfather said Reality Winner never expressed unpatriotic thoughts and "is a good person."
Twitter posts curtailed while at new job
The Intercept provided the US government agency with a copy of the document, according to the complaint. The news outlet later said it did not know the identity of the person who gave it the document.
Winner served in the Air Force from December 2010 to 2016, leaving as a senior airman who was a cryptologic language analyst.
They provided support to missions and received the Air Force Commendation Medal in 2016, which is for members who have "distinguished themselves by meritorious achievement and service."
Recently they were a contractor with Pluribus International Corp. in Augusta, Georgia.
On Twitter, Winner posted about leaks and regularly took to social media to blast President Donald Trump, though their Twitter activity dropped off significantly after they began working for Pluribus in February.
Winner posted under a pseudonym, Sara Winners, but didn't seem concerned with concealing their identity, using a photo of themselves as a profile picture and posting a selfie in February.
Winner followed Edward Snowden, WikiLeaks, several accounts with links to the hacking collective Anonymous, and several "alt" government agency accounts that became popular after Trump's inauguration. Many of the accounts claim to be run by agency employees unhappy with Trump.

Unclaimed money, red-light cameras a pub crawl were discussed at the May 30 meeting of the Gladstone Park Neighborhood Association.
"Right now $2.5 billion, that's with a capital ‘B,' belongs to Illinois residents," Illinois Treasurer's Office marketing representative Barbara Chalko said of the state's "iCash" program.
Residents and business owners can check to see if they have unclaimed funds at icash.illinoistreasuer.gov. "Usually one out of four persons find money," Chalko said.
The state keeps the funds until the original owner or an heir submits a verifiable claim, and in many instances the funds represent unpaid wages, bill overpayments or uncollected money from insurance policies.
In some instances the state may search for the owner.
The treasurer's office called a 92-year-old woman who had $250,000 in unclaimed funds, but they hung up the phone, presumably because they suspected a scam, Chalko said. Eventually a state senator helped to locate a relative of the woman, and the money was returned, they said.
In other cases, the state may seize an abandoned safety deposit box and save any funds.
Other items in the boxes, which can include baseball cards, coins and other collectibles, may be auctioned, and the money paid for the items is saved until a proper claim is made. The treasurer's office has two investigators who open abandoned safety deposit boxes and record the contents.
Unclaimed military medals are not sold, and the treasurer's office recently returned a Purple Heart to the son of a Vietnam War veteran, Chalko said.
Chalko also reported that the treasurer's office has a program intended for charitable groups which provide food, housing and workforce development. Grants of up to $25,000 are available, and the program is funded through filing fees collected from nonprofit agencies when they register with the state.
The office also has a new savings program for those with disabilities, and the money accrued does not affect an applicant's eligibility for federal assistance, Chalko said.
Also at the meeting, association officials encouraged members to attend a Wednesday, June 14, community meeting on a proposal to install red-light cameras near Milwaukee Avenue, Central Avenue, Foster Avenue and Northwest Highway. The meeting will be held at 6:30 p.m. at the Copernicus Center, 5216 W. Lawrence Ave.
Accident and traffic data for the intersections will be presented at the meeting, and representatives of the city Department of Transportation will be available to answer questions.
The association will hold its first pub crawl Thursday evening, June 15. Tickets are $20 and can be purchased at the association's new Web site at www.gpnachicago.org.
Tickets include a tee-shirt, food and raffles, and drink specials will be available at each establishment. The event will take place from 5:15 p.m. to 6:15 p.m. at Vaughan's Pub, 5485 N. Northwest Highway, 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at Jimmy Mac's Bar and Grill, 5581 N. Northwest Highway, and 7:45 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. at the Highway House, 5653 N. Northwest Highway.
The association's next meeting will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday, June 27, at the Rosedale Park fieldhouse, 6312 W. Rosedale Ave.
The Bus Network Redesign in Indianapolis Will Be Like Launching a Brand New Transit System
The vote to approve a transit funding ballot measure last November was a watershed moment for Indianapolis. After nearly a decade of intense advocacy, voters were finally given the opportunity to decide whether to pay for a vastly improved transit system. They jumped at the chance — 59 percent agreed to tax themselves to increase bus service and build bus rapid transit lines. The City Council approved the tax earlier this year.
The 0.25 percent income tax will bring in roughly $54 million annually beginning this year. For a city where transit is so scarce, that's enough to implement some transformative changes.
Transit expansion in Indianapolis doesn't look very much like transit expansion in denser cities, where new rail lines are the big-ticket items. Nevertheless, what Indianapolis is doing deserves attention, especially from other spread-out American cities looking to spend their transit dollars as efficiently as possible.
The big change in Indianapolis is a complete reshaping of its bus system. The result, as I'll describe in this installment of Getting Transit Right, will be like setting up a brand-new transit network.
A grid of bus routes to change how people get around the city
Over the past few years, IndyGo (the city's transit agency), the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization, and consultant Jarrett Walker and Associates have developed a plan for the city's new transit funding. The guiding principle is to transform a transit system that aims to cover a broad geographic area into one that's useful for a large number of people and trips.
Instead of operating a bus network that's perceived “as just a social service,” said IndyGo's Brian Luellen, the system redesign aimed to ensure more people had access to better bus service at more times.
The hoped-for result, said Mark Fisher of the Indy Chamber, is that “you no longer have to plan your day around transit.”
The new funding will pay to increase bus service by about 70 percent. The share of Indianapolis low-income households within a half-mile of a bus line that comes at least every 15 minutes will rise from 16 percent to 51 percent; the number of jobs near frequent transit routes will double; and all routes will operate seven days a week.
The most remarkable element of the plan, which is scheduled to be fully implemented by 2019, is the grid of frequent bus service in the city core. The current system relies on bus routes radiating from downtown that don't come very often, much like transit networks in many American cities that prioritize peak-hour service connecting outer neighborhoods to the jobs in a central business district.
This radial structure limits the kind of trips people can make using transit. If you want to get from one neighborhood to another, for instance, you have to wait for a bus that comes infrequently, go downtown, then wait to transfer to another infrequent bus.
In Indianapolis, this is a problem even within downtown, where destinations are far enough away from one another that people can't get where they're going without transferring. The new frequent bus grid will solve these problems in a few ways.
For one, buses will come much more often on several routes, so when people do have to make a connection, they won't have to wait long to catch the next bus. Currently, there are only three corridors where buses come at least every 15 minutes all day. The new bus grid will establish routes with at least 15-minute frequencies on a dozen corridors across the city, improving service to neighborhoods with higher population densities, particularly near downtown.
These network changes will also allow people to travel crosstown along several frequent east-west and north-south corridors. As such, riders will be able to get between neighborhoods much more easily — they won't have to go out of their way and transfer downtown for those trips.
BRT as the spine of the system
Unlike most of the other cities investing in transit, Indianapolis is not proposing any new rail lines. While earlier plans had promoted rail lines crisscrossing downtown, the state legislature voted to prohibit anything other than bus service.
As a result, the transit plan focuses on high-quality, electric bus rapid transit. While the legislative restriction on rail is excessive, it's not harmful — at least not yet — because the city's population and employment densities are too low to support rail. Spending on rail now would mean less money available for bus service that is well-suited for the city's current needs.
The proposed BRT network focuses first on the Red Line. The $98 million first phase of this route would run 13.5 miles north-south, connecting downtown with the Fountain Square and Broad Ripple commercial districts, a major medical center, the University of Indianapolis, and the state fairgrounds. The project is expected to begin construction this year and wrap up in 2019. It's projected to carry 11,000 daily passengers — not bad for a city where total transit ridership currently numbers about 33,000 trips a day. It will be funded mostly by a federal Small Starts grant.
On the Red Line, passengers will pay fares before getting on the bus, speeding up boarding. Special vehicles with doors on both sides will enable stops at the curb or, on sections where buses run in center-aligned transit lanes, stations in the street. Service will be especially frequent.
About 60 percent of the corridor will be getting dedicated bus lanes, an essential element to bypass traffic congestion and ensure reliability. The bus lane design isn't ideal, however.
In some sections along College Avenue north of downtown, the project calls for one-lane, reversible busways. This is a risky compromise, intended to avoid alterations to street parking. It will require buses to wait at stations until the vehicles moving in the opposite direction have passed, which could detract from reliability. On other parts of the line, the bus lane will be shared with turning vehicles, a feature that may also reduce bus speeds.
On the south side of the Red Line, there won't be any dedicated lanes at all. IndyGo suggests that that's because congestion isn't a problem in those areas, but if that's true, what harm is there in dedicating right of way to transit, particularly on the four-lane streets where the buses will run?
The second BRT corridor is the Purple Line, which will share some segments with the Red Line and serve the northeastern part of the city. It could be completed by 2020 if funding aligns as expected. Together, the two lines would be within reach of 90,000 residents and 150,000 jobs, a big portion of the region's population.
Future efforts
Indianapolis has several other plans that are a bit further from realization. The Blue Line along Washington Street would serve one of the region's most transit-dependent populations. Though the line would run on streets with five or more lanes in most places, it would have no dedicated bus lanes. That suggests the Blue Line won't provide service up to the standards of the city's other proposed BRT routes.
Other projects will require support from suburban counties to move forward. IndyGo hopes to extend the Red Line north to Carmel and south to Greenwood, providing access to key suburban destinations. And it plans to invest in a Green Line BRT north from downtown to Fishers and Noblesville, home to significant job concentrations. But those services remain to be funded.
Grading transit expansion in Indianapolis
Indianapolis's transit plans offer big benefits at a low cost. With more bus service and a thoughtful redesign of the network, city residents will be able to take advantage of a much more reliable, frequent transit system. Ridership is certain to increase. While there are weaknesses in the design of new bus lanes, the city is setting a good precedent by dedicated street space to transit on the busiest routes, helping riders bypass car traffic and improving speed and reliability.
Strengths
With relatively little additional money, Indianapolis will dramatically improve the frequency and reliability of its bus network.
The city's new bus network concentrates service in its most densely-populated neighborhoods, greatly increasing the number of people and jobs within reach of good transit service.
The proliferation of frequent bus lines in a grid pattern will enable people to make trips by transit that were inconceivable with the old, infrequent hub-and-spoke system.
A focus on BRT will provide appropriate service for a low-density city at a reasonable cost.
Weaknesses
I recently spoke with someone who told me they had gone on at least 10 interviews in the past three months, and they had not been called back for a single second interview. With their strong work history and many professional accomplishments, it clearly wasn't their experience that was holding them back.
They felt they aren't interviewing well, and they asked if I could give them some ideas that would help them hone their interview skills.
Maybe you find yourself in a similar situation. Even if you don't, everyone can benefit from some new or rediscovered interview techniques and some self-evaluation.
Making a post-interview checklist is a good way to evaluate an interview and find areas for improvement. Here are some things to consider:
The questions you were asked and what your responses were.
If you immediately addressed any interviewer concerns.
The quality of your answers. Were they results-oriented, and did you quantify and qualify those results?
How well you built rapport with the interviewer.
Did you ask open-ended questions?
Are you ready to follow up with a thank-you note? If you asked for a business card, you have the interviewer's contact information.
Were the reporting relationships and expectations of the position clearly outlined? If they weren't, did you ask about them?
You should know what the next steps in the hiring process are. It's fine to ask what they will be before the close of the interview.
This process will help you see where you may be able to improve your interview strategy. Another really helpful technique involves practicing your responses to interview questions. You can practice with a friend, face-to-face, or you can make a video of this process, and review it with someone whose opinion you value.
One final suggestion: Use visualization to improve your interviewing skills. Before the interview, visualize yourself as relaxed and take deep breaths. Begin seeing yourself as answering all the questions with confidence and building a good rapport with your interviewer. Picture yourself smiling and asking for the job.
Calumet City, Illinois, December 17, 2015
A Calumet City resident prevented a gunman from robbing them by pulling out their gun and firing it at the would-be robber, Midlothian police reported. The 68-year-old man, who has a concealed-carry gun permit, told police that a man tried to rob them and their 9-year-old son Dec. 5 in the 3300 block of 147th Street. A witness said they heard people arguing outside, heard four or five gunshots and saw a man running through back yards heading south on Turner Avenue, according to police. . . .
Salt Lake City, Utah, December 15, 2015
They “produced a firearm, pointing it at the EMT first responders,” Jensen wrote. Hunt [an EMT], who has a concealed firearms license, was carrying a gun. “Logan City detectives and State Crime Lab technicians are still piecing together the sequence of events,” Jensen wrote, “but it is believed there was an exchange of gunfire, followed by a rapid retreat of all personnel to positions of cover.” . . .
Houston, Texas, December 14, 2015 (see also here)
. . . It was the end to a night out that a group of people and then men who tried to rob them never expected. “He plugged him, boom, boom, in the chest,” said one of the four victims, who did not want to give their name. The man said he, their brother and two women were about to leave a parking lot near the bars along Washington Avenue and Jackson Hill just after 2 a.m. when two men with handguns walked up to their car. “He said ‘Hey, give me your money,'” recalled the victim. “Well, I don't carry cash, I just have a card. So I put up my card and my ID, and I was like, ‘Hey man this is all I have.'” When the suspect slapped the items out of their hand, the victim says their brother got out of the car and shot the would-be robber twice in the chest. . . .
Evanston, Ohio, December 11, 2015
Cincinnati police said a robbery victim fought back by shooting and killing their 16-year-old assailant late Thursday. Officers responded to Jonathan Avenue near Fernside Place near Walnut Hills High School about 11:30 p.m. after receiving a report of a shooting, said Captain Russ Neville, the night chief. When police arrived, they said they a preliminary investigation determined a teen gunman tried to rob one of two contractors rehabilitating a home when the contractor walked outside to retrieve equipment from a van. The contractor turned over their wallet. The second contractor came to the front door and saw what was occurring, Neville said. The gunman tried to rob them of their wallet, too, but the man – who has told police they have a permit to carry a concealed gun – pulled out their firearm. . . .

TEHRAN, Iran — Iran will ban Americans from entering the country in response to US President Donald Trump's “insulting” order restricting arrivals from Iran and six other Muslim states, the foreign ministry said Saturday.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran… has decided to respond in kind after the insulting decision of the United States concerning Iranian nationals,” the ministry said in a statement carried by state television.
Trump on Friday signed a sweeping executive order to suspend refugee arrivals and impose tough controls on travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Iran's foreign ministry called the decision “illegal, illogical and contrary to international rules.”
It said its own ban on US nationals would continue until the American measure was lifted.
It said it had ordered Iranian diplomatic missions to help Iranians who had been “prevented from returning to their homes and places of work and study” in the United States.
Travel agents in Tehran said that foreign airlines had begun barring Iranians from US-bound flights. Two agencies told AFP they had been instructed by Etihad Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines not to sell US tickets or allow Iranians holding American visas to board US-bound flights.
With more than a million Iranians living in the United States, many families are concerned about the implications of Trump's visa ban.
Newly Leaked NSA Slides On PRISM Add To Confusion, Rather Than Clear It Up
from the hmmm dept
Over the weekend there were two "big" new leaks from the documents that Ed Snowden took. The first, about US spying on EU embassies we already covered . The second one seemed bigger, but it also might have just made things murkier. It involves the Washington Post releasing four more slides about the PRISM program from that original slide deck that already had 5 of its 41 slides revealed in previous leaks. These slides show a lot more details about PRISM. What's amazing is that I've seen people claiming completely contrary things in looking over these slides: some are insisting it shows that the companies who are "members" of PRISM don't -- as was originally reported -- open up their servers to the NSA. Others insist that the slides actually support that original reporting and show that the companies are lying.First up, here are the slides (sorry visitors from the Defense Department ):Things break down when people start to analyze these slides. A few news sources have zeroed in on the claim on that last slide that there are 117,675 "records" in PRISM as of April 5th. But, there's some disagreement about what the hell that means. The Washington Post says that these are "active surveillance targets" but it's unclear how they know that. It's possible that there's other, as yet unrevealed info that would support that, but even then there's confusion. How "active" is active? And, what constitutes a "record" anyway? No one seems to be providing any answers.Another thing that's not entirely clear: the Washington Post annotations claim that the "FBI DITU," the "Data Intercept Technology Unit" (DITU), is on the premises of the companies listed as a part of PRISM -- but all of the companies have pretty strenuously denied this. And, honestly, from the slides, it's not at all clear that the DITU really is on-premises. Google has said in the past that when it receives a valid FISA court order under the associated program, it uses secure FTP to ship the info to the government. From that, it seems like the "DITU" could just be a government computer somewhere, not on the premises of these companies, and info is uploaded to those servers following valid FISC orders.Others have focused in on the claims of "real-time surveillance," implying the ability to watch actual key strokes, but the slide in question (the third one above) suggests something slightly different: which is real timefor certain trigger events, such as logging into email or sending a message. Now, it does note that other forms of communication are available through the program, but it's not at all clear that's "real time." It's also not at all clear if the "real time" notifications apply to all companies in the program. It's entirely possible that a FISC order might require these companies to let the FBI/NSA know whenever a certain target logged into their email or chat. There are certainly some questions raised there about the appropriateness of that type of program, but it's not clear how much "real time" info is actually being sent.It's entirely possible that the Washington Post's interpretation of these slides is accurate. It's also entirely possible that the other slides, or additional reporting from WaPo reporters allows them to have more knowledge on these things, and it could be true that the companies in questions are not being fully truthful. However, especially given how it appears that the WaPo's original reporting on PRISM was fairly sloppy, it seems worth reserving judgment until more information comes out.Of course, if (as the NSA insists) this program is nothing more than these companies responding to valid FISC orders, I don't see why the NSA itself can't be a hell of a lot more transparent about these programs. If there'sover these programs and they're really only used against actual threats (stop laughing...), then nothing revealed so far seems like it should be secret. It just shows how the system works for delivering the information that is legally required. The fact that there's so much secrecy over the program suggests either a stupid overclassification insistence by the NSA, or that there's a hell of a lot beyond this that they don't want to talk about (such as revealing that the programwhat they claim). That seems like the most likely situation given what's been revealed so far.

Hi all,I'm glad to announce that we've just released(build number 9.0.2006).Here is the list of major changes/improvements:•New DeepScreen technology allows avast! to make more intelligent decisions about new/unknown files. DeepScreen is a successor of AutoSandbox, now upgraded with some additional new technologies such as dynamic binary translation and dyna-gen announced earlier.•New Hardened mode for stricter lockdown scenarios. This is a new mode that is recommended especially for novice users (such as your grandmas): it automatically blocks execution of binaries that would normally be deepscreened (Moderate level) or even allows only execution of programs that are well-known to FileRep (Aggressive level). In a way, it brings the whitelisting concept to the consumer AV space.•Improved cloud scanning features and crowdsourced analysis of suspicious items. This includes new, optimized mechanism for collecting data from our sensors.•Continuously streaming update (CSU) technology for up-to-minute detections. This is not entirely new for v2014, but we now have really buttoned up the whole streaming update infrastructure to allow for reliable, uninterrupted service. We're currently doing 350-400 updates a day, which equals to one update in roughly every 3.75 minutes, 24x7, 365 days a year. Streaming updates can now also carry more types of definitions than before.•Improved cleaning of malware. This applies to standard malware as well as rootkits and file infectors.•All-new web browser plugins featuring comprehensive security ratings, protection against malware, phishing and typosquatting sites and Do-Not-Track (DNT) functionality for improved anonymity on the Internet. The DNT functionality doesn't rely on the DNT HTTP headers; instead, it uses a proprietary technology that cannot be overridden by the servers.•All-new SafeZone for more secure online shopping and banking. Users can now switch back and forth between SafeZone and the regular browser with a single click. Also, online banking sites can be automatically opened in the SafeZone.•Rescue disk - allow users to create a bootable CD or flash disk with Avast on it. Great for cleaning.•A new, streamlined user interface for simplified navigation and more user comfort. The new UI is actually much simplified, and it's probably the biggest change since version 5.0. We have also redefined the shields to the total number of three (File Shield, Web Shield, Mail Shield) and tweaked the action buttons (tiles) on the home page so that they're now fully configurable.•Control and manage all protected devices directly from the Avast console. That is, the my.avast.com account is perfectly integrated in the UI to allow for management of all your devices running Avast.•Dramatic reduction in product size (full installer < 60MB, compared to today's 120MB) and memory footprint. By default, install is done through a new stub installer though (which has the advantage of always installing the most up-to-date version).•Faster scanning thanks to optimized scanning engine (raw [in-memory] scans of EXE files are about 2x faster, while scans of text contents (e.g. web pages and scripts) are up to 10x faster).•Completely rewritten setup/updater that makes the installation and upgrade process faster, easier and more reliable•Firewall has been redesigned from scratch to allow for better compatibility with the latest Windows, better performance and full support for IPv6 (although its UI hasn't really changed).•New licensing system allows for much easier management of product licenses. The system relies on activation codes, and these can be added seamlessly by simply clicking a link.•Various improvement in the Software Updater and Browser Cleanup tool.Download locationsavast! cleaner:It should be possible to install this version on top of your existing avast! installation (all settings should be preserved). Or you can use in-product updater.thanks a lot, enjoy this release!!!Pavel

Donald Trump's election revealed not only the depths of our political polarization, but also the public's dwindling trust in media and the impact of economic anxiety on voters. In the wake of Trump's inauguration, America's most widely-heard business and financial news program is seeking to examine the disconnect between improving top-line numbers for the US economy and the feeling among many Americans that they are barely treading water.
Marketplace, the 28-year-old suite of programs from American Public Media that is now broadcast on nearly 800 public radio stations around the country, is expanding its offerings. The program has set itself a lofty goal: Increase Americans' economic literacy.
Its first effort, Make Me Smart, a podcast featuring longtime Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal and tech reporter Molly Wood, launches today. Ryssdal and Wood know that to achieve their goal, they need to find ways to grow their audience beyond Marketplace's 13 million weekly listeners. They hope the podcast, aimed at deep exploration of economic issues and including participation from audience members and experts, will begin to do that.
During the campaign, Trump often cast doubt on official economic numbers, so much so that their press secretary, Sean Spicer, was asked on Monday what the unemployment rate was in a question driving at whether the administration would be accepting Bureau of Labor statistics. Spicer refused to answer, saying that there were “several versions” of the number. Just before the election, a Marketplace survey found that one quarter of Americans–including nearly half of Trump supporters, but just five percent of Clinton supporters–completely distrust federal economic data such as the unemployment rate, number of jobs added, and the amount of consumer spending.
“That to me is deeply, deeply troubling,” Ryssdal says. “It talks about what [Trump] did during the campaign. It talks about the deep cynicism that is out there among a portion of the electorate. It talks about the challenges that we as economic journalists have about presenting the facts of an economy. It's all of a piece, because it's not just journalists who have to be believed; it's facts that have to be believed.”
Many news organizations are pondering how to rebuild trust with a skeptical public. Make Me Smart aims to be an “ongoing conversation” with the audience, and its hosts believe the more conversational format and deeper exploration of the economy from topline numbers to on-the-ground reality with help engage new listeners.

Wood says that, since the election, they have been focused on a simple question: “Do people trust us? When we come to the point where we need to say, ‘These numbers are real' or ‘This story is true,' do we have that trust?” Recognizing that, far more often than would be desirable, the answer is “no,” they see engagement with the audience as one way to break through. “It's a great moment to come out with a product where we talk directly to our listeners every single week.”
Make Me Smart won't try to produce a full report on the week's economic news. Instead, it intends to tackle a single issue such as housing foreclosures. “What we get to do on this show is take one [topic] and explore it all the way, with an audience having their voices be part of the show constantly, and be more transparent about our learning process as our audience informs us about a topic,” Wood says. “We're trying to spend our time connecting those dots.”
Marketplace is planning to explore additional audio options, and it will also seek to build partnerships with other outlets. Over the past eight months, Marketplace has worked with Frontline and PBS NewsHour on a jointly published production called “How the Deck is Stacked” that explores the dissonance between the improved economy and issues like wage stagnation and income inequality.
Though plans to expand Marketplace were in the works long before November, Make Me Smart's hosts acknowledge that the election has sharpened their purpose. “Political change in this country was driven, at least in part, by the way things are going in this economy,” Ryssdal says. “With the renewed mission that we have of increasing the economic literacy and intelligence of the American population, this is the time for us to embrace that more than we have in the past. There is a situation now where the economy is going to be changing, and we want to help people understand what is going on.”
