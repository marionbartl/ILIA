Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told Politico today there is no evidence Trump Tower was wiretapped.
President Trump accused Deep State of wiretapping Trump Tower last weekend.
You just gotta love these Republican Congressional leaders!
There's also no evidence Russia hacked the election but he's never spoken out against that!
The Washington Examiner reported:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday there's “no evidence” to back up President Trump's claims that any U.S. government intelligence agency wiretapped Trump Tower during last year's campaign.
“There's no evidence of that – I've not heard that before,” the Kentucky Republican said during a Politico Playbook Thursday morning interview.
However, McConnell also said Trump's claim, which the Obama administration has furiously denied, is an “appropriate subject” for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate.
Trump nominated for Mad Magazine's Person of the Year Award After being shunned by Time magazine as its 2017 “Person of the Year,” Donald “Trumporleone” Trump has apparently lucked out. An unreliable source indicated that the editorial board of Mad Magazine offered to name The Don as its 2017 “Person of the Year.” In response, it was reported that The Don said: “Mad Magazine called to say that I was going to be named 'Person of the Year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot."
"I said I'm all in and available for an interview and photo shoot at your convenience.”
“Thanks a lot guys!” This highly coveted annual award is presented by the board to the Person that is deemed to exemplify maddening character traits such as: Extreme Narcissism
Serial Lying
Dictatorial aspirations

Ontario's New Democrats want to cap the salaries of CEOs at hospitals, electrical utilities and all public sector agencies at $418,000, twice the premier's annual salary.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath says taxpayers are not being respected when Ontario Power Generation CEO Tom Mitchell is paid $1.7 million a year while homeowners pay some of the highest electricity rates in Canada.
And she says nurses are being laid off while hospital CEOs pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
Horwath says her bill to put a ceiling on compensation for public sector bosses mirrors similar laws in France and the United States, where President Barack Obama put a $400,000 cap on executives whose companies receive public money.
Her private member's bill would allow for some exemptions on a case-by-case basis for executives with very specific skill sets, such as nuclear engineers.
Government Services Minister John Milloy says the Liberals have agreed to consider hard caps on some public sector salaries, and promises to "implement new measures in the coming months."
Milloy points out the government already froze salaries for executives at hospitals, universities, colleges, school boards and provincially owned electricity companies as part of its deficit-fighting efforts.
The salary caps have been among Horwath's priorities for a few years. She put forward a similar bill in 2010 and has repeatedly pressured the Liberals to support the effort, in exchange for the NDP's co-operation on provincial budgets.
The number of public-sector workers who earn more than $100,000 — listed annually in the province's so-called "sunshine list" — has recently been growing between 10 and 11 per cent per year.
The release of the most recent list saw the Progressive Conservatives' finance critic at the time, Peter Shurman, echo Horwath's call for a wage freeze.
After the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight on Christmas day, a months-old question for the Senate became a pressing concern for the public: Why is the Transportation Security Administration without an appointed director?
While President Obama did make a nomination to the spot — one Erroll Southers, a counterterrorism expert and former FBI special agent — Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC) has held up his appointment for months. His blockade of Southers' nomination is apparently due to President Obama's promise that he would push to allow TSA baggage screeners full union rights.
The objection being, if baggage screeners are allowed to negotiate for better pay, benefits and working conditions, it would somehow place national security at risk.
“DeMint's objection creates a procedural hurdle that will probably take at least three days of debate and test votes to overcome,” The Washington Post reported.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has vowed to fast-track the nomination once the Senate returns to session in late January.
Supporters of allowing union rights at the TSA “point out that other workers deemed responsible for public safety—like police and firemen—are heavily unionized,” U.S. News and World Report noted in 2008. “And many other federal employees, including those who deal with national security like border patrol agents and customs officers, have the right to collectively bargain.”
Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, DeMint defended his objection to the nomination, repeatedly insisting “there's a reason” why the TSA is not allowed to unionize, but never really outlining what that reason is.
At one point, he even appeared to blame illegal immigration on labor unions.
“I think the American people should be aware that the priority of the administration is to submit our airport security to collective bargaining with the unions, even though that's been prohibited since the agency was formed,” DeMint explained.
The reason it was prohibited, he said, is because the agency has “a constant need to adjust and to be flexible, to use imagination and to change things.”
“We cannot ask a third party union boss whether we can move a screener from one station to another,” DeMint added.
The American Federation of Government Employees disagrees with the senator.
“This is not an issue of security,” a group spokeswoman said, according to CNN. “There is no evidence that labor union rights have any effect on transportation security officers. This is a dedicated workforce who see their jobs as important to the security of the nation.”
“They point to union members who acted after 9/11 and the Fort Hood massacre as well,” the host said. “These were union members — firefighters, police officers — who essentially acted very quickly, and that your argument doesn't hold water here.”
“The union boss that you were interviewing used the customs and border enforcement as an example,” DeMint said, though customs and border enforcement had not been mentioned during the segment. “We do have 12 million undocumented aliens in our country and that agency has also had to deal with all kinds of charges for changing prices for parking. They're dealing with the collective bargaining of unions all the time and they're not as effective as they should be.”
“John Gage, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told CNN earlier this month, ‘People who insinuate that being a union member has a nation security implication are just totally wrong,'” Pro Publica noted.

When Pope Francis visited the Holy Land last May, one member of his entourage stood out: Lebanese Cardinal Bechara Rai, the patriarch of Maronite Christians.
Lebanese citizens are banned from visiting Israel because the two countries are technically at war, but clergy of the Maronite church are exempt. Still, Rai is the first Lebanese cardinal to visit Israel.
The message Rai brought was for Israeli members of the Maronite church to stay connected to each other, and to fellow Christians around the world.
Maronites are a Christian community that traces its roots to southern Lebanon. No more than 10,000 Maronites live in Israel, a tiny fraction of an already small Christian community.
A local Maronite bishop introduced Cardinal Rai to a crowd of several hundred, but he needed no introduction. He is, after all, the religious equivalent of a rock star.
“There is no church that didn't suffer before, and we are also here suffering,” he said. “We are not different from other Christians suffering in other places.”
The cardinal spoke at the entrance of an old stone church, one of the only remaining buildings from the Maronite village of Kfar Biram in northern Israel. During its 1948 war for independence, Israel asked residents to leave for two weeks — and never let them come back. Former residents and their descendants have been trying to return ever since.
In recent months, a few hundred activists have pitched tents on the site of the village's ruins, raising chickens to show they can revive the village. Cardinal Rai said he would ask the Vatican to encourage Israel to allow Kfar Biram to be rebuilt.
Rai's visit felt like a party. Teenage boys tossed sandwiches to the audience; older volunteers gave out white baseball caps printed with the cardinal's picture. Massive posters welcomed the cardinal to the village, an honor Kfar Biram has not had in several centuries.
But the cardinal's festive visit underscored a tough question: where do Maronite Christians fit in today's Israel? Shadi Khaloul helped make sure the event went smoothly.
“We see Syria, in Iraq, in Egypt, we see there is no future for Christians in these Arab Islamic countries,” Khaloul said. “So I prefer to live with my Jewish brothers and defend this country.”
Khaloul served in an elite unit of the Israeli army. He's now part of a group encouraging Christian Israelis to enlist. He says Maronites can serve because they're not Arab, or Palestinians — they're descendants of Arameans, a group that originated in modern day Syria a few thousand years before Christ. Khaloul is also trying to revive the Aramean language, Aramaic, which was spoken by Jesus but has been nearly forgotten in the past few centuries.
“The Maronites have [an] identity, and their national ID is Aramaic Phoenician. And we would love to keep it and preserve it and not to get involved with the Arab-Israeli conflict,” Khaloul said.
But the wider Maronite community, which generally identifies as Israeli-Arab, isn't so sure. Attorney Michel Aoun, whose parents fled the village of Biram, said Khaloul is stuck in the past.
“This is ridiculous,” Aoun said. “You are what you are, today; you are what your father was maybe 50 years ago. But you can't be something that your ancestors 3,000 [or] 4,000 years ago became. Historical facts are that the Christians living in Biram are original Palestinians, okay?”
Tenth grader Aseel Lukkah also didn't care much for her supposed Aramean roots. I ask if she speaks Aramaic and she chuckles. Her answer catches the ear of a man standing nearby.
“It's a dead language. I don't care about it anymore,” Lukkah said. The man next to her protested. “It's not a dead language! It's a living language. It's the language of Jesus, we use it in church, school kids are learning the language.”
This division over the responsibility of Maronites to remember their past and their loyalty to Israel is at an all-time high right now.
Amal Jamal is a political science professor at Tel Aviv University. He says the rise of Islamic fundamentalist groups, like ISIS, is forcing Maronites to make a choice: Do they stay with their fellow Arabic-speaking Palestinians, or do they join with a stable country like Israel?
“There are very deep rifts and differences and a very strong debate within the community itself concerning what would be the best future,” Jamal said. “You have those who still want to keep and maintain their Arab identity and their affiliation with Palestinian people, and you have those [who] prefer to view their future with Israeli society, hoping Israel can provide them with more safety and stability for the future.”
The stakes are high. Maronites supported the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, but have since suffered attacks by both the government and by Islamist rebels. Most of Iraq's Christians — including a sizeable Maronite community — left over the last decade and thousands more are leaving in the current turmoil.
After Rai finished talking, Maronite believers lined up outside the church and filed in to shake the cardinal's hand. Rai looked parishioners in the eye, shook their hands and touched their faces. He came to help the community stay connected — but that sense of togetherness is getting harder to maintain.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The California Supreme Court granted a law license Thursday to a man who has been living in the U.S. illegally for two decades, a ruling that advocates hope will open the door to immigrants seeking to enter other professions such as medicine, nursing and accounting.
The unanimous decision means Sergio Garcia, who attended law school and passed the state bar exam while working in a grocery store and on farms, can begin practicing law immediately.
The decision is the latest in a string of legal and legislative victories for people who are living in the country without permission. Other successes include the creation of a path to citizenship for many young people and the granting of drivers licenses in many states.
"This is a bright new day in California history and bodes well for the future," the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles said in a statement.
The court sided with state officials in the case, which pitted them against the White House over a 1996 federal law that bars people who are in the U.S. illegally from receiving professional licenses from government agencies or with the use of public funds, unless state lawmakers vote otherwise.
Bill Hing, a law professor at University of San Francisco, said the court made clear the only reason it granted Garcia's petition is that California recently approved a law authorizing the state to give law licenses to immigrants living in the country illegally, a measure inspired by Garcia's situation. The new law took effect Wednesday.
It was unclear how many people will qualify to practice law under the ruling and whether it will spread to other states. Legislatures and governors in more conservative states such as Alabama and Arizona are likely to be less receptive to the idea.
Garcia, who plans to be a personal injury attorney in his hometown of Chico, said he hoped the ruling would serve as a "beacon of hope" to others in the same situation.
He "can hang up a shingle and be his own company," said Hing, who represented the state bar in the case. "Once he does that, a client can retain him as a lawyer."
But some questions remain unresolved, such as whether Garcia can argue cases in federal court or in other states. Federal law makes it illegal for law firms to hire him.
Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, who wrote the opinion, said the new state law removed any barrier to Garcia's quest for a license.
"And there is no other federal statute that purports to preclude a state from granting a license to practice law to an undocumented immigrant," Cantil-Sakauye wrote.
The court also found that Garcia "possesses the requisite good moral character" to be admitted to the state bar.
Garcia arrived in the U.S. as a teenager to pick almonds with his father, who was a permanent legal resident. His father filed a petition in 1994 seeking an immigration visa for his son. It was accepted in 1995, but because of the backlog of visa applications from people from Mexico, Garcia has never received a visa number.
He applied for citizenship in 1994 and is still working toward that goal.
The U.S. Department of Justice argued that Garcia was barred from receiving his law license because the court's entire budget comes from the public treasury, a violation of the federal mandate that no public money be used to grant licenses to people who are in the country without permission.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Tenney, who argued the case, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
The Obama administration's position in the case came as a surprise to some, since the White House has shielded from deportation people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, graduated from high school and kept a clean criminal record.
At a hearing in September, a majority of the state Supreme Court justices appeared reluctant to grant Garcia the license under current state and federal law, saying it prohibited them from doing so unless the Legislature acted.
Garcia, 36, worked in the fields and at a grocery store before attending community college. He then became a paralegal, went to law school and passed the bar on his first try. His effort to get licensed was supported by state bar officials and California's attorney general, who argued that citizenship is not a requirement to receive a California law license.
The weakest link in any security system is always the human in the loop. More computer networks are compromised because of laziness, incompetence, and just rank stupidity by humans than by all the high tech hackers in the world.
If you recall the genesis of the hacking of John Podesta's email had two parts. First, Podesta received a spear-phishing email made to look like it was from Google that told him someone had tried to access his email and that he should immediately change it. It gave him a helpful link. Podesta was suspicious and asked Hillary Clinton's crack IT team what to do. They told him the email was legit and to do what it said. Podesta complied and we know how it happened because his Help Desk request was among his leaked emails. No wizardry of computer code was involved, they simply asked Podesta for his password and got it.
Over the past few days, numerous members of the Trump administration have been sucked into email exchanges with an internet troll who goes by the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN. Nothing high tech was involved. @SINON_REBORN created a mail.com address using the name of other administration members and went to work.
“Reince Priebus” trolls Anthony Scaramucci:
On Friday, Scaramucci posted this tweet:
Family does not need to be drawn into this. Soon we will learn who in the media has class and who doesn't. No further comments on this. — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 29, 2017
“Reince Priebus” wasn't amused:
Scaramucci fired back:
Scaramucci, apparently unaware the email was a hoax, responded with indignation. “You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize,” Scaramucci wrote. The prankster, now aware that he had deceived the beleaguered Scaramucci, went in for the kill. “I can't believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called ‘Mooch', who can't even manage his first week in the White House without leaving upset in his wake,” the fake Priebus wrote. “I have nothing to apologize for.” Scaramucci shot back with a veiled threat to destroy Priebus Shakespearean-style. “Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me,” the actual Scaramucci.
Reince (me) giving @Scaramucci something to think about. He never replied haha pic.twitter.com/hutjACmogR — EMAIL PRANKSTER™ (@SINON_REBORN) August 1, 2017
“Jon Huntsman” trolls Anthony Scaramucci:
An excerpt of what I emailed to @Scaramucci whilst playing the part of Jon Huntsman Jr. Apparently this didn't seem out of the ordinary?! ?? pic.twitter.com/6INHJi3KCD — EMAIL PRANKSTER™ (@SINON_REBORN) August 1, 2017
As is noted, what is significant here is that Scaramucci apparently didn't disagree with the description of Trump's sons.
“Eric Trump” trolls Jon Huntsman:
Huntsman himself was also tricked, with the prankster pretending to be Eric Trump, the President's son. “Thanks for the thoughtful note,” the ambassador-designate wrote to fake Eric Trump. “Russia will be a challenging but no doubt rewarding assignment.” The fake Eric Trump responded with this suggestion: “Maybe we could have Dad sat (sic) on a horse, top off, giving the full Putin! He's in better shape than his suits suggest.”
“Donald Trump, Jr.” trolls Eric Trump:
Eric Trump, too, was similarly hoodwinked by the prankster emailing as his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., but he soon caught on and responded, “I have sent this to law enforcement who will handle from here.”
Fun and games, so far, but the danger of this was soon made obvious. “Jared Kushner” invited Trump's Homeland Security adviser to a party:
In one episode, CNN reported, the prankster posed as Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and wrote to Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert, who revealed his personal email address unsolicited. Bossert works on cybersecurity issues, but still fell for the prank. “Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soirée towards the end of August,” the prankster posing as Kushner wrote to Bossert's official White House email account. “It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening.” Bossert wrote back: “Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can't refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is” (redacted).
One can only imagine the havoc that would have been wrought had a hacker intent upon breaching the White House email system been at work rather than someone amusing his Twitter followers.
I am not sure how many of you like the default usplash screen of Ubuntu, but I am definitely one of those that dislike it and find it dull and boring. I prefer to have some images that are beautiful and able to make my first impression (when turning on the computer) a pleasant one. First impression does count, isn't it?
Splashy is a splash screen application that can be used by anyone to create and configure their own usplash screen on a Linux (and FreeBSD) machine.
In this tutorial, I will go through the steps for you to create and install your own splash theme with splashy (and gsplashy).
Removing the usplash
In Ubuntu, the splash screen is governed by the usplash. To make sure that it does not conflict with splashy, we will need to remove usplash and install splashy as its replacement.
In your terminal (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal), type the following:
sudo apt-get autoremove usplash
Installing splashy and gsplashy
Download the splashy packages here:
32-bit machine – libsplashy1_0.3.10-1_i386.deb, splashy_0.3.10-1_i386.deb
64-bit machine – libsplashy1_0.3.13-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb, libsplashy1-dev_0.3.13-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb, splashy_0.3.13-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb
Double-click the packages to install.
In the terminal, type the following command to install the splashy-themes:
sudo apt-get install splashy-themes
Still in the terminal, type the following to open the apt file
gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
Add the following line to the end of the file. Save and close the file.
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian unstable main
Back to the terminal,
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install splashy splashy-themes
You will receive a message that the package is unverified. Type Y (Yes) to continue.
(The following instruction for installing splashy should work for 64-bit machine too, but in the event that it fails, download and install the 64-bit deb package – splashy_0.3.13-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb, libsplashy1-dev_0.3.13-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb, libsplashy1_0.3.13-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb.)
Install gsplashy
Gsplashy is the graphical manager for splashy that allows you to create/install splashy theme easily.
Download gsplashy to your Desktop. Extract the folder to your Desktop.
Install the dependencies
sudo apt-get install libglade2-dev libsplashy1-dev build-essential
cd to the gsplashy folder and compile the code
cd ~/Desktop/gsplashy0.1 (change the path if you have extracted gsplashy in another location)
./configure
make
make install
Creating a launcher in the menu
Right-click on the menu bar and select Edit Menus.
On the left pane, select Accessories (or any other place that you want to place the gsplashy entry).
On the right, click New Item. Enter the following information:
Click OK to close.
Creating your own usplash theme
Open gsplashy (Applications –> Accessories –> gsplashy)
Click on the Create a theme button. The first thing that you will see is the Info tab. This is where you enter the information for your theme.
On the Background tab, this is where you specify your own images for the usplash screen. There are several options that you have display images on: during boot up, during shutdown, when there is error, on system resume (from hibernation) or when you suspend the computer. You can choose to use different images or the same image for all the options.
One thing to note is that it is preferable to set your images to the 1024 x 768 dimension.
The FX option is some effects that you can for your image to appear. If there is any error and you want it to display on screen, check the box Verbose on error.
On the Progress bar tab, this is where you customize the location and interface of the progress bar.
Put a check beside any of the 4 boxes (boot, shutdown, resume, suspend) to show the progress bar when those screens are loaded. The Forward/Backward option determines the direction the progress bar is moving. The conventional way is to show Forward during boot and Backward during shutdown, but you are free to change it to your liking.
The X and Y fields refer to the location of the progress bar, measured from the top left corner of the screen. The Width and Height fields are where you define the width and height of the progress bar. There are also options for you to select the foreground and background color of the progress bar and whether there is a border or not.
On the Text box, this is the place to customize the textbox in the usplash screen. It is turned off by default since most people don't like to have a textbox to cover up their beautiful images. If you like to have a textbox, click Enable and set the necessary configuration.
Once you are done with your configuration, click Apply. gsplashy will automatically generate the theme.
Back to the main screen, you should now find your custom made theme in the display. Select it to make it the default theme for splashy. You will be prompted to update-initramfs. Close the gsplashy.
Back to your terminal, run the following command:
sudo update-initramfs –u
That's it. You have just successfully created and installed the usplash screen for your Ubuntu.
To get it to run, you need to add an additional entry in the grub file.
In your terminal,
gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
Scroll down to look for the line
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-7-generic root=UUID=82ace599-c240-456a-8df9-96b0b477d00b ro single
Append ‘vga=792' (without the quote) to the end of the line. Save and close the file.
Restart your computer. You should see the your beautiful usplash theme in action now.
“We've got to pick it up offensively,” Manager Terry Collins said. “We've got to do a better job of using the field to hit. And we've done it. We certainly have done it. We've got to do it again.”
DeGrom, who won two games in the Mets' division series against the Los Angeles Dodgers and one in the National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, took his first postseason loss. This time, facing a relentless lineup that is undeterred by even the most accomplished pitchers in baseball, deGrom gave up four runs and six hits, walked three and struck out two.
He was unhittable for three innings, but then things began to unravel in the fifth, when the Royals scored four times. DeGrom, known for his ability to collect strikeouts, was not missing the Royals' bats with his pitches. He induced only three swings and misses, and he labored more than usual with too many balls crossing the hitting zone.
“I told Jake not everything has to be a strike,” Collins said. “You've got to move it around. You've got to change speeds, give them something to look at. If you continue to pound the strike zone, they're going to put it in play, and that's what they did.”
Cueto, on the other hand, pitched the game of his life, allowing only two hits while striking out four and walking three in a magnificent effort.
Even though the White House decision to officially give weapons to the YPG is a decision made a bit late, it has become the demonstration of confidence in our forces fighting against Daesh and all the terrorist gang groups. Many victories have been achieved in the fight against terror over the past 5 years and in the ongoing war, both with the struggle of our forces with their own means and with the support of the International Coalition forces. YPG proved to the whole world, especially to the International Coalition forces, that it is the main force fighting against terrorism. Before this decision of the United States, our forces have had deficiencies for a long time.
With this decision of the United States, all unreal claims against our forces have been completely wasted.
We believe that this historical decision will further strengthen the struggle of our forces against terrorism. Because this decision will bring rapid and important results for the democratic forces fighting against terrorism.
Our forces welcome this historic decision and declare that we will build a Syria where all peoples will live together freely, defeating the dark powers with the support of International Coalition forces.
YPG Spokesman Rêdûr Xelîl | May 10, 2017
I haven't written anything about the murders in Charleston, mostly because I haven't had time. I expect to talk about the murders tomorrow on the Laura Ingraham show, where I will be guest hosting. I would encourage you to tune in for that. In the meantime, one obvious point can be made: Barack Obama has disgraced himself, once again, by trying to make political hay out of the murders:
“I have had to make statement like this too many times. Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times,” Obama said. “We don't have all the facts. But we do know that once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.”
Murder is a terrible thing, but thankfully, the homicide rate in the United States is dropping. It was lower in 2014 than in 2013, and lower in 2013 than in 2012. Today, it is only about half what it was during the Clinton administration. In the intervening years, private handgun ownership has exploded. Many argue, and statistics support the claim, that broader gun ownership has contributed to this stunning reduction in the homicide rate.
In this particular case, an uncle of the murderer, Dylann Roof, has said that he got the gun–a .45 handgun, apparently–from his father as a birthday present. Is Obama proposing legislation that would make it illegal for a family member to give another family member a firearm? If so, that proposal would be brand new. The Democrats have never had such a law on their wish list.
The facts as reported are sketchy and may prove to be entirely wrong, but if the father bought the gun to give to Dylann as a present, I think it would be an illegal straw purchase. On the other hand, if the father had owned the gun for a while, it would be legal to give it to his son. So if Obama is proposing legislation, what is it, and how does it differ from existing law?
“Let's be clear. At some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,” Obama said. “It doesn't happen in other places with this type of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it . . . At some point, it's going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it and for us to be able to shift how we think about gun violence collectively,” he said.
Charlie Hebdo, as some wag noted, was unavailable for comment. “Mass violence” happens in lots of countries; more important, the homicide rate in the U.S. is about average, ranking higher than some western countries that have less demographic diversity, but much lower than Russia, most of Africa, the Caribbean, and most of Latin America. The assertion that we have a unique problem with “gun violence” is simply false.
Obama does not specify, naturally, how we should “shift how we think about gun violence collectively.” He is just trying to fire up his base, not to achieve anything constructive. But here is an idea: news reports indicate that South Carolina law prohibits carrying concealed firearms in churches. The one thing that undoubtedly could have stopped the deranged and reportedly drug-addled Dylann Roof is a couple of parishioners with guns. Somehow, though, I don't suppose that is the “shift” that Obama had in mind.
To answer your first question, concerning the grammar: spoken French is syntactically different from written French. So much so that some linguists contend they are two different languages! I think that's a bit much, since there is mutual intelligibility. But you could easily hold that they are two different dialects. In that respect, the difference between written and spoken French is much larger than that between written and spoken (standard) English, which is stylistically different in writing from its spoken form, but only slightly so.
Here are a few examples of how different spoken French is from written French.
Past tense: Written French still employs the synthetic simple past form (le passé simple)... which hasn't been routinely used in speech for some 200 years. In speech, everyone uses the periphrastic passé composé, which superficially resembles the English perfect.
(1) English : Mom brought cake.
Written French: Maman apporta du gateau
Spoken French: Maman a apporté du gateau [lit.: M has brought cake]
It wasn't until relatively recently that the spoken past form was even acceptable in prose. In fact, readers of Camus's L'étranger got their first shock not when Meursault murdered that Arab, but when they read the opening sentence "Today, Mom died" in the passé composé (Aujourd'hui, Maman est morte ) instead of Aujourd'hui, Maman mourut.
Written French also still uses past subjunctive forms that dropped out of speech even before the passé simple did. Spoken French just uses the `present' subjunctive forms for both.
(2) English: I wanted to you to speak to him
WF: Je voulais que tu lui parlasses
SF: Je voulais que tu lui parles
Questions: Expressing questions in written French involves a complicated process resembling the English one (minus inserted auxiliaries). Wh-words (what, who, etc) are moved to the front.
In spoken French, nothing moves, and the only sign of a question is the intonation. (Linguists: wh- is in situ).
(3) English: What have you done?
WF: Qu'as-tu fait?
SF : Tu as fait quoi? (contracted to T'as fait quoi?)
[Lit: you have done what?]
In France, the written question form is virtually never used outside of fixed expressions. In Belgium and Canada it's still more common, but the spoken form is still heard more often. However, the written form persists in writing so strongly that even advertisements are usually written with it, even if they insert English words for hipness. I recall one political TV show where people would text in questions that the producers displayed on the screen... inevitably in written question form Sarkozy fera-t-il baisser le prix d'essence?. The hosts would read the question aloud in its written form, but if the question was ever repeated it was always in spoken form: Il f'ra baisser le prix d'essence, Sarko?
Which brings me to perhaps the biggest difference:
Discourse configuration: Written French word order is based on argument structure, i.e. the role the nouns play in the verb's action: Subject verb object. In spoken French, however, word order is much more dependent on discourse structure--- the role the nouns play in the speech context.
In English we can move things around for this kind of reason, but it isn't common. For instance, to show contrast, we can put objects before subjects:
(4) Coffee, I like. Tea, I don't.
This displacement is accompanied by a sharp change in intonation--- the contrasted item gets emphasized.
We can also set nouns apart as topics (this is called topicalization)
(5) Your brother, he can run a mile in five minutes!
Again, in English this isn't common. And in written French, it isn't common either. But in spoken French, it's the normal way to make a sentence.
(4 again) Le café, j'adore. Le thé, moins
(5 again) Ton frère, il peut courir un km six en cinq minutes!
In spoken French, it's also common to put several nouns in front. Note that with topicalization (5) you have to have a pronoun in the sentence that refers to any arguments that you've topicalized. One sentence that I remember well:
(6) Moi, les flics, je les aime pas.
I don't like cops [Lit: Me, cops, I don't like 'em]
The use of nous, on for "we" is common, too, if you're interested in syntax-semantic mismatches (on is 3rd singular morphologically)
(7) Nous, on va au ciné ce soir.
We're going to the movies tonight [Lit: Us, one is going to the movies tonight]
It's also normal to put things after the sentence. This is usually done to emphasize the last constituent, notably the predicate. The emphasized part is pronounced with more loudness and higher pitch.
(8) Il est con , ton frère.
Your brother's a jerk. [Lit: He's a jerk, your brother ]
The next one was some advice from my mother-in-law
(9) Faut en boire , du café, le matin.
You have to drink coffee in the mornings
[Lit: have-to some drink, coffee, the morning ]
Here's one to compare to (7):
(10) On va au ciné , nous.
We're going to the movies [ Lit: one goes to the movies, us ]
This use is so common that when you don't put any of the nouns to the right, you can just add quoi (what). Quoi can also signal impatience (the way we use already).
(11) On va au ciné , quoi.
We're going to the movies [ Lit: one goes to the movies, what ]
(12) Il est con , quoi!
What a freakin' jerk! [Lit: He's a jerk, what]
(13) Tu viens quand , toi?
So when are you finally coming? [ Lit: You come when, you]
I could go on--- there are other uses along similar lines. But you see the point. Spoken French is... different from written French.
Other differences:
The use of on for 1st person plural instead of nous,
The dropping of ne for negation (pas, plus, guère, que, etc.).
The insertion of question particle ti (in some parts of France) or tu (in Quebec)
In France at least, these changes occur virtually 100% of the time outside of formal speech, even among the educated. A lot of times, people don't even write commas in the discourse configuration cases. And for some (like the past tense) they don't occur in anyone's speech. [It's a fun game you can try with French speakers to use passé simple in a sentence and see how they react.] I can't speak for Belgium or Canada, but reports are that the forms used in writing are a bit more common in speech, but still not all that common.
These differences are one reason why students of French have a hard time arriving in France--- if we're taught to read French, we learn a different grammar from the one we're hearing! And that's before you add slang, colloquialisms, and dialectal differences.
But to answer the question of why there is so vast a difference... je sais pas, moi. I suppose that in the educated circles where written French flourished, the stylistic standards remained so strict that they kept spoken French from interloping. If that process lasts long enough, maybe a few hundred years, we can see results like what we see in French. I mean, it took hundreds of years after the sound change before the change of spelling in the imparfait from -ois to -ais became widely accepted.
The Durham District School Board has ruled that students don't have to read To Kill A Mockingbird if they don't want to. It's all part of a modern curriculum change that would give students (or most likely parents) more control over the novels studied in class.
To be very clear: the book is not being banned — students are just no longer required to read it. The idea is that those who feel uncomfortable about the language and the themes of To Kill A Mockingbird will be allowed to choose another option to read in class.
Written by Harper Lee and published in 1961, To Kill A Mockingbird follows the story of Atticus Finch, a lawyer who defends a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. It's a classic novel that explores themes of racism, gender roles, and religion.
Reaction to this decision has been mixed. Some are praising the Durham District School Board for “modernizing” the curriculum while others can't understand the problems it may cause.
I'm all for diversifying the books students read. In fact, I think new literature should be added to the reading list every year — but there are some novels that should absolutely be read and To Kill A Mockingbird is one of them.
First of all, young people should be exposed to different kinds of literature, especially if it explores themes that make them uncomfortable. This is how they learn about history and aspects of life they may be unfamiliar with. Too often, especially in school, teachers lean towards political correctness. In typical Canadian fashion, no one wants to offend someone else. But, if there is one place students should feel comfortable enough to ask questions that may not be acceptable in current society, it's at school! If all of the “controversial” books are removed from shelves or are provided as an option rather than a requirement, how will students be exposed to different walks of life?
The argument that this book may be offensive to some people is ridiculous. It's a historic novel that presents real themes that still impact people today. Sure, the language can be a bit intense (no one likes the n-word), but how else can teachers begin a conversation about why those phrases and words are not acceptable now? A good novel has a way of introducing topics that may be disturbing or controversial, and allows for real discussion. I think all students should be encouraged to read books that explore themes like religion, gender, politics, and racism.
At the same time, I support the idea that new and modern books should be re-introduced into the curriculum. But, why not put these two ideas together? Instead of making students choose between a book written in the 2000s and one written in the 1960s, make them read both! Expose young people to a variety of literature, including those written in Canada. Who says students have to focus on one book a year? I say, the more the merrier.
So, Durham, I hope you have thought this through. Don't deprive students from the teachings of a classic and important novel just because it may make some of them uncomfortable. It will only hurt them in the long run.

Two passenger trains have collided near the city of Mathura in northern India, killing at least 22 people.
One of the trains, the Mewar Express, was stopped at a red signal when the Goa Express rammed into it from behind, a railway official said.
Rescuers used gas cutters to enter the train. About 22 people were injured and taken to hospital.
Officials say the rescue operation is now over and all the passengers have been accounted for.
'Massive jolt'
The crash took place just before 5am local time (2330 GMT).
"The Goa Express train rammed into the Mewar Express train from behind, this is the situation. A coach of the Mewar Express was damaged, whereas, there has been damage in the pantry car of the Goa Express," the Reuters news agency quoted railway official RD Tripathi as saying.
"We felt a massive jolt," Ramesh Charan, a passenger aboard the Mewar Express, told Reuters.
"Some people sleeping on upper berths fell to the coach floor by the impact of the collision," he said.
Army teams joined civil authorities to carry on rescue operations at the site of the collision. Railways Minister Mamata Bannerji has announced an inquiry into the collision.
A railway spokesman told the BBC that buses and a relief train had been arranged to bring the rescued passengers to the capital, Delhi.
The state-owned Indian railways form an immense network connecting every corner of the vast country.
It operates 9,000 passenger trains and carries 18 million passengers every day.
In December 2012 we stumbled into look at our new guinea pig Delilah to see she had given birth to a still born and one live baby. That live baby was our Tazzie.
Tazzie grew quick and strong and so did her personality, you could never be quite sure who was the dominant one. You would always see Taz trying to claim her ground wagging her bum and purring. But deep down she was a sweet heart.
She loved her tomato and lettuce and enjoyed sampling our home grown produce before anyone else. She squeaked every time a bag was opened or the fridge opened, her cute little high pitched squeak. She loved her food more than anything but when she had floor time she loved to run and often pop corned around the floor, usually following Delilah. She loved to play in the grass and would come back inside double the size she went out.
Tazzie loved human boys, she would nibble on any mans hand and loved to snuggle up with my fiance Joe. I often called her his other girlfriend as I would often walk in and find her buried in his dressing gown,or down his shirt. They always had cuddles and it was hard to get her out of his shirt. They were the best of friends and she will always be his first guinea pig love.
A few months ago we found a hard lump on Taz's jaw, we took her to the vet and we had tests done but nothing was conclusive. It was thought perhaps she had broken her bone on her fiddles sticks. She was ok though and basically told not much we can do besides wait it out. This didn't affect her at all she was and always will be the brilliant personality of Taz.
Then Delilah developed a slight wheeze so we sought treatment for her but Taz was not put on medication as she showed no sign. Then sadly on the eve of the 28th April 2016 she became withdrawn, no longer squeaked, didn't want to eat and was limp.
We all gave her hugs, provided her warmth and Delilah stayed glued to her side. Early hours in the morning on the 29th April 2016 Tazzie sadly passed away at the age of 3years 4months with Delilah by her side.
Tazzie was a personality that will never be forgotten. Her squeak maybe be quiet but she lives on in our hearts and she is in a better place now where she can eat all the grass she wants. She has left a large hole in our family and our beautiful baby will be m issed, most of all by Delilah. It can be assumed that Taz had a form of cancer from her symptoms it seems perhaps bone cancer in her jaw.
On behalf of Taz I will be donating money to the local Guinea Pig rescue, hopefully after following Taz's story and reading this you might also like to donate through their gofundme page.
As USA Gymnastics faces a headline-making sex abuse scandal, a report has surfaced highlighting pleas from USA Swimming officials for the U.S. Olympic Committee to implement policies that would protect young athletes from abuse — warnings the USOC allegedly failed to heed.
By 2010, dozens of swimming coaches had been banned for life by USA Swimming for sexual misconduct, ABC News reported. Now, two letters obtained by USA Today show that USA Swimming urged the USOC in late 2004 and early 2005 to take steps to ensure the safety of athletes in numerous sports.
Get push notifications with news, features and more.
In those letters, then USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus asked that the USOC create programs across all national governing bodies at a local level to protect young athletes from abuse, according to USA Today.
“When we look at other national youth organizations (YMCA, Boy Scouts., etc.) with grassroots constituencies we see national policies that help to guide the locally-based programs … and we think this overarching approach is something that the USOC should seriously consider,” Wieglus wrote in the second letter, per the newspaper.
However, rather than address the organization's recommendations, the USOC referred the officials to a company that performed background checks.
Now, more than 100 names are on the USA Swimming banned list, most for sexual misconduct, according to USA Today, and the governing body has been named in at least eight lawsuits for its alleged mishandling of abuse allegations. Wieglus has since apologized for its handling of sex abuse complaints, and withdrew his name from consideration for the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2014, the newspaper reports.
USOC CEO Scott Blackmun offered this statement to USA Today: “One thing that has been made clear as we learn more and more about the past is that the Olympic community failed to protect its athletes. We are profoundly sorry and wish we had acted sooner and more aggressively.”
The news comes just days after three retired gymnasts told the Senate Judiciary Committee of their experiences of child abuse while competing for USA Gymnastics.
Gold medalist Dominique Moceanu, bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher and three-time national champion rhythmic gymnast Jessica Howard all testified and expressed their support for a bill that would make it a crime for national governing sports bodies to fail to report child sexual abuse allegations promptly.

Dantzscher and Howard also spoke out in February, alleging that former team doctor Larry Nassar began abusing them in the 1990s.
Robert Killips/Lansing State Journal/USA TODAY NETWORK
Nassar served as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics from 1996 to 2015. USA Gymnastics has since fired Nassar and the FBI launched its own investigation into the sexual abuse allegations.
Nassar, 53, has been charged with 25 counts of criminal sexual conduct and multiple counts of child pornography, ESPN reports. He has pleaded not guilty to three sexual assault charges in Michigan, and has been incarcerated without bond, the Associated Press reports.
As the scandal continued, USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny resigned from his position after USOC officials urged him to do so.

The FBI and the Texas Rangers said Saturday they have launched an investigation into the downing of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter near the Rio Grande in Laredo.
CBP said the helicopter "was struck several times by ground fire" about 5 p.m. on Friday. The rounds penetrated and damaged the aircraft and forced the pilot to make an emergency landing. No one was injured in the incident.
The helicopter was forced to land near an industrial park on the city's Northwest Side, according to Joe Baeza, a Laredo police spokesman.
Authorities did not reveal whether the gunshots originated in the United States or in Mexico, but the FBI is seeking tips in the investigation.
CBP, FBI, Texas Rangers, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Laredo police all responded to the scene of the downed helicopter.
A total of five shots were fired at the helicopter, but only two struck the craft, according to a report in the Laredo Morning Times
FBI and the Texas Rangers continue to investigate and further details are not expected until next week.
On Tuesday, a district court judge in Texas slammed the door shut on a defamation lawsuit filed on behalf of "Clock Boy" Ahmed Mohamed by his father against a host of people and companies, including a local Fox News affiliate, Glenn Beck, TheBlaze, and the mayor of Irving, Texas.
Mohamed rose to fame about a year ago when he brought a clock that looked a whole lot more like a bomb than a clock to his high school in Irving. When Mohamed began acting strangely, the police came in and briefly detained him, after which he was suspended for three days for what school authorities suspected was a "hoax bomb" stunt. Clock Boy's family and the Counsel on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) pushed the incident as a textbook example of "Islamophobia" and the then-14-year-old became the darling of the Left, endearing himself to none other than President Barack Obama, who praised the clock he "invented" (he actually just took the outer casing off an already working clock and put it in a sketchy looking case) as a "cool" and invited him to the White House.
His father sued Center for Security Policy's Jim Hanson and Beck because of statements made by Hanson on Beck's show about "the connection between the Clock Boy hoax bomb affair, the attendant media frenzy created in large part by his father Mohamed, civilization jihad, and the Counsel on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Muslim Brotherhood-Hamas front group in the United States that promotes civilization jihad."
According to the American Freedom Law Center's account of the trial, the attorney for Clock Boy did not have her best day in court:
During the lengthy hearing, Judge [Maricela] Moore pressed Mohamed's lawyer, Fort Worth attorney Susan Hutchison, to provide any facts that would suggest that Hanson and the other defendants had said anything false or defamatory about Mohamed or his son during the television broadcasts. After spending a painfully embarrassing 15 minutes flipping through reams of paper, Mohamed's lawyer was unable to provide any such evidence.
While Mohamed's attorney seemed to find it difficult to come up with much to say, the lawyers with AFLC , which filed the motion to dismiss the groundless charges on behalf of two of the people accused by Clock Boy, apparently did not have a hard time making their arguments.
During the hearing, AFLC co-founder and senior counsel David Yerushalmi explained to Judge Moore that the purpose of the lawfare-driven lawsuit was to intimidate into silence those who might comment publicly on the connection between jihad, terrorism, sharia, and Islam. As such, Yerushalmi argued, "this case is a classic Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation or ‘SLAPP' case and should be dismissed.”
Judge Moore issued her ruling the same day, dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice.
After he left the courtroom, Yerushalmi offered some more thoughts on the attempts of Islamists to silence critics. "This lawsuit filed by Clock Boy's father is yet another example of Islamist lawfare, which is a component of the Muslim Brotherhood's civilization jihad," he said, adding, "The Islamists employ the progressive mainstream media to label any public criticism of a sharia-centric, jihad-driven Islam as 'Islamophobic,' and they add fear and financial ruin to the equation by utilizing the legal system to file SLAPP actions."
The Obama administration is set to announce another major delay in implementing the Affordable Care Act, easing election pressure on Democrats.
As early as this week, according to two sources, the White House will announce a new directive allowing insurers to continue offering health plans that do not meet ObamaCare's minimum coverage requirements.

Prolonging the “keep your plan” fix will avoid another wave of health policy cancellations otherwise expected this fall.
The cancellations would have created a firestorm for Democratic candidates in the last, crucial weeks before Election Day.
The White House is intent on protecting its allies in the Senate, where Democrats face a battle to keep control of the chamber.
“I don't see how they could have a bunch of these announcements going out in September,” one consultant in the health insurance industry said. “Not when they're trying to defend the Senate and keep their losses at a minimum in the House. This is not something to have out there right before the election.”
The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday both said they had no updates to announce.
Late last year, the administration was grappling with the beleaguered HealthCare.gov and millions of canceled health plans in the individual market.
Republicans noted President Obama had repeatedly promised that no one would lose their health plan if they wanted to keep it.
Obama subsequently called on states and the insurance industry to allow people to keep their existing plans for an additional year. While many states agreed, it left the administration with a dilemma.
A one-year moratorium pushed the deadline beyond the midterm election, but insurers must send out cancellation notices 90 days in advance. That would mean notices in the mail by Oct. 1, five weeks before voters go to the polls.
The administration's decision to pursue another extension was confirmed by insurance sources who predicted a public announcement would be “imminent.” It is unclear how long the extension will be, though one source believed it could last to the end of Obama's second term, and perhaps beyond.
This issue is sure to be discussed during the 2016 presidential race, in which Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE is expected to run.
In November, amid the rash of health plan cancellations, former President Clinton said Obama should allow people to keep their current coverage.
“I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,” Clinton said at the time.
Allowing insurers to continue offering noncompliant health plans for several years would substantially alter the health insurance landscape under ObamaCare.
It would also undercut one rationale for the healthcare reform law.
Under the Affordable Care Act, health plans are required to offer 10 medical benefits that the Obama administration deems essential.
Some of the services are popular, such as prescription drug coverage, but others, such as maternity and pediatric care, have been criticized as expensive as well as being unnecessary for many policyholders, such as older people.
Nonetheless, the White House has consistently argued its requirements improve health insurance standards and shield consumers from unexpected costs associated with bare-bones policies.
“There are a number of Americans, fewer than 5 percent of Americans, who've got cut-rate plans that don't offer real financial protection in the event of a serious illness or an accident,” Obama said in Boston in October.
“Remember, before the Affordable Care Act, these bad-apple insurers had free rein every single year to limit the care that you received, or use minor preexisting conditions to jack up your premiums or bill you into bankruptcy. So a lot of people thought they were buying coverage, and it turned out not to be so good.”
The new standards have also created a political mess for the White House by forcing insurance companies to cancel policies that do not comply.
The rush of cancellation letters last fall forced Obama to acknowledge that he had been wrong to promise that Americans could keep their plans under the reform. The administration later said that people with canceled plans could buy catastrophic policies once intended mainly for young people.
While the storm has quieted since the fall, Republicans are eager to note that many vulnerable Democrats also promised before ObamaCare passed that consumers could keep their plans.
“If you like the insurance that you have, you'll be able to keep it,” Sen. Mary Landrieu Mary Loretta LandrieuLobbying world Former New Orleans mayor: It's not my 'intention' to run for president Dems grasp for way to stop Trump's Supreme Court pick MORE (D-La.) said on MSNBC's “Hardball” in 2009.
Landrieu, a GOP target in her 2014 election, has since proposed a bill that would allow people in the individual market to keep their current policies as long as they continue to pay their premiums. Other vulnerable Senate Democrats back the legislation.
“When we passed the Affordable Care Act, we did so with the intention that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it,” Landrieu said in November. “A promise was made, and this legislation will ensure that this promise is kept.”
Health insurers are meeting in Washington, D.C., this week for two major conferences hosted by their trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans.
Several sources said they had heard chatter about an extension but that the administration had not made efforts to discuss the possibility with industry officials.
“From a political standpoint, that's expected,” said one source of the silence. “Nobody is surprised. It's not like it's our first time around.”
The industry has been the subject of a variety of delays and extensions in ObamaCare's rollout over the past five months.
One company executive complained that the White House's tendency to shift deadlines makes it hard to price health policies accurately.
“These continual delays, these stops and starts, make it very difficult because we set rates based on predictive modeling,” the executive said.
“When you change the rules, it has a detrimental impact on your ability to calculate your risk pool and your prices.”
Over the past 24 hours, two extraordinary speeches have happened. The County Executive and I wanted to address them. And to share, clearly, our thoughts as we draw closer to the St. Louis County grand jury's decision and any reaction to it.
Yesterday, United States Attorney General Eric Holder, whose Justice Department is currently investigating Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson and Ferguson police department practices, took the nearly unprecedented step of addressing this local judicial situation and police responses to it. His statement acknowledged that the vast majority of police officers across this country honorably defend their fellow citizens on a daily basis. They are dedicated to public safety. He said that the federal Justice Department had issued new guidelines to help federal, state, and local enforcement officers safeguard the Constitutional rights of protesters while maintaining public safety. And, he called on protesters to conduct themselves peacefully.
Also yesterday, Michael Brown, Sr., in a courageous new video that many of you have now seen, issued the same call as Attorney General Holder for peace and change. "No matter what the grand jury decides," he said, "I don't want my son's death to be in vain."
And, I'm here to tell you that it can't be. And, it won't be. For the past hundred days, Charlie and I - and our police commanders - have engaged in many conversations with community leaders and with some of the protest leaders about the days to come after the grand jury decision.
That is because we believe in would be imprudent not to plan for protests, regardless of the grand jury's decision.
We have been criticized by some for sitting down with the protest leaders. The protest's leaders have been criticized for sitting down with us. We did so because in similar situations in other cities, things ended up very, very badly. We do not want that for our region. This is our City, and we live here together.
With that in mind, our police commanders engaged with some protest leaders on rules of conduct. In person and on conference calls, the two sides have met five times to discuss them.
The police commanders - and Charlie and I -- agreed to most of the rules because they made sense, or, we already follow them. We did not agree to some of the proposed rules because those rules would have limited officers' ability to keep people and property safe.
The bottom line is that we have instructed our police officers to protect the protesters' Constitutional rights. We have directed them to use more active tactics only when necessary to keep people safe or to protect property.
If there are protests, we expect some of the protesters will be disruptive. They will likely try, as they did in October, to inconvenience people to make their point.
If protesters are not violent, police will not be aggressive. But, if some protesters turn violent or threatening, police will respond to keep everyone safe - including bystanders, the peaceful protesters, and police officers themselves.
When demonstrators are being civilly disobedient, they will, in most cases, be given a chance to adhere to the law before they are arrested. And then, if necessary, they will be arrested in a non violent manner.
Depending on the circumstances, we may allow them to occupy public space longer than normally tolerated. That will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
Our departments will dress appropriately to protect themselves --not to intimidate peaceful protesters.
Police tactics will not change based on the words protesters use -- but their actions.
Our goal, our job, and our prayer, is that at the end of each day, everyone goes home safe- police, protesters, and people who are not involved; that there is no widespread damage to people's homes and businesses; and that we are in a position to begin to heal, to close the racial divide, and to make the changes needed to make St. Louis a more fair and just city for everyone.
Charlie and I both strongly support law enforcement. The vast majority of our City and County officers are well trained professionals who have done an incredible job during the protests, and even before that, keeping people safe and protecting people's rights. During "Ferguson October," police officers were the targets of a great deal of invective. Some protesters tried to bait City police officers into taking aggressive action. Not one of our officers took the bait. They showed tremendous restraint and professionalism. They showed the world that they are one of the best police departments in the country. I fully expect that they will do their jobs just as well this time.
It is important to remember that we are going to have to work together to make needed change to make St. Louis more fair, more just and more prosperous for everyone. I ask everyone - protesters and police officers and everyone else --to remember our underlying goal: to protect the demonstrators' constitutional rights and to keep everyone safe.
Sixty-five years ago, President Harry Truman said: Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.
St. Louis, City and region, is not - not - going to go down that path.
The 7 Deadly Sins Of Self Development
I don't suppose there really are any deadly sins with self development, I was being overly dramatic with the title.
But there certainly are areas where I see people make the same mistakes again and again and again, and you don't have to be one of them
If that is, you avoid the following 7 self development deadly(ish) sins:
1: Thinking Being Hard On Yourself Is The Best Way Forward
I have been beating this drum so long I've had to have it re-skinned six times, but I shall never stop while there's strength in my arms and some breath in my body, so let's get it over with.
You simply cannot be the best person you can be by being hard on yourself 24/7.
I've never had a client tell me beating themselves up achieved anything other than feeling shit about life and hammering their self-esteem.
The usual refrain at this point is, “But if I go easy on myself I'll never achieve anything”
Bollocks, bollocks, and thrice I say bollocks.
I'll tell you what, let's make a deal.
You go easy on yourself for a week, and if at the end of that period you feel worse about things, I'll happily Tweet than I'm the world's most incompetent Life Coach.
Treat yourself as you would a younger family (preferably one you like and no the brat of a nephew who picks his nose all the time and you could happily punch in the face) and demonstrate compassion and empathy.
Self-compassion is not self-indulgence, it's not self-centered and it's not selfish.
It is sensible, productive, and the right thing to do however. And the huge upside is, people who feel good about themselves are far more likely to be successful.
2: Thinking Stability And/Or Security Are Achievable
Working with clients through their values is the most important work I do (which is why I wrote (Aligning With Your Core Values) and it's crucial that I understand what really, drives them from the ground up.
I see the values of ‘security' and/or ‘stability' regularly on the lists clients send me before we go through the process.
Even though I will leave them in for the purposes of the exercise I will always explain afterward that they aren't really values.
And the reason they can't be values is because they're completely unattainable.
Rich people go bankrupt, healthy people get sick, successful businesses get shut down and good marriages go wrong.
Not only that, but we all die no matter how stable or secure we think we are.
I'm not saying be reckless and never plan for the future.
I am saying though, don't chase security and stability because you won't achieve them for anything but a fleeting moment in time.
All you will do is make dealing with negative situations like a job loss, marriage break down or serious silliness harder when they do arrive.
It is possible to be secure and stable in the fact that you can never be secure and stable.
Amazingly enough meditation will help you on that front, so check it out.
3: Thinking There's Something Wrong With You If You Don't Know What Your Goals In Life Are
If I read one more time on a self development blog or hear from one more Life Coach that everybody should know what their big goals in life are and what they are passionate about I may well just put a gun to my head.
Or better still, their head.
At least half of my clients have no clue as to what they want out of life, they just know they want more.
And guess what?
That's ok.
It's my job to help them get clarity on what they want, not sit back and refuse to work with people that aren't half way there.
The reason I give away a comprehensive book on goal setting to people who subscribe to my newsletter, is because goal setting is easy.
I can teach you how to set goals in half an hour and you really don't need to hire a Life Coach to do so.
Knowing what goals to set is another matter altogether though, and that can often be the tricky part.
If you are feeling down on yourself because you don't know what you want to do when you grow up, see sin #1 and chill.
Maybe you're not meant to know yet, or maybe you just need some help?
The one thing I know for sure though is that there are hundreds of millions of people worldwide just like you, speaking of which….
4: Thinking You're More Weird Than Everybody Else
On a fairly regular basis I see the, “You're not going to believe this” look on a clients face.
It's the look that tells me they think they're about to tell me something that will have me scrambling for the straight jacket and pepper spray.
When (as is always the case) I don't bat an eyelid, there is a moment of doubt that I heard them properly.
That's followed by uncertainty about my mental state because I'm not looking a lot more concerned at their obvious confession of raging insanity.
And finally, they look relieved when I explain I'm not worried because I've heard it a hundred times before and they're nothing like as nuts as they presumed they were, because they're just a Human Being with Human being type issues.
You may well think you're a bit weird and that your problems are a tad worse than others, but you're almost certainly wrong.
We're all a bit weird!
Of course I can't say for sure you're not beyond the pale, but I'm fairly sure. In 7 years of Life Coaching hundreds of clients I can only remember working with one client who genuinely had me thinking, “WTF!!! Please somebody help me”
5: Thinking Somebody Else Can Tell You How It Is For You
I'm a Life Coach and as such some people when they first contact me think it is my job to tell them what to do.
It isn't.
My job is to ask great self development questions and help them to think about things differently so they can hopefully use that new perspective to make beneficial changes.
I'm really happy and grateful you read my blog, but please understand this. I don't know now, and indeed never will know, exactly how it is for you.
I know how it is for me, and I can guess how it may be for you based on my experience in working with others, but that's as far as I will ever go.
You have to make your own path in life.
Sure you can read, you can watch, you can gather advice from people who you respect and you can even hire a Life Coach if you're a wise soul.
But, in the final analysis you have to take full responsibility (and see #1 if you think that means being tough on yourself) and decide what's right for you.
And yes, before you ask, that does apply to this post. If it doesn't resonate or make sense to you, then ignore it, and me for that matter.
6: Thinking That Next Thing Will Make You Happy
Do you exist in the 20% world like so many people?
People who believe 20% more money will make them happy. Or a 20% bigger house will finally allow them to be content. Or maybe even 20% more qualifications means they are smart enough.
You're intelligent (don't argue, see #1) and I'm going to presume you know that happiness comes from the inside out and not vice versa.
Research in positive psychology suggests 10% of your happiness levels are dictated by your environment, 50% is genetic and 40% is your attitude.
Knowing that as you do, what would stop you fine-tuning your attitude to be happier (presuming you want to be happier that is) rather than busting your balls trying to change your environment.*
Do the math. An attitude adjustment is not only easier, it's way more likely to be successful.
* Note: Even if you do change your environment unless it's something serious like getting out of an abusive relationship hedonic adaptation will soon kick in and you will be back to square one wanting more.
7: Thinking You Have To Have All The Answers
Are you the kind of person that has to read one more book before you can start your own business, or attend one more workshop before you can start to implement the self development advice you already have?
You probably don't.
Sometimes you just need to get up off your ass and do it. Sometimes you have to be relaxed knowing you don't have all the answers and that you never will have. And I do mean never!
So there you have it. I'm sure there are lots more deadly sins and if you have some please let me know in the comments.
NLP Training
My next post is going to be purely and simply to advise you about some amazing training that is coming up soon in Colorado and Washington DC.
Even though it's NLP, it's not just for coaches and people who work in the therapeutic fields. It's also for people that take their own self development very seriously and it being conducted by some of the best trainers in the field of NLP.
If that's not your kind of thing, feel free to ignore, but if you do want to read about some groundbreaking training, then check back on Wednesday. And if you have no idea what NLP is, check out my post, NLP: Science Or Magic?
The AWS team previewing AppSync at reInvent
AWS AppSync, built with Apollo A first look at Amazon's newest GraphQL product Peggy Rayzis Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 29, 2017 Yesterday at reInvent, Amazon launched AppSync, a new GraphQL service featuring real-time updates and built-in offline support. Managed in the AWS console, AppSync's GraphQL layer aggregates data from other AWS products such as ElasticSearch and DynamoDB. In your application, you query your GraphQL API with the AppSync Client, available for web and native. The AppSync announcement got a lot of love from the developer community, and it's easy to see why people are excited about GraphQL! Architecting your application with GraphQL enables you to build complex features quickly by simply describing your data requirements and letting your GraphQL layer take care of the rest. Companies like the New York Times, Coursera, and Express have led the way by powering their most important applications with GraphQL. Naturally, we were curious to learn more about AppSync. Once we dug into the open-source code, we were excited to see that the AppSync Client implementations are based on the same MIT-licensed Apollo technology you know and love: Apollo Client 2.0, Apollo iOS, and Apollo Codegen! Read on to learn how different components of these Apollo projects power some of the coolest features of the AppSync platform. Leveraging Apollo Client's extensibility Last month, we officially released Apollo Client 2.0 at GraphQL Summit 2017. In addition to making it smaller and faster, one of our main goals was to also make it much more modular. You now have the ability to plug in your own cache and tailor your network stack to your application's requirements with Apollo Link. It turns out that Apollo Client 2.0's modular architecture was a huge win for developers looking to customize their GraphQL client, because that's exactly how the AWS team was able to build AppSync Client!
AWS AppSync leverages the modular architecture of Apollo Client
In only a few weeks, the AWS team was able to make complex features like offline support and authentication a reality by extending the Apollo InMemoryCache and using Apollo Link to customize their network interface. We think this is a testament to the extensibility of Apollo Client and hope their example inspires more teams to experiment with personalizing their GraphQL client. Let's dive into how AWS accomplished this. Apollo Link enables offline support To achieve offline support, the AWS team created a custom Apollo Link that takes a Redux store augmented by redux-offline for persistence. This link also queues up any pending mutations and calls to refetch queries when the device is offline and stores them in a Redux subtree to be executed when the device goes back online. Since the AppSync Client is based on Apollo Client, you still get the benefit of optimistic UI responses even if the device is offline when the mutation is fired. Connect the AppSync client to your application with React Apollo We're also working on improving the offline experience to create easy persistence that isn't dependent on Redux and advanced features such as applying a timeout to the offline mutation queue to avoid potential conflicts. If you'd like to learn more about these initiatives, come join the party on the apollo-cache-asyncstorage repo! 🎉 We'd love to hear your input and welcome any contributions. Real-time data with GraphQL subscriptions One AppSync feature that generated a lot of buzz is its emphasis on real-time data. Under the hood, AppSync's real-time feature is powered by GraphQL subscriptions. While Apollo bases its subscriptions on WebSockets via subscriptions-transport-ws, subscriptions in GraphQL are actually flexible enough for you to base them on another messaging technology. Instead of WebSockets, AppSync's subscriptions use MQTT as the transport layer. The AWS team even wrote their own Apollo Link to execute subscriptions over MQTT, which we think is a really cool use case. If you'd like to integrate real-time features into your application in only a few lines of code with Apollo Link, please check out our example which serves queries & mutations over HTTP and subscriptions over WebSockets. We'd also like to hear from you on the subscriptions-transport-ws repo if you have any suggestions on how to improve our transport layer. Native client with Apollo iOS & Apollo Codegen Another cool feature of AWS AppSync is that it's compatible with different platforms. It works with JavaScript and also with native platforms written in Swift. One of our main goals for Apollo is that you can use it with any type of architecture, which is why we collaborated with the community on Apollo iOS and Apollo Android. It's exciting to see AppSync builds on that foundation to power their native client!
AppSync's iOS client is based on Apollo iOS
[The message I delivered on Esther 1:10-22 at Church of Mary Magdalene on May 17, 2017. Click here for a livestream video of the message.]
I am so excited to be doing this sermon series on Esther! We are going to spend the next six weeks with the book of Esther, though Esther has not appeared yet. It's one of the few books of the bible about a woman and named after a woman. You can see why it would appeal to Church of Mary Magdalene.
This week we are focusing on the most powerful people in the kingdom: the royal family and court advisors. Next week, we will look at the people with the least power: the oppressed and enslaved.
I wanted to start this with my personal connection with Esther. Some little girls dress up as Disney princesses—I dressed up as Queen Esther. My family didn't celebrate Halloween, went to a church “harvest festival” instead, and sometimes we dressed as Bible characters instead of regular Halloween costumes. I have two sisters and one year we all dressed up as Queen Esther. We were three Queen Esthers because there aren't many girl Bible characters to choose from, and so my mom thought we should all be Queen Esther. We wore pink pillowcases, with arm and neck holes cut out, and tiaras.
I remember hearing this story a lot when I was a kid. It's one of the stories that we tell children. I loved how it focused on Esther, as a woman, and her bravery, but I didn't realize how funny it is. Re-reading it, I've noticed what a funny story it is! And that's a really nice break in the Bible—there isn't a whole lot of humor.
As I was reading this passage, I kept thinking of this retelling of the story with the king and his bros hanging out. The context here is that the king and his bros have been drinking for seven days and partying for a really long time. So this is my retelling of this passage:
The king (Xerxes) and his buddies have been drinking for seven days:
KING: You know what would be awesome? Let's get the queen out here. She is so smoking hot, you guys, you don't even know.
QUEEN: Yeah, no.
KING: What? That bitch! What should I do?
MEMUCAN: Dude. You can't take that. All of our wives will hear about it too, and then they won't respect us at all! Anyway, you're better off without her. We'll find you somebody better. And totally post about it on Facebook so that everyone knows who wears the pants.
KING: Awesome idea, bro. Imma do it.
The first question that came to me was: What about Vashti? I had heard this story about her, but she doesn't actually even show up in this story. There is very little about her. In the verse before this, we know that she also had a party that lasted for seven days. And that's pretty much it: she's the queen, she had a party, and she said no to the king when he asked her to come.
I thought about these stories that I would hear as a child about Vashti. Some of the stories set up a false dichotomy: she was the bad queen and Esther was the good queen. So, you get rid of Vashti to make way for Esther. I really dislike this kind of story, where there are two female characters and they are pitted against each other. Also, it doesn't work here, because Vashti disobeys the king here and Esther disobeys the king later. They are both disobedient queens, with different results.
So I wanted to spend a little time with Vashti and the lessons that we can learn from Vashti in this passage.
The main thing that we know about Vashti in this passage is that the king is objectifying her. The king commanded the eunuchs “to bring Queen Vashti before the king, wearing the royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the officials her beauty; for she was fair to behold.” The king sees her as an object, something that he owns and wants to show off.
There have been centuries of debate about this order to bring her in her royal crown. Rabbis have argued for a long time that maybe the king was asking her to come in only her royal crown, and that he was showing off all of her physical beauty to his officials and the peoples. But regardless of whether she was naked or clothed, he only wanted her for her beauty and to reflect his own power—the power of this man who owned this woman.
But Vashti says no. This is the one thing Vashti does in this passage: she says no to the king. This made me think of how when I was in college, I used to volunteer with the YWCA, and we taught a curriculum for middle school students called “I Decide.” The focus of the curriculum was: I decide what happens to my body. I decide what I am going to do with that. We focused on sexuality, particularly for young women, and how they get to decide what they want to do and ask other people what they want to do, so that there is consent.
This was really important for me in college. I was teaching the curriculum, but that hadn't quite sunk in for me—that I got to decide what happened to my body, and I got to say when someone was doing something to me that trespassed what I wanted.
And so I was thinking about those young girls and their concerns, and thinking about myself, and thinking about Vashti here. The book of Esther famously does not mention God. It is the only book in the Bible that does not mention God. As someone who is spending time with this passage and looking for God in it, this is where I find God. I find that spark of the divine in Vashti when she says no. She has agency in a culture that objectified her.
This is threatening. Vashti saying no is terrifying to the men that she says no to. It is terrifying to the king and to the men who hear about this, that their wives might start disobeying them. This shows the weakness of the king and the weakness of the power structure. Here we have a king who wants to be strong, but he is weak and controlled by the people who surround him.
He completely overreacts and declares that he will never see Vashti again. He tells this to all of the lands that he rules—a little like an early morning Tweet. And he doesn't get what he wants! He doesn't get to see Vashti. But she gets what she wants: she doesn't have to see the king. And when he tells all the lands, more people heard the story than would otherwise.
So these are the lessons that I want to take from Vashti—to not dismiss her, even though she is a small character in this book. She is worth paying attention to. She decides what happens to her body. She says no to the king. And this has terrible consequences for her. Saying no doesn't always turn out well. But her actions showed the weakness of the male-dominated power structure. And whether it was true or not, the men thought she could take them down.
Signs of democratic reforms in Burma are welcome. But are they likely to help bring an end to ethnic unrest in Kachin state?
Burma's flurry of reform measures, coupled with the breezy spirit of openness prevailing in the former capital of Yangon, has created genuine hope that Burma's underlying fault line – its ethnic divisions – can now finally be resolved.
Yet the ongoing conflict in the northern state of Kachin looks like it could remain an intractable blot on the landscape as Burma attempts to shake off a 40-year legacy of rule by a brutal military junta.
“The president called for a ceasefire in March. But more troops were sent,” says Ja Seng Khawn, daughter of former Kachin Independence Organization Chairman Brang Seng. “The conflict has intensified. Government troops burnt down villages, and 65,000 civilians have fled from their homes.”
Earlier this month, government troops moved closer to Laiza, the largest town inside the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) liberated zone. And, despite calls for peace talks, the fighting is continuing.
Karen, Kachin, Chin, Shan and other dissident ethnic forces have been demanding equal rights and local autonomy for more than forty years, and their repression at hands of the military has thwarted any attempt to create a genuine Union of Burma based on its myriad cultures and diversity.
Prospects appeared to be brightening with the apparent reform minded President Thein Sein reaching out to non-Burmans, and efforts to bring a halt to the fighting have enjoyed better results in the case of the Karen National Union and its armed wing. A draft agreement for a ceasefire has already been signed.
After decades of bitter conflict with the central government, the dissident Karen forces never dreamed that one day the president would invite their banned organization to peace talks in the capital. However, on April 12,Thein Sein hosted seven KNU leaders in Naypyidaw after another round of peace talks was successfully concluded in Yangon.
Various sets of talks have taken place with other small ethnic armies, including the Karenni, Chin, Shan and others, but it's primarily the resource rich Kachin state that finds itself excluded from the friendly embrace of the government's charm offensive.
Indeed, there's been very little charm exuded by the government peace panel responsible for the talks. The panel is led by Aung Thaung, a former industry minister described in leaked U.S. diplomatic cables as a “notorious hard-liner.” It has met a KIO Kachin delegation in China on three occasions, but without any success in reducing hostilities.
“Wecalled for military operations launched since June 2011 to stop, in order to achieve a ceasefire,” says Ja Seng Khawn, now based in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state, after years of working with the KIO leadership. “They didn't listen to us. There's no trust between the two sides.”
I owe @HillaryClinton an apology. I owe her supporters an apology. I supported @BernieSanders in the primary. I voted for @HillaryClinton in the election. But I was really voting against Donald Trump.
I liked Bernie because I believed in his message. I still do. He spoke about issues I cared about, long before I had ever heard of him.
I always imagined myself a disenfranchised voter, because I'm not a member of either party. I strongly believe a duopoly is undemocratic.
Bernie talked about this, but I realize now there are a lot of things Bernie didn't talk about it, or didn't talk about enough. For instance I may be disenfranchised, but I can still vote. There's a lot of people who cannot. They can't vote at all. In any election.
And there are other things he talked about too much. One of those things is Hillary. He gave my bias a voice. He wasn't honest about her. He painted her as a villain. She's not a villain. Donald Trump is a villain. He painted her as corrupt. Again, Donald Trump, anyone?
I realized today I had a strong bias against Hillary that isn't grounded in reality. I realized this because I see her differently now.
She's incredibly intelligent. She's deeply knowledgeable. And if she only cared about money, she wouldn't need either of those things. She would just run as a Republican. You don't need to know shit to accumulate wealth as a Republican. But she's a Democrat. By choice.
She made mistakes. We all do. But she was never treated fairly. Her mistakes weren't explained. They were used as fodder against her. I never got to know the real Hillary, because after a lifetime of assaults it was near-impossible for her to come across so authentic.
I now see how badly she has been mistreated. By Bernie. By the press. By me. I'm ashamed of that. And I'm deeply sorry about it too.
@HillaryClinton, I apologize I did not get to know you. You're the public servant we need, but never deserved. You'd make a great POTUS.

The suspects fled prior to the arrival of police, but were found a short time later in a vehicle, in the area of Mauna Loa Avenue and Vecino Drive, Henderson said.
The pellet gun had been thrown from the vehicle when the suspects fled the scene, but was recovered near the traffic stop, Henderson said.
A motive for the fight was unknown, he said. No injuries were reported.
Glendora residents Austin Montes, 18; Aasheer Sharma, 18; Ricardo Loza Jr., 18, and John Bitar, were booked on suspicion of battery and brandishing a firearm, he said.

The comments made by Cliven Bundy and Donald Sterling this month demonstrates that the U.S. is far from a colorblind society. And the reaction to their comments has drawn further attention to the fraught relationship between racism and partisan politics. When racist statements by high-profile figures are made public, some news commentators become preoccupied with trying to discern the speaker's political affiliation.
We were curious about the long-term trends in racial attitudes as expressed by Americans in polls. Are Republicans more likely to give arguably racist responses in surveys than Democrats? Have the patterns changed since President Obama took office in 2009?
Like The New York Times' Amanda Cox, we looked at a variety of questions on racial attitudes in the General Social Survey, which has been conducted periodically since 1972. The difference is that we looked at the numbers for white Democrats and white Republicans specifically, based on the way Americans identified themselves in the survey. Our focus was only on racial attitudes as expressed by white Americans toward black Americans (of course, racism can also exist between and among other racial groups).
Two warnings about this data. First, survey responses are an imperfect means of evaluating racism. Social desirability bias may discourage Americans from expressing their true feelings. Furthermore, the sample of Democrats and Republicans in the survey is not constant from year to year. If the partisan gap in racial attitudes toward blacks has widened slightly in the past few years, it may be because white racists have become more likely to identify themselves as Republican, and not because those Americans who already identified themselves as Republican have become any more racist.
We looked at eight questions from the General Social Survey. First, how many white Americans say they wouldn't consider voting for a black presidential candidate? In the 2010 edition of the survey, the most recent version to ask this question, 6 percent of white Republicans and 3 percent of white Demorcats said they would not. However, it's possible that these responses have something to do with Obama himself. In 2008, when Obama was a candidate rather than a president, the numbers were about equal among Republicans and Democrats. And at earlier times, white Democrats were more likely than white Republicans to say they wouldn't vote for a black president. In 1988, for instance, when Jesse Jackson was running for the Democratic nomination, 23 percent of white Democrats said they wouldn't vote for a black president, compared to 19 percent of white Republicans.
We can also look at whites' willingness to express negative feelings about blacks. From 1990 to 2008, white Republicans were just slightly more likely than white Democrats to say they considered blacks to be more “unintelligent” than “intelligent.” However, the numbers have fallen over time, and the small partisan gap erased itself in the past two surveys, 2010 and 2012, under Obama's presidency.
Another question asked respondents whether they regard blacks as more “lazy” or “hard-working.” White Republicans are slightly more likely than white Democrats to characterize blacks as “lazy,” and the numbers haven't changed much over time.
A related question asked respondents whether they think blacks lack the motivation to pull themselves out of poverty. The numbers on this one are high: In the 2012 survey, 57 percent of white Republicans and 41 percent of white Democrats agreed with the statement. This is also one question where the partisan gap has increased since Obama took office.
What about more personal attitudes toward interactions with African-Americans? A longstanding question on the survey has asked whites whether they'd object to a close relative marrying a black person. The percentage of white people saying so has fallen drastically over time, to 20 percent of white Democrats and 27 percent of white Republicans as of 2012. In 1990, by contrast, 65 percent of white Democrats and 71 percent of white Republicans said they'd object to an interracial marriage of a close relative.
Another question asked respondents whether they'd object to living in a half-black neighborhood. As with the marriage question, the number of white Americans saying they would object has fallen quite a bit since the 1990s. There generally hasn't been much of a partisan gap on this question.
Since 1996, the survey has also asked respondents whether they feel “close” to blacks. Closeness is obviously a subjective quality, and failing to feel close to those in another racial group doesn't necessarily imply racism. However, a survey question like this one may also be able to pick up on implicit racial attitudes that respondents would feel less comfortable asserting in questions about things like interracial marriage.
This question, in contrast to many of the others, has shown little change over time. It has also shown little partisan gap, although the number of white Republicans saying they don't feel close to blacks has increased some since Obama took office.
A final question asked Americans whether they think society spends too much money trying to improve the conditions of blacks. This is the most overtly political of the questions that we'll study. It also shows the largest partisan gap of any of the questions, and one that has increased since Obama took office.
In 2012, 32 percent of white Republicans said they thought society was spending too much money trying to improve blacks' conditions, compared to just 9 percent of white Democrats. However, it's important to note that some of the partisan gap may reflect attitudes toward government spending, rather than toward African-Americans specifically. For example, in 2012, 16 percent of white Republicans, but just 1 percent of white Democrats, said they thought the U.S. was spending too much money on trying to improve the education system.
Obviously, measuring racism is challenging — through surveys or by other means. If you take the question about voting for a black president as the best indicator of racism, then only about 5 percent of white Americans admit to racism toward blacks. If you regard the question about whether blacks lack motivation as indicative of racial antipathy, then about half of them do.
We combined the responses from the eight questions into one index of negative racial attitudes. We accomplished this by averaging the number of white Americans who provided the arguably racist response to each survey item, extrapolating the value for years in which the General Social Survey didn't ask a particular question based on the long-term trend in responses to it.
As of 2012, this index stood at 27 percent for white Republicans and 19 percent for white Democrats. So there's a partisan gap, although not as large of one as some political commentators might assert. There are white racists in both parties. By most questions, they represent a minority of white voters in both parties. They probably represent a slightly larger minority of white Republicans than white Democrats.
Fortunately, the expression of racism by whites toward blacks has decreased over time, and for Americans in both parties — at least, according to this survey. In 1990, the index of negative racial attitudes stood at 40 percent for white Democrats and 41 percent for white Republicans.
There hasn't been much of an overall increase or decrease in the index since Obama took office. On average, between the 2004 and 2006 editions of the surveys — the last two before Obama was either a president or a candidate — the index of negative racial attitudes stood at 22 percent for white Democrats and 26 percent for white Republicans. Those values are within the margin of error for those in the 2010 and 2012 surveys.
If there's a discouraging trend, it's not so much that negative racial attitudes toward blacks have increased in these polls, but that they've failed to decrease under Obama, as they did so clearly for most of the past three decades.
Vincent Ciccarone Playground, just off Arthur Avenue, is usually home to a Christmas tree. Not this year. View Full Caption Megan Cerullo
BELMONT — This year, it didn't take a grinch to steal Christmas in The Bronx.
The Belmont Business Improvement District has had to forego its annual Christmas tree and tree lighting ceremony this year, after an influx in homeless panhandlers forced them to hire a full-time security guard, they said.
“We aren't doing it this year because it's very expensive and we have had so many problems with vagrants that we had to hire security,” said Frank Franz, the treasurer for the Belmont Business Improvement District.
The guard — who was hired in July specifically to address the increase in panhandling along the popular strip of Italian restaurants and shops — costs $65,000 a year, a large chunk of the BID's $340,000 annual budget, they said.

The tree lighting usually runs about $15,000, including a 30-foot tree plucked from a farm in New Jersey, as well as a ceremony featuring music, entertainment and warm beverages, they said.
“The tree alone costs three or four thousand dollars,” said Franz. “And then Santa Claus was there, we had Christmas carolers, a stage we rent, a cleaning crew and security.”
Their annual ceremony — the only outdoor tree lighting in the area — has taken place for at least the past five years in the Vincent Ciccarone Playground, just off Arthur Avenue.
Last year's ceremony happened on Dec. 6 and drew hundreds of local residents and visitors, they said.
The BID held a meeting over the summer with their board members to discuss whether to opt for the guard or stick with the tree, according to BID Director Phil Marino. They ultimately decided to go with the guard, he said.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has come under fire for his administration's handling of the rise in homeless in NYC, including from his own Police Commissioner, William Bratton. The number of 311 complaints about homeless individuals in the city skyrocketed in the time since de Blasio took office, even as he and his team denied that it was a problem.
The mayor has since acknowledged that he and his administration could have done more to openly address the ongoing surge.
The Arthur Avenue strip consistently draws crowds of tourists — and, recently, an increasing number of panhandlers, BID officials added.
“Our sidewalks are more affluent than other parts of the Bronx,” said Franz. “So panhandlers know they get tips.
“Plus, Fordham University students tend to be, I don't know, more generous and giving.”
Earlier this year, streams of complaints by merchants about panhandlers flowed into the BID.
Angelina Lavali, who works at Madonia Brothers Bakery, said that she's lost patience with beggars coming into her store.
“One day I said to one of them, ‘Get out of here, you are making more money than I do and you are acting like a bum,'” she said.
She says that for the most part, the BID's new security guard has helped keep the homeless off of Arthur Avenue. “It's gotten better because we have security. A guy walks every day here and it's very good for the merchants,” she said.
Some panhandlers still linger, locals say.
“There is one crazy lady who asks for money all the time... She bothers customers,” said Orazio Carciotto, owner of Casa Della Mozzarella. “But now, most of the time it's OK. It's better than before.”
Even without the tree and the ceremony, the BID has still done its best to keep the area festive — spending between $35,000 and $40,000 to decorate about 25 blocks with lights.
They'll also have carolers, a roaming Santa Claus making the rounds, and warm beverages that will be offered to patrons waiting on long, cold lines.
“The lights are up and it's very festive. The neighborhood is packed,” said Michael Teitel, whose father owns the Teitel Brothers specialty food shop, which celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.
And they say there will be plenty of other Christmas trees, albeit indoors.
This year for the first time, the Arthur Avenue Retail Market will host an indoor tree lighting on Dec. 3, where “Sopranos” star Dominic Chianese will sing and sign autographs.
The Lucia Brothers Funeral Home will also sponsor a tree lighting at Our Lady Of Mount Carmel Church.
Carciotto of Casa Della Mozzarella said he won't attend either of the indoor ceremonies, however.
“I think in the park it's better because it's a public place,” he said. “I think it's a big deal. I think the tree looks nice in the middle of the street.”

Student Government sponsored a table last Thursday in coordination with Voters Not Politicians, a committee devoted to educating Michiganders about gerrymandering and changing current district boundaries.
Gerrymandering, or partisan redistricting as it is alternatively called on their website, “occurs when politicians draw voting map lines unfairly to benefit themselves or their political party.”
The table was collecting petition signatures to put a proposal onto the November 2018 Michigan gubernatorial election. According to the volunteers and website, their goal is to “create an independent redistricting commission.” This commission would be comprised of “thirteen Michigan voters with no political ties, chosen randomly from a pool of volunteers.”
The 13 individuals would be four Republicans, four Democrats, and five Independents. They would hold public hearings across Michigan to gather input from residents on how to best create district boundaries based on six criteria. Those criteria are: population, contiguity, communities, fairness, boundaries, and compactness.
The Speaker of the Senate for Student Government, Sasha Freeman, voiced her support for the proposal by sitting alongside volunteers to encourage students to sign. “Being a political science major has given me an inside perspective. This is a non-partisan issue affecting both sides and our communities,” Freeman says, “This is about fair voting and representation—everyone deserves that.”
Freeman says Student Government will most likely host another table with Voters Not Politicians sometime in November. Voters Not Politicians must collect 315,654 signatures by February 2018 for the proposal to make the November election. To learn more about Voter Not Politicians, visit votersnotpoliticians.com.
From A Chinese Apartment To Wall Street Darling: The Rise Of Alibaba
Enlarge this image toggle caption Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images
Like most great origin stories, the tale behind China's e-commerce giant, Alibaba, begins simply. In the winter of 1999, Jack Ma, a former English teacher, gathered friends in an apartment in the eastern city of Hangzhou.
In a dark suit coat and white shirt, Ma laid out the challenges of trying to develop and dominate e-commerce at a time when only a few million people were actually on the Internet in China.
"Our competitors are not in China, but America's Silicon Valley," said Ma, in a scene captured in a recent documentary on the company, Crocodile in the Yangtze.
"Americans are strong at hardware and systems, but on information and software, Chinese brains are just as good as theirs," he said. "This is the reason we dare to compete with Americans."

Hundreds of billions of dollars in sales later, Alibaba kicked off a roadshow this week to drum up interest in an initial public stock offering in New York that it hopes will raise more than $20 billion in what is expected to be one of the biggest tech IPOs ever.
Porter Erisman, who worked as an Alibaba vice president and directed the documentary, says the key to the company's initial success was providing a crucial service to Chinese manufacturers, who made everything from ball bearings to cigarette lighters.
"The problem was they had a difficult time finding buyers," Erisman says during an interview in Shanghai. "They would have to go to trade shows in other countries or they would have to advertise in expensive magazines."
Ma built a business-to-business Internet platform that brought buyers and sellers together — and it took off.
Next, Ma created a business-to-consumer platform, a sort of Chinese eBay, where many mom-and-pop operations sold everything from clothing to cameras to cellphones. He named it Taobao, which means "searching for treasure" in Mandarin.
There was one problem. EBay had already invested in a Chinese e-commerce company called EachNet, which dominated the market.
"Our view is that one of the defining characteristics of winning e-commerce companies globally over the next five to 10 years will be how successful they are in China," eBay's then-CEO Meg Whitman said in an interview with CNBC.
EBay charged for use of its platform, but Ma focused on building customers — not revenue — and offered Taobao's services free.
In a telling scene from the movie, Erisman and Ma discuss a statement from eBay.
"EBay has already come back with a response, saying 'free' is not a business model," says Erisman, as they chat in Ma's office. "They are saying they are much stronger, because they can charge."
The trailer from a recent documentary on Alibaba, called Crocodile in the Yangtze. YouTube
"That's good," says Ma, hunched over a laptop. "The day when they disappear in China, they will regret ... what they said today."
By 2005, Taobao had passed eBay and had found a potential way to make real money. Ma had created Alipay, an escrow payment system like PayPal, which ensured the seller would only receive money once a product was delivered and, presumably, the customer was satisfied.
The system helped build trust in a country where it is in scarce supply in both social interactions and, especially, business. In the meantime, Alipay could hold the funds and earn a return off them.
Last year, Alipay said its record payment amount for a single day — just on its mobile platform — was nearly $2 billion.
"Alipay eventually turned out to be a very profitable part of the business," says Felix Oberholzer-Gee, who has co-authored case studies on Alibaba at Harvard Business School.
Alibaba's success turned Ma, a decidedly nonconformist CEO, into a household name and icon in China. In 2009, he presided over a rally with 16,000 employees in a stadium in Hangzhou. He rose from beneath the stage, wearing a leather jacket, faux mohawk, sunglasses and fake nose ring and belted out "Can You Feel the Love Tonight," from The Lion King, to a cascade of cheers.
But China's Internet landscape changes quickly and Alibaba faces new challenges today. In addition to its other platforms, Alibaba runs Tmall, an Amazon-like site, where brand-name companies sell through virtual stores.
Jeongwen Chiang, a professor of marketing at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says some companies now find operating on Tmall — which charges for placement — too expensive and too crowded.
"Some of the people who do business with Alibaba start to have a second thought about does it make sense to go into this gigantic cyberspace," says Chiang, "and get buried under hundreds and hundreds of merchants."
Competitors are also teaming up to grab Tmall's sales.
Another Internet retailer of brand-name products, JD.com, has joined with a wildly popular messaging app, WeChat, in hopes of taking a big chunk of the growing mobile e-commerce market.
"I think this is going to be a big challenge for Alibaba, because Alibaba doesn't have any meaningful social platform," says Chiang.
Alibaba is still China's undisputed e-commerce champ, but to maintain its lead, it's going to have to work harder and harder.

Every fake war requires a parade of fake experts to help shill for military intervention. Elizabeth O'Bagy is a prime example of one such operative. Beyond her fake credentials however, the story leads right to the heart of who is really pulling Washington's strings on Syria.
ELIZABETH O'BAGY: Creating journalism to fit Washington policy.
“Dr” Elizabeth O'Bagy, a Georgetown University alumna, was thrust into the national conversation this past week after she wrote an op-ed piece for Rupert Murdoch's The Wall Street Journal, an article which was later cited by both US Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen. John McCain, R-AZ, in their case for a military strike in Syria.
The only problem was that O'Bagy, a “senior research analyst” at Washington's heavily pro-Israeli and neoconservative think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), allegedly landed her job by claiming she had received her doctorate from Georgetown University. She has since been sacked from her role at the think tank.
She will forever be known as Kerry and McCain's own sexier version of “curve ball” for Syria.
Here McCain is caught leaning on the fake PhD making his distorted case for war in Syria…
.
Specifically, Kerry sought to support Washington's own shaky policy thesis by reading a quote from the op-ed in which O'Bagy wrote that Islamic extremist factions are not “spearheading the fight against the Syrian government,” but rather that the struggle is being led by “moderate opposition forces”. Watch…
.
Through the pro-war Murdoch press, O'Bagy simply delivered the very contrived thesis which Kerry, McCain and Obama were looking for, in order to justify their own sales pitch for intervention and for sending arms to a ‘democracy-loving, moderate rebel army in Syria'.
Even more interesting is who O'Bagy has been working for. The ISW think tank was founded by Kimberly Kagan, a devout neocon, whose fellow experts elevate U.S. military intervention, and provide policy research back-up for U.S. State Department, CIA, AIPAC and large national security defense contractors. The ISW's board of directors is led by William Kristol. This type of organisation is a nexus which brings together, among other things, support for the Syrian opposition, anti-Castro in Cuba, and pro-Israeli activities.
Shocking enough, but then you discover that O'Bagy is also policy director at an even more questionable Washington DC outfit – a pro-rebel, money-raising and policy promoting nonprofit organisation known as the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF). Exactly how much money SETF has collected to date (or where it has been spent) is unknown, but following the O'Bagy incident, O'Bagy and the group's Communications Director Cassie Chesley – have both been pulled down from the SETF website. According to the SETF, Syrian opposition agents have been coordinating with operatives in Washington through “field work” since November 2012, including building a parallel government structures inside rebel-held areas in Syria:
“In November 2012, SETF opened a field office, which serves as a headquarters for Syrian activists on the ground, a central training location for opposition members, a working base for transitional justice and civil society groups to collect forensic evidence and testimonials of war crimes, and is a coordinating location for aid into the country. Syrian activist, Razan Shalab Alsham serves as our office manager.
In the liberated areas in the north of Syria, civilians are finding ways to develop grassroots civilian democratic structures to provide rule of law, basic services such as trash collection, civilian police force, and utilities. These (Civilian Administrative Councils) CACs are being created out of necessity, but they are also the seeds of proto-democratic structures that the Syrian people themselves developed without international help. Defying conventional wisdom, the authority of the CACs is respected by the armed opposition, because they are providing social services and a structure that encourages stability for the families of the men currently fighting the regime. It is important that the funding mechanism being employed helps to further unite the opposition and mitigates financial competition from occurring. Support of CACs helps to stabilize liberated areas and provide civilian oversight and authority.”
It's obvious to see what O'Bagy's Syrian Emergency Task Force actually is – an essential “Field Office” and resource for regime change agents in Washington, as well as a source of intelligence collection for the CIA. It would be naive to think that anyone work with such a nation-building “field office” would be anything else. Putting this into context of recent revelations that while the US and its allies have been acting out US war plan in Syria, the CIA has been quietly delivering lethal arms to their rebels in Syria, the so-called ‘field offices' of seemingly innocuous nonprofit NGO's like Syrian Emergency Task Force, would be a key link in the chain which Washington uses to interface with their militants inside Syria.
CIA Journalists and Information Campaigns
In the case of O'Bagy, the fact that Georgetown University is a well-known, rather fertile recruiting ground for the CIA, could give another clue as to who she is working with, or working for. You can never know for sure, but she certainly would be a prize recruit for any intelligence or informational operation. Here we have a smart young super model-type, who can do the talking head role, appearing regularly on CNN, FOX, NPR, al Jazeera (Qatar state media) and other networks, as the so-called expert on Syria's rebel factions. She has also stated on air, “I travel with groups (in Syria) where we actually can kind of identify the more extremist checkpoints”.
So… behind enemy lines, in an undeclared war, O'Bagy is certainly escorted by either US special forces, or ex-special forces who are being paid roughly $1,500 per day to ferry around embedded journalists within a hermetically sealed CIA and US taxpayer-funded envelope. The only reason for this kind of arrangement constructed through the CIA, would be for these pro-rebel “experts” and western journalists to formulate politicised ‘intelligence' so men like John McCain and John Kerry – and President Obama, can make their case for sending arms to insurgents, or even to shill for western military intervention. Which is exactly what we see in the case of “Dr” Elizabeth O'Bagy.
In addition, Elizabeth O'Bagy was drafted in to help defend the alleged CIA American al Qaeda fighter recently detained by the FBI for working with al Qaeda in Syria, by working to shift opinion over his jihadist affiliations. FOX News reported:
“O'Bagy was fired earlier this week by the Institute for the Study of War for allegedly lying about her academic credentials. Her writings had been used by U.S. officials to bolster their case for military action against the Assad regime.
O'Bagy discussed the rebel group in question in a June 19, 2013 signed affidavit filed in the case of American Eric Harroun, who was indicted for fighting alongside the terror group al-Nusra in Syria.O'Bagy's signed declaration, which included a breakdown of rebel groups and their varying degrees of affiliation to Al Qaeda-linked terrorists, was used by Harroun's defense to argue that the former Army medic had actually fought with a splinter group and not a terrorist one – a group tied to the one O'Bagy described.It actually turns out that “Dr” O'Bagy's rigorous study of militant group's Facebook page (this is what passes for intelligence in 2013 – Facebook pages) forgot to mention images of the U.S. Capitol building on fire, with extremist fighters depicted, as well as al Qaeda-style, black and white flags in other images.“
US OPERATIVE: Jihadist-linked American fighter Eric Harroun poses for a photo with Islamic mercenary in Syria (photo above).
Was the American al Nusra fighter Eric Harroun working on a mercenary contract, paid by either the US, Saudi Arabia, or Qatar, or was he simply a CIA agent? One of the above is likely when considered alongside many other reports already existing on private contractors and special forces working inside Syria. According to his father, Darryl Harroun, his son was an American ‘patriot' who would never get involved with al-Qaeda, and claims he was gathering intelligence for the US inside Syria:
“I know he was doing some work for the CIA over there,” the man's father said. “I know for a fact that he was passing information onto the CIA.” See his interview below…
.
Aside from O'Bagy's position at Kagan's Institute for the Study of War, it's even more interesting to note that one of her mentors is none other than Michael Weiss, pro-Israel advocate and Communications & Research Director for the British-based Henry Jackson Society, a key Israeli and neoconservative foreign policy think tank.
To better understand who is really pulling Washington's strings regarding military intervention in Syria, one only has to read the joint article written by Michael Weis and Elizabeth O'Bagy, published in The Atlantic on June 14,2013, entitled:
“Why Arming the Rebels Isn't Enough: We need to dismantle Assad's air capability to really give the opposition a leg up.”
When you combine their own analysis in this article along with who is paying for their foreign policy advocacy careers, it's fairly easy to see what Israel's motivation is in Syria: using the US to destroy Syria's airforce and air defenses, leaving Israel as the sole military power in the region. Together, O'Bagy and Weis reveal the agenda here:
“Any swift and decisive decision to materially aid the Free Syrian Army will necessarily include degrading or destroying the runways and infrastructure of Syria's military airbases and commercial airports.”
Follow the money trail behind policy hacks like O'Bagy, and you will eventually learn who is ultimately pulling Obama's chain towards Syria.
The O'Bagy is also symptomatic of the amateur hour America has come to know as the Obama administration. It's embarrassing to see heads of state relying on a fraudulent expert, yet, it's appropriate to mention here that President Obama himself went so far as to seal and protect his own academic records and qualifications from public view. Executive Order 13489, banning the release of his records, was the first thing Obama did when he arrived in office in 2009.
It should be no surprise that absolutely nothing about Washington, London and Paris's dirty clandestine war effort in Syria is transparent, and the public know it. How long until our own political operators in the west are brought to book for their deception?

Syrian Writer Elizabeth O'Bagy Fired After Kerry And McCain Cite Her Work
Inquisitr
Syrian analyst writer Elizabeth O'Bagy has lost her job after she was quoted by Secretary of State John Kerry and Senator John McCain.
Both politicians quoted an op-ed O'Bagy wrote for the Wall Street Journal. O'Bagy, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, received her job after telling her bosses that she had received her doctorate from Georgetown University.
In a statement released on Wednesday, the institute writes:
“The Institute for the Study of War has learned and confirmed that, contrary to her representations, Ms. Elizabeth O'Bagy does not in fact have a Ph.D. degree from Georgetown University. ISW has accordingly terminated Ms. O'Bagy's employment, effective immediately.”
Elizabeth O'Bagy had worked for the institute for the last year and spent her first few months as an intern. She excelled as a researcher for the institute and moved through the ranks quickly. The piece quoted by John Kerry and John McCain was titled “On the Front Lines of Syria's Civil War.”
In the piece, Elizabeth O'Bagy wrote about how extremists and moderates exercise control over distinct areas of the country and how checkpoints are often set up to define territory. O'Bagy also wrote about distinct areas where moderate rebels are in control and can keep weapons out of the hands of extremists.
O'Bagy was originally listed as a “senior analyst” at the institute, and later her affiliation with the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a non-profit organization based in Washington, was revealed. On Twitter, O'Bagy said she never attempted to conceal her ties with opposition and rebel commanders. She also noted that she was “never paid” to advocate her views on Syria.
On September 7, O'Bagy tweeted: “I'm not trying to trick America here.”
At this time, it is not known if O'Bagy still holds her original position with SETF.

Former NFL executive Bill Polian was brought onto SportsCenter this morning to give some insight into the NFL's bungling of the Ray Rice situation. He was specifically asked if he, as someone who has worked in the NFL office, thought it was possible for an NFL executive to have obtained a copy of the tape showing Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancée in an elevator, as was reported by the AP yesterday, and not have shown that tape to Roger Goodell or any other NFL execs.
The video above is Polian's answer to that question, which aired on SportsCenter at 10:47 a.m. Here is a transcription of what he said:
It is very puzzling to me. As a matter of fact, I worked as a vice president in the NFL office in 1993, with respect to football operations. I know how the office works, I've physically been there—it was a different building, not the one they're in now—but it's very difficult for me to understand how that could happen. Especially when you're in a situation that is as high-profile as that particular incident is. It's puzzling, and I have as many questions as everyone else. It's outside my area of expertise. For all the years that I was in the NFL, NFL security, and the NFL's ability to protect its integrity, the so-called "protection of the shield," was unmatched in American business. Forget about sports—in American business. I mean, you did not step out of line in the NFL, and if you did, there was an unwritten rule that when you were called into the office—and met with someone who was the commissioner or there at the behest of the commissioner—that you better come clean, that you better tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And if you work in the office, you better be on top of the details. The office was there to make sure that the clubs, the players, the reputation of the NFL reamined unsullied. That goes back to the 1960's with the administration of Pete Rozelle. So this is totally, totally out of character for what I know of the NFL office.

That segment ended up getting cut short, perhaps due to a technical mishap, and so Polian was brought back on the air at 11:08 a.m., at which point he was asked the exact same question by Chris McKendry.
And here is a transcription:
Well it can happen. It's a very large organization, much larger than when I served in the league office, maybe much larger by a factor of 10. When you have a large, bureaucratic organization, which that is, and there are some that think it is too large, very honestly. Things can slip through the cracks. Someone can make a value judgement who has no right to make that judgement. The CEO, who is in effect Roger Goodell, doesn't get all the information he needs all the time. That's a fact of life in bureaucracies. In this case, we'll find out what happened, and they'll absolutely, they being the NFL and Roger, will have to take steps to make sure it never happens again.

So, what the hell happened here? In the first segment, Polian makes the NFL out to be the East German Stasi, where a low-level executive wouldn't dare hide pertinent information from his or her superiors for fear of swift and merciless retribution. But then here comes Polian 20 minutes later, describing the NFL offices as a run-of-the-mill bureaucracy where of course vital pieces of information could fall through the cracks.
Bill Polian either has a hard time maintaining consistent opinions for longer than 20 minutes at a time, or something spooked him into softening his answer during that second go-round. If we assume the first answer to be the truest one, you can probably guess what that something might have been.

Big h/t to reader Matt
One of the most talked about things this week was a strange video of a man who appeared to have a real life jet-powered hoverboard. The video was published by Zapata Racing, which has made water-powered versions of these flying machines for a few years now. The difference is that those are always tethered to some kind of personal watercraft. This new "Flyboard Air," as CEO Franky Zapata calls it, is something totally different.
The video went viral on Monday, and it polarized the internet. People thought it was either the coolest thing ever invented, or that it was a massive hoax. Even optimistic parties, like myself, were skeptical. Maybe we all still feel a little burned by Tony Hawk and FunnyorDie, or maybe we were just being careful — after all, the video was suspiciously edited, there were very few details, and it just looked a little fake.
Over the week, more videos of the flight(s) surfaced, and it appeared to be the real deal. This morning, though, Franky Zapata himself called me up to talk a little bit more about the Flyboard Air, how it works, and what he wants to do with it.
Sean O'Kane: So there are three parts to this, right? The board, a fuel tank, and a remote?
Franky Zapata: Yes, the thing I have on my back is like a Camelbak but it's full of kerosene. Jet A1.
What kind of controls are on the remote?
That's just throttle for the four turboengines on the board. Two more are on the sides for stabilization.
When did this project even begin?
We've been working on it for four years. We tried to figure it out that by using the original Flyboard and just pushing air inside the hose. After that, we took two years to create the great turboreactors, and to create the algorithms to stabilize the Flyboard.
Six engines, a logic board, and a backpack full of kerosene
When did you make the first flight?
The first working flight? It was just a month ago. And then when we were about to fly again we did a video, and we put that on YouTube. So it's really new. It's extremely new.
Can you tell me more about how it works? How many engines are in there?
We have four engines inside, and the power is 250 horsepower each. It's about 1,000 horsepower total.
How do you keep it stabilized? Is there something helping you other than you just shifting your weight?
It's a logic system inside the board that helps stabilize the machine. It's extremely hard to stabilize, so yes it's not only my balance. For example, we use like the same kind of electronics like you use on a drone to stabilize. The problem is to create the algorithms, the right algorithms, to combine the intelligence in the board and in your brain. So we spent about four months to make that work.
What are those algorithms controlling to help stabilize, is it just thrust level?
No. We adjust the top speed of the small turbines on the side, and also the inclination of the turboreactors itself. So it's like we have six systems working together plus my brain and my legs.
So it will actually change the angle of those turbines?
Yes, it changes the angle of the turbines, it changes the angle of the thrust nozzle, we adjust also the power for each engine, and also we adjust the thrust of the side turbines, the small ones.
(Zapata Racing)
Would anybody be able to ride this without any Flyboard experience?
Oh, no. It's impossible to ride it before you have a minimum of 50 or 100 hours in the original Flyboard with water. Also, if you want to try it, you must have seven lives, like the cat. [Laughs]
Did you test it over water as a safety precaution?
Yeah, we used water for the safety. Honestly, the whole system should be able to land if you have one turboreactor fail. So I'm able to stabilize it even if I lost one engine and we had enough thrust to get down and land. If one turboreactor fails it's fine, because we have four turboreactors, and we can fly with three. And inside the remote we have three different Wi-Fi channels, plus we have three sensors. Everything is threefold, and they speak together, so in case one fails, the two also know which one failed, you know? So that's the reason why we decided to fly for a few months over the water, but we are almost ready to fly above the ground in the next few months.
It's impossible to ride it before you have a minimum of 50 or 100 hours in the original Flyboard with water
What happens if you do wind up in the water?
Nothing really serious, there's no danger for me, because I fell in the water honestly three days ago. [Laughs] Three days ago I crashed in the water because we tried to — you know we're going to do the hoverboard the farthest trip. The last one was 275 meters, and we will break it by 10 times longer. We will do about 2 miles. We will cross 2 miles with the Flyboard Air at about 60 to 80 kilometers per hour. And we were training for that, and the last time trained we trained with 80 kilometers per hour wind. And we didn't realize that when we have wind we go through more battery for the stabilization system. So just five seconds before I landed on the platform, I go out of battery. And the machine starts to turn like a torpedo, like if you lost the small rotor on a helicopter. I started to turn like [Franky makes a noise, "Shooooh!"], and I had no choice but to kill the engine just before I landed in the water. I broke all the electronics on the board, so it will cost me money, but the rest of it is fine.
Is this the only version right now?
We have just the one machine, because it's just been working for four weeks. So now we are prepared to build another one, just for the media attention, because honestly we didn't know that the media would be so excited about the project. At the beginning we just did it just to show people what we can do, and just to show our patience and what we achieved. But we didn't realize that everyone wants to see the Flyboard Air for real, so now it's not just something for us.
At the same time, we've finished the research and development on a new project that will use the same kind of board and the same kind of technology for the stabilization, but it will be much easier for the general public, and also certainly for the army, or for security, so we have something for this. We can use the technology to maybe change the way that people travel, hopefully.
The next one "will be something that everybody can ride"
What would be the biggest differences between this version and that one?
It would be something you can sit on it, something easier, I cannot talk to much about it because patents were not filed yet, but it will be something that everybody can ride. At the moment the Flyboard Air is something like, if you want to ride it, you have to spend 100 hours on a water Flyboard, plus you have to learn how to use it for another 20 hours, and you can still make a mistake and fall. So the goal for the other one is to have something extremely small, extremely stable, and something that you can take to go and buy your bread in the morning.
So what's the plan for the current version then?
Honestly? I don't know. [Laughs] You know when you decide to have a child, you decide to have a child because you want it. You don't decide to have a child because it will become a surgeon, or a lawyer. For us it was the same thing, when we decide to create something, we create it, and after we just follow what ways the project can go.
Today, we know that people are really interested in it. For me, today it's a dream because I really realized my dream to fly. And we are receiving attention from crazy companies, maybe even to put it in production. A week ago it was just for me, you know? Today, for sure, we will be able to use this technology to help the new project. But if everybody wants it, if everybody wants a Flyboard Air, we have to work with the government, we have to work with liability, we have to work on a thousand things. But why not?
I was skeptical when I first saw it because of the way the video was edited, and because it's just a very unbelievable thing to look at. What was your reaction to the people calling "fake"?
I said that we achieved our goal. [Laughs] Because it's exactly what we tried to do. We covered every mechanical aspect. The plan when we decided to create the Flyboard Air, it was crazy hard because we wanted to make something extremely small, something that looks like a skateboard and not like a helicopter. It would be easy to build something that was like 2 meters and able to fly, it would be easy to do that. But our goal was to make something so small that people would believe it's a fake, or it's just an animation. And so when people said that, honestly, we are happy about that. We achieved our goal. Because when people see it in person, they will go crazy. That's cool.
"My goal is to ride in the clouds."
Zapata Racing is already teasing more footage is coming, what will you be releasing?
We plan to release footage about every month. Then in 16 days we will break the world record when we cross 3 miles on the French coast from one city to another city, and we will land in the middle of the city in front of the public. And after that, we have crazy things. You won't believe it. [Laughs] We will fly the clouds. My goal is to ride the clouds. Do like snowboarding in the powder, but I want to do it in a cloud. That's my dream, and I will do my best to realize that.
Is there a safety system for these crazier flights, like a parachute or something?
Yeah, before going high in the sky we will use a parachute. But over the water, I have already fallen many times at over 85, 90 kilometers per hour when doing my testing. So I know you can fall at about that speed without too much injury. The machine is capable of going 90 to 100 miles per hour, but in my tests with my ability I didn't pass over 55 miles per hour. That's the maximum speed I reached three days ago. I think before the end of the summer I will be able to reach 80 miles per hour.

Vancouver is famous for inventing many things—the California roll, Douglas Coupland, botox—but taking credit for hip-hop seems a bit of a stretch.
Nevertheless, stepping forward in the category of "things you would never guess", comes this extraordinary revelation: hip hop was invented in Vancouver. For real.
Don't believe us? Check out music documentary "Sample This", which traces the origins of the most influential music form of the late 20th century back to Can-Base studios (which became Mushroom Studios) on Vancouver's west side.
That's where, in 1973, the most sampled tracks in hip-hop history were laid, as part of the Incredible Bongo Band album, "Bongo Rock". First seized upon by Bronx DJ Kool Herc, the percussion breaks in "Apache" are now cemented as the bedrock of the genre.
As The Roots' Questlove puts it: "Not everything cool came from Detroit or Muscle Shoals. This came from Vancouver, Canada."
The film's director, Dan Forrer (who will introduce the movie in Vancouver on Monday), told the Georgia Straight that audiences are generally surprised to see a grey-haired white man step onto the stage following a screening.
"Everybody figured the film was made by a 36-year-old black guy."

If you're like me and have been avoiding work like the plague during afternoon World Cup matches, you saw the Germans beat Brazil like a drum yesterday. I'm always highly entertained when Twitter erupts at the expense of a losing team, and yesterday didn't disappoint. Yellow Jacket Nation trolled the host country hard, comparing the ass-kicking to Tech's 222-0 triumph over Cumberland College in 1916. After the jump, I'll give you some of the best from Twitter and provide my thoughts on the biggest beat-down in college football history.
With the score at 5-0 in the first half, Tech Assistant AD Dean Buchan's math skills showed just how impressive Tech's blowout was:
Germany needs to score 217 more goals to tie #GaTech's win over Cumberland in 1916. — Dean Buchan (@DeanBuchan) July 8, 2014
As the onslaught continued, the Twitterverse was flooded by more of the same:
At this rate, 222-0 over Cumberland is in jeopardy. — Mike DeGeorge (@MikeDeGeorge) July 8, 2014
Don't think there is any way Cumberland can come back against Germany today — Keith Niebuhr (@Keith247Sports) July 8, 2014
It is official. Germany is to Brazil as Tech is to Cumberland. #WorldCup2014 #GERvsBRA — Tonia Wood (@WoodTonia) July 8, 2014
Finally, Brazil scored in the 90th minute, and @sportsbroad reminded us that this wouldn't fly on the Flats:
John Heisman never would've let that happen. RT @PaulMyerberg: This is like Cumberland kicking a late field goal to make it 222-3. — sportsbroad (@sportsbroad) July 8, 2014
Watching Brazil play Jay-Z to Germany's Solange reminded Tech fans of the single most badass claim that we can make as Yellow Jackets. We own the most lopsided victory in college football history, a record that will not likely be broken in our lifetime. As dominant as Ze Germans were yesterday, their performance doesn't hold a candle to our 222 point thrashing of Cumberland. Sure, the game was almost 100 years ago against a team that discontinued its football program before the season, but that doesn't diminish our privilege as Tech fans to boastfully claim that no other team in history has laid a smackdown quite like our alma mater. So next time you're forced to defend our five straight losses to Georgia by bragging to a Bulldwag fan, “We have more national championships than you” and “Calvin broke the Madden curse,” don't forget to mention that Georgia Tech holds the baddest record in the books.

Explanation: A close series of consecutive exposures are combined in this intriguing composite of the Full Moon slowly crawling, across the sky. Beginning on the upper right at 19:42 UT and ending at 22:14 UT on April 25, the sequence follows the Moon from Germany as it passes through Earth's shadow in a partial lunar eclipse. Near the top, the Moon just grazes the southern edge of Earth's dark central shadow, or umbra. But the decreased brightness in the darker part of the outer shadow region, the penumbra, is also apparent on the lunar disk. In fact, the relative size and shape of the Earth's shadow regions and the Moon are easier to see along the segments of this lunar caterpillar. Nearly impossible to follow with the eye though, a penumbral lunar eclipse, the Full Moon passing only through the pale outer penumbral shadow, will begin on May 25.

When I was a young designer, I always asked other people how they got noticed for their work. The answer I most consistently received was “do good work.” Now, when people ask me the same question, I respond with the same answer. Good work always speaks for itself. It's a self-promoting robot.
If you work in an agency or web department within an organization, let's shift that perspective from promoting your work to being considered for a promotion. Doing good work is a smaller part of the equation. My experience has demonstrated that most of the great opportunities go to people with magical attitudes. Maintaining a great attitude is far from automatic. It takes real skill to keep it positive.
While we largely deal in a world of computer interactions, it's the personal interactions you have with your colleagues, peers, and managers that truly shape your destiny. The amazing grid structure you implemented, the engaging presentation you gave, or the sleek JavaScript you wrote won't stick in people's minds as much as the time you praised someone for an amazing effort or (gasp) threw someone under the bus to make yourself shine.
For better or worse, I've been in the position to influence the professional growth and development of many talented people. My experience is that people who achieve the most success share one or more of these qualities, in no particular order:
They are humble. Their success doesn't consume them.
They are on time. On time for work, on time for meetings, on time for the train. They hate wasting their own time, and as a byproduct, anyone else's.
They always appreciate what they have. And as a result, they usually get more.
They are universally respectful—to their friends, their boss, or to the person that makes their sandwich for lunch.
They don't let work consume them.
They make sacrifices for the benefit of others.
They are patient.
They put in the extra effort when it's needed, without any strings attached.
They resolve issues or conflicts directly.
They respectfully push back. It's easy to push back. To do so with respect takes skill.
They trust their colleagues.
The truth is, I have hired people based on their attitudes alone, and it's rarely been a bad move. People who have positive attitudes want to learn. People with great technical skills and lousy attitudes may find themselves combing through LinkedIn before they know it.
You know those passionate locker room speeches by sports coaches pounding the importance of winning attitudes in the heads of athletes? Yep, heard them a million times. But they're not doing it to create drama. They're doing it because they've learned firsthand what contributes to success.
I, for one, plan on making 2013 the year I take a step back and look at how my attitude is absorbed and affects the others around me. And I'll adjust accordingly. And if you consider doing the same, you might be surprised by the doors that open for you.

9/11 families' fury after two British students WIN fancy dress competition wearing TWIN TOWERS outfits (and one of them is daughter of pilot who flew in US on day of terror attacks)
Amber Langford and Annie Collinge, 19, dressed as World Trade Center
Costumes showed blazing towers and victims jumping from windows
They won a £150 prize for 'best dressed' at Halloween club night in Chester
Miss Langford's father Martin was a pilot who used to work in America
Mother of British 9/11 victim says: 'It's hard to understand'
Two female students have outraged the families of 9/11 victims by entering a nightclub fancy dress competition dressed as the Twin Towers being hit by planes.
Amber Langford and Annie Collinge, both 19, won the contest and a £150 prize at a Chester nightclub despite lampooning the worst terrorist attack in modern history.
Today, families of those who lost loved ones in the New York terror attack said that they found the costumes distressing.
Patricia Bingley, 79, whose 43-year-old son Kevin Dennis died in the atrocity said: 'It's hard to understand where they've come from to do this.'
Mr Dennis was working as a bond trader on the 101st floor of the North Tower when a plane struck the skyscraper on September 11, 2001.
Fury: Amber Langford, left, and Annie Collinge, right, won a fancy dress contest dressed as the Twin Towers Stunt: Amber Langford and Annie Collinge during the party at Rosies nightclub on October 31 Their actions have also enraged Miss Langford's father Martin, a pilot who was working in the US for United Express on the day Al Qaeda brought down the World Trade Center and killed 2,996 people, including 67 Britons.
'I didn't know anything about it, but I'm not happy at all,' the retired pilot, who now lives in Anglesey, told The Sun.
'She knows I'm a pilot and that's not cool at all. We will be having a little chat, I think.'
Miss Langford, who is studying biology at the University of Chester, and Miss Collinge, a criminology student, wore the outfits to a Halloween event at Rosies nightclub last Thursday evening.
Tasteless: Annie Collinge took this picture of herself as she was getting ready for the party
They had modelled their costumes on the North and South Tower wreathed in flames and with victims jumping from windows. Both women also wore hats topped with the wreckage of the planes and U.S. flags.
The widow of a 9/11 victim living near Chester said she was 'angry and disgusted' at the girls' outfit and suggested that they were ignorant about the true horror of the terror attack.
Liz Gilligan, whose husband Ron was working in the World Trade Center at the time of the atrocity, told the Chester Chronicle: 'I can't begin to tell you how angry and disgusted I am.
'These girls and Rosie's need to be made aware that 9/11 was very real and while it was 3,000 miles away, it affected people on their doorstep.'
Some clubbers were so disgusted that they tried to complain to management.
'I was completely outraged,' said 20-year-old George Borsberry. 'Not only were they labelled the "best dressed", but they were also given £150 to dress up in this way and mock the victims and the families of the victims.
'We asked to see the manager to complain and was turned down due to him being "too busy" to see us.
'After waiting two and a half hours to see the person who decided this dreadful winner all we got was, "Sorry but it was a good costume."
'He then had the audacity to say there were people in other disgusting costumes such as Jimmy Savile, as if to justify that it was alright to dress like that.'
Others took to the club's Facebook page to vent their anger about the decision to give the teenagers a prize for their outfits.
Ashley Goodall wrote: 'That's not even Halloween that's just a very bad joke, not like you'd walk around America like that.'
Millie Robinson tweeted: 'Can not actually believe that some people went as the Twin Towers blowing up on Halloween.'
Outrage: Relatives of 9/11 victims have spoken of their anger at seeing the teenagers' costumes
"Blood for the blood god!" (felt appropriate)
Anyhow the idea of this deck is quite simple. What i am trying to do, is to make a control aggro combo in R/B. The reason i went with R/B is simplye because of, Desecration Demon, Slaughter Games, creature removal and Mogis, God of Slaughter .
In the early game, the plan is to get down Rakdos Cackler, Rakdos Shred-Freak and Spike Jester as fast as possible. to get in some early damage. When i hit the 4 mana mark, then the fatties are supposed to drop, such as Rakdos, Lord of Riots, Desecration Demon and Mogis, God of Slaughter , and just continue the beating.
To make sure i get through, i am packing a bunch of control. Slaughter games to take out cards such as Anger of the Gods and Supreme Verdict or other nasties that can get in my way.Creature removal to take out the opponents fatties to simply keep going.What i see happening is that the deck could lose out to some weenie decks, simlye because they are able to trade with my creatures, and can pretty much lock down mogis and desecration demon.
If you have any suggestions and/or critique for my deck, please do leave a comment.
How's everyone doing lately? I was supposed to come home later this week for the holiday but my grandpa isn't doing so great, so I changed my flight and came home earlier. It's nice to have a few extra days to spend with family. I'm really looking forward to food and family the rest of the week.
Today I have a fun look using two polishes from Daphine Polish. I recently was lucky enough to meet Joanne the maker, since these polishes come from NYC. She is super sweet and I couldn't wait to try these polishes out.
This is The Beast, a dark maroon holographic polish filled with gold sparkles. The holographic effect is subtle in this polish, but I really love it.
I then sponged on Castiel to the tips. It is a glitter polish that has brown, gold, purple, and red glitters in it. I'm in love with this. It looks gorgeous as a glitter topper, but I concentrated it more at the tips for a good contrast between it and The Beast.
The look reminded me of fall, so I decided to paint some fallen leaves on my nails. I used all acrylic paints to paint on the leaves.
Woo! We made it, I know that was a picture heavy post, but those polishes are just so pretty, I had to show you all the pictures. What do you think of the leaves?
Enjoy & until next time, Amy Lee

As the polls stand today the biggest question of the 2012 election is: (a) what happens in the House of Representatives? And (b) is it possible, after billions of dollars in ads and two years of gridlock in Washington, that everything will essentially be the same?
Without a change in the election, President Obama is poised to win reelection with over 300 Electoral Votes and Democrats appear set to hold a minimum of 53 seats in the Senate, with the potential to raise that number to around 55.
So it is unlikely that there will be changes in the White House or the Senate.
While both Democrats and Republicans will contest these statewide elections with campaign funds and outside money the last issue at hand seems to be who will be the Speaker of the House?
Will November 7 look more like 2008 with Obama, Reid and Pelosi in charge or like 2010 with Obama, Reid and Boehner in charge?
The Battle for the House has been the least covered but may turn out to be the most dramatic, with a hand full of districts determining the balance of power in Washington and the direction of the country.
Wednesday's presidential debate will play a big role in how October plays out politically.
If Mitt Romney is unable to completely reset the debate then Republicans have two choices: focus on the House or play from behind with Romney and the Senate.
There will be a tremendous amount of pressure for outside groups to focus their money on creating a firewall for John Boehner, Eric Cantor and the Tea Party House by the end of the week if Romney is not able to turn the tables Wednesday.
For as much as Democrats have tipped the electoral map in their favor, a concentration of resources by Republicans on the House will be difficult to overcome if, and only if, Republicans quickly abandon Romney and expensive Senate seats.
Should it be too politically difficult for Republicans to cut and run to a defensive position on the House then the last few weeks will likely see a House that is up for grabs. At that point any money advantage will be wiped out by the fact that there is so little time left on the clock.
Both parties will be able to go toe-to-toe in House districts for two or three weeks.
While the influence of outside groups is different, this election is shaping up in a way similar to the 1996 Clinton reelection where the outcome of the Presidential race and Senate control were pretty clear in early October.
Ultimately, Democrats were able to gain seats in the House but were not able to come close to winning it in 1996.
Given the Democratic losses in 2010 that allowed Republicans to control the redistricting process in a number of crucial states, it will be difficult for Democrats to win the House unless there is a big landslide for President Obama.
But the fact is right now Democrats have a stronger map for the House than Romney has for the White House. That is presenting a lot of difficult questions for Republican campaign committees, Rightwing outside groups and mega donors like Sheldon Adelson who have spent a lot of money on Republicans this election cycle.

Last week, a Northwestern University student rocked the campus by filing a federal lawsuit against the university for failing to take adequate action on her two-year-old complaint of sexual harassment against an NU professor.
The student, now a junior, alleges that the university discriminated and retaliated against her for making the harassment charge.
The faculty member she has implicated is Peter Ludlow, 57, a high-profile language theorist and cyberspace expert. (Ludlow figured prominently in a column I wrote about "hacktivist" Aaron Swartz last year.) Ludlow denies the student's claims, and says it was she who propositioned him. And that he declined.
The Reader, which does not identify victims of alleged sexual assault, is withholding the student's name.
Here's the version of events according to the lawsuit, filed February 10 by the student's attorney, Kevin O'Connor:
In the fall of her freshman year, the student took a course from Ludlow, Philosophy of Cyberspace. Her lawsuit notes that he utilized Second Life avatars in this class, and "would show videos of virtual characters having sex to the students during classes."
The next quarter she sent him an e-mail suggesting that he attend an arts event on February 10, 2012, at Columbia College. He asked her to come with him, and after the art show they went to a restaurant, where, over her protests that she was underage and "did not want to drink," he ordered a glass of wine for her, according to the lawsuit.
On their way to another exhibit the same evening, they stopped at a bar, where he ordered a beer for her, the lawsuit continues. She requested that he take her home; he refused, insisting that they "party together." At the exhibit, the lawsuit claims, he again refused to take her home. From there they went to a third event, a performance in a warehouse.
The lawsuit states that he then took her to his apartment, gave her more drinks, and asked about her sexual relationships. She said she wanted to leave; around midnight they went to another bar. She "was already very drunk," according to the lawsuit—and when he began to "rub her back and kiss her," she "was too intoxicated to put up any meaningful resistance."
The lawsuit states that her memory was fading "in and out" and that she recalls being in an elevator and going back to his apartment, with him groping her while she begged him to stop; then she recalls waking up at 4 AM. "Ludlow was in bed with her, and his arms were around her. She panicked and blacked out."
He took her back to Evanston "around noon," and told her that he was looking forward to seeing her again, according to the lawsuit. The next day, she told another professor about "the incident." The lawsuit alleges that she also "confronted" Ludlow, who "begged" her not to tell anyone, and said he could mentor her or "pay her money." Meanwhile, "a faculty member" informed Northwestern's director of sexual harassment prevention, Joan Slavin, who began an investigation.
Three days after the incident, on February 13, 2012, the student "was hospitalized after attempting to commit a suicide as a result of the stress and trauma of the events with Ludlow," according to the lawsuit. She was diagnosed with PTSD and released three days later, requiring ongoing psychiatric care.
Two months later, on April 11, 2012, Slavin sent the student an e-mail reporting that she'd completed her investigation. "Based on the totality of the evidence," the e-mail says, Ludlow "engaged in unwelcome and inappropriate sexual advances," and his conduct "violated the University's Policy on Sexual Harassment." Slavin said she would work with the dean's office on "implementing needed corrective and remedial actions," but that she wouldn't be able to provide details of any actions taken, owing to their "confidential personnel nature." She added that she'd "cautioned" Ludlow to keep the matter confidential, and requested that the student also do so.
On April 24, 2012, the lawsuit states, lawyers for the student sent Ludlow a letter asking that he pay "damages caused by his sexual assault." His lawyer responded with a denial and a threat to sue for defamation.
Meanwhile, according to the lawsuit, the student became so anxious about running into Ludlow on campus that she was unable to attend some classes. The situation also made her mother sick, the lawsuit claims; in March 2013 the student had to leave school because her mother had developed health problems "caused by extreme emotional distress she had experienced due to her daughter's incident with Ludlow" and its "subsequent mishandling" by Northwestern. When the student returned to school, she "could not handle the full-time course load."
The lawsuit claims that after Slavin's investigation, the university set up a committee, which determined that Ludlow should be fired. According to the lawsuit, the university "ignored its own committee's decision." Ludlow has continued to teach, while the student has continued to suffer "humiliation, mental and emotional anguish, anxiety, and distress."
In a statement issued February 12, O'Connor said his client "eventually" filed a police report, with the "encouragement (and accompaniment)" of NU political science professor Jacqueline Stevens. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that the report was filed in April 2013.
Last Thursday, Ludlow's attorney, Kristin Case, released a statement noting that Ludlow has "never been charged with any crime," and "is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit." According to Case, "Mr. Ludlow did not assault [the student] nor did he engage in any inappropriate conduct. We have corroborating evidence that [she] propositioned Mr. Ludlow. He refused her advances."
Case's statement adds that "We are in possession of communications which show that [the student] initiated friendly communications with Mr. Ludlow the day after and then again four and five days after the date on which she now alleges he assaulted her." (The communications, which the statement says include text messages, were not made available.)
Northwestern spokesman Storer "Bob" Rowley declined to comment on pending litigation but said by e-mail that "the University has policies and procedures in place to protect our students and to address any such reported concerns." In fact, Northwestern instituted a new policy prohibiting consensual romantic and/or sexual relations between faculty and undergraduates just last month.
Ludlow reportedly was about to leave Northwestern for the philosophy department at Rutgers University. Spokesman Greg Trevor says Rutgers is "looking into this matter thoroughly to fully evaluate his candidacy. This was not brought to our attention by either the candidate or his employer."
On Friday, Ludlow's attorney filed a lawsuit against Sun-Times Media, Fox Television Stations, and Cumulus Broadcasting, owner of WLS AM 890. Ludlow's lawsuit states the Evanston Review, which is owned by Sun-Times Media, published the headline "Student allegedly raped by professor suing Northwestern University"—and that the websites of Fox 32 News and WLS AM 890 later published versions of the story with the same headline, crediting Sun-Times Media. (Full disclosure: the Chicago Reader is owned by Sun-Times Media.)
According to Ludlow's lawsuit, "the student did not include any allegation in [her] Lawsuit that . . . Ludlow had raped her or even that the two had engaged in sexual intercourse." It goes on to claim that the use of the phrase "allegedly raped by [a] professor" is defamatory. The suit charges that Ludlow has suffered damage to his reputation, emotional distress, humiliation, and embarrassment, and seeks damages.
"This agreement is a brilliant next step in our longstanding partnership, enabling Google to supercharge their hardware business while ensuring continued innovation within our HTC smartphone and Vive virtual reality businesses," HTC co-founder and CEO Cher Wang said in a statement.
The rumor mill went into overdrive yesterday after HTC announced that trading of its shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange would be halted today pending a "major announcement." The company swiftly added that, to debunk sale rumors, that it did not "comment on market rumor or speculation."
By then, however, most everyone had assumed that the long-standing flirtation between the two companies would finally finish. Unsubstantiated reports on Twitter claimed that the deal would see HTC's manufacturing division become a part of the search engine, but the reality is that half of its R&D division will be joining Google instead. According to Google SVP of Hardware Rick Osterloh, the two parties have yet to set a new work location for these employees, but they will aim to bring minimal disruption to them. The remaining R&D team will focus on HTC's own smartphone brand as well as VR technology.
In return, Google "will continue to have access to HTC's IP to support the Pixel smartphone family," according to HTC's statement. Or in Osterloh's own words, it's "continuing our big bet on hardware," which is fitting given his involvement with Google's short-lived ownership of Motorola's smartphone business.
Much like the deal that cleaved Nokia's hardware business from its parent company, the HTC name and brand will live on but in both the smartphone and VR worlds.

Tim Mack says he's serious about drinking Lake Michigan, all of it. We'll find out on Saturday. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Patty Wetli
THE SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN (FOR NOW) — Enjoy Lake Michigan while you can Chicagoans (and Michiganders, Hoosiers and Wisconsinites, come to think of it) because at 2:10 p.m. Saturday, it will be drained.
At least that's Tim Mack's plan, and he doesn't look like a liar.
The baby-faced 23-year-old with the kind of sweet smile grandmas fall in love with, insists that his goal to drink Lake Michigan on Saturday — not drink from Lake Michigan but drink the entire lake — is sincere.
"I figure I'll be the youngest to drink the lake," said Mack, who lives in Mt. Prospect and graduated from Loyola University. "Also the only."
Your choice here is to: A) consider the young man capable of going deeper into character than Joaquin Phoenix punking David Letterman or B) take Mack at face value.
Most of the 16,000 people following Mack's "I am going to drink Lake Michigan" Facebook page — yes, sixteen thousand — which he created Dec. 6, have opted for the latter.
Many have offered encouragement:
"I just saw the lake and said my goodbyes. I just want to tell you good luck. We're all counting on you," posted one fan.
Plenty have expressed logistical concerns — "Are you worried about having to drink Lake Huron too because they are connected?" — a factor Mack said he hadn't really considered.
"I guess I'm more of a dreamer than an analyst," he said.
Others shared environmental and digestive concerns:
"Please don't do this, we need the water." "I am looking forward to seeing the boats and bodies and stuff go down your esophagus."
Even more have offered to provide straws, or Brita filters.
"I'm going to go with a mug," said Mack, but filters would be welcome, particularly after his first exposure to lake water — part of his "training" — left him dizzy and a bit sick to his stomach.
"It is drinkable, but I do have weaned myself onto it," he said. "I want to discourage people from joining in; it could be dangerous if they haven't trained."
Here's how things will go down on Saturday:
Mack and his team will arrive at Montrose Avenue Beach, 4400 N. Lake Shore Drive, at 2 p.m. Shortly thereafter, the drinking will commence, with Mack setting a time limit of 10 minutes.
"I figured I would eyeball the lake after I'm done, look out and see whatever was under all that water," he said. "I guess I'll shake some hands and take a few pictures."
The idea came to him last New Year's Eve, he said, as he drove along Lake Shore Drive with friends. Before you ask, no, he wasn't drunk at the time.
"I'm not a big water drinker, this is something to push my own limits," he said.
Whether he succeeds in draining all of Lake Michigan, Mack said the attempt is important, if only to give people a whimsical break from the harsh realities of everyday life.
"I'm no hero," he said, "I'm just a man, drinking the lake."

“If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal”
This quote from early 20th century anarchist Emma Goldman has proliferated among modern left wing libertarians. The ideology of “voting doesn't matter, the parties are the same,” has been perceived as a facet of detached, slacking millennials, growing a resentment among mainstream US Democrats towards the radical left. This resentment can be exemplified by the debate over Nader vs Gore vs Bush.
The Economist, generally an economically conservative paper, attempted to find a reason:
One explanation favoured by older people is that the young are simply lazy. A better explanation may be that young people today do not feel they have much of a stake in society. Having children and owning property gives you a direct interest in how schools and hospitals are run, and whether parks and libraries are maintained. Yet perhaps the most depressing explanation is simply that in many places, young people do not feel that there is anyone worth voting for. A long-running European survey found that in 2008, 22% of French 15- to 24-year-olds said they believed society's problems could be fixed only by revolutionary action. In 1990 the equivalent figure was just 7%. When charismatic politicians do appear, they can win over the young: Barack Obama would not have been elected in 2008 and 2012 had it not been for remarkably high youth turnout in his favour. But for the most part, such politicians are few and far between. That might be because in most elections, a simpler strategy is to win over older people, who will vote however bad the candidates are. Young people—who tend to be more cosmopolitan, liberal and hopeful than their elders—tend to be switched off by the negativity and cynicism of election campaigns targeting the unhappy old. Sadly, cynicism then breeds cynicism.
Fresh off the second GOP presidential debate, we can see a clear difference between the GOP, with fascist attitudes toward disenfranchised groups, and Clinton's newly rebranded centrism. As one of those young anarchists and a potential 2016 voter, I must admit the difference between the two neoliberal parties is undeniable, but the legitimacy of our voting system is not. The better funded congressional candidate wins 91% of the time, and on average winning candidates outspent their opponents by 20:1. 60 individual donations have made up a third of 2016 campaign cash across all candidates, and half of money comes from donations above $100k—amounts only the ultra elite are giving.
This has real life effects on representation. Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens, a study from Stanford Professor Martin Gilens and Northwestern Professor Benjamin Page, declared the US an oligarchy, finding general public support has absolutely no sway on the likelihood of a bill passing.
Gilens and Page conclude:
The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy. Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance, such as regular elections, freedom of speech and association and a widespread (if still contested) franchise. But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful business organisations and a small number of affluent Americans, then America's claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened.
To put this in perspective, if every single American in the poorer 90% supported the funding of Planned Parenthood, but not a single member of the 1% did, Planned Parenthood would not get medicare funding. Some members of the establishment are even proud of this—conservative commentator Ann Coulter frequently expresses how she longs for an America without political rights for women.
Further showing a lack of coherent democracy, a candidate's media air time is perfectly correlated to their polling position. While it may not seem like intentional foul play, for many, these reports are where people first hear about candidates, creating a self-perpetuated, chicken or egg-like situation. From Fox News and CNN's 24 hour cycle to Bill Maher's weekly plead that the media stop talking about Trump (while devoting time to him), the only motive here is profit. Controversial candidates and their often prejudiced comments drove the record high ratings that CNN got during the second debate, and the following media coverage drove a shift in polls that skyrocketed Fiorina and sacked “Jeb!”.
Immediately after the debate, HP's illegal sales to Iranian customers under Fiorina's control and her fabricated statements on Planned Parenthood topped the news, headlines you'd expect would tarnish her politically, but instead they drove exposure and support. She became viewed as strong, with a presidential prowess. Ben Carson joined Trump at the top after declaring no Muslim could uphold the constitution as president, creating buzz for days. While his horribly offensive comments are what propelled him, Trump's coverage is finally waning from a lack of novelty, and so are his polling numbers. Ultimately, the ruthless maximization of profit and attention is the decider of representative elections. This sensationalist-demanding game leads perhaps the poorest people for the job to the top.
Our political system is designed to divert attention from the root causes of inequality. Politicians endlessly debate simple human rights and decency-based issues, such as bodily integrity, LGBT employment discrimination, the existence of racism and science, factual sex ed and birth control access, and affordable health care. Without this mind-melting drivel that basic UN declarations should suppress, people could bring up issues that pose a serious threat to the establishment. The GOP attracts its followers with false nostalgia for a socially “pure”, union-free, nuclear family-focused era with a functioning trickle-down of wealth, and the Ronald Reagan that never was. The Democrats will react and often call out GOP bullshit, yet remain solidly capitalist, and standstill in these issues, despite their progressive facade.
In all this mess, one self-described “socialist” candidate has excelled in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary election states. Bernie Sanders is uniquely “old labour”¹. Though no Corbyn, he definitely goes beyond mainstream political discussion, with a focus on stagnant wages despite increased productivity, racist police brutality, prohibitively expensive upper education, action on climate change, the recession's culprits remaining un-prosecuted, wealth inequality, and excess executive pay. Controversially, he takes a less intersectional, slightly nationalistic approach in not supporting open borders. While core socialists critique the unequal and unjustified hierarchies of capitalism, Sanders brings some of the same issues socialists care about to a general audience with a goal of stronger welfare programs within a capitalist republic akin to Scandinavian nations: better, but certainly not any real form of socialism, and still just as exploitative of world inequality as the US. His policies are solidly populist in a nation that's still recovering from McCarthyism, yet get cast as radical in the media due to their slightly disruptive approach to a skewed spectrum. We're taught that his “radically” new spirit is the left's counter to extremist candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson—men that tell us they'll deport tens of millions of people on their first day in office (without causing mass famine from the abolishment of our agriculture workforce). Ultimately, Sanders has diverted leftists away from true radical, direct action, and brought them back to the Democratic party, vaguely calling for a “political revolution,” by means of voting for him.
In a recent talk at MIT, famed anarchist philosopher Noam Chomsky responded to a question on the antics of Trump in relation to American exceptionalism.
Chomsky eloquently demonstrates the lack of ideological range within the GOP:
A couple of weeks ago, the two front-runners—they're not the front-runners any longer—were Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. And they differed on Iran. Walker said we have to bomb Iran; when he gets elected, they're going to bomb Iran immediately, the day he's elected. Bush was a little—you know, he's more serious: He said he's going to wait 'til the first Cabinet meeting, and then they'll bomb Iran. I mean, this is just off the spectrum of not only international opinion, but even relative sanity. It's a radical insurgency; it's not a political party. You can tell that even by the votes. I mean, any issue of any complexity is going to have some diversity of opinion. But when you get a unanimous vote to kill the Iranian deal or the Affordable Care Act or whatever the next thing may be, you know you're not dealing with a political party.
Chomsky continues, positing that the Republican Party has such unappealing policies that benefit only the most privileged, it must use radical religious fundamentalism and xenophobic nationalism to rally insecure people together against foreign cultures. It classes large groups of civilians as clashing religious fundamentalists on a mission to harm the white way of life.
I think what's actually happened is that during the whole so-called neoliberal period, last generation, both political parties have drifted to the right. Today's Democrats are what used to be called moderate Republicans. The Republicans have just drifted off the spectrum. They're so committed to extreme wealth and power that they cannot get votes, can't get votes by presenting those positions. So what has happened is that they've mobilized sectors of the population that have been around for a long time. It is a pretty exceptional country in many ways. One is it's extremely religious. It's one of the most extreme fundamentalist countries in the world. And by now, I suspect the majority of the base of the Republican Party is evangelical Christians, extremists, not—they're a mixture, but these are the extremist ones—nativists who are afraid that, you know, “they are taking our white Anglo-Saxon country away from us,” people who have to have guns when they go into Starbucks because, who knows, they might get killed by an Islamic terrorist and so on. I mean, all of that is part of the country, and it goes back to colonial days. There are real roots to it. But these have not been an organized political force in the past. They are now. That's the base of the Republican Party. And you see it in the primaries. So, yeah, Trump is maybe comic relief, but it's just a—it's not that different from the mainstream, which I think is more important.”
The United States is an oligarchical system that classifies a true populist, literally someone concerned for the ordinary people, as a radical, while right-wing, wealth-driven insurgency candidates are considered “electable,” and half of the largest political party would support a military coup d'etat. Our capitalist media has propagandized us just as much as any state media.
Knowing the true lack of power I have as a voter, I respect Emma Goldman's position. That said, I will ultimately vote pragmatically. I don't buy the argument that revolution will occur when more people just stop voting. Local referendums and initiatives (the only sliver of direct democracy we're given) matter, and are often close calls. The impending need for new Supreme Court justices predetermines the next president's legacy as powerful, so I'm hoping media coverage and money will go to a Democrat, if only to maintain bodily integrity rights and restored relations with Cuba. I will refuse to legitimize the occasion by letting it seem momentous. The passion people had in the 2008 Obama election made it feel real, and Sanders supporters are mirroring that facade-building passion. The oligarchical mechanics of this political race need to be made clear, and the fight should remain solely against fascism, without approving of lesser evils.

Yussuf K. said he carried out the January 2016 attack "in the name of Allah and the Islamic State." He added that he chose his victim because "he was Jewish."
March 2. In a landmark trial at the Paris Children's Court, a 17-year-old Turkish jihadist, identified only as Yussuf K., was sentenced to seven years in prison for attacking Benjamin Amsellem, a Jewish teacher in Marseille, with a machete. Yussuf K. said he carried out the January 2016 attack "in the name of Allah and the Islamic State." He added that he chose his victim because "he was Jewish." Yussuf K. was charged with "an individual terrorist attempt and attempted assassination in connection with a terrorist enterprise," with the aggravating circumstance of anti-Semitism. He was tried as a minor because he was 15 when he carried out the attack. The criminal trial of a minor on terror charges was the first of its kind in France, where some fifty children are currently being investigated for jihadist offenses.
March 2. The European Parliament voted to lift the immunity from prosecution for National Front leader Marine Le Pen for tweeting images of Islamic State violence. Under French law, publishing violent images can be punished by up to three years in prison and a fine of €75,000 euros ($79,000). Le Pen, a leading candidate in this year's French presidential election, posted the images in response to a journalist who compared her party's anti-immigration stance to the Islamic State. Le Pen denounced the legal proceedings against her as political interference in the campaign and called for a moratorium on judicial investigations until the election period has passed.
March 4. The mayor of the French port of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, signed a decree prohibiting aid groups from distributing meals to migrants and refugees at the site of the former "Jungle" migrant camp. The decree said food distribution by charities had led to large numbers of people gathering at the site of the now-closed camp, with fights breaking out and risks posed to the safety of local residents.
March 6. President François Hollande vowed to "do everything in his power" to prevent Marine Le Pen from winning the upcoming presidential election in France. Polls have suggested that Le Pen, leader of the National Front party, may win the first round of France's election on April 23. Le Pen, who has campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, has also vowed to hold a referendum on France's membership of the European Union. Hollande, who decided not to run for a second term, said it was his "ultimate duty to do everything to ensure that France is not convinced by such a plan" to take France out of the EU.
March 7. The 17th Criminal Tribunal of Paris acquitted the Moroccan-born French-Jewish scholar Georges Bensoussan of hate speech charges. The Collective against Islamophobia in France (Collectif Contre l'Islamophobie en France, CCIF) filed a lawsuit against Bensoussan, 64, for "public incitement to discrimination, hatred and violence against a group of people because of their religious affiliation" because of remarks he made on Radio France about Muslim anti-Semitism. He said:
"There will be no integration until we get rid of this atavistic anti-Semitism that is kept secret. It so happens that an Algerian sociologist, Smain Laacher, with great courage said that 'it is a disgrace to maintain this taboo, namely that in Arab families in France and elsewhere everyone knows that anti-Semitism is spread with the mother's milk.'"
In its ruling, the court said the plaintiffs failed to prove the charges of hate speech: "Bensoussan cannot be blamed to have aroused or wished to arouse a feeling of hostility or rejection against a group of persons and, even less, to have explicitly called for specific acts against the group." The judges added that the expression "anti-Semitism, it is sucked with the mother's milk" is a figure of speech, not the expression of "biological racism."
March 12. Mohammad Khan Wazir, a 30-year-old migrant from Afghanistan, was sentenced by the Criminal Court of Grasse (Alpes-Maritimes) to 18 months in prison for threatening to assassinate the city's judges. Wazir was visiting his three-year-old son, named Djihad (the French word for "jihad"), whom judges placed under state care in Grasse, when he allegedly said that he wanted to "go to court with a Kalashnikov to kill them all." After Wazir left Afghanistan in 2007, he met a French woman named Claire Khacer. The couple separated after the birth of their child in 2013. Khacer, who is pregnant with the child of an Islamic State jihadist, was arrested after returning to France from Syria. She is being held on charges of conspiring to join a terrorist enterprise. In court, Wazir admitted to threatening the judges. He said was he was "overwhelmed" by the slow pace of the French bureaucracy. His French-born son still does not have a French passport.
March 13. Sonia Imloul, a 43-year-old activist and the former head of a deradicalization program, was found guilty by the Paris Criminal Court of embezzling and laundering public funds. She was accused of misusing the €60,000 ($65,000) which the French Interior Ministry gave her association, the House of Prevention and the Families (Maison de la prévention et de la familles), for the purpose of discouraging French Muslims from going to Iraq and Syria. She received a four-month suspended prison sentence and was ordered to pay €25,000. The conviction, which came after Julien Revial, a student employed by Imloul, wrote a book exposing her scam, has highlighted the failure of the French government's deradicalization efforts.
March 15. Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux said that French security forces would begin dismantling the Grande-Synthe migrant camp on the northern coast near the port of Dunkirk "as soon as possible" after violent clashes at the site. The number of people at the camp has swelled to 1,500 since the destruction of the "Jungle" camp near Calais, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away. The Grande-Synthe camp, populated mostly by Kurds, was built to house migrants and refugees who otherwise sleep in tents or makeshift shelters. They gather along the northern coast of France trying to break into trucks heading to Britain or trying to pay smugglers to help them get across the Channel.
March 16. An Ifop poll found that 71% of French people believe the security situation in France has deteriorated during the past five years; 93% believe the terrorist threat remains high; 60% said they do not feel safe anywhere in the country; and 69% believe there are not enough police and gendarmes. The poll also found that 88% support deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes, and 81% support terminating social assistance to parents of repeat offenders.
March 17. A 30-year-old Muslim man yelling "Allahu Akhbar" slit the throats of his father and brother in the courtyard of their apartment building in Paris. Police said the dead men were found lying on the ground in pools of blood. Neighbors said the suspect had recently become radicalized and that his family was not happy about it. Police quickly dismissed terrorism as a motive for the crime; instead, they focused on "double intrafamilial homicide" in the context of "radicalization." The suspect was arrested and transferred to a psychiatric ward.
March 17. Presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the Left Party, proposed a solution to the debate over sharia-compliant meals in French schools. He said that vegetarian menus without meat in school canteens would answer both religious and ecological questions:
"You do not have meat, you can do without it. There's no need to eat meat all the time. When I was a kid, a lot of my friends were not eating pork because of their religion. We have to find a way that makes it possible for everyone to live well together. So, I would like to have vegetarian menus, menus without meat. There are other sources of protein besides meat. When you're at school, if there's a problem, go smile, vegetarian menus for everyone."
March 18. Ziyed Ben Belgacem, a 39-year-old French national of Tunisian origin, was shot dead at Paris Orly airport, the second-busiest airport in France, after grabbing a soldier's gun, and apparently intending to open fire on passengers. He shouted: "Put down your guns. Put your hands on your head. I am here to die for Allah. In any case, there will be deaths." Police said that Belgacem, who was born in Paris, was a "radicalized Muslim" who was known to the intelligence services. He was a career criminal with a long history of violence, robbery and drug offenses but despite his being investigated as a potential jihadist, Belgacem did not have an "S" file (Fiche "S" or Sûreté de l'État (state security), which flags individuals suspected of belonging to terrorist groups).
March 20. A confidential police report revealed that more than 50 organizations in Molenbeek, a migrant-dominated neighborhood of Brussels, Belgium, are believed to have ties to jihadist terrorism. More than 70 individuals are currently being monitored for suspected connections to jihadism. Most (46) reside in Belgium, while 26 are thought to be in Syria. Twenty people on the list are currently in prison. Counter-terrorism police have visited 8,603 homes and monitored 22,668 residents in Molenbeek, or one quarter of all of its inhabitants.
March 20. French Muslims between the ages of 14 and 16 are far more likely than non-Muslims to hold to "religious absolutism" and be "tolerant of taking violent action for ideological reasons" than non-Muslims, according to a survey of radicalism among French high school students. The study, carried out by the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), showed that "the dissemination of radical ideas in religious matters is approximately three times stronger among young Muslims than in the sample as a whole" and especially among boys (two times more often than girls). Nearly one-third (32%) of Muslim youth believe it is "acceptable in some cases to fight arms for their religion in today's society" compared to 8% of young people in general.
March 22. An Ipsos poll for France Television and Radio France found that 61% of the French believe that Islam is incompatible with French society, compared to 17% who believe the same is true for Judaism and 6% for Catholicism. Most respondents strongly endorsed proposals regulating Islam in the private sphere: 79% favor banning the veil in universities and 77% prohibiting the burkini in public spaces. An extremely large majority of the French (90%) believe that secularism is an essential value of the Republic, and 74% think it is threatened today (92% of Marine Le Pen's supporters feel this way). A majority of the French (60%) believe that the cohabitation between different religions does not happen well in France (85% of Marine Le Pen's supporters feel this way).
March 22. In an interview with De Morgen to mark the first anniversary of the jihadist attacks in Brussels, Mayor Yvan Mayeur warned: "Everyone knows that all mosques in Brussels are in the hands of Salafists. We need to change this, we need new mosques that follow our democratic rules and that are being controlled by the government." Salafists say they want to replace Western democracy with an Islamic government based on Sharia law.
The Collective against Islamophobia in Belgium (CTIB) condemned the mayor's remarks: "Those statements are very serious, manifestly incorrect and totally unacceptable from the mouth of a political representative of a cosmopolitan city such as Brussels."
Mayeur later called for a "mosque planting strategy" based on the "church plant model." This would give the government more control over what is preached inside the mosques. In an interview with the French-speaking RTBF radio, he said:
"I want a moderate Islam in Brussels. I have regular contact with two groups of people who want to build a mosque and who want to follow the standards in exchange for government support. I suggest that the government participates in the financing and control, a bit along the lines of the model of the church councils."
March 25. French anti-terrorism judges charged two men suspected of involvement in supplying a weapon to the gunman killed at Paris's Orly airport on March 18 after seizing the weapon of a soldier. The suspects, aged 30 and 43, were charged for "association with terrorist criminals."
March 29. Flanders, one of three official regions of Belgium, announced that it will impose new restrictions on the ritual slaughter of animals. As of January 1, 2019, all sheep will have to be stunned before they are slaughtered. The restrictions, which will eventually also apply to cattle, have been criticized by Muslim and Jewish groups as conflicting with their religious tenets.
March 30. The French Council of the Muslim Faith (Conseil français du culte musulman, CFCM), the official interlocutor between the French state and the country's Muslim community, in a bid to curb radical Islam, published a 12-point charter regarding the role of imams in society. The document, which all practicing imams will be encouraged to sign, recognizes the values of the French Republic and promotes tolerant Islam. The charter has been rejected by some of the biggest Muslim organizations in France, including the Grand Mosque of Paris and the Union of French Islamic Organizations (UOIF).
March 31. Up to a thousand Muslims rolled out rugs and prayed on the streets of Clichy, a northern suburb of Paris, to protest the closure of a mosque on rue Estienne-d'Orves. The mosque was shuttered after its lease expired and the municipality voted to turn the building into a library. Up to 5,000 worshippers prayed at the facility every day. City officials say that Muslims can worship at a new mosque that was inaugurated in May 2016. Muslims say the alternative facility is too small and remote.

A new court filing from Alphabet claims that Uber hid a key piece of self-driving technology that it allegedly copied from Waymo, the Google parent company's autonomous vehicle subsidiary.
“They were hiding a device,” Alphabet said in a filing today, supporting its motion for a preliminary injunction that would prevent Uber from working on self-driving technology.
Uber says it isn't hiding anything and did not infringe on Alphabet's patents.
Alphabet has sued Uber over claims it stole its proprietary self-driving technology. At the center of the suit is a former Alphabet executive, Anthony Levandowski, who led its early efforts in developing self-driving technology.
Alphabet claims Levandowski stole 14,000 files from Alphabet before leaving to launch his own autonomous truck startup, Otto. Uber acquired Otto last August. The files include designs for Alphabet's lidar (light detection and ranging) technology, a key component to most self-driving systems.
In the latest filing, Alphabet says Uber hid a lidar device Levandowski designed based on these files. The company says Uber obfuscated the existence of a piece of lidar technology at an April 12 hearing.
Uber denies this and says it eventually produced the device in question. A representative for Uber told Recode the company did not initially produce the device because they did not think they were required to do so as its design had been abandoned.
Alphabet has declined to say whether it has inspected the device in question.
Uber said in a previous filing opposing the preliminary injunction that Alphabet's allegations are “demonstrably false.”

As long as there has been a U.S. military, people have been leaving it. That choice has never been more appropriate than today. Individuals who signed up to defend the United States are engaged in a war that was sold on the basis of lies, was entirely unnecessary, is making us less safe, has nothing to do with defending anyone, and which involves the horror of slaughtering men, women, and children by the hundreds of thousands. The majority of Americans want the war to end and just voted accordingly in the Congressional elections. The majority of Iraqis want the war to end. The majority of American service men and women in Iraq want the war to end. And taking part in this war is illegal, whether you are ordered to do so or not.Approximately 6,000 Americans have refused to report for duty or deserted in order to avoid taking part in this war, or to avoid taking further part in it. Many have objected to the stop loss program that requires them to serve longer than they had agreed to. Others have objected to the rationale behind the war and the horrors that are part of it. Many are best able to support their families by avoiding military service that is poorly compensated. In the cases we know the most about, one motivation for desertion that is clearly absent is cowardice. While quiet desertion tends not to result in any penalty, public opposition and resistance often means prison.Lt. Ehren Watada, the first U.S. military commissioned officer to publicly refuse to fight in Iraq , has said that he will not obey an illegal order. He faces court martial on February 4, 2007, for obeying the law. Sgt. Camilo Mejia was one of the first Iraq War vets to publicly refuse to return to Iraq â€“ for which he served 9 months in prison. Mejia objected to the war as based on lies and to the murdering and torturing of civilians that he witnessed. Sgt. Kevin Benderman is serving a 15-month sentence for the crime of applying for conscientious objector status and refusing to serve any longer in Iraq . Marine Corps reservist Stephen Funk was the first enlisted man to publicly refuse deployment to Iraq , and he spent 6 months in prison as a result. He said: "I will not obey an unjust war based on deception by our leaders."Dan Felushko enlisted as a Marine after September 11, 2001. When ordered to Iraq he deserted, commenting: "I didn't want 'Died Deluded in Iraq ' over my gravestone. I didn't see a connection between the attack on America and Saddam Hussein."
Some who have deserted and been AWOL for months or years have decided that it is their proper duty to turn themselves in and face court martial. Ricky Clousing has done this. He explains why in this video:
{youtube}ZfUfUrV0Sv4{/youtube}
Agustin Aguayo has done the same and faces charges with a maximum penalty of 7 years.
In many cases, turning yourself in is not easy. Pvt. Kyle Snyder, who spent Thanksgiving helping restore houses in New Orleans with Iraq Veterans Against the War, is currently AWOL and says that his lawyer has tried to contact the military 75 times.
The Army used to pay bounties for turning in deserters. Now the U.S. military leaves deserters alone but requires the troops who don't desert to serve longer than they agreed to. (These days we even elect deserters president. Bush was AWOL during the Vietnam War, and Clinton too avoided serving.) This is a break with the past, but much about resistance to the military has changed little since 1776.
Robert Fantina has just published a careful survey of past wars titled "Desertion and the American Soldier, 1776 â€“ 2006." During the Revolutionary War, he tells us, one reason for desertion was the corporal punishment endured in the military. Men were often given 100 lashes. When George Washington was unable to convince Congress to raise the legal limit to 500 lashes, he considered using hard labor as a punishment instead, but dropped that idea because the hard labor was indistinguishable from regular service in the Continental Army. Soldiers also left because they needed food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and money. They signed up for pay, were not paid, and endangered their families' well being by remaining in the Army unpaid.
During the Mexican-American War, in a tribute to a future president, soldiers were branded on the face with a "W" if for some reason they were deemed worthless. This sort of treatment, as in the Revolutionary War, was one reason for desertions, but another reason played a large role and would play an increasingly prominent role in desertions through the course of later wars: lack of belief in the cause.
Through the course of recounting the types of desertions prevalent during the various U.S. wars and peace time, Fantina slowly begins to make a case for reforms in the military that he believes would reduce desertions. By the time he's discussing World War I he's arguing as follows: "Without fundamental change that allows a man or woman to be, first and foremost a human being, and a soldier only by chosen occupation, the military will continue to struggle with desertion."
But if, as Fantina proposes, soldiers are permitted to resign at any time, will we not see mass resignations? If troops now serving in Iraq could legally choose to quit, wouldn't many of them do so?
Fantina lists the various rights that soldiers die fighting to supposedly protect but which, as soldiers, they are denied. He views this as hypocrisy and injustice. But is it not necessary in order to get people to kill each other?
Fantina describes cases in which deserters have been executed, deserters whose desertion put no one at risk, whose desertion was arguably justified, whose current lives were a threat to no one. "One can only wonder what good such [executions] accomplish," writes Fantina. But those who make war don't wonder much, I think. Does Fantina not see that he is calling into question the entire logic of war?
In the book's final pages, Fantina writes: "The following list of military reforms was suggested in 1903: over 100 years later, most of them are yet to be implemented, yet they would certainly contribute to a more stable military force:
Private soldiers to receive a substantial increase in pay. The employment of trained cooks. Recognition of the right of all soldiers of whatever position to engage in criticism and in free speech at all times and under all circumstances. All the food a soldier wishes to eat, instead of being limited as at present, to an inadequate 'ration'. Absolute amnesty to all deserters from the army and navy. The erection of modern sanitary buildings at all places where troops are quartered. Service in the army to be limited to two years. Abolition of military salutes and all other imbecile and servile practices. Thorough practice in mobility, rapid field movements, quick concentration, with special attention to supplying the troops promptly and regularly with abundant, wholesome nourishing food. All soldiers and officers, whatsoever, to eat exactly the same food, and to be housed or quartered alike at all times and in all places. Prohibition of all forms of torture and violence."
Of course, Fantina is right. It is a disgrace the way we mistreat those who risk their lives for us. But would rectifying this produce a more stable force or a force likely to collapse when ordered to kill innocent people for power-mad cowboys and their oil profits?Then again, would that be such a bad thing? Does anyone doubt for a minute that if the United States were actually threatened soldiers would sign up to fight proudly in its defense? Many did so following September 11, 2001. Many of them have since deserted. And rightly so. They, the deserters and resisters, are the ones to whom we owe the most gratitude.
An incredible tug-of-war between the two stars in the binary pulsar system J1906 actually warps space-time itself owing to the powerful effects of each on the other. Owing to its spin, the pulsar emits a sort-of lighthouse-like beam of radio-waves roughly every 144 milliseconds.
New research from the University of British Columbia has now resulted in the measurement of both of these stars, giving a much deeper understanding of the processes at work.
“By precisely tracking the motion of the pulsar, we were able to measure the gravitational interaction between the two highly compact stars with extreme precision,” states UBC astronomer/physics-professor Ingrid Stairs.
“These two stars each weigh more than the Sun, but are still over 100 times closer together than Earth is to the Sun. The resulting extreme gravity causes many remarkable effects.”
As per the mental-model known as general relativity, neutron-stars oscillate somewhat like a spinning top as they make their way through the “gravitational well” of their companion stars. And so, every orbit sees the pulsar make its way a space-time that is curved — resulting in notable impacts on the spin-axis of the star.
“Through the effects of the immense mutual gravitational pull, the spin axis of the pulsar has now wobbled so much that the beams no longer hit Earth,” astrophysicist Joeri van Leeuwen states. Leeuwen, who works at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy and the University of Amsterdam,was the lead researcher on the new work.
“The pulsar is now all but invisible to even the largest telescopes on Earth. This is the first time such a young pulsar has disappeared through precession. Fortunately this cosmic spinning top is expected to wobble back into view, but it might take as long as 160 years.”
This new research is notable as only a handful of double neutron-stars have had their mass measured, to date. And, also, J1906 is apparently the youngest to so have. J1906 is around ~25,000 light years from the Earth.
The new findings were recently published in the Astrophysical Journal.

Shipping Sickness
or, Twilight Sparkle Gets Intimate With Her Table, Part One
Jeffrey C. Wells

* * *
Deep in the purple force-fielded darkness of the Ponyville Library's common room, now crowded almost to bursting with purloined furniture, an unlikely puppet-master was speaking to a rather large armoire. Rather more unusually than that, the armoire appeared to be taking careful note of her words.
"All right!" declared an utterly mane-frazzled Twilight Sparkle, a tiny nervous tic picking at her eyelid as she paced back and forth in front of the sizable piece of furniture. "You are no longer just a cabinet! You are now Shining Armoire, captain of my Royal Guard!"
"Something's wrong here," said Shining Armoire. "I'm... pretty sure I belong to a pony named Rarity?"
"Not today!" cried Twilight, her irises shrunken to the size of bit-coins. The little unicorn's horn flared as she dragged a markedly less-towering bit of furniture across the floor, its stubby animated legs scrabbling to keep up. "This," declared Twilight, "is your bride, Princess Mi Amore Credenza. On the surface, you have a happy marriage, following a beautiful wedding that you almost didn't inform your sister about!"
"Wait, wait, hold on," said Shining Armoire, "who's my sister again?"
Twilight glanced around the room and then, coming to a decision, blasted a tiny fairy-lamp with yet another Advanced Come-To-Life spell. "There. That's your sister, Nightlight Sparkle."
"I approve of everything that's going on here," said Nightlight Sparkle. "Even the construction of a giant force-field around the library so that no one in town can interrupt your master plan to forcibly manufacture a satisfying atmosphere of romantic tension using sapient furniture."
"Thank you, Nightlight Sparkle," said Twilight, sniffing primly. She turned her attention back to the rather larger pieces of furniture in front of her. "So, everything should be happy between you two lovebirds, right?"
"It... certainly seems that way," said Princess Mi Amore Credenza. "I mean, Shining Armoire is a handsome enough wardrobe. I think we could be pretty good friends, at least, right?"
"Wrong!" shouted Twilight, gesturing with one hoof. "Because you, Princess Credenza, have secret amorous designs on Princess Sofa, immortal and extremely comfy alicorn of the night sky!" She gave the credenza a sly look. "They say she's a love-seat."
"But... why would I do that to Shining Armoire?" protested Princess Credenza.
"YES, PRITHEE, EXPLAIN!" thundered Princess Sofa. "WE FIND THE TWO OF THEM TO BE A DELIGHTFUL COUPLE!"
"Oh, what do you know?" snapped Twilight. "I just brought you to life five minutes ago!" Twilight's gaze spun around the room like a crazed drill sergeant improbably surrounded by his own troops on all sides. "And what's up with you hanging lamps?" she cried. "You're supposed to be swinging!"
"We've decided that we prefer monogamy," said a hanging lamp. Somewhere in the darkness, there came the noise of a rhythm hit on a trap-set.
Twilight frowned, then waded through the sea of furniture until she found the drum kit she'd taken from Pinkie Pie. "No," she said to it, sternly.
"Sorry," muttered the drum kit.
Twilight pounded a hoof on a nearby desk. "What's wrong with you furniture?" she exclaimed.
"Ow," said the desk.
"Sorry," she said. "But, seriously, what's wrong with you? Why aren't you engaging in sexy romantic liaisons with each other? You're as bad as the actual ponies I know in real life!" Her neck twitched a little, causing her completely disheveled mane to rustle like a cheerleader's pompon. "They all laughed, laughed at me when they discovered the secret book of romantic stories that I've been writing about all of them!"
She blinked, a flicker of sanity reentering her bloodshot eyes. "Well, maybe they didn't actually laugh," she caveated. "Really, they were quite understanding. But they told me in no uncertain terms that none of them harbor any hidden lusts for one another."
As quickly as it had appeared, the flicker of sanity guttered and was gone. "It was so humiliating!" she cried. "I'm tired of being embarrassed about my romantic fantasies! From now on, I'm going to live in a tiny world of my own devising. If I can't find a universe filled with romantic tension... I'll make a universe filled with romantic tension!"
As she stood there in the darkness, her chest heaving from the force of her tirade, Twilight Sparkle felt the little nudge of a drawer-pull on her shoulder. "Excuse me," came a gentle voice.
The unicorn turned and looked to see a little bedside table standing next to her, its front drawer bashfully extended. Her very own bedside table, in fact.
"I know you," said Twilight, quietly.
"You should," said the bedside table. "I'm one of the few pieces of furniture in this room you haven't stolen."
"Temporarily borrowed," corrected Twilight.
"Semantics," said the table, gesturing absently with a drawer. "What I was going to say was, romance isn't something that you get by awkwardly placing two pieces of furniture next to each other and making them interact. Romance is something deeper, and far more special, than that. It's not some sort of magic spark that happens all at once. It does depend on the feelings you have during the time you spend together, yes. But it's less an emotion and more an action you take; in fact, it's a series of actions you and your very special sometable take, together, throughout your entire life. And that's not something you can force into being over the course of an afternoon."
Twilight gazed deeply at her bedside table. The bedside table gazed back at her.
The little purple librarian sagged, then. "You're right, little bedside table," she said. "This is all really foalish of me." She sniffled a little.
"Don't cry," said the table. "There's a pure desire underneath your strangeness of execution. All you want is for ponies and, by extension, their furniture, to love each other. You just need a little more time and experience to realize what love truly is."
"Thank you, table," said Twilight Sparkle, wiping away a few tears. "Hey, how did you get to be so smart?"
"Books," said the table, modestly. "Every night when you finally raise the gumption to drag yourself to bed, you're still never ready to break from your reading. I am there beside you every night, watching you read, happy to be the thing that supports your lamp and your little mug of bedtime tea. Thank you for always using a coaster, by the way. It means a lot."
"You're welcome, table," said Twilight.
"And when you finally, finally can't keep your eyes open for even one more moment, you lay your book down upon me and shut out the light, and I abide all night feeling the weight of your chosen words upon me. It is a thrill and a comfort to serve you in this way."
"Gosh," said Twilight. "I never knew you felt that way, bedside table."
The bedside table turned away, looking a bit ashamed. "I have to admit," it said, its voice thick with emotion, "that all my proselytizing aside, I do have feelings for you, Twilight Sparkle, though I know you have always favored your writing desk over me."
"Don't say that!" cried Twilight. "Yes, I love my writing desk! In its own way, it's my faithful collaborator on all my letters and stories, and yes, I'm very fond of it. But I never share tea with it, like I do with you. And I never sleep next to it at night." Twilight took a moment to stroke the table's smooth, well-sanded surface. "Bedside table," she said, "I'm so grateful to you for all the jobs you do as the one piece of furniture I keep next to my bed, and you will always be special to me."
The table gave a shuddering sigh, and there was a note of bliss in it. "May I share a secret with you, Twilight Sparkle?" it asked.
"Of course, table," said Twilight.
"You speak of sleeping next to me at night," it said, "but always, there is a distance between us. I must confess that, just once, I would like to lie with you as an equal." The table looked a bit downcast, then. "I quake at my forwardness; perhaps I should not—"
"No!" said Twilight. "Please, I want to hear it!"
The table squared its top. "Twilight Sparkle," it said, "would you share your bed with me?"
"Oh, dear sweet little table," said Twilight, laying her hoof gently upon its top. Then she stopped. "Wait, that'd be kind of weird. Did I or did I not animate my bed today?"
"I would never stand between the two of you," said the table, hastily.
"No, no, it's all right," said Twilight. "I think my bed is still just my bed." She knelt down beside the table, spreading her mane across its surface. "Little bedside table," she said, "I am so touched that I mean that much to you."
"Don't worry," said the table. "If you're still thinking about it, I don't intend any funny stuff. I am a gentletable, and besides, it could never work between us. I am furniture, and you are pony. We come from two vastly different worlds, destined to be forever together and yet forever apart. But here, on this one magic afternoon where our worlds have intersected, just for a moment, I would like you to hold me as you drift off to sleep. Just once."
"It's not nighttime yet."
"Afternoon nap, then," said the table, eagerly. "Please, Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight closed her eyes. She breathed, softly, once, twice, her breath fogging against the table's glossy, impeccably-waxed finish.
"All right," she said. "I would be honored to accommodate you. Let's go up to my loft."
"You," said the table, "have just made me the happiest piece of furniture in the world."
And with that, the two old companions made their way out of the common room, upstairs to the unicorn's bed.
A moment of silence passed.
"Um, should we have been watching all that?" remarked Shining Armoire.
* * *
Twilight Sparkle was roused from her nap by the bright coruscating flash of a Princess-level Failsafe spell, a flash that tore away the layers upon layers of purple force with which she had shrouded the library. Blinking against the sudden sunlight, she disentangled her hooves from the legs of her bedside table, half-hidden next to her beneath a spread of astronomy-print sheets. It was the second Princess-level Failsafe spell that had been unleashed upon Ponyville in as many months, and there was a part of Twilight that hovered on the verge of panic in expectation of yet another calm, impossibly patient upbraiding from her mentor and teacher; but right now, in this present moment, such thoughts were second in her mind to a single question that burned in her. She bit her lip and turned to her faithful table.
"Bedside table?" she whispered, quietly. "Are... are you still with me?
There was no response. The Princess-level Failsafe spell had stripped all her well-intentioned enchantments from the library, including every last Advanced Come-To-Life spell. All the furniture constructs she had made were back in their own world now, and it was for the best, of course; as her table had said, furniture was furniture and pony was pony.
But still, there was a pang of loss and regret in Twilight Sparkle's heart. She had felt such kinship with her bedside table, for those few fleeting instants. And just for a moment there, she thought... maybe...
Twilight Sparkle sighed.
"I thought maybe I could love you," she whispered. "But you were right. We're not each other's soulmates. We can never be together, not truly. For I am a pony wizardess..."
Twilight sighed again and laid her head against her faithful table, cuddling up against it one last time.
"...and you," she said, "are just my one nightstand."
Obama will support credit card reform, hoping to spur increase in savings rate RAW STORY
Published: Sunday April 19, 2009
Print This Email This One of Americans' traditional financial foes  credit cards companies  may soon be more tightly regulated in favor of consumers.
President Barack Obama is willing to sign a "credit card bill of rights" if it is passed by Congress, White House economic adviser Larry Summers said today on NBC's Meet the Press. The bill, under consideration by both the House and the Senate, would - among other things - limit the ability of credit card companies to raise interest rates on existing balances.
The changes would be a huge relief to Americans drowning in debt during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The White House hopes it will spur an increase in the current historically low U.S. household savings rate.
Summers said Obama will soon focus "on a whole set of issues having to do with credit card abuses, having to do with the way people have been deceived into paying extraordinarily high rates that they wouldn't have paid if they knew what they were getting themselves into."
The AP reported:
Summers said the administration wants to see a better-regulated financial system, encourage savings and eventually get back to a situation where government spending is not a drain on the economy.
"Individuals are going to have to save more, that's why savings incentives are so important," he said. "That's why we need to do things to stop the marketing of credit in ways that addicts people to it - so that our households are again saving, and families are again preparing to send kids to college, for their retirement, and so forth."

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian speaks during a news conference at the headquarters of the prime minister's office in Tripoli, Libya September 4, 2017 . REUTERS/Ismail Zitouny
PARIS (Reuters) - France's foreign minister said on Wednesday he was worried that U.S. President Donald Trump could put into doubt a nuclear deal between Iran and a group of major world powers.
“The agreement which was passed two years ago enables Iran to give up on a nuclear weapon and so avoid proliferation. We have to guarantee this stance,” Jean-Yves Le Drian said during a visit to Science-Po university in Paris.
“I am worried at this moment in time by the position of President Trump, who could put into question this accord. And if this accord is put into question then voices in Iran will speak up to say: ‘Let's also have a nuclear weapon.' We are in an extremely dangerous spiral for the world.”
On 4 March 2017, the web site The Last Line of Defense published an article positing that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of former president Barack Obama over the (unsubstantiated) claim that he had illegally ordered wiretapping of telephones at Trump Tower prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election:
Former president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: “The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton's aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can't find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.” The call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obama's phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will be pardoning him anytime soon.
None of this was true. Barack Obama was not arrested, nor was a warrant issued for his arrest. No FBI spokesman named “Todd McMartin” made a statement about Obama's supposed imminent arrest to Fox News, nor to any other news organization (and an FBI spokesman would not be able to publicly comment on an investigation in progress in any case). And, of course, the notion that President Trump could order a wiretap solely via executive order to incriminate another president who ordered a wiretap without a federal order “legally authorized by a judge” is an amusing irony.
This “news” about Barack Obama's imminent arrest originated with The Last Line of Defense, a well known “satirical” (i.e., fake news) web site whose disclaimer notes that:
DISCLAIMER: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don't necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.
The Last Line of Defense followed up this spoof article the following day with another fabricated piece detailing Obama's supposed arrest in Canada:
This morning, Obama was stopped at a checkpoint at Toronto International Airport, where he was trying to fly to an unknown destination under the alias “Bruce Wilekenmeyer.” The CRMP officer who stopped him recognized him beneath a fake mustache, took him into custody and turned him over to the US Embassy. After short transport back to Washington, Obama was brought before a special session of US District Court where he could be formally charged and ordered not to leave the country before being released into his attorney's custody.
The story re-emerged in late March 2017when it was picked up by dubious aggregator sites, but remains false.
Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency that's trading at all-time highs.
Lost a bit in the mainstream spotlight has been ether, the cryptographic token that powers of the ethereum blockchain. But, when compared to bitcoin's nearly 50% surge in value since the start of the year, ethereum's 900% climb is worth examining in context.
From roughly $8 on 1st January to an all-time high of $82 this week, ether has come a long way since It's began trading in 2015.
Here are 5 things newcomers may benefit from knowing about the market.
1) It's not an overnight success
Since early 2016, ether has been the second-largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, managing to outshine more tenured alternative asset protocols such as litecoin and ripple, according to CoinMarketCap data.
This sharp increase has taken place as the broader cryptocurrency space has attracted significant capital inflows, rising almost $7bn in value in Q1 2017.
During this time frame, the price of ether returned more than 500%.
When examined over a broader time frame, cryptocurrency's price gains have been even more impressive, as ether has appreciated more than 2,800% since it 2015.
2) It's volume has varied wildly
Ether's trading volume has fluctuated quite a bit during its history.
Trading activity for this digital asset was very modest at times, with 24-hour trading volume falling below $100,000 in some cases. At other times, this activity surged, with 24-hour volume nearing $600m in March.
Overall, however, the market has seen a gradual upward trending, with volume picking up notably in March and April.
3) Search interest is nearing highs
What does search interest have to do with price?
As CoinDesk contributor Willy Woo has put forward – quite a bit given that most traders and buyers Google the price first. (Woo has even described a whole strategy around gaining insights from such data).
Ether's search interest has risen sharply in the last few years, although its upward movement coincided with some significant pullbacks, according to Google Trends.
The cryptocurrency's search interest peaked in mid-March, as the term “ethereum” attained its highest point of popularity between 12th and 18th March.
When broken down by geographic region, the search interest for this term has been quite varied, according to additional data from Google Trends.
Switzerland has been the post popular area for these searches over the last five years, with Venezuela coming in a close second, claiming 95% of the search interest.
4) Bitcoin exchanges sell it
Several major exchanges have started offering ether trading to customers over the last few years. Poloniex, the single largest exchange in terms of ETH/BTC volume began offering the currency pair in August 2015.
Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinbase and Gemini followed suit shortly after, with some offering US dollar trading. Other companies provide their clients with over-the-counter (OTC) trading of this cryptocurrency.
Genesis Trading, for example, began offering OTC ether trading in early 2016, and Octagon Strategy started providing this service for its clients in March 2017.
5) Ethereum has its own tokens
Due to the design of the ethereum platform, developers are able to issue their own assets on top of the blockchain network.
The number of token sales for ethereum-based projects has surged over the last year, and is gaining steam. As a result, there's a strong belief interest in these projects could continue to fuel trading interest and demand.

A mother from Eritrea and her seven children moved to the village of 1,085 people three years ago after receiving a B permit, which allows her to stay for five years with the possibility of extension, the newspaper said.
The municipality immediately began paying monthly rent of 1,500 francs, plus 2,600 francs a month to cover family costs.
But the mother was quickly overwhelmed and now four of her offspring are in a children's home at the village's expense, Blick said.
In addition, social workers help the mother shop, cook and clean and take the other children on outings, working six hours a day, seven days a week.
The total bill amounts to 30 percent of the village's expenses.
The municipality is looking at raising taxes by five percent to cover the costs.
“I do not know where to turn,” village mayor Therese Schlaepfer told Blick.
“We probably have no other choice but to raise taxes.”
The mayor, a member of the right-wing Swiss People's Party, blamed federal and cantonal policies for putting the burden on the village.
It is “disturbing that these families have no obligations, only rights,” Shlaepfer is quoted as telling Blick.

Like the U.S., Australia is faced with a scandal involving women in the military. That's where the similarities end, however. While American generals have been criticized for their handling of an epidemic of sexual assaults, Australia's army chief, David Morrison, is getting rave reviews for a blistering video he released this week demanding, through clenched teeth, that sexists in his country's military mend their ways or find another place to work.
Morrison this week revealed that 17 military personnel, including high-ranking officers, were under investigation for allegedly creating and exchanging "explicit and profane" emails and images that were demeaning to women. Three of them have been suspended.
"Those who think that it is okay to behave in a way that demeans or exploits their colleagues have no place in this army," Morrison says in the video. "Female soldiers and officers have proven themselves worthy of the best traditions of the Australian army... If that does not suit you, then get out... There is no place for you amongst this band of brothers and sisters."
Morrison also promises to be "ruthless" in rooting out sex abuse in the ranks, and urges all soldiers to do their part if they witness abuse. "Show moral courage and take a stand," he says.
Commentators in Australia and the U.S. say the withering message was exactly what everyone — victims and abusers alike — needed to hear. "Holeeee. Efffing. Crap," says Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon. "It's brilliant."
The words are powerful. But the utterly credible fury is what nails it. It is a validation of the frustration and anger a whole lot of people who have been on the receiving end of that 'toughness' have been enduring for a very long time. And it says, yeah, you're right. This is goddamn outrageous. [Salon]
Morrison's direct, unflinching attacks on abusers have left observers slack-jawed. "Er, hang on," writes Sean Power at Mamamia. "Where are all the weasel words, the evasive language, and the spin?... This bloke is the real deal."
Share. It's time to interrogate. It's time to interrogate.
A few weeks ago, we posted a series of exclusive videos outlining each multiplayer map in the PlayStation 3-exclusive The Last of Us. It was there that we talked about how much we loved playing online, and were excited for future DLC announcements for The Last of Us that developer Naughty Dog has been teasing.
Today, one such mode was revealed by Kotaku. The new mode – called Interrogation – will come with patch 1.03, meaning the mode will be available completely free of charge.
Exit Theatre Mode
Interrogation mode is "complicated," according to multiplayer designer Robert Ryan, but the crux of the mode is this: find and raid your opponents' safe by interrogating fallen players via special executions. Your team must collectively interrogate five opponents to find the location of their lockbox, and interrogations take quite a bit longer than a special execution, leaving you susceptible to attack.
Interrogation comes in two waves – collecting information and then cracking the enemy safe – and you can only do the latter task by successfully completing the former task.
Patch 1.03 also comes with five significant fixes, listed below.
When reviving a teammate, your range has been increased.
Item bin locations have been rebalanced in some places.
Special executions can now be halted by teammates.
Matchmaking has been improved.
Item spawns have been tweaked to not give teams either many items.
We've reached out to Sony for more information, including the release date of the patch, and we'll update when we hear back.

The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs , struck a similar note. “I do not believe that this will affect the reset of our relationship with Russia,” he said. “We have made great progress in the past year and a half working on issues of mutual concern.” Asked if the White House found it offensive for its partner to be spying on the United States , he said the case was “important,” but a law enforcement matter.
Meanwhile on Tuesday, the police in Cyprus arrested the man known as Christopher R. Metsos, the last of the spying suspects to be detained, and American officials disclosed that they had moved to make arrests over the weekend because one of the people suspected of being Russian agents, who called himself Richard Murphy, was planning to fly out of the United States on Sunday night, possibly for good.
After years of painstaking surveillance, the F.B.I. did not want any of its targets to escape, and “you can't take down one without taking down all of them,” one law enforcement official said.
The F.B.I. on Sunday arrested 10 people in Yonkers, Manhattan , New Jersey , Boston and Virginia and charged them with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. Most were also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering.
American officials said they believed that most of the accused spies had been born in Russia and had been given sophisticated training before resettling in the United States, posing as married couples. They connected with various Americans of influence or knowledge, including a “prominent New York-based financier” described as a political fund-raiser with personal ties to a cabinet official, a former high-ranking national security official, and a nuclear weapons expert.

But they were instructed not to seek government jobs, because spy bosses in Moscow thought their cover stories would not stand up under a serious background investigation. So they were assigned to feed to Moscow what amounted to briefing papers on economics issues, American government players and diplomatic and military affairs.

One, the agent known as Cynthia Murphy, talked to New York contacts and reported on “prospects for the global gold market” that her bosses (whose spelling in English-language messages was imperfect) told her were “v. usefull” and passed to the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Before a visit to Moscow by President Obama last year, Ms. Murphy and her ostensible husband, Mr. Murphy, were instructed to size up American intentions from their home in Montclair, N.J. “Try to outline their views and most important Obama's goals which he expects to achieve during summit in July and how does his team plan to do it (arguments, provisions, means of persuasion to ‘lure' [Russia] into cooperation in US interests),” the spy bosses in Moscow asked, according to the charging papers.

Another time, Moscow offered vague instructions that might have been directed to journalists: “Try to single out tidbits unknown publicly but revealed in private by sources close to State department, Government, major think tanks.”
But why would Russian intelligence ask for such information from people settled in New Jersey rather than, say, Russian Embassy experts or specialists in Moscow or Washington?
“It's a Hail Mary pass,” said Milton A. Bearden, who served for three decades in the C.I.A.'s clandestine service and ran its Soviet and East European division as the Soviet Union fell.

“Maybe I end up next to a guy that is the minority staff director on some committee members and we do barbecues, or I coach his kid in Little League,” Mr. Bearden said. “How can you lose?”
For the Russian government, he said, supporting the so-called illegals operation was probably relatively inexpensive, particularly because some suspected agents were self-supporting, as court papers show.
One, Ms. Murphy, reported an annual income of $135,000 as a financial planner , her affidavit says. And another, Anna Chapman, owned her own real estate firm in Manhattan, which her lawyer said in court was valued by his client at $2 million.
If anything, the challenge for Moscow in an operation of such duration was to make sure its agents remained loyal amid the comforts of daily suburban American life. After the collapse of Communism, Mr. Bearden said, several Czech “sleeper agents” in the United States refused to go home, saying they felt they had become Americans.
“What's their life like, and particularly if it goes on for years?” said Burton Gerber, a former chief of the C.I.A.'s Soviet division, of the suspected Russian agents. For couples with children, for example, they may be “very guilty spies,” Mr. Gerber said, and yet influenced by P.T.A. and after-school sports.

“At some stage, do you begin to think of yourself more than American as Russian?” he said. “Without feeling a sense of betraying Russia, they may just want to lead quiet lives.”

Early Monday morning, five Arab states—Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen—along with the Maldives, broke all diplomatic and physical ties with the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar. All six countries say they are withdrawing their diplomats from Qatar within 48 hours and expect Qatari diplomats to reciprocate within the same time frame, and other Qatari nationals in those countries have two weeks to leave. Those countries have also cut all land, sea, and air contact with Qatar—meaning, among other things, that Qatar's land border with Saudi Arabia is now closed, airlines from those six countries will no longer fly into Qatar, and Qatar Airways flights have been barred from their airspace.
In its official statement explaining this move, Riyadh noted Qatar's “grave violations” against Saudi Arabia and Bahrain:
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has taken this decisive decision as a result of grave violations being committed by the authorities in Doha over the past years in secret and public aiming at dividing internal Saudi ranks, instigating against the State, infringing on its sovereignty, adopting various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region including the Muslim Brotherhood Group, Daesh (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda, promoting the ethics and plans of these groups through its media permanently, supporting the activities of Iranian-backed terrorist groups in the governorate of Qatif of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Bahrain, financing, adopting and sheltering extremists who seek to undermine the stability and unity of the homeland at home and abroad, and using the media that seek to fuel the strife internally; and it was clear to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the support and backing from the authorities in Doha for coup Al-Houthi militias even after the announcement of the Coalition to Support the Legitimacy in Yemen. The Kingdom has also taken this decision in solidarity with the Kingdom of Bahrain being subjected to terrorist campaigns and operations supported by the authorities in Doha.
The statement offered no evidence in support of these charges, only one of which (Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood) is well documented. The charge that Doha has been aiding Houthi militants in Yemen is particularly interesting given that Qatari soldiers have been participating in, and reportedly suffering on behalf of, the Saudi-led, anti-Houthi military coalition. In response, Qatar's government declared that there was “no legitimate justification” for this move and argued that it was an effort to “impose guardianship” on Qatar and thus was a “violation of its sovereignty.”
This is a fast-developing story, but certain core elements of it appear to have taken shape.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar have had a love-hate relationship for over two decades—a fact acknowledged in Monday's statement from Riyadh: “Since 1995, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its brothers have made strenuous and continued efforts to urge the authorities in Doha to abide by its commitments and agreements.” The Saudis didn't select that date at random. In 1995, the former Emir of Qatar, Hamad b. Khalifa Al Thani, overthrew his father, Khalifa b. Hamad Al Thani, in a bloodless coup. Sheikh Hamad abdicated in 2013 in favor of his son, Tamim, who is the current Qatari ruler. Hamad's decision to maintain friendly relations with Israel (Qatar broke off those relations over the 2009 Gaza War) was a source of tension with the Saudis. For several years the two countries also disputed the precise location of their land border, before finally reaching an agreement on its location in 2008. Monday's events come out of this years-long tension.
The immediate cause of the diplomatic break can be traced back to the 2011 Arab Spring. Unlike Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which quickly opposed any revolutionary movements that threatened established Arab autocracies, Qatar decided to bet on the revolutionaries and used some of its vast fossil-fuel wealth to support them. In particular, Sheikh Hamad decided to throw its weight behind Muslim Brotherhood movements in Egypt, Libya, and elsewhere, building off of his long-standing support for Brotherhood branches around the Arab world, including Hamas. This represented a radical shift from Hamad's previous “no problems” foreign policy, which presumably reflected Hamad's desire to increase Qatar's prominence on the geopolitical stage commensurate with its financial clout. Under Hamad, and then Tamim, Qatar has adopted a number of foreign policies that have at times, placed it at odds with its fellow Gulf states:
Qatar was an early supporter of Egypt's Arab Spring uprising and the elected Muslim Brotherhood-led government that succeeded former dictator Hosni Mubarak. Doha pumped an estimated $10 billion into Mohamed Morsi's government and lined up deals to sell natural gas to Egypt and help rebuild the Suez Canal. In contrast, Riyadh, which loathes the Muslim Brotherhood, has poured at least $12 billion into Egyptian coffers since the military coup that overthrew Morsi and brought Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to power in 2013. Qatar's support for Morsi explains why the Saudis initiated this boycott and why Egypt joined it.
Qatar supported the now-defunct General National Congress in Libya. The Islamist GNC, based in Tripoli was one of two competing governments, alongside the House of Representatives based in Tobruk, that contested control of Libya after the Arab Spring-driven fall of Muammar Gaddafi. It has since been driven mostly out of the picture by the country's internationally recognized Government of National Accord, also based in Tripoli. The UAE, in contrast, supported and continues to support the secularist Tobruk government (which has also announced that it has broken off ties with Qatar, but since it's not a recognized government the impact of that decision is minimal). For a time the two Gulf states were effectively fighting a proxy war in Libya that helped destabilize that country and contributed to tensions in the Gulf.
Qatar has also played an active role supporting and arming Syrian rebel groups, including—allegedly—extremist groups like the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front (also known as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) and even the Islamic State (ISIS or IS). It's possible that this has contributed to inter-Gulf tensions. But as the Saudis have allegedly been supporting these same rebel groups it's hard to see what the problem would have been. However, in April, Qatar was reportedly behind a negotiated settlement to evacuate four besieged Syrian towns, a deal Doha reportedly reached through negotiations with Iran. Qatar's cordial relationship with Iran, in addition to its support for the Muslim Brotherhood, is one of Riyadh's chief grievances.
Qatar has also long supported Hamas, whose biggest foreign patron has consistently been Iran. And with the Saudis coming together with Israel over their shared hostility toward Iran, Riyadh would certainly not have viewed that support for Hamas favorably.
There's one other elephant in this room, which is Qatar's support of the Al Jazeera network. The Saudis and Emiratis in particular have long criticized the news channel for promoting Muslim Brotherhood voices and for criticizing the policies of other Gulf states. After announcing the diplomatic cut off on Monday, Riyadh shut down Al Jazeera's local offices.
This is not the first time these tensions have come to a boiling point. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE cut diplomatic ties with Qatar over Doha's support for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. They did not sever land, sea, and air contacts with Qatar, but it did take eight months for relations to finally be restored. More recently, the Saudis and Emiratis objected to alleged remarks given by Sheikh Tamim at a commencement ceremony, in which the Qatari Emir was said to have spoken favorably of Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas while denigrating Saudi and American foreign policy. Although the Qatar News Agency reported this speech, the Qataris insist that QNA was hacked and that the speech never took place. Nonetheless, both Saudi and Emirati state media have reported on the speech and expressed anger over its contents, apparently refusing to believe Qatar's hacking explanation.
The Washington Factor
Monday's diplomatic crisis also has roots in President Donald Trump's recent visit to Riyadh. During his trip, Trump fully embraced the Saudis' anti-Iran, anti-political Islamist view of the region, and that support has emboldened the Saudis to take a harder line against Arab states that deviate from their foreign policy aims:
“You have a shift in the balance of power in the Gulf now because of the new presidency: Trump is strongly opposed to political Islam and Iran,” said Jean-Marc Rickli, head of global risk and resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy. “He is totally aligned with Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, who also want no compromise with either Iran or the political Islam promoted by the Muslim Brotherhood.”
The Trump administration has had little to say about the dispute apart from calling for dialogue and offering to mediate between the Saudis and Qataris. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that this diplomatic rupture shouldn't have “any significant impact” on U.S. counter-terrorism efforts, but it's difficult to know how he can determine that at this point. The centerpiece of Trump's Riyadh visit was supposed to be the creation of a broad coalition of Islamic states working together to combat extremism and terrorism. That coalition is already falling apart a scant two weeks after Trump's trip. The U.S. military said Monday that it has no plans to change its posture in Qatar, where the al-Udeid air base is one of U.S. Central Command's primary forward operating bases.
Additionally, it's hard to avoid connecting Monday's events with revelations over the weekend about the hacking of Yousef al-Otaiba's personal email. Emails leaked to The Intercept and Huffington Post show that Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the U.S., who was once profiled by Huffington for his “extraordinary influence” in Washington, has been lobbying the Trump administration to break America's long-standing alliance with Qatar. From Huffington's report on the leak:
In private correspondence, Otaiba ? an extremely powerful figure in Washington, D.C., who is reportedly in “in almost constant phone and email contact,” with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law ? is seen pushing for the U.S. to close down its military base in Qatar and otherwise poking at issues that could drive a wedge between the U.S. and that Arab nation. He also says that his country's de facto ruler is supportive of a wave of anti-Qatar criticism in the U.S. that the Gulf state last month called a smear campaign and that has prompted behind-the-scenes alarm inside the U.S. government.
The leaked emails also suggest that Otaiba has had a close, ongoing relationship with the pro-Israel think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), including collaboration on anti-Qatar policymaking:
The emails detail the proposed agenda of an upcoming meeting between FDD and UAE government officials that is scheduled for June 11-14. Dubowitz and Hannah are listed as attending, as well as Jonathan Schanzer, FDD vice president for research. UAE officials requested for meetings include Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince who commands the armed forces. The agenda includes extensive discussion between the two on Qatar. They are scheduled to discuss, for instance, “Al Jazeera as an instrument of regional instability.” (Al Jazeera is based in Qatar.)
On Monday afternoon, Buzzfeed's Borzhou Daragahi tweeted that “two separate sources” had told him that Monday's diplomatic moves were “driven by” that upcoming FDD/UAE conference. Given FDD's staunchly pro-Israel orientation and Qatar's ties to Hamas, this collaboration over mutual antipathy toward Doha is unsurprising.
What Happens Now
As noted above, the last time a diplomatic rupture with Qatar occurred it took eight months to repair relations. But this rupture seems more serious—for one thing, more countries are involved, and for another the countries in question have also cut off all physical contact with Qatar in addition to diplomatic contact. In the near term, it may be difficult for the Qataris to move around, to export their natural gas, and even to obtain food, since much of Qatar's imported food comes overland via the Saudi border. Indeed, there are already stories of people making runs on Qatari grocery stores.
In the longer term, it will be difficult for the Saudis and others to completely isolate Qatar internationally. The Qataris have good relations with several international and regional powers, including the U.S., but also Russia, the European Union, and Turkey, with which it has a defense agreement. And if things really get rough, Doha has a diplomatic “nuclear option,” which is to place itself under Iranian protection. Tehran has already called for a peaceful resolution to the dispute and has offered to send food to Qatar if needed. Qatar's enormous fossil fuel wealth is another factor that would make it hard to isolate the emirate for very long. It's already not clear whether any other nations will join the six that have already severed ties with Qatar. It's doubtful that even the two remaining Gulf Cooperation Council members, Kuwait and Oman, will join in.
The ultimate Saudi goal here is as yet unknown. Riyadh may want Qatar to sever its relations with Iran altogether and/or take tangible steps to divest itself of any ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. It may want Qatar to shut down Al Jazeera. Or it may want something more drastic. Last week, Salman al-Ansari, president of the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee in Washington, seemed to warn Sheikh Tamim via Twitter that he could wind up like ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi over Qatar's relations with Iran and the Saudis.
And, again, the official Saudi statement and its mention of “1995” as the year Riyadh's troubles with Doha began was not random. The Saudis are quite clearly identifying Qatar's current emir and his predecessor as the problem, and there's an unsubtle message there for others in Qatar who might be interested in finding a solution. The Saudis allegedly attempted to interfere in Qatari dynastic politics once before. In 1996, there was an attempt to place Khalifa b. Hamad Al Thani back on the Qatari throne allegedly with some level of Saudi and Emirati support. It could be that Riyadh is attempting once more to engineer a political change in Doha.

Aqqaluk Lynge has a recurring nightmare: “When I'm lying awake at night, I pray we don't find oil.” That anxiety puts Lynge, the president of Greenland's chapter of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, a group representing indigenous people from Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and Russia, in the distinct minority of his 58,000 fellow islanders, most of whom hope that a huge oil find will ensure the success of Greenland's independence from Denmark. Roughly 76 percent of the voters in a referendum last year wanted greater self-rule; on June 21 of this year, they got it.
But as part of that self-rule deal, Denmark will end up reducing its annual subsidy to Greenland—about $11,000 per person, representing about 60 percent of the island's budget. Hence the high hopes for oil revenue. Some estimates, including those of the U.S. Geological Survey, suggest Greenland's coastal waters could hold anywhere from 16 billion to 47 billion barrels of oil, or 800,000 barrels for every man, woman, and child. That would mean a staggering leap in income for Greenlanders, who until two generations ago were mostly subsistence hunters and fishermen.
With such massive potential oil reserves, Greenland is poised to achieve a geopolitical importance it hasn't had since the invention of Risk. “We don't want Greenland to be up for grabs,” worries Lynge. But oil has yet to actually be discovered, much less to flow, which is why Jens Frederiksen, the leader of Greenland's Democratic Party, spearheaded the “no” campaign during last year's referendum on self-governance. He says the government has too many pressing social needs—abysmal education levels, a crumbling public-housing stock, and massive rates of alcoholism—to reduce the Danish subsidy, especially since, even if oil is found, any revenue won't start coming in for 15 or 20 years.
DETROIT - General Motors is recalling more than 473,000 trucks and SUVs in the U.S. and Canada because the brake pedals can come loose and fail to work properly.
The recall covers certain 2015 and 2016 Chevrolet Silverado HD, GMC Sierra HD and Chevrolet Tahoe police vehicles.
GM says a nut on the brake pedal pivot mechanism can come loose, causing the pedal to loosen and possibly become inoperative.
The company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries due to the problem.
Dealers will inspect the pivot bolts. If they weren't fixed at the factory, dealers will put adhesive on the nut and retighten it. Canadian safety regulators say the problem can cause the brake lights to stay on longer than expected.
GM says the recall should begin shortly.

Woody Sauldsberry, the 60th overall selection out of the historically black Texas Southern University in the 1957 NBA draft, is the only player in history outside of the first round to win the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Nearly 60 years later, Milwaukee Bucks rookie guard Malcolm Brogdon hopes to give the ex-Philadelphia Warriors big man some company.
“I'm blessed. Whether or not I win it, I'm blessed. My mom, all that she sacrificed driving me to all the AAU practices, my brothers supporting me and all my family that has helped get me here,” Brogdon told The Undefeated.
The 2017 NBA Rookie of the Year award will have one of the odder and more lackluster races in league history.
Philadelphia 76ers rookie forward Ben Simmons, No. 1 pick of the NBA draft, did not play this season due to injury. The leading rookie scorer is Sixers center Joel Embiid, the third overall pick in the 2014 draft, who was limited to 31 games in his first season of action due to injury. The active leading rookie scorer is Sixers forward Dario Saric, a first-round pick in 2014 who is averaging 12.4 points and 6.3 rebounds in his first NBA season.
Brogdon entered Tuesday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers as the third-leading rookie scorer with 10 points per game while also ranking first among rookies in assists (4.1) and steals per game (1.15) and second in 3-point shooting percentage (40.8) and minutes per game (26.2).
Bucks coach Jason Kidd has been impressed by Brogdon's playing ability, poise and poker-faced demeanor. When asked what argument the 1994 NBA co-Rookie of the Year would give for Brodgon winning the rookie honor, Kidd told The Undefeated: “That's an easy argument. You're talking about a second-round pick playing, starting and coming off the bench that is helping the team have success and win. At the end of the day, it's about winning, but sometimes we're judged on other things. I think he should be one of the top two, if not No. 1, if he doesn't win it.”
Brogdon is one of the greatest basketball players in the University of Virginia's history. The Atlanta native was the 2016 Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and the ACC Defensive Player of the Year, becoming the first player in league history to earn both honors in the same season. The 6-foot-5, 215-pounder ranks ninth all-time in points scored at Virginia with 1,809. He averaged 18 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists as a senior during the 2015-16 season and his No. 15 jersey was retired.
Several teams said Brogdon had strong pre-draft interviews in which he told them they would land a versatile winner who could play right away, owned a team focus, loved his family and had outstanding passions and life experiences.
“Our interview with him was off the charts,” Kidd said.
The knock on Brogdon? His age. He redshirted his second season at Virginia and graduated at age 23.
“That was definitely a big piece. It's sort of the skewed way that the NBA judges talent,” Brogdon, 24, said.
Brogdon watched the draft last year in Atlanta with his family with hopes that he would be selected in the first round. The Bucks never worked out Brogdon before the draft, but selected him in the second round with the 36th overall pick. Two picks later were the Golden State Warriors, who had him listed as one of three prospects they were considering.

Brogdon's agent, David Falk, told his client that the Bucks had every intention of him being on their roster during the 2016-17 season. Milwaukee showed its belief in Brogdon, signing him to a two-year deal paying $1.8 million with a team option paying $1.05 million during the 2018-19 season. He also has $50,000 in likely bonuses this season.
Brogdon eyed the Bucks as a team that could be a good fit for him before the draft.
“Everyone wants to go higher [in the draft],” Brogdon said. “But I'd definitely pick going to the right fit, which I did, than a higher number.”
Kidd said the Bucks weren't worried about Brogdon's age.
“We were really lucky and excited that he was still there and we were able to get him,” Kidd said.
Brogdon has more than lived up to his rookie minimum salary this season as he is on pace to rank among the top rookies in most statistical categories.
Brogdon is on pace to join Larry Bird, Stephen Curry and Deron Williams as the only NBA rookies to average more than 40 percent shooting from 3-point range. Brogdon became the first rookie in Bucks history to record a triple-double with 15 points, a career-high 12 assists and 11 rebounds against the Chicago Bulls on Dec. 31, 2016. He also set Bucks rookie records for points (517), assists (229), 3-point field goal percentage (41.4), steals (65) and minutes (1,406) before the NBA All-Star break. Brogdon also garnered notice by dunking on Cleveland Cavaliers All-Stars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.
“He just knows how to play. That's what you saw at Virginia,” said Golden State Warriors assistant general manager Travis Schlenk. “I'm surprised by the way he has shot 3s. I'm not surprised that he can go out there and succeed. He knows how to play and guard and all that stuff, but he's shot the ball better than I thought he would.”
While Brogdon's early success is an NBA surprise, it wasn't a surprise for him due to his “hard work.”
“I'm a guy that works hard and believes in myself,” Brogdon said. “I have confidence in what I do. From day one I believed I could play at this level immediately, but you never know if you're going to have the opportunity. I came to the right situation. They give me plenty of opportunity.
“It's all my hard work. I believe I outwork everybody. To get to this point, I've overcome a lot of doubt and people that said I wasn't good enough, athletic enough, all types of stuff.”
The well-rounded Brogdon's amazing rise from second round to Rookie of the Year candidate is also good for his budding platform off the court.
Brogdon's father, Mitchell, is a lawyer and mediator, and his mother, Jann Adams, is Morehouse College's dean of science and math. He not only earned his bachelor's degree at Virginia, but a master's degree in public policy from the renowned Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. Brogdon and his family did not want him to leave school early for the NBA because they wanted him to complete his master's at Virginia.
“My family is educational-based,” Brogdon said. “It was important to my mom and important to me, too. It was important for me to go back and get my master's and not come out early, because we felt like the NBA would be there. Getting your master's paid for and getting it free from UVA is writing your ticket when you're done playing basketball. Basketball isn't just the end for me, it's the beginning.”
The well-traveled Brogdon is interested in creating a nongovernmental organization (NGO) to help alleviate poverty and hunger in developing nations. Given Brogdon's nicknames — “The President” and “Humble Moses” — Bucks All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo has said he can see the rookie becoming the commander in chief of the United States one day. First, Brogdon would love to play for Team World in the second NBA Africa Game on Aug. 5 in Johannesburg.
“You meet so many amazing people,” said Brogdon, after the Bucks lost to the hosting Warriors on March 18. “I met [CNN's] Van Jones on the sideline of the game. You meet so many amazing people in this arena. You have to make sure you reach out to people, connect with people so that after basketball you have options.
“People have said they see me in politics, but I'm not sure. For me, at the end of the day I want to help people and help alleviate poverty in Third World countries. That is really my dream, to go to Africa to do some work and be very active in a NGO.”
Said Kidd: “I liked the nickname ‘The Prez' because maybe one day he is.”
Whether Brogdon becomes the NBA Rookie of the Year or not, his already motivational story appears to have lots of great chapters in store on and off the hardwood.
“Just have faith in what you do,” Brogdon said. “If you have faith and work extremely hard, you give yourself a chance. With that comes a lot of opportunity, timing and luck. You give yourself a chance if you do everything the right way and you're kind to people.”

Mega Man is a video game for the Sega Game Gear. It was developed by Freestyle, licensed by Capcom, and published by U.S. Gold only in North America in 1995. Despite sharing a title with the original Mega Man on NES, it bears no relation to that title.
Gameplay [ edit ]
Mega Man is an action and platform game in the tradition of other Mega Man games. It is based on elements from the Nintendo Entertainment System versions of Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5.[2] Differences include a lack of continues (if the game is over, it restarts to the title), the addition of vertical scrolling, powerups bouncing when they hit the ground, and a hard difficulty mode (though the player has to get at least a password from this mode, since both difficulties don't share the same passwords).
The Robot Masters featured at the beginning are Bright Man, Napalm Man, Star Man, and Stone Man. Dr. Cossack's fortress contains Wave Man's and Toad Man's levels and respective bosses.[2] Wily's fortress is actually Quick Man's stage from Mega Man 2, though the player is taken to a condensed Dr. Wily stage after going through the first boss door instead. The ending features Dr. Cossack's fortress being destroyed.
Reception [ edit ]
Mega Man received an 87% from the UK-based magazine Sega Power.[3] GamePro gave the game a total score of 3.75 out of 5, complimenting its graphics and sound, but noting that the small Game Gear screen increases the difficulty.[1] 1UP.com's Nadia Oxford ellaborated, "Mega Man often has to fight with his enemies in such close quarters, he might as well hold their hands and try his luck at a friendship. The constant screen-scrolling and sticky controls makes for a very frustrating game, although the Game Gear's low battery life ends the torment in a couple of hours anyway."[4] GameSpot contributors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer described it as "a decent, if somewhat sluggish, translation of the Mega Man series".[2]
52 Tips For (DaVinci Resolve) Colorists
Today's #ColorGrading tip: Desaturating vanilla DSLR footage to about 80% (or even less) can do wonders against the video look. — Phil Strahl ? (@PhilStrahl) February 11, 2015
Twitter is a great place to learn from other colorists, and as I've done previously, here and here, I've saved you the time and hassle of trawling for tips by gathering them together in one place. Here are 52 new tips for colorists, often using Davinci Resolve but also other grading application, and obviously many of these tips will still apply, regardless of your colour correction tool of choice.
Note – some of these tips refer to earlier versions of Resolve.

If you're reading this, you've probably seen that Ultron has begun his takeover of Marvel Puzzle Quest! With so many Avengers ready to answer the call to Assemble and stop him, we thought this was the perfect time add one more classic Marvel character to our ranks - the Scarlet Witch! Like her twin brother Quicksilver, this version of Scarlet Witch is wearing her uniform from Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron! Hopefully you'll be second in line (behind me) to see the new movie and learn all about Pietro and Wanda but, while you're camped out waiting, here are some great Marvel comics to get you up to speed.
By Stan Lee & Jack Kirby
Read Sample
Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch often come in pairs, and their debut as Avengers was no exception. Captain America recruits the two reformed villains to the team, where they'd be mainstays for decades. Much like with Quicksilver, if you want to read some classic Avengers adventures with Scarlet Witch, it all starts here.
Years later, a pairing that would define both characters was the romantic relationship between Scarlet Witch and the android hero, the Vision! The two starred in a mini-series where they would eventually fall in love and get married, and it was so much fun that the following year, a 12-issue mini-series of their futher adventures came out. A lot of Wanda stories stem from the events of this series, so it's a must-read for anyone wanting to be up on their Scarlet Witchology.
By John Byrne & Mike Machlan
Did you know there used to be an Avengers team based out of Los Angeles? While the core team stayed in their Manhattan mansion, Hawkeye struck out West and formed his own team which, eventually, The Scarlet Witch would become an important member of. West Cost Avengers #42 is the start of a Scarlet Witch focused story that, again, centers around her relationship with The Vision.
By Kurt Busiek & George Pérez
When the Avengers got a reboot in the late 90's, Kurt Busiek recruited Wanda and Pietro for his new line-up, along with about half of the characters to ever get an Avengers membership card. Scarlet Witch remained a stand-out until the end of Busiek and George Perez' run, though, and in a lot of fans' eyes, this is the definitive comics version of the character.
By Allan Heinberg & Jim Cheung
After the events of Avengers: Disassembled and House of M, Scarlet Witch was missing from the Marvel Universe for years. In that time, the Young Avengers began patroling New York, including a magic-weilding teen named Wiccan and a speedster named, uh... Speed. Suspecting their connection to Wanda, they go looking for her. This story is the beginning of the Scarlet Witch's return to the Marvel Universe, and is beautifully illustrated by Jim Cheung.
By Rick Remender & John Cassaday
Recently, Wanda was part of Captain America's Avengers Unity Squad, and Uncanny Avengers #1 is the start of their battles against The Red Skull, the Apocalypse Twins and Kang in a series of stories whose repercussions can be felt in Marvel stories today. Scarlet Witch revisits her complicated relationship with Wonder Man, heals some wounds between her and Rogue, and makes amends for some past wrongs.
That brings us up to date! Hopefully after reading these stories, you're excited to get your hands on this magical powerhouse. Scarlet Witch can be earned as a prize in the Avengers Vs. Ultron event starting on April 24th! Good luck!
Trump Renews Consideration Of Military 'Safe Zones' In Syria
President Trump has revived discussion about implementing military "safe zones" in Syria, an idea from the early days of the civil war. But fencing off areas in Syria might not make sense given the current reality of the conflict, and it would be a challenge for the U.S. and its allies to put them into place.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
President Trump has brought back an old idea about intervening in the Syrian civil war. Here's what he told ABC News in his first TV interview since the inauguration.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people.
SHAPIRO: Safe zones to protect civilians in Syria - Trump says he is planning to ask the Pentagon and State Department to come up with recommendations for how the U.S. could do that. Joining us now to go over this idea is NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman here in the studio. Hi, Tom.
TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.
SHAPIRO: And also NPR's Middle East correspondent Alice Fordham on the line from Beirut. Hi, Alice.
ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Hello.
SHAPIRO: Tom, first describe what exactly these safe zones would be.
BOWMAN: A safe zone is what it sounds like. It's a piece of land that would be protected by U.S. soldiers or someone else. And you would also have to guard that piece of land from people coming in. You would also have to protect it from the air, so you would have to have a certain number of U.S. aircraft.
Now, this was raised back in 2013 by the then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey. He estimated it would cost about a billion dollars a month to create this safe zone in this piece of land somewhere in Syria.
SHAPIRO: So if this would require many more troops, aircraft, drones, that sounds like a much bigger military commitment than the U.S. has been willing to make in Syria so far.
BOWMAN: Absolutely. Right now in Syria, you have a certain number of trainers, hundreds of special operators in Syria helping the Syrian Arab rebels and also the Kurdish fighters push toward the city of Raqqa in Syria. They've been there for months now. But of course this would be a much, much larger operation, thousands of troops.
SHAPIRO: Alice, you've spent a good bit of time in Syria. Can you tell us about where these safe zones might be and how they would actually work on the ground?
FORDHAM: Sure, Ari. Well, as Tom says, this has been under discussion for many years. And as versions of this have been raised, the areas of Syria that they usually talk about are the northern strip along the border with Turkey and then the chunk in the south on the border with Jordan that is also held by rebels.
Now, in terms of how acceptable a safe zone might be to the regime and to its Russian and Iranian allies and to Turkey, which generally backs the rebels but has better relations with Russia, particularly, than it has done, there are some places where this might be more feasible than others.
For example, Turkey has already intervened in the Euphrates River Valley. It's conducted military operations there, cleared ISIS out of a few towns. And now it has Turkish-backed militias and police running a few places there. That's unlikely to have happened if Assad and his backers were really opposed to it, so a safe zone in that area might be feasible without really having to take on Russia, Iran and Assad.
But then there are other places where it's a very different story, like the province of Idlib, for example, which has some very extreme jihadi rebels fighting there and where the regime and its backers have shown no interest in pursuing anything really other than a military solution in that place.
SHAPIRO: We should say that because Donald Trump has not put out any formal guidance on this, we don't know exactly what he has in mind. Tom, when the Obama administration considered this, what did they conclude?
BOWMAN: Well, they concluded it was very difficult to do. The Pentagon, again, pushed back on this. They said it would cost billions of dollars. It would take thousands of troops. People like Senator John McCain really wanted to do this, was leaning forward on this, but the Obama administration decided it was too difficult to do. So they kind of scrapped it.
And this has been discussed really, again, for the past three and a half years. It keeps coming up every few months. It came up during the campaign. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump suggested safe zones, no-fly zones. But again, it hasn't happened yet because of the difficulty.
SHAPIRO: One thing that I don't understand, Alice - if these safe zones might well be on the border of Turkey or the border of Lebanon or Jordan, why can't the Turks, the Lebanese, the Jordanians do this? Why do the Americans need to get involved in such a large way?
FORDHAM: Well, to a certain extent, they already have, Ari. Actually, over the past year or so, Turkey and Jordan have really closed their borders much more tightly to refugees in a way that has been criticized by some people as being rather inhumane. But that does mean that actually the flow of refugees out of these countries is much lower.
In fact, if the goal of this exercise is to reduce the number of Syrian refugees that exist in the world outside Syria, you'd have to create zones that are so safe that people who are currently Syrian refugees would be happy to actually go back inside Syria. And speaking to refugees who are very afraid of the situation there, that would require a real sea change in what's happening in Syria.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Alice Fordham speaking with us from Beirut and also Tom Bowman here in the studio. Thanks to both of you.
BOWMAN: You're welcome.
FORDHAM: Thanks for having me.

During my six-year marriage to an amazing man, I have had a cordial relationship with his mother. I am now pregnant with his family's first grandchild. My husband and I mutually decided that we didn't want to know the sex before the birth.
My mother-in-law was livid with our decision, even though I tried to placate her by using the obstetrician she suggested and allowing her to attend some of my prenatal appointments. She continued to bring up gender at every opportunity.
My doctor's staff was aware of our decision not to know the baby's sex, but after one sonogram I was surprised to see my mother-in-law at the office smiling ear to ear. A few days later I had messages from family members congratulating me on the baby girl I was having! It turns out my mother-in-law wheedled the information out of the ultrasound technician, who is a friend of hers, then announced it. I threatened the clinic with legal action and found a new doctor mid-pregnancy.
My mother-in-law is smug about her tactics and told me nastily that if I “still had a mother” I wouldn't be so selfish. (I was orphaned at age 14.)
I can't express how betrayed and hurt I am by this. My husband sides with me and we've made a birthing plan that includes her not being permitted in the facility until we've been released. We will not inform anyone of the birth until after we're home, and for the time being, she won't be welcome to visit.
Am I being too vengeful here? How do I overcome this feeling of betrayal?
Advice from Slate columnist Emily Yoffe (aka 'Dear Prudence')
I guess you could consider yourself lucky your mother-in-law didn't pop out of the closet while you and your husband were trying to conceive, like one of those terrifying mothers in the Old Spice commercials. But how utterly unnerving to have found her lurking at your doctor appointment.
After the technician violated your privacy, you were right to have found another practitioner. It should also be comforting that this obstetrician understands your mother-in-law needs to be treated as a security risk.
Advertisement
Thank goodness your husband is standing firm with you. Too often, I hear about sons of such mothers who have been trained since childhood to give in to these termagants, and who find it easier even in adulthood to avoid the drama and accede to their demands.
Your mother-in-law grew up in an era in which everyone had to wait for the baby to be born in order to find out its sex, so it's bizarre that she's obsessed with a piece of information that was to be revealed soon enough. But your mother-in-law has proven herself unable to distinguish between her desires and someone else's; given her remark to you about your deceased mother, she is also cruel and insensitive.
Your husband should explain to his mother that because of her behaviour during your pregnancy, you two are on hiatus from her. Say that it would be sad not to have her in your child's life, but if she wants to enjoy being a grandmother, a basic requirement is that she treat her daughter-in-law with respect. An apology from her and a recognition she needs to do better would be a start. But in the absence of that, after the baby is born and you feel ready, allow her some short visits to see if she seems capable of reform. You're not being vengeful; she's the one who has to regain your trust.
And please don't let her terrible behaviour make you engage in a stealth birth. You and your husband shouldn't feel that becoming parents is something to keep clandestine.

Question: How do you know when the contest is not officially "over," but the outcome is no longer in doubt?
Answer: How would I know? I was a Huckabee guy.
Advertisement
With apologies to the Sage of St. Louis, there comes a time when it ain't over, but ... it's over. There comes a time in a relationship when a woman will still answer your phone calls, but you're wasting your money buying flowers; you know what I'm saying? There comes a moment during a job interview when you're still talking, but you might as well take off your shoes. There is a time in an illness when you're not dead yet, but you might as well stop taking that nasty medicine.
There is a line there somewhere, and how do you know when the line is crossed that separates hope from fantasy? If we're talking politics, romance, job interviews, or medicine, I don't know. When it comes to college basketball, I've got a theory.
This thing has a 40-year history, actually. I've been attending basketball games at Allen Field House in Lawrence, Kan. (home of the Jayhawks), since 1967. The Jayhawks usually win by 15 or 20 points, and sometime in about 1968 I started wondering whether there wasn't some way to decide when the game was no longer in doubt. I began to experiment with heuristic inventions to try to find the moment at which the line was crossed. A heuristic could be loosely defined as a mathematical rule that works even though no licensed mathematician would be caught dead associating with it.
Let's see ... what about: The game is over when the number of points you are ahead (or behind) is more than one-tenth the number of seconds left in the game? *
Advertisement
Nah, that doesn't work. If you're 30 points behind, the game is over much more than five minutes out (300 seconds); if you're two points behind, the game is not over when there are 20 seconds left. The rule doesn't work on either end.
Eventually I found a rule that did work at that time, but at that time there was no 3-point shot in basketball. When they added the 3-point line, I had to recalibrate my system.
OK, I've stalled as long as I can. Are you ready?
Take the number of points one team is ahead.
Subtract three.
Add a half-point if the team that is ahead has the ball, and subtract a half-point if the other team has the ball. (Numbers less than zero become zero.)
Square that.
If the result is greater than the number of seconds left in the game, the lead is safe.
Advertisement
(If you don't have a calculator handy, use the tool below to do the calculations for you.)
If you've got a 10-point lead and the ball with 10 minutes left, is that a safe lead?
Of course not; teams come back from a 10-point deficit all the time. A 10-point lead, plus the ball, gives you a 7.5-point safety margin. It's safe for 56.25 seconds—56, rounded down. With 600 seconds to play, a 10-point lead (with the ball) is 9 percent safe. That doesn't mean a team with a 10-point lead and the ball with 10 minutes to go has only a 9 percent chance of winning. Rather, it means they're 9 percent of the way to having a completely insurmountable advantage.
An 11-point lead with nine minutes to play—we'll let you keep the ball. That's an 8.5-point safety margin with 540 seconds to play; it's 13 percent safe (72.25 divided by 540).
Advertisement
A 12-point lead with eight minutes to play ... that's a 9.5 point margin. It's 19 percent safe (90.25 divided by 480).
A 13-point lead with seven minutes to play ... 26 percent safe.
A 16-point lead with four minutes to play ... 76 percent safe, assuming the team with the lead also has the ball. It's really unusual for a team to come from 16 back with four to play and win, but it does happen. I would guess it happens twice a year somewhere in the world of college basketball.
A 17-point lead with three minutes to play ... bingo. That's a safe lead. Seventeen points with three minutes to play is a safe lead whether you have the ball or not, actually; a 17-point lead with the ball is safe at 3:30; a 17-point lead without the ball is safe at 3:02.
Advertisement
Once a lead is safe, it's permanently safe, even if the score tightens up. You're down 17 with three to play; you can make a little run, maybe cut it to 8 with 1:41 to play. The lead, if it was once safe, remains safe. The theory of a safe lead is that to overcome it requires a series of events so improbable as to be essentially impossible. If the "dead" team pulls back over the safety line, that just means that they got some part of the impossible sequence—not that they have a meaningful chance to run the whole thing.
Why calculate when the lead is safe? The real answer is "because I like to." I like to feel that I understand little things about sports. I like to feel that I can see the difference between a safe lead and a live contest for the same reason that I like to feel that I can recognize a zone defense and recognize a pick-and-roll.
But if that answer doesn't work for you ... you pay a price in sports for anything you believe that is not true. The fact is that everybody around a college basketball game—the coaches, the announcers, even the referees at a lower level—calculates when the game is really over. They calculate it with intuition and guesswork. When the lead is judged to be safe, the coaches empty the bench. When the lead is judged to be safe, the announcers start re-ranking the top 25 and talking about the upcoming games or the next-round matchups. When the lead is safe, the Jayhawk fans start doing the slow, spooky Rock Chalk chant. I love that.
If a coach misjudges the moment at which the lead is safe, he can empty the bench too early and get himself into trouble. I've never actually seen a coach lose a game that way, but I certainly have seen coaches misjudge when the lead is safe, empty the bench too early, and get hit by a haymaker. More commonly, because coaches are afraid that that might happen, they continue to compete after the game is beyond any reasonable possibility of a reversal. That has consequences, too. You can get a player hurt playing for nothing. You can miss the opportunity to get a little bit of rest for players who are tired at the end of the season but have a game on Saturday. You can miss the opportunity to get that 12th man his 20 seconds in an NCAA tournament game—and if there's no value in that, then why do they do it?
Advertisement
And I think we've all seen games in which the announcers misjudged the moment when the lead was safe and started talking about the consequences of an outcome that was never to be. Probably announcers don't enjoy doing that.
I have never personally seen a game in which a team lost after having a safe lead. In February 1994, LSU led Kentucky by 31 with 15:30 left to play, only to see Kentucky rally for a 99-95 victory. That was impressive, but a 31-point lead without the ball is safe for 12:36. The lead was 81 percent safe. And then this year, LSU blew a 15-point lead to Villanova with 2:59 to go—which, again, is close but no kewpie doll. With 179 seconds to play you need a 13.5-point margin, which means a 16-point lead with the ball or 17 without. The curse of Dale Brown. Actually, I would guess Dale was cursing up a storm when that happened.
My editor, doing his due diligence, found one game in which a team lost after holding a safe lead. On March 2, 1974, North Carolina trailed Duke, 86-78, with 17 seconds to play—a safe lead for Duke. Duke had repeated misadventures in in-bounding the basketball and wound up losing the game in overtime. That was before the human typo was hired to coach Duke, but ... does anybody know where I could get a tape of that game?
My little formula, over the course of 40 years, has wormed its way into our family's college basketball experience. Early on in every game, usually once in the first half when the score is about 23-21 and again midway through the second half, I will observe soberly, in my best faux-expert voice, that "the lead is not safe," and my wife will look at me not only as if I were an idiot, but as if for some reason she is surprised by this. In the closing minutes of a tense game, it gets serious: "Is that it? Is the lead safe yet, Dad? How much more?" They are waiting to exhale, waiting to unbundle their nerves. They know that every time the clock stops, when I should be scoping out the cheerleaders, I am recalculating the lead in the back of my head. I've been doing it so long, I can do both at the same time.
I hope you get something out of it.
And if you do, tell Ralph Nader. It's over, man. Go home.
RM Sotheby's has played host to the most exquisite automobiles of the world since its very existence, its auctions are impressive display of automobiles in equally compelling surrounding. Their upcoming auction to be held on June 24, 2017 in Santa Monica is no different, it will be held in the presence of one of the most iconic custom built Hot Rod.
The Lincoln Zephyr is possibly the best blend of retro looks and modern design. The instantly recognisable front end of the 1930's Lincoln Zephyr is stretched out and widened, to build on the already beautiful design concept. The exquisitely shaped front nose is the perfect balance of being pointed and having a smooth curve. The design of the car swoops lower towards the rear starting out from a tall front section. All this design brilliance doesn't come easily, it is the product of 4500 hours of painstaking labour, the car was initially a barn find. Terry Cook who is the designer of the Scrape custom is a huge disciple of the original designers of Lincoln Zephyr. The most interesting part of the build is the grafting of the 1941 Zephyr nose onto the 1939 Zephyr rear. The custom features 1939 Ford headlights, wider fenders, a custom rear window opening, and a heavily chopped swooping roof. The Lincoln Zephyr Scrape custom features modern internals making it future proof, it includes a Chevrolet frame, chevy 350 small block V8s, automatic 3 speed transmission. The interiors are tastefully finished in tuck and roll black and white, Zephyr Banjo steering wheel, Cadillac split bench power seats, air conditioning, power windows, power steering, power brakes and even features airbags.
Its introduction in 1998 saw the Zephyr ‘Scrape' custom become an instant international phenomenon. The Zephyr Scrape custom was the main attraction of more than 20 premier car shows since then, it even featured on the cover of the 1998 issue of Street Rodder magazine. The design of the car gathered such a huge fan following that Mattel created a 1/18 scale Hot Wheels version of the car. Also the Zephyr Scrape shouldn't be mistaken for a show car, as a proof the car's usability on the road, it was taken on a 3500 mile shakedown cruise after receiving a $60,000 mechanical work. All the practicality, future proofing and reliability of the Lincoln Zephyr Scrape custom has extended the brilliant design of the car to be enjoyed not just in a garage or an auto show but also on road trips.

Deep Learning is a form of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that utilizes multiple hidden layers of a Neural Network stacked on top of each other in order to attempt to form a deeper “understanding” about the data.
Recently, deep neural networks have had a lot of exposure on the web in the form of “Deep Dreams”, or as it was called in the original article on Google research: Inceptionism.
In this article we'll be going over several frameworks, libraries and tools for Deep Learning for several purposes.
Deep Learning in Python
Theano
Homepage: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/
Github URL: https://github.com/Theano/Theano
Theano is not only the backbone library to a lot of other frameworks which will be discussed in this article, but also a great library to use on its own in almost any situation where you'd want to perform anything ranging from a simple Logistic Regression all the way to Modeling and generating sequences of polyphonic music or using a long short term memory network to classify movie ratings.
Theano is largely written in Cython, a Python dialect that compiles to native executable code, which provides a large speed boost compared to using only the interpreted Python language. On top of that, a lot of optimizations have been built into theano in order to optimize the flow of your computations and keep your runtime to a bare minimum.
If that speed boost isn't quite enough for you yet, it also has built-in support for performing all those time consuming calculations on your GPU using CUDA. All this does not require anything more than switching a single configuration flag. To run a script on the CPU and then switch over to the GPU does not require any changes in your code.
Also note that even though Theano uses Cython and CUDA for its large performance boosts, you can create almost any type of neural network architecture using only Python code.
Pylearn2
Homepage: http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/
Github URL: https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2
Made by the same developers as Theano, Pylearn2 is a library that wraps a lot of models and training algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent that are commonly used in Deep Learning and AI research into a single package to experiment with.
You could also write wrappers around your own classes and algorithms quite easily in order to implement these in Pylearn2 and configure the parameters of your entire neural network model from a single YAML configuration file.
Aside from that it also has a lot of datasets and their preparation already built into the package so you can start experimenting with the MNIST dataset straight away!
Blocks
Github URL: https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks
Blocks is a very modular framework that helps you build neural network models on top of Theano. Currently it supports and provides:
Constructing parametrized Theano operations, called “bricks”
Pattern matching to select variables and bricks in large models
Algorithms to optimize your model
Saving and resuming of training
Monitoring and analyzing values during training progress (on the training set as well as on test sets)
Application of graph transformations, such as dropout
Keras
Homepage: http://keras.io/
Github URL: https://github.com/fchollet/keras
Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural network library in the spirit of Torch, written in Python, that uses Theano under the hood for optimized tensor manipulation on GPU and CPU. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and creation of new Deep Learning models.
Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:
allows for easy and fast prototyping (through total modularity, minimalism, and extensibility).
supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
supports arbitrary connectivity schemes (including multi-input and multi-output training).
What separates Keras from the other libraries that use Theano is that Keras is written in a very minimalist and clean style. Wrapping up all the essentials in small classes that can easily be pieced together to create entirely new models.
Lasagne
Github URL: https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne
Not just a very tasty Italian dish, but also a Deep Learning Library which has about the same features as Blocks or Keras, but follows a bit of a different design.
Here are some of Lasagne's design goals:
Simplicity : it should be easy to use and extend the library. Whenever a feature is added, the effect on both of these should be considered. Every added abstraction should be carefully scrutinized, to determine whether the added complexity is justified.
: it should be easy to use and extend the library. Whenever a feature is added, the effect on both of these should be considered.

Relatively new compared to some other libraries on this list but buzzing with development activity.
This library also supports CUDA for running your models on the GPU, but does not rely on Theano to do so. It has instead its own implementation.
Chainer supports various network architectures including feed-forward nets, convnets, recurrent nets and recursive nets. It also supports per-batch architectures.
Chainer looks extremely promising due to the way it builds its computational graph, which differs from the way one declares a model in e.g. Theano or Torch7. This strategy also makes it easy to write multi-GPU parallelization, since logic comes closer to network manipulation.

In Sunday's article about how to save money by cutting the cable or satellite cord, Mike Ness of Ness Electronics in Burnsville discussed some of the benefits of getting rid of cable or satellite and taking advantage of the free digital and high-definition channels over the airwaves.
Several readers online commented that despite savings of more than $1,000 per year by eliminating satellite or cable, they still have issues with getting KARE 11, weather affecting reception, and other problems with spotty reception.
If you're a cable cutter who installed your own antenna and you're still having the problems above, consider hiring a professional antenna installer. John Brillhart of Cable Alternatives, who specializes in helping cord cutters with antennas and streaming, said, "We've done hundreds of installs in the Twin Cities and KARE 11 has never been a station we've struggled with." He said he's done antenna installs as far north as Sartell, Minn. with no KARE issues.
If you're experiencing signal issues during rain, snow or high winds, it's time to reposition or get a new antenna, Brillhart said. "Weather events can downgrade signal, no doubt, but in the metro area, the signal is strong enough to overcome your run of the mill snowstorm or thunderstorm with a good antenna install," he said.
If you hire an antenna specialist, consider one who uses a meter to measure signal strength and quality. Ask about a signal guarantee. Cable Alternatives charges $75 for a service call and about $350 if you need an outdoor antenna.
In the Twin Cities, there are installers to help with antenna installs and trouble shooting such as Cable Alternatives (763-571-1037), Mr. HDTV Man (651-592-3907) or Enhanced Home Technology (763-262-0202, serving western and northwestern suburbs).In the St. Cloud area, it's Minnesota Electronics (320-251-2951) and in the Hutchinson area, it's Electronic Servicing (320-327-2742).
MItt Romney policy director Lanhee Chen
“The study analyzes only half of Governor Romney's tax program, ignoring the reforms that would make America's corporations more competitive by moving from the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world to one that is comparable to our trading partners. And the study ignores the positive benefits to economic growth from both the corporate tax plan and the deficit reduction called for in the Romney plan. These glaring gaps invalidate the report's conclusions.”
Mitt Romney has been calling the Tax Policy Center's demolition of his tax proposal biased. His complaint in a nutshell: You liberals don't take into account the flurry of economic growth that will take place if only we chop taxes. Lanhee Chen, Romney's policy director, wasn't specific in his gripes about the center's claims that the proposal—a rich guy's wet dream the candidate dares to call tax "reform"—would increase taxes for 95 percent of Americans:Chen also argues that you can't expect objectivity from a study drafted by a former member of the Obama economic team. But he doesn't point out, as Benjy Sarlin does, that another author of the study was part of George H. W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
Romney's proposal, which would make a 20 percent across the board income-tax cut supposedly paid for by eliminating deductions, has never had specifics attached to it. And that made it tough for the Tax Policy Center to decide what its impact would be. So it created a best-case scenario favorable to Romney. Even then, however, its analysis showed the beneficiaries would be the top 5 percent of the population. Everybody else would see their after-tax income fall.
Chen says, however, that because study didn't include a proposed cut in the corporate tax that will supposedly usher in an economic boom. There are believers and skeptics on that score. The biggest problem comes from analyses not of Romney's future plans but of what has happened in the recent past, namely the Bush tax cuts. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, as explained in Romney's new tax cuts would work just like the Bush tax cuts: Enhance economic inequality, found that over a nine-year period those cuts poured the bulk of the benefits into the coffers of the already wealthy.
That upward skew generated no boom. As you may have noticed.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Niagara Parks Police said accidents of this kind were ''pretty rare''
An exchange student from Japan is presumed dead after being swept over Niagara Falls on Sunday night, authorities say.
The woman, in her 20s, who was studying in Toronto, climbed onto a pillar overlooking the Canadian side of the falls and slipped over, police said.
She then fell into the Niagara River about 80ft (24m) up from the edge of the falls and was swept over.
The Niagara Parks Police described the death as a tragic accident.
As of Monday morning, the woman's body had not been recovered. Officials said they were working with the Japanese consulate to notify her family.
"The public is reminded that climbing over this wall is clearly dangerous and is prohibited by the Niagara Parks Act and its regulations," Niagara Parks Police Chief Doug Kane warned.
"Millions of visitors have viewed the scenic Niagara falls and the Niagara River gorge while respecting the safety wall without incident."
The accident, which occurred about 20:30 local time (00:30 GMT) on Sunday at Table Rock near the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, was captured on CCTV.
The woman, who was visiting with a friend, had been taking a photograph, then climbed onto a pillar holding an umbrella before standing up for a clearer view, police said.
She lost her footing as she tried to climb down from a block pillar and tumbled into the fast-moving river, police said.
Earlier reports said only that the woman was visiting from Toronto but did not specify she was Japanese.
While the woman's body had yet to be found on Monday, searchers did turn up an unidentified male body at the base of the falls.
Local authorities were working to identify that corpse, police said.
Candidates for mayor expressed near-unanimous endorsement of protected bike lanes at a transportation forum Tuesday night, while also criticizing a plan to build streetcars along Nicollet Avenue.
The forum at the University of Minnesota, sponsored by various bicycle and urbanist groups, featured five of the top eight mayoral candidates. Mark Andrew, Jackie Cherryhomes and Don Samuels did not attend.
Candidates were asked to weigh in on the Minneapolis Climate Action Plan's goal of adding 30 miles of protected bike ways in Minneapolis by 2020. The issue has been controversial lately as bicycling advocates fight for more cycle tracks -- which include barriers between bikes and general traffic.
Council Member Betsy Hodges said bicycle infrastructure is important for people like her, who are not avid, year-round cyclists. “Protected bikeways are important. Not everybody is a comfortable cyclist," Hodges said.
Stephanie Woodruff also said she was a cyclist, though not an avid one. "I live on Franklin between 1st [Avenue] and Stevens, and I personally would not ride down 1st Avenue. I've seen cars, I've seen people get hit. It's just not safe," Woodruff said.
All others expressed general support for the plan except Cam Winton, who stressed that he supports cycle tracks on a "case by case" basis. “Whenever anybody proposes any new spending, I look at that request, that proposal, with healthy skepticism," Winton said. He said bicycling advocates have convinced him that cycle tracks are wise along Washington and Minehaha Avenues -- the latter of which will likely not be happening.
On streetcars, Hodges was the lone person on stage endorsing the plan as it stands -- to pay for a $200 million "starter" streetcar line by redirecting more than $60 million in property taxes from existing projects. Woodruff opposed the funding method, while Bob Fine, Dan Cohen and Winton opposed streetcars altogether.
Woodruff was asked what funding method she would favor over the so-called "value capture district" approved by the City Council.
“I completely support value capture," Woodruff said. "It's just that this deal…is not a true value capture. In my mind this is tax diversion, because it's taking the taxes of those units that are already in development."
She said the project should be funded by development spurred by the streetcar line. That would be more akin to tax increment financing, which the city fought for unsuccessfully at the Legislature to use instead.
Other questions touched on parking, pedestrian activity and potholes. Winton garnered applause, and a Twitter nod from Council Member Gary Schiff, for saying, "Minneapolis should entire eliminate minimum parking requirements." That refers to mandates for developers to include parking in new residential properties.
Virginia Tech enters bowl season in the unusual position of being 6 and 6 and playing former Big East whipping boy Rutgers. As I said before the Sugar Bowl last year, besides national perception, any bowl game besides the BCS National Championship has been rendered rather meaningless. The benefit comes from the extra practice sessions for Frank Beamer's squad, which (according to Andy Bitter) he has correctly utilized to get meaningful work for young players that will need to produce next season. When Alabama rolls into the Georgia Dome, the Hokies chances of victory will depend heavily on contributions from players like Trey Edmunds (who has wowed the coaches in bowl prep practices based on Beamer's comments), Demetri Knowles, Laurence Gibson, Mark Shuman, Ronny Van Dyke, and the young defensive backs. Hopefully, the rotation for the bowl game makes sure that the non-redshirts get meaningful snaps to prepare for a big 2013.
At the same time, the game presents opportunities which make winning important. Most significantly, it gives Virginia Tech to end the year on a positive note at the same time when Mike London's Wahoos are mired in a recruiting malaise on the eve of the largest recruiting haul in Virginia high school history. A win, in a nationally televised game, against a team from a state where Virginia Tech has made some recruiting inroads, not only kicks off a successful recruiting cycle, but also kicks more dirt on their in-state pseudo-rivals. Mike London's tears are a beautiful thing.
Offense
Rutgers had a terrific season, but their offense is not particularly exciting or dangerous. They averaged only 22.4 points per game against a relatively weak schedule. Rutgers quarterback (Gary Nova) has a very similar skill set to former QB Michael Rocco. Rutgers basically uses their wide receivers to run go routes, and Nova throws the ball up when they are single covered.
Both receivers are huge (6'5"-6'6"), especially #17 Brandon Colemon (39 receptions 663 yards 10 touchdowns) and play the ball at the highest point. They are not good route runners. It will be a tough matchup if the Hokies play man and don't have safety help over the top if Nova is accurate with his delivery.
Underneath, Nova likes to quickly move to the check down if his primary read is not covered man to man. Expect a ton of throws to backs and tight ends. Nova does not have a strong arm, and if the Hokies can render those big receivers ineffective by getting pressure to force inaccurate throws, Nova will have trouble. We have seen that gameplan work against UVA, but Pitt's big receivers gave the Hokies fits. Also, like Rocco, Nova has a tendency to panic and try to throw the ball away in play when pressured. He threw several interceptions where he didn't have a receiver in the area.
The key to the game will be the Hokies ability to stop the run. Rutgers uses a one back set, and almost exclusively uses a zone blocking scheme. The Knights depend on the running game to setup positive down and distance situation, as the passing game is not designed to be particularly effective in 3rd-and-long. In the past, Bud Foster's scheme was most effective against zone blocking, but Boston College and Pitt both ran the ball effectively by using zone design, but sealing off the backside end and backer and the back using a designed cutback. Tailback Jawan Jamison rushed for over a thousand yards this season, but he looked fairly average on film. An ankle injury hobbled him down the stretch.
To that point, the Scarlet Knights were 8-1 and Jamison was averaging 105.7 rushing yards per game and 23.8 carries per game. Following the injury -- with Rutgers going 1-2 -- he averaged 34.3 yards and 9.3 carries, managing a combined 103 yards over the final three games.
Two backup running backs got most of the snaps against Cincinnati, and they were largely ineffective. However, Jamison claims he is healthy.
"I feel like I'm back right now," he said. "I feel like I'm running well, I'm moving well, I've got my moves back. I can cut, plant and burst out, so I feel like this is definitely a redemption game for me."
I anticipate that the running game will be the deciding factor in the football game. If Rutgers can run the football effectively, it will allow Nova to use his backs and tight ends to move the sticks on 3rd and short yardage. If the Hokies can hold Rutgers running game in check, I do not think that Nova can stand back in the pocket in the face of Bud Foster's designer blitzes and avoid making critical mistakes. In those situations, Nova will either throw underneath coverage and accept punting as a less risky strategy, or Nova will look to have one read, identify single coverage, and try to throw jump balls the Rutgers massive wide receivers.
Defense
Rutgers' strength is their defensive front seven. They play a defensive system up-front similar to Virginia Tech, in that each player has an individual gap responsibility. On film, most of their defenses look like a traditional 4-3, but unlike a traditional 4-3, Rutgers uses two middle linebackers who have interior gap responsibility before scraping to the football. Their best defensive player is middle linebacker, number 20, Khaseem Greene. He is a real heavy hitter on the interior, and excels in handling the guard-center gap, beating the block of the interior lineman, and making the tackle for minimal game. He is not particularly quick going sideline to sideline and is much stronger moving straight ahead. He is a very similar player to Jack Tyler.
While Rutgers schemes similar gap responsibilities with the d-line and linebackers as Bud Foster's defense, they use very different methods to accomplish gap integrity. Rutgers very rarely stunts, however they use a wide variety of defensive looks, and then at the first sound, they change to a different front in an effort to confuse the defense. Often, this gives Green or one of the defensive tackles an unblocked route to the running back. In the Cincinnati film, I identified 7-8 different defensive fronts used against the spread.
Often, they line up in a 4-3, but the strong-side outside linebacker plays over the tight end on the line of scrimmage, while one defensive tackle "eagles" (plays inside eye of the center) as a true nose, with the other linemen in an alignment that looks similar to a 3-4. On other plays, Rutgers will remove a defensive lineman and play four linebackers, with one lined up as an "elephant man" (a stand-up defensive end similar to Charles Haley and Rickey Jackson of NFL lore.) They also use a base four-man front, but both the mike and willy backer both maintain interior gap responsibilities. This makes Rutgers very sound against the run, but they have difficulty generating pass rush from a base four-man front.
Against the pass, Rutgers front seven uses variable looks and stunts to get pressure.
Here is an example. Cincinnati faces a 3rd and 8 early in the game. Rutgers uses one free safety, and presses three defensive backs to the field side. The boundary corner plays off 7 yards, angled in looking at the QB to attempt to bait him into throwing a slant route that he can jump. Rutgers shows blitz with both backers, but drops one into coverage while the other runs a dog blitz through the zero gap while the strong side defensive tackle loops behind him. Under pressure, the inexperience QB throws a quick read, but both slot receivers were pushed off their routes by effective press techniques. The QB fails to see the linebacker (Ward) who drops from his blitzing position and steps right in front of the throw.
Defensive tackle/nose Scott Vallone #94 gets penetration and can make plays, but they are in essence a mediocre ACC group. Linebackers run to the football. Middle linebacker Khaseme Green is a stud. The one-gap scheme requires Green to fill gaps, shed a blocker, and make tackles, and on almost every play he wins his one on one matchup with centers and guards. He is the best linebacker the Hokies have played since Kevin Reddick (and that didn't end well for Virginia Tech.) He presents a huge challenge for the interior of the offensive line, and the Hokies must establish the tailback/slot back on the read option in order to get him out of the middle, creating space for Logan Thomas.
While Rutgers front uses multiple looks, the secondary played almost the same defense throughout against the Bearcats. The Scarlet Knights lined up in press coverage, with the strong safety on the slot and the free safety playing 15 yards deep. Rutgers seems to use a boundary corner concept, so the corners switch sides with one always playing the boundary. Against Cincinnati, Rutgers played a press coverage look throughout the game, but there are not really lockdown guys. Their goal is to mess up the timing of the route and then prevent the big play, and hope the front can generate a poor throw. Pitt had success with play-action and moving the pocket, and hitting 7-10 yard passes underneath deep man coverage. When Rutgers went zone, Pitt's big receivers got "lost" between the safety and corner for big plays. (See Hokies using waggle and throw-back.) Against Cincinnati's spread offense, Rutgers used press coverage and dared the Bearcats' QB to beat them over the top. Instead, the Bearcats threw underneath routes, and had success hitting slot guys and running backs in man against the Rutgers middle linebackers. Neither linebacker is particularly good at man coverage, although you don't want to lead a receiver into their area when they are in zone.
Prediction
This is a tricky game to predict. Based on the film I have watched, Rutgers looks to be an ideal matchup for Virginia Tech's defense. A shaky QB, so-so offensive line, and the zone scheme made me think of Michael Rocco in panic mode. The big wide receivers present a problem, but Nova's inaccuracy under pressure can mitigate those concerns. On offense, Virginia Tech will need a big day passing the football, and I envision them attacking Rutgers in the middle of the field. I anticipate a big day from Corey Fuller and J.C. Coleman if Logan Thomas can be accurate with the football. I don't like the Hokie offense running the football in this matchup, but if they are successful, it will be because they establish the edge and wear out Green moving laterally in order to open up the middle.
For you Vegas-types, I think the safest bet will be the under. I would be stunned if either team scores over 25 points. I think Virginia Tech has more game-breaking talent, and one play will likely make the difference, and Rutgers was not able to make a big play against Pitt or Cincinnati. Expect a Virginia Tech victory.
Prediction: Virginia Tech 17 Rutgers 13
WWE superstar Roman Reigns has been suspended 30 days for an undisclosed violation of the company's wellness policy. (0:24)
WWE superstar Roman Reigns, whose legal name is Joe Anoa'i, was suspended Tuesday for violating the company's talent wellness policy. The 30-day suspension, which is effective immediately, is Anoa'i's first violation of a policy that was implemented by the WWE in February 2006.
There was no mention of the specific violation by either the WWE or Anoa'i in their respective statements, though both parties commented on the matter via Twitter.
I apologize to my family, friends and fans for my mistake in violating WWE's wellness policy. No excuses. I own it. - Roman Reigns (@WWERomanReigns) June 21, 2016
This wellness suspension is the third penalty of its kind that WWE has issued in 2016. In April, the company suspended Raymond Leppan (Adam Rose) and Ryan Parmeter (Konnor) for 60 days each for their second violations of the policy. Leppan subsequently requested and was granted his release.
As Reigns, Anoa'i is a three-time WWE world heavyweight champion, a one-time WWE tag-team champion and the 2015 Royal Rumble winner. He also played college football at Georgia Tech from 2003 to 2006, where he was a three-year starter at defensive tackle.

OK, so I did vote after all, my lofty apathy indifference of three weeks ago notwithstanding. It was my son that sent me off to the polling booth.
Danny Derbyshire has for years had his heart set on joining the Army. A high-school senior, he encountered a recruiter back in September, and the recruiter reeled him in without much difficulty. I”ve warned the lad that when the wooing stops and he's just another grunt in uniform, there”ll be some psychological letdown, but he declares himself unbothered.
Danny took the AFQT (basically an IQ test: the cutoff for the Army is IQ 92) and the ASVAB (a vocational test to see which military specialty suits you). A smart kid”it's genetic“Danny aced both tests and is in A-1 physical condition, so they basically told him he could pick his own specialty. He picked Airborne Rangers, the most dangerous specialty on the list. They jump out of planes to do Navy-SEAL-type super-hazardous missions.
“It was all for naught. As I write, shortly after midnight on Wednesday morning, it is clear that Barack Obama has won another term.”
I was thrilled. Mrs. D., however, had a conniption. The traditional prejudice of the Chinese is that “å¥½éµä¸æé, å¥½å ä¸ç¶å µ”””You don”t use good iron to make nails, a good son does not become a soldier.” My wife had just recently overcome this ancestral wisdom and reconciled herself to the lad having a military career, but she had taken comfort in the thought that he would enter some safe specialty”military intelligence, perhaps, sitting at a PC screen in a cube deciphering information from the field. That her son might actually be the field was too much for her.
We talked Mom most of the way down from her ledge, but she was still adamant that if Danny got killed on active service, she would divorce me. I consigned to that, Danny went off for an overnight stay at Fort Hamilton (more physicals, some kind of preliminary oath), and he can now proceed straight from high-school graduation next summer to Fort Benning for boot camp. From there he goes to Ranger school, which has a sensational washout rate.
I am reliably informed by a Texas friend”in Texas everybody has a family member in the military”that Ranger school washouts get all the crap jobs in the Army. I passed this on to my son, but he was unfazed. “I”ll qualify.” As temperamentally hostile as I am to every form of facile optimism, I admired my son's resolution.
(The only other conservative I know with a son in the military is Peter Brimelow of VDARE.com, whose son Alexander is currently serving with the US Marine Corps in Afghanistan. On the basis of this admittedly tiny sample, I”d suggest that if you want to meet a conservative with a military-minded kid, go to the dissident right. Bigfoot mainstream-conservative pundits send their kids to law school.)

It's been almost three months since Mike Tyson announced that he had gone vegan — a drastic change in diet that many thought was a publicity stunt for the former heavyweight champion.
It was hard to believe it was for anything but all the wrong reasons. After all, Tyson had just come under fire from PETA for his new reality pigeon racing TV series, "Taking on Tyson", on Animal Planet. Surely, he was just trying to get a little attention with the whole "vegan" thing, right?
Or not.
“It's been eight months with this vegan stuff," Tyson recently told Details magazine, "but I get these explosions of energy. I don't know how long they last, but they're like explosions. So powerful.”
“I ate, like, the tiniest piece of meat, and I woke up violently sick,” he added. “It was vicious pain. I was throwing up. And I realized meat's become a poison for me now.”
At the time of his vegan coming-out party, Tyson told USA Today that he was looking for absolutely no drama in his life — and looking forward to sharing his love of pigeons with the world.
"I'm honored to be a part of this monumental show on Animal Planet,” says Tyson, whose first-ever fight as a child was in defense of his birds. “I feel a great pride acting as an official representative for all the pigeon fanciers out there. I want people to see why we love these birds. It feels good returning to the rooftops of the city where it all started for me — New York.”
The series will debut on Animal Planet in early 2011.

On Tuesday, former Goldman Sachs banker Rohit Bansa agreed to plead guilty to charges of taking confidential documents from a source at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he worked as a regulator for several years prior to his stint with the investment giant. Along with his source, a former New York Fed worker, Mr. Bansa could face up to a year in prison and a permanent ban from the banking industry for using the leaked documents to gain an unfair advantage when facing clients. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, could face up to $50 million in related fines.
Bansa's case is remarkable, in part, because criminal prosecutions are still rare on Wall Street. But it comes as the federal government has put a new emphasis on holding individual executives accountable for their companies' actions, and as white-collar workers and executives in other corners of the corporate world are even now being held accountable for corporate wrongdoing.
The trial of former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship marks “the first time in 150 years of Appalachian mining that the top boss of a coal firm has ever had to answer for how he ran his company,” according to Slate. That trial is set to conclude in November. And last month, the former CEO of the Peanut Corporation of America was sentenced to 28 years in prison for his role in a deadly salmonella outbreak in peanut butter – the largest ever in a food safety case in the US.
Meanwhile, a United States Department of Justice investigation into FIFA, world soccer's governing body, is focused mainly on high-ranking officials and top aides to former president Sepp Blatter (and possibly Blatter himself) on multiple charges of corruption.
Those cases, along with upcoming legal action surrounding Volkswagen admitting falsifying emissions tests on millions of its diesel fueled vehicles, will serve as a test of the recent Justice Department mandate. For organizations like VW, Goldman Sachs, and FIFA, that could mean the end of a legal landscape, in the US at least, where cases can be settled with a few multibillion dollar checks.
Far cry from Teddy Roosevelt
In the years since the 2008 credit collapse, when not a single banking executive went to jail for unscrupulous practices that contributed significantly to the recession, the idea of holding people – not just companies – accountable for corporate wrongdoing has become a point of contention, both in the public eye and the justice community.
In September, the Justice Department responded with a memo encouraging judges and prosecutors in corporate criminal cases to shift their case-building focus onto individuals, rather than the company as a whole.
“Such accountability is important for several reasons: it deters future illegal activity, it incentivizes changes in corporate behavior … and it promotes the public's confidence in our justice system,” read the guidelines, collectively known as the Yates memo (for its author, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates).
This isn't a new impulse. President Theodore Roosevelt was trust-busting back in the early 1900s, limiting the industry dominance of tycoons including J.P. Morgan. Hundreds of Wall Street executives went to prison during the fallout of the Savings and Loan crisis in the late 1980s and early '90s. Jeffrey Skilling, the head of now-defunct Enron, is serving a (reduced) 14-year sentence for his role in widespread accounting fraud that damaged that company and sent several people to jail.
But more recent, high-profile cases under former Attorney General Eric Holder's administration have been settled by the company admitting wrongdoing and paying fines. These include banks involved in creating the housing bubble to General Motors's years-long failure to repair a deadly ignition switch defect in millions of cars.
Many critics see this as an ineffectual corrective for companies that make billions in annual profits.
“We have descended too fully into the cesspool of crony capitalism when our most elite banks can commit what [Securities and Exchange Commission] investigations find to be fraud and still claim in filings … that they have ‘a strong record of compliance with securities laws,' ” said attorney Bill Black, a former bank regulator and a leading critic of how the Justice Department has pursued major banks, in a 2012 interview with billmoyers.com
Why it's so hard to convict execs
But there is a rationale behind allowing companies to settle.
One is cost. “It can be very expensive and difficult to fight the DoJ on these matters,” says Solomon Wisenberg, a partner who heads up the white collar practice at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough, a Washington law firm. In a lot of cases, it's cheaper to settle because of the potential impact of a case on a company's stock value and profits. For example, Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm at the center of the Enron debacle, never recovered from the prolonged court battle – even though the Supreme Court ultimately overturned the firm's conviction.
Second, holding executives culpable is simply harder to do. “These are fairly complicated sophisticated crimes, and it can be difficult to find a person that has all the requisite knowledge [for an individual conviction],” says Lucian Dervan, a professor at the Southern Illinois University School of Law. It's much easier to implicate an entire company, he says, because prosecutors can use bits and pieces of information from separate employees to build their case.
“It's a matter of the corporate structure insulating them,” Professor Dervan says. “Those at the top may have set the tone, but they don't have the day-to-day knowledge.”
The Yates memo doesn't offer anything revolutionary in the way of new tactics for prosecutors, Dervan says. But it does encourage them to “be thinking about the individual from Day 1” and warning corporations that they need to be prepared to cooperate. It instructs Justice Department lawyers not to resolve cases against entire corporations without having a “clear plan” to resolve those against individuals. It also warns strongly against making immunity for particular individuals a condition of settling a case with a corporation as a whole.

While it's not yet clear how those mandates will be followed, the Justice Department's FIFA investigation, for one, has been all about targeting officials. There is little indication so far of how the organization may be held culpable.
And VW could face jail time for some workers, as well as the possibility of record-breaking government fines. “Every case is different, but I think there's a very high likelihood of criminal charges,” Dervan says.
Haley did not directly champion a U.S. withdrawal, but she asserted that the nuclear restriction deal is a threat to U.S. national security because its structure leaves loopholes and discourages tough enforcement.
"You can't put lipstick on a pig," Haley said. "We have to look at the reality that this deal is flawed."
That appears to put her at odds with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has argued that despite imperfections, the deal offers benefits including a reprieve from the imminent threat of an Iranian bomb and solidarity with European and Asian allies.

In an address to the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Haley left little doubt that she would support a presidential finding next month that Iran is not complying with the deal. That would be a first step toward a U.S. withdrawal and would trigger a 60-day congressional review that Haley said would be beneficial.
"Congress could debate whether the nuclear deal is in fact too big to fail," Haley said.
"We should welcome a debate over whether the JCPOA is in U.S. national security interests," she said, using the abbreviation for the deal's formal title, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Haley criticized specifics of the deal and said Iran is trying to duck scrutiny by insisting that the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, cannot inspect military sites at will. She met with the agency's director and got a technical briefing about Iranian inspections last month that critics said was aimed at finding a peg for U.S. claims that Iran is cheating.
"#IAEA verification of Iran compliance with JCPOA is based on terms of agreement; not the ulterior motives of US officials, nor of lobbyists," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote Saturday on Twitter.
Related: [IAEA says Iran complying with 2015 nuclear deal]
Haley's larger critique echoed Trump's "America first" rationale toward foreign policy.
"If the president finds that he cannot in good faith certify Iranian compliance, he would initiate a process whereby we move beyond narrow technicalities and look at the big picture," she said. "At issue is our national security. It's past time we had an Iran nuclear policy that acknowledged that."
Congress mandated a quarterly presidential certification that Iran is meeting its requirements, which Trump has twice signed off on with reluctance. After the last such certification, in July, Trump strongly suggested that he would say no at the next opportunity, in October.
If Trump did trigger a congressional review this fall, it would come on top of a long list of must-do legislation.
The congressional requirement was a compromise that President Barack Obama accepted to win legislative backing for the deal, which he chose not to submit to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.
Upon a finding that Iran is not complying, Congress would consider whether to reimpose U.S. sanctions lifted as part of the agreement, and U.S. participation in the international agreement would be in limbo.
Other parties to the agreement have said they would not walk away simply because Trump finds Iran out of compliance. But an understanding between the United States and Iran after more than three decades of enmity was the cornerstone of the agreement, and it is not clear how important or effective the deal would be without Washington's participation.

The deal is backed by the United Nations and includes the five major nuclear powers that are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
"Our allies very much know that we should be concerned" about Iran's compliance, Haley said. "No, they don't want us to get out of the deal. But this is the thing: Are we going to take care of our allies and making sure they're comfortable? Or are we going to look out for our U.S. security interests?"

In Florida, Mentally Ill Suffer Abuse And Neglect
toggle caption Danny Rivero for NPR
As states have closed down mental hospitals, they've struggled to find housing for the mentally ill. In Florida, assisted-living facilities have become the de facto solution.
It takes just a high school diploma and 26 hours of training to run one of Florida's mental health assisted-living facilities — that's lower than the state requirements for becoming a beautician, a barber or even an auctioneer.
Now an investigation by The Miami Herald and member station WLRN has found sweeping failure within Florida's assisted-living industry, especially within the 1,109 facilities that cater to the mentally ill. The investigation found that those facilities have twice the rate of abuse and neglect compared to homes specifically for the elderly.
Nowhere are those problems more obvious than in Cannon Point, a neighborhood outside Fort Lauderdale. All eight of the facilities on its one U-shaped city block cater specifically to people with mental illness, giving it the highest concentration of mental-health assisted-living facilities in Florida.
It's one of South Florida's strangest places and patrolling it is one of the most complicated police officers you'll find.
On Patrol In Cannon Point
Lauderhill is a working-class city of 70,000 people. At 6 a.m., the sun is not up yet, but Officer Tom Merenda is patrolling the drab stucco buildings crammed into the Cannon Point neighborhood.
Even though the morning is dark and drizzly, Merenda is wearing shorts. His mom says he has nice legs; his colleagues make fun of his chicken legs. They also make fun of his affection for the characters of Cannon Point.

A figure shuffles up to Merenda, screaming something unintelligible. Merenda can just make out the man's grubby hat and stained sweatshirt.
Merenda smiles and says, "Top of the morning to you!"
The man says a few unintelligible words and then says he used to be a police officer. "I used to be a police for Hialeah Westland."
As a car approaches, Merenda warns the unsteady man to watch out. "Are you retired now?" he asks.
"I've been working for 'em for 50 years," the man replies.
"Well, it's about time to take a retirement," Merenda jokes.
Merenda calls men like this "our mental health consumers." It might sound condescending, but he actually has some very personal experiences.
First, to understand Officer Merenda, you need to understand this neighborhood. The eight privately run assisted-living facilities in Cannon Point try to help the mentally ill keep up with daily medications, get access to regular services and live comfortably.
That's the theory, at least.
A Police Call Every Four Hours
Cannon Point exemplifies the challenges of mental health assisted-living facilities. Police get a call from this neighborhood on average once every four hours. That's 14,000 calls from one city block over the last eight years.
The calls can show the brutal side of the neighborhood — at times dealing with runaways, suicide threats, self-inflicted harm or psychotic episodes.
To make matters worse, a drug-dealing culture has cropped up. Merenda says dealers call the place U-Street, and it has its own YouTube channel featuring videos of street fights and homemade rap anthems.
"It all comes with the territory," Merenda says.
Merenda polices Cannon Point more than almost anyone else in the Lauderhill Police Department. In fact, Merenda is really the only one who wants to patrol it. He has his own nickname for the place: "I call it home because it's my home away from home."
But at this early hour, Cannon Point is relatively quiet. Merenda points to a beige stucco building, the most heavily fined assisted-living facility in Florida.
"This facility here, Briarwood Manor, has one of our more prominent residents. His name is Stephen King," Merenda says. "He's not the famous book writer, he's a famous panhandler. But he's the nicest guy you ever meet — except for when he's on crack."
Two years ago, Merenda was dispatched to Cannon Point because King had gone on a drug-fueled rampage and was holed up in his room. Merenda knocked on the door, calling his name. King, high on crack, let fly a string of curses.
King had stabbed another resident with a large knife and had punched through a television set. When Merenda finally got into King's room, blood was everywhere.
"And you just have to put on some latex gloves and just go in there and try to subdue them without getting blood in your mouth or in your eyes or whatever," Merenda says. His eyes soften. "But he needs help."
Residents told police that the on-duty caretaker was asleep during the whole ordeal.
The incident was one of hundreds uncovered during the investigation by The Miami Herald and WLRN.
State agents caught employees in nearly 100 homes illegally doping residents, tying them up or locking them in isolation. Agents then caught each home committing the same violation again.
There were more than 500 cases where facilities failed to give patients their psychotropic drugs, psychological services or proper oversight. The rate of abuse and neglect was twice as high as at homes just for the elderly.
Good Intentions
This was not the city's vision for the Cannon Point neighborhood.
Merenda has no idea how it became a haven for drugs and violence. Earl Hahn, the planning and zoning director for Lauderhill, has a few theories because he's spent hundreds of hours trying to undo it.
"What's that saying? The road to hell is full of good intentions?" Hahn says.
Twenty years ago, he says, the city had a grand plan to turn Cannon Point into a haven for the middle-class elderly. That's the good intention part.
The road to hell bit? Special zoning allowed an exceptional density of assisted-living facilities in the neighborhood. Instead of homes for the elderly, mental health assisted-living facilities moved in.
Hahn says someone should have noticed the city was creating a psychiatric ward.
"You know it's hard to establish mental health facilities and many people don't want them in their neighborhoods," Hahn says. "Once we opened it up and said, 'Welcome! Welcome all!' then you've opened up the door. Owners say, 'Here we can locate without the problems.' "

What Can Replace Institutions?
And that's why Cannon Point isn't just a Florida problem. Legal experts, academics and disability advocates say you can pick anywhere in the country and find some version of this: the warehousing of people with mental illness.
In New York, advocates have been fighting "adult homes" that are bigger, they say, than some of the state institutions people are leaving. In Illinois, it's nursing homes: 15 percent of the population are people with mental illness. When mixed with elderly residents, there have been problems with rape and even murder.
Advocates say people with mental illnesses need services to help them integrate into normal society — the exact opposite of clustering people in homes, and the exact opposite of Cannon Point.
But from Merenda's perspective, Cannon Point is at least something.
"If it wasn't for these ALFs," he says, "either somebody would be on the street or they would be with a relative that can't take care of their loved one that's having problems."
But would Merenda send his grandparents to one of these assisted-living facilities?
"Sometimes you don't have a choice," he says.
A Personal Connection
This is where his story gets complicated. No one knows the problems with mental health assisted-living facilities better than Tom Merenda. His mother, Christine, is in one; she suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.
As he knocks on her door, he whispers, "She hasn't seen me in a while, so she's going to be freaking out."
Christine Merenda opens the door. "Hi mom!" her son says. Her face lights up.
"Oh, Tommy! Honey! Oh, I love you. I missed you." She hugs him. Her room smells like smoke. Her bed has one sheet. The walls are bare, except for a blue and green finger painting by one of Merenda's daughters.
"And how is my precious little Abbey?" she asks about his daughter.
"She's good," he replies.
"And how is my precious ... uh, little bit bigger, uh, little bit ... uh ... Skylar," she asks.
"She's good," he laughs.
After the visit, Merenda admits he feels guilty every time he visits her in that drab room.
"I know it's the only option I have because I can't afford to keep her where I'm living and when she is off her meds — I have kids at home and things like that," he says. "I just can't have them grow up in that type of environment."
There's a paradox in the way Merenda fights for this neighborhood. Advocates — and quite frankly commonsense — would say Cannon Point is not helping anyone.
City leaders even agree: They've just passed a law to remove all assisted-living facilities from the neighborhood within five years.
But that leaves Officer Merenda and others to wonder where the residents of Cannon Point will end up next.
A Rikers Island correction officer raped a female inmate for more than 15 minutes while another officer watched, a new Manhattan federal lawsuit charges.
The woman, identified only as “Jane Doe,” was on a Department of Correction bus inside the jail complex March 20 when a male inmate bribed a correction officer to leave him alone with her and the pair had apparently consensual sexual contact, according to the legal papers.
But then the officer got back on the bus, told the male inmate to get lost, and raped the woman, the suit says.
“Doe considered screaming out but chose not to scream because she realized that any officers who might respond from the [prison] were apt to be male and Doe was frightened that they might assault her as well,” her suit states.
During the rape, another correction officer got on the bus. The rapist allegedly said he wanted to “give [him] a show.”
The suit accuses Rikers of having a culture of rape and seeks unspecified damages.
“We will review the specific claims once we receive the complaint,” said a city Law Department spokesman.
What's wrong with my succulent?
Succulents are easier to grow than most, but like all plants, they have their problems, too. Here are some troubleshooting tips for common afflictions and conditions from the author of Succulents Simplified.
SYMPTOM Bleached, beige, or dark patches on leaves
CAUSE Excessive sun exposure
REMEDY Move plants into bright shade. Remove damaged leaves if unsightly.
SYMPTOM Distorted buds that don't open, tiny insects on new growth
CAUSE Aphids or thrips
REMEDY Spray with isopropyl alcohol diluted half-and-half with water and improve air circulation.
SYMPTOM Cancerous growth on aloes
CAUSE Aloe mite
REMEDY Cut out the damaged tissue, clean your tools, and if the plant is potted, isolate it from other aloes.
SYMPTOM Distorted growth at leaf axils and centers of rosettes, cottony bits
CAUSE Mealybug
REMEDY Remove or isolate affected plants; spray with diluted isopropyl alcohol and improve air circulation.
SYMPTOM Cottony bits adhering to roots
CAUSE Root mealybug
REMEDY Discard the affected soil; wash the container in soapy water; take cuttings of the plant and repot in fresh soil.
SYMPTOM Black depressions in aloe leaves
CAUSE Bacterial leaf spot
REMEDY Apply cinnamon spray or commercial systemic per label directions.
SYMPTOM Webs and paprika-like dots on leaves
CAUSE Red spider mite
REMEDY Spray with diluted isopropyl alcohol and improve air circulation.
SYMPTOM Sickly look, brown bumps on stems
CAUSE Scale insects
REMEDY Remove or isolate affected plants, spray with diluted isopropyl alcohol, scrape the scale off stems with a plastic knife, wash the plant with mild liquid detergent, and repot it in fresh soil.
SYMPTOM Collapsed outer leaves, upright center (agaves)
CAUSE Agave snout weevil
REMEDY Dig up and destroy the affected plant. Do not replant agaves in or near that area. Treat nearby agaves and soil with systemic insecticide.
SYMPTOM Holes in leaves
CAUSE Snails and slugs
REMEDY Hand pick; release predator snails or apply iron phosphate (Sluggo).
SYMPTOM Garden plants cropped to ground level
CAUSE Deer, squirrels, rabbits, or javelinas
REMEDY Enclose young, tender plants in chicken-wire cages.
SYMPTOM Collapsed, putty-colored leaves
CAUSE Frost
REMEDY Tent in-ground plants with frost cloth until the temperature exceeds 32 degrees F. Move containers beneath shelter or indoors. Prune dead tissue.
SYMPTOM Squishy stem or trunk
CAUSE Overwatering
REMEDY Take cuttings from healthy tissue and replant. Discard the old soil with the plant.
SYMPTOM Loss of sheen, shriveling at tips
CAUSE Underwatering
REMEDY Water thoroughly and then keep soil about as moist as a wrung-out sponge.
SYMPTOM Elongated, stretched-looking stems and leaves; flattened or downward-curving rosettes
CAUSE Not enough light
REMEDY Give greater sun incrementally. Rotate container weekly for even exposure.
SYMPTOM Greening of yellow, red, or orange leaves
CAUSE Too much pampering
REMEDY Stress the plant with less water, more sun, and less rich soil. Don't fertilize.
SYMPTOM Irregular white rings on dark leaves
CAUSE Mineral deposits from evaporated water drops
REMEDY Using distilled water, gently wipe the leaves. Avoid splashing the leaves when watering the plant.
SYMPTOM Dry leaves at base of echeverias, aloes, or other rosette succulents
CAUSE Normal growth
REMEDY Crisp, papery leaves shade and insulate the stem. But if you find them unsightly, peel them away.
SYMPTOM Stem awkwardly long with rosette at the tip
CAUSE Normal growth
REMEDY Remove any old, dry leaves at the base of the rosette, then cut the stem 1 inch below healthy leaves and replant the rosette as a cutting.
SYMPTOM Closed or shrunken rosettes
CAUSE Heat, drought, or cold; dormancy
REMEDY Move container-grown plants under an eve or overhang to protect from harsh outdoor conditions. If plants are merely dormant, leave them alone; they'll revive when they awaken.

This post was originally published last year. With this year's Shark Week programming beginning tonight, we thought this would be a good reminder of some of Discovery's more unpleasant tendencies.
Discovery's Shark Week reached an important milestone this week: it hit an all-time rating high, which the network partially attributes to an increase in female viewership. But instead of receiving acclaim, Discovery is getting pummeled by the media. A sample of recent headlines include "Shark Week is once again making things up," "Shark Week isn't just misguided, it's downright dangerous," and "More Sharknado than Science." Of course, this isn't the first time Shark Week has experienced backlash for its negative portrayal of sharks and its tendency to rely on fiction rather than fact, as last year's Megalodon documentary was widely trashed for suggesting that extinct sharks still roam Earth's waters.
But this year feels different, perhaps because a number of shark scientists have begun to explain why they refuse to work with Discovery — and how Shark Week burned them in the past.
The Shark Week burn
Jonathan Davis' story is a prime example. His research was featured on Shark Week last year as part of a show called Voodoo Shark, which explored the existence of the "Rooken" — a fictional shark monster that dwells in the Louisiana Bayous. But, as io9 reported on Monday, Davis didn't know that the producers were going to use his work to perpetuate a myth. In fact, he says, it wasn't until his two-and-a-half hour interview with producers ended that he was asked, as an afterthought, what he thought of the voodoo shark.
"They portrayed it as though I believe in the Voodoo shark and that my research focused on searching for it."
"The interviewer said, 'What do you think of this monster shark called the Rooken in South Louisiana,' and my answer was ‘That's complete BS, there's no such thing, I've never heard of it, but if I had I would know that it wasn't true,'" Davis explains. Then, the producer asked Davis about the existence of large bull sharks. He said that there could absolutely be large sharks in the area, even right behind them. It wasn't until months later that he found out what had become of this answer.
"They chopped up the second question, and superimposed my second answer to the first question," he says. "They showed a Southern hillbilly fisherman talking about the voodoo shark, and then they pan to me, saying, ‘Shark scientist Jonathan Davis believes that if the voodoo shark is here, it will be in the lake bayous.'"
Outraged, Davis tried to get in touch with Discovery, but they never answered his emails. "They portrayed it as though I believed in the Voodoo shark and that my research focused on searching for it — the overall outlook of the show was terrible."
The Verge contacted Discovery to verify Davis' story, but the network declined to address his assertions directly, stating instead:
For 27 years Shark Week has been the prime showcase for all things shark – science, legend and conservation concerns. A whole generation that has grown up with shark week have awareness and issues for sharks; many marine biologists cite Shark Week as bringing them into that field. Discovery Channel has been one of the biggest contributors to furthering shark research and have paid for technology that has been critical in the studies.
The production company that worked with Davis also got back to us, but they were equally vague:
It's our goal at Gurney Productions to work closely with marine experts and scientists worldwide. We strive to create awareness for the entire shark species. The more viewers we can bring to TV through Shark Week the more potential donations that will come to the table to help study and preserve these awesome creatures and fight the real problem — commercial shark fishing and finning.
One might have expected to see less myth and more reality in this year's shows. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be the case, because as one zoologist explained in a blog post for Southern Fried Science, the documentary that explored the existence of the "Shark Submarine" on Sunday night is actually the product of a fictional story created by journalists in the 1970s. These journalists, Michelle Wcisel explains, wanted to demonstrate how easy it was to fool readers, so they made up a story about a large white shark in South Africa's False Bay. Seeing the myth propagated onscreen in 2014, she writes, "literally broke my heart to watch." And so shark experts are speaking out.
"A number of years ago, I was in a project in which the focus was on the USS Indianapolis, the US cruiser that went down at the end of WWII," says George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the Florida Museum of Natural History who has participated in Shark Week numerous times. Survivors of the wreckage were involved with sharks afterwards, he explains, so Discovery brought him in to speak to some of them. "It was a hugely moving testimony from these guys and the film crew from the UK did a marvelous job from making a docu-drama out of it," he says. But when Discovery saw the finished product, they changed the name of the special to "Ocean of Fear" (Burgess doesn't recall the original title, which he says was far less provocative), and asked for changes.
"They made the film crew go back and insert more scared-to-death guys in the water."
"They made the film crew go back and insert more scared-to-death guys in the water, and injected it throughout the film to make it more scary," he says. But even after that show aired, Burgess continued to believe that Discovery could turn things around — until the Megalodon special aired last year.
"[Megalodon] was probably the final nail in the coffin as far as I was concerned," he says. "I defended their programming, but it's hard for me to do that now after such an overtly bad show that was put out for titillating purposes only, and clearly had no factual basis."
This year, Kristine Stump, a research associate at Shedd Aquarium, counts herself among those who have spoken out against Discovery's practices. "The basic premise was a camera crew was dropping in on real scientists doing actual hammerhead research," Stump told io9 about a special that aired Tuesday night. Instead, her work was featured on a special called Monster Hammerhead — one that Discovery says documents how "a team of scientists and anglers look to explore the mystery and find out if the legend could be real." Predictably, Stump said that the description "does not match the description of what we filmed."
Despite the mounting criticism, Discovery still has supporters among members of the shark community. Eli Martinez, publisher and editor of Shark Diver Magazine, has worked with Discovery on multiple occasions, including this year. "What I specialize in is interacting and working with sharks," he says. "They didn't ask me to do anything that I didn't want to do."
"They didn't ask me to do anything that I didn't want to do."
In fact, he says, the only pressure he feels comes from the shark community itself. "They are calling me a sellout," he says, for participating in a special this year called Zombie Sharks (the name Discovery chose to represent tonic immobility — a phenomenon in which some sharks fall into a trance-like state when their noses are rubbed or when they're held belly-up). "People don't know what the show is about and just from the name alone, I've gotten some heat."
Moreover, he says, throwing Discovery under the bus for something that most nature and science channels do every day isn't entirely fair. "I remember sitting in a meeting at National Geographic and we started talking about bringing in the science and conservation people [for a show]." But the minute Martinez's team brought science up, they were told that National Geographic wanted to downplay that part as much as they could. "They said, if I want to do this show, we need less science, and more of the excitement, fear, and fun of the animal."
What does this mean for Shark Week?
As ratings continue to soar, it's unlikely that Discovery will change its strategy. And given the current expert exodus away from Discovery's programming, Shark Week might soon be a place that only gives voice to charlatans. "If they don't start adjusting their programming at a real-world level they will have less and fewer experts and substituting with more pseudo-experts," Burgess says. "It's kind of sad because the audience is already guaranteed and they are choosing this route."
Todd Cameron, an activist who recently swam 1,429 miles to raise awareness about the dire ecological situation sharks are facing, is one of the casualties of Discovery's poor business practices. He, too, was approached by Discovery to participate in one of its shows, but turned the opportunity down. He took to Facebook in July to explain his decision:
Cameron told The Verge that Shark Week is "very juvenile," adding that "sharks are such a crucial species and 100 million are killed each year, you would think that Shark Week would be doing something educational." He also takes issue with the way sharks are shown approaching researchers' boats. "You need to bait blue sharks for three hours just to see one," he says. "If you don't do that they have no reason to come up to the boat — that's the reality of shark diving." But Discovery rarely tells viewers this, he says, and they often omit vital pieces of information, like the fact that many species depicted in the shows never come near humans. "They are taking an extremely skittish, docile, and shy animal like a tiger shark or a hammerhead shark and they are tuning it into a monster."
Researchers "don't want to be part of the hate."
Samantha Sherman, a marine biologist at James Cook University, says that Shark Week was "the best week of the year" growing up, but it has taken a distinct turn toward pseudoscience. As a result, she says, her colleagues have been less than forthcoming when producers have called them and asked for help. "I have a couple friends that have been approached by Discovery and have turned it down because of where it's going and the fear-mongering," she says. "They don't want to be part of the hate, or have their message misinterpreted so they have just said ‘no.'"
"There is a distinct lack of well-published and highly-regarded shark scientists involved in the programming," said Christine Dudgeon, a leopard shark ecologist at the University of Queensland in Australia, in an email to The Verge. Instead of focusing on the science, she says, they show shark attacks — which, for the record, are still rare, despite a recent increase (between 2006 and 2010, an average of 4.2 fatal shark attacks occurred each year).
This begs the question: could Discovery maintain its current success without relying on sensationalism? According to Sherman, there's more than enough exciting shark science to fuel such an endeavor. "There are so many other sharks out there — sharks that can do things that most people wouldn't believe, like glow blue." With over 400 species of sharks in existence, she says, it's unfortunate that Shark Week often only profiles three or four.
But content is only one side of the coin: viewers have to tune in, too. A change in Discovery's strategy would probably be welcomed by experts, but would likely mean a drop in ratings over time. "The TV world isn't putting anything out there that the audience isn't asking for," Martinez says. "I mean look at Sharknado! It's horrible, but the audience loved it enough to make a second one."

It has been nearly a decade since President George W. Bush chose arrogance over humility as the basis of American foreign policy. The intervening years have not been good for the United States or the Republican Party. As the GOP seeks to take back the White House it needs to conduct a serious foreign policy debate. Republicans should start by listening to Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas).
At the recent Southern Republican Leadership Conference big spending Mitt Romney bested Rep. Paul by just one vote in the popularity contest. Yet Paul eschewed reliance on easy applause lines and challenged the newfound Republican fondness for big militaries and constant wars.
For instance, Paul observed that conservatives, like liberals, enjoyed spending money, only "on different things. They like embassies, and they like occupation. They like the empire. They like to be in 135 countries and 700 bases."
Similarly, Paul said, conservatives talked about following the Constitution, "except for war. Let the president go to war anytime they want."
Paul garnered applause from more youthful members of the audience. But boos were heard as well. Many establishment GOP activists appear to have become wedded to a big-government foreign policy.
When Politico polled activists and analysts about why the GOP mainstream was hostile to Paul, James Carafano of the Heritage Foundation complained that "The deliberate self-weakening of America is an invitation to disaster." Carafano argued that Paul failed to fulfill the constitutional obligation to "provide for the common defense" and that the latter's vision would not keep America "safe, free, and prosperous."
Yet Washington's policy of promiscuous intervention is not providing for America's "common defense." Rather, the U.S. is protecting virtually every other nation. That's one reason why the Pentagon was incapable of defending Americans when the U.S. was attacked on 9/11,
Indeed, the "Defense Department" has become anything but. Most of America's forces do nothing to secure the U.S. They instead are employed to remake failed societies, impose Washington's meddlesome dictates, and subsidize populous and prosperous allies.
Do the Europeans want someone to stop a civil war in Yugoslavia? They leave it to Americans. Do the Georgians want someone to protect them after they start a war with Russia? Tbilisi begs Washington.
Do the South Koreans hope to subsidize North Korea while someone else guarantees their security? The South Korean "Blue House" calls the American "White House." Do the Japanese want to concentrate on economic development while leaving the protection of regional security to another country? They turn to the U.S. Do the Israelis want someone else to disarm Iran? They call on Washington.
And in every case the Republican elite willingly answers "yes," spending Americans' money to provide for most every other nations' defense.
The Europeans might have a larger collective GDP and population. The South Koreans might enjoy a GDP 40 times that of the North. Japan might have the world's second largest economy. Israel might be a regional superpower with up to 200 nuclear weapons.
Yet in GOP eyes all are helpless American dependents, to be defended by Washington at all cost - and apparently forever.
This policy has made America weaker. We are less "safe, free, and prosperous" as a result.
America's safety is compromised because we are more often at war and at risk of war. Indeed, intervening promiscuously and setting tripwires around the world has kept the U.S. involved in conflict almost constantly after the Cold War.
Iraq is the most obvious disaster. More than 4,000 dead and tens of thousands maimed or injured Americans. Total cost likely to hit $2 trillion. The U.S. military overstretched. Iran's strategic position greatly strengthened.
In fact, many Republican legislators apparently have come to recognize reality in Iraq. When asked how many GOP congressmen believed that the Iraq war had been a mistake, a panel of three Republican members at a recent Cato Institute conference agreed: "almost all of us."
But it could be far worse. It appears that top Bush administration officials debated launching air strikes against Russian forces during Moscow's conflict with Georgia.
Ponder the thought: After the U.S. made it through the Cold War without getting into a shooting match with the Soviet Union, Washington officials considered attacking that nuclear-armed power to defend a country which: by most accounts other than its own started the fighting; was not party to any military alliance or treaty with America; and was irrelevant to U.S. security. Had the administration initiated military action, the unsuspecting American people could have found themselves in a nuclear confrontation and even war in August 2008.
Such are the risks to Americans' safety when their government plays globocop.
The national security state also has made Americans less free. A century ago social critic Randolph Bourne observed: "War is the health of the state."
The U.S. was created as a constitutional republic, with a limited national government bounded by law. Yet the last Republican administration claimed that the president could unilaterally, subject to review neither by Congress nor the courts, order the arrest and indefinite detention of American citizens in America. In effect, the president asserted that he was an elected monarch or dictator, presumed infallible and beyond reproach. The defining characteristic of the so-called Patriot Act and other such enactments was not the expansion of federal power, but the refusal to hold accountable those who exercised the new power.
Finally, Americans are less prosperous. While U.S. citizens pay to defend dozens of nations around the world, those countries invest in business enterprises, economic research and development, and generous welfare states. Trade competitors cheerfully accept U.S. military troops while excluding commercial products.
The defense budget is the price of our nation's foreign policy, and the price is high. The U.S. is spending more than $700 billion annually on the military. In real terms that is more than at any point during the Cold War, Korean War, or Vietnam War. Today America accounts for roughly half of the globe's military outlays.
This is a year when the deficit will run almost $1.6 trillion. When America faces $10 trillion in deficits over the next decade. When Washington's debt is climbing skyward. And when Social Security and Medicare face unfunded liabilities of an astounding $107 trillion.
Yet Americans, like Ron Paul, who advocate a policy to actually make America safer, freer, and wealthier, are routinely vilified by Republican apparatchiks. The Bush administration and its neoconservative supporters accused opponents of being defeatists and even traitors. Politico guest contributor Robert White was milder, merely accusing Paul of preaching "isolationism and appeasement" and of not appearing to be "strong on national defense."
For these Republicans opposition to bombing or invading other nations is "isolationist." Failing to view war or the threat of war as the best response to every foreign problem is "appeasement."
In fact, war should always be a last resort, a matter of necessity rather than choice. And we can learn much from the Cold War: there were enthusiastic advocates of preventive war against both the Soviet Union and China, but deterrence kept the peace against the likes of Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. In retrospect the latter policy looks good compared to the potential of triggering World War III.
Moreover, intervention and conflict beget intervention and conflict. America's troubles with Iran began in 1953 with the CIA-backed coup d'etat against the democratically elected government. Washington's support for the autocratic Shah sowed the seeds which turned into the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Fear of aggressive Islamic fundamentalism caused the Reagan administration to back Saddam Hussein in the 1980s after he invaded Iran. That encouraged Baghdad to invade Kuwait. Then came the first Gulf War and Washington's stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia. Those forces later were targeted in the Khobar barracks bombings; the U.S. presence also inflamed hostility from the likes of Osama bin Laden.
According to Paul Wolfowitz, a desire to bring home those forces was a benefit of the Iraq war. But the Iraq invasion empowered Iran, now accused of pursuing the Shah's dream of nuclear weapons. So Washington's sofa samurai are demanding that bombers be sent forthwith against Tehran.
It would have been much better in 1953 had Washington's coup plotters stayed home. Much brutality, war, and horror might have been avoided.
Ron Paul isn't likely to be the GOP presidential nominee in 2012 whatever position he takes on foreign policy. But for the last decade GOP politicians have inflated foreign threats, ignored military costs, and disregarded America's interests in their search for political advantage. If the Republican Party wants to return to power - and especially if it genuinely wants to keep America "safe, free, and prosperous" - it will engage rather than dismiss Rep. Paul's critique of U.S. foreign policy.
Scandia students raise money to bring library back Copyright by KSNW - All rights reserved Video
SCANDIA, Kan. (KSNW) - Technology made its way to Pike Valley High School about nine years ago, which impacted the library's function. Then, budget cuts happened, book inventory went downhill, and the school lost its librarian.
The library door is now locked to students, the one group of people who need it open the most.
"The teachers and the staff here have really put into us that if you want something for your education, you need to go after it," said Jentry McGregor, a Pike Valley High School sophomore.
McGregor, along with nine other students, formed the "Bring Back the Library" committee. The students have been raising money and applying for grants to bring back their library, which includes some renovations to the current space.
So far, students have built a wall to create a partition between the new library and the classroom. The space will soon have new flooring and an updated book inventory. Students also came up with the idea to add a coffee bar in the library.
Organizers said it's been frustrating not having the library as a resource, especially during class projects.
"I needed a book on Gandhi, and I couldn't find one," said sophomore Tory Isaacson. "I couldn't find one at the city library, so I went to the next city over and found one."
It hasn't been easy for book lovers either, like senior Brooke Luedke.
"Some kids like to read for enjoyment," she said. "If the library is locked, they can't come in and check out a book."
The students have been looking at purchasing a computer, bar code scanner and a computer program for processing book check-outs. Another goal of the committee is to obtain volunteers to supervise the library at least three hours a day.
School officials said ACT scores have dropped significantly in the past few years, so they're looking for many ways to encourage good study habits -- saying the library would be one more place for that.
Isaacson said she's looking forward to using the library as a place to study, instead of at her house.
"I need a quiet place," she explained. "I tend to get distracted."
The students are continuing to raise money for the project and hope to have the library ready by May. If you'd like to learn more about "Bring Back the Library" or are interested in donating to the students' project, visit their WeKan fundraising site.
If you are tired of Tofu and are looking for an alternative protein source, look no more. Red lentils pack 3.1g of protein in each tablespoon, and are rich in iron, folate and magnesium. I always thought lentils took a long time to cook and you needed to use the pressure cooker. I used green lentils to make Lentil Burger with Mushroom and it took an over to cook completely. Red lentils, on the other hand were done in 15 to 20 minutes. Now when you combine this with swiss chard, it takes the wholesomeness of this recipe to a different level. Swiss chard, frequently described as the most nutritious vegetable around, turns out is an amazing post-run recovery food. The stems have phytonutrients that act as anti-inflammatory agents and glutamine, an amino acid that's known to help with healing.
Red Lentil Curry
Imagine, all of this goodness in 20 minutes, 30 if you include the minimum prep that's required for this red lentil curry recipe. Here's what you need:
1 medium Onion, chopped
2 cloves of Garlic, chopped
1 bunch of Swiss Chard
4 tsp Curry Powder
1 cube of Rapunzel Vegan Bouillon
1/2 cup of Red Lentils, washed thoroughly
De-stem the Swiss Chard, trim the ends and chop the stems and the leaves separately. Start with 2 tbsp of Olive Oil on a heated wok and add the Curry Powder in. Stir for a minute in high heat and then add in the onion and garlic. A few minutes later, add in the Swiss Chard stems stirring frequently and then set aside. Meanwhile in a soup pot, add 2 cups of water, bring to boil and add in the Rapunzel Vegan Bouillon. When the cube is fully dissolved, add in the red lentils and the stir-fry mix. Bring to boil, turn the heat down and let simmer for 10-15 minutes. When the lentils are almost done, add in the Swiss Chard leaves and simmer for another 5 minutes. Serves four and keeps well in the fridge for a week.
On morning runs, I sometimes make tacos with corn tortillas and left-over red lentil curry for a quick snack, before heading out. The slow burning complex carbohydrates in the red lentils mean you can run 10 or 15 miles without having to carry food with you.
Have you made red lentil curry? How do you cook it?
China's out to own the sun. What about the United States? Plus, what we're doing to protect ourselves from cyberattacks on energy grids.
In this Oct. 9, 2015, file photo, solar panels are seen near the power grid in northwestern China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region. (Ng Han Guan/AP)
Donald Trump talks a lot about coal, but its solar energy that's been on a roll lately. But a lot of that roll has been in China. China wants to, in effect, own the sun. It is now absolutely dominant in solar panel manufacturing. Its driven prices down and down. Price-wise, solar energy can now outcompete fossil-fueled electricity in the Middle East. Cheap panels are driving a lot of solar installation jobs in the USA. Where does all this go? This hour On Point: Who owns the sun? The energy future and solar. -- Tom Ashbrook

From Tom's Reading List
The New York Times: When Solar Panels Became Job Killers — "The story of China's rise in solar panels illustrates the profound difficulties the country presents to Mr. Trump, or to any American president. Its size and fast-moving economy give it the ability to redefine industries almost on a dime. Its government-led pursuit of dominance in crucial industries presents a direct challenge to countries where leaders generally leave business decisions to the businesses themselves."
Reuters: China solar, wind to attract $780 billion investment by 2030 - research report — "China has pledged to increase non-fossil fuel energy to at least 20 percent of total consumption by the end of the next decade, up from 12 percent in 2015, part of its efforts to tackle air pollution and bring carbon dioxide emissions to a peak by around 2030."
Bloomberg: Republican Cracks Emerge in Trump's Coal-Heavy Energy Plan — "Trump may be resolutely committed to fossil fuels, but the economic reality is renewables are now among the cheapest sources of electricity. Wind and solar were the biggest sources of power added to U.S. grids three years running, becoming key sources of jobs in rural America. That's created clean-energy constituencies in North Carolina, Texas and other parts of the country that supported Trump in November."

Income and property taxes are the tip of our tax iceberg.
I didn't think much about this until I saw that for the past three years local, state and federal spending per household now exceeds the median household income. That spending is supported by ever increasing taxes in all kinds of forms — and, importantly, by more government borrowing, which bring even higher taxes for future generations.
I've also come to realize that corporate taxes are really similar to a value-added-tax (VAT). The VAT is the principal tax in many foreign countries.
Think about it. Everything that you buy is built from products that have innumerable and hidden taxes included in the price. At every level of production, the producer or service provider paid the accumulated taxes on the labor, goods, equipment, services and utilities required. You may have some appreciation of the latter when you see the taxes included in your monthly telephone and power bills. When you buy a product, you are paying for the taxes on the telephone and power bills of every firm that had something to do with getting that product to the store.
Look at the attached figure which illustrates some of the common levels of production needed for something we might buy. We see only the sales tax at the top of the pile. But that product went through the hands of many firms before it got to us. Each had its own tax. In fact, each is paying tax on the taxes included in the cost of everything below it.
Tax on tax — ad infinitum
Sometimes there are more levels than in the figure, sometimes there are less. But it is hard to imagine what the lowest level is. Even the farmer or miner of raw materials has to pay for equipment, supplies, services and utilities, all of which are taxed — usually in many different ways.
To illustrate how taxes on taxes grow, suppose that eight steps were involved before the buyer finally pays taxes to have the product serviced. Suppose also that the value added at each step was twice its component costs. Further suppose that at each step only 3% of its price was for a tax. That 3% at each step ends up costing 6% more for the final buyer.
In the oversimplified illustration, if a corporation was involved at each step, and each paid 30% tax on 10% profit, the final tax cost would be 6% of the price that we, as consumers, pay. Corporations simply pass on such taxes to buyers. Those increased taxes we pay may make it tougher to compete with foreign companies which don't have such a tax. To the extent that high-level corporate officers' pay is based on volume, corporate taxes may actually add to their compensation. On the other hand, an officer showing reduced corporate taxes may also get higher compensation.
There are likely more than 100 kinds of taxes we pay, one way or another. Michael Snyder compiled a list of 97 different kinds of taxes. I was able to think of three more that apply to me.
So with all of this taxation, you'd think the government would be better funded — and yet, spending divided by the number of households is more than the median household gross income. We focus on a budget that covers how we spend our money — but clearly we need to pay more attention on how the government spends the money we give them. Political promises for more benefits may actually be far from an overall benefit as the cost of purchases, services and income taxes increase accordingly.
The American Revolution was over the British stamp tax of 1765 that required a tax on wills, deeds, newspapers, pamphlets and such. What a romp the patriots of those days would have today. They might focus on our having to print money to pay the interest on the national debt and "borrowing" from the Social Security Trust Fund. Or they might dig into the unfunded obligations of state and federal government for future pension and welfare promises.
Patrick Henry would really turn up the volume.
With tax day behind us, taxpayers may soon have something else to celebrate from the IRS. In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee today, IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller was questioned aggressively about documents released by the ACLU last week that indicate that the IRS does not think it needs a warrant to read all emails and other electronic communications during criminal investigations. Under pressure from senators, Miller agreed to update IRS policy documents within 30 days to state that a warrant is required for access to all emails, regardless of their age.
Two senators from opposite sides of the aisle, Senator Grassley (R-IA) and Senator Wyden (D-OR), pressed Miller about whether the IRS has sought or obtained emails without a warrant since a federal appeals court ruled in 2010 that a warrant is required for all emails. (You can watch the hearing here. Sen. Grassley's questions start at 1:25:00 and Sen. Wyden's questions start at 1:31:10.) They asked why the IRS seems to be ignoring that 2010 decision—United States v. Warshak—in most of the country, and advising its criminal investigative agents that emails stored on a server for more than 180 days can be obtained without a warrant. Surprisingly, Miller answered that the IRS follows Warshak across the country. That's not what internal IRS documents and its public policy manual show, but if true it is welcome news. Importantly, Miller committed to clarify written IRS policy within 30 days to state that a warrant is always required.
Miller's testimony leaves several important questions unanswered, however:
Although Miller stated that the IRS Criminal Investigation unit obtains warrants for all emails, he did not discuss other forms of electronic communication such as text messages, instant messages, and direct messages on social media. Under the Fourth Amendment, a warrant should be required for those private communications as well.
Miller stated that, to his knowledge, the IRS has not obtained electronic communications without a warrant in the past. But an internal IRS Chief Counsel Advice memorandum from 2011 reveals that, months after Warshak, IRS investigative agents requested emails from an internet service provider without a warrant at least once. The IRS should explain when it started following Warshak nationally, and whether it has sought or obtained emails without a warrant in the past.
We applaud Senators Grassley and Wyden for quickly taking up this important issue and getting an answer from the IRS, less than a week after the ACLU released the IRS documents. But while the IRS's apparent change of policy is a step in the right direction, there is more for Congress to do. The current IRS policy manual relies on the outdated Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which only requires a warrant for some emails and other electronic communications. In order to uniformly protect the privacy of Americans' private communications, lawmakers must update ECPA to require a warrant for the contents of all electronic communications, regardless of age or other factors. Strong reform legislation has been introduced by a bipartisan group of sponsors, and is starting to make its way through the legislative process. Follow this link to urge Congress to modernize our electronic privacy law and close the loophole that's letting the government access email and other electronic communications without a warrant.
According to their Twitter profile, Engine is “a collection of North Louisiana musicians who combine the old elements of folk with the warmth of fuzzy synthesizers and modest electric guitar work.” At the center of this collection is Landon Miller, a soft-spoken and infinitely likeable guy who, like three other members of the band, is a southern Louisiana native with a minister for a dad.
“Most of us grew up playing gospel and folk, because that's what our parents listened to,” Miller said from his porch in Shreveport's Highland neighborhood.
A spiritual influence shines through on the band's sophomore album, “Caverns of Sonora,” which they recently completed. The album is available for free streaming or paid download via their Bandcamp page, and will be released on CD at a June 2 performance at Fatty Arbuckle's. This Friday, May 11, they'll play “a sort of soft-release” show for the album at Mojo's (203 Texas Street, downtown Shreveport). The show begins at 11 p.m. and is 21 and up. Admission is free.
To stream the album in its entirety for free, visit their Bandcamp page.

COLLECTIONS | Dunhill – Spring/Summer 2016
Tailcoats, top hats, and floral lapel pins opened the runway show for Dunhill. For a moment the audience was transported back to a time when men dressed for dinner and parties. It was like sneaking a glimpse of the glamorous lifestyles of British royalty.
Flawlessly, the collection transitioned to modern formal attire with double breasted suits, sport coats, and trench coats. Classic patterns were used within the designs like glen check, madras plaid, gingham and pinstripe. The patterns were showcased with the use of an earthy color palate.
Apart from the fact the entire collection was perfectly tailored, items like utility jackets, sportswear jackets, and ponchos were included in the show. These items were paired with accessories like leather riding boots, embossed leather bags, and fedoras. These looks could attend a gala as well as hunt in the shires of the UK.
Overall, Dunhill was able to recreate a gilded era for modern day.

"That's one reason Porsches have evolved from modes of transportation to mythic symbols. Its fans don't just drive the cars; they collect them."
“It's a pity,” Majewski says.
Maybe, I think. But for Porsche, the point of the 911, the highest-performance car among its production stable, is that it can do all that a driver like Majewski asks of it, even if most drivers will never push their cars nearly that hard.
Porsche cars are designed for driving, not merely looking good in the driveway.
Its cars are gorgeous, no doubt. But for Porsche, design is also about authenticity. That's an overused word in the corner offices of most corporate headquarters. But in Porsche's case, it's a word that had resonance in the earliest days of the company. When founderFerry Porsche was asked about the design of the company's very first car, the 356, he said, “In the beginning, I looked around but couldn't find the car I dreamt of, so I decided to build it myself.”
The son of a car designer—his father Ferdinand created the original Volkswagen Beetleat the request of Adolf Hitler—Porsche infused his company with a passion for creating dream-worthy vehicles that continues to this day. It's the reason J.D. Power and Associates ranked Porsche in 2008 not just the top automaker in quality but also in delighting customers with design and performance.
Porsche understands that customers are willing to shell out money for goods that engage them, goods to which they have personal connections.
The way a company such as Porsche creates those products is by developing cars that its designers crave. No cutting corners. Nothing inauthentic that risks the company's credibility. From that first 356, Porsche's strategy has been to create cars that its designers wish they could own.
That's one reason Porsches have evolved from modes of transportation to mythic symbols.
Its fans don't just drive the cars; they collect them. The company believes that roughly 70 percent of all Porsches built since the original 356 are still on the road today.
With that lust come the scores of Porsche coffee table books stuffed with glossy photos of its race cars, its 356s, and its 911s. Porsche clubs circle the globe, from the United States to Germany to New Zealand to Lebanon.
Porsche has used design to create a cult.

Facebook announced yesterday that “every post and comment — both public and private — by a U.S. user that mentions a presidential candidate's name will be fed through a sentiment analysis tool that spits out anonymized measures of the general U.S. Facebook population.” This analysis, along with reader polls and other information, will in turn be shared with politico.com.
The brief announcement of this new feature raises serious questions and offers few answers. Most troubling is Facebook's willingness to search and collect users' private political preferences and thoughts, preferences they may have shared only with their closest friend in a private email.
This raises at least three concerns. The first is that many users may not want to be part of any “sentiment analysis” or poll. For example, they may be a firm supporter of Mitt Romney but find Ron Paul's ideas interesting. Are they now going to feel hesitant to talk about Paul's ideas out of awareness that it might be registered as support or boost a candidate they don't like? Second, we don't see any mention of user consent anywhere in Facebook's announcement. How has Facebook decided that users agreed that their personal communications can and should be used in this way?
Finally, what other uses might this information be put to in the future? Will it be used to serve users ads from politicians or manipulate voting preferences in some way? We can see the marketing materials from Facebook now: “Candidates, serve ads to secret supporters! No one knows about their preferences except their closest friends and us.”
Worse, what if this secret knowledge is used to shape messages? Users would likely not expect they are getting a Romney ad that highlights libertarianism because in the past they said something positive about Ron Paul in an email.
We place a premium on political speech in the United States and debating candidates' positions and merits. Because Facebook has become one of the central forums for political debate it has a duty to clearly disclose any practices that threaten to distort that discussion. It can begin by bringing transparency to this process and answering some basic questions – beginning with how it justifies including users' private communications.

I just finished writing a WPBusiness.info newsletter about WordPress page templates and how businesses could leverage them to create better content. In the email, I brainstorm about a few templates I think themes should be taking advantage of. This is my list of page templates to keep an eye out for in a new theme or possibly some worth adding to your current one.
Useful WordPress Page Templates
Full Width Page Template
This is probably the most widely used page template. It's popular for landing pages on business sites and sometimes just an easy way to make extra space for a large graphic.
(Example) - (Code)
Site Map Page Template
A sitemap could be generated by a plugin but themes can often display them much more elegantly.
(Example) - (Code)
Gallery Page Template
A gallery page template could pull all images attached to a post and display them in an organized manner with some flashy effect. Also keep the new post formats and gallery shortcode in mind when creating galleries on the fly.
(Example)
List Subpages/ChildPages Template
This page template display links of its subpages. Comes in handy more than you would think. This makes it easy to generate press release and news archives without using posts.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said Tuesday that “Russians are laughing” at America under President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE.
“I think the Russians are laughing,” he said in an interview on MSNBC. “I think that's right, but they're laughing at how easy it is. And how our president, unfortunately, is helping with their agenda.”
McFaul added that recent reports of conflict in NATO and the Group of Seven (G7) please Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Let's just be clear that NATO and G7 — those are our clubs,” he said. “Those are clubs that we set up to advance our national security interests, to advance our prosperity.”
“And the result of this trip has been discord in both of those groups,” McFaul added of Trump's first foreign trip as president last week. “That is music to Putin's ears.”
Trump earlier Tuesday criticized Germany in a tweet about the European nation's NATO and military spending and trading with the U.S.
“We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military,” he said. “Very bad for U.S. This will change.”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday said that Germany could no longer “completely depend” on the U.S. as a reliable partner. Merkel and Trump repeatedly seemed at odds last week on issues including climate change, NATO spending and trade.
A Russian company called Open Mobile Platform (Открытая Мобильная Платформа) is developing its own mobile operating system to rival Android.
Communications Minister Nikolai Nikiforov tweeted a link to job ads seeking developers, infrastructure architects, testers and security types.

The advertiser is a company called Open Mobile Platform, founded just last month. The company is pitching the Linux-based system as something for large enterprises and privacy wonks who are seeking "trusted" mobile solutions.
It will initially be offered in Russian to meet local demands and regulatory requirements before being pitched overseas.
The operating system is reportedly built on top of the Sailfish OS, a production of Finnish company Jolla, which was formed by former Nokia engineers.
The boots-on-the-ground work comes a year Moscow said it wanted its own operating system because they're held to be strategically useful in a post-Snowden world.
Developers are sought with a variety of skill sets and at least three years experience. ®
Michael Bloomberg wants to return to being a mayor – but in London, not New York, according to reports.
The three-time New York mayor is "considering" standing as the Tory candidate to be mayor of London in 2016, unnamed friends told The Sunday Times .
However, a close aide of Mr Bloomberg later distanced the billionaire businessman, three-time New York mayor and philanthropist from a move to London.
Mr Bloomberg, 73, was given an honorary knighthood by the Queen last year for his charity work in Britain, and is on the boards of the Serpentine gallery and Old Vic theatre.
He has a £20 million house in Knightsbridge and has previously referred to London as his "second home".
If it were to happen, Mr Bloomberg would be replacing his friend Boris Johnson, who was himself born in America, and who joked two years ago that the pair should do a "job swap".

Steve Hilton, former adviser to David Cameron, told The Sunday Times: "It would be an incredible coup for London if Mike Bloomberg could be persuaded to run for mayor here. His kind of pragmatic, problem-solving leadership is exactly what London needs."
If Mr Bloomberg were to run, he would need fast track citizenship – which usually takes five years. However, a Conservative Party source told The Sunday Times that they "don't think it would be a problem" – because Mr Bloomberg has invested more than £500 million in Britain, the paper reported.

However, Mr Bloomberg's former deputy mayor, Howard Wolfson, poured cold water on the prospect of a Bloomberg run for (London's) City Hall.
"You can quote me on the record ruling it out," he told the New York Post.
"He is flattered, but he loves New York City too much to leave it – and knows how tough it will be for anyone to follow Boris."
DOUGLAS, Ariz. — Mexican authorities believe that a stolen truck outfitted with a cannon and parked near the U.S.-Mexico border was used to launch items into Douglas, Arizona.
Federal police found the van parked in a street in Agua Prieta, Mexico, which borders with Douglas, last week. The van was reported stolen out of Hermosillo over the summer.
Photos provided by Mexican authorities show a black van with a giant cannon coming out of it.
Drug smugglers have used similar methods in the past, including using catapults to literally send drugs flying over the border.
Border Patrol spokesman Vicente Paco said the most common method is throwing softball-sized marijuana packages over the border fence that are picked up by smugglers on the U.S. side.
He said finding cannons is rare and only happens every couple of years.
Trump's strategy: Where he says he can win
Donald Trump is not a conventional politician.
And his path to the White House may not be very conventional either.
He's hinting at a path to 270 electoral votes that would redraw the electoral map, taking him to victory through some states that haven't gone Republican since George H.W. Bush nearly swept the map in his 1988 bid.
Presidential nominees typically focus on a handful of so-called battleground states, those that political observers and campaign strategists believe can tip either way in November. They largely take for granted that the rest of the map is predictable -- Texas for Republicans and California for Democrats, for example.
But Trump has claimed he can shake up that math by winning least eight states that CNN has categorized as either likely or solidly Democratic.
He's also projected confidence he'll pocket Florida and Ohio. Those states are historically the two most hotly-contested battlegrounds and are the largest prizes among the nine toss-ups on this year's map.

Can you believe this? Does this get you riled up? You need to take a gander at this new commercial for Mazda's CX-5, an advertising partner for Universal Pictures Dr. Suess' "The Lorax". It's the latest, most outrageous act of Hollywood greed.
"Certified Truffula Tree Friendly"?! I can't tell you how sick that "endorsement" makes me.
Back when I was 5 years old, "The Lorax" tv special first aired in 1972. It was a powerful environmental message that I believe helped shape who I've become today. Yes, sure I'd rather have more cars be as environmentally friendly as possible, but that is not the point here and to allow Mazda to sponsor THIS film is just plain blasphemy.
Universal Pictures and the films producers have completely made a mockery of Dr. Seuss' work. Seriously.
What do you think?
Bollywood is always known for its saga of family drams and romantic stories with happy endings. Yet, now and then, non-conventional plot has drawn controversies as well as applause. Time and again, filmmakers have walked the extra mile in choosing subjects that has drawn criticism and the wrath of both public and some political parties.
Boom News lists some of the movies that stirred controversy across India owing to political pressure. While some of these movies were released later amidst hype and fanfare and went on to become blockbusters, others never saw the light of the day.
Aandhi
The film is said to be loosely based on the life of India's first woman Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The film was released at the time when Gandhi imposed emergency in the country. The main protagonist of the movie, played by SuchitraSen, is believed to have a striking resemblance to Mrs. Gandhi. From the sari she wore to the makeup with a grey streakto the walking style and speech delivery, it is said that Suchitra looked almost like the former Prime Minister. The film was banned initially because it had a few scenes depicting the main lead smoking and drinking. Interestingly, the ban was later removed after Inder Kumar Gujral, who was then the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Minister, saw the movie. He was convinced by the movie and gave a clean chit saying the movie draws no parallels with the life of Mrs. Gandhi.
Release Date: February 13, 1975
Film Cast:Sanjeev Kumar, Suchitra Sen
Director:Gulzar
Verdict: Super Hit
Kissa Kursi Ka
Said to be loosely based on the life of Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay Gandhi, Kissa Kursi Ka was also released during the state of emergency. The movie had dialogues like: “Sir, give this young man the licence to manufacture small cars because he learnt it in his mother's womb”, meant it took on Sanjay Gandhi, the most powerful man of India at that time. In the film, the main political party had a ‘people's car' as its election symbol, an obvious take-off on Sanjay's Maruti car project.
Subsequently, a show-cause notice was served to the producer of the movie with 51 objection sby the I&B ministry. The Government confiscated all prints of the movie and burnt them. Sanjay Gandhi was jailed for a month in the following case, and was later released on bail.
Release Date: 16 Febuary, 1978
Film Cast: Shabana Azmi, Raj Babbar, Utpal Dutt
Director: Amrit Nahata
Verdict: Banned after initial release
My Name is Khan
Amidst much controversy when My Name is Khan released, the film raked in the moolah. Apparently, the harassment of Shah Rukh Khan by an immigration officer in America came at the time when the film was due for release, which co-incidentally was about the treatment meted out by Americans to Muslims. Also, just before the release of the movie, SRK had a tussle with Shiv Sena when he made a comment about Pakistani cricket players not being allowed to play in IPL. As a result, there were attacks on cinemas and booking centres across Mumbai.
Release Date: 10 August, 2010
Film Cast:Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol
Director: Karan Johar
Verdict: SuperHit
Madras Café
The film, produced by actor John Abraham who also played the lead role, had its share of controversy too. Based on the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Madras Caféfaced lot of flak from Tamil Nadu's Naam Tamizar and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) for its depiction of post-civil war Sri Lanka. The film was eventually released among these controversies and went to become one of the most talked about movie of John Abraham's career. The film was later dubbed in Tamil to be exclusively released in Tamil Nadu.
Release Date: 23rd August 2013
Film Cast: John Abraham, Nargis Fakri
Director:ShoojitSircar
Verdict: Average
Black Friday
A cinematic adaptation of S. Hussain Zaidi's book about the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts, Black Friday did not see the light in theaters for two years. On the eve of its release, a petition seeking a stay was filed by the people named in the film, the alleged perpetrators of the crime. Since the verdict was still pending for the 1993 case, they argued that the film would bias public opinion against them and affect the court's decision, an argument that was ultimately upheld by the court. The movie was released only after two years.

Anaheim Ducks Accused of Abusing Jewish Player
hockey player drafted by theis suing the team -- claiming coaches within the organization launched multiple "verbal anti-Semitic attacks" ... TMZ has learned.23-year-old-- a 3rd round NHL pick in 2005 -- claims from the moment the Ducks assigned him to play for an affiliate team called the... his coaches unleashed a "barrage of anti-Semitic, offensive and degrading verbal attacks."In the suit, filed today in Orange County Superior Court, Bailey claims the head coach of the Condors told him "[Jews] only care about money and who's who" and that he "never wanted his son to be raised Jewish or to wear a Yarmulke."Bailey claims the assistant head coach would get in on the Jew-bashing too -- saying things like, "Oh, I just got a friend request from a dirty Jew."Bailey says the coaches also forced him to travel apart from the team and he was "rarely given any ice time" in games because he's Jewish.According to the documents, filed by Bailey's powerhouse lawyer, Bailey complained to the Ducks about the hostile work environment -- and the team reacted by instructing the coaches to pen apology letters to Bailey in which they both admitted to using hurtful language.Bailey was eventually traded to the Ottawa Senators in 2009 -- and insists the Ducks were "happy to be rid of him."Bailey is suing for unspecified damages.Calls to the Ducks have not been returned.
Starting next year, Carlos Moya will be leading the Rafael Nadal team. He says there will not be many changes in the coaching pattern of Rafa. After winning numerous titles together, Uncle Toni will be stepping down from his coaching duties. Now, Moya will pick up where Uncle Toni left off. Moya will join Francis Roig to spearhead the Nadal coaching team.
However, Carlos Moya, has made it clear that he will not be making any major changes in the style of Rafa's play. ‘We are speaking about an experienced player who is 31 years old and who knows what he needs to do. He relies on us only to provide information', said Carlos Moya.
Carlos Moya was his country's Davis cup captain for a year, and has also worked with the Canadian player Milos Raonic, propelling him to world number three. Moya says he never thought he would get the opportunity to work with the Spaniard. ‘I thought Nadal would end up with his usual team. He doesn't like changes', said Carlos Moya. Moya has been very close with Rafa since a long time, and has been a good friend, but now it will be more of a professional relationship.
‘It's very different than being Davis cup captain. There you handle a group because everyone has his own coach. Being Raonic or Nadal's coach makes, you have a bigger influence. You spend more time with him living day by day', says Moya. It will be interesting to see how Rafa performs in his early months with Carlos Moya, and what changes Carlo Moya brings to Rafa's overall playing style.
INDIANAPOLIS -- The unthinkable suddenly seems possible in Indianapolis -- opening the season without Peyton Manning.
The four-time league-MVP who has never missed a start in his NFL career is doubtful for Sunday's game at Houston because of lingering soreness in his back following offseason neck surgery. If Manning sits, it would be the first time the NFL's active iron man missed a meaningful game after 227 consecutive starts including the playoffs.
Manning's triceps strength has plateaued and he doesn't have the arm strength right now, sources told ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen. Manning also had some back soreness that worsened during the weekend.
The Colts currently have no plans to attempt another surgery on Manning's neck, a source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.
"I hate it for Peyton," said Pro Bowl center Jeff Saturday, one of Manning's closest friends. "You want him to be healthy, you want him to be back, but you want him to take care of it, too. It's sad when players face tough times, but I know he's strong enough to get through it."
The question is whether the Colts can survive without their franchise quarterback, whose streak stands second in NFL history to Brett Favre's among all QBs.
His 208 consecutive regular-season starts are the most among active players. If Manning can't start Sunday, Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback Ronde Barber, who has started 179 straight games, would take over the top spot if he starts Sunday against the Detroit Lions.
Manning has been the Colts' only starting quarterback for the last 13 years. Over that span, the Chicago Bears have started 17 different quarterbacks, the most of any NFL team. Every team other than the Colts has had at least three different starting quarterbacks during that span.
House Republicans are facing a major split on ObamaCare repeal that threatens to stall the effort.
Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus late Monday vowed to oppose any ObamaCare repeal bill that doesn't go as far as what Congress passed in 2015.
But the bill being pushed by the Freedom Caucus would repeal ­­ObamaCare's expansion of Medicaid, an option that centrist Republicans are wary of supporting, particularly in the Senate.
Asked about the Freedom Caucus's demand to simply pass the 2015 repeal bill again, Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said he didn't think it would attract enough votes to pass.

Upton, like many other more centrist lawmakers, argues Republicans should work out a replacement plan before voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
“I think it becomes a math problem to get [a majority vote] if people don't know what that replacement piece looks like, so the idea of we'll repeal it, trust us, doesn't have a lot of weight,” Upton said.
The emerging divide is a major test for Republican leaders. Unless they can bridge the gap, it's unclear how an ObamaCare repeal bill can pass as scheduled this spring.
The Freedom Caucus has roughly 40 members — enough votes to stop legislation in its tracks if Democrats are united in opposition.
In the Senate, meanwhile, Republicans have only a slim, two-seat majority, and several members have major reservations about repealing the Medicaid expansion.
Some Democrats are hoping the GOP divisions mean ObamaCare repeal will never pass.
“This is very big,” Jon Favreau, a former aide to President Obama, wrote on Twitter of the Freedom Caucus's stance. “GOP doesn't have enough votes in the Senate to end Medicaid expansion, which means they wouldn't be able to pass anything.”
With the path ahead uncertain, Vice President Pence met Tuesday with Upton and the “Tuesday Group” of centrist Republicans in Congress. Upton said that in the meeting, Pence “reaffirmed the idea that the replacement piece ought to be part of repeal; people ought to know what's going on.”
House Republican leaders are planning to include some elements of replacement in their repeal bill, including tax credits, an expansion of Health Savings Accounts, changes to Medicaid and high-risk pool funding.
House conservatives are open to some of those ideas but want to pass a repeal bill quickly. Elements of a replacement, they say, could be handled in a separate bill.
Conservative Rep. Trent Franks Harold (Trent) Trent FranksArizona New Members 2019 Cook shifts 8 House races toward Dems Freedom Caucus members see openings in leadership MORE (R-Ariz.), leaving a Freedom Caucus meeting Monday night, said he feared that the repeal effort is in “mortal danger” and warned against Republican senators and other lawmakers backing down from their repeal promise.
“If there's any excuse possible, now that we're shooting real ammunition, there are maybe some people that will get weak-kneed,” Franks said.
The Senate is moving slower than the House, and is where the 2015 repeal bill could face particular difficulty.
“I think it's impractical to say — they're saying repeal everything, even those things the parliamentarian says we can't repeal, and then put them back in place,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said Tuesday when asked about the Freedom Caucus's position. “It's an incredibly inefficient process, which gives power to the folks who want to say no. I think we want to give power to the folks who want to say yes.”
Cassidy has sponsored a bill that would give states the option of keeping ObamaCare. That measure has drawn fierce opposition from conservatives.
Sen. Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderPence meeting with Senate GOP ahead of vote to block emergency declaration Addressing repair backlog at national parks can give Congress a big win The Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump MORE (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, has talked of the need for a methodical, pragmatic approach that he dubs “repair” of ObamaCare, rather than “repeal,” a far cry from conservatives' goal.
Dan Holler, vice president of the conservative group Heritage Action, sought to dial up the pressure on Alexander Tuesday. He noted that the Tennessee Republican — like 51 other Republicans — voted for the repeal bill in 2015.
“[Alexander's] plan is sort of a nonstarter in the House, and he voted for the 2015 bill that President Obama vetoed,” Holler said.

How to deal with the expansion of Medicaid is one of the thorniest issues that Republicans face. Many Republican senators, and some House members as well, come from states that expanded the program and want to protect it in some form.
Sen. Rob Portman Robert (Rob) Jones PortmanAddressing repair backlog at national parks can give Congress a big win Texas senator introduces bill to produce coin honoring Bushes GOP Green New Deal stunt is a great deal for Democrats MORE (R-Ohio) last week hosted a meeting of Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid to discuss the issue, and Upton said he raised it during the meeting with Pence.
“I specifically talked about Medicaid-expansion states,” Upton said. “In Michigan we have 600,000 Michiganders [enrolled] and so we need to find a way to resolve this, and I actually think we're making some progress.”

The 2015 repeal bill scrapped ObamaCare's mandates and taxes; its subsidies to help people afford coverage; and its Medicaid expansion.
"We're playing with live rounds this time,” said centrist Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). “We're playing with live rounds and we have to have a fully developed replacement plan."

… And there are a lot of bad heroin-smuggling plans out there. Witness: California resident Donald Dennehy hoped to get some heroin to his son in prison in Colorado, so his son could sell it to fellow inmates. According to the Smoking Gun, Papa Dennehy decided the best way to do this would be to somehow get the heroin into his son's mouth so he could swallow it. Then his son (also named Donald) would wait until he passed the heroin through his system and collect it later when it came out the other side. Gross, right? You don't even know the half of it. When the Donald Dennehys couldn't find a woman without a prison record to come in and pass the heroin from her mouth into the son's mouth through a passionate-seeming kiss, Dad Donald decided he'd do it.
Now, this was a sizable item — a finger-size lump of black-tar heroin, so this would have to be a serious father-son make-out session. But how to get the drugs into the prison? After all, Dad Donald would have to fill out papers and talk to officials, and he couldn't very well do that with a big bag o' heroin in his mouth. And since he'd be searched on the way in, well, he didn't have much choice. He shoved it up his butt.
Just to sum it up for you: The plan was for the heroin to go from anus to mouth, to mouth, and then all the way to anus again. Luckily for everyone involved, the Donalds made this plan over the phone. These two criminal masterminds are apparently the only two people left in America who don't know that calls to inmates are tapped, and prison officials stopped the ghastly plan before it could be put into action, searching Dad Donald until they found the drugs protruding — oh, never mind. Anyway, if they had succeeded, it would have netted the duo a whopping $22,000.
We're pretty sure it wouldn't have been worth it.
If you have seen Time Warner Cable News (formerly YNN and Capital News 9) there is a very good chance that you have seen the lovely and talented Kate Welshofer. Not only is Kate bringing you the latest Albany, NY news, but she's also making us laugh on YouTube.
It was a few months ago that I started to follow her Web Series called No Teleprompter No Mercy, and I have to say this is a very different side to the normal series newscaster.
I think when we think of “news people” we usually think of them as buttoned up stuffy people. Kate is anything but, and her videos are hysterical. One of my favorite parts is that her cat makes guest appearances. As a male “cat lady”, I can really relate. I takes on pop culture are great, and this has quickly become one of my favorite subscriptions on YouTube.

Co parenting can be a daunting task and while every situation is different there are still ways to make a better co parent and hopefully help ease your day-to-day tension with your ex spouse!
Tip #1 Learn to be present for your children no matter what. When you are constantly focused on arguing and speaking negatively about the other parent (which you should never do in front of your child) you are actually not truly present for your children. Spend your time and attention focusing on them, your love for them and everything that has to do with them. You will find a lot more peace prioritizing your time when you are with them if you can keep the focus on what is important.
Tip #2 Learn to accept what you can not control. You will drive yourself absolutely nuts if you can not accept what IS reality. If your ex partner has a new spouse, you can not control that situation, therefore you should take the necessary steps possible to learn to accept them. (Read How to become friends with the baby mama if you are the new spouse for more tips on the main page.) Although you ARE the baby mama the foundation is still the same. Other things you will not be able to control is the other parent's way of doing things. The best thing to do is learn how to communicate with them to get on the same page. The best way to achieve what you want from them is to approach the situation in the most mature, calm way that does not involve trying to "tell" them what to do. Trust me that does not work. Try asking them what type of stuff they do at their house and see how you might be able to do the same. By approaching it with what "they do" first you are planting the seed to be able to drop in what you do at your house.
Tip #3 Try to keep your house as calm as possible. The children might already be having a hard time with the transition of their new normal, so by offering them a calm and secure place you can help them feel less stressed. Also, any other chaos in the home should be dealt with and eliminated. If you have a new spouse who is kind of loud, obnoxious and not really benefiting your children then you should probably reconsider how this might be effecting your children while they are with you. Although these are simple examples and may not apply to you, ask yourself this question: Are there things going on in my house that might add stress? If the answer is yes, then simply try to eliminate that thing or those people. As a parent, we know it is all about the children.
Tip #4 Focus on what is going great. When co parenting, often times we point out all the things we don't like about what the other parent is doing. That energy can roll out into larger issues so learn to change paces in order to create GOOD energy that will roll out into larger things. If the parent is on time, make a positive comment about that. Not in a condescending way but make it also about you, for example, " I am glad we are BOTH working hard to stick to our schedule. I know it's hard sometimes but I think were BOTH doing pretty darn good." This positive comment will leave you feeling a little happier for the next time. Constantly add a good comment each time and eventually they will say nicer things and you will be shocked at how easy this tip can shift your relationship.
I bought this book and it hands down was worth every penny, not to mention it is cheap. I recommend this book so anyone who is co parenting. It has amazing tips and tricks and goes deep into details in order to truly help you.
The CoParenting Toolkit: The Essential Supplement for Mom's House, Dad's House
Stay strong and keep on keeping on, you got this!
Pope Francis has established a new path to canonization as a saint, adding the “free and voluntary offering of one's life” to the three previously recognized ways to sainthood.
In a new letter bearing the Latin title Maiorem hac Dilectionem, taken from Jesus' words that “no one has greater love than the one who lays down his life for his friends,” the Pope has cleared the way to official sainthood for those lay down their lives for someone else out of Christian love in imitation of Jesus Christ.
Until now, the two ordinary ways to being declared a saint were martyrdom for Christ and the practice of “heroic virtue.” A third, exceptional way also existed: that of “ancient veneration” of a person as a saint.
According to Catholic teaching, every person who goes to heaven is a saint, but a small percentage of these are officially recognized as saints and put forward as examples and models of a closer following of Christ.
The new decision follows on a process carried out by the Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which asked “whether those servants of God are not worthy of beatification who, inspired by the example of Christ, freely and deliberately offered and sacrificed their lives for their brothers and sisters in a supreme act of charity.”
While this new “fourth way” of the offering of one's life closely resembles both the path of martyrdom and that of heroic virtue in certain respects, it has been put forward to underscore a specific form of heroic Christian witness.
While resembling martyrdom in the aspect of heroic self-giving up to death, it differs because there is no persecutor who puts the Christian to death out of hatred for the faith.
A typical example of this new path to sainthood was the case of the Polish Saint Maximilian Kolbe, who freely offered his life in the Auschwitz concentration camp to save another inmate who had been condemned to death.
Kolbe, a Franciscan priest, was arrested by the Gestapo on February 17, 1941 for the crime of harboring Jews. Soon after, he was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp as prisoner #16670, where he was sentenced to heavy labor.
In July of 1941, the Deputy Commander of Auschwitz ordered 10 men to be chosen at random to be starved to death in an underground bunker, in punishment for three prisoners having escaped from the camp.
When Franciszek Gajowniczek heard that he had been selected, he cried out “My wife! My children!” At this point, Kolbe stepped forward and volunteered to die in his place.
“I am a Catholic priest from Poland; I would like to take his place, because he has a wife and children,” Kolbe said.
When Pope John Paul II canonized Maximilian Kolbe in 1982, he departed from protocol and declared Kolbe to be a “martyr,” rather than a “confessor.” According to the new Vatican disposition, Kolbe would have been declared a saint for the fact of offering his life for another.
Kolbe is the patron saint of the pro-life movement, and was declared by Pope John Paul to be “the patron saint of our difficult century.”
Kolbe's canonization was attended by Franciszek Gajowniczek, by this time in his 90's – the man whose place Father Maximilian took in the death cell at Auschwitz.

Now that we've factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops' overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings.
Consumer Reports is out with an updated report on the 2016 MacBook Pro, and following retesting, the magazine is now recommending Apple's latest notebooks.In the new test, conducted running a beta version of macOS that fixes the Safari-related bug that caused erratic battery life in the original test, all three MacBook Pro models "performed well."The 13-inch model without a Touch Bar had an average battery life of 18.75 hours, the 13-inch model with a Touch Bar lasted for 15.25 hours on average, and the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar had an average battery life of 17.25 hours.Consumer Reports originally denied the 2016 MacBook Pro a purchase recommendation in late December due to extreme battery life variance that didn't match up with Apple's 10 hour battery life claim.Apple worked with Consumer Reports to figure out why the magazine encountered battery life issues, which led to the discovery of an obscure Safari caching bug. Consumer Reports used a developer setting to turn off Safari caching, triggering an "obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons" that drained excessive battery.The bug, fixed by Apple in macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta 3, is not one the average user will encounter as most people don't turn off the Safari caching option, but it's something done in all Consumer Reports tests to ensure uniform testing conditions. A fix for the issue will be available to the general public when macOS Sierra 10.12.3 is released, but users can get it now by signing up for Apple's beta testing program.Each of the three 2016 MacBook Pro models, including the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, and the 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with Touch Bars, are advertised as achieving 10 hours of battery life on a single charge when watching iTunes movies or browsing the web.Real life Battery usage can vary significantly, however, based on factors like screen brightness and the applications being used.
Andrew Leonard says about our post: "nowhere in the post is it even mentioned that G.E. is a major player in the global wind turbine industry, a fact that makes the report from its Energy Financial Services subsidiary ridiculously self-serving." He has a point. We regret the error.
In case anyone needs some economic arguments as to why the renewable energy incentives stalled in the Senate should go forward: A new study released by GE Energy Financial Services provides some solid evidence that it isn't just clean energy which is created by wind farms.
Wind farms bring in additional tax revenue
The report estimates that in addition to $15 million in state taxes per year during construction, $6 million in local property taxes and $1.5 million per year in state income taxes would continue indefinitely after construction. Sales taxes were not calculated in this study but would obviously add to the state tax benefits.
This is on top of federal taxes: GE model's show that the total Net Present Value to the US Treasury of wind farms built in 2007 was $2.75 billion, while the total cost of the Production Tax Credits used to incentivize these farms' construction was $2.5 billion. The result is a net inflow to the US Treasury of $250 million.
Job creation increases in short and long term
Additionally, the report states that it is estimated that 17,200 jobs are created per project during construction and 1,600 long-term jobs are generated per project when the farm is in operation.
Now, the next time someone tries to tell you that we shouldn't be subsidizing renewable energy you got some statistics to throw at them instead of the usual (but true) "the fossil fuel industry is heavily subsidized, so why not alternative energy?"

Bullied by a 16-year-old boy, who posted offensive material online, the 14-year-old girl hung herself at her Kandivli residence; victim's father says they had approached cops four days ago but they did not take note
Bullied by a 16-year-old boy, who posted offensive material online, the 14-year-old girl hung herself at her Kandivli residence; victim's father says they had approached cops four days ago but they did not take note
A 14-year-old girl ended her life yesterday after she couldn't bear the online bullying anymore on a social networking website. The minor took the drastic step after she was tormented and stalked by a boy, who posted offensive material on her online account.
According to the Kandivli police, the Std IX student was a resident of Iraniwadi in Kandivli (W). Police said they received a call at 6 pm and when they reached the spot they found the teenager hanging in her bedroom. The girl's mother told the cops that her daughter was studying in her bedroom, while she was seated in the living room. At 6 pm when she called out to her, she did not get any response and then began to knock on the locked door.
She then called her husband who broke open the door and found the girl hanging. “We have sent the body for a post-mortem,” said H Pimple, senior police inspector of Kandivli police station.
Police negligence?
The girl's father told the police that a 16-year-old boy had been posting obscene messages on his daughter's social networking account since the past few days. Four days ago, he had approached the local police station with his daughter to lodge a complaint, fearing that the boy would harm her. The father alleges that the police had shown no interest in the matter, and they had to return without filing a complaint. The father believes that the boy may have sent disturbing messages to his daughter yesterday, following which she may have killed herself. “We have identified the boy and will question him. We are also examining the girl's social networking account to substantiate the claims of the girl's father. We are also probing whether the negligence of police officials led to the father and the girl returning without lodging a complaint. We have registered a case of unnatural death,” added Pimple.
Previous case of police apathy
As reported in MiD DAY yesterday, two police officers attached to the Dindoshi police station were suspended on Monday for negligence of duty in connection with the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl earlier this month. Following a departmental inquiry, it came to light that the duo had shirked their responsibilities when the survivor had first approached the police station to lodge a sexual harassment complaint on November 2.
“Aww, gee shucks, mister, but you said December was the month of no mercy! Gosh and golly, talkin' about how writers help other writers doesn't sound too merciless, now does it?”
Oh, shut up, Beaver. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. This is the month of my boot shattering your penmonkey jaw and then I dance on your body and crush your chest with the weight of my blowhard advice.
But c'mon, son. It's Christmas week. It's time to spread a little holly jolly cheer.
Time to soak ourselves in Egg Nog and dance on tables, urinating nutmeggy love into one another's eyes.
Um. … yeah. Let's just move onto the list.
Here, then, are ways for writers to help other writers. Please to enjoy.
(And add your own in the comments!)
1. Buy Books
Writers don't have to work very hard to get free books. It's almost eerie — sometimes you swivel your office chair and there, on the floor behind you, is a book you never bought, a book not-yet-released, and the book whispers to you. Read me, it hisses. So, it's important to make sure you spend some coin on books. Books by authors you know. Books by authors you don't. Support individuals and support the ecosystem. I don't need to tell you this — I don't know a single writer who doesn't buy a small freighter-load of new books every year — but, it's worth mentioning just the same. Books, like puppies and wayward elves, need homes.
2. Tell Others To Buy The Books
For some fucking goofy-ass reason, people listen to writers. They think we know shit. (Uhh, and we totally do, heh-heh! Um. Yeah. *distracts you with a shiny tree ornament*) The assumption is that writers write books and so, writers are authorities on things like, say, books. So, when you read a good book, share the love. Doesn't need to be #fridayreads, either — spread the gospel however you can, whenever you can.
3. Give Away Their Books
Someone not convinced that your authorial recommendations are made of gold? BOOM. FACE. Give them a book. Maybe that means giving them a book off your shelf by a writer you know and love. Maybe it means gifting them the book (and these days, gifting e-books is getting hella easy, so why not?). Sometimes it's not about the book sale but the gentle pivoting of new readers toward favorite writers. Best way to do that is to lead by example: “Here is a book. You will read it. I have a gun.”
4. Offer To Read
We all have scripts and books and poetry and all manner of the written word that exists without reflection — we write it and we've no idea how it really is. It helps to have others take a look at it, see if we're crazy, or geniuses, or crazy geniuses, or whether we're just, y'know, pudding-brained dipshits. Sometimes it helps to have a fellow writer with all her writerly skills at the fore to come take a look inside the monster and see if and how the beast purrs — or if it's just coughing up a mucusy hairball. *kack*
5. Sweet, Sweet Blurbage
I've recently gone out asking for blurbs, re: BLACKBIRDS, and boy howdy is it a shameless booty-shake — you're saying, “Here, please carve time out of your life to read my novel of dubious distinction and then provide me with not just your thoughts but your thoughts distilled down into market-savvy nuggets of book-selling goodness.” Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily bad for the blurber — hell, I've had the chance to blurb three novels recently (Forbeck's CARPATHIA, Blackmoore's CITY OF THE LOST, Christopher's EMPIRE STATE) that reminded me why I love books in the first place. So, as a writer, be nice and offer blurbs where possible. I mean, don't blurb a novel you don't like (or, worse, haven't read), but if you're into it — blurb it. And man, “blurb” is a strange word. I AM EMPEROR BLURB OF PLANET BLURB BEWARE MY BLURB ARMY! … no, I dunno. I really shouldn't be allowed to write blog posts at 6:00AM on Sunday morning. Someone out there better send me some coffee. And fast.
6. Recommend Them To An Agent
Sure, some authors get agents the old-fashioned way — you write the book, you query, they want the manuscript, they read the manuscript, you send them cookies and bacon and a cigar box full of money and/or embarrassing pictures, and voila, you have an agent. But some agents only work on referrals, and so it behooves some authors — when they find a book-and-author combo they believe in — to recommend that author to an agent. Help forge those relationships.
7. Recommend Them To An Editor
Some writers work with (and require the services of) independent editors — once you find just such an editor, it's like gold in your pocket. Share the wealth, then: tell fellow authors that if they need a good editor, then as it turns out you know just the one. The editor will thank you, too. With a puppy. It's in all the editor-author contracts: each referral gets the author a new puppy. I'm sure I didn't just dream that.
8. Get Them Work
We've all seen them camped out on bridges and beneath underpasses: a grungy rag-worn army of lost penmonkeys holding up signs, “WILL MAKE UP SHIT FOR FOOD,” or “I FOUGHT IN THE SELF-PUBLISHING WARS OF 2012 AND LOST BOTH EYES.” Here, then, is a “teach a man to fish” situation — if you have work to offer or work you're passing on, it's always nice to recommend another writer for that work.
9. Point Them Toward Opportunity
A variant of the above, if you know of a cool opportunity — a nifty anthology, a new lit-blog, a script contest, a chance to write the next Denny's menu — then point them toward it. Share the wealth of possibility.
10. Buy Them A Drink
Whether we're talking a cup of tea, coffee, Tito's vodka or the tears of a grieving unicorn, writers will always always always appreciate a drink procured by a fellow penmonkey.
11. Buy Them A Meal
We've seen the commercials. The Sarah McLachlan music cues up. Aaaarrrms ooooof an Angel… and then we get a parade of images: hungry writers gnawing on manuscripts, caged, wild-eyed and apparently starving. And then you're like, “Man, for a bunch of hungry guys they sure look a little fat.” Never mind that. We'll appreciate a meal from time to time. If you're having a good year, buy a meal. Cosmically and karmically, this should pass its way down: next time you're having a bad year, a writer should appear and procure for you a free meal, too. That's Penmonkey Law. That's Holy Writ. Goddamnit.
12. Buy Them An Annual Health Care Plan
We writers probably have like, scoliosis or scurvy or syphilis and could really use a bestselling author to be our patron saint and buy us a yearly health care plan. I kid, I kid — but here's where I don't kid. Sometimes writers do fall into bad times, and that means they do genuinely need a leg up with medical bills. It's helpful when other writers come to their aid, maybe organizing a fund (small or large) to help cover some costs.
13. Be A Sounding Board
Sometimes writers just want to talk shit out — does this plot work? Is this a good move? Will you listen to my pitch? Do you know anything about this publisher or this studio? Have you seen my pants? Have you seen my shame? Did I leave my shame in the pocket of my pants? Writers uniquely understand other writers, and so it behooves writers to listen to other writers.
14. Advise Them (When They Want Advice)
Sometimes it isn't about listening but actually about offering advice. Writers are uniquely placed to understand the troubles of other writers, so it makes sense to not, you know, ask advice from a plumber or that toothless homeless lady who keeps dead mice in a mason jar. Just the same, unsolicited advice usually isn't appreciated. From anybody. For anybody. Ever. Trust me on this one.
15. Fuck It, Just Talk To Them
It's not always about being a sounding board. Writers are lonely little penmonkeys — we do not travel in packs or tribes or swing from tree to tree with our hooting brethren. Our day-to-day necessitates we operate in relative isolation, and so sometimes we just want to talk. To someone. About anything. Writers talking to other writers means both writers get to emerge from solitary confinement for a little while. That's referred to as a “win-win.” Or maybe an “ook-ook.” I dunno. Don't look at me. I'm not wearing pants.
16. Give Them Space To Crash… At Your Blog
Just as some writers do book tours, they also do blog tours — hopping from blog to blog, exposing themselves (er, not like that, you filthy little scum-badger) to different audiences in order to hopefully gain some new fans and friends and thump their drum without spending tons of bank in the process. Offer up your blog for that purpose to writers you dig and respect if need be. Share the digital space when possible.
17. Give Them Space To Crash… On Your Couch
Like I said: some writers do book tours. Or maybe they need to visit a place to do research or meet with publishers or escape extradition for their crimes against humanity. Either way, it helps from time to time to offer up your couch or a dog-bed or a spider-infested root cellar. I'm not suggesting you run a halfway house or something: your home needn't be an Author Hotel for Wayward Writers. But for friends and colleagues, you'll help them save a little money and likely earn crash-space on their couch if ever needed.
18. Defend Them From Trolls
Writers are sometimes Internet magnets for those Human Canker Sores known as “trolls,” and it helps to have other writers rise to the defense (though, of course, one should always be careful not to feed the trolls, too). Mostly it's just, stand tall for your penmonkey brethren. You feel me?
19. Help Them Hide The Bodies
Sometimes an Internet flame war gets out of control and next thing you know, you've gone and killed a couple guys. We writers are inventive folks, and so it behooves us to bring the full creative weight of our critical thinking skills to bear on the task of helping our author buddies bury some motherfucking bodies. Uhh. I mean, this is all totally metaphorical. Totally. … Unrelated: anybody has a pickup truck?
20. If You Don't Have Anything Nice To Say…
Hey, we all come across books we don't like or writers we don't respect. I've seen writers slag on Stephenie Meyer and Dan Brown — and, trust me, I'm not a fan of either writer. But you get little value out of bagging on other authors, even if they appear to be easy targets. If writers are accepted curators of literary culture, then it pays to point people toward the Good Stuff and instead happily ignore all the Crap Stuff. Do we even need to talk about Dan Brown or Stephenie Meyer? No, we probably don't. Instead use your time to point readers toward awesome writers, instead. Be a fountain, not a drain.
21. Eschew Public Arguments
It's best not to get on hot, sweaty writer-on-writer arguments. Nobody wins when writers fight. Except cats. I don't comprehend the correlation, but whenever writers argue, cats gain more lives. True story!
22. Assist With Technological Challenges
It's like that line from Ferris Bueller: “The Internet moves fast. If you don't stop and learn about the newest coolest thing, you'll be advertising your books on a Myspace page or a Geocities blog while you sink deep into the tar pits with all the other mighty reptiles.” I think that's the quote. Point being, the ground is changing beneath the author's feet these days — from social media to self-publishing, from HTML5 to transmedia, we've things we need to learn and those things will pile up into a wibbly-wobbly heap if it goes unattended. Other writers are equipped to share and teach about this heretical realm.
23. Share Your Penmonkey Experiences
At blogs like this I try to lay down the tracks of my penmonkey experiences — a trail of ink-soaked breadcrumbs not meant to demonstrate the One True Way but rather, to demonstrate one way through the dark forest of the authorial existence. I think it behooves writers to share that kind of information — to entertain, enlighten, and maybe to bring a little data to this otherwise rudderless life.
24. Kill In Their Name
Um. What? I didn't say anything. I'm definitely not, uhh, asking you guys to kill in my name and drape the corpses upon altars made of my books. Totally don't do that. That'd be aweso… awful.
25. Be A Pal, Pal
The world is a tough old bird. It's not that writers have it uniquely terrible — hell, if you believe Forbes magazine, we're some of the happiest job-having folks out there. Just the same, sometimes life throws an extra punch or two and leaves us with a bad review or a dead publishing deal or the other slings and arrows of everyday living. As such, it pays for writers to throw other writers a kind note — in short, just be a pal, pal. This writer thing we do benefits from the loose and uncertain bonds of community, but it's on us to create and confirm that community — we must be self-driven to exit our caves and put on some pants (metaphorically, because, c'mon, fuck pants) and form bonds with other penmonkeys in the name of fellowship. If we want this thing we do to survive and thrive, we do it together, not separate.

Edward Snowden, the former US intelligence contractor who leaked classified documents revealing US internet and phone surveillance, has asked Ecuador for asylum.
The request was confirmed by Ecuador's foreign minister on Twitter.
Mr Snowden had fled the US for Hong Kong but flew out on Sunday morning and is currently in Moscow.
A US extradition request to Hong Kong failed but Washington insists he should now be denied international travel.
The US justice department has called Hong Kong's decision not to arrest Mr Snowden "troubling".
On Sunday, a US official said Washington had contacted "Western Hemisphere" nations that Mr Snowden might travel to, or through.
"The US is advising these governments that Snowden is wanted on felony charges, and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States," the state department official said.
Earlier, Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino, who is in Vietnam, said on Twitter: "The Government of Ecuador has received an asylum request from Edward J. #Snowden."

Wikileaks said in a statement that Mr Snowden was "bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisers from Wikileaks".
Ecuador is already giving political asylum to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who has been sheltering in its London embassy for the past year.
The anti-secrecy group said Mr Snowden's asylum request would be formally processed when he arrived in Ecuador.
Spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told the BBC he believed history would show that the former analyst had performed "a great public service".
Extradition 'incomplete'
The US state department said Mr Snowden's passport had been revoked, saying this was "routine and consistent with US regulations".
However, one US official told the Associated Press that if a senior official in a country or airline ordered it, a country could overlook the lack of a passport.
Hong Kong officials said Mr Snowden had left "on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel" because the US extradition request was incomplete and there was no legal basis to restrict him from departing.

The US justice department said it was "disappointed" that Hong Kong did not arrest Mr Snowden and that it "disagrees" with its reasons for not doing so.
An official said that at no point during talks on Friday did Hong Kong raise issues regarding the sufficiency of the US request.
"In light of this, we find their decision to be particularly troubling," the official said.
Mr Snowden left on Aeroflot flight SU213 and landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport shortly after 17:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Sunday, where he was reportedly picked up by either a Venezuelan or Ecuadorean embassy car.
Reports suggest he will fly out of Russia on an early afternoon flight to the Cuban capital Havana, where he is booked on another flight to Caracas, Venezuela.
Following that route would enable him to fly on to Ecuador without risk of arrest by US authorities.
It is unclear where Mr Snowden currently is, but he is reported to have not left the airport, and the Ecuadorean ambassador was spotted at an airside hotel.
Who is Edward Snowden? Age 30, grew up in North Carolina
Joined army reserves in 2004, discharged four months later, says the Guardian
First job at National Security Agency was as security guard
Worked on IT security at the CIA
Left CIA in 2009 for contract work at NSA for various firms including Booz Allen
Called himself Verax, Latin for "speaking the truth", in exchanges with the Washington Post Profile: Edward Snowden
The US and Ecuador have a joint extradition treaty, but it is not applicable to "crimes or offences of a political character".
The US justice department has said it will seek co-operation from whichever country Mr Snowden arrives in.
But if Mr Snowden ends up in Ecuador, it is going to be extremely difficult for the Americans to get him, the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington reports.
Mr Snowden had left his home in Hawaii after leaking details of his work as an NSA (National Security Agency) analyst and the extensive US surveillance programme to the UK's Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post.
He has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence.
Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. The complaint is dated 14 June - although it was made public only on Friday.
NSA chief Keith Alexander told ABC News on Sunday there had been no warning that Mr Snowden had taken the documents.
"Clearly, the system did not work as it should have," he said.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gen Alexander on ABC News: "He betrayed that confidence and stole some of our secrets"
Gen Alexander also said the spying agency was overhauling its operations to tighten security on contractors.
The leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.
Mr Snowden said earlier that he had decided to speak out after observing "a continuing litany of lies" from senior officials to Congress.
US officials have defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.
They say Prism cannot be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the US, and that it is supervised by judges.
Cork Businessman Ted Cunningham has made two appearances in recent weeks in the Dail and was a guest of controversial TD Luke 'Ming' Flanagan.
Cork Businessman Ted Cunningham has made two appearances in recent weeks in the Dail and was a guest of controversial TD Luke 'Ming' Flanagan.
Mr Flanagan said that Mr Cunningham was in Leinster House to take part in an "anti-corruption group" meeting.
On Tuesday, May 21, Mr Cunningham, the opera-loving Cork-based financial adviser, sat directly above Taoiseach Enda Kenny in the public gallery during Leaders' Questions. Mr Cunningham sat attentively accompanied by two companions during the high-profile exchanges before heading to the Dail canteen.
Last Thursday, Mr Cunningham and two others were led through the house to a meeting room in Agriculture House, where some TDs have their offices.
Speaking to the Sunday Independent a short while later, Mr Flanagan said he signed Mr Cunningham to enable him to attend an "anti-corruption group meeting", which had been organised.

After taking down mapmaker back in May, Google is getting ready to reopen the map editing tool in August.
You may recall the prank on Google Maps in April that displayed an Android bot urinating on the Apple logo in Pakistan after someone managed to get around the mapmaker approval process.
It wasn't the first fiasco of its kind and Google subsequently shuttered the tool, saying it was taking mapmaker down until it had its “moderation system back in action.”
Well, it seems things are back in order as Google has revealed mapmaker will be reopening in August.
In a company blog post Google's mapmaker product manager Pavithra Kanakarajan says that Google will be looking to the users to moderate the service and help fill the gaps that Google can't police itself.
Google will appoint community users in some areas as “Regional Leads,” Kanakarajan says. These people will oversee any edits for their specific areas with occasional input from Google staff.

Bill Withers Returns: Music, Career Advice and Living Life on Your Own Terms
Bill Withers is a man who prefers his life and his music on his own terms. The Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter's last album was released over thirty years ago, and he has no regrets about walking away from a career in music. His back catalog, which include classics like Ain't No Sunshine, Grandma's Hands and Lean on Me, is still as vibrant and influential as it was decades ago.
Bill Withers sits down with Jesse to talk about growing up in coal-mining town in West Virginia, why he didn't dress-up on stage or dance like his contemporaries, and what his relationship to music is like now.

The Outshot: The Kid Spellers of 'Spellbound'
Jesse talks about his great American hero - a kid named Harry Altman from the Academy Award winning film, Spellbound.
Frank Morrison Spillane (; March 9, 1918 – July 17, 2006), better known as Mickey Spillane, was an American crime novelist, whose stories often feature his signature detective character, Mike Hammer. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. Spillane was also an occasional actor, once even playing Hammer himself.[1][2]
Biography [ edit ]
Born in Brooklyn, New York City, and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Spillane was the only child of his Irish bartender father, John Joseph Spillane, and his Scottish mother, Catherine Anne. Spillane attended Erasmus Hall High School, graduating in 1935.[3] He started writing while in high school, briefly attended Fort Hays State College in Kansas and worked a variety of jobs, including summers as a lifeguard at Breezy Point, Queens, and a period as a trampoline artist for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
During World War II Spillane enlisted in the Army Air Corps, becoming a fighter pilot and a flight instructor.[4] While flying over Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, he said, "That is where I want to live."[5] Later, he would use his celebrity status to publicize the Grand Strand on TV, but when it became a popular resort area and traffic became a problem, Spillane said, "I shouldn't have told people about it."[5]

He was an active Jehovah's Witness.[6] Mickey and Mary Ann Spillane had four children (Caroline, Kathy, Michael, Ward), and their marriage ended in 1962. In November 1965, he married his second wife, nightclub singer Sherri Malinou. After that marriage ended in divorce (and a lawsuit) in 1983, Spillane shared his waterfront house in Murrells Inlet with his third wife, Jane Rogers Johnson, whom he married in October 1983, and her two daughters (Jennifer and Margaret Johnson).
In the 1960s, Spillane became a friend of the novelist Ayn Rand. Despite their apparent differences, Rand admired Spillane's literary style, and Spillane became, as he described it, a "fan" of Rand's work.[7]
In 1989, Hurricane Hugo ravaged his Murrells Inlet house to such a degree it had to be almost entirely reconstructed. A television interview showed Spillane standing in the ruins of his house.
He received an Edgar Allan Poe Grand Master Award in 1995. Spillane's novels went out of print, but in 2001, the New American Library began reissuing them.
Spillane died July 17, 2006 at his home in Murrells Inlet, of pancreatic cancer.[8][9][10] After his death, his friend and literary executor, Max Allan Collins, began the task of editing and completing Spillane's unpublished typescripts, beginning with a non-series novel, Dead Street (2007).
In July 2011, the community of Murrells Inlet named U.S 17 Business the "Mickey Spillane Waterfront 17 Highway." The proposal first passed the Georgetown County Council in 2006 while Spillane was still alive, but the South Carolina General Assembly rejected the plan then.[5]
He is survived by his wife, Jane Spillane.
Writing career [ edit ]
Comic books [ edit ]
Spillane started as a writer for comic books. While working as a salesman in Gimbels department store basement in 1940, he met tie salesman Joe Gill, who later found a lifetime career in scripting for Charlton Comics. Gill told Spillane to meet his brother, Ray Gill, who wrote for Funnies Inc., an outfit that packaged comic books for different publishers. Spillane soon began writing an eight-page story every day. He concocted adventures for major 1940s comic book characters, including Captain Marvel, Superman, Batman and Captain America. In the early 1940s, working for Funnies, Inc., he wrote two-page text stories which were syndicated to various comic book publishers, including Timely Comics. At one point, Spillane estimated he wrote fifty of these "short-short stories," which were intended to fulfill a postal regulation requiring comic books to have at least two pages of text to qualify for a second-class mailing permit. While most comic books writers toiled anonymously, Spillane's byline appeared on most of his prose "filler" stories. 26 stories were collected in Primal Spillane: Early Stories 1941-1942 (Gryphon Books, 2003).
Novels [ edit ]
Spillane joined the United States Army Air Corps on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the mid-1940s he was stationed as a flight instructor in Greenwood, Mississippi, where he met and married Mary Ann Pearce in 1945. The couple wanted to buy a country house in the town of Newburgh, New York, 60 miles north of New York City, so Spillane decided to boost his bank account by writing a novel. He wrote I, the Jury in just 19 days. At the suggestion of Ray Gill, he sent it to E. P. Dutton.
With the combined total of the 1947 hardcover and the Signet paperback (December 1948), I, the Jury sold 6-1/2 million copies in the United States alone. I, the Jury introduced Spillane's most famous character, hardboiled detective Mike Hammer. Although tame by current standards, his novels featured more sex than competing titles, and the violence was more overt than the usual detective story. Covers tended to feature scantily-dressed women or women who appeared as if they were about to undress. In the beginning, Mike Hammer's chief nemesis consisted of gangsters, but by the early '50s, with the onset of the Red Scare, this switched to communists.[2] An early version of Spillane's Mike Hammer character, called Mike Danger, was submitted in a script for a detective-themed comic book. " 'Mike Hammer originally started out to be a comic book. I was gonna have a Mike Danger comic book,' [Spillane] said in a 1984 interview."[11] Two Mike Danger comic-book stories were published in 1954 without Spillane's knowledge, as well as one featuring Mike Lancer (1942). These were published with other material in "Byline: Mickey Spillane," edited by Max Allan Collins and Lynn F. Myers, Jr. (Crippen & Landru publishers, 2004).
The Mike Hammer series proved hugely successful during the 1950s-60s, but the books were excoriated by the literary establishment. Malcolm Crowley of The New Republic called Spillane "a dangerous paranoid, sadist, and masochist" and even his own editors sometimes found his novels distasteful. Spillane for his part was unmoved by critics, saying "You can sell a lot more peanuts than caviar" and "The literary world is made of second rate writers writing about other second rate writers". Attractively low prices (25 cents for a paperback copy, later raised to 50 cents) helped sales, and the 1956 informative guide Sixty Years of Best Sellers found that the six novels Spillane had written up to that point were among the top ten best selling American fiction titles of all time.
The Signet paperbacks displayed dramatic front cover illustrations. Lou Kimmel created the cover paintings for My Gun Is Quick, Vengeance Is Mine, One Lonely Night and The Long Wait. The cover art for Kiss Me, Deadly was by James Meese.

Acting [ edit ]
Spillane portrayed himself as a detective in Ring of Fear (1954), and rewrote the film without credit for John Wayne's and Robert Fellows' Wayne-Fellows Productions. The film was directed by screenwriter James Edward Grant. Several Hammer novels were made into movies, including Kiss Me Deadly (1955). In The Girl Hunters (1963) filmed in England, Spillane himself appeared as Hammer, one of the few occasions in film history in which an author of a popular literary hero has portrayed his own character. Spillane was scheduled to film The Snake as a follow-up, but the film was never made.[13]
On October 25, 1956, Spillane appeared on The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, with interest on his Mike Hammer novels.[14] In January 1974, he appeared with Jack Cassidy in the television series Columbo in the episode Publish or Perish. He portrayed a writer who is murdered.[15]
In 1969, Spillane formed a production company with Robert Fellows who had produced The Girl Hunters to produce many of his books, but Fellows died soon after and only The Delta Factor was produced.[16]
During the 1980s, he appeared in Miller Lite beer commercials.[17] In the 1990s, Spillane licensed one of his characters to Tekno Comix for use in a science-fiction adventure series, Mike Danger. In his introduction to the series, Spillane said he had conceived of the character decades earlier but never used him.[11]
Reception [ edit ]
When literary critics had a negative reaction to Spillane's writing, citing the high content of sex and violence, Spillane answered with a few terse comments: "Those big-shot writers could never dig the fact that there are more salted peanuts consumed than caviar... If the public likes you, you're good." Early reaction to Spillane's work was generally hostile: Malcolm Cowley dismissed the Mike Hammer character as "a homicidal paranoiac",[18] John G. Cawelti called Spillane's writing "atrocious",[18] and Julian Symons called Spillane's work "nauseating".[18] By contrast, Ayn Rand publicly praised Spillane's work at a time when critics were almost uniformly hostile. She considered him an underrated if uneven stylist and found congenial the black-and-white morality of the Hammer stories. She later publicly repudiated what she regarded as the amorality of Spillane's Tiger Mann stories.
Spillane's work was later praised by Max Allan Collins, William L. DeAndrea[2] and Robert L. Gale.[18] DeAndrea argued that although Spillane's characters were stereotypes, Spillane had a "flair for fast-action writing", that his work broke new ground for American crime fiction, and that Spillane's prose "is lean and spare and authentically tough, something that writers like Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald never achieved".[2] German painter Markus Lüpertz claimed that Spillane's writing influenced his own work, saying that Spillane ranks as one of the major poets of the 20th century. American comic book writer Frank Miller has mentioned Spillane as an influence for his own hardboiled style. Avant-Garde musician John Zorn composed a piece influenced by Spillane's writing titled Spillane.

North End will be supported by over 4,700 travelling PNE fans at the DW Stadium on Saturday 18th February.
The match also marks four years since manager Simon Grayson was appointed at Deepdale, and he will be looking to build on a successful week so far with back to back victories against Brentford and Birmingham City.
To mark the gaffer's anniversary, the club will be providing the travelling supporters with Simon Grayson masks to show their support for the at the DW Stadium.
The reverse of the masks will be all yellow, so remember to hold yours up as the team come out of the tunnel to create a sea of yellow in the away end!
Last season saw three derby day victories on the road and Simon and his squad will be looking to continue their winning run against Wigan Athletic on Saturday.
On the club's gesture to mark his anniversary, Grayson said: "It will be quite scary to see I suppose! It's a nice idea, I'm not sure who is going to get the blame for this!
"There will be one or two left on the mantelpiece by the parents I think to keep the kids away from the fire.
"But it's nice that the club have done it, though I think it might be best to use the yellow as opposed to the face throughout the course of the match!"
The Latics have also asked the club to inform the travelling fans that there will be no alcohol served at half-time on away end concourses at the DW Stadium.
A reminder that if you missed out on a ticket, you can listen to the game live on PNE PlayerHD where Jonathan Breeze will be joined by Ian Bryson from 2.30pm.
Coach travel is still available for those who have a ticket, and is priced at just £10 for all. Coaches will leave both Deepdale and Leyland at 1pm.

The Wii U has struggled so far, selling 3.91 million units globally since launch, below Nintendo's expectations for the platform. Part of the difficulty of getting the platform off the ground comes down to Nintendo's inability to release games and services that demonstrate the Wii U's novelty relative to the original Wii, president Satoru Iwata has said.
"Except for its backward compatibility with existing Wii software and accessories, we have so far failed to make propositions worthy of Wii U's position as a successor to the Wii system," Iwata said during Nintendo's second quarter financial results briefing.
Wii Sports Club for Wii U and Wii Fit U, sequels to "defining" Wii games, are now available in Japan. These titles should help spur sales in Japan and abroad, but success won't come overnight, Iwata cautioned.
"I remarked a while ago that it is difficult to change our prospects with just one title. Our objective for Wii U for the upcoming year-end sales season will be to dramatically change the environment surrounding Wii U with multiple key titles that can appeal to a wide range of consumers," he said.
The "key title" and "central pillar" for Wii U this holiday season, Iwata said, is Super Mario 3D World, which will be released on November 22. Other games that Nintendo has high hopes for are Wii Party U (ideal to play at New Year's holiday gatherings, Iwata said) and Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games.
Nintendo will also release Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze in December, before high-profile games like Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros. arrive in 2014.
We've open-sourced several of Leverage's top jQuery plugins that help us make our sites more responsive, interactive and easier to create.
As you may or may not know, at Brolik we use a proprietary website framework and CMS for almost all of our projects. It's called Leverage.
Leverage is proprietary (although that could change in the future… hint, hint), but we've open-sourced several of Leverage's top jQuery plugins that help us make our sites more responsive, interactive and easier to create.
The plugins can be used on any site, whether it's built on Leverage or not, so I'd like to explain a little bit about each and encourage you to use one or all in your next project.
I won't get into code examples here, but each of these plugins has documentation online, and of course, feel free to email me at thomasa@brolik.com or tweet me @drewbrolik with any questions.
Let's get into it.
Responsive Img: Make Your Images Responsive Without Creating New Images
responsiveimg.com
Responsive Img provides a dead simple way to improve image performance on responsive websites across all devices, screen sizes and screen resolutions.
Responsive Img is by far Leverage's most popular plugin. The documentation website gets notable traffic, and we see a lot of positive tweets and write-ups about the plugin.
The beauty of Responsive Img is that you can add it to almost any website, without additional markup and without creating additional assets. The plugin takes care of all the hard work by creating and adjusting images automatically, based on browser size and resolution.
The Backstory
Responsive design is immensely popular, and undeniably important to web design. These days, there are a lot of great people doing great things with responsive web design, but there is still a glaring issue we all face: responsive images.
While there are some great solutions out there, most of them require you to implement new and “non-standard” markup in your code and to create additional images for different screen sizes and resolutions.
In practice, there's more to responsive images than serving up smaller, faster loading images for smaller screens. There's also the issue of art direction. Basically, sometimes you might want to crop in on an image when there is less screen real estate, as opposed to just shrinking it.
Furthermore, Retina Displays and other displays with higher pixel density require a larger image (pixel-wise) that gets sized down (physical size-wise) with code.
Recently, there was big news on this front. Srcset was officially added to the webkit spec, meaning that the first major step towards unified, standardized responsive image support is underway. It's a big step, but it doesn't solve all of the important responsive issues yet. More importantly, though, it's only supported by modern webkit browsers.
How Responsive Img Can Help
With Responsive Img, developers and designers can create a single, universal image at a large size or create several versions of an image for different screen sizes. Either way, with one line of jQuery, the plugin takes care of the rest, swapping out images as the page loads or the browser is resized.
In addition, Responsive Img will take screen resolution (read Retina Display) into account when deciding what size images to use or create.
That's right, create. Using PHP, if an image doesn't exist at a certain size, Responsive Img will create that image, on the fly, and serve up the newly optimized image instead. After it's created and stored on the server once, the plugin will switch to that image instead of creating a new one next time.
This is where Responsive Img is different from anything out there, and this is what really saves us and our clients time.
This setup is great for content management systems where the website's images get updated by a non-designer/non-developer. Users can upload a single image, as large as they have it, and the website takes care of all the rest on the front end.
Not only is it great for a CMS, but it's also flexible enough for users who are designers. If a designer uploads two different versions of an image, Responsive Img will use the second version instead of creating a new version of the original image. This means we can art direct and be responsive!
The Final Word
It's immensely important to have responsive images. Load time, especially on mobile phones over data networks, can make or break a website.
Responsive Img gives you all the functionality and intelligence required for handling responsive images, without the need to change pre existing code or code habits. (And that means it's very backwards-compatible.)
Over Under: Hide and Show Elements With Only Class Name (no CSS)
github.com/drewbrolik/Over-Under
Over Under lets you hide or show elements based on class names that contain media query breakpoint values.
It saves you the time of adding a class or an id to an element, adding some styling to CSS and then overwriting that style with a media query for a certain screen size.
This plugin is fairly new to Leverage, but it's all over our code now. Where Responsive Img is a whole new way to tackle a large problem, Over Under is more of a time-saving shortcut that speeds up production and prototyping.
The Backstory
It's a convenient and common responsive design tactic to hide and show elements at different screen sizes. In fact, it's necessary in good responsive design.
In practice, though, it's fairly inconvenient to add a separate media query into the stylesheet for every single element that you want to hide or show. This is especially true if, like us, you create media query breakpoints at more sizes than the standard “mobile” and “tablet” sizes.
How Over Under Works
Over Under allows a developer to hide and show elements based on specific class names that contain a media query breakpoint size. So, adding a class of “over300” to an element means that the element will automatically hide when the browser width is under 300 pixels wide.
Behind the scenes, Over Under actually creates a separate stylesheet containing media queries for all of the “overX” and “underX” classes in the DOM, so it's lightning fast and unaffected by subsequent javascript changes or styling.
The Final Word
Over Under is quick and dirty, but it is effective and immensely time saving. Period.
Scroll CSS: ScrollTop-based jQuery Animations
github.com/drewbrolik/Scroll-CSS
Scroll CSS animates elements based on javascript's scrollTop value. This means that you can have an element fade in, slide out or create a parallax effect by sliding over another element.
All of the animations coincide with the user's scroll position, so animation is extremely “reactive” and works both forwards and backwards, as the user scrolls down a page and then back up.
The Backstory
Interactivity is huge right now. So is user experience and showing the user only what they need right when they need it. For that matter, parallax scrolling effects are also huge right now. This makes sense. As browser and processor technology get better, so does website interaction and user expectation.
We developers need to stay current and create the best experiences we can, but we also need to manage time and budgets.
What Scroll CSS Does
Scroll CSS allows you as a developer to quickly create interesting and responsive interaction, without being a jQuery expert. Call the plugin on an element, and specify which CSS property to animate, the CSS start value, the stop value and the scroll values (by pixel or anchor tag) to begin and end the animation. The plugin takes care of the rest.
With this technique, it's easy to slide a “contact us” button into view when the user scrolls to the end of a section. It's also easy to slide one section of content up over another (a very popular jQuery parallax effect). The best part is, when the user stops scrolling mid-animation, the animation stops as well. If they scroll back up, the animation runs in reverse.
The Final Word
Websites and web-based applications are getting more complex as developers and technology become more advanced. As animation and movement become the standard, you need an easy way to implement little “bells and whistles” without killing the budget.
Scroll CSS is the way.
Until Next Time…
I hope some of these piqued your interest. We love to share what we can, and since these tools help us on a daily basis, it's only fair to give back and share them with the community.
As we create more jQuery plugins, we'd love to share more as well. If you're interested in creating some of your own, see Kyle Jasso's jQuery plugin tutorial in the Brolik Blog.
Until next time, keep improving the web, and so will we.
NICOLA Sturgeon will have to wait until Scotland is half-way out of Europe before holding a second independence referendum, it has emerged.
A draft referendum bill and consultation, published yesterday, indicate that spring 2018 will be the first feasible date that a new vote could be held despite previous speculation that it could take place as early as next year.
Experts said the timetable raises significant doubts over whether Scotland would be able to remain a member of the EU when the UK quits in early 2019, even if voters have backed independence to protect the country's relationship with Europe.
Read more: Scottish Government could pay benefits to older Scots earlier, suggests David Mundell
Ahead of the last referendum, the Scottish Government said it would take 18 months following a Yes vote to become an independent nation. A similar timescale would see Scotland faced with leaving the EU along with the UK, regardless of the second referendum result.
Kirsty Hughes, an EU expert and a member of the Centre on Constitutional Change, has previously said that a new referendum would have to be held and won early next year if Scotland is to remain in the EU, rather than having to go through a more complex process of leaving and re-entering at a later date.
She said that in light of the new timetable, the best Scotland could hope for would be a streamlined process for rejoining the EU, potentially enjoying Norway-style terms before being accepted as a full member within a few years.
Ms Hughes added: "If there was a vote for independence in early 2018 that gives the EU a bit of time to work out how not to disrupt Scotland's place in the EU. I very much doubt Scotland could take on the UK's membership, so the question becomes how to handle the transition. If Scotland is to become a new member state, accession treaties will take a couple of years.
Read more: Scottish Government could pay benefits to older Scots earlier, suggests David Mundell
"With a year's notice and political goodwill on all sides, they could create a straightforward process. There might be some sort of transitional relationship, such as remaining in the EEA. But I don't see any way Scotland becomes independent in early 2019 and is a full member state at that point."
SNP ministers have confirmed that they will have to seek the UK Government's permission to hold a new referendum, with the process largely following precedents leading to the historic 2014 vote, when 55 per cent rejected independence.
A consultation over the draft bill will last until January, and if the First Minister decides to push ahead with another referendum, a Section 30 order will have to be granted by the UK Government before the bill is introduced to Holyrood.
The process for granting a Section 30 Order, which would temporarily transfer powers to hold a legally-binding referendum to Holyrood, took four months over late 2012 and early 2013. A new Edinburgh Agreement between the two Governments, setting out the terms of the vote, may also have to be negotiated.
With finance secretary Derek Mackay confirming that it would take six to nine months for the bill to progress through parliament once introduced, it would be impossible for MSPs to pass it before parliament breaks up for summer recess in July.
While it may be ready after the parliament returns in September, after it passed it would then take another four weeks to receive Royal Assent, assuming it is not challenged in the courts. The Bill specifies that a 16-week 'referendum period' will be held before polling day, pushing the earliest possible referendum date well into 2018.
Read more: Scottish Government could pay benefits to older Scots earlier, suggests David Mundell
There also remains the possibility that the UK Government could block the vote by refusing to grant a Section 30 order. Ms Sturgeon has said it would be "inconceivable" that Theresa May would refuse a request, but Number 10 yesterday said that the First Minister had "no mandate" for another referendum. Asked if UK ministers would reject a call for a second referendum from the Scottish Government, a spokesman stated: "There has not been a call."
The Scottish Government is under no obligation to introduce the Bill to parliament, however, Ms Sturgeon has indicated she will move for a second vote if a string of demands for additional powers for Holyrood, to be revealed within weeks, are not met.
She faced criticism from opposition MSPs after the independence bill proved the first major legislation published by the Scottish Government since the May election, despite previous pledges to make issues such as education and mental health priorities.
Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said: "Nicola Sturgeon stated quite clearly she would only hold another referendum if that's what the people of Scotland want. But the voters were clear in 2014 that they didn't want to break up Britain and poll after poll has shown that support for another divisive referendum is tumbling.
"No matter what else the SNP claims to be passionate about, be it education, health or justice, today's publication exposes its sole objective is separation ahead of anything and everything else."
Google today stopped showing authorship in search results, meaning articles will no longer include a link to the Google+ profile of their author. The company says that it found the information isn't as useful to its users as it hoped, and in some cases even distracts from the overall search results.
The official Authorship in web-search support page merely states “Authorship markup is no longer supported in web search.” Those interested in adding markup to their websites are pointed to rich snippets and structured data.
In June, Google removed authors' Google+ profile pictures from search results. At the time, Google's Webmaster Trends analyst John Mueller said tests showed the change improved click-through rates, a direct contradiction to Google's original thinking.
Mueller is now saying that authorship is neither beneficial nor harmful:
If you're curious — in our tests, removing authorship generally does not seem to reduce traffic to sites. Nor does it increase clicks on ads. We make these kinds of changes to improve our users' experience.
Nevertheless, Google says it will continue showing Google+ posts from friends and pages (when they're relevant to your query) in the main search results and on the right-hand side. Those wishing that Google would finally get rid of Google+ from its main product are out of luck.
Google first unveiled its plan for authorship markup in June 2011. Since then, the company has changed and updated how the feature works on its main service, though only recently has it become clear that it was being deemphasized.
Now that authorship has been dropped completely, webmasters can remove all rel=author markup they have on their site. All the effort adding and maintaining the functionality has now gone out the window, but that's what happens when so many Web properties rely on a single source for driving massive traffic.

Uranium is the fuel most widely used by nuclear power plants for nuclear fission. In nuclear fission, energy is released when atoms are split apart to form smaller atoms. Nuclear power plants use the heat from nuclear fission to produce electricity.
Uranium is a common metal, but it must be processed into a fuel
Uranium is a common metal found in rocks all over the world. Uranium occurs in combination with small amounts of other elements. Economically recoverable uranium deposits have been discovered primarily in the western United States, Australia, Canada, Central Asia, Africa, and South America.
Nuclear power plants use a certain type of uranium, U-235, as fuel because its atoms are easily split apart. Although uranium is about 100 times more common than silver, U-235 is relatively rare.
After uranium is mined, the U-235 must be extracted and processed before it can be used as a fuel. Mined uranium ore typically yields one to four pounds of uranium concentrate (U3O8 or yellowcake) per ton, or 0.05% to 0.20% yellowcake.

After decades of allowing industries to pollute at will all in the name of those handy dandy “free markets” that are wrecking economies around the world, and with a cacophony of individuals from all levels of the economic spectrum crying out that those of us who objected to the rape, plunder and devastation of everything in sight in the name of “profits” was just because we didn't want them to get rich, it comes as no surprise that the devastation has reached a critical level. Only we aren't allowed to blame the core polluters, instead, the general public has been targeted.
As the level of pollution of air, water and food along with the land became more obvious a new movement appeared claiming that man-made global warming was the cause of everything. Man-made was of course, you and me. Our very existence was what was causing the claimed drastic change in the environment. Along came Al gore and his movie “An Inconvenient Truth” that although was quite alarming in its assessments and predictions, turns out wasn't really quite the truth at all. But it was a tremendous catalyst for not only the global warming myth, but also, just the right piece of propaganda to launch the new Cap & Trade.
Global warming appeared everywhere. It was on billboards, in newspaper ads, in magazines, on the radio and TV. Everyone was perched on the edge of their seats waiting for the huge rise in temperatures signaling the arrival of global warming that would surely signal the end of time. And then summer temperatures were actually a few degrees cooler than normal, and the winters some of the worst in recorded history reaching into areas where blizzards, snowfalls and ice storms were virtually unheard of.
In the midst of the global warming that wasn't, came the revelations of what we now know as “Climate-gate”, the release of numerous memo's, emails and other communications detailing just exactly how data was to be manipulated and how to avoid using established protocols in order to produce an “acceptable scientific consensus” that could be sold to the public. This was all done to lay the foundations for the new Cap & Trade that would be foisted on to the public at large while still leaving the pay to pollute system in place for industrial polluters.
Then came this recent revelation reported by Digital Journal on April 01 2011:
In testimony yesterday (March 31, 2011) before the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment Committee on Science, Space and Technology, forecasting expert J. Scott Armstrong of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania testifying: The three researchers audited the forecasting procedures used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose “procedures violated 81% of the 89 relevant forecasting principles,” Armstrong noted. Armstrong and his colleagues recommend Congress end government funding for climate change research as well as other research, government programs, and regulations that assume the planet is warming. They also recommend Congress cease funding organizations that lobby or campaign for global warming. “Based on our analyses, especially with respect to the violations of the principles regarding objectivity and full disclosure,” Armstrong told members of Congress, “we conclude that the manmade global warming alarm is an anti-scientific political movement.” ***********
OMG! Scientific blasphemy! The sad part is this; now Armstrong no matter how illustrious his career has been will be skewered in the media, cursed by the global warming believers and most likely see his career destroyed just for speaking what he knew to be true. That's what we do to people who don't parrot the government approved information. We destroy them and we elevate the deceivers into positions of esteem.
If Armstrong's recommendations are considered, it forces congress to address the actual major cause of pollution generated by pampered industrial corporate donors. Don't hold your breath.
The really unfortunate part of this story is that we all know that congressional hearings of any kind are staged, scripted and meaningless. Even armed with this serious and damning information from an actual expert, nothing will come of this hearing. When the cameras were shut off, all the information went into the nearest wastebasket and congress went to dinner. End of story.
Armstrong's testimony, citing the deception and active avoidance of accepted protocols is the second time that global warming has been exposed for the myth that it is. No doubt those who cling to this myth will call for his head. But hey! We still got Cap & Trade!
They didn't pass Cap & Trade did they?
For those who think Cap & Trade never passed; think again. It passed from congress right over to the Environmental Protection Agency to be implemented by statute and regulations, rather than by congressional voting. This maneuver got congress off the hook and prevented more ill feelings from the public towards them. Once safely in the hands of another of those privately owned federal corporations that siphons money not only off the taxpayers, but which can contract with other corporations against the taxpayers all in the name of corporate profits, could be implemented by nameless and blameless bureaucrats who make their living making everyone's lives miserable with their tendencies to turn a simple solution into an exercise in idiocy.
Because the EPA, just like every other alphabet soup federal corporation, is autonomous it is also free from any meaningful oversight, as it is a privately held corporation. Congress can not tell the EPA what to do, they can only make suggestions about what they would like to see done. Of course congress is quite silent in this matter.
While corporate polluters will be allowed to continue to pollute as much as their bank accounts can stand, you and I will bear the brunt of the costs and oppressive legislative meanderings. After all, it is our fault that we use the products and services of these polluters, therefore, pollution is our fault. Of course if we didn't use their products and services the federal government would just bail them out and we would be forced to subsidize them anyway. Might as well turn the lights on and get some bang for your buck.
In the end we have had to accept that global warming is a contrived and fabricated myth that was launched into the public consciousness with ulterior motives attached. It was a grand plan that has generated mucho amounts of revenue for the fed, and has been the convenient cover for numerous activities that many would prefer you didn't pay attention to. Chemtrailing, open air testing of biological agents and weapons or that all-time favorite HAARP, to name a few.
I doubt congress will pay any attention to Armstrong and his testimony. This global warming/Cap & Trade deal was just too damn lucrative. They aren't going to want to give that up.

"Community club" redirects here. For an organization of homeowners or residents, see neighborhood association
Community centres or community centers are public locations where members of a community tend to gather for group activities, social support, public information, and other purposes. They may sometimes be open for the whole community or for a specialized group within the greater community. Community centres can be religious in nature, such as Christian, Islamic, or Jewish community centres, or can be secular, such as youth clubs.
Uses and activities [ edit ]
Community centres generally perform many (though rarely all) the following functions in its community (Note this list is intended to define which meaning of the phrase community centre is covered by this article rather than being facts about what some other sources associate with that phrases, though adding source confirming that other sources use the phrase in a similar way would be nice).
As the place for all-community celebrations at various occasions and traditions.
As the place for public meetings of the citizens on various issues.
As the place where politicians or other official leaders come to meet the citizens and ask for their opinions, support or votes ("election campaigning" in democracies, other kinds of requests in non-democracies).
As a place where community members meet each other socially.
As a place housing local clubs and volunteer activities.
As a place that community members (and sometimes others), can rent cheaply when a private family function or party is too big for their own home. For instance the non-religious parts of weddings, funerals etc.
As a place that passes on and retells local history.
As a place where local non-government activities are organised.
As a place where indoor circuses can entertain the paying public.
As a place of relief in instances of community tragedies.
Organization and ownership [ edit ]
Around the world (and sometimes within single countries) there appear to be four common ways in which the operation of the kind of community centre are owned and organised[citation needed]. In the following description "Government" may refer to the ordinary secular government or to a dominant religious organisation such as the Roman Catholic Church; and it may refer to the central national or international branch or to the local subdivision of it.
Community owned: The centre is directly owned and run by the local community through an organization separate from the official (local) governmental institutions of the area, but with the full knowledge and sometimes even funding from (local) government institutions. Example: [ citation needed ] .
. Government owned: The centre is a public (local) government facility, though it is mostly used for non-government community activities and may even have some kind of local leadership elected from its community. Example: [ citation needed ] . Kominkan (in Japan)
. Sponsored: A rich citizen or commercial corporation owns the place and donates its use to the community for reasons of charity or public relations. Example:[ citation needed ].
Origins of individual community centres [ edit ]
The DRU Cultuurfabriek in the Netherlands is based on a former iron foundry. The main building was used once for the administration.
Each individual community centre typically has its own peculiar origin and history, though some variants seem to be common[citation needed].
Built as such. Buildings have been erected specifically to function as community centres at least as far back as the 1880, [1] perhaps even earlier.
perhaps even earlier. Disused public building. When an official government building (such as a school or city hall) is no longer needed for its original purpose, it is sometimes offered to the community as gift, loan or sale [ citation needed ] .
. Disused commercial building. When a commercial building of some local importance is no longer used, it is sometimes sold or donated to the community [ citation needed ] .
. Building that served many of the community centre purposes in addition to a different primary use (such as school, church, inn or town hall), which was later acquired so it could continue these functions after its primary use subsided[ citation needed ].
Schools as community centres [ edit ]
Early forms of community centres in the United States were based in schools providing facilities to inner city communities out of school hours. An early celebrated example of this is to be found in Rochester, New York from 1907. Edward J. Ward, a Presbyterian minister, joined the Extension Department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, organizing the Wisconsin Bureau of Civic and Social Development. By 1911 they organized a country-wide conference on schools as social centres. Despite concerns expressed by politicians and public officials that they might provide a focus for alternative political and social activity, the idea was successful. In 1916, with the foundation of the National Community Center Association, the term Community Center was generally used in the US. By 1918 there were community centres in 107 US cities, and in 240 cities by 1924. By 1930 there were nearly 500 centres with more than four million people regularly attending. The first of these was Public School 63, located in the Lower East Side. Clinton Child's, one of the organizers, described it as
"A Community organized about some centre for its own political and social welfare and expression; to peer into its own mind and life, to discover its own social needs and then to meet them, whether they concern the political field, the field of health, of recreation, of education, or of industry; such community organization is necessary if democratic society is to succeed and endure".
In the UK many villages and towns have their own Community Centre, although nearby schools may offer their assembly or dining hall after school for Community Centre activities. For example, local schools near Ouston may host dance, or sporting activities provided by a local community centre.[2]
Grassroot functions [ edit ]
Parks are also considered community centres. Another pioneer of community centres was Mary Parker Follett, who saw community centres as playing a major part in her concept of community development and democracy seen through individuals organizing themselves into neighbourhood groups, and attending to people's needs, desires and aspirations. This can also include parks.
In the United Kingdom, the oldest community centre is possibly that which was established in 1901 in Thringstone, Leicestershire by the old age pensions pioneer, Charles Booth (1847-1916). Extended in 1911 and taken over by the Leicestershire County Council in 1950, this centre still thrives as an educational, social and recreational community resource and was the inspiration for numerous others of its kind.
There are also community centres for a specific purpose, but serving the whole community, such as an arts centre.
Community centres online are defined as a web based interactive, user-submitted network for groups, organizations, or businesses. Users create their own personal profiles, blogs, groups, photos, art, calendars, music and videos to display on their own pages. Administrators provide oversight to the content and approve membership of users.
Urban planning [ edit ]
In Singapore, community centres are distinct buildings that are officially designated by the government of Singapore. They are meant to play an urban planning role especially as part of Housing Development Board projects. Enrichment and grassroots organization are their functions like most other community centres, but relieving traffic congestion concerns by placing community centres nearby is also another reason.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission will be to “think big” and “make quicker decisions,” an executive of the company said on Monday.

One aim of Ford's “Team Edison” is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification.
Global demand for electric vehicles has “a significant potential to increase” as governments implement EV mandates and quotas, Marakby said in an interview.
He said the group will be based in the Detroit area and work with regional Ford vehicle electrification teams in China and Europe.
China, India, France and the United Kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.
Marakby said Team Edison “will look holistically at the electric vehicle market.”
“The idea is to think big, move fast and make quicker decisions” on EV production as demand increases and technology advances, he added.
Ford has not altered its previously announced plan to spend $4.5 billion over five years on electrified vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, Marakby said.
He declined to say how many new electric vehicles Ford expects to add in the future.
The new team will report to Ted Cannis, who has been named global director of electrification.
For years, environmentalists and the gas drilling industry have been in a pitched battle over the possible health implications of hydro fracking. But to a great extent, the debate — as well as the emerging lawsuits and the various proposed regulations in numerous states — has been hampered by a shortage of science.
In 2011, when ProPublica first reported on the different health problems afflicting people living near gas drilling operations, only a handful of health studies had been published. Three years later, the science is far from settled, but there is a growing body of research to consider.
Below, ProPublica offers a survey of some of that work. The studies included are by no means a comprehensive review of the scientific literature. There are several others that characterize the chemicals in fracking fluids, air emissions and waste discharges. Some present results of community level surveys.
Yet, a long-term systematic study of the adverse effects of gas drilling on communities has yet to be undertaken. Researchers have pointed to the scarcity of funding available for large-scale studies as a major obstacle in tackling the issue.
A review of health-related studies published last month inEnvironmental Science & Technology concluded that the current scientific literature puts forward “both substantial concerns and major uncertainties to address.”
Still, for some, waiting for additional science to clarify those uncertainties before adopting more serious safeguards is misguided and dangerous. As a result, a number of researchers and local activists have been pushing for more aggressive oversight immediately.
The industry, by and large, has regarded the studies done to date — a number of which claim to have found higher rates of illness among residents living close to drilling wells — as largely anecdotal and less than convincing.
“The public health sector has been absent from this debate,” said Nadia Steinzor, a researcher on the Oil and Gas Accountability Project at the environmental nonprofit, Earthworks.
Departments of health have only become involved in states such as New York and Maryland where regulators responded to the public's insistence on public health and environmental reviews before signing off on fracking operations. The states currently have a moratorium on fracking.
New York State Health Commissioner Nirav Shah is in fact conducting a review of health studies to present to Governor Andrew Cuomo before he makes a decision on whether to allow fracking in the state. It is unclear when the results of the review will be publicly available.
Other states such as Pennsylvania and Texas, however, have been much more supportive of the gas industry. For instance, Texas has been granting permits for fracking in ever increasing numbers while at the same time the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the agency that monitors air quality, has had its budget cut substantially.
1. An Exploratory Study of Air Quality near Natural Gas Operations. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment, 2012.
The study, performed in Garfield County, Colo., between July 2010 and October 2011, was done by researchers at The Endocrine Disruption Exchange, a non-profit organization that examines the impact of low-level exposure to chemicals on the environment and human health.
In the study, researchers set up a sampling station close to a well and collected air samples every week for 11 months, from when the gas wells were drilled to after it began production. The samples produced evidence of 57 different chemicals, 45 of which they believe have some potential for affecting human health.
In almost 75 percent of all samples collected, researchers discovered methylene chloride, a toxic solvent that the industry had not previously disclosed as present in drilling operations. The researchers noted that the greatest number of chemicals were detected during the initial drilling phase.
While this study did catalogue the different chemicals found in air emissions from gas drilling operations, it did not address exposure levels and their potential effects. The levels found did not exceed current safety standards, but there has been much debate about whether the current standards adequately address potential health threats to women, children and the elderly.
The researchers admitted their work was compromised by their lack of full access to the drilling site. The air samples were collected from a station close to what is known as the well pad, but not the pad itself.
The gas drilling industry has sought to limit the disclosure of information about its operations to researchers. They have refused to publicly disclose the chemicals that are used in fracking, won gag orders in legal cases and restricted the ability of scientists to get close to their work sites. In a highly publicized case last year, a lifelong gag order was imposed on two children who were parties to a legal case that accused one gas company of unsafe fracking operations that caused them to fall sick.
In 2009, the Independent Petroleum Association of America started Energy In Depth, a blog that confronts activists who are fighting to ban fracking and challenges research that in any way depicts fracking as unsafe.
Energy In Depth responded to this Garfield County study and criticized its lack of proper methodology. The blog post also questioned the objectivity of the researchers, asserting that their “minds were already made up.”
The industry has also been performing its own array of studies.
Last year, for instance, an industry-funded study on the methane emissions from fracking wells was published in the prestigious journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It concluded that only very modest amounts of methane — a known contributor to climate change — was being emitted into the air during fracking operations.
The study came under heavy criticism from Cornell researcher Robert Howarth, who two years prior had published work that claimed methane emissions from shale gas operations were far more significant.
“This study is based only on evaluation of sites and times chosen by industry,” he said.
2. Birth Outcomes and Natural Gas Development. Environmental Health Perspectives, 2014.
The study examined babies born from 1996 to 2009 in rural Colorado locations — the state has been a center of fracking for more than a decade. It was done by the Colorado School of Public Health and Brown University.
The study asserted that women who lived close to gas wells were more likely to have children born with a variety of defects, from oral clefts to heart issues. For instance, it claimed that babies born to mothers who lived in areas dense with gas wells were 30 percent more likely to have congenital heart defects.
The researchers, however, were unable to include data on maternal health, prenatal care, genetics and a host of other factors that have been shown to increase the risk of birth defects because that information was not publicly available. A common criticism of many scientific studies is that they do not fully analyze the possibility of other contributing factors.
The study has thus come under attack from both the industry and state public health officials. In a statement, Dr. Larry Wolk, the state's Chief Medical Officer, said “people should not rush to judgment” as “many factors known to contribute to birth defects were ignored” in the study.
But Lisa McKenzie, one of the lead authors of the study, said there was value to the work.
“What I think this is telling us is that we need to do more research to tease out what is happening and to see if these early studies hold up when we do more rigorous research,” she said.
In Pennsylvania, Elaine Hill, a graduate student at Cornell University, obtained data on gas wells and births between 2003 and 2010. She then compared birth weights of babies born in areas of Pennsylvania where a well had been permitted but never drilled and areas where wells had been drilled. Hill found that the babies born to mothers within 2.5 kilometers (a little over 1.5 miles) of drilled gas sites were 25 percent more likely to have low birth weight compared to those in non-drilled areas. Babies are considered as having low birth weight if they are under 2500 grams (5.5 pounds).
Hill's work is currently under review by a formal scientific journal, a process that could take three or four years.
3. Health Risks and Unconventional Natural Gas Resources. Science of the Total Environment, 2012.
Between January 2008 and November 2010, researchers at the Colorado School of Public Health collected air samples in Garfield County, Colo., which has been experiencing intensive drilling operations. Researchers found the presence of a number of hydrocarbons including benzene, trimethylbenzene and xylene, all of which have been shown to pose health dangers at certain levels.
Researchers maintained that those who lived less than half a mile from a gas well had a higher risk of health issues. The study also found a small increase in cancer risk and alleged that exposure to benzene was a major contributor to the risk.
“From the data we had, it looked like the well completion phase was the strongest contributor to these emissions,” said Lisa McKenzie, the lead author of the study.
During the completion phase of drilling, a mixture of water, sand and chemicals is forced down the well at high pressure, and is then brought back up. The returning mixture, which contains radioactive materials and some of the natural gas from the geological formation, is supposed to be captured. But at times the mixture comes back up at pressures higher than the system can handle and the excess gas is directly vented into the air.
“I think we ought to be focused on the whole thing from soup to nuts because a lot of the potential hazards aren't around the hydraulic fracturing step itself,” said John Adgate, chair of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Colorado School of Public Health and co-author on the study.
Energy In Depth, the industry blog, responded at length to this study and cited several “bad inputs” which had affected the results of the study. The researchers' assumptions and data were criticized. For instance, the researchers had assumed that Garfield residents would remain in the county until the age of 70 in order to estimate the time period over which they would be exposed to the emissions.
“Unless the ‘town' is actually a prison, this is a fundamentally flawed assumption about the length and extent of exposure,” Energy In Depth said.

In 1914, Russian physicist Boris Weinberg proposed an electromagnetic vacuum train that could move an individual passenger from New York to San Francisco in half a day. Reasoning that air resistance and friction are the greatest enemies to speed, Weinberg envisioned using electromagnets to suspend a car in a tube from which the air had been partially exhausted. An individual passenger would lie prone in a 300-pound iron cylinder drawn along by a series of solenoids. New passengers could be introduced into the system through an airlock at a rate as high as 12 per minute, “the whole proceeding being not unlike that of feeding cartridges from a belt or clip to a machine gun.”
Weinberg estimated a maximum speed of 500 mph. “Think what that means!” he wrote in The Popular Science Monthly. “New York would be no more distant from Chicago than it is now from Philadelphia, so far as relative times are concerned. Florida might easily become a kind of winter Coney Island for all New York.”
He built a model of the system at the Technological Institute of Tomsk, but the project never got off the ground (so to speak). One reason may have been the cost: In order to slow the cars gradually, each station would have to be 2 miles long.
Story highlights Father of Internet activist says "MIT in fact played a central role in Aaron's suicide"
Internal report finds no wrongdoing by MIT in the case of Aaron Swartz
Swartz committed suicide while facing charges he stole documents from MIT's computers
MIT president: "I am confident MIT's decisions were reasonable ... and made in good faith"
An internal report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has found that it committed no wrongdoing in the case of Internet activist Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide while facing charges he hacked into the university's computers and stole millions of online documents.
But the report also questioned MIT's "neutral" policy on the issues raised by Swartz's prosecution and suggested the university could have showed more leadership. It also asked whether MIT should become involved in debates over reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act -- one of the laws under which Swartz was charged.
Swartz, 26, was discovered dead in his Brooklyn, New York, apartment in January. He was facing 13 felony counts stemming from his illegal downloading from MIT of more than 4 million articles from JSTOR, a repository of research journals, and was scheduled to go to trial in April. If convicted on the federal computer-fraud charges, he faced up to 35 years in prison.
Swartz was an Internet savant who helped develop social-news site Reddit and RSS, the technology that allows websites to send updates to subscribers. He was an outspoken advocate for the free exchange of information over the Internet and co-founded Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against Internet censorship.

After his suicide, Swartz's family issued a statement criticizing prosecutors for seeking "an exceptionally harsh array of charges (for) an alleged crime that had no victims," and claiming that decisions made by prosecutors and MIT officials had "contributed to his death."
The MIT report on Swartz was issued by a review panel led by Hal Abelson, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science. In preparing its report, the panel reviewed about 10,000 pages of documents and interviewed about 50 people, including MIT faculty, students, alumni and staff; lawyers, police officers and prosecutors; and Swartz's friends and family.
"The review panel's careful account provides something we have not had until now: an independent description of the actual events at MIT and of MIT's decisions in the context of what MIT knew as the events unfolded," Reif wrote in his accompanying letter. "From studying this review of MIT's role, I am confident that MIT's decisions were reasonable, appropriate and made in good faith."
But others disagreed, including Swartz's family and romantic partner.
"Having now read Abelson's report, it is clear that MIT in fact played a central role in Aaron's suicide," Robert Swartz, Aaron's father, said in an e-mailed statement through a family friend.
"MIT made numerous mistakes that warrant further examination and significant changes. MIT was not neutral in the legal case against Aaron. And whether MIT was neutral or not is a red herring: the university had a moral obligation to advocate on Aaron's behalf."
Robert Swartz had some conciliatory reaction as well.
"We are encouraged by MIT President Raphael Reif's desire to ensure that some positive comes of the terrible, tragic situation in which Aaron found himself, and applaud MIT for its commitment to self-examination."
Swartz's partner was upset at the report.
"MIT's behavior throughout the case was reprehensible, and this report is quite frankly a whitewash," said Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman.
"We have an institution to contrast MIT with -- JSTOR, who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution. Aaron would be alive today if MIT had acted as JSTOR did. MIT had a moral imperative to do so," she said.
There was further reaction, too.
"Today's report was intended to provide closure for the MIT community regarding the overprosecution and tragic loss of Aaron Swartz. Instead, the report simply whitewashes MIT's role in Aaron's prosecution and revises history to protect MIT's image," said Demand Progress campaigner Charlie Furman.
"MIT does not seem to understand that a few simple, reasonable actions would have saved Aaron's life," Furman added. "If the university had said publicly, 'we don't want this prosecution to go forward,' there would have been no case, and Aaron would be alive today."
It's here! The Loremaster's Guide for Adventures in Middle-Earth has been released by Cubicle 7. Given my interest in the game line, I quickly snapped this one up pretty quickly. I haven't even leafed through the pdf yet… care to join me?
I used to write this sort of review all the time, a first-in approach that I called a One-Hour Review, when I wrote for another site. I'm not going to do that here, though, because I want to take my time on this one and go through this book methodically.
Specifically, I'm looking for a few different things in this. First of all, does this book offer something more for creating the world of Tolkien's Middle-Earth that I don't already have from The One Ring sourcebooks? Secondly, does this book offer me new character options that are interesting but also in line with the Fifth Edition Player's Handbook and, more pressingly, the Dungeon Master's Guide? Lastly, does this book offer me a good spread of creatures to use in a Middle-Earth campaign, something I really missed from the first book?
Let's see!
Setting Material
Well, right off the bat the cover is absolutely gorgeous. I'd seen pictures but seeing a full-scale version is just… wow. Inside, the book starts right off with an overview of Wilderland and it seems to follow the same set-up as The One Ring, which is great since that's an awesome way to frame the campaign. In fact, this material is all directly cribbed from The Loremaster's Book for The One Ring. I don't really blame them for reusing the material and it was pretty awesome the first time around!
Something different from The One Ring is that the discussion of each area (split up into the Lands About the Mountain, Lake-town, the Land of the Beornings, the Land of the Woodmen, Mirkwood, and Other Lands) include adventure seeds for each one. The section on Dale, for instance, has an idea for sending heroes out to find a farmstead for a veteran to give to his daughter and Erebor has an awesome idea of finding the jerk who's been killing the Dwarves' ravens. My favorite, though, involves masquerading as Radagast while he takes care of business elsewhere. Whatever your gaming style, plenty to start your characters on.
There's stuff on Lake-town too which you won't find in the Loremaster's Book, but you will find in the Lake-town supplement that came with the GM Screen for The One Ring.
There are also some new paragraphs on Eriador to the west and Gondor and Rohan to the south. Necessary when those cultures are in the game from the start… In all, though, there's not much new material here that I didn't already have. Also, the Tale of Years covers all the events up to 2951 just like in the Loremaster's Book, which means you're right up to when things get really bad and still nearly 70 years before the start of the War of the Ring.
Character Options
To get things started, there is a great section of advice called Before the Game which is a lot like the Master of Worlds section from the Dungeon Master's Guide. It contains advice on GMing in a world where absolute good and absolute evil are definite and real things, on playing out a campaign with the backdrop of a slow, inexorable darkening, and making your players feel every mile walked and every year survived.
The second section of the Adventuring Phase chapter deals with melding the core D&D 5e rules with Adventures in Middle-Earth. As the book says, there are two “guiding lights” to help the Loremaster: the core rules and the spirit of the books you are emulating. To that end, the Loremaster's Guide offers a few changes to what you find in the Player's Handbook.
The most immediately helpful is the advice on Inspiration. I've been wanting to use this more in my game but, given the vague rules of Inspiration and the different nature of Middle-earth, it hasn't been easy. The Loremaster's Guide presents Inspiration as the counterpoint to Shadow points, which makes sense. It suggests using Inspiration points when you see some of the amazing sights of Middle-earth, meet some of the more legendary figures of the land, and even at the start of an Adventuring Phase to represent the buoying power of Fellowship (something that characters in The One Ring get, so it makes sense).
There's also a section on multiclassing that opens up a lot of options for players. That part is exceedingly short so I'll make my mention of it the same.
The next chapter is on Journeys and has some interesting suggestions on how to adapt the rules. First of all, you're not supposed to let your players use long rests during a journey, which I see the wisdom of. Exhaustion is a powerful consequence of failing rolls during a journey but my players regularly keep their exhaustion levels down during the journey since they are always sleeping (the lazy bastards). On the other hand, if they can't remove levels of exhaustion during the journey things could get pretty hairy for the PCs, particularly if there's a fight at the end of the journey.
There's a section to address this, pointing out that dangerous journeys with deadly fights at the end are part of the books and so it's no problem to have them in your game. Still, games that feel like a grind aren't (always) fun so you can give the players a chance for a quick night's sleep before they fight the Goblins (or whatever) and you can provide a chance to use skills to regain some Hit Points (maybe they find some athelas).
In fact, the book suggests some criteria your players have to meet before they can take a long rest: safety, comfort, or an air of tranquility. These things are very unlikely to be met during a journey, explaining the limitation, but you can always throw in a quiet Elven ruin or a feast put on by Tom Bombadil might allow some recovery before the actual event.
There are also suggestions for sights the PCs might see on the road and suggestions for when to tweak the journey rules, when (and where) to interrupt a journey, and guidelines for making new travel tables. This last part seems especially useful to me, particularly since my players have taken a half-dozen journeys at this point and there have been a few repeat results. You can improvise a new take on a journey event that your players have already seen but this is another option.
Towards the end of the book are three chapters that make me want to revamp everything in my game. The first is entitled “Wondrous, Legendary and Healing Items,” although I would call it “Including Magic Items While Still Feeling like Tolkien.” Artifacts (I refuse to write “artefacts,” Cubicle 7) are equivalent to what we used to call “wondrous items:” general-purpose magical items that help with skills or do something special. These items do the same (providing a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus) but the special uses are a little different.
In Adventures in Middle-Earth, artifacts don't do specific things. There's no portable hole or ring of spider climb. Instead, the artifact has a certain character (reflected in what skill it helps) and players can spend points of Inspiration to push that a little. For example, if a cloak provides a bonus to Stealth (say, a gift from the Elves of Lorien) the player might decide that it let's him completely slip right through the ranks of a group of Orcs or hide a companion too.
In addition to the Inspiration, the player spends Hit Dice depending on whether it's a small, medium, or large effect and how many creatures it's affecting. This is a really interesting approach to magic and is a great way to include players in the narrative. Also, don't worry: there's a random table to roll for skills. Plus there's some advice for bringing in other 5e items from other sources (short answer: be careful).
The other category of magical items is legendary weapons and armor, your standard magic weapons. These are not like the magic weapons found in the Dungeon Master's Guide, though, they are much more like the legendary items from D&D 3e which grow in power and ability as their wielders do. The iconic version of this for me is the sword Narsil, shattered by Sauron during the Siege of Barad-dûr, reforged into Andúril in Rivendell, then carried by Aragorn against the final battle with Sauron at the end of the Third Age. Every step of the way the legend grows and, it would seem, the sword's power does the same.
Weapons and armor of legend don't start out with a slew of magical abilities, but rather gain them as you level. The magical abilities (sorry, “enchanted qualities”) of the items are more drama-filled: weapons that strike terror into the enemy, weapons that burn creatures of the Shadow with their touch, armors of mithril or scored with Dwarven runes.
Last is a small section on magical healing including rules for Lembas bread. These all tend to remove a level of exhaustion, though some restore small amounts of Hit Dice. I think this is a good compromise between healing potions and nothing, since it still requires people to rest in order to heal up.
The section on Magic in Middle Earth is short and sweet. There are discussions about why spellcasters aren't really part of the PC make-up, what spells really are in Tolkien's world, and guidelines for making spells work thematically, from fairy-tale enchantments to the Unseen World to powerful names or words. There are also some suggestions for how to include D&D spellcasters in Adventures in Middle-Earth… although that's not really the direction I ever see taking this game. I mean… Just play in Eberron or Faerun, right?
The chapter on the Fellowship Phase adds some much-needed clarification for me. It discusses when players mess up your Fellowship Phase plans (“alright, so you guys are going shopping in Lake-town and you're going to find Gandalf and you're going… into Goblin-town?”) and it adds some specific uses for Sanctuaries. Personally, I've wanted my players to do something with Sanctuaries every Fellowship Phase of the campaign so far and they keep asking “why?” I had no answer… until now. Plus there are some moreideas for patrons (as in the Adventurer's Companion) so there's some extra clarity there too.
Middle-Earth Creatures
The first section of characters for the Loremaster to use is a collection of NPCs with a discussion of the various races of Free People and then some specific stat blocks. There are chieftains, messengers, farmers, Rangers, Elf-lords, and more. These are not just reskinned NPCs from the Monster Manual either (although I recommend that as a DMing tool as well) but new characters with different abilities. The farmer, for instance, can whistle for his dogs to come help in combat and the Dwarf NPCs can reroll their damage against Orcs.
There's also a section on Motivation (a one line sentence for guidance) and Expectations (some mechanical benefits for different tactics) for each NPC listing. This previews the next section on Audiences with some guidelines for planning and running Audiences (as described in the Adventurer's Guide). This section is a lot more detailed and I look forward to using it. The mechanics are all the same from the last book but they are laid out here i a much more intuitive way that is obviously geared towards the Loremaster designing Audiences rather than the players participating in them.
The next chapter is probably what I've been anticipating the most: stats for enemy creatures and monsters. It's also the part of the book that is least like I expected.
There's some solid advice for creating battles that emulate Tolkien's big battles (defensive position, setting that appears to favor the enemy, etc), and some great new terrain for adding color to your battles (bogs, crags, rotten trees, freezing pools) separated by setting. There are even some weather effects which I have been yearning for in my own game.
After that is a Bestiary with many of the things you'd expect: Orcs, Mordor-Orcs, spiders of Mirkwood, Trolls, wolves, Werewolves, and Vampires. This is the same list (more or less) as in The One Ring‘s Loremaster's Book which isn't that surprising. I was kind of hoping for some big hitters, though. I mean, this chapter has a picture of Smaug breathing flames into Erebor… Maybe a mention of how to run dragons? And what about the Ringwraiths? Sure those things weren't in the first collection of monsters for The One Ring, but Cubicle 7 has done them and knows how they'd handle them. Plus there are already so many 5e monsters available, why not use those as a stepping-stone and give us a little something?
I'm not disappointed in the collection of monsters (far from it), I just wish there were a few more. On the other hand, I'm very excited about the remainder of the chapter which is a list of creature abilities and actions for making new adversaries. There are general ones, bonus actions, creature reactions, troupe abilities (like a wolf pack), especially strong abilities, and ones intended for a specific type of creature (like trolls or spiders). This is something that not even the Monster Manual offers: guidelines for making interesting, unique creatures that are more than just CR-appropriate stats. Expect some fresh Middle-earth adversaries in future blog posts using these abilities.
Conclusion
This book had a lot of surprises and some areas where I was hoping for a bit more. Overall, though, it is brimming with help for the Adventures in Middle-Earth Loremaster. If you already play (or at least have access to) the line of The One Ring, don't expect a lot more lore or setting information. You still have much more in the way of detail from mining those books and porting the information over to your AME game.
I have had a lot of questions about how to adequately implement a lot of what's described in the Adventurer's Guide, though, and this book does a really excellent job of answering them. A must-buy if you are running this game.

For the first few minutes I'm not even sure this interview should be taking place at all. The greeting is an awkward shuffle of hunched shoulders and downcast eyes; he can't look at me, and I can't hear him. His gaze averted, hands stuffed into pockets, he mumbles in haltingly reluctant whispers, as if words can cause him physical pain. The man should be talking to a doctor, I worry, not a nosy journalist. We try some small talk, but it's almost impossible to make out what he's saying – until I ask what he prefers to be called. "Adam," he says firmly, glancing up for the first time. "Adam Ant." Does anyone ever call him Stuart? "Me mum," he half grins. And then gradually, inch by inch, he starts to relax.
It is still quite a stretch to believe this can be the same man whose fearless, white-striped face stared down from the bedroom wall of pretty much every teenage girl I knew back in the early 80s. Fifteen hit singles – among them Prince Charming and Stand and Deliver – in just three years, and lavishly baroque videos, made Ant one of the decade's first pop superstars, inspiring Antmania in a generation of hysterical fans and selling more than 16m albums, before the singer quit in 1986, to become an actor in the United States.
Over the years since then he has acted in some respectable if unmemorable TV shows and movies, made a couple of moderately successful albums, and toured small venues across Europe and the US. He married briefly, had a daughter, divorced and moved back to London. But he has also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, hospitalised repeatedly, medicated, sectioned and convicted of affray. He last made the national headlines in 2003, when he was found by police, tearful and half naked, curled up in the basement of his local cafe, having just attacked his neighbour's flat.
But next month the singer will take to the stage again, performing live at the Proud Gallery in Camden, London, to launch a photographic retrospective of his career. As with many 80s pop icons, it is easy to recall his flamboyant camp as faintly comical, but the exhibition is a startling reminder of his commitment to an aesthetic that was fanatically detailed, highly imaginative and heavily influenced by the sensibility of punk. Ant's relationship with his younger self bears no trace of ironic nostalgia, and he still gets annoyed when anyone muddles him up with the early 80s new romantic scene.
"Cos new romantic was nothing to do with Adam and the Ants. The Ants were a punk band, or a post-punk band if anything, and so historically it's inaccurate. New romantic was basically, in my mind, clubbers with too much makeup on with stupid clothes. I never set foot in any of their clubs, so I find it quite distressing to be nobbled into new romantic, cos it was just a load of guys who looked like they'd had a row with their girlfriends' makeup. There was nothing tough about it, nothing dangerous about it, it was soft electro stuff and it just looked a bit wet. And I didn't like being associated with it."
A man of 58 who still cares this much should probably come across as faintly ridiculous, but the intense seriousness with which Ant deconstructs these arcane distinctions conveys an impression of almost heartbreaking vulnerability. He is also, though, surprisingly pragmatic about the choice between art and commercial success. The first Adam and the Ants album, released in 1979, was too "self-indulgent" to sell well, and he admits: "I wanted money. I just wanted to be – well, I'm quite a competitive person, I want to win. When you work as hard as you can and as much as you can to make your first album, and you don't make any money, then you change things."

So Ant hired Malcolm McLaren to manage the band, but it didn't quite go to plan, because McLaren promptly poached most of its members and formed a new group called Bow Wow Wow. "I was none too pleased. But I also realised that Malcolm was pretty much telling the truth. He said: 'What do you want? Do you want to make records that everybody hears – be as popular as cornflakes – or do you want to be a cult artist?' I said: 'I definitely want to make hit records.' And he said: 'You're going the wrong way about it.'"
Ant found new band members, made a second album in 1980, and struck gold. "I played over 100 clubs before I played Top of the Pops, and in three minutes on Top of the Pops my entire life changed." Given his formative attachment to punk – he can still recall the moment he first saw the Sex Pistols perform live in 1975, and thought, "Now I know what I want to do" – did he feel at all squeamish about appearing on the BBC show? "Well, I'd watched Roxy [Music] on it, and [Marc] Bolan, and the Stones, so I thought if it's good enough for them, why shouldn't it be good enough for you?"
He became a star overnight – and it was everything he had dreamed of. "I loved being in a band," he says simply. "But I was working hard, and I didn't drink, smoke or take drugs at all – I'd set myself almost a Spartan social life." He even drew up a contract prohibiting his band mates from taking drugs. Would he say he was quite controlling? "Well, it was my band. And I wouldn't put up with drugs. And that's what finished it; drugs began to creep in, and I wasn't having it."
Before long he had sacked most of the band, made a successful solo album, and continued to work flat out. His prodigious capacity for work was equalled only by Olympian promiscuity; he has always said his only form of recreation was sex, and when I ask how many women he thinks he slept with, the speed of his reply – "No idea" – suggests a man who has a pretty good idea, but is never going to say. "I just think it sounds like bragging. It would be naive of me to deny there were a lot of girls involved, but for me to give it a number – that's disrespectful."
Was he happy? "I was intensely busy. The touring was crazy, it was a lot of work. But I enjoyed it." Did he have everything he wanted? "I wanted to make good records. But my problem is I've got a low boredom threshold, so I wanted it to look and sound different with each album, which is really tantamount to suicide, cos people lose it, they lose it – they say: 'I like that, and that's not this.' Like with AC/DC or Led Zeppelin, they just stick with that. It's pretty much the same thing. But I didn't want to."
An embarrassingly flat Live Aid performance in 1985 confirmed his departure from the Top 10 for good, but his other problem was to prove much more serious. "The trouble was, I forgot to take any time off. At the end of the day it catches up with you. And it caught up with me in a big way."
Born Stuart Goddard in 1954, into impoverished post-war inner London, he was the only child of a violently unhappy working-class couple who divorced when he was seven. But by then he had already begun suffering from hallucinations. "Yeah, nighthorses – horrible. It was just like a very hallucinogenic kind of feeling; I was awake but it was terrifying. Obviously you don't need a shrink to work out what caused that kind of stuff. If your parents are very unhappy" – and suddenly his voice changes, no longer sanguine and philosophical, but angry and hard – "and beating the fuck out of each other every night, well, you know that's going to happen." The tone of quiet resignation is back as he adds, almost to himself: "Yeah, it was a bad do."
After school he enrolled at art college in north London, married a girl on his course and moved in with her parents. Still only 21, it wasn't long before he began to feel suffocated, trapped in a life that was never going to work – and so he swallowed the contents of his mother-in-law's medicine cabinet. "I think it wasn't a serious attempt to kill myself, but it was serious enough for me to draw attention to the fact that I was very unhappy in that situation, and I wasn't telling people how unhappy I was in that situation."
Discharged from hospital, he changed his name to Adam Ant, formed the band, and success soon spelt the end of his marriage. The long list of subsequent girlfriends included Amanda Donohoe, Jamie Lee Curtis, Heather Graham and Carole Caplin, but it was a woman he had never even met who triggered his second breakdown. Besieged by a mentally unstable stalker in the US, who poisoned his fish-pond, tried to kill his dog and would stand naked outside his house shouting obscenities and threatening to castrate him, in 1994 Ant checked himself into a psychiatric hospital, in a state of hypomania, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

He remarried in 1997, to a PR for Vivienne Westwood, and a year later their daughter was born. "I became a man. Before that I was a little boy. My daughter's the greatest thing that's happened to me in my life and she turned me into a more responsible man, as opposed to just someone who's a perpetual teenager, thinking you're a man when you're not. I took five years off to be with her, and I enjoyed being her dad, and I had enough money to do it, so I was able to not work for five years and look after my daughter."
But by 2002 the marriage was over, the money had run out, and the pressure was reaching danger level again. He had been hospitalised the previous year but had stopped taking his antidepressants, and after decades of abstinence had begun drinking again. Following an argument with a local man, Ant marched into a Camden pub intending to confront him, but was laughed at; he stormed out, returned with a second world war pistol, hurled a car alternator through the pub window, threatened to shoot, and then fled, before being arrested by armed police, bailed and promptly sectioned in a secure psychiatric ward.
He recalls the drama now with a mixture of remorse and righteous indignation. "This was someone that had this delusion that I was doing something with his wife, and I wasn't. So it all got crazy. I basically took the law into my own hands, which was the biggest mistake of my life, I'd never broken the law before, I'd never even had a driving ticket. So you do the wrong thing. Like I say, it was the biggest mistake of my life."
At the Old Bailey he pleaded not guilty on grounds of insanity, but later admitted a lesser charge of affray, and escaped a custodial sentence. But the following year he attacked his neighbour's flat, was sectioned again, and spent six months in a psychiatric hospital.
"I was in a very bad state of mind. But you don't walk into a doctor's surgery and say I'm nuts – and if you do, they just fill you with antidepressants which just turn you into a Tellytubby. Antidepressants are very good, but it's a clinical cosh, really. Sometimes you have to be knocked out, just to stop; when you're in that state all you want to do is just sleep, and rest your body and your brain. But being on antidepressants, if you're not careful you can just be sitting on the couch looking at daytime TV, eating and doing nothing at all." Which is pretty much what he did for the next four years. "And I didn't enjoy it."
Ant talks quite openly about his mental illness, but seems unresolved about medication; he knows he's not well, but the drugs that stabilise his mind also anaesthetise his creativity, and if that is the price he must pay for sanity, he's not sure if it is worth it. When I ask if he is taking medication at the moment, he pauses before answering. "No. But I can if I want to, if I have the warning signs, and I know the warning signs, I can go and get them."
What would be a familiar warning sign? "Well, the trouble is, when you look at the list: sexual promiscuity, spending loads of money, flamboyant behaviour – well, that describes every rock'n'roll star I can think of. That comes with my profession. So it's very difficult to know."
I hadn't expected Ant to still think of himself as a rock'n'roll star. Forged more than 30 years ago, in the heat of Top of the Pops camera lights, this self-image should by now be preposterous – and yet, in his case it seems somehow heroic. He lives alone with his two dogs, close to his daughter, runs his own record label, and talks about his young acts with tenderly paternal protectiveness. One of them is Georgina Baillie, of Sachsgate infamy; "I think it was pretty cowardly, what went on there," he offers with gallant disdain. "Quite shocking, really."
There is an innocence – an almost monastic purity – about Ant's enduring devotion to pop; after coming off antidepressants a few years ago, he began performing live again, playing modest venues, often unannounced, and later this year he will release a new album. I find myself hoping his audiences are respectful, and kind.
Though still beautiful, he has to wear hats and bandanas to disguise the fact that he is now bald. He was always very conscious of his own beauty – "I think to be a pop star you need sex, subversion, style and humour" – and the hair loss seems gratuitously cruel. "Yeah," he admits with quiet sadness. "It was pretty awful.
"But – I dunno – you've just got to do what you can. It's part of the job, really. Just gotta get up, have a shave, and get on with it, really."
Adam Ant will be performing at Proud Camden in London NW1 on Tuesday 6 March to launch an exhibition of portraits, Adam Ant: Dandy in the Underworld, at the gallery from 7 March - 29 April. All proceeds from the event will go to DebRA, a charity working on behalf of individuals and families affected by Epidermolysis. For tickets and further info: visit www.proudcamden.com

As part of my research on the security of paravirtualized devices, I reported a number of vulnerabilities to the Xen security team, which were patched today. All of them are double fetch vulnerabilities affecting the different backend components used for paravirtualized devices. While the severity and impact of these bugs varies heavily and is dependent on a lot of external factors, I would recommend patching them as soon as possible. In the rest of this blog post I'll give a short teaser about my research with full details coming out in the first quarter of 2016 .
In order to understand the technical details of these bugs, some background information about the paravirtualized device architecture in Xen is needed: Paravirtualized guests and HVM guests that do not want to rely on slow emulated devices can use paravirtualized devices to interact with their virtual hardware. These devices are implemented using a split driver architecture: A frontend driver is running in the guest itself, whereas the backend component (by default) runs inside the management domain. Due to the privileged position of the management domain, this means that vulnerabilities in the backend driver can be used to break out of a virtual machine and compromise the whole system. Frontend and backend communicate using a ring buffer implemented on top of shared memory.
In comparison to more high level IPC mechanisms such as sockets, shared memory communication can achieve much higher performance due to the lower amount of copying and context switches required. In particular, after the shared mapping between domains is created, the hypervisor does not need access to any of the exchange data.
But this performance benefit comes with a cost: From a security view point, shared memory interfaces are much harder to secure than a message based interface. The main reason for this is a bug class called double fetch, a term coined by Fermin J. Serna in a post on the Microsoft Security and Defense blog. Double fetches are a special type of TOCTTOU bug that affects shared memory interfaces: When a single value is fetched multiple times from a shared memory page, but validation is only performed once, a race condition is created. A malicious attacker who is able to tamper with the fetched data between these fetches can therefore potentially bypass security checks. Until now, most published examples of double fetch vulnerabilities affect communication between user space and kernel and were discovered as part of the Bochspwn project by Mateusz “j00ru” Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind.
My research builds up on the ideas presented in Bochspwn and uses hypervisor-based memory access tracing to identify double fetch issues in the communication between frontend and backend components. I hope to present a full description of my approach and its results at some conferences in the next year, but for now I'll just talk about one of the more interesting bugs that were patched today, even if the real world impact is probably quite low:
xen-pciback is the backend component used for paravirtualized PCI devices. While this means that the following vulnerability only affects systems where guest have access to a passthrough PCI device, the rising prevalence of GPU instances in the cloud makes this assumption not completely unrealistic. xen-pciback is implemented as a kernel module and executes in the management domain by default. The following code is responsible for handling the different types of message types that can be sent by the backend:
switch (op -> cmd) { case XEN_PCI_OP_conf_read: op -> err = xen_pcibk_config_read(dev, op -> offset, op -> size, & op -> value); break ; case XEN_PCI_OP_conf_write: //... case XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi: //... case XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi: //... case XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix: //... case XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msix: //... default: op -> err = XEN_PCI_ERR_not_implemented; break ; }
Even knowing that the op variable is stored in shared memory, source code analysis alone does not show any double fetches issues. But this quickly changes when looking at the assembly code generated by gcc for this code snippet:
1 2 3 4 5 cmp DWORD PTR [ r13 + 0x4 ], 0x5 mov DWORD PTR [ rbp - 0x4c ], eax ja 0x3358 < xen_pcibk_do_op + 952 > mov eax , DWORD PTR [ r13 + 0x4 ] jmp QWORD PTR [ rax * 8 + off_77D0 ]
As its often the case with switch statements, the compiler generated a jump table to dynamically jump to the correct branch. The r13 register points to the shared memory region and r13+0x4 corresponds to the op->cmd value used in the switch statement. In the first two lines the value at r13+0x4 is compared to the upper limit 5 and the default branch is used if it is higher than that. In line 4, r13+0x4 is fetched a second time and used as index into the jump table.
This means that an attacker who is able to manipulate the data stored at address r13+0x4 in the time between the two fetches, can influence the destination of the final jmp instruction and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution. Even though the race window is very narrow (only two instructions) on multi core systems it can be won in less than 2 minutes.
In summary, a simple switch statement operating on shared memory is compiled into a vulnerable double fetch that allows potentially arbitrary code execution on the Xen management domain — talk about well hidden bugs 🙂

Senegal will hold presidential elections on February 26, pitting incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade against an emboldened but divided opposition. The elections could be quite bitterly contested. On Friday, Wade officially accepted the nomination of his party, but both inside and outside the country, his candidacy is provoking condemnation. Critics argue that the president, who is nearing the end of his second term, should not run again; Wade argues that because two-term limits for the presidency were introduced only after his first term began, he is eligible for one more term. I do not anticipate that any legal obstacle – including a ruling by the country's courts – will prevent Wade from running, but the level of domestic and international outcry is significant. Senegal is not headed for chaos, in my view, but the country's stability could be shaken in the months to come.
AFP (see link above) gives us a glimpse of how the domestic opposition to Wade is unfolding. Protests against his rule have been going on since last winter, feeding into broader discontent concerning economic stagnation in the country.
Thousands of opponents headed to a square in Dakar on Friday after Wade's candidacy was announced. Demonstrators held signs bearing slogans such as: “Against Violation of the Constitution,” “Wade Go Away” and “Rise Up Against the High Cost of Living!” The rally was organised by the June 23 Movement (M23), a coalition of activists and political groups named after summer riots protesting proposed election law changes.
AFP also reports clashes between Wade's supporters and opponents in Dakar last week. Violence has not been a major part of the political landscape in Senegal in 2011, so it is concerning to hear this.
Turning to international criticism of Wade, VOA reports that four members of the US Congress have sent Wade a letter urging him not to run.
In a letter obtained by VOA's French to Africa Service, the two senators and two representatives take note of street clashes in Senegal's capital earlier this year, and tell Wade that the country could experience more unrest if he runs for re-election. They warn a constitutional crisis could undo advances for democracy in Senegal, and strain the country's ties with the US. The authors of the letter include Christopher Coons, chairman of the US Senate Subcommittee on Africa.
It has been hard for me to gauge the level of “Wade fatigue” among Western powers like France and the US, but this letter is another hint that Paris and Washington are concerned about the protests and may prefer Wade's departure over whatever stability his continued rule might offer. Rumors were already circulating several months ago that the French have opened discussions with Idrissa Seck, a former protege of Wade's who is now one of the president's main rivals.
The next two months and beyond could be fairly tense in Senegal, especially if more violence occurs. As VOA writes, “presidential politics in Senegal is in full swing now.”

The CEO of Newsmax Media, known for having a relationship with President Trump, wrote on Sunday that Trump insists he will be proven right regarding his allegation of wiretaps at Trump Tower.
“I spoke with the President twice yesterday about the wiretap story. I haven't seen him this pissed off in a long time,” Christopher Ruddy wrote in an article for his website.
“When I mentioned Obama ‘denials' about the wiretaps, he shot back: ‘This will be investigated, it will all come out. I will be proven right,'” he said.
Trump on Saturday accused former President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWith low birth rate, America needs future migrants 4 ways Hillary looms over the 2020 race Obama goes viral after sporting black bomber jacket with '44' on sleeve at basketball game MORE of wiretapping Trump Tower before the November election.
Obama, through a spokesman, denied that he or any White House official ordered such surveillance.
"A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice," Kevin Lewis said in a statement.
"As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen," Lewis added. "Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."
White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Sunday called on Congress to incorporate an investigation into the alleged surveillance into its probe on Russia's interference in the presidential election.
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said it will investigate any potential surveillance of political parties as part of the investigation into Russia's cyber activities.
State Of Maryland Increases Renewable Standard Target To 25% By 2020
March 27th, 2017 by Joshua S Hill
The US state of Maryland has increased its renewable energy portfolio standard from a target of 20% by 2022 to an impressive 25% by 2020.
The move was actually made back at the beginning of February by legislators in both houses of the state's General Assembly, at the same time as they moved to override the governor's veto of a bill which sought to increase the use of renewable energy in the state. As can be seen in the graph below, Maryland's percent of retail electricity sales has been climbing, steadily, and the new target allows for that growth to continue.
According to the Maryland Public Service Commission, the state's renewable portfolio standard (RPS) was established back in 2004 in an effort to “capture the economic, environmental, fuel diversity, and security benefits of renewable energy; establish a market for renewable energy in Maryland; and lower the cost of obtaining electricity generated from renewable sources.” Simply put, the RPS steadily increases the amount of renewable energy electricity suppliers must procure from renewable energy sources.
While Maryland is currently sourcing renewable electricity from multiple sources, it has two “set-asides” — technology-specific targets — that must be met. The first is for solar, and requires at least 2.5% sourced by 2020. Offshore wind is the second, and though the target hasn't been set just yet, a 2.5% maximum will begin in 2017.
The US Energy Information Administration says that, in 2015, Maryland's RPS target was 10.5% of electricity sales, which equaled 8 million renewable energy credits (RECs) — tradeable certificates which represent generation of one megawatt-hour from eligible renewable electricity sources. Between 2008 and 2015, the state's renewable generation requirements grew from 2.7 million RECs to 8 million.
Here on land, the seasteaders propose, ideas about how to govern societies have stagnated. Politics is too entrenched; societal change comes slowly, if at all. “Our terrestrially trained minds are blind to the terrifying potential for tyranny in the power to claim land—fixed, immobile, where people have no choice but to live,” write the authors. Seasteads would upset this dynamic, since each floating city would be small enough and modular enough that individuals could come and go freely, shopping for governments and social structures. If residents didn't like one utopia, they could simply sail off to a new one.
There's something seductive about this idea. It's the inverse of Francis Fukuyama's proposition, in his 1992 book The End of History and the Last Man, that global liberal democracy was the end point of politics and the world would seethe no more—a notion at once comforting and deflating. The Seasteaders imagine the opposite: an endless flowering of new power structures. At a TEDx talk in 2012, Friedman likened the seasteading movement to the Cambrian Explosion—a moment in evolutionary history when the globs and mollusks of the primordial soup gave way to a diverse array of complex organisms. “Not only humans, but human societies evolve,” Friedman asserted. “We need new places to try new rules.”
The authors don't say which new rules, exactly, they hope to try, and the Seasteading Institute makes clear that it will not be operating the cities itself. The particulars of each seastead's political system should be determined by its inhabitants—or an oligarch, if that's the way it turns out. “Any set of rules is OK,” the organization's FAQ page emphasizes, “as long as the residents consent to it voluntarily and can leave whenever they choose.”
Quirk and Friedman insist that their movement is apolitical: “Seasteading is less an ideology than a technology,” they claim. But the ability to choose among societies at sea is itself political, the expression of a belief that free markets are the ultimate guarantee of happiness. What's more, the pitfalls of the free market seem even more dire when the commodity being produced is governance itself: In a world where citizen-consumers can move between societies as they choose, the poorest and most vulnerable could easily be priced out and left adrift. As with so many consumption choices on the free market, the “choice” is only available to those with means, while those with limited purchasing power are constrained and even coerced.
This might sound silly: Seasteading, of course, would be an option, an add-on to land-based societies, and those who don't want to go could simply stay on the shore. But if seasteading is also a grand thought experiment about decentralizing power and increasing mobility, it has to consider how those dynamics work for everyone. And that, by definition, means the nature of the endeavor is inherently political.
It is not hard to see why this free-market vision appealed to libertarian backers like Thiel. Libertarianism prizes freedom and autonomy, expressing skepticism of taxes, regulations, and any other version of state power that impinges on individual sovereignty. In 2009, with the world reeling from the subprime mortgage crisis that ballooned into a global banking meltdown, Thiel wrote that the crisis had been caused by “too much debt and leverage, facilitated by a government that insured against all sorts of moral hazards.” The response, he warned, would be even more government intervention; believers in the free market were “screaming into a hurricane.” The essay, “The Education of a Libertarian,” is also an elegy, lamenting the lack of “truly free places left in our world.”
Democracy did not strike Thiel as a path to the freedom he seeks. At the Seasteading Institute's conference in 2009, he spoke about his own intellectual development. Where he once saw political argument as a way to solve problems, he now viewed it as a problem in itself. It is not only ineffective at making the world freer, it's also unpleasant: All the fighting over political ideals reminded him of “trench warfare.” As he had put it in his essay, he wished to “escape, not via politics, but beyond it.”
For Thiel, seasteading represented one of the few arenas in which individuals might still act free from any government restriction or regulation. “Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be paramount,” he opined in his essay. “The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.” This is more or less what Quirk and Friedman have in mind with their vision of life at sea. “We don't trust people with power,” they write. “We trust them with freedom.”
In 2011, Thiel funded Blueseed, which was to be a floating tech incubator based in international waters off the coast of Northern California, a short ferry ride from Silicon Valley. The idea was to provide a base of operations for entrepreneurs who wanted to bypass the hassle of U.S. immigration laws—“an immigration hack,” as Atossa Abrahamian put it in a Quartz op-ed. The idea eventually fizzled out when Blueseed was unable to raise enough money to get its business hub for cruise ships off the ground. The company's final missive, in January 2015, was a retweet: “When 99% of people doubt your idea, you're either gravely wrong or about to make history.” It closed, touchingly, with “#inspiration” and “#start-up.”
For all its failures, Blueseed did achieve one thing: It exemplified the impracticalities and contradictions of the seasteading movement's anti-political vision. To dream up a cruise ship business hub that parks just beyond the Golden Gate Bridge and sails under a Bahamanian flag, allowing for easy international movement free of immigration laws, is both truly innovative and deeply political. It's political to value open borders and internationalism, and to strive to create a center for innovation that would benefit from a particular system of governance.
The same can be said of the whole seasteading project. A nation where citizens can come and go freely, detaching their modular floating living quarters and sailing off to a better floating town, untethered by anything but their means and their free will, is not an island without politics—it's an island with a very particular set of politics. I am, for instance, all for a carbon-negative island that floats over the ocean, clearing marine dead zones with its vibrant, submerged kelp forests and aquaculture structures, producing its own food in towering hydroponic gardens and recycling its desalinated seawater—all ideas put forward by Quirk and Friedman. But that's because of my politics.
Technology can do many things, many of them verging on the miraculous—but it cannot bypass values, commitments, interests, and beliefs. Hearing the language and philosophy of tech disruption applied to government—when so many of the amazing technological advances that have fueled recent disruptions have done so at the expense of labor rights and individual privacy—we landlubbers are right to be wary. Government is not simply an albatross around the neck of otherwise free individuals. When it works, it protects the vulnerable and guards the commons—essential tasks at which the free market so often fails. Ocean dwellers will also need those protections. Much as we might like to, we can't escape the political, even by walking into the sea.
Money management software tools have become quite popular among consumers. As more and more are trying to tighten their purse strings and lower their debt now more than ever, these convenient applications help people organize and streamline their strategies and accounts. One of the newest ones to hit the market is Pageonce.
Pageonce is a web and mobile device application that serves as a portal to all of your online accounts. It goes beyond being just another money software or budget software option. The application actually has several categories that even some of the best money management software on the market currently lack.
For example, you have access to your credit cards and bank accounts online in the “Finance” section, but that's just one category. There are also areas dedicated to shopping, utilities, travel, email and even social networking accounts.
Pageonce boasts that it has over 3 million users for its product and the company says it is the largest mobile personal finance service in the U.S. You can use it on Apple iPhones and iPads, Blackberries, Android phones and other devices.
What Pageonce Does
The application provides a new spin on money management software. Instead of just limiting to banks and credit card accounts, Pageonce actually reached into other verticals to provide a fully integrated life management application.
Finance: In addition to your bank and credit cards from institutions like Chase and Discover, Pageonce also allows you to check how your investment accounts are doing through brokerages like TD AMERITRADE and Fidelity.
Email: You can read all your emails in one place, as opposed to going to several different websites if you have multiple accounts with different web service providers.
Shopping: You can also check in on your accounts with various retailers like Costco, Blockbuster, Netflix, Wal-Mart and even eBay.
Utilities: If you have monthly bills like for electricity, cellphone or satellite television, Pageonce allows you to check in on your accounts too.
Social Networking: Want to see what your friends are up to? You can access most of your favorite productivity killers social networking sites with the application as well, like Twitter, Flickr, MySpace, LinkedIn and others.
Travel: One of the best features of Pageonce is the access to your information on travel and hotel accounts. You can check in on flights and hotel bookings all in one place. So if you're planning a trip, you don't have to keep bouncing around between your hotel, rewards and airline pages.
Pageonce Mobile Products
The main mobile application is Pageonce Personal Finance, which allows you to track all your accounts mentioned above. The standard version is free, but there's also a premium version that costs $6.99 and comes with additional support, added security as well as an ads-free experience.
The company also offers other free products like Pageonce Bills, TripTrack and Cell Minute Tracker. These applications are essentially spin-offs of features in the flagship product but with some extra tools added in to be more user-friendly. The names are self-explanatory and as one iTunes reviewer put it, “It does what it says.”
What Pageonce Could Improve
While it's great that you can access all these accounts through one application, you can only look at the information found in your account. The problem is that you can't actually make any actions to the accounts you're looking at without leaving the Pageonce site.
While Pageonce provides links to the appropriate pages you need to get to, it'd be a lot more convenient if you could actually access the full functions of your account through the application instead of being sent to it externally.
How to Use Pageonce to Help You
Most money management software reviews for the application have been positive. Pageonce could be a pretty effective tool in helping you organize all your financial and personal accounts. Think of it as your gatekeeper to all of your logins, passwords and financial information.
Does that sound scary? The company says you have nothing to worry about. User-information security is as tight as a drum. The company is certified by TRUSTe, McAfee Secure and VeriSign.
If you feel you have too many accounts to keep track of, or you're constantly forgetting all your hundreds of passwords and usernames, then you might consider giving Pageonce a try. However, as a comprehensive budgeting tool, this app may not be the most helpful option.

A Roswell man faces charges after police say he was driving while high with a child in his car, according to Channel 2 Action News.
Dashcam video obtained by Channel 2 from Alpharetta police shows officers questioning Norman Bercey outside a Mansell Road gas station on March 5.
Phil Head called 911 after seeing Bercey stumbling around the gas station.
“I initially thought he was heading towards Mansell to catch a bus, but then I saw him get into a car,” Head told Channel 2.
When police arrived, they questioned Bercey and conducted a field sobriety test.
“The driver stated that within two hours he had taken Percocet, morphine, other narcotics that put him in the state he was currently in,” George Gordon with the Alpharetta Police Department told Channel 2.
Bercey had his 5-year-old with him in the SUV, which only made charges worse.
“He was charged with DUI, multiple substances and endangering the child while driving in that state,” Gordon told the television station.
Head told Channel 2 he was even more thankful he called after he learned a child was in the car.
“I feel great about it,” Head said. “I felt good about it to begin with and you know the fact that a child's life might have been saved, as a parent, I feel that's the best I could have done.”
Bercey told Channel 2 Monday that he believes police should have never arrested him. He said he took the medication because he is disabled and he doesn't remember ever driving the car.
Bercey also told the station he loves his children and the last thing he'd ever do was put them in danger.
I enjoyed Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln and Killing Kennedy. I favored Lincoln as I believe him to be the better man of the two. Anyone who doesn't have a passion for history doesn't know history, the real history that includes the uncomfortable parts. I was curious about Killing Jesus. Unlike the other two books, a story on Jesus would be mostly hearsay instead of well documented history from reputable sources such as known historians during the time. I was curious as to how honest O'Reilly would be in this endeavor.
There is a reason why these books have been best sellers. Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard don't simply discuss these historical figures, they take you there. The important related events of the time period, the other related characters in the story, the detail of the physical surroundings and the culture are described very well. I hope their next book is Killing Socrates.
My critique of Killing Jesus will include the following sections:
Hearsay vs. History
Bill's Bias
Was Jesus all about Peace and Love?
How do we explain the popularity of Christianity?
The story of Jesus in a nutshell
Conclusion
Hearsay vs. History
The best source for history is what's known as a primary source. Original documentation of people who wrote about the event immediately as it happened is ideal. Newspapers existed during the time of Abraham Lincoln and since he was an important man during much of his life there is an abundance of primary sources including the first hand written recordings of letters (by his own hand), speeches and countless interviews with family and friends.
With Kennedy there is greater information available as the technology of video recording allows young people today to see actual video footage of speeches and interviews of a famous man who died many years before they were born. With Jesus the main sources of information are not in original documentation.
The Biblical writings are copies of copies and translations of a mound of various texts where some portions were edited and entered into what we know as the New Testament long after Jesus died. Even the sources of many of these writings are in question, they may not be written by the people that they are attributed to.
What happens when we don't have primary sources of information? We lose accuracy of data. For example, Julius Caesar was assassinated on March 15th, 44 B.C. We know the year and the day. In regards to Jesus Christ the best estimates are that he was born in the spring of either 6 or 5 B.C. and died around the start of Passover (exact day has inconsistent accounts) around 27-30 A.D. Clearly we have greater historical records of Julius Caesar than Jesus.
Killing Jesus is a mix of history and hearsay. The detail around the actual practice of crucifixion is good history based on solid research. A lot of review was done through ancient but still primary sources to provide detail on this brutal Roman practice of torture and death. Details included the well-organized executioners who had various positions, roles and responsibilities. In contrast, everything in Killing Jesus on the conversations that took place between Jesus and Pontius Pilate are completely hearsay. It's arguable that these conversations were invented by people who weren't there, have no idea what actually transpired and wanted to add their own twist to the story.
For example, this passage from Matthew 27:24-25 has caused historical hatred and persecution of Jews and most likely never happened. The Bible is big on punishing children for the so-called sins of the parents.
“When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man's blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”
All the people (Jews) answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!””
Bill's Bias
Bill O'Reilly is upfront in the beginning of the book in regards to the historical challenges of this work compared to his other endeavors. He fully admits to contradictions in the scripture which was refreshing considering the amount of Christians who deny that there are any contradictions from cover to cover. But O'Reilly does partake in picking and choosing what versions of stories are in Killing Jesus and which ones are not. There is also constant mentioning of the love and peace of Jesus Christ that “changed the world.”
For one example of selective text, the book puts the last words of Jesus Christ as “it is finished” and does not mention Matthew 27:46 “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Why would god who sent himself to sacrifice himself to himself in order to save us from himself, but only if you believe it, cry out to himself to ask himself why has he forsaken himself? It's not surprising that Bill would want to conceal this verse that adds crazy on top of crazy, but that doesn't make it go away.
It would be a little less crazy if god and Jesus were separate deities, but that would mean polytheism and we certainly can't have that.
And in regards to the love and peace of Jesus, the following scripture also fails to make it in Bill's book.
Luke 19:27 (Jesus speaking in parable) “But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.”
Does this meld with “love thy enemy” or “love thy neighbor as you love thyself?”
And as for the constant rhetoric of Jesus changing the world and being the most influential man who ever lived, this statement is made repeatedly without any actual examples. It is obvious that millions of people would call themselves Christian instead of some pagan religion or other name because of the Christian movement that apparently did begin by a man named Jesus who was crucified. But aside from labels, what has really changed?
It is said that Jesus turned over tables of corrupt money changers who were Jewish. Have the money changers who were Christian been any less corrupt? Did the Roman Empire become less oppressive with the adoption of Christianity? Or did religion fuel the egos of dictators giving them not only authority by name but by claiming authority by god? Is not monotheism ideal for the dictator? Fewer priests and gods to deal with in claiming divine authority.
Was Jesus all about Peace and Love?
There are absolutely loving and tolerant passages claimed to be attributed to Jesus. The problem is Jesus never aggressively denounces or condemns the horrendous hatred and brutality of the Old Testament. In fact it is stated that he is there to enforce the laws of the old prophets.
Matthew 5:17 (Jesus speaking) "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.”
Mark 7:9-10 (Jesus Speaking) “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,' and, ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.'”
Does Jesus transform the Bible into a guide of true morality, or does he simply offer a pretty mask to the ugly god of Abraham? Many argue that the New Testament holds even greater cruelty than the old.
“In the Old Testament, they said. God is the judge -- but in the New, Christ is the merciful. As a matter of fact, the New Testament is infinitely worse than the Old. In the Old there is no threat of eternal pain. Jehovah had no eternal prison -- no everlasting fire. His hatred ended at the grave. His revenge was satisfied when his enemy was dead.
In the New Testament, death is not the end, but the beginning of punishment that has no end. In the New Testament the malice of God is infinite and the hunger of his revenge eternal.” – Robert Green Ingersoll
How do we explain the popularity of Christianity?
If Jesus was a historical nobody, how does one account for the popularity? How does one account for the dedication of early Christians who were persecuted and murdered before Rome adopted the Christian faith? When people are willing to face torture and death for what they believe in, that truly is a remarkable kind of loyalty. But it doesn't prove divinity and Christianity certainly does not hold the monopoly of such loyalty. In fact, there are people who chose brutal torture and death rather than convert to Christianity under the Spanish Inquisition.
Bill appears to insinuate that it is the love and peace of Jesus Christ that accounts for the grand 2.2 billion strong following. I can think of seven reasons that would account for the popularity.
1. The words, as cherry picked as they are, or love and tolerance attributed to Jesus attract many followers.
2. The church (when under good leadership) provides social support, traditions, customs, brotherhood and other commonalities that have served to strengthen communities.
3. Any religion that promotes large families has Darwinian advantages in survival.
4. Nomadic religions have Darwinian advantages over local gods that are immobile.
5. The ruling class found the religion useful to subjugate the peasants and therefore promoted it. Turn the other cheek and don't worry about subjugation in this life because there will be pie in the sky when you die is just the philosophy that rulers want for their subjects. Christianity allows the establishment of a priesthood and church that will grant tyrants divine approval. Christianity and political power have walked hand in hand for many centuries.
6. The religion was spread throughout the world by powerful nations. In my own area of the world millions of South Americans and African Americans call themselves Christian. But in examining history, was this due to the words of a book or the blood of a sword?
7. Heaven and Hell. The great promise and the great threat. Love Jesus and you exist forever without fear of death. Don't love Jesus and burn for all eternity. Now that's one hell of a marketing campaign.
The story of Jesus in a nutshell
At birth born of a virgin and recognized as the fulfiller of a prophecy and given lots of gold and other gifts by wondering wise men.
At twelve impresses people because he was well-spoken and has learned much Jewish law.
As an adult declared Son of God by John the Baptist and a dove lands on his shoulder which was perceived to be some kind of sign. At the time before visiting John the Baptist he has no reverence among the people as the fulfiller of a prophecy, born a virgin, or wealthy from all the gold that was given to him by the wise men. He's just known as a working class carpenter. It's exactly as if those stories were told later to make him fit some prophecy rather than events that actually happened during his life.
Jesus flips over some money changer tables at the temple. Later he declares himself Son of God among people who know him and members of his own family. No one believes him, not even his own brothers. Once again, if the virgin and wise men thing happened, why would no one believe him?
Jesus begins a ministry and draws people to him.
Jesus gets crucified.
Conclusion
Killing Jesus is a book far more interested in glorifying Jesus than presenting honest history. It's a book attempting to proselytize more than educate. The surrounding history is done well. When the book isn't covering Jesus, it provides great information and detail on fascinating characters such as Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. When it comes to other characters, nothing is held back. The uncomfortable details are shared. But with Jesus he is protected.
It's hard to recommend a book that's so biased in its portrayal of history. For anyone who decides to read Killing Jesus, my advice is to be aware of what are true accounts of history and what is selective and sugar coated hearsay.

It's hard to deal with vexingly adequate music. In 2008, I ended up somewhere beyond vexed after witnessing an evening of Chris Martin foofing about and dispensing false modesty like it was a donation to the Red Cross. In 2005, Jon Pareles spanked Martin in an article called “The Case Against Coldplay,” in which he called the group “the most insufferable band of the decade.”
But it's unhealthy to hang on to vexations. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Coldplay have sold 15,124,000 albums in America since its début, in 2000. For the sake of comparison, here is the number of albums sold by other acts in roughly the same time frame:
Train—6,565,000
Rihanna—7,312,000
Maroon 5—8,847,000
Radiohead—10,884,000
Beyonce—12,452,000
In the age of the dying musical commodity (which is not the age of music dying), fifteen million is a big number. So, after Coldplay's new album, “Mylo Xyloto,” leaked on Monday, I spent a few days with it. I wanted to pin down why I usually love “Clocks” but generally can't stand more than a few minutes of the band, even though millions of listeners can. Here is my unscientific effort to measure the band's pros and cons:
Chris Martin, Writer. +14
He can write a catchy melody. See “Paradise,” an immensely stupid song with an elegant and confident verse and chorus line, slightly reminiscent of a prime Noel Gallagher moment.
Chris Martin, Singer. +2
Despite the huggable-park-ranger schtick, Martin sings clearly and without much coloring or dynamic bother. When he writes a good line, he delivers it straight, which aids the listener who will be subjected to the song at least once a day for the next six months (unless the listener chooses to work from home).
Chris Martin, Human Being Who Moves. -678
Nobody in popular music is more annoying to watch. What is he doing with his body? Ever? Is he in The Zone? (It's even annoying when he shaves). Martin rarely walks when he has the option to skip.
The “Mom's On Facebook!” Effect. -12
It's nice that the band figured out how to make a decent video. (If you're pressed for time, “Paradise” depicts a man in an elephant suit who escapes from a zoo, rides a unicycle, stows away on a plane, and joins a band in South Africa.) The problem is that this video is a pastiche of videos Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze made fifteen years ago. Coldplay's inability to inhabit its time in any convincing way just makes me think that it spends months at a time on rowing machines and Stratego.
U2. -346
Seven out of ten times, Coldplay sounds almost exactly like U2—the U2 that exists now, not the wiry, feral U2 of 1980 (which would be a decent idea). U2 has not broken up. This is inefficient. Coldplay should consider copying Big Star or the Monkees.
“Oh, who would ever want to be king?” -10
Vagueness in song lyrics—blame whoever you want: Bob Dylan, indie rock, the one bad Beatles song, Steve Jobs—is now no big deal, even for a Top Ten act. So even though Martin told Billboard that “Mylo Xyloto” contains “a story . . . loosely a kind of romance in an oppressive environment,” the lyrics never rise above the level of foggy, hopeful clichés that have been placed in an order. “Paradise” is about a girl who is having a very bad day, and the lyrics include both imagery cribbed from embroidered throw pillows and a burp of internal branding (the words of the album's second single contain the title of the first single): “Life goes on, it gets so heavy / the wheel breaks the butterfly / every tear a waterfall / in the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes / in the night the stormy night away she'd fly.” It is never made clear if our hero, Mylo, can use his musical toes to make the rain go away. (This list of imagined “Mylo Xyloto” song meanings, by Amanda Dobbins, is better than the actual album by a factor of eight.) Martin likely knows this about himself—he is epically self-deprecating—which is perhaps why so many songs end using “whoa” and “ah” as a substitute for language.
The tunes are there, usually three to an album, but that is something you could say of even Coldplay's weakest contemporaries, like Maroon 5. What raises the band to some higher level of accessibility must be an averaging of Martin's guarantee never to shock or offend anyone—which parents value—and the toy-soldier brand of pageantry and celebration that underpins so many songs. Coldplay keeps throwing massive parades for itself, without explanation or merit. Some folks just love confetti.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army has taken full control of a small airbase in the eastern Aleppo countryside that had been held by Islamic State, helped by heavy aerial bombing by Russian and Syrian airforces, pro-state media and an army source said on Saturday.
The al-Jarrah airport is located in the hardline militants' remaining enclave in eastern Aleppo countryside, a region where they have mostly lost control to competing forces ranging from the Syrian army, U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces to Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels.
The airport was briefly stormed by the army's elite forces last March, but the militants repelled that attack on the base they had held since 2014.
A rebel source with an Islamist faction operating in the area said a convoy of army vehicles had been hit by the militants. The convoy had been ferrying reinforcements to the area on a strategic supply route south of Khanaser, located some 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Aleppo city.
The Islamic State militants are waging fierce battles with the Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias supporting it in the area. As the militants lose more territory, they have been resorting to more hit-and-run attacks that deploy suicide bombers from vast rural areas where they have taken shelter.
Russian and Syrian jets have also intensified their attacks on the town of Maskaneh, the last main town in the region west of the Euphrates River in eastern Aleppo countryside, former residents in touch with relatives said.
Dozens of civilians have been killed since last week in the aerial bombing of the remaining villages and towns in the area still in the control of the militants, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Separately Amaq, a news outlet affiliated to the militants, said U.S. coalition strikes on the villages of Shanina and al Rashid farm in the northern countryside of Raqqa killed at least seven civilians and injured 45 people.
U.S.-backed fighters have been waging a campaign to isolate and ultimately capture the city of Raqqa since November.
With air strikes and special ground forces from the U.S.-led coalition, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has been advancing on Raqqa city from the north, east and west.
Activists and former residents, as well as the U.K.-based monitor, have documented in the last month dozens of civilian deaths during air strikes in Islamic State-held areas that the SDF was pushing toward. Thousands of local Arab villagers have also been displaced.
"illegitimate child," early 13c., from Old French bastard "acknowledged child of a nobleman by a woman other than his wife" (11c., Modern French bâtard), probably from fils de bast "packsaddle son," meaning a child conceived on an improvised bed (saddles often doubled as beds while traveling), with pejorative ending -art (see -ard). Alternative possibly is that the word is from Proto-Germanic *banstiz "barn," equally suggestive of low origin.
Compare German bänkling "bastard; child begotten on a bench" (and not in a marriage bed), the source of English bantling (1590s) "brat, small child." Bastard was not always regarded as a stigma; the Conqueror is referred to in state documents as "William the Bastard." Figurative sense of "something not pure or genuine" is late 14c. Use as a generic vulgar term of abuse for a man is attested from 1830. Among the "bastard" words in Halliwell-Phillipps' "Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words" are avetrol, chance-bairn, by-blow, harecoppe, horcop, and gimbo ("a bastard's bastard").
As an adjective from late 14c. It is used of things spurious or not genuine, having the appearance of being genuine, of abnormal or irregular shape or size, and of mongrels or mixed breeds.

Love. It's something we all want, but when you consider that there are over 300 million people in the country and 7 billion people on the planet, it's amazing that two people in love would have had the chance to meet, let alone connect.
Finding someone - the right someone - can seem daunting with so many people out there, but what if you could crunch the numbers to figure the odds of finding that perfect someone for you? And then what if you could maximize the chances of meeting him or her?
Well, it's all been done and we'll show you how, on today's Just Explain It.
After considering things like looks and personality, age and location, and intangibles like chemistry, the chances of finding Mister or Miss Right can seem statistically impossible.

Well, hopefully you will find some measure of comfort in the story of Peter Backus.
In 2008, after three years of not having a girlfriend, Peter Backus, then- a London graduate student, wanted to find out how many potential girlfriends he had. So, he wrote a short research paper, appropriately titled, "Why I Don't Have A Girlfriend."
The basis of his tongue-in-cheek paper was the Drake equation, developed by astronomer Dr. Frank Drake in 1961 to calculate the probability of finding extraterrestrial life in our galaxy that can communicate with Earth. But instead of looking for life on another planet, Backus was looking for love in London.
So, using statistics and some guesswork, Backus started off with the population of the United Kingdom and began multiplying it by the fraction of women in the country, the fraction of women who live in London, who are age-appropriate, and have a college degree. He estimated the number of college-educated women in London he might find physically attractive and who would find him attractive, who are single, and with whom he might get along.
After crunching the numbers, he found he had a 1-in-285,000 chance of meeting a potential girlfriend suited to his tastes. That was only 26 women in all of the United Kingdom! Well, it seems he found one of those 26, or eased up on some of the criteria. Shortly after writing the paper, Backus met a girlfriend and they will be getting married this week!
Let's say you want to figure out the odds for yourself. First, take a look at the U.S. Census website, the state or local government website in your community that compiles statistics, as well as surveys that are conducted on the characteristics important to you, like location, gender, and age.
Next, factor in other things that may be significant to you such as a college degree or owning a pet. Put all those numbers in the equation, and Voila! You have your love-match probability.

After you figure out your chances, get the most out of them no matter what they are. Michael Kaplan, co-author of “Chances Are” a book about probability and unlikely occurrences, says your actions can increase or decrease the probability of a rare event like finding true love. Just like driving safely can decrease your chances of getting into an accident, while driving recklessly can increase it, Kaplan says putting yourself in situations where you're likely to meet someone will increase the likelihood that you'll find true love. So, instead of staying home and sitting on the couch every night, go out and try to meet someone!
It's not rocket science, even if some have looked to outer space to make sense of the odds.
So, tell us, did you learn something? What do you think your chances are of finding mate? Do you have a love story that beat the odds? Give us your feedback in the comments section below, or on Twitter using #JustExplainItNews.
Kaiju fans are in mourning today. Emi Ito may not be a household name but anyone who grew up watching the Godzilla movies on television remembers the two magical fairies who would sing those lovely lullabies to Mothra, the giant moth. The identical twins were perhaps the most memorable human characters in the Godzilla series, and Emi and Yumi Ito were the two actresses who played the roles. They recorded hit albums in Japan going by the name “The Peanuts” and were one of that country's first pop sensations, one of the few that became well known internationally.
The sisters Emi and Yumi Ito, were born Hideyo and Tsukiko Ito on April 1, 1941 in Aichi prefecture. They were discovered by Watanabe Pro founder Sho Watanabe, a music impresario who first saw them performing at a club in Nagoya as the Ito Sisters. In 1958 brought them to Tokyo, where they were dubbed The Peanuts. The pair debuted in 1959 with “Kawaii Hana” (Cute Flower) and gained popularity through their appearances on the musical variety show “Shabondama Holiday” (Soap Bubble Holiday). In 1961, they achieved international immortality when they appeared in the movie MOTHRA as fairies, or pixies, called “shobijin” (small beauties) who had telepathic communication with Mothra, giving The Peanuts a somewhat supernatural aura. They returned to serenade Mothra in GODZILLA VS THE THING (1964) and GHIDRA THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER (1965). The Peanuts also came to the U.S. where they appeared on the popular variety TV shows The Ed Sullivan Show and The Danny Kaye Show. The duo retired from show biz in 1975. Ito was 71 and is survived by her sister.
Rush Limbaugh closed the first hour of his radio show on his flagship station, WABC, with 1:03 of dead air on Thursday.
From WABC's online feed of the final commercial break of the first hour:
While advertisers have fled Limbaugh's show since his misogynistic attacks on Sandra Fluke, the first hour of every show since those attacks aired on March 1 has concluded with at least one ad leading into an ABC News break at the top of the second hour. On Wednesday, the first hour concluded with an ad from Matrix Direct, which has told radio stations to stop airing its ads during The Rush Limbaugh Show.
At least 46 advertisers have reportedly dropped their ads from Limbaugh's radio show since his attacks on Fluke.
UPDATE: Similarly, during the commercial break that led into the show, there was 2:38 of dead air:
It's unclear why nothing could be heard during these periods of the broadcast.
Going to the doctor's office is never a fun experience. But when patients are met with a lack of resources and assumptions about their sexuality, a checkup can turn into an unpleasant experience.
Young bisexual women face these issues with every visit, and it was addressed when researchers previewed the Young Bisexual Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Study at the 519 Church Street Community Centre on Jan 24.
“We know that young bisexual women experience a number of disparities in their sexual healthcare,” says Cheryl Dobinson, the project's principal investigator and director of community programming and research at Planned Parenthood Toronto.
During four focus groups held in August, 35 bisexual women (ages 16 to 29) disclosed just what those disparities are. Doctors assuming the women are either straight or lesbian, not considering the possibility of bisexuality, knowing little about bisexuality and not providing bi-inclusive sexual-health resources were some of the common concerns the women addressed.
“Doctors need to make a lot fewer assumptions and ask a lot more questions,” says Kate Sloan, 22, who took part in the focus groups and performed at the community launch at The 519.
“I've had doctors assume I was straight or assume I was gay based on what I was saying,” she says, adding that she felt awkward and scared as a result.
Assumptions abound, but sexual-health resources do not. Women in the focus groups reported that resources tend to be centred on penile-vaginal intercourse and that there is little to no information on sexual health for women who have sex with women.
Another recurring concern the research uncovered was that doctors had limited understanding of bisexuality. In fact, several of these women found themselves educating their healthcare providers on their sexuality.
The group's suggestions seem rather obvious: ask inclusive questions and don't make assumptions; design bi-specific resources and provide bi-inclusive sexual-health supplies; and educate healthcare providers on bisexuality.
The latter suggestion will happen soon enough, as Dobinson and her team are getting ready to release a fact sheet for healthcare providers. They'll also publish a research summary report, and there are plans to write academic papers and a proposal to develop an intervention for bisexual and queer women.
Dobinson and Planned Parenthood Toronto lead the project in partnership with Re:searching LGBTQ Health at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto. Women's Xchange (a Women's College Hospital research program) provided the funding, which was limited to $15,000. “We've stretched that to make it go a long way,” Dobinson says.
The youth advisory committee they set up has been an added help. Eight young bisexual women volunteered on the committee, and they were responsible for finding focus group members, helping to analyze the raw data, contributing to the creation of the first fact sheet and organizing the event that launched it.
Eloise Adams, 26, is a member of the youth advisory committee. She has a lot of hopes for the fact sheet. “Ideally, people will recognize their experience in it and feel less isolated. I hope it will empower people to seek understanding care.”
Dobinson's aspirations for the project largely echo those of Adams. “The hope is that through both education and awareness in our community and amongst healthcare providers, we improve conditions for young bisexual women.”
The group announced yesterday a $250,000 donation to continue providing cancer screenings to low-income women.

"People respond powerfully when they see politics interfering with women's health," Planned Parenthood said. "That's why we've seen a tremendous outpouring of support. These donations will continue to help expand Planned Parenthood's critical health care services nationwide, especially those affiliates impacted by the Komen cuts."Critics of Komen's decision say the charity caved to political pressure from the right, which has pushed aggressively to cut off public funding to Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions in addition to other women's healthcare services.
Komen has said it severed its ties with Planned Parenthood not because of politics, but because Planned Parenthood is the subject of a congressional investigation. Nevertheless, abortion-rights opponents cheered the move, saying a cancer charity never should have been involved with organizations that provide abortions.
Royce Da 5'9 also reveals his favorite battler and picks between Dizaster and Pat Stay.
Ahead of the release of their self-titled album, PRhyme (a rap duo consisting of Slaughterhouse member Royce Da 5'9 and legendary producer DJ Premier) took part in a Twitter Q&A in conjunction with @OnlyHipHopFacts. During the session, the two artists answered a variety of questions from fans including a few on the culture of battle rap.
Responding to a question asking for his thoughts on the upcoming Dizaster vs. Cassidy battle, Royce Da 5'9 says that he would bet on Dizaster.
They're both great lyricists .. I'd bet on Diz tho RT @Steeezzzzzz: @Royceda59 thoughts on Diz vs Cassidy and who'll take the W? — Nickle (@Royceda59) November 23, 2014
Despite the incorrect spelling, we think Royce Da 5'9 is referring to Las Vegas emcee Danny Myers as his favorite battle rapper.
Royce picked between Dizaster and Canadian battler Pat Stay.
Royce also addresses whether it's likely fans will witness either himself or anyone else from Slaughterhouse entering the battle arena following Joe Budden's match-up against Hollow Da Don at “Total Slaughter.” Rumors have been circulating for several months about another member of the crew potentially battling, most notably Joell Ortiz and Crooked I, although Royce Da 5'9 has also hinted at it in past interviews.
That's a possibility RT @ShaneK25: @Royceda59 is Royce or anyone from slaughterhouse gunna battle again ? — Nickle (@Royceda59) November 23, 2014
Finally, Royce Da 5'9 suggested King Los face one of rap's top artists in a hypothetical battle. Royce isn't the only battle rap affiliate to pick Los and Drake as industry rappers with potential to succeed as battlers.
Drake RT @OffsetRoemello: @OnlyHipHopFacts @Royceda59 who would you set @iamKingLos up to battle if he wanted to battle?? — Nickle (@Royceda59) November 23, 2014
DJ Premier also weighed in on battle rap culture. He questioned why battle rappers appear to be unable to make a commercially successful record despite their high lyrical ability.

I've been wanting to paddle the Cloquet River in northeast Minnesota for a few years now. I read “Wild Country…Still” in the Minnesota Conservation Volunteer magazine, which originally piqued my interest, and the more I researched the river, the better it sounded!
Looking at a map, the Cloquet River looks like a squiggle running roughly parallel to the north shore of Lake Superior, through a remote and undeveloped stretch of Minnesota's Arrowhead Region. It offers stretches of whitewater paddling and primitive riverside campsites. I never really hear anyone in the Twin Cities talk about the Cloquet. The Boundary Waters and various wild rivers far north of the Canadian border are a common topic of conversation, but the Cloquet seemed like it was relatively unexplored territory, which struck me as odd, considering its closeness. That also made me want to check it out even more.
In his Guide to Minnesota Outdoors, Jim Umhoefer describes the Cloquet as “...one of the state's most primitive canoe routes. Most of the river flows through the wild lands of the Cloquet Valley State Forest, inspiring a sense of isolation that explorers may have felt.”
As luck would have it, I came across a notice that the University of Minnesota at Duluth's outdoors club (UMD RSOP) was running an overnight trip on the Cloquet. The trip was open to non-students, and I'd heard that the school had a great environmental education degree and outdoor recreation program, so I figured this would be a quick and easy way to test the waters of the Cloquet. I called my buddy, Jeff, to see what he was up to, and after a few minutes on the phone, he signed on—let the adventure begin!
When I read Erica Barnett's piece yesterday about a small Phinney Ridge apartment project sent back to Design Review for a 4th time, I thought of my religious upbringing and Jesus' lament in Matthew 23:24 : “You blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.” Despite recent positive moves toward a more aggressively pro-housing stance, including defunding the change-averse neighborhood councils and passing the Housing Levy, etc, our instincts are still to miss the forest for the needles on each tree.
The project in question is a rare multifamily development in the heart of Craftsman land, and residents have objected loudly and often to things like the lack of A/C (the norm in Seattle) and the terrifying possibility of commerce. From Barnett's piece:
One woman was concerned that the building's two live-work spaces would create traffic and crowd nearby sidewalks. “If you're maybe somebody who has clients coming and going [from the] live-work units, going in and out, and if you're on Greenwood, they're going to be crossing the sidewalk.
Others suggested an aesthetic test, with neighbors as judge and jury:
Give us a building that gives us joy to walk by. It's like that saying, ‘I don't know what art is but I know it when I see it.' Well, I don't know what good architecture is, but I know it when I see it.
There has been some noise lately that the ire directed at single family zones and neighborhood councils is misdirected, that it's cynical to lay the blame upon them in the midst of an unprecedented building boom. And it's true, we're building roughly 13,000 new units per year, a record pace, and 9,000 planned for each of the next 3 years.
But it doesn't really matter that we're building. What matters is how much and where. Seattle is growing by 16,000 people per year, so 13,000 units is likely just enough to tread water, as recent slowing in the rate of rent growth shows. The more worrying sign is the 26,000 units planned for the next 3 years, and the 45,000 people likely to move here in the same period. That leaves a lot of (mostly well-paid) people, with nowhere to turn, bidding up the rent in our “naturally affordable” housing stock.
Despite our best intentions, it seems that the momentum toward upzones in exchange for Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) will induce very few new units in our multifamily zones, and that most developers will either walk away or pay the fee. With 1). these new fees likely to be passed directly into market-rate rents, 2). single-family zones remaining mostly untouchable, 3). a clear shortage of planned units, and 4) angry neighbors holding back production on account of laundry/unit ratios, it's hard to be optimistic about our ability to keep up with growth.
We need to get to the place where housing at all levels is seen as a social good, and that the burden of process should be on those who wish to restrict it.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) - A woman says she learned the water she's been drinking is from the toilet and now her residence hall roommate will have to explain.
The victim says she lost weight and her appetite and couldn't figure out why. That's when she claims she learned via Snapchat that her roommate, Tierni Williams, had been dumping water from the toilet into her water bottles.
According to an affidavit, video shows Williams getting liquid from the toilet with a styrofoam cup, then transferring it into water bottles on her roommate's side of the dorm. Williams reportedly narrates during the video, laughing and using expletives while stating her roommate is "gonna get sick from this" and it's "nasty."
Williams is charged with adulteration of food, liquid with bodily injury.
Officers arrested Williams, who has since bonded out.
BAMAKO (Reuters) - Five Malian soldiers and one civilian were killed in central Mali on Tuesday during an ambush on a convoy of the president of the High Court of Justice, the defense ministry said in a statement.
It was not clear who was responsible for the attack, but the high level target and army deaths point to the deteriorating security situation in Mali due to the growing reach of jihadist groups that roam country's vast desert expanses.
The convoy of Abdrahamane Niang was traveling between the towns of Dia and Diafarabé in the Mopti region, about 500 kilometers (311 miles) northeast of the capital Bamako, when it was attacked.
“Mr. Niang and his wife were recovered by the army. However, we report 6 deaths: five soldiers of the Malian army and the driver of the Honorable Niang,” the statement said, adding that others had been wounded.
No other details of the attack were given.
The rise of jihadist groups — some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State — continues to destabilize Mali, four years after French troops beat back an Islamist insurgency that began in 2012.
Around 4,000 French soldiers remain as part of Operation Barkhane, where they work alongside around 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Mali. But attacks on peacekeepers, aid workers and the Malian military are common.
Four U.S. Special Forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighboring Niger by fighters believed to belong to a local Islamic State affiliate operating out of Mali.
The G5 Sahel, an anti-terrorism taskforce of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania, plans to launch its first joint operations this month to target Islamists in the Sahel.
In further remarks on migrant workers from Africa, Interior Minister Eli Yishai said Thursday that many Israeli women have been raped by migrant workers “but do not complain out of fear of being stigmatized as having contracted AIDS.”
In an interview with Israeli newspaper Maariv, Yishai stated that the solution to the current problem is “more prisons and migrant detention camps," and that Israel must “prepare more military bases where we can jail all of them without exception.”
Yishai further stated that the “infiltrators, along with the Palestinians, will bring a quick end to the Zionist dream,” adding that “there is not another country that is as sensitive as Israel is to the rights of foreigners.”
“We have enough worries with issues of health and welfare in this country, and we don't need to import more worries from Africa,” Yishai said.
Yishai also told Maariv that “south Tel Aviv has turned into the garbage can of the country” and implored all those who speak out against him to “take the infiltrators and put them in their neighborhoods so that they see them every day, so that their children will try and play in the same pre-schools.”
In response to Yishai, the head of the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel, Michal Rozin, said that reports reveal that 87% of the referrals they receive report that the rape was committed by someone close to them, rather than by a stranger.
According to Rozin, most of the women that are sexually abused do not report it nor ask for help, adding that the reasons usually have to do with “feelings of guilt, shame, loneliness and fear, rather than the worry of contraction AIDS.”

“Politicians must not cynically use rape in order to express their positions on refugees and asylum seekers,” Rozin said.
Reut Michaeli, the head of the Hotline for Migrant Workers also responded to Yishai's comments, stating that the Interior Minister has “found the magic formula for making it to the headlines every other day without any parliamentary achievements.”
Yishai's comments came a day after dozens of protesters gathered near the central bus station in south Tel Aviv demanding the deportation of African migrants from Israel.
The protesters were calling “leftists are traitors” and holding up signs saying “south Tel Aviv, not South Sudan.” The right-winged activist Baruch Marzel said that they hope to hold demonstrations on a daily basis, adding that they will not stay quiet “until the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Interior Ministers will start to act, rather than talk.”
At one point of the demonstration, the protesters attacked Hananya Vanda, an Israeli citizen of Ethiopian origin who they mistakenly identified as an immigrant. After they realized Vanda is Jewish, the protesters said that they did not mean to attack him.

Major League Soccer and NBC Sports on Thursday will announce a new three-year agreement to televise 45 league matches and 4 United States national team games on the main network and on the NBC Sports Network, which will be the new name of the current cable station Versus. The deal will end the league's relationship with Fox Soccer, which recently signed a one-year deal to carry matches in 2011.
In each year of the deal, the NBC network will broadcast two regular-season M.L.S. games, two playoff games and two national team games (Soccer United Marketing, the marketing arm of M.L.S., owns the rights to the United States national team). The NBC Sports Network will televise 38 regular-season games, 3 playoff games and 2 national team matches. The agreement also gives NBC digital rights across all platforms. NBC was recently acquired by Comcast.
“Everyone at the NBC Sports Group is thrilled to begin this partnership with Major League Soccer,” Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Sports Group, said in a statement released by the league. “M.L.S. is a perfect fit for our new group, and we are uniquely positioned to help grow soccer in the United States with extensive coverage on NBC Sports Network, significant programming on the broadcast network and our growing digital platforms. Additionally, this agreement complements the partnerships five of our regional sports networks have with their local M.L.S. teams.”
All three M.L.S. television deals, which includes ESPN and Univision in addition to NBC, will expire at the end of 2014. According to the Sports Business Daily, the M.L.S./NBC deal is worth $10 million a year.
“Clearly there's a buzz about the sport and there's been great momentum over the last year.” M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber said Wednesday in a telephone interview. “Interest in soccer programming has grown recently. We wanted to capitalize on momentum for the sport. More importantly, we wanted to ensure that we finalized plans for 2012 with enough time to manage programming and the league schedule to avoid the challenges we had this year.
“This is a real step forward for M.L.S. and U.S. soccer. This is a world renown broadcaster known for production values and promotional expertise. That they are getting into soccer is a great statement about where the sport is today.”
Garber added: “The key thing for us relates to 2014, this three-year deal allows us to align all our TV relationships to end concurrently at end of '14 seasons and provides us with a potential opportunity to have more exclusive relationship with a broadcaster. Way to early what plans will be three years from now.”
Asked if those plans might include an M.L.S. network, modeled after the NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball channels, Garber would only say “it's too early to comment.”
Before the start of the 2011 season, M.L.S. and Fox were locked in protracted negotiations that concluded with a one-year deal. Under terms of the deal, Fox agreed to improve its coverage of the league with pre- and postgame shows that it branded as “Soccer Night in America.” Fox, however, continues to carry its nightly report from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and although that show has increased its M.L.S. coverage, it remains focused primarily on the English Premier League, a situation that has irked M.L.S. officials for years.
But Garber was quick to say that “this was not a negative statement about Fox Soccer, it's a positive statement about NBC Sports and its newly branded network. Fox has done a terrific job promoting sport. and we hope to keep working with them.”
In November 2006, 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston was killed by police during a raid conducted at the wrong house. Ms. Johnston fired at the police officers as they were breaking in through her living room window. Three officers were injured, but Ms. Johnston was struck 39 times and died at the scene. In July 2007, Mike Lefort, 61, and his mother, Thelma, 83, were surprised and thrown to the ground when Thibodeau, Louisiana police burst into the wrong house with a "no knock" warrant. Thelma suffered from a spike in her blood pressure and had a difficult time overcoming the shock. In March 2007, masked police officers in Jacksonville, Florida, mistakenly burst into the home of Willie Davis, grandfather of murdered DreShawna Davis, and his mentally disabed son. The pair were forced to the ground, where they watched helplessly as police tore apart the memorabilia from DreShawn's funeral. The drug sale that never happened was said to involve all of two crack rocks worth $60.
Location:
One would think after Atlanta police killed 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston, that they would get the idea, but they haven't. Last Friday, 1/4/08, a SWAT team, serving an ordinary drug search warrant, invaded the Ohio home of Tarika Wilson -- an innocent woman -- shot and killed her, and shot her one-year-old son. "They went in that home shooting," her mother said at a vigil that night. The boy lost at least one of his fingers. Two dogs were shot too. SWAT teams were created to deal with extreme situations, not routine ones. Yet police now conduct tens of thousands of SWAT raids every year, mostly in low-level drug enforcement. The result is that people like Wilson and Johnston continue to die in terror, with many thousands more having to go on living with trauma. But it's all for a drug war that has failed and can't be made to work. It's time to rein in the SWAT teams.

WebUSB connects remote devices directly to the browser via the web
The WebUSB API provides a way to safely provide developers acces to USB devices over the web. The API is familiar to developers who have been using native USB libraries and shares the existing physical USB specifications.
With WebUSB hardware manufacturers will be able to provide cross-platform JavaScript SDKs for their devices. The key advantage of WebUSB is that it is a universal format that can be used with a multitude of devices and device categories, just like USB itself.
Essentially the API allows USB-connected devices like keyboards, 3D printers and more complex Internet of Things devices to be addressed directly by web pages. The project originates from Google engineers and is now available to developers using the latest Chrome Canary:
This is really blowing my mind at the moment... webusb + Arduino pic.twitter.com/96ZXnp3m0f — Sam Saccone (@samccone) July 18, 2016
WebUSB takes security into account by design as there are origin projectors, similar to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), to natively block unauthorized use of USB devices connected to the web directly. WebUSB devices will also always prompt users to authorize the use of a device before connecting to it.
Web technologies are increasingly merging with many different classes of products and blurring the lines between what is a local resource and what is a remote resource. The ability to use USB devices directly from the browser offers some interesting possibilities, but it's worth noting that the WebUSB specification is currently a W3C draft specification and there is no guarantee that it will be adopted widely.

October 9, 2017: Conspiracy Theory Kickstarter Closes Today And The Game Will Not Go Into Distribution
In today's crowded market, we're finding more and more that stand-alone games are ephemeral items, hitting store shelves and then vanishing from the public consciousness within a month or two. Of the thousands of new games published over the last few years, only a fraction have kept any long-term shelf presence. This is an industry-wide situation; many discussions with our fellow publishers often lead to "how do we best measure success these days?".
It was that current market attitude toward new games that led us to take our latest project, Conspiracy Theory, to Kickstarter. When the project launched last month, we had no idea of the level of demand. We had showed the game at a few places, including Gen Con, and players liked it, but we were left with the question: Should we publish this?
The Conspiracy Theory Kickstarter project has funded, and even met a few stretch goals, but it was not a runaway success. This tells us to publish, yes, but only for direct sales. There's enough demand to print a profitable game, but perhaps not enough to reinvest that profit into inventory for distribution. Instead, we're going to fulfill our Kickstarter commitments and offer the remaining copies through Warehouse 23 and our Amazon storefront.
Thank you to everyone who has supported us. You'll like the game! If you've not yet joined, the Kickstarter project closes later today, so there's still time, barely, to jump in. And retailers: We are making the game available direct from our warehouse to your store. Please contact us ASAP if you want to take advantage of our case special. Hurry. We're closing that promotion down this week.
-- Steve Jackson
PS - Since the game will not go into distribution and there will almost certainly be no supplement published, I'm adding ten RED cards to the set. These open up a new mode of play. They were intended for later, but if there's not likely to be a "later," let's get them out there now and have fun with them.

When lawyers filed a class action lawsuit in 2010 against Trump University, they could hardly have expected that six years later they'd be coming up against the president-elect in the courtroom.
But that's exactly what stands to happen during the trial, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 28, as Trump and his lawyers will defend against allegations that Trump University defrauded students by presenting itself as an accredited institution and pressuring people to spend up to $35,000 for classes taught by people advertised as “hand picked” by Trump.
The Trump University lawsuit isn't the only legal headache hanging over the president-elect. New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who also brought a case against Trump University in 2013), is investigating Trump's foundation, after it was found in October to have violated state law by soliciting donations without the proper charity certification. Additionally, the FBI is conducting a preliminary inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's foreign business ties, NBC reports, a potential conflict that had already caused Trump to distance himself from Manafort. And Trump has sued two D.C. restaurateurs for pulling out of deals to operate in his new hotel.
“It is unusual for a president-elect to be entering the Oval Office with these types of live legal issues involving the business entities that he had been running,” says Caleb Burns, a partner at Wiley Rein LLP focused on election law and government ethics.

Trump will now have to juggle these trials and investigations while also getting his administration in place by Jan. 20, when he becomes leader of the free world. It is perhaps ironic that the husband of his general election opponent paved the way for the potential legal problems that may follow him into the Oval Office; in a 1997 case involving then-President Bill Clinton and Paula Jones, who was suing him for sexual harassment, the Supreme Court ruled that a sitting president isn't immune from litigation over actions done before taking office.
But Burns cautions that there's a crucial difference between the case Clinton dealt with and the ones confronting Trump: Clinton was sued personally, whereas Trump's cases concern disputes with businesses that he is or was involved with. “Those matters will continue to progress and make their way through the legal process, but those matters aren't aimed at Donald Trump personally,” Burns says. “Therefore they in all likelihood will not have much of an effect on his presidency.” It also means that in cases like these in which Trump is a witness, not the defendant, judges might be more reluctant to compel the president to testify. “My instinct would be that a judge would take great pains to avoid that situation,” Burns says.
The most immediate issue for Trump is the Trump University trial beginning this month. With Trump's new status as president-elect, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel has advised both sides to consider a settlement rather than trial, “given all else that's involved.” Trump's attorney Daniel Petrocelli indicated Trump might be willing to settle, despite Trump's past reticence. “I could settle these cases for peanuts… but I'm not a settler,” Trump told TIME of the case last November. Petrocelli has also said he'll file a formal request to delay the trial until after Trump's inauguration.

If the parties do not agree to a settlement, however, Trump will have to testify, though Judge Curiel will allow him to do so via video rather than appearing in court. And Curiel denied a request Thursday to ban campaign statements from the trial. This could include any speeches, tweets, sexual misconduct allegations, tax history, corporate bankruptcies or details about his charitable foundation. It could also include inflammatory statements Trump made about Curiel; in May, Trump called Curiel “a hater” and “very hostile” and said Curiel's Mexican heritage creates a “conflict of interest” given Trump's hardline immigration stance.
Trump's lawyer argued this campaign information “carries an immediate and irreparable danger of extreme and irremediable prejudice to defendants, confusion of issues and waste of time.” But Curiel wrote on Thursday that he wouldn't issue a “blanket ruling” because Trump's attorneys did not specify which statements they wanted banned.
Voters knew they were choosing a businessman to be their president, and a litigious one, at that. A USA Today analysis found that Trump and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. Trump prides himself on deal-making and standing tough to opponents, at least in posture. But as Trump cedes control of his foundation and businesses to members of his family, which he's signaled that he'll do, Burns says these cases will largely become their problem. President-elect Trump, after all, will soon have much bigger things to worry about.

Portugal has been named as the cheapest holiday destination in the world for Britons this year.
The country's perennially popular southern coastal region, the Algarve, came top in the Post Office's annual Holiday Costs Barometer, which takes into account the average price of eight essential purchases, including an evening meal for two, a beer, a coffee and a bottle of suncream, in 44 popular spots.
The Algarve pipped Bulgaria's Sunny Beach, with the total cost of the eight items coming in at the equivalent of £33.36, just 17p less than its Eastern European rival. Spain's Costa del Sol followed in third, ahead of Marmaris, Turkey, and the Czech Republic.
The Japanese capital of Tokyo, where the items cost £58.47, on average, was the only destination outside of Europe to feature in the top 10.
After a tumultuous year for the pound, which fell heavily against the euro and dollar in June, before regaining some ground, British holidaymakers are being urged to keep a close eye on how currency affects costs before deciding where to travel.
“Keeping an eye on rates is a smart move,” said Ian Strafford-Taylor, ceo of currency analysts FairFX. “Even over the course of the last three months, we've seen difference of 8 per cent between the pound-euro exchange. The truth is that you're only forced into accepting a poor rate if you have no other choice.”
Cancun is the third cheapest long-haul destination
“Holidaymakers who are truly savvy will be planning their travel money now and they'll be the ones who get the biggest bang for their buck.”
Andrew Brown of Post Office's travel money said it also pays to research where in-resort prices have fallen. For example, in the Algarve the cost of a evening meal for two is down 5 per cent on last year.
“Holidaymakers can do little about sterling's value but they can do their homework and plan trips to resorts or cities where prices for meals, drinks and other tourist staples are low,” he said.
“Much of Europe still offers good value, with prices on the ground falling in half of the European destinations we surveyed.
“Further afield Tokyo and Cancun are good bets for bargain hunters but don't discount Cape Town or Bali. If the rand (South Africa) and rupiah (Indonesia) fall in value, low costs on the ground could make these great choices, too.”
South Africa ranked 11th (£65.37) in the Post Office's price survey, with Indonesia 13th (£67.11). The Post Office said costs in Bali had more than doubled in the last three years, when its leading resort, Kuta, took top spot. Cape Town, too, has fallen in the rankings, from third last year to 11th, with the pound losing value against the rand.
Though sterling hit dizzy heights in the summer of 2015, when £1 bought €1.44, Brown pointed out that its value is now comparable to where it was in 2012.
“This year's report puts 2016's sterling fall into perspective,” he said. “The pound may be weaker than 12 months ago but if you compare today's rates with those five years ago, sterling is stronger now against 60 per cent of our 40 best-selling currencies.”
Brown cited South Africa, Mexico and Japan as examples of where Britons are finding much better value than they were five years ago, with sterling up 41 per cent against the rand and 25 per cent against the peso and the yen.

It was promoted as the chance of a lifetime: Mom-and-pop investors could buy shares in celebrity businessman Donald Trump's first public company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts.
Their investments were quickly depleted. The company known by Trump's initials, DJT, crumbled into a penny stock and filed for bankruptcy after less than a decade, costing shareholders millions of dollars, even as other casino companies soared.
In its short life, Trump the company greatly enriched Trump the businessman, paying to have his personal jet piloted and buying heaps of Trump-brand merchandise. Despite losing money every year under Trump's leadership, the company paid Trump handsomely, including a $5 million bonus in the year the company's stock plummeted 70 percent.
Many of those who lost money were Main Street shareholders who believed in the Trump brand, such as Sebastian Pignatello, a retired private investor in Queens. By the time of the 2004 bankruptcy, Pignatello's 150,000 shares were worth pennies on the dollar.
He has no qualms about screwing anybody. That's what he does. — Sebastian Pignatello, ex-investor who lost thousands in Trump bankruptcy
"He had been pillaging the company all along," said Pignatello, who joined shareholders in a lawsuit against Trump that has since been settled. "Even his business allies, they were all fair game. He has no qualms about screwing anybody. That's what he does."
Trump's bid for the White House relies heavily on his ability to sell himself as a master businessman, a standout performer in real estate and reality TV.
But interviews with former shareholders and analysts as well as years of financial filings reveal a striking characteristic of his business record: Even when his endeavors failed and other people lost money, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee found a way to make money for himself, to market his Trump-branded products and to pay for his expensive lifestyle.
Trump was the chairman of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts in Atlantic City from 1995 to 2009, his only outing as the head of a major public company. During that time, the company lost more than $1 billion, financial records show. He also was chief executive from 2000 to 2005, during which time share prices plunged from a high of $35 to as low as 17 cents.
Publicly traded Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, also known as Trump Entertainment Resorts, cost shareholders millions of dollars, but greatly enriched Donald Trump. Despite losing money every year under Trump's leadership, the company paid Trump handsomely, including a $5 million bonus in the year the company's stock plummeted 70 percent.
Trump received more than $44 million in salary, bonuses and other compensation during his time at the company, filings show. He also benefited from tens of millions of dollars more in special deals, advisory fees and "service agreements" he negotiated with his company.
Trump's campaign did not make him available to respond to specific questions about the company, but in a recent Washington Post interview, Trump said he "made a lot of money in Atlantic City," adding, "I make great deals for myself."
He expounded: "They say, 'Why don't you take the casinos public or something?' You know, if you take them public, you make money on that. All I can say is I wasn't representing the country. I wasn't representing the banks. I wasn't representing anybody but myself."
Corporate governance experts say it's rare for executives of public companies to suggest that they haven't been looking out for the shareholders who financed them.
"When companies go public, when they first invite investors in ... they say: 'I promise you, you will come first. We are here to create shareholder value, and that's why you should trust us,' " said Nell Minow, the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises shareholders on corporate governance issues. "For them to say, 'I don't really care about you,' it's basically your (sell) signal. Who's going to make sure my interests as a shareholder are going to be protected?"
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts started out as a holding company that owned the Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, and then it steadily added other Trump properties.
Because it was publicly traded, Trump could sell shares and quickly raise money while other corners of his empire were in distress. Virtually all of Trump's other businesses are privately held, so key information about their performance is hidden from view.
The company began advertising its public offering of stock in 1995, saying shareholders would benefit from "the widespread recognition of the 'Trump' name and its association with high quality amenities and first class service."
When it debuted that year on the New York Stock Exchange, Trump's company raised $140 million from investors, at $14 a share, and said the money would go toward expanding the Plaza and developing a riverboat casino in Indiana.
But much of that money went to pay off tens of millions of dollars in loans Trump had personally guaranteed, filings show. Those loans were taken out before the company went public, but Trump's private fortune could have been at risk if they went unpaid.
The company got off to an encouraging start. An improving national economy and an upturn in Atlantic City gambling helped shares soar to a peak of $35 in 1996. That boosted the value of Trump's stake in the company and helped him return to the Forbes 400 list - the magazine's ranking of America's wealthiest people - for the first time since 1989.
The early success didn't last long. In less than a year, the company paid premium prices for two of Trump's deeply indebted, privately-held casinos, the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle. In essence, he was both buyer and seller, able to set whatever price he wanted. The company bought his Castle for $100 million more than analysts said it was worth. Trump pocketed $880,000 in cash after arranging the deal, financial filings show.
By the end of 1996, shareholders who had bet on a rosy Trump future were now investors in a company with $1.7 billion of Trump's old debt. The company was forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on interest payments, more than the casinos brought in, securities filings show. The unprofitable company couldn't afford the upgrades it needed to compete with newer gambling rivals.
Spooked investors fled the company in 1996, sending its share price down to $12. As millions of dollars in shareholder value evaporated, the company gave Trump a $7 million pay package, including a 71 percent raise to his salary, financial filings show. Trump defended his compensation by telling the Wall Street Journal, "Other than the stock price, we're doing great."
"He ran these companies into the ground," said Graef Crystal, an executive-pay consultant who watched the company at the time, in an interview.
As the company spiraled downward, it continued to pay for Trump's luxuries. Between 1998 and 2005, it spent more than $6 million to "entertain high-end customers" on Trump's plane and golf courses and about $2 million to maintain his personal jet and have it piloted, a Post analysis of company filings shows.

Finding opportunities in health care through biotech
Scientific and technological innovations continue to propel opportunities in the health care sector (XLV). Some of the catalysts that have led to increased investment spending in the health care sector include, but are not limited to, the following:
an increased understanding of the disease mechanism
genomics enabling precision medicine
improved therapeutics
In conjunction with these innovations are certain demographic trends that are feeding into the overall demand for health care solutions:
increase in life expectancy
an aging global population that is expected to reach 1.4 billion people over the age of 60 by the year 2030
the degree to which our aging population will spend money on health care, recognizing that half of all lifetime health care expenditures occur from the age of 65 and higher
increase in the rate of developing chronic illnesses globally
Accepting that there is a greater demand for health care solutions today and an increase in the types of health care solutions that are now available (or are on track to someday be available), the issue then becomes how best to find investment opportunities within the sector.
Large pharmaceutical companies facing the ‘patent cliff'
Valid systemic concerns can be presented with respect to the potential negative impact of regulatory measures, such as the Affordable Care Act. But with heightened pricing scrutiny on drugs and health care products in general, I believe that these risks are primarily borne by large pharmaceutical companies. These large pharmaceutical companies also face the risk of falling off a “patent cliff” in the coming years as several of their larger revenue producing drugs are scheduled to come off patent and face generic competition. In 2016 alone, drugs with pre-expiration values totaling a combined $56.4 billion are subject to this patent cliff, according to S-Network Global Indexes, Inc.
As a result of these patent expirations, large pharmaceutical companies will need to replace these sources of lost revenue while also finding ways to help minimize the systemic concerns cited earlier. In order to accomplish this, some might suggest that they should turn to their own research and development for a pipeline of new drugs and solutions. The problem is that the majority of larger pharmaceutical companies has not been investing adequately, or successfully, in their own R&D and thus do not have a pipeline where they can confidently turn.
Before casting any aspersions on “big pharma” in this regard, one should understand that the R&D process in the health care sector is not an elementary one and often results in expensive and non-successful results. For example, it is estimated that the development of a new drug costs around $2.6 billion on average and that less than 12% of the developed drugs that make their way to clinical trials ultimately win regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).*
Biotech companies to become buyout targets
From our perspective, this quandary presents investment opportunities not only for manufacturers of generic drugs but also for biotechnology (“biotech”) companies focused on innovation, as big pharmaceutical companies will likely look to acquire these companies to help replace revenue lost to the patent cliff.
As opposed to the multi-pronged focus of large pharmaceutical companies, the primary focus of biotech companies is to develop new and innovative health care solutions. While this focus does not make the process of bringing a new drug to market any easier or less expensive, the previously mentioned patent cliff and recent momentum on the side of regulatory approvals present reasons for biotech optimism. With respect to the latter, 45 new drugs were approved by the FDA in 2015. This represented the second-highest total of drug approvals in at least 35 years, and half of the drugs that were approved were for rare diseases.*
Biotech companies with approved drugs, or drugs believed to be near the final approval stage, should look very attractive from a mergers and acquisitions standpoint to large pharmaceutical companies in this environment. In this regard, there was $219.4 billion in worldwide biopharma M&A transaction volume in 2015 and $130.7 billion thus far in 2016, according to data from Biopharm Insight provided by S-Network Global Indexes, Inc., including completed and announced deals, asset deals and acquisitions of divisions. This is a trend we, at Hennion & Walsh, see continuing in the future.

Studies warn of abrupt environmental effects of warming
One report says sudden climate shifts could appear in years or decades and calls for an early warning system. Another says a widely accepted emissions cap is too high.
As a result of the burning of fossil fuels, industrial activity and deforestation, the amount of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has soared to levels not seen in millions of years, with global temperatures rising by about 1.5 degrees. The scientists say the accelerating gas levels increase the risk of reaching various "tipping points," leaving nature and society little time to react.
Scientists based their findings, in part, on the study of climate history as recorded in tree rings, ocean sediment and ice cores. They found the timeline punctuated by big, sudden changes, including ocean circulation shifts and mass extinctions.
A National Research Council report says the planet is warming so quickly that the world should expect abrupt and unpredictable consequences in a matter of years or a few decades. Among the changes already underway are the sudden decline in Arctic sea ice and climbing extinction rates, the report found.
Scientists sounded alarms Tuesday with a pair of studies challenging the idea that climate change is occurring gradually over the century and that its worst effects can be avoided by keeping emissions below a critical threshold.
"To willfully ignore the threat of abrupt change could lead to more costs, loss of life, suffering and environmental degradation," said the council, an arm of the National Academies that produces reports for the U.S. government.
Even slow and steady changes in climate can have sudden repercussions, the report says. A slight increase in sea level could be enough to overtop a levee during a storm, and a tiny rise in ocean acidity from carbon dioxide could make seawater inhospitable to coral.
The scientists also call for an early warning system to anticipate sudden climate shifts. They envision a network of satellites and land-based monitors tracking ocean temperatures near polar ice sheets and methane levels in the Arctic. Those monitors would work alongside existing networks for drought, famine and groundwater depletion.
"We watch our streets, we watch our banks ... but we do not watch our environment with the same amount of care and zeal," said James White, a climatologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder and chairman of the committee that wrote the report.
A separate study published Tuesday challenges a widely held view that the world can avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change by limiting emissions to 1 trillion metric tons of carbon since preindustrial times. Staying below that ceiling would keep global temperatures from rising more than 3.6 degrees, a threshold the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has endorsed.
An international group of scientists, health experts, legal scholars and economists under the auspices of Columbia University says the cap is too high. Fossil fuel emissions must be kept to half that and global warming held to about 1.8 degrees to avert disastrous consequences, they say, including many feet of sea level rise and irreversible ecological harm.
"If we don't get on a downward emissions pathway this decade, young people are likely to inherit a climate system with dramatic consequences out of their control," said James Hansen, the climate scientist who led the study.
Stabilizing Earth's climate would also require restoring 100 billion metric tons of carbon to forests and soils through better management, the authors say. Going beyond typical research papers, they call for a global tax on carbon to facilitate a transition to nuclear and renewable energy.
Hansen, who retired this year as director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies to join a policy-oriented initiative at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, is an outspoken advocate of aggressive climate-change-fighting measures who has sometimes faced criticism from fellow scientists.
Martin Hoerling, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory, said he does not agree with some of the conclusions of Hansen's group, including predictions that the 3.6-degree warming target would eventually raise sea level about 20 feet. But he shares their sense of urgency.
Congressman Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has put an end to a number of bills that Boehner planned on sneaking past Congress – and his ingenious method involves a 500-yard dash.
Much to the chagrin of the American public, members of Congress rarely vote on the hundreds of bills that are passed per year.
Most Congressional bills are passed in a nearly empty chamber, and Massie explained to the Young Americans for Liberty at the University of Cincinnati, members of Congress like to use voice votes to pass unpopular bills.
There are two reasons Congress loves the voice vote: the first is that because there's no record of who voted, they can't be held accountable when the bill passes.
The second reason is that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) has sole discretion to decide if there is a “quorum” (218 congressmen) present in the room sufficient to take a voice vote. Massie says frequently there's only ten congressmen present. All Boehner has to do is squint and say that there's a quorum present and he may hold a voice vote.
As long as no one requests a recorded vote, Boehner is free to do this.
That's where Massie's 500-yard sprint comes in.
Massie says he's discovered that "it's about a 500-yard dash between my office and the floor of the House." So, when Boehner starts to do voice votes, Massie sprints to the House floor and demands a recorded vote. That means there has to be a real quorum: 218 live people on the record with their votes. Several unpopular bills have died as a result of Massie's dash.
Passing bills without recording votes, and without Congressmen present, frustrates the democratic process, and “it happens way too often,” said Massie.
“It only takes one congressman to stand up and say ‘Mr. Speaker, I request a recorded vote'… and I've done that a lot,” Massie said, to laughter from the Young Americans for Liberty students.
Slowly but surely, over the past several years, ECM Records has forged relationships with some of New York City's most impressive musiciansno mean feat given that, despite the Big Apple no longer being the jazz mecca it once was, it certainly remains a lightning rod for some of the world's most creative musicians, ranging from trumpeterand saxophonistsand, to pianistsandall of whom have been represented, either as guests or leaders, on some of the most uncompromising and impressive music to be released in recent timesnot just on the heralded German label, but anywhere, period.Add to that list pianistwho, like Taborn's superb first recording as a leader for the label (2011's Avenging Angels ), makes his own ECM debut by contributing another fine installment to a label that has, across four decades beginning with's Piano Improvisations Vol. 1 (1971) and's Facing You (1972), defined the litmus test against which all subsequent solo piano recordings are measured.Parks is a rarity: a young musician who, at a time when such things are difficult if not impossible, spent his first few professional years mentored by an older musician, in this case. The trumpeter met Parks when the pianist was 15, recruiting him three years later and giving him an opportunity to see how it was done both on the road and in the studio , so that when Parks stepped out on his own with the acclaimed Invisible Cinema (Blue Note, 2008), he was well and truly ready.In the ensuing years, Parks has become increasingly in demand, including membership with the egalitarian, the promise of its 2011 eponymous Nonesuch debut confidently delivered with more recent live performances , and with, whose Star of Jupiter (Wommusic, 2012) represented yet another career milestone for the upwardly mobile guitarist.None of which prepare for Arborescence, a suite of eleven largely spontaneous creations that reflect a great many touchstones while, at the same time, speaking with a voice that has fully matured, now plainly assertive of its own personality. The opening "Asleep in the Forest" and darkly pastoral "Elsewhere" feel somehow a kinship to French composer Erik Satie, were he to have hailed from the forests of the Northwestern United States (where Parks grew up) instead of the southern estuary of the Seine River in Northwestern France. Minimalistic hints imbue the repetitive motif-driven "In Pursuit," where Parks' virtuositynever an end, just a meansis more dominant, while the skewed and, at times, abstruse lyricism of "Branchings" and "Past Presence" hint at's innovations in the realm of spontaneously composition, despite Parks' independent voice a constant delineator throughout this 50-minute set.With Parks turning 30 a week prior to Arborescence's October 15 release, the pianist's milestones continue to accelerate. His past work may have been consistently impressive, but Arborescence represents the true watershed of Parks' arrival as an artist whose future shines brighter with every passing year.
THE European Union last night agreed a multi-billion pound bailout of Nick Clegg's storm-tossed emotions.
European finance ministers said the rescue package would prevent the deputy prime minister from staring out the window for hours or turning up to Parliament in his underpants with ‘help me' scrawled across his chest in blackcurrant jam.
Under the plan each student in Britain will be paid £9000 a year to be Mr Clegg's best friend, with bonus payments for singing him to sleep or entertaining him with a puppet show.
Britain's newspapers will receive multi-million pound EU grants for training their journalists not to ask Mr Clegg unfriendly questions about the prime minister's affair with News International.
And more than £300m will be spent filling the Lib Dem leader's iPod with remastered versions of the entire Funkadelic back catalogue as a direct replacement for whatever is making him cry.
An EU spokesman said: “It's not an exact science and we won't know if the fiscal medicine is working until he talks to his nine year-old son.
“If the child tells him about a painting he did at school it means the situation is stabilising. But if he says ‘papa, why is a dreadlocked, middle class white man squeezing dog jobbies through the letter box?' then it may need a second tranche of emergency funding.”
Meanwhile critics have stressed that Mr Clegg's £135,000 salary, chauffeur-driven Jaguar and rent free 115-room mansion in Kent should be more than enough to help him cope with being called a dick by some fucking students.
The Detroit Tigers bolstered their rotation for 2018 by signing right-hander Mike Fiers to a one-year contract.
The deal is worth $6 million, according to Jerry Crasnick of ESPN.
Fiers reportedly chose to take the one-year deal with Detroit over an apparent two-year offer from the Baltimore Orioles, according to Crasnick.
Fiers was non-tendered by the Houston Astros earlier this month following a rocky 2017 campaign for the world champions. In 29 appearances (28 starts) for the Astros, Fiers posted a 5.22 ERA (76 ERA+), 1.428 WHIP, and 146 strikeouts while walking a career-high 3.6 batters per nine innings and hitting an American League-high 13 batters. He did not pitch for the Astros in the postseason.
Fiers is going from first to worst next season, as he'll join a Tigers team that lost a league-worst 98 games in 2017. The 32-year-old should help a Tigers staff by eating innings in 2018, something he does quite well; indeed, Fiers has thrown at least 150 innings in each of his last three seasons.
TIGERS' PROJECTED 2018 ROTATION
Pitcher IP ERA WHIP K/BB Michael Fulmer 164.2 3.83 1.154 114/40 Matt Boyd 135.0 5.27 1.556 110/53 Mike Fiers 153.1 5.22 1.428 146/62 Daniel Norris 101.2 5.31 1.613 86/44 Jordan Zimmermann 160.0 6.08 1.550 103/44
In seven major-league seasons with the Astros and Milwaukee Brewers, Fiers owns a career record of 42-47 with a 4.15 ERA, 1.291 WHIP, and 688 strikeouts (8.5 per nine innings). He threw a 134-pitch no-hitter for the Astros in 2015.
The ordination of Father Joseph Zhang Yinlin, 44, as coadjutor bishop of Anyang diocese in Henan province, mainland China, on August 4 was conducted in a way that respects church law and would appear to signal that the Chinese authorities wish to reach an accord with the Holy See.
The ordination was presided over by the 90-year-old Bishop Thomas Zhang Huaixin of Anyang diocese and took place at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, Anyang city, in a ceremony attended by 1,400 people, including 75 priests and 120 nuns, UCA News—the main Catholic news agency in Asia, reported. Some Chinese priests travelled from the United States, Italy and France for the event, AFP reported.

Three bishops assisted Bishop Zhang Huaixin as co-consecrators: Joseph Shen Bin of Haimen, Joseph Yang Yongqiang of Zhoucun and Wang Renlei of Xuzhou, according to UCA News. All four enjoy the approval of the Holy See and are recognized by the Beijing Government.
It is particularly significant that bishops not recognized by the Holy See did not attend the ceremony. This appears to be the clearest indicator to date of Beijing's desire for harmonious relations with Rome, and its wish to reach a mutually acceptable accord with Rome on the nomination of bishops.
The new bishop was born in Henan province in 1971 and studied at the National Seminary in Beijing from 1992 to 1996 when he was ordained priest. Prior to his ordination he served as vicar general of the Anyang diocese, assisting Bishop Thomas Zhang Huaixin. He was elected as candidate to be bishop on April 29 and had papal approval.
As of today, the new bishop is coadjutor to the diocese's elderly bishop in the eyes of both Rome and Beijing, but is expected to succeed him in the near future as pastor to its 40,000 faithful, 30 priests and 120 nuns.
Today's ceremony took place under strict security. One church source told UCA News that the authorities limited participants to 25 people from each of the diocese's 17 parishes. Another source present at the ordination reported that those who did not have identity cards could not get to the venue. “The security check was strict as in the airport. We were checked twice,” and despite the rain the authorities had “hundreds of police and firemen to maintain order,” the source added.
A priest who concelebrated at the ordination Mass, but asked for anonymity, told UCA News that nearly 500 people were turned away from the ceremony by authorities and had to follow it on TV sets in parish classrooms.
The new bishop comes from “a traditional Catholic family,” a priest who was present at the ordination told AFP. “I'm glad he is becoming our bishop. He has a very deep faith and I know he will be able to accomplish his ministry well,” he added.
“This is a new beginning for Anyang Diocese,” a local priest told UCA News. He described the ordination as a good start for the church in Henan and also for the church in China.
Today's ceremony was the first episcopal ordination in mainland China since the July 2012 ordination of Bishop Ma Daqin in Shanghai. It was also the first since Francis became pope and since China and the Holy See resumed their dialogue at the end of June 2014. It may be considered as a first fruit of that dialogue.
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that another candidate elected to be bishop in the same province of Henan, Father Cosmos Ji Chengyi of Zhumadian, was also present at today's ceremony. He too has papal approval, but the date for his ordination has yet to be announced. If it is conducted in the same proper ecclesial manner as today's one then that would be further confirmation that Sino-Vatican relations are developing in a positive way.
College students who graduate with degrees in undergraduate college majors like pharmaceutical science and computer, chemical and industrial engineering tend to go on to earn high incomes over the course of their careers. The problem is African Americans tend to be under-represented in those majors – less than any other group – and what you major in while at college, it turns out, is more important than ever when it comes to earning more money over the course of a career.
This according to a report released earlier this year by Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW). African Americans who graduate with degrees in industrial and manufacturing engineering, for example, go on to earn about $76,000 in median annual wages over the course of a career. But, African Americans – who represent 12% of the U.S. population – only represent 5% of graduates in that major. Those graduating with degrees in Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Administration go on to earn $84,000 in annual median income, yet African Americans only represent 6% of those grads overall, according to the CEW's study. (See below for our gallery on the 10 Highest-Earnings Majors for African Americans.)
Also, African-Americans were also found to represent only 7% science, technology, engineering, and mathematics majors, or STEM.
So where are all the African-American students if they're not in the top-earning majors? On the other end of the spectrum, it turns out. CEW's study showed that they tend to be over-represented in college major programs that, on average, lead to lower wages. For example, they represent 21% of Health and Medical Administration Services majors, which brings in a median annual wage of $46,000. African-Americans represent 21% of Human Services and Community Organization, and 19% of Social Work majors, which each lead to median salaries of $41,000 or less.
Other groups – whites, Asians, Hispanics – also experienced higher or lower career wages after graduating with certain degrees. But African-Americans are underrepresented in the top-earning fields of study, over-represented on the low end and tend to earn the least amount of money over the course of a career as a result (Asians tend to earn the most of all groups), says CEW Director Anthony Carnevale, one of the authors of the report.
“African American women especially are highly concentrated in low earning majors, oftentimes to do with community service—a lot of psychology, a lot education, a lot of humanities,” says Carnevale. “The education majors get jobs but at low wages.” African-American men, he added, are distributed a bit more broadly among majors, but still experience the same trend. There is, Carnevale stresses, nothing wrong with choosing one major over another, but that decision can have a profound impact on earning power over the course of a career. “They're going to choose majors based on their interests and values but they should at least know what the economic consequences are and there is no system in place to (inform them) and that's especially true for lower income populations, where there's a very high concentration of African Americans.”
Carnevale says that since the 1980s the overall value of a college degree – in terms of its impact on career earnings – has doubled relative to a high school degree. “What is even more striking and a stronger shift has been the difference in value among fields of study—it's grown even more, from an economic point of view.”
Carnevale says he hopes the study enlightens those about what kind of monetary return they can expect from the degrees they pursue, noting that nowadays there are about 1,100 distinct occupations to choose from (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and 2,500 college majors at schools in the U.S. “I think it points out the need for more transparency in helping students and administrators and other people as well, figure out the economic value of fields of study or college majors.”
Image caption The East Anglia Offshore Windfarm Zone will power five million homes, developers say
The inland cabling route from the first part of a multimillion-pound offshore wind farm project in East Anglia has been put out to public consultation.
Developers said cabling for the East Anglia One wind farm off the Suffolk coast would start near the River Deben at Felixstowe and run north of Ipswich.
A new converter station next to the site at Bramford would then collect the energy to put on to the national grid.
The plans are up for consultation in Suffolk and Norfolk.
People have until 30 March to air their views.
The cabling route forms part of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR), released by the East Anglia Offshore Windfarm Zone's developers, Scottish Power Renewables and Vattenfall.
The document also details findings from technological and environmental surveys on the site of East Anglia One - the first of six wind farms which are planned to be built 14km (9 miles) out to sea.
'Very, very careful'
Libraries in Suffolk and Norfolk are holding copies of the report.
Members from the wind farm development team will be answering questions as part of the consultation, in Lowestoft, Woodbridge, Bramford and Felixstowe, between 20 and 23 February.
Derek Christie from the company said he expected some people to raise concerns about the proposals, including the route of underground cabling, but said the firm had been "very, very careful" to plan it away from people's homes and any areas that would create major disruption.
He said people in Norfolk would also be interested in the consultation, with Great Yarmouth's harbour expected to be a hub for the building of the wind farm zone.
Construction on East Anglia One is expected to begin in 2015, with a completion date of 2018.
Mr Christie said it could have between 200 and 600 turbines.
The full East Anglia Offshore Windfarm Zone, when built, is expected to power five million homes, developers said.

There was nothing wrong with the 458 Italia , but Ferrari fixed it anyway.
By most any measure, the Ferrari 488 GTB is a better — and certainly faster — car, but when the company designed it, they weren't just thinking of the road version of the car. They were thinking ahead to the race version. Formula 1 is definitely important to the global Prancing Horse family, but Ferrari's mission has long been to take its road cars to the racetrack.
The 488 GTB is undeniably gorgeous, inside and out. It certainly resembles the car it replaced, the 458 Italia, but there's one big difference in the profile that will allow any casual fan of the brand to pick out the 488 GTB : the enormous air intakes located just ahead of the rear tires. And because this is Ferrari we are talking about, designer Flavio Manzoni and his team integrated them so nicely that suddenly we see a 458 Italia and think: Man, that would look better with a pair of big, horizontally bisected air scoops.
Autoweek readers were among the first to know why those big air scoops are on the side of the 488 GTB . A couple of turbochargers are mounted to the 3.9-liter V8, and turbos need air. The engine does indeed pump out 661 hp, compared to 570 for the larger, naturally aspirated V8 it replaces.
Ferrari, and captive tuner Michelotto Automobili, developed the track version of the car in concert with the designers and engineers for the street car. The 488 race car “is based on a road car that already incorporated track-friendly solutions as standard,” claims Ferrari.
Ferrari developed two basic professional race cars from the 488: the GT3 and the GTE. But that's where the Ferrari 488 design becomes so innovative—for the first time, they are essentially the same car.
The No. 62 IMSA GT Le Mans 488 GTE Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC
The GT3 classification has been around since 2005, and its specifications are regulated by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, or FIA. At least two dozen groups around the world, including the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and the Pirelli World Challenge, sanction races for GT3 cars. Each sanctioning body retains the right to change the specifications for individual models, to slow down the fastest cars and speed up the slowest.
Previous GT3 Ferraris have mostly been an offshoot of the cars produced for the Ferrari Challenge, the one-make series for wealthy amateur racers. There is indeed a 2017 Ferrari Challenge 488—the car made its debut in April at Yas Marina in Abu Dhabi—and with its sealed engine benefiting from some aggressive computer mapping that Ferrari says gives it 670 hp, it could potentially be the quickest of all the factory-built 488 race cars in a straight line. Neither the 488 GT3 nor GTE are allowed by the sanctioning bodies to have anywhere near 670 horses. Gotta keep the field even, you know.
It should be obvious why GT3 cars are so important to manufacturers. After decades of either supporting their own race cars or having racers build cars from street cars, GT3 — and the fast-growing GT4 class, which are slower but less expensive — lets manufacturers actually sell completed race cars. And since the GT3 cars are raced all over the world, resale value is boosted; those moving on from GT3 have a global market for used race cars. And when the race cars race, and fans watch, it has to be good for brand recognition.
Not only is the Ferrari 488 GT3 an exceptionally well-conceived race car, Ferrari took the bold step in designing it so it could be converted, rather easily, into a GTE car. Which means you start out with the Ferrari 488 GT3, and after you get some experience in that class, you can convert the car to GTE specifications, making it legal for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. That's huge: Drivers of GT3 cars now have to either buy or rent a suitable car if they want to race at Le Mans — no GT3s allowed. To change over a 488 GT3, you must change the front and rear wings and arches for the wheels, and there's work you must do to the engine — but the projected cost of about $125,000 is reasonable because, in the end, you have a Ferrari 488 GTE.
The No. 61 Pirelli World Challenge 488 GT3 Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC
If you want to buy a new Ferrari 488 GT3, expect to write a check for about $600,000. That's a very expensive GT3 car. But even if you spend $150K extra to make it into a Ferrari 488 GTE, $750,000 for a brand-new car that could win its class at Le Mans is pretty appealing. At least, that's how it all works out on paper—your mileage may vary. So what's the difference in the cars? Here's the tale of four Ferraris: In stock form, the 488 GTB is slightly lighter than the 458 Italia, weighing in at 3,431 pounds. The twin-turbo, 3.9-liter V8 has 661 hp at 8,000 rpm, fed to the rear wheels through a transverse seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Base price is just under $250,000, but few leave the showroom at that—you can easily add $100,000 worth of options, the vast majority of which don't make the car go any faster. Then there's the Ferrari 488 GTE/GTLM. There's only one team, and one car, regularly racing in the U.S.: the No. 62 Risi Competizione Ferrari 488 GTE of Toni Vilander and Giancarlo Fisichella, both Ferrari factory drivers. There's no argument that they are outnumbered—the Chevrolet Corvette team always has two C7.Rs, and the Ford Chip Ganassi Racing team brings two, three or four Ford GTs, depending on how bad Ford wants to win the race. But if you're going to the O.K. Corral with only one gunslinger, Risi is a good choice: The Houston-based team, founded by Ferrari dealer Giuseppe Risi, did introduce the Ferrari 360 GT to the North American racing market in 2002—and the 430 GT in 2006, and the 458 in 2011.
The No. 31 Pirelli World Challenge 488 GT3 Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC
Those who have covered IMSA sports-car racing over the years have often found Risi crew members surprisingly candid. Take, for example, Rick Mayer, lead race engineer. So, how about that turbocharged engine, Rick? “Don't really care for it,” he said. Settings are more sensitive, the “Balance of Performance” directives from IMSA are harder to assimilate.
Plus—and Mayer didn't say this, but he didn't need to — what difference does the engine make, as long as it is reliable, has the proper power band and gets acceptable mileage? IMSA will slow down the fast cars, speed up the slow cars to the point where absolute horsepower, as delivered from the factory, is less relevant than you'd expect. Mayer does like the 488 GTE's extra downforce—up 50 percent on the street car over the 458 Italia—and he says the basic platform is solid and suitably stiff.
Ferrari 488 GT3, IMSA: So intent on getting the Ferrari 488 GTE ready for its global debut at Daytona in January 2016, the company didn't have the 488 GT3 ready, so the car made its U.S. debut in March at the Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring. And quite a debut it was: The Scuderia Corsa team of Christina Nielsen and Alessandro Balzan, with help from Jeff Segal, not only put the new Ferrari on the pole for the GT Daytona class, it gave the car its first win. Nielsen and Balzan, newly teamed for 2016, won the season championship.
Scuderia Corsa, appropriately based in Beverly Hills, California, was founded in 2011. Giacomo Mattioli, one of the founders, owns Ferrari Beverly Hills, which (again, appropriately) is the highest-grossing Ferrari store in North America. Born in Modena, the Italian home of Ferrari, Mattioli graduated from law school and began working for Ferrari. He subsequently proved that his success at the company was not entirely due to marrying Enzo Ferrari's granddaughter, and the company sent him to the U.S. in 1995. Scuderia Corsa co-founder Art Zafiropoulo made a fortune in the semiconductor industry, then bought into some Ferrari dealerships. To say Scuderia Corsa is well-funded is an understatement.
The No. 63 IMSA Daytona 488 GT3 Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC
Not surprisingly, Mattioli loves the Ferrari 488, street and race version. “It's a wonderful car, a genuine step forward,” he said. “It has done very well for us in every aspect.”
For Long Beach, the BoP regulations had the 488 GT3 at 2,965 pounds, more than 200 pounds heavier than the 488 GTE. It would have been the heaviest car in the field, except that the BoP added 10 kilograms to the Mercedes-AMG GT3s, bringing it to 2,976 pounds. The 488 GT3 started out the season, incidentally, 44 pounds lighter than it was at Long Beach. The BoP further reduced the 488 GT3's fuel tank size and made the refueling restrictor smaller. The GT3 cars run on “IMSA 100 E10” fuel ($10.65 a gallon), a mix of 100-octane VP unleaded gas with 10 percent ethanol. The GT Le Mans cars use “IMSA 100 E20” ($11.52 a gallon). That said, Risi's Rick Mayer believes that the 488 GT3 cars would actually be faster than the 488 GTEs if the GT3 cars had the same tires the GTEs do. Continental is the supplier of all the IMSA WeatherTech classes except for GT Le Mans, where — in a nod to IMSA's partnership with the FIA and ACO — teams are allowed to choose their tire manufacturer. Every team in the IMSA GTLM class chooses Michelin. Still, Mayer's assertion seems surprising, given the 488 GTE's lighter weight and more powerful turbo (at 5,000 rpm, for example, the GT3 is allowed a boost ratio of 1.587, the GTE 1.764), but he knows a lot more than we do, and a Michelin representative backed him up. Both classes run on 18-inch tires and wheels; the stock 488 GTB, as mentioned, has 20-inchers.
Ferrari 488 GT3, Pirelli World Challenge: It was not a surprise to see the Toronto-based R.Ferri Motorsport team start the season strong, fielding the first Ferrari 488 GT3 car in the Pirelli World Challenge series, racing in the top GT class. Newly hired driver Alex Riberas finished sixth and third at the season-opening St. Petersburg doubleheader, and he finished fifth at Long Beach. Remo Ferri's team has been racing since 1991, mostly in the Ferrari Challenge series, most recently running six cars there. He owns Ferrari of Ontario and Ferrari of Alberta, and he said he really wanted to go racing in the new Ferrari 488 GT3. “I love the race car,” he said. “Ferrari did a magnificent job with it.”
What was a surprise in the Pirelli series was the entry of a second Ferrari 488 GT3 by Fort Lauderdale-based TR3 Racing, the only entry in this story not directly tied to teams that also own Ferrari dealerships. Italian driver Daniel Mancinelli, entirely an unknown quantity to the PWC people, was entered at St. Petersburg in the GTA category, as in “A” for Amateur — you don't move up to GT until you've shown you've got the right stuff. It didn't take long. Mancinelli, driving a car he had never raced at a track he had never seen, put the car on the overall pole—unheard of for a GTA driver. And, as you can imagine, he quickly lost the “A” from his entry designation. He could only manage finishes of 14th and 10th at St. Pete, but he qualified and finished fourth at Long Beach, one spot ahead of Riberas. So, finally: How fast? The fact that the IMSA WeatherTech series and Pirelli World Challenge both raced at Long Beach the same weekend gives us the only chance we'll have all year to make a comparison of how fast the IMSA Ferrari 488 GTE and GT3, and the PWC Ferrari 488 GT3, really are. Fastest, not surprisingly, was the IMSA Risi Competizione Ferrari 488 GTE, with a time of 1:17.043 on the 11-turn, 1.968-mile street course. Second was Mancinelli in the PWC TR3 Racing Ferrari GT3, at 1:19.169. Third was the IMSA Scuderia Corsa Ferrari at 1:20.203. It would also be interesting to compare the fastest lap times, but the Risi car crashed out on the first lap. And none was the fastest in their qualifying classes, period. The Risi Ferrari 488 GTE was third fastest in qualifying, the Scuderia Corsa 488 GT3 eleventh, and the TR3 488 GT3 was fourth. Of course, with the buzzard that is Balance of Performance watching over the time sheets, maybe not being fastest is a good thing.

The average American watches around 14 hours of online video per month. But how much do we know about who's paying for all of it?
The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday announced it will settle with Machinima, an entertainment company that produces content for gamers, for not being clear about how some of its videos were being funded. According to the FTC complaint, Machinima did not properly disclose that some videos were paid for by Starcom MediaVest Group, an ad agency hired by Microsoft to promote the Xbox One. The agency said that a "small group of influencers" were paid thousands of dollars to create endorsement videos for the console and video games, but were not told to disclose where that money came from.
“When people see a product touted online, they have a right to know whether they're looking at an authentic opinion or a paid marketing pitch,” said Jessica Rich, the FTC's Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, in the release. “That's true whether the endorsement appears in a video or any other media.”
Under the settlement, Machinima promise to disclose how videos are being funded. The firm did not have to pay a fine.
"Machinima is actively and deeply committed to ensuring transparency with all of its social influencer campaigns," the company said in a statement. The company also noted that the videos in question were posted in 2013 -- prior to a major management shakeup at Machinima. "We hope and expect that the agreement we have reached today will set standards and best practices for the entire industry to follow to ensure the best consumer experience possible," the statement said.
Microsoft and the advertising agency Starcom were also held accountable for their actions and received letters from the FTC. But the agency ultimately felt that the practice was more the exception to the rule for these companies. And, the FTC said, Microsoft and Starcom both made efforts to stop the bad practices.
"The companies also quickly required Machinima to remedy the situation after they learned that Machinima was paying influencers without making the necessary disclosures," the FTC release said.
The Federal Trade Commission released updated rules regarding product endorsements in 2013, in part to address concerns that consumers weren't getting clear information about whether some online ads were paid endorsements or independent opinion. That's been a particular problem on social media networks, where character limits and short attention spans leave little room for fine print.
[The FDA just recalled Kim Kardashian's Instagram post]
The guidelines clearly state, however, that disclosures must be "clear and conspicuous," regardless of medium.
Last year, regulators settled with Sony and an advertising company it hired to promote the handheld Vita console, saying that the agency asked employees to talk up the product on their personal Twitter accounts without disclosing their connection to the ad agency. The complaint also said that the claims made were overstated.
[The FTC says Sony lied about how innovative the PS Vita is.]
The FTC also went after advertisers in 2010 for posting fake reviews on iTunes games. But this is the first time the agency has cracked down on video endorsements.
The move stands out as the importance of video, particularly in the gaming world, continues to rise. Video advertising can be expensive to produce, but often is easier to target than television ads and earns advertisers more money than other online ads. Video itself has also emerged as a fast-growing medium on social networks. Facebook and Twitter have focused considerable effort on making video a more shareable medium, particularly by way of Instagram and Vine.
The success of Twitch, now owned by Amazon, has proven the appeal of gaming videos in particular. YouTube also recently launched a gaming-specific platform to gather the millions of hours of game-related content into one hub. Machinima itself has built a small empire, and raised millions in funding.
As with other video stars, however, many of the people who make their living crafting game-related videos rely heavily on sponsorships and advertising to pay the bills. Wednesday's announcement makes clear, however, that those relationships must be fully disclosed to viewers.
HIALEAH, Fla. (WKRC) - A Florida man was arrested after a fit of rage directed at AT&T employees, .
Jorge Jove, 64, had confronted AT&T employees before for parking their truck in front of his driveway. When the phone company showed up outside his house again on Wednesday to work, Jove lost it.
After the workers told him they were parked where they were supposed to be and would move their vehicles as soon as they finished the job, Jove went into his house and re-emerged with a gun in his hand.
One of the employees caught the whole scene on video with his cell phone as Jove circled the trucks with his gun in hand before opening fire.
"There's a guy shooting out my tires," the employee can be heard telling police in the video.
According to police, Jove fired at least 18 shots, taking aim at the radiators of the trucks after he shot the tires.
No injuries were reported.
Police are investigating whether or not he meant to hit any of the employees or just their vehicles.
One of Jove's neighbors was completely stunned by the violent outburst.
"Never, never. This man is impeccable," said Luisa Morales. "He's a retired firefighter. He's an impeccable man."
In a statement, AT&T said, "We're grateful nobody was hurt, and we're working with law enforcement in their investigation. Because there's an active investigation, I need to refer you to them for any questions."
Riley passed away last week. Riley was not my dog.
Riley was, however, one of the best friends I ever had. He was an incredibly special dog, unlike any dog I have ever met. I am amazingly blessed to have known him, and I am incredibly grateful to the people who called him family that they were so open to letting Riley come visit us and spend time with our family. They, too, are pretty special people to know that they “owned” a dog with a heart bigger than anyone could contain. He showed love to everyone.
Riley was 14. He changed my life forever. And now I get to figure out what life without Riley looks like. I don't like that thought. I'll figure it out, but right now, I just want to share what an amazing being this dog was.
Meeting Riley
One day a few months after we moved to Shasta, Riley wandered over to smell things in our yard. Max was horribly afraid of dogs after being attacked by a dog at his dad's house in Texas, but I sent him outside with a ball. Riley LOVED balls, though trying to get the ball back from him was a challenge. Max and Riley bonded and became incredibly close over the next few days.
It was a perfect set up really. Riley came over to play for a few hours a day. Max got doggie time. I didn't have extra fur to clean up! Riley was just awesome. One day, Max's dad started loading Riley into his car as a surprise for Max when he picked him up from school. I had to remind him, “That's not our dog; you can't do that.” Riley looked at me as if to say, “What! I was gonna go for a ride!”
Riley started spending more and more time over at our house. He would sleep on our front porch. We put out a carpet remnant and a water bowl just for him. He walked with me and Claire every day. He had some days in which he was obsessive about being with us. Sometimes I felt guilty that he wasn't with his own family. But then his mom would call him, and he'd go to her immediately. He knew who is a mom was. He just knew he had work to do with other people.
Like me. When I first arrived in Shasta, I was rather emotionally beat up from our time in Texas. Shasta was intended to be a place of healing and spiritual respite. I didn't realize Riley was going to work on me… but I am grateful he did.
There was one walk where I went with Riley to a meadow near our house. Riley got the goofy puppy energy going and pretty much tackled me. Then he just looked up at me with those eyes as if to say, “Sorry. I forgot you're not a dog. But I wish you were.” He just gave so much love to me, to my kids. I loved Riley, I love Riley, more than I can describe.
Yet, he was not our dog.
A few months later, Max cried one day that we didn't have a dog of our own. I said, “Go out and play with Riley.” He cried, “But he's not OUR dog!”
I did a quick Craigslist search for golden retrievers and found Alex almost immediately.
Even with Alex in our life, Riley did not feel left out.
Alex and Riley became great friends almost immediately. I walked with them every day for the last four years around our neighborhood. Sometimes other dogs would come pack up with us. We went to the meadow. We played in the backyard. Sometimes we would just sit on the back patio together.
Alex loved Riley. They competed for balls. We walked together every morning. They swam in the creek whether it was 85° or 19°. They would disappear in the meadow chasing smells together. They would take turns rolling in things they shouldn't have. They would take turns avoiding being turned into a horse by Claire. (Riley was much more patient with Claire than Alex.)
When I would put Alex out to do his business, he would look for Riley. If he hadn't seen Riley in a while, he would go to Riley's house and try to find him and encourage him to come over and “pack up” with us.
Riley wasn't a part of our family, but he was one of our best friends.
I wish had words of eloquence to describe how amazingly wonderful Riley was, how healing he was to us, how full of love and playfulness. Right now I just have words of sadness. I miss him terribly.
I never had enough time or energy to play with Riley as much as I wanted to. He didn't mind. He waited patiently for me, for Max, for Claire, until we were ready. And when he felt we had enough of him, he moved on to another neighbor who he felt needed him.
A good friend mentioned that there are lots of new dogs in the neighborhood. There is the cycle of life and death, rebirth and we're just in the middle of it. We always are. Sometimes we can distract ourselves from the cycle of life, but it's always there underneath the surface.
I'm still grieving, and I guess I will be for a while.
Saying Goodbye
I knew about two months ago that Riley wasn't doing very well. He came home from a trip with his family after Christmas, and he felt different. By early January, I could feel him slowing us dramatically on our walk around the neighborhood. One day, I just knew.
I cried a lot that day. I put Alex inside and stayed on the back porch with Riley. I told him I knew. I told him it was okay for him to leave, that when he was ready, I was going to be okay. I thanked him for the love and lessons of heart-centered living that he gave me. I told him he would be with me in spirit forever, and he was the greatest dog in the world. (I'm sorry Alex!)
I cried a lot that day. I felt that I had said my goodbyes. We had a few more walks, and I took some more videos of him to keep my memory of Riley alive.
Last week, when Claire was sick, I had a dream that Riley's parents came to my house to let me know he had died. The next day, he disappeared, dying on his own terms in the neighborhood that was, and is, entirely Riley's. I knew by Thursday when I hadn't seen him, that the dream was his way of saying goodbye.
Riley was not my dog. But the Riley-shaped hole in my life is going to be there for a while.
The mix-up occurred just days after the airline started to fly Airbus A321 planes along that route.
A spokesman for the carrier confirmed to the newspaper that a version of the A321 that was not certified to make long flights over water—as on the route between Los Angeles and Hawaii—was accidentally flown that day.
"We also have an ongoing, thorough review of our policies and procedures," spokesman Casey Norton told the Post. "Immediately when we realize what happened, we notified the FAA and we are working and fully cooperating with them."
American Airlines later confirmed to CNBC that the event had occurred and said that it is working to ensure something like it does not happen again.
"Nobody was really at any kind of safety risk," Michael Boyd, president of Boyd Group International, said in a CNBC "Power Lunch" interview Monday.
Nonetheless, Boyd, an aviation consultant and former American Airlines employee, added that it was in fact a "screw up" on the company's part and most likely a clerical error since it is one of the most sophisticated airlines in the world.
"American just didn't do its job right. I can guarantee you this is not going to happen again at American Airlines."

10. Morocco
> Female-to-male income ratio: 0.28 (tied 8th worst)
> Labor force participation (m/f): 79% / 27%
> Literacy rate (m/f): 76% / 58%
> Pct. women in parliament: 17%
Morocco was one of the worst rated countries for women, according to the WEF's 2014 Global Gender Gap Index. Few nations had a greater disparity between men's and women's participation in the economy. Just 27% of Moroccan women were in the labor force, well below the 79% participation rate for men. Further, women with jobs earned an average of just $3,123 annually, versus nearly $11,000 for men — more than three times as much. Morocco also has a considerable gap in literacy rates. Just 58% of women were considered literate versus 76% of men.
9. Jordan
> Female-to-male income ratio: 0.18 (tied- 3rd worst)
> Labor force participation (m/f): 69% / 16%
> Literacy rate (m/f): 98% / 97%
> Pct. women in parliament: 12%
Just 16% of Jordanian women participated in the labor force, one of the worst rates in the world. The difference in incomes between men and women was also among the world's worst. While the average man in Jordan earned $19,300 annually, higher than in more than half of all countries reviewed by the WEF, the average woman earned only roughly 18% of that, or $3,442 on average. Additionally, despite the prominent international role played by Queen Rania of Jordan, women in general have limited representation in the country's political offices. Just 12% of parliament seats and 11% of ministerial positions were held by women, both among the lower rates in the world.

8. Lebanon
> Female-to-male income ratio: 0.27 (7th worst)
> Labor force participation (m/f): 76% / 26%
> Literacy rate (m/f): 93% / 86%
> Pct. women in parliament: 3%
Few nations were rated worse than Lebanon for women's political empowerment. Just 3% of seats in Lebanon's parliament were held by women, one of the absolute lowest rates. Further, none of the country's ministerial positions were occupied by women. One problem for many women in the country may be that religious laws cover issues of personal status, such as marriage and divorce. Despite passing a new anti-domestic violence law in April 2014, Human Rights Watch said the country still has significant room for improvement. In particular, the organization said that “Exempting matters governed by personal status laws from the domestic violence law undermines women's security in the home.”
CARLTON Football Club is delighted to announce contract extensions for both Matthew Kreuzer and Sam Rowe, who have put pen to paper on new deals this week.
Kreuzer has agreed to terms for a further two years, while Rowe will remain in the navy blue until at least the end of 2018.
Carlton's number one ruckman produced his best season to date in 2017, playing 21 games on his way to his first All Australian nomination earlier this week. The 28-year-old averaged 15 disposals, five clearances and 32 hitouts a game this season.
Rowe has been a regular senior player for the Blues since the start of the 2014 season, and was carving out a career-best season in 2017 before the 29-year-old ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in late May. The reliable defender finished fifth in the Club's best and fairest count in 2014, and equal sixth last season.
Head of Football Andrew McKay said the Club was thrilled to retain the services of both Kreuzer and Rowe.
“To Matthew's credit, he has been elite in his preparation and managing his body throughout the year and working closely with our high performance team which resulted in him playing 21 out of a possible 22 games this year,” McKay said.
“He is often referred to as a ‘heart and soul' player for our Club and we're delighted Matthew will be remaining in the navy blue for a further two years.
“Sam has been a consistent and durable performer for us since making his debut in 2013 and has been meticulous in his rehabilitation with his knee injury. The leadership and experience he has brought to our young backline has been invaluable and we look forward to welcoming him back for the start of the 2018 season.
“Matthew and Sam are integral members of the playing group and are both held in very high regard at the Club. We look forward to seeing them continue their careers in the navy blue.”
Kreuzer was selected by Carlton as the number one pick in the 2007 AFL National Draft and has since played 161 AFL games, booting 84 goals.
Originally taken by Sydney via the 2006 Rookie Draft, Rowe was selected by the Blues as a mature-age recruit in the 2011 NAB AFL Draft and has since played 82 senior games.
Yesterday, a Nassau County Supreme Court judge ruled that the Nassau County Police Department had improperly withheld records about its relationship with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, and agreed to release them at 10:30 this morning. About 45 minutes before the documents were due to become available, Nassau County attorneys appealed the decision and obtained a stay of the order.
In August, I reported that O'Reilly—who claims to be more powerful than anybody save the president—had pressured the NCPD into launching an internal affairs investigation into a detective that, O'Reilly believed, had been dating his estranged wife. In the course of reporting the story, I filed a request with the department seeking, among other things, any communications between O'Reilly and former NCPD Commissioner Lawrence Mulvey, as well as records of any investigations launched with information supplied by O'Reilly.
The NCPD denied the request in full. I appealed, and the NCPD denied that, too. In October, I filed a petition in Nassau County Supreme Court asking a judge to order NCPD to hand over the documents. Shortly thereafter, the New York Civil Liberties Union agreed to represent me in the matter. In December, in a court filing, the NCPD acknowledged that it had indeed conducted the internal affairs investigation I was asking about. Last month, Nassau County Supreme Court Judge F. Dana Winslow ordered the NCPD to hand over all the documents that were responsive to my request so he could examine them in his chambers.
At a hearing yesterday, after reviewing the documents, Winslow decided that the internal affairs investigation was exempt from the Freedom of Information Law and, with the exception of one page, would stay secret. But he ordered the release of approximately 17 pages of emails and written correspondence between O'Reilly and Mulvey. Much of that, he said, had to do with the construction of what Winslow described in court as an NCPD testing laboratory. The single page from the internal affairs report that Winslow ordered released, he said, was a Civilian Complaint Report signed by Mulvey. In my original story, I reported that Mulvey had directly ordered the investigation, and that the chief of the NCPD internal affairs unit told detectives it was highly sensitive because O'Reilly was considering making a donation to the NCPD Foundation, which is raising funds for the construction of a $48 million police training facility.
Yesterday, Winslow raised the possibility that the NCPD may have failed to hand over all the documents it had. Among the things I asked for in my original request were any records of police visits to addresses associated with the O'Reillys. At the time, the NCPD acknowledged that it had records of visits in its E911 system, and claimed they were exempt. Yesterday, Winslow said that there were no 911 records in the documents NCPD provided to the court. But there were, he suggested, apparent references to 911 calls. It wasn't clear whether those references appeared in the portion of the documents he had cleared for release.
Winslow ordered redacted versions of the correspondence to be made available to me, to the county, and to any interested members of the press at 10:30 this morning. At roughly 9:45 a.m., attorneys for Nassau County filed notice that they would appeal Winslow's decision. Under New York law, the order was automatically stayed. With the help of the NYCLU, I intend to oppose the county's appeal and file a cross-appeal arguing that the internal affairs records, as well as the correspondence, should be released.

33⅓ is a series of books dedicated to the most incredible musical albums ever made—one book per album, one author per book. Over the coming months, we'll be running excerpts from their in-depth essays. This week, Tennessee-based music writer Kirk Walker Graves introduces Kanye West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Here's Chapter One:
Lurking somewhere amid the tabloid covers and reality show cameos, in the icy silence between tweets, the periods of relative calm preceding fresh bouts of histrionics, lost within the noxious cultural static that clings to his very name, there has always been—in spite of his best efforts to distract us—the music. And in the first decade of the twenty-­first century, Kanye West created the best—the most consistently ambitious and thrilling—pop music of any American artist, hip-­hop or otherwise, during the period. From "Through the Wire"—the first single off his 2004 debut LP The College Dropout, and the cockiest anthem of survivor gratitude this side of disco—to "Lost in the World", the penultimate track on 2010's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (MBDTF), more mystic dare than pop song—he has staked his claim as the digital era's first pop visionary, a multivalent talent with an intuitive genius for collage. Best known initially as Jay-Z's wunderkind producer at the turn of the millennium, champion of the sample-­driven "chipmunk soul" beats heard in "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)" and "Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)", West's music now illuminates the pop skyline with a gauche radiance all its own.
For sheer scale and visionary brio, MBDTF is his masterpiece, the work that contains the fullest possible expression of his aesthetic vision. The album opens with a foreboding nursery rhyme chanted in a bad English brogue by rapper Nicki Minaj, and it ends with a relentlessly unanswerable question—"Who will survive in America?"—posed by late bluesologist Gil Scott-Heron, via a sample of his "Comment No. 1." Between those end stops lie 68 minutes and 38 seconds of closed—circuit narcissism, a buffet of sonic delights that blends rococo opulence ("So Appalled") with pornographic anxiety ("Hell of a Life"), suicidal ideation ("POWER") with feelings of omnipotence ("POWER"), redemptive humility ("All of the Lights") with go-­for-broke ambition ("Monster"). The album unites disparate samples in a spirit of bold experimentation, incorporating prog rock as an enjambment here, transmogrifying a sixties radio pop melody into a hook there. Each song crackles with the intensity of a manic episode, employing every color in the sonic palette to paint a pop fantasia that is sui generis. MBDTF is such a testament to the power of first-­rate American maximalism that one almost need look to literature—to twentieth century behemoths like The Recognitions and Women and Men—for an apt analogue. Simply put, the album has few peers in the way it stormed out of the gates and into the pop music canon.
That said, the 33 ⅓series is devoted to landmark pop albums of the past few decades. Why write a book on an album less than four years old? How much perspective on the music is possible? In human terms, the average four-­year-old has few tangible achievements outside toilet proficiency and a functional understanding of Velcro. And as music is such a vital force, a phenomenon as synonymous with life as respiration, shouldn't we apply developmental benchmarks to our judgment of its value? No sane person would presume to evaluate the legacy of a four-­year-old. For most of the music we come to cherish, our love anneals in the crucible of elapsed time. The passing years trace the grooves in the culture the music has made, put our first impressions on trial in the courts of evolved taste and popular opinion. We hear, say, "Hey Ya" in an antiseptic department store lobby and receive deliverance across a lost decade, borne back to the moment of polymorphously perverse joy we felt upon hearing it for the first time. A truly great record is a miracle of double endurance, thriving in the besieged sanctum of the heart—beating back the new music , the competition for our ardor—while simultaneously persisting through time in the byzantine officialdom of critical acclaim. We reflect on where and when a particular record became more than a record, looking for the point at which the music's charm collided with our own tender susceptibility. We find meaning, prophecy, validation, and mystery in those points of connection. Time then bequeaths the music to posterity, cultivating the growth of an intergenerational democracy, a world where tomorrow's grandparents can share their grandchildren's burgeoning enthusiasm for London Calling, Pet Sounds, The Chronic , and In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.
The question, therefore, remains: Why write a whole book about such a young album? MBDTF is a concentrated dose of Kanye West, who, in his way, is a concentrated dose of the still-­young digital era. Ours is a period of unprecedented and instantaneous access to books, films, fashions, and ideas. The vast majority of the world's recorded music is searchable and streaming, just a few clicks or swipes away. The arc of West's career reflects this digital ubiquity as no artist before him, the artistry of his samples a kind of transhistorical pop consciousness. And as the pop music canon continues to self-­codify, new technologies have made it easier than ever to document and endlessly share our mandarin obsessions and revelations. Blogs and now apps have become clearing-­houses for the kind of serendipity that dorm rooms and college radio stations used to provide. Kanye embodies our era's insatiable appetite to aggregate—to incorporate everything all at once—and MBDTF is the operatic sound of that insatiability set to music. To promote the album in the late summer of 2010, he even gave impromptu performances of new tracks at the headquarters of both Facebook and Twitter, where, at the latter, he opened his now infamous account.
There are many other compelling reasons to devote an entire volume to MBDTF. Few compete with the album's greatest theme, however, which is the saga of its creator's pathological need for greatness. More than a panegyric to excess or a celebration of his narcissism, MBDTF is a spiritual anatomy of Kanye West. Listen hard and you find that the fundamental conflict is between a child-­emperor and his irrational fear of oblivion. "My-Beautiful-Dark-Twisted-Fantasy"—say it aloud. It could be the title of an essay penned by a vengeful third grader. The album is a portrait of genius held hostage on all sides by ambition, frustration, and insecurity, an allegory about art as the only valid response to emotional crisis and the only authentic mode of redemption. If those descriptions sound a bit too highfalutin for a discussion about a pop star, that is because West is no ordinary pop star. In truth, it is unclear what he is, exactly, or what he might become. On MBDTF he often seems to bear more kinship to visual artists like Matthew Barney and Sigmar Polke than Lil Wayne or Prince.
From its swollen roster of diverse collaborators, to its polysemic tapestry of inspired samples and breathtaking hooks, to its creator's covetous wish to inherit the King of Pop's mantle, to the in-­studio awareness during production of the stakes for West's career, to its yawping desire to sound like nothing else before or since, MBDTF is a monument to its own pursuit of perfection. For critics and fans across demographics, listening to the album once in its entirety was enough to ratify its status as an instant classic—more exploding quasar than landmark—but a classic nonetheless.

The formula has worked well enough for the Ravens to win six games and earn a share of first place in the AFC North with the Pittsburgh Steelers. But even in the din after the Ravens' 19-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, quarterback Joe Flacco acknowledged that the way the offense had just played won't be good enough to get the team to the playoffs.
"We're not going to survive week in and week out doing things like that," Flacco said after the Ravens were held to just one touchdown and scored only three second-half points.
At times this season, the Ravens (6-5) have won largely in spite of their sluggish offense. They've been able to lean on the NFL's second-ranked defense and on the right leg of kicker Justin Tucker, who made all four of his field-goal attempts against the Bengals and is perfect on 27 attempts this season.
What has been good enough to beat the likes of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cleveland Browns and a reeling Bengals team doesn't figure to work against the Miami Dolphins, who come to M&T Bank Stadium on Sunday with an AFC-best six-game winning streak... or the following week, on the road against the New England Patriots (9-2)... or on Christmas Day against the host Steelers in what could amount to a postseason play-in game.
As they start preparing for the second game of what coach John Harbaugh billed last week as a six-game season, the Ravens seem to understand that how they're currently winning probably isn't sustainable. If they're going to outlast the Steelers and win their first AFC North title since 2012, their offense is going to have to find a way to be more consistent and explosive.
"I'd love to see numbers be through the roof, but numbers don't win games," Harbaugh said Monday. "We need to score more points as an offense. That's the bottom line, and we've just got to continue to find a way to do that. I believe we can do it, I know we can do it."
Through 11 games, the Ravens are tied for 23rd in the NFL in yards per game (334.2). They're averaging just 19.8 points per game. Only seven teams average less and only one of those teams — the Houston Texans — has a winning record.
They rank 28th in rushing yards per game (27.8), 29th in yards per play (4.9) and dead last in third-down efficiency (33.3 percent). Those numbers paint the picture of an offense that has scored one or no touchdowns in six of 11 games. The Ravens' 17 offensive touchdowns are the second fewest in the league, ahead of just the Texans (16).
Photos from the division showdown between the Bengals and Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium on Nov. 27, 2016
"We just have to execute better," Harbaugh said. "We have to get first downs. We have to stay out of the hole. When you get on the 10-yard line and you make a couple first downs and you get in that plus fringe range, you have to make a play. There's never any one thing. You've got to execute these plays in these situations."
The Ravens seemed primed for an offensive breakthrough Sunday when they drove 75 yards on 11 plays and got a 14-yard Breshad Perriman touchdown catch on their first possession. However, they never got back in the end zone again and they were bailed out by Tucker, who connected on field goals of 52, 57, 54 and 36 yards.
"You always have a lot of ups and downs, we just have to find some consistency," Perriman said.
That they haven't and the regular season is more than two thirds old has convinced many pundits that the Ravens won't be able to keep up with the Steelers in the division race.
"The kicker is the best player on the team, but you can't depend on your kicker to make 50-plus-yard field goals every week to win football games," NBC analyst and former NFL safety Rodney Harrison said on the "Football Night in America" pre-game show.
Tucker has accounted for 96 of the Ravens' 218 points, 44 percent.
"In this league … you can have a really good defense, but you have to be able to score," former NFL running back LaDainian Tomlinson said during NFL Network's Sunday programming. "At the end of the day, you have to score, and because the Ravens cannot score, and the Steelers can score, I give [Pittsburgh] the edge."
Despite the outside criticism and numbers that show the Ravens, in several areas, have been less productive offensively in six games with offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg calling the plays than in the first five games under the fired Marc Trestman, Harbaugh maintains there are improvements being made.
He pointed Monday to better play by the Ravens' offensive line over the past two weeks, and the team seemingly settling into a nice one-two combination on the ground with Terrance West (Northwestern High, Towson University) and rookie Kenneth Dixon. The two combined for 144 all-purpose yards against the Bengals.
Flacco and the rest of the offense have also had success the past three games when in a no-huddle offense. It's what got the offense going in the Nov. 10 victory over the Browns, and it also yielded encouraging results the past two weeks against the Cowboys and Bengals.
Leading the Bengals by 13 points at halftime, the Ravens went away from the no-huddle for stretches of the second half, and Flacco said later that he felt the offense lost its tempo and "got a little bit conservative." Harbaugh said Monday that the Ravens will continue to use the no-huddle, but cautioned that the team isn't built to use it exclusively.

Newcastle United transfer target Florian Thauvin is scheduled to fly to Tyneside tomorrow – according to reports in France.
A €17million deal is said to be on the table with Remy Cabella heading in the other direction on loan with a view to a permanent deal.
If talks go well with Thauvin the player could complete a medical and become the club's fifth summer signing. A six-year contract is thought to be up for grabs for Thauvin worth an estimated €3million.
Cabella has appeared 31 times for United but has been injured this summer and his efforts to impress Steve McClaren have been hampered by injury. Now he looks set to leave Newcastle, if French reports are correct.
Forward Thauvin, who has appeared for the France under-21 side, is a long-term target of Newcastle and has been linked with the club throughout the close season.

The World Junior Championships always start with a few exhibition games. Sweden first faced Canada on December 21st where they were outplayed in a 5-2 loss. Things didn't get any better for Tre Kronor as they were trounced 10-5 by the United States two days later.
However, when the round robin play started on Boxing Day, Sweden flipped a switch and has been perfect ever since. After winning all four preliminary games with a goal differential of +12, Sweden took care of heated rival Finland yesterday with an impressive 6-3 victory.
While William Nylander and Adriam Kempe (two Swedes who were taken in the 1st round in the 2014 draft) have been focal points for Sweden in this tournament, Oskar Lindblom has had a quiet, yet fantastic showing so far.
Through five games Lindblom has four goals (tied with Kempe) and nine points (tied with Nylander). He isn't the flashiest player on the ice and likely never will be, but he knows where to be at the right times and makes intelligent plays to get the puck in the net.
Leading up to the draft, Linblom started falling in many draft rankings. I spoke to Chris Pryor, Head Scout for the Philadelphia Flyers, after the 2014 draft and he mentioned that if the draft had been held the previous August or September, Lindblom “would've been picked in the 1st or 2nd round.”
The knock on Lindblom was his skating. While Swedes are known for their fluid movements and strides, Lindblom seemed to lack in that department. Mark Edwards of HockeyProspect.com said on Twitter:
Skating has always been the weakness for Lindblom. It gets exposed a bit more on the big ice. #WJC — Mark Edwards (@MarkEdwardsHP) January 2, 2015
Luckily for Lindblom he is playing on the smaller ice surface in Montreal/Toronto and will be doing so in the NHL as well. He's beginning to turn heads at the World Juniors with his consistent play and offensive skill. A meat-and-potatoes player, Lindblom has nine points in 17 SHL games this year. What he's learning playing against much older competition will be invaluable when he transitions to North America for good.
While in Flyers development camp Lindblom was one of the standout forwards all four days. Here were my thoughts on him after development camp wrapped up:
“Oskar Lindblom's camp has been very productive. He's been able to show just how essential he can be as a two-way forward. Strong puck pursuit, relentless on the forecheck, pokechecking, and being positionally sound are all skills that will take Lindblom to the next level. He was one of the better players during the scrimmage and scored a beautiful shootout goal.”
His game has grown leaps and bounds this season. Lindblom is capitalizing on his opportunity in the World Juniors and while it's still too early to label him a “steal” as a 5th rounder, it's a wonder how he fell so far on draft day.
Soaring home costs in North Texas have made it tougher for buyers to find properties priced under $200,000.
That's especially true in the new home market, where most houses are priced at more than $300,000.
But for buyers willing to drive a little farther and search out the right neighborhood, a handful of major builders are serving the first-time home market.
Centex Homes, D.R. Horton, LGI Homes and other builders still construct Dallas-Fort Worth area houses priced under $200,000.
“We're lucky we have home lots at a cost where we can afford to build at this price point,” said Centex sales manager Mike Goza, showing off the builder's new homes in Little Elm in Denton County.
Centex sells under $200,000 houses in a handful of North Texas communities. One of them is Paloma Creek off U.S. Highway 380.
The single-family homes start at about $175,000 for the basic model with around 1,600 square feet.
Mortgage payments on that price of house – financed for 30 years with 10 percent down – are about $840 a month. That doesn't include taxes and insurance costs.
“A lot of our buyers have been renting in Frisco or the Denton area,” Goza said. “And we do see some relocations coming to the area.
“We offer a great home at a good price point for first-time buyers,” he said. “People come in and are surprised all you get for under $200,000.”
Granite counter tops
The single-story, brick houses have a combined kitchen, dining and living area. Most of the houses have three bedrooms and two baths.
“We use granite counter tops in the kitchen, which is a big wow factor for first-time buyers,” Goza said. “Four of our seven floor plans in this community start under $200,000.”
Centex has sold out of its previous phases in the Little Elm subdivision and just added room for another 110 homes.
“It's getting more difficult to find a community under $200,000,” he said. “We typically sell these houses before they are finished.
“We have people coming in and looking for finished inventory, and we don't have any.”
Many buyers of lower cost houses start out shopping for pre-owned properties.
“That market is pretty constrained right, now and the prices are ratcheting up,” Goza said.
Median home sales prices for pre-owned property in North Texas have topped $200,000 for the first time.
And competition for affordable houses is so fierce that buyers end up competing for a property.
Outbid on pre-owned homes
Devin Connelly and his wife recently bought a house from Centex in Paloma Creek.
They shopped the pre-owned market first.
“A year prior to making the purchase, we were constantly outbid on existing homes even after offering more than the asking price,” Connelly said. “We like the home, and it seems to be very well built.
“Quite frankly, I'm surprised that they were able to finish building the house in time for us to move, given all the rain we were having in the area during that time.”
Bad weather earlier this year has put most D-FW homebuilders behind schedule.
And higher costs for building materials and land and labor shortages have caused new house prices to rise by more than 10 percent in 2015.
“That's our No. 1 issue the builders are facing – affordability and how to keep their prices down,” said Ted Wilson with Dallas housing analyst Residential Strategies Inc. “There are still some older building lots around that are priced lower, but those are going away.
“A new house for about $190,00 is pretty much the bottom rung in the market,” Wilson said. “It's getting very difficult for them to find a home lot priced under $40,000.”
Land costs up
Land and lot costs are one of the largest components of a new home's price.
Following the recession, many homebuilders abandoned the first-time home market because tougher lending standards reduced the number of buyers.
“The entry level was challenged because mortgage qualifications were so onerous,” Wilson said.
The number of first-time homebuyers in the market remains at a historic low.
Less than a third of U.S. home sales this year have been to first-time buyers – the lowest number in almost three decades, according to the National Association of Realtors.
And the median age of first-time buyers nationwide now tops 30.
With North Texas' population increasing at the highest volume of any U.S. market, economists say construction of more affordable housing is crucial.
“For years in Texas, we have had the most affordable housing for a major metro area,” said Dr. James Gaines, chief economist with the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. “Affordability and workforce housing are going to be a major issue.
“We are not building enough houses in the $150,000 to $200,000 bracket.”

Here's a lesson in online security: Passwords are important. They keep your information safe. Crucially, they also prevent other people from impersonating you.
Unfortunately, one of The Switch's readers learned that the hard way. On a story explaining how the Heartbleed bug could slow down the Internet, a commenter scoffed at the "Heartbleed thingamajig," arguing that the Internet's handwringing over security was mostly overwrought:
I couldn't give a flying fig about the Heartbleed thingamajig. Two years already the thing has been running loose ... and not a word of someone crying over its damage. Say ... does anyone really know its origin? Russian crackers? Seattle high-schoolers? the NSA? Yahoo's marketing department?
The reader went on to post the two passwords he uses on a regular basis across all of his main accounts, inviting hackers to
read all the eMail I have. Sneak into my WaPo, NYT or CNN accounts and go crazy making comments in my name. Break-into my Facebook or Twitter profiles and change my hometown to Gas City Indiana, swap-out my avatar with a picture of your nads, make friends with people I don't know.
Several other readers tried to point out how dangerous this was — to which the original commenter wrote, "Wow ... that's like attacking a brave guy 'cause he isn't foolish enough to be reckless."
Predictably, inviting the worst led to the worst.
The reader's accounts on Tumblr, WordPress, Twitter and Facebook all appear to have been hacked in short order. The reader's location on Twitter now reads as Gas City, Indiana, just like the commenter asked, and the account has several mocking tweets. I've obscured the reader's name here to protect his identity, even though he seems intent on getting it stolen.
"OK, Perhaps putting my password on a national news site is not so good," the commenter's WordPress blog reads. "I actually posted my password ... on a national news site, as well as bragging that my doors were open and I have no AV [antivirus] software. I see my Facebook was hit first, but perhaps I didn't think that if someone gets access to my email, they have access to my bank, credit cards, most anything. Ooops!" (Note: the WordPress post is written in the first-person voice, but from the context it sounds more like whomever hijacked the WordPress account was impersonating the reader.)
Now, there are other ways to explain what happened here. It's possible that this is a hoax — somebody set up fake accounts on these various services and deliberately hijacked them to manufacture a story from nothing. But the lesson is no less valid: Share your credentials online, and you won't have to worry about getting hacked — you'll have done all the hard work for the criminals.

TEHRAN, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that he will explain some points about the U.S. misconduct pertaining to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal in his UN speech, official IRNA news agency reported.
Rouhani left Tehran for New York on Sunday to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting, IRNA said.
During his trip, Rouhani will deliver a speech at the UN General Assembly and will urge the United States to abide by its commitments to the nuclear deal reached in 2015.
"Today, there is a consensus in the world that the JCPOA (or Iran's nuclear deal) benefits security, stability and development in the region and the world," he was quoted as saying by Press TV.
"The opponents of the JCPOA are restricted to two or three countries, including some in the United States, who feel cheated. They believe that a feast has been set out but that they are deprived of going to the table," Rouhani said.
He said that Iran has been committed to its obligations and this has been confirmed repeatedly by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog.
After years of tension with the West, Iran struck a deal with the world powers of Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany in July 2015, under which Iran agreed to limit its uranium-enrichment activities in return for the lifting of western and international sanctions.
The international agreement is facing a serious threat of collapse as tensions mounted between Washington and Tehran recently, the report said.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who during his election campaign had called the Iranian nuclear deal a "disaster" and "the worst deal ever negotiated," approved new sanctions on Tehran for its missile program.
Apart from the JCPOA, Rouhani will also talk about bilateral ties with world countries, regional issues as well as international developments including the ongoing crisis in Myanmar, according to the report.
On Sunday, Rouhani said regional issues have no military solutions, and there is need for political solutions with the participation of other countries.
He also pointed to terrorism as a major problem which all countries should join hands to eradicate in order to return peace and security to the world.

This is the first week for me developing the game. I'd probably put a lot of this progress on my enthusiastic outlook right now. But I'm taking care of all the background data related things to start.
What we have so far
If you haven't read the About the Game section, please do! It details my up to date progress and the general idea I have for this game.
Data Structures! We've got a bunch and they're all communicating properly at this point. The way I store all of the player information is what Game Maker calls ds_grids. If you have no experience with data structures, think of it like a battleship game board. You can store data in every point on the board. So I've created a grid for weapons, armor, and the heroes themselves.
Drawing everything! I am not going to be too anal about my artistic talent but I do need to have images to display to know things are functioning properly. At this point I'd like the functionality to grab a hero in the “Tavern” and display that hero in the “Guild”. So I need images such as armors, faces, legs, hair, etc. And the hair and faces are gender specific. In the end I may wind up commissioning the art, but that is a 90% completion sort of thought. A note on the faces though – with the sprites being so small I wound up drawing the faces at double the size and just scaling them down to fit in the details. I may consider this method going forward for armor, accessories, and weapons. Here's a gif up close and personal.
Images on images! I ran into a problem earlier this week where I didn't even think about layering the armor beneath the right arm. So I had to redraw the arm – dark and light skinned to be able to draw that image separately over the character. Now it looks smooth, but I'm fairly certain it's not efficient. Luckily there will only ever be 4 heroes on the screen drawing their layers at a time when in dungeons.
A pretty font. I went back to an old project and snagged some code to import a nicer font. Now it doesn't visually bother me to look at info.
What's Next
Tomorrow I will see what I can do with the Guild screen to be able to select heroes and gear them up. And just now I realized they also need individual inventories for items, so I'll figure that out too. Those two things are sort of complicated tasks though so I will most likely wind up stretching that out all week. Also – I may draw up some more armors and weapons when I only have a bit of time.
Thanks for reading! Keep up with my Twitter for updates and be sure to check on the About The Game page for up to date info on what's getting done!

When Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone at Mac World back in January 2007, he told the Apple faithful that his portable status symbol was backed by 200 patents. And the Apple faithful cheered. But that hasn't prevented an onslaught of iPhone-happy lawsuits.
After all, this is America.
Other patent holders have already sued Steve Jobs and company over the iPhone's touch screen, its virtual keyboard, and its so-called visual voicemail. And now an inventor named Romek Figa has gone after the handheld's caller ID feature, insisting it infringes a patent he bagged back in 1990.
Figa's patent, describes an "an automatic incoming telephone call number display system for detecting an incoming call and identifying the party associated with the incoming call number".
Like the iPhone, the system "includes a directory of telephone numbers and parties associated with those numbers," and it's equipped with "circuitry that detects the origin telephone number of an incoming telephone call and compares that number with numbers in the directory for identifying the calling party."
This patented system also includes a display that "permits the user to view the incoming call number and party associated with that number." It's worth noting, however, that this display differs from the iPhone's display:
Not an iPhone
Nonetheless, Figa's suit insists that "Apple has made or is making, has used or is using, has offered or is offering to sell, and/or has sold and is selling telephones which infringe" on his patent. In July, according to the suit, Figa asked Apple if they'd like to license the patent, but they said no. ®

By Matthew Goldstein and Jennifer Ablan and Philipp Halstrick
July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors and European regulators are close to arresting individual traders and charging them with colluding to manipulate global benchmark interest rates, according to people familiar with a sweeping investigation into the rigging scandal.
Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., have recently contacted lawyers representing some of the suspects to notify them that criminal charges and arrests could be imminent, said two of those sources, who asked not to be identified because the investigation is ongoing.
Defense lawyers, some of whom represent suspects, said prosecutors have indicated they plan to begin making arrests and filing criminal charges in the next few weeks. In long-running financial investigations it is not uncommon for prosecutors to contact defense lawyers before filing charges to offer suspects a chance to cooperate or take a plea, these lawyers said.
The prospect of charges and arrests means prosecutors are getting a fuller picture of how traders at major banks allegedly sought to influence the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, and other global rates that underpin hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets. The criminal charges would come alongside efforts by regulators to fine major banks, and could show that the alleged activity was not rampant at the lenders.
“The individual criminal charges have no impact on the regulatory moves against the banks,” said a European source familiar with the matter. “But banks are hoping that at least regulators will see that the scandal was mainly due to individual misbehavior of a gang of traders.”
In Europe, financial regulators are focusing on a ring of traders from several European banks who allegedly sought to rig benchmark interest rates such as Libor, said the European source familiar with the investigation in Europe.
The source, who did not want to be identified because the investigation is ongoing, said regulators are checking emails among a group of traders and believe they are close to piecing together a picture of how the suspects allegedly conspired to make money by manipulating rates. The rates are set daily based on an average of estimates supplied by a panel of banks.
“More than a handful of traders at different banks are involved,” said the source familiar with the investigation by European regulators.
There are also probes in Europe concerning Euribor, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate.
It is not clear on which individuals and banks federal prosecutors are most focused. A top U.S. Department of Justice lawyer overseeing the investigation did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters previously reported that more than a dozen current and former employees of several large banks are under investigation, including Barclays Plc (BARC.L), UBS UBSN.VX and Citigroup (C.N), and have hired defense lawyers over the past year as a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., continues to gather evidence.
Activity in the Libor investigation, which has been going on for three years, has quickened since Barclays agreed last month to pay $453 million in fines and penalties to settle allegations with regulators and prosecutors that some of its employees tried to manipulate key interest rates from 2005 through 2009.
Barclays, which signed a non-prosecution agreement with U.S. prosecutors, is the first major bank to reach a settlement in the investigation, which also is looking at the activities of employees at HSBC (HSBA.L), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and other major lenders.
HSBC declined to comment. Officials at Citigroup and UBS were not available for comment.
The Barclays settlement sparked outrage and a series of public hearings in Britain, after which Barclays Chief Executive Bob Diamond announced his resignation from the UK bank.
The revelations have raised questions about the integrity of Libor, which is used as a benchmark in setting prices for loans, mortgages and derivative contracts.
Adding to concerns are documents released by the New York Federal Reserve Bank this month that show regulators in the United States and England had some knowledge that bankers were submitting misleading Libor bids during the 2008 financial crisis to make their financial institutions appear stronger than they really were.
Among other details, the Fed documents included the transcript of an April 2008 telephone call between a Barclays trader in New York and Fed official Fabiola Ravazzolo, in which the unidentified trader said: “So, we know that we're not posting um, an honest Libor.”
The source familiar with the investigation in Europe said two traders suspended from Deutsche Bank were among those being investigated. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment.
The Financial Times said on Wednesday that regulators were looking at suspected communication among four traders who had worked at Barclays, Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA), HSBC and Deutsche Bank.
Credit Agricole said it had not been accused of any wrongdoing related to the attempted manipulation of Libor by Barclays, but had responded to requests for information from various authorities related to the matter.
Beyond regulatory penalties and criminal charges, banks face a growing number of civil lawsuits from cities, companies and financial institutions claiming they were harmed by rate manipulation. Morgan Stanley recently estimated that the 11 global banks linked to the Libor scandal may face $14 billion in regulatory and legal settlement costs through 2014.
In the United States, the regulatory investigation is being led by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has made the Libor probe one of its top priorities.

Cpl. Ron Francis's lifelong friend and lawyer is making a plea for help for police officers and other first responders who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, in the wake of the suicide of the RCMP veteran, known for his stand on smoking medicinal marijuana while in uniform.
RCMP Cpl. Ron Francis committed suicide Monday amid legal troubles that started when he was asked to turn in his uniform after he was found smoking medical marijuana on the job. (Joe McDonald/CBC) Francis, a 21-year Mountie veteran who was on medical leave from J Division in New Brunswick, died around 4 p.m. Monday. He was 43.
"He ended up unfortunately falling ill to the post-traumatic stress, and the treatment that he should have received just wasn't there for him at the end," said T.J. Burke.
Burke is calling on the provincial and federal governments to develop something to help first responders "receive actual treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder."
The RCMP have had 16 documented incidents of suicide among serving members over the past nine years, and 15 suicides among retired members.
Those figures do not include Francis's death, "as it is up to the coroner to determine the cause," communications officer Sgt. Greg Cox stated in an email.
It's unclear how many of those suicides may be related to PTSD.
Marijuana a 'red herring'
Francis made national headlines in late 2013 when he went public with his belief he should be allowed to smoke medical marijuana while in uniform to help him cope with PTSD.
In recent months, Burke has also represented a Fredericton city police officer and an ex-member of the Canadian military who have been charged with crimes while, Burke says, they were dealing with PTSD.
​"We're seeing people, first responders — EMTs, police officers, soldiers, firefighters — coming forward saying they have post-traumatic stress disorder," said Burke.
Lawyer T.J. Burke, a lifelong friend of Ron Francis, says more needs to be done to help first responders dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder. (CBC) "What's happening is it's manifesting in such a way because they are not receiving treatment, they are committing what society calls criminal acts. We're seeing them in court cases."
While Francis gained national notoriety in his quest to be allowed to smoke prescribed marijuana while on the job, Burke says that was never the major issue at play.
"Ronnie's whole goal was never smoking marijuana," said Burke. "It was about bringing to light that the RCMP was not providing adequate services to its officers that suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
The marijuana was always a red herring. It was always the issue concerning post-traumatic stress disorder. - T.J. Burke, lawyer and lifelong friend of Ron Francis
"The marijuana was always a red herring," he said. "It was always the issue concerning post-traumatic stress disorder.
"For 21 years, he served as a proud member of the RCMP," said Burke. "He had no disciplinary issues.
"What the public saw was a man who was very sick in his last year of life and that is the unfortunate thing," said Burke.
"He was more than a person who smoked marijuana in uniform."
RCMP call death 'a terrible loss'
Assistant commissioner Roger Brown, the RCMP's commanding officer for J Division in New Brunswick, confirmed Francis's death Tuesday "with great sadness."
"I know there will be much speculation about why this happened and assumptions may be made," said Brown. "The RCMP had been working with Ron to do everything we could to get him the support he had asked for and needed."
Brown said the RCMP were dealing with Francis as recently as Sunday to try to provide assistance to him. Francis had been on extended medical leave.
"Cpl. Francis was a very proud member of the RCMP for almost 22 years and will no doubt be missed," said Brown in a voice shaky with emotion.
"He helped shine a light on post-traumatic stress disorder affecting emergency first responders," he said. "Mental illness, as you well know, is something that carries a stigma and it is important as a society that we not only continue to talk about this very real issue, but we work together to find ways to address it.
"This is a terrible loss for the RCMP family and the community."
Brown said the issue of PTSD for first responders "is real."
This was a cry for help and a need to raise the awareness as to what PTSD really is within the organizations we all work for. - Roger Brown, assistant commissioner RCMP J Division
"It's unfortunate that the incidents that became very public to his own doing, that's only a very, very small snippet of who he was and what he actually did.
"This wasn't a pot-smoking issue. This wasn't a red serge issue. This wasn't a uniform issue," said Brown.
"This was a cry for help and a need to raise the awareness as to what PTSD really is within the organizations we all work for."
Brown said he is confident the RCMP did everything it could do to reach out and respond to Francis and provide him with the support he needed.
"Unfortunately, the turn of events yesterday really brings this into focus with respect to how much an issue this really is."
Francis case was before the courts
In September, Francis was set to stand trial on six counts arising from incidents in December 2013 and January 2014 when he changed his plea to guilty on three of the charges.
Francis pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting fellow officers and one count of breaching an undertaking to not possess or consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs.
The three other charges were withdrawn.
Just before he entered the guilty pleas on Sept. 3, Francis told reporters: "I'm hoping what I've been through will help others. But right now, I'm the one who is sort of in crisis."
A sentencing hearing had been scheduled for Nov. 3.
The charges came out of a confrontation with fellow RCMP officers and Fredericton police on Dec. 6, 2013, when Francis was arrested on a mental-health warning.
The incident came one week after Francis turned in his ceremonial red serge to the RCMP after making national news with his assertion he should be allowed to smoke prescribed medicinal marijuana to deal with his PTSD.
The RCMP stripped Francis of his uniform and placed him on medical leave in November 2013.
Francis said the national police force needs to change its policies and provide more resources to officers.
In January 2013, the RCMP offered to pay for Francis to attend a treatment facility in Powell River, B.C. for three months. Francis left the facility after three days, saying he couldn't get settled and felt like he was being watched.
Francis was Maliseet and a member of Kingsclear First Nation, near Fredericton. In his most recent court appearance, and when he turned in his red serge to the RCMP, he carried with him an eagle feather.
The close-knit First Nations community asked to be left alone on Tuesday to grieve, but Chief Gabriel Atwin issued a written statement, describing Francis as a "man of honour and service.
"Most importantly, to the youth in our community, Ron was a role model. He proved that it was not impossible to rise above the challenges and roadblocks that face our youth," Atwin said.
"The depth of the loss we feel only proves that a life of service to one's community earns the respect of all."
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tony Blair: "If Europe moves forward again then Britain's going to have some very interesting choices"
Tony Blair has said the UK will face an "interesting choice" over whether to join the euro if the currency's current crisis is resolved.
The former prime minister told the BBC he believed the UK should still be keeping open the option of joining it.
He said that looking at the "broad sweep of history" in the long term "the European integration project" was going to go ahead, "like it or not".
The UK, as a "small island nation", had to be part of it to have influence.
Mr Blair said that the only thing that would save the single currency now was to have a "grand plan" where Germany was ready to commit its economy fully - "treating the debts of one as the debts of all".
This would be difficult for Germany, he said, and would have to be in return for other countries having "precise, deliverable" programmes of change and reform that could restore European competitiveness.
As well as economic changes, political change was also inevitable with Europe needing reform of labour markets, pensions, welfare, public services the role of the state, he said.
He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that his former chancellor Gordon Brown had "always been right" on the economic case against the UK joining the euro when Labour was in power.
'Arab revolution'
But Mr Blair said he had always believed that it was important to be supportive of the project politically so the UK could join when the conditions were right "and I still think that's the case".
Asked if that meant he still thought the UK should join the euro one day he said: "Look, if they sort it all out and Europe moves forward again then Britain's going to have a very interesting choice in the future."
Mr Blair, who was prime minister from 1997 to 2007, told the same programme that he was still interested in public service and would have been happy to have remained as prime minister, or to have got the job of European president.
On the recent controversy of tax avoidance schemes, Mr Blair said he thought the mood had changed, saying that in tough times people wanted to know everyone was paying their fair share.
Mr Blair, who said he had made 86 trips to the Middle East since leaving office, said he believed that the Arab Spring was actually an "Arab revolution" and "would sweep across the whole region and beyond".
He said the bad news was that in the short term there would be pain for people in the Middle East as they attempted to develop democracy after the overthrow of dictators, but in the long term it would be good news because it showed people wanted freedom.
The former PM also said there was nothing new in the suggestion, in Sunday's Independent, that he had stopped the attorney general telling the cabinet the full detail of the legal concerns ahead of the Iraq war in 2003.
"No, it's absolutely not true... the notion that Cabinet never discussed this issue is absurd... there is no great hidden conspiracy about this, it was a decision (to go to war). Now some people agree with it, some people disagree with it," he said.
He added that when people "looked at the Middle East today" he thought that in the "broad sweep of history, people will take a different view of it".
A 57-year-old man who immigrated to Canada as a baby is on the verge of being deported from the only country he's known because of a string of crimes triggered by severe mental illness.
Len Van Heest — diagnosed with bipolar disorder in British Columbia at age 16 — is just the latest, dramatic example of a growing trend, say some immigration lawyers.
Increasing numbers of adult immigrants who came here as small children and developed psychiatric or neurological conditions now face removal after the previous government toughened the law on non-citizen criminals, they say.
The Canada Border Services Agency detained Len Van Heest last Wednesday and plans to send him to the Netherlands, though he doesn't speak Dutch and has not lived there since he was in diapers.
We're just dumping someone in another country
The Vancouver Island man neglected to become a Canadian citizen, so falls under legislation that lets the government expel immigrants who commit serious crimes.
A Federal Court judge has just upheld the denial of Van Heest's application to remain on humanitarian and compassionate grounds — and rejected his claim that deportation to the Netherlands would be cruel and unusual punishment.
“I don't think it's fair at all,” said Peter Golden, his Victoria-based lawyer. “I don't think we can treat someone who has these vulnerabilities just like we treat everybody else …We're just dumping someone in another country.”
Golden said he is worried that his client will end up on the streets in Holland, without his required drug treatment. “In all probability, it's a death sentence for him.”
Van Heest is now planning a last-ditch application to the new Immigration minister, John McCallum, for a permanent stay of deportation, said his lawyer.
But a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency said the decision to remove someone from Canada “is not taken lightly,” and that various avenues of appeal are open to those facing deportation.
Van Heest was twice given a reprieve from removal, only to relapse into criminal activity, noted another immigration lawyer.
“I think in this particular case, as the court notes, there were just too many strikes against this fellow,” said Sergio Karas, vice-chair of the Ontario Bar Association's immigration section. What's more, “in the Netherlands, you're going to get perhaps even better (mental-health) support than here.”
There were just too many strikes against this fellow
Still, the United Nations' human-rights committee criticized Canada earlier this year for another, similar decision: the 2011 deportation of a 52-year-old Jamaican man who had immigrated as a teenager and committed crimes related to his schizophrenia.
Since the Conservatives tightened the law in 2013, lawyers are seeing more such removal cases, “where people came to Canada as children and developed either mental illness or brain injury due to an accident,” Golden said.
The deportation rule now kicks in with a sentence of six months or more — down from two years — and there is no longer a right to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division.
“Across the board, immigration lawyers would say they have been seeing more of these cases,” echoed Jennifer Stone, a lawyer at Neighbourhood Legal Services in Toronto. “This fact scenario is one that I see somewhat commonly, and it's a real problem.”
But Karas said the six-month rule makes sense, since under the old law many judges were imposing sentences of just below two years solely to avoid deportation.
According to the Federal Court ruling earlier this month, Van Heest arrived in Canada at eight months old and was a teenager when diagnosed with bipolar — where altered brain function triggers occasionally severe and disabling mood swings.
The disease causes manic episodes where he becomes agitated and hostile, harming himself and others, said Justice George Locke. He has a lengthy criminal record — usually racked up when he goes off his treatment — with about 32 police reports filed just in 2012.
Van Heest was first ordered removed from Canada in 2008, but twice won stays on deportation, and each time breached the conditions by getting in more trouble with the law, said the decision. Most recently, he was charged with uttering a threat and possession of a dangerous weapon — which Golden said was a kitchen knife.
He applied for reinstatement of his permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, but an immigration officer rejected the request.
Golden says his client is tall, burly and bearded — making him look somewhat threatening — but he has never done serious harm to anyone.
Justice Locke — who could only review whether the immigration officer's decision was reasonable, not retry the case — cited evidence from a Dutch psychiatrist that as a citizen of Holland, Van Heest would receive treatment there, and that most Dutch people speak at least some English.

Server.js 1.0 released — for Node.js 8 LTS
Francisco Presencia Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 1, 2017
One year ago I had a problem and I decided to solve it. I was teaching Node.js in a workshop with Hacker Paradise and I got to the point where I normally say:
This code is too complex to explain at this point, so let's just copy/paste it and continue.
That part was when adding all of the middleware to make Express have bodyparser, sessions, cookies, etc. I thought it'd be really nice to have this set of basic functionality working for everyone by default.
Now with server I'd do this and have a fully working website:
const server = require('server');
const { get, post } = server.router;
server(
get(ctx => 'Hello world'),
post(ctx => console.log(ctx.data))
);
Modern javascript
Another thing that I didn't like about Node.js programming is Callback Hell. With Await/Async this is easily solved. Let's say a simple scrapper that saves the links of the passed url into a database and replies to it:
const server = require('server');
const { get, post } = server.router;
const { render, json } = server.reply;
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
// Up to you how to implement these (Cheerio + MongoDB?)
const scrapeLinks = require('./fetch-links');
const saveLinks = require('./save-links');
server(
get(ctx => render('index.jade')),
post(async ctx => {
const saved = await Links.find({ url: ctx.data }).exec();
if (saved.length) return json(saved);
const body = await fetch(ctx.data).then(res => res.text());
const links = scrapeLinks(body);
await saveLinks(ctx.data.url, links);
return json(links);
})
);
That's the main logic for it. Quite intuitive and direct compared to the callback way. Async/await are truly awesome.
Achievements
These are the things I am most proud of, from a personal point of view and for the project itself.
I could make the library that I enjoy and use for my personal projects. It is easy and intuitive. I found many bugs and edge cases from daily use and would love that you report any bug that you might find.
While neither of them officially released, it has great socket.io integration and a powerful plugin system. That is on top of being backwards-compatible with any Express middleware that you can find, a big win IMO.
The Documentation has seen a lot of care and hard work. I will do my best to separate it into a different module in the future to be able to redistribute it and use on other projects. Want some nice docs like those? Hire me.
Things I'd change
Make it sooner! I didn't expect it to take a full year. I knew it was a longer project, but I expected to release it 3–6 months ago. The two main reasons are life, which got in the way, and me trying to make it future-proof.
Get more people using it sooner. When I teach web programming to friends I still follow express route. However I know that if I am spending my time teaching friends and acquaintances they won't care or they'd even be happy to give me a hand on this.
Next steps
First to take a small break. If it becomes popular it's probably going to be short, but I'd like to explore some other areas for a bit.
Then, the main priority is expanding the documentation and tutorials. This is a lot of work but IMO one of the best return of investment for any library. If they cannot find it, it doesn't exist kind of thing.
Finally, make a plan and look forward for the 1.1. This will include official socket.io and the full plugin system. Also, some pre-made plugins such as an auth one, sass, react, etc.
Looking for Sponsors
I'm also looking for sponsors for the project. It doesn't get many visits but surprisingly it gets a decent and steadily growing number of installs. So this looks like a small but passionate userbase, feel free to sponsor the project: Sponsor website.
Please let me know what what you create:

Canadians put a lot of faith in scientific experts, and most have at least some trust in things like the CBC, the news media, and the federal government, according to a new survey conducted by Campaign Research.
However, it found those identifying as Conservatives were less trusting of all these institutions.
Results shared exclusively with The Hill Times show that scientific experts were the most trusted among respondents to a survey done between March 5 and 7, with 83 per cent of those polled saying they had at least some trust in them, and 37 per cent reporting they had a “great deal of trust” in them.
The second most trustworthy institution, among the seven evaluated, was the CBC, which 71 per cent said was trustworthy and 25 per cent said they placed a great deal of trust in.
News media were seen as trustworthy by 63 per cent of respondents, with 14 per cent saying they put a lot of trust in the news. It was followed by the federal government, which was trusted by 56 per cent of respondents, and very much so by 12 per cent.
The internet was trusted by 53 per cent of survey-takers and considered very trustworthy by seven per cent.
The remaining two categories—political polls and big business—were rated trustworthy by fewer than half of those asked. Political polls had the trust of 45 per cent, and a lot of trust from five per cent. Big business had at least some trust from 39 per cent, and great deal of trust from five per cent.
Conservatives were less trusting of most categories, though pretty well in line with the average on the internet and even more likely to trust big business, with 45 per cent indicating at least a little trust in this sector. Just 33 per cent of Conservatives in this poll expressed any trust in the federal government, 50 per cent trusted news media, 53 per cent trusted the CBC, 42 per cent trusted political polls, and 76 per cent trusted scientific experts.
“In general, everyone trusts scientific experts (Conservatives slightly less so), but it may be surprising to see Canadians have a high degree of trust in the media in general and CBC specifically. Although, once again, this trust is not shared by Conservatives,” Campaign Research CEO Eli Yufest said in a press release.
Liberals, on the other hand, were notably more trusting of the federal government than average, with 78 per cent expressing some level of trust here. Liberals were also more trusting of political polls (54 per cent) and the internet (57 per cent).
NDP supporters were noted for their low level of trust (27 per cent) in big business.
The figures were based on interactive-voice-response surveys by phone with 798 people and online surveys of another 1,088 selected from a panel, for a total sample of 1,886. Campaign Research said the margin of error would have been three percentage points, 19 times out of 20, if the whole sample was randomly selected.

The 14-year-old boy arrived at Sycamore Middle School Wednesday morning ready to carry out a deadly plan.
But there was one person he knew could talk him out of it, according to police. So after his first-period class at the school in Ashland, Tenn., he went to see her.
Molly Hudgens, the school counselor, took the boy into her office and immediately sensed something was wrong. He asked some questions Hudgens found alarming and told the counselor he was having “issues,” police said.
Do you have a gun? Hudgens asked.
Yes, he said, and showed her the loaded .45 caliber pistol tucked under his clothes. He told her he wanted to kill teachers and a police officer, The Tennessean reported.
Just hours later, on Wednesday afternoon, a different 14-year-old boy in South Carolina would open fire on an elementary school playground, injuring two children and an adult.
But Sycamore Middle School avoided such tragedy. After a 45-minute conversation in her office, Hudgens persuaded the teen to give up his gun, Cheatham County Sheriff Mike Breedlove said Wednesday.
“She did something even the most experienced law enforcement officer might not do,” Breedlove said. “Had she not been there, it could have been very different.”
The boy, who has not been identified, was arrested and charged with possession of a weapon on school grounds and threatening employees. He is being held in a county jail pending his next hearing.
What happened at Sycamore is rare. In most school shootings in recent memory, gunmen have attacked without clear forewarning, and guidance counselors, friends or family members are seldom given a chance to step in and stop them. In Wednesday's shooting in South Carolina, authorities say the gunman killed his father before opening fire at the school.
People in the community have hailed Hudgens as a hero.
Awesome School Counselor and Friend….Molly Hudgens Huge THANKS for what you do!! #HomeTownHero https://t.co/uyD2ce7Vuc — Serena Collingsworth (@Sissy33Rocks) September 30, 2016

Hudgens, who said she's been with Sycamore for almost 19 years, wasn't available for comment Thursday night. But in a video statement released by the Cheatham County School District, she called the boy a “student in need” and said that her training in deescalation helped her persuade him to hand over the weapon. She said the boy didn't name any specific students or teachers as targets.
“Sycamore Middle School is safe,” she said. “I'm proud of the actions of our faculty, staff and students … in maintaining an atmosphere of calm.”
In a news conference Wednesday, Breedlove said the boy brought the gun from home but he declined to comment on what problems prompted him to take it to school. During the conversation in her office, he said, Hudgens tried to discreetly text security to let them know about the situation, but she couldn't get a clear signal from inside the room. When she did notify police, Sycamore Middle School and a neighboring high school were placed on lockdown. Breedlove said the gun never left her office until police arrived.
“It was Ms. Hudgens that defused the whole situation,” he said. “She had a lot on her shoulders.”

On her school profile page, Hudgens says she started working at Sycamore in 1999 and joined the counseling department in 2006. She says in her bio that she hopes students find the counseling department to be a “warm environment” where they can go for “advice, direction, and encouragement.”
Jessica Williams, a friend of Hudgens, told the Associated Press that she wasn't surprised by Hudgens's actions Wednesday.
“She's the type of person that would be easy for her to get through to somebody,” Williams said. “She's a very loving, caring, motherly personality.”
Prince Harry took his Antarctic mission training to the next level last night (17 Sept.) as he endured a night of freezing temperatures and fast winds, similar to the ones he will soon me facing on a daily basis, by spending the night in a freezer. The prince and his crew of wounded former-servicemen from across the Commonwealth climbed into the industrial freezer space in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, in order to acclimatise themselves for the harsh Antarctic weather.
Prince Harry and Alexander Skarsgard will face-off in a race to the South Pole
Both Harry and Swedish-born Alexander, who will be racing against the Prince and his Commonwealth teammates as part of a crew representing the US, will race for 200 miles through one of the harshest environments on Earth and used the facility, which normally tests the durability of vehicles, to test themselves. According to the BBC, they were subjected to temperatures of -35C and wind speeds of 45 mph in the Nuneaton testing centre, as they prepared themselves for conditions that could be much worse when they are down in the icy tundra.
In the weather chamber, the crew completed various exercises and training routines that they would have to undertake whilst in the harst conditions of the Antarctic, such as putting up tents and warming themselves up through riding bikes and using cross-trainers. And following their first attempt, team-member Major Kate Philp agreed that the prince will make a good companion. She said, "He knows what he's doing. He's got his military training... so he's a good extra pair of hands."
Harry's military training will come in handy on the expedition
Someone who isn't quite as confident for Harry's team however is Skarsgard, who reckons the US team will ease to victory against the royal and his crew. He told People recently that he still hasn't met Harry, but he plans on doing so at the finish line. He said, "I'm pretty stubborn and motivated and I don't give up easily," adding, "I'm very excited to meet him. I'll be with my U.S. teammates at the South Pole welcoming him. I'll be happy to see him when he arrives. We will be there first though!"
Jolly's win has many Democrats worried about how to talk about Obamacare. Fla. loss exposes Dem ACA disarray
Democrats can't even agree whether Obamacare was the reason for their crushing loss in a Florida special election Tuesday.
Now picture how their messaging plan for the health care law is shaping up for 2014.
Story Continued Below
Republican lobbyist David Jolly's victory over Democrat Alex Sink has many Democrats privately worried and publicly split about how to talk about Obamacare.
( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)
A few Democrats are advocating a drastic rhetorical shift to the left, by criticizing their own party for not going far enough when it passed the law in 2010.
Other Democrats plan to sharply criticize the Affordable Care Act when running for re-election.
Many plan to stick to the simple message that Obamacare is flawed and needs to be fixed —a tactic that plainly didn't work for Sink.
Taken together, the Democratic Party is heading into an already tough election year divided — instead of united — on the very issue Republicans plan to make central to their campaigns.
( Also on POLITICO: Administration: 4.2 million people signed up for Obamacare plans)
The political tug of Obamacare is neatly encapsulated by Rep. Ron Barber, a Democrat who holds a Tucson, Ariz., area seat. Barber said he's uncomfortable with his party's health care message, and added that you “can't, with a straight face, stand up and say this is a perfect bill.” He wishes Democrats would “be willing to be honest about this legislation and to be willing to point out, and not be defensive, and say what's good about it and say what we are willing to change.
But illustrating the tension, Martha McSally, Barber's opponent, appeared at a closed House Republican Conference meeting Wednesday, saying she's “on offense” against Obamacare, and the Florida results prove her race is winnable.
Vulnerable members of the president's party appeared to run from questions about it Wednesday.
( Also on POLITICO: Who says lobbyists can't win?)
Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) — one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents — twice waved off a reporter's questions. Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), who will likely face GOP Rep. Cory Gardner in November, said he would prefer to answer a reporter's question by phone to offer a “coherent” response. But his aides did not later make him available for an interview.
Democrats are concerned the health care law's approval ratings won't rebound by the time voters go to the polls in November. Even more significantly, they fear the law's unpopularity — along with President Barack Obama's flagging approval ratings — could keep Democrats home in November, according to conversations with several top lawmakers and aides.
Republicans seem to think they've struck political gold, but Democrats aren't even sure how to interpret the loss. A veteran Democratic fundraiser called the loss a “double whammy,” hurting the party with major donors and energizing Republicans. Some senior members of the party say the defeat in a district President Barack Obama won twice means nothing, and Democrats should not fret. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who is likely to have a tight race in November, attributed Sink's defeat to flood insurance legislation, which played a minor role compared to Jolly's nearly singular focus on the health care law.
( Florida special election results)
This all comes as Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for a brutal battle for control of Congress this fall. Jolly's victory over Sink, while not a definitive measure of the political climate, is not a good sign for Obama's party as voters head to the ballot box in less than eight months. Republicans are expected to make some gains in the midterms, but the results in Florida show Democrats could be facing stiffer headwinds than they thought in protecting their five-seat majority in the Senate and chipping away at Republican control of the House.
“Every off-year election, with the exception of two in our history, has been rough on the president's party. And last night in Florida was no exception,” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who is expected to cruise to victory in his reelection bid this November. “Republicans have decided there's only one issue. I think they're wrong — I think they're going to find that horse won't cross the finish line.”

WOODSTOCK, Alabama - Ms. Redneck Alabama was not your average kind of pageant.
Instead of dresses, contestants showed off cowboy boots and Daisy Dukes. Instead of singing "The Star-Spangled Banner," some of them sang "Country Girl (Shake It for Me)" by Luke Bryan or "Gunpowder and Lead" by Miranda Lambert.
More than 100 people turned out for the event Saturday at the Woodstock Festival Art Center. The event was the first of its kind to be held there, said Shelia Gunter, who helped organize it. The center normally hosts bands and other local artists.
"It's very unusual, very unique," Gunter said. "It's Cracker Barrel meets Hard Rock Cafe."
Seven women vied for the title of Ms. Redneck Alabama, with Katrina Hogg of West Blocton coming out in first place. She received $100 in cash, several gift cards and the coveted title. Rachel Musso of Bessemer and Alana Thomas of West Blocton won first- and second- runner-up, respectively.
Contestants were judged in three categories: Answering a redneck-themed question, talent and Daisy Dukes (poise and personality).
The second segment was redneck talent. In an effort to out-redneck one other, contestants sang country music, danced to country music and funneled soft drinks. Musso sang "Redneck Woman" by Gretchen Wilson while making a baloney sandwich.
Four judges selected the winners. Musso and Hogg tied, prompting the hosts to challenge them to name as many country artists as they could in 30 seconds.
They tied again. Finally, the winner was chosen by how loud the crowd cheered for each one, with Hogg coming out in first place.
"I was really nervous before it started but then once I got up there and saw everybody, I was like, 'Okay that's not so bad,'" said Musso. "And then after I sang my song, I felt really confident. We all did good. I really feel like I had a good time."
"I've never had so much fun in my life," said Hogg on winning the pageant. "I was very excited, very happy."
Local southern rocker Richard Otinger hosted the pageant, and he and his band, Richard Otinger and the Buck Wild Band, was the night's entertainment. The band performed after the pageant to a cheering crowd.

A prayerful Indiana public school coach was given a talking to, following Freedom From Religion Foundation complaint.
The girls' tennis coach at Bellmont High School in Decatur, Ind., led members of his team and their families in a Christian prayer at the last match of the year.
FFRF pointed out to school officials that it is illegal for public school coaches to guide their teams in prayer.
"The U.S. Supreme Court has continually struck down school-sponsored prayer in public schools," FFRF Legal Fellow Ryan Jayne wrote to North Adams Community Schools Superintendent Brent Lehman. "The coach's conduct is unconstitutional because he endorses and promotes his personal religion when acting in his official capacity as a school district employee. Therefore, he may not lead his team in prayer and he may not organize or advocate for students to pray."
The school district got the message.
"I have investigated your report of June 16, 2016," Lehman replied in a letter. "The athletic director met with the coach about the allegedly improper behavior. The coach was reminded about rules and he expressed his intent to follow these rules in the future. The athletic director intends to issue a reminder to the entire coaching staff when school resumes this fall about such matters."
FFRF is pleased at the swift reaction.
"Public school coaches have a responsibility to follow constitutional limitations placed against proselytizing a captive audience of students," says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation is a national organization dedicated to the separation of state and church, with nearly 24,000 nonreligious members nationwide, including more than 300 in Indiana.
Mississippi Officer Had Unblemished Record
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: (212) 549-2666; media@aclu.org
HATTIESBURG, MS – The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit today on behalf of Andre Cooley, a corrections officer for juvenile detainees with an exemplary record who was fired when his supervisors discovered that he was gay. The lawsuit claims that Cooley's constitutional rights were violated by the Forrest County Sheriff's Department and his superior officers.
"Andre's sexual orientation has no bearing on his ability to perform the job of a corrections officer," said Joshua Block, staff attorney with the ACLU Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Project. "It is well established that a public employer cannot fire an employee based on irrational fears and prejudices against gay people. But Andre's case is also a reminder that people in Mississippi who work for private companies are left almost entirely unprotected from anti-gay discrimination. There is currently no state or federal law protecting against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."
On June 14, while at home and off-duty, Cooley called 911 after his boyfriend became physically violent. Among the officers who responded to the call was Chief of Corrections Charles Bolton, one of Cooley's supervisors. After Cooley's boyfriend told Bolton that he and Cooley were in a relationship, Bolton told Cooley not to return to work before speaking with his immediate supervisor. The next day, Staff Sergeant of Jail Operations Donnell Brannon informed Cooley that he was being permanently terminated. Cooley asked Brannon if he was being fired because he was gay, and Brannon responded, "Yes."
Cooley has never received a written explanation for his firing. He has never been charged or disciplined in connection with the domestic violence precipitated by his former boyfriend the day before he was fired. The official police report of the incident identifies Cooley as the victim. After firing Cooley, the sheriff's department attempted to deny him unemployment benefits by alleging that Cooley had engaged in unspecified "inappropriate conduct and behavior while off duty, unacceptable for an officer." But after a hearing, an administrative law judge concluded that the sheriff's department failed to show that Cooley committed misconduct of any kind.
Cooley was raised in the foster care system from birth. He chose to be a corrections officer so he could serve as a mentor and positive role model for troubled teenagers. Cooley earned his bachelor's degree in administration of justice from the University of Southern Mississippi, and began working for the Forrest County Sheriff's Department in November 2009 where he was quickly promoted to senior corrections officer. At the time Cooley was hired, he was told that he had a better resume than any other person who had applied for the job.
"I loved my job, and I did it well. It shouldn't matter whether I'm gay or straight," said Cooley. "Because I grew up in the foster care system, I know the types of problems faced by the kids in juvenile corrections. As a corrections officer I could give back by helping these kids turn their lives around and build a future for themselves."
"It is shameful and baffling that the sheriff's department would terminate Andre for being gay," said Bear Atwood of the ACLU of Mississippi. "Andre's life is a perfect example of what a person can accomplish through hard work and education. As a juvenile corrections officer, he was a positive role model for kids who were falling through the cracks and had no one else they could relate to."
The lawsuit names the Forrest County Sheriff's Department, Chief Bolton, Sheriff Billy McGee and Staff Sergeant Brannon for violating his equal protection and due process rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Cooley is represented by Joshua Block and Leslie Cooper at the ACLU Foundation, Bear Atwood at the ACLU of Mississippi and Lisa E. Cleary and Aron Fischer at the law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP.

Data released Tuesday from the Colorado Department of Transportation suggests traffic deaths have increased 24 percent since 2014.
In 2016, there were 605 traffic fatalities in Colorado, compared to 547 fatalities in 2015.
The last time fatalities registered over 600 was in 2005 when 606 deaths were recorded.
RELATED: CDOT wants Colorado to have a primary seat belt law
RELATED: New strategies to reduce fatal crashes
“Colorado is growing, but that doesn't mean traffic fatalities must grow too,” CDOT Executive Director Shailen Bhatt said. “A lot can be done to mitigate the increase; for example, if everyone buckled up we could save over 60 lives per year.”
CDOT says unbelted occupants accounted for half of the passenger vehicle fatalities in 2016.
Odds of surviving a crash improve immensely if motorists buckle up, watch their speed, avoid mixing driving with drugs or alcohol, and stay off their phones, CDOT said.
CODT officials hold a press conference to discuss uptick in traffic fatalities.
Motorcycle fatalities hit an all-time record high of 125 deaths in 2016 -- a 50 percent increase from 2012 when 79 deaths were recorded. CDOT says most of these motorcyclists were not wearing helmets.
From 2002 to 2014, traffic-related fatalities in Colorado dropped 34 percent. This happened despite the growth in the state with new residents, businesses and visitors.

There is a glaring miscommunication happening right now between whites and blacks and it stems from an unclear definition of the term "white privilege." Let's be perfectly clear: If you are white, you have white privilege — period.
Having white privilege does not mean you have an easy life. It means that when a figure of authority confronts you, because your skin is white, you automatically get the benefit of the doubt and are innocent until proven guilty.
An example: In 2004, after headlining a comedy show at an Austin club, I decided to check out the band I had met while doing radio. I was excited because they were fantastic, plus a hipster dude from the audience had slipped me some weed.
COMMENTARY: Trump isn't urging patriotism; he's provoking a culture war.
The problem started when I spilled half the pot onto my back seat. As I collected it, the surrounding light suddenly got intensely bright. I was in big trouble. Two fine officers of the Austin Police Department were now in my business shining their powerful flashlights on my pot.
"Good evening, officers," I said.
"Good evening, sir," said one of them. "What have you got there?"
There was no disguising what I had there.
"It's marijuana, sir. I'm a touring comedian. I just did a show. This is how I relax."
"I see. Any more in the car?"
CEDRIC GOLDEN: Patriotism still ranks ahead of human decency in this country.
The truth is, I did have another bud stashed — that Austin hipster was generous, doggone it — but I did not want to add any more illegal evidence to the situation. So instead, I copped to a lesser crime.
"Yes sir, I have this, too."
I handed him my pipe.
"One minute," he said.
There were several ways these cops could have handled this situation. Here's a stranger in their town with an illegal substance right out in the open, busted cold — an easy arrest and eventual conviction. It could have easily gone differently. Guns drawn, cuffs snapped on, an arrest made, maybe jail time. It would have been so easy for them to do all that — but these guys didn't.
They took my pipe, scattered my weed, and said, "OK, sir, have a nice evening." That is white privilege.
KIRK BOHLS: Don't rip pro players as unpatriotic SOBs — it's their country, too.
You could argue that it was because I was a headlining comic, or because I was polite or showed my hands at all times, but that's not why they let me go. It was because I'm white.
They did what a good cop should've done: listened to my story and decided that I was neither a criminal nor a threat.
What does it feel like to not have this benefit of the doubt? What does it feel like when a cop refuses to listen to your story? What does if you feel like when you somehow inexplicably get shot and killed as a result of this simple run-in? I have no idea because I have white privilege, white benefit of the doubt. I can't deny it — and if you're white, neither can you.
When someone tells you that you have white privilege, they're not trying to tell you that you've had it easy. All they are saying is that when it comes to being judged by a person of authority, if you are white, you will usually get the benefit of the doubt, and if you are black, you usually don't. That's why people are taking a knee.
Because in America, all citizens are supposed to be treated innocent until proven guilty. We are all supposed to get the benefit of the doubt. When someone feels like they're not getting that, they are understandably upset — so upset that they might be willing to interrupt something as sacred as the national anthem with a silent, kneeling protest.

A protest during the national anthem in front of the flag was chosen because both of these are meant to represent liberty and justice for all — and when you're not getting yours— your benefit of the doubt — in America you have a First Amendment right to take a knee and demand it. No matter what color you are.

OVERKILL – a Starbreeze Studio.
Today is national coming out day so I called my girlfriend early this morning. “Hello? Are you okay?” she asked, sleep and worry mixed in her voice. “I'm gay,” I said. “Today is national coming out day and I thought you should know.” “Goodbye.” She hung up. She's not a morning person. She also “came out” in her teens and I, a grown woman, am way behind. For me, coming out isn't as scary as it probably was for her in the mid-nineties.
I'm grown. I already had a baby “out of wedlock“, so I've experienced the worst of the anger caused by middle class politics of respectability. I have good friends. I had queer community before I even knew what it was. I'm an academic at an institution that is at least queer friendly on paper so I've learned how to develop systems of belief that make room for my whole being. I have enough queer politics to believe that anyone who has a problem with the way that I identify is at least misinformed about the nature of “natural.” I believe most things are socially constructed. I believe gender isn't a binary opposition. Nor is sex. I don't believe gender and sex are the same things. I believe in sexual fluidity and openness. I believe that texts, even the ones we hold most dear, are signs and therefore open to infinite interpretations. So what does a person with a belief profile like mine do on a day like today?
I was going to use my rainbow umbrella but it didn't rain.
I was going to hold hands with my girlfriend in public but I'm in a long distance relationship.
I was going to put an “Out and Proud” sticker on my car but I'm still paying for it.
I was going to write a post under my own name but I decided to create an alias especially for the family members who stalk me on this site even though they don't understand half of what is posted here. Runtelldat.
So I'm thinking. In the Judith Butler since of the concept, coming out may really be “going in”– into a box constructed by those who are hyper-vigilant about protecting their heterosexuality, a category that is as unstable as its binary opposition. In this dialectic, gay is what straight isn't. Gay is natural hair because straight is permed hair (no seriously. Many of you are reading this in big cities, but when I first brought my nappy head back to my hometown, I received knowing glances and women touched my thighs a lot in public. I thought they were cousins I'd forgotten until my brother told me I was being read as gay.). Gay is a pantsuit with brogans because straight is a skirt with heels. Gay is the avoidance of ridiculous shit like “strictly dickly” and other phrases that straight girls use to protect themselves from themselves. Straight is a system of binaries and gay is bending the line. So I don't want to come out just to go into some other box that will also confine me.
In a non-Butlerian, family sense, coming out is also “going in”– to communities constructed for those who get thrown out. I know that I'm going to get thrown out. I may not get to kiss my nephews and nieces anymore, as siblings have previously told me they don't want “that gay shit” around their kids. I may also be forced out of other communities, real and imagined. I know there are some “back-home” friendships that will sadly end. There is a person whose hand I held as her father took his last, rattling breaths. When my “coming out” reaches her, I wonder if she'll think that while I witnessed death up close for the first time, I was actually pushing back feelings of lust for her. I wasn't. There are places I haven't even been that will throw me out, places far less liberal than this relatively utopian community in which I live. Especially if I stay in the South. Queer folks stay getting whipped by the Bible Belt.
My friend also reminded me that in the black vernacular sense, coming out is also “going in.” I started this journey with a theory: sexuality is ultimately fluid (which reminds me, I need to rewrite this), and many of the behaviors that we think are natural are actually learned. I then practiced this theory by kissing a girl who smelled like fabric softener and that was the end of my heterosexuality. It was easy to give up. Why? Because it didn't really exist in the first place. Because sexuality exists on a continuum. Because we hold onto constructs that we think will save us until our fingertips bleed, and only when we slip do we realize that the abyss (in this case, whatever exists in excess of compulsory heterosexuality) is only two feet away. And its fun down there. And that was a pun. And that, gentle reader, is going in. Which is one of the things that I get to do (in the spirit of the Lorde) when I come out.
So I return to the notion of coming out and what it means for a grown woman academic who usually feels buttressed by the discourse in which she has chosen to reside. I wonder if coming out is for teenagers in search of community and protection from a system that denies children the right to be and find themselves. Is coming out just for married men who want to scare the world via Oprah? Is coming out for those whose celebrity will help secure rights and privileges for queer common folk like myself?
I think I'd rather just skip that part and go in, like Wayne sans misogyny. What do you think?

About 200 people who bought condo units in an Etobicoke high-rise project may lose their homes after the development was placed into court-ordered receivership due to massive financial problems.
The project, still only about 15 per cent complete six years after it was first marketed to potential buyers, will now be sold off by the receiver in a bidding process.
The buyers who paid for the pre-sold condos — 208 of the project's 242 units — will get their combined $6.3 million in deposits back. But the condos they bought and waited years to move into will likely be sold off at much higher current market values by whomever steps in to complete the project.
Some of the original buyers had purchased their units as far back as 2011 when Toronto home prices were about half of what they are today.
Development's collapse financially 'devastating' to many buyers
Toronto condo lawyer Denise Lash says many of those buyers may now find themselves priced out of the market.
"It can be devastating" she told CBC Toronto, adding if they want to buy their units from the new developer, it's likely "they have to purchase at 2017 prices, not the prices they paid [years earlier]."
Lash says while "it's rare" for condo projects to fail in Toronto's red-hot housing market, buyers should always "research the developer. There are resources ... do your due diligence when you're buying."
The project, proposed by Terrasan 327 Royal York and marketed through its sister company Stanton Renaissance, is located on Royal York Road adjacent to the Mimico GO station. Both Terrasan and Stanton Renaissance are owned by Toronto resident Louie Santaguida.
Aptly named On the Go Mimico, buyers were promised 27 storeys of luxuriously finished condo units with retail space on the main level. It was supposed to be the first condo building of its kind in Toronto with direct access to a Metrolinx station. Stanton Renaissance also promised buyers a "commitment to sustainable urban dvelopment."
But almost immediately there were problems. In 2012, Metrolinx backed away from the deal to partner with the developer. The regional transit agency's spokesperson, Anne Marie Aikins, told CBC Toronto that "some information had come to our attention that made this a less than desirable agreement to enter so we pulled out of that agreement [that year]."
By 2013, soon after excavation of the site began, crews walked off the job claiming they weren't being paid by the developer.
Developer had never built condos before, had history of corporate bankruptcies
Santaguida's other business ventures had a troubled history of bankruptcies leaving creditors on the hook for millions of dollars in unpaid bills. The financial issues prompted Brantford city council to walk away from an agreement that would have seen one of Santaguida's companies take on a big industrial redevelopment in that city.
Stanton Renaissance had never built a condominium or a residential tower anywhere before the company applied to the city of Toronto to build and sell its condos to hundreds of potential buyers.
The City cannot refuse to accept applications or issue approvals... - Bruce Hawkins, City of Toronto spokesperson
City councillors rezoned the land for the developer and staff issued the various building permits needed to move the project forward.
In an email to CBC Toronto, city spokesperson Bruce Hawkins wrote, "the City cannot refuse to accept applications or issue approvals (including both planning approval and building permits) on the basis of past history of the applicant/developer/owner, or based on an evaluation of the financial stability of the applicant/developer/owner."
Local councillor big booster of the condo project
The local councillor, Mark Grimes, who represents Ward 6, Etobicoke-Lakeshore, was a vocal proponent of the project. Grimes supported the developer's application to increase the height and number of units beyond what was permitted in the original proposal.
Grimes appeared in a promotional video for the project. While two other councillors were seen in the video, they didn't speak. Grimes, however, appeared to be wearing a wireless microphone under his golf shirt as he answered questions about the project.
"We're on the platform of a GO station. So, out your back door you walk one minute to the platform," he said in the video. "So, people who don't have a car, this is the place you want to buy."
In 2015, when CBC Toronto first outlined growing financial problems at the project, Grimes said he didn't know he was being filmed for promotional purposes. He also said the video was edited and used without his knowledge or consent.

Monday, in an email exchange with CBC Toronto, Grimes said he was not aware of the developer's previous financial history and that he feels "terrible for anyone who may lose their purchasing opportunity. It is very unfortunate that this happens quite often in the city."
He also added. "What's to say the market doesn't crash tomorrow and the buyers are better off than prior to the bankruptcy?"
Court documents allege the developer started defaulting on payments just months after being loaned $21 million in construction money last year. The documents also allege Santaguida directed more than $2 million earmarked for the project to other uses.
Land registry records show trades companies have put more than $5 million in liens on the project, claiming the developer hasn't paid them for work completed. The tower is only about 10-15 per cent done. according to documents filed by the court-appointed receiver.
Local community groups are also affected by the financial collapse of the condo project.
The city allowed Stanton Renaissance to use a historic train station located in a public park across the street from the construction site as a sales centre for more than two years.
In return, Stanton Renaissance agreed to restore the building. Community groups say the developer has left the building looking like a modern condo sales office, not a historic train station as they believed was promised.
Stanton Renaissance's website boasts plans to build three more condo projects in Toronto and Hamilton.
CBC Toronto reached out to Santaguida through Stanton Renaissance, but did not receive a reply.
Founders Brewing Co. announced today that they will launch Green Zebra, a gose-style ale brewed with watermelon and sea salt. Debuting this August, Green Zebra will be the fifth release Founders has brewed for ArtPrize, an open international art competition which takes place each fall in the brewery's hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Previous releases in the lineup include Pale Joe, Spectra Trifecta, Mosaic Promise and Inspired Artist Black IPA. Green Zebra is the first gose in the series, and also the first ArtPrize release to debut in cans. Proceeds from the sale of Green Zebra go towards the sponsorship of ArtPrize.
Check out our review of Founders FrootwoodCherry Ale in Maple-Bourbon Barrels!
“ArtPrize is one of the most well-attended public art events in the world, and we are proud to continue our support,” said Co-Founder and President, Dave Engbers. “We love playing with expectations when it comes to brewing our ArtPrize beers and Green Zebra is the perfect example of that. The gose style is very unique and pretty unknown, even amongst craft beer drinkers, and we wanted to bring our version of it to a larger audience. For the first time ever, our ArtPrize beer will be available across our entire distribution network so even more of our fans can get to know this style we've fallen in love with.”
Watermelon is the highlight of this lightly-hopped treat and gives it a hint of satisfying juiciness. The soft mouthfeel and dry finish comes courtesy of the addition of sea salt, a traditional gose ingredient. Green Zebra comes in at 4.6% ABV and 10 IBUs.
In keeping with the artful tradition established with Spectra Trifecta and Pale Joe, the Green Zebra label is an original work of art designed by a member of the Founders team. Jacob Wiseheart from the Founders taproom created the label artwork, a stand-out for its striking and intense use of color and dimension, perfectly suited to the lively, bright nature of the beer.
Green Zebra will be available in the taproom beginning on August 15, 2017 with the remaining 46-state distribution area receiving it by the end of the month in limited quantities. Founders Green Zebra will be exclusively available in 6-packs of 12-oz cans with a suggested retail price of $9.99.
Founders Green Zebra will be available in 12 ounce cans/6-packs starting August 15th.
Style: Gose (w/ Watermelon. Sea Salt.)

Artificial Intelligence vs. Human Intelligence
According to Kernel founder Bryan Johnson: “The market for implantable neural prosthetics including cognitive enhancement and treatment of neurological dysfunction will likely be one of if not the largest industrial sectors in history.”
“AI” is a loaded, loaded term.
For basketball fans of a particular vintage, it conjures memories of a pint-sized shoot-first point guard who reportedly showed up for press avails under the influence of at least one mind-altering substance.
Allen Iverson even established some general pop-culture visibility with his on- and off-court exploits. He was a quintessential “good news-bad news” basketball story.
Though the former Philadelphia 76ers superstar is now an NBA Hall of Famer, nowadays AI is all about artificial intelligence.
But this AI is more than a simple “good news-bad news” dichotomy. There's a lot of nuance in the space between those poles.
“AI” is a loaded, loaded term.
Let's start with the bad.
The generalized fear – one expressed even by eminences such as prize-winning physicist Stephen Hawking – is that one day AI-driven robots will establish dominion over humanity.
Speaking at the Zeitgeist 2015 conference in London, Hawking predicted, “Computers will overtake humans with AI at some within the next 100 years. When that happens, we need to make sure the computers have goals aligned with ours.”
That fear grows from the unknown.
And there are abundant unknowns associated with even the potentially enormous positive contributions AI can make – in the highly topical field of cybersecurity, for example.
“Computers will overtake humans with AI at some within the next 100 years. When that happens, we need to make sure the computers have goals aligned with ours.”
As Ars Technica U.K.'s Sebastian Anthony reported on October 28, 2016:
Google Brain has created two artificial intelligences that evolved their own cryptographic algorithm to protect their messages from a third AI, which was trying to evolve its own method to crack the AI-generated crypto. The study was a success: The first two AIs learnt how to communicate securely from scratch.
This “cryptographic algorithm” developed by Martín Abadi and David G. Andersen is only a start. As Anthony writes, “The results were… a mixed bag.”
We have no idea how the researchers' AIs – named Alice, Bob, and Eve – created what amount to their own algorithms to encrypt messages. There's a solution, but no explanation. That means commercialization is hard to imagine right now.
At the same time, in his review of Abadi's and Andersen's “preprint paper” on the topic, Edd Gent of Singularity Hub observes:
Neural nets may be quite effective in making sense of communications metadata and for traffic analysis on computer networks. This is the kind of area where many think machine learning has a lot to offer cybersecurity because modern AI's are great at spotting patterns, and they can process far more data than humans.
Still: “no one knows how it works.”
Meanwhile, AI's potential continues to amaze in other lab settings.
As MIT's Carl Vondrick explains to Victoria Turk of New Scientist that “any robot that operates in our world needs to have some basic ability to predict the future. For example, if you're about to sit down, you don't want a robot to pull the chair out from underneath you.”
Vondrick and his team have developed a deep-learning algorithm that “can predict how a scene will unfold and dream up a vision of the immediate future.”
Reports Turk:
To develop their AI, the team trained it on 2 million videos from image-sharing site Flickr, featuring scenes such as beaches, golf courses, train stations, and babies in hospital. These videos were unlabeled, meaning they were not tagged with information to help an AI understand them. After this, the researchers gave the model still images and it produced its own micro-movies of what might happen next.
Success hinged on combining computer vision with machine learning and then, according to John Daugman at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, recognizing unfolding causal relationships over time.
We've discussed AI's ability to perform “human” functions, including Psibernetix Inc.'s fuzzy logic-based ALPHA, artificial intelligence programmed to fly fighter jets that has beaten several “top guns” in dogfight simulations.
As Evan Ackerman and Andrew Silver of IEEE Spectrum write: “Developing an unmanned aircraft is a complex and expensive process.”
So Psibernetix's accomplishment is significant.
“Even retrofitting manned aircraft for autonomous operation,” note Ackerman and Silver, “can be tricky.”
Well, the Unmanned Systems Research Group at South Korea's KAIST (formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) is “testing a humanoid robot that's designed to operate a regular aircraft by sitting in the pilot's seat and using the controls just like a human would.”
Check out the PiBot's (pilot robot) skills on a flight simulator.
Of course, ALPHA and PiBot could eventually be deployed as part of a Skynet-like AI army.
So let's close with one item that may qualify as an unabashed “good” – an explanation for how we'll make good on Stephen Hawking's challenge to align the computers' goals with ours.
We first zeroed in on Kernel – “a human intelligence (HI) company developing the world's first neuroprosthesis to mimic, repair, and improve cognition” – in the August 24 Wall Street Daily issue. We spotlighted the company in our brief NBNBC mini-feature.
(“NBNBC” is an acronym for “no balls, no blue chips.” To do great things, you have to take great risks. Once a week, on Wednesdays, we focus on a company or innovator taking on a big challenge in a big way.)
So let's close with one item that may qualify as an unabashed “good” – an explanation for how we'll make good on Stephen Hawking's challenge to align the computers' goals with ours.
Bryan Johnson, the 39-year-old serial entrepreneur, recently announced he would put up another $100 million to fund Kernel's mission. He's already ploughed millions into the new company via his venture capital firm OS Fund.
Kernel has set out “to dramatically increase our quality of life as we increasingly extend healthy life spans.”
As we noted in August, “Kernel's first goal is to develop a device that supplants or supplements the input and/or output of the nervous system for patients with cognitive disorders.”
Johnson's new investment “will expedite the development of this prosthetic and similarly transformative neurotechnologies.”
As he articulates by explaining the timing of the fresh $100 million, Johnson's vision of AI is quintessentially human:
Why now? Because the sooner we begin co-evolving human and machine intelligence, the better. The relationship between human intelligence and artificial intelligence (HI + AI) will necessarily be one of symbiosis. The challenge and potential of exploring this co-evolutionary future is the biggest story of the next century and one in which a closeness in development velocity is a necessity. In order for that to happen, we need to begin working on HI in earnest.
This is the ultimate expression of the Law of Accelerating Convergence.
And it just might represent, as Johnson suggests, “one of if not the largest industrial sectors in history.”
NBNBC
Johnson's OS Fund has also invested in Boston-based synthetic biology startup Ginkgo Bioworks, which “designs custom microbes for customers across multiple markets.”
Ginkgo builds its “foundries to scale the process of organism engineering using software and hardware automation. Organism engineers at Ginkgo learn from nature to develop new organisms that replace technology with biology.”
Ginkgo has raised $154 million in two years, including a $100 million round of Series C funding announced in June 2016 that will help it buy 600 million base pairs of synthetic DNA.
The new investment will enable the company to expand its production of synthetic microbes into fields such as “commodity chemicals, industrial enzymes, and human health markets.”
A big part of that effort revolves around Bioworks2, Ginkgo's new facility where sophisticated data analysis, advanced automation, and DNA synthesis drive creation of new prototype organisms.
It's yet another example of convergence – synthetic biology and robotics engineering – that promises great and good things for humanity.

Former President Barack Obama's administration claimed that it cared about illegal immigrants and about finding a road map to allow them to pursue citizenship legally. However, data were just released that show exactly how backed-up that process became, and it's looking like a huge traffic jam.
According to Breitbart, there are currently more than 500,000 pending immigration court cases for illegal aliens. The cases will decide whether the illegal immigrants are eligible to stay in the United States.
The data, from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, were obtained by Fox News to tally the number of pending immigration cases that have yet to be decided by an immigration judge. The final number was 542,111.
Why this number is significant is twofold. First, it gives some idea of the amount of money American taxpayers have to pay for illegal immigrants to be held in detention centers, sometimes for more than a year, before their cases are heard by an immigration court.
States with higher illegal immigrant populations, such as Texas and California, show that the wait can be even longer, often up to three years. In San Francisco alone, a sanctuary city, there are 38,428 pending cases.
The second reason that number is so important is because it shows the gross negligence the Obama administration displayed when it came to dealing with illegal immigration. Obama wanted a pathway for illegal immigrants to stay in this country. It seems as if he found it by stalling cases as much as possible, giving those people plenty of time to live in the United States illegally.
U.S. Immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks spoke to Fox News about the vast backlog in immigration courts and stated that administration after administration had done virtually nothing to remedy the issue.
“We have been a neglected part of the immigration enforcement world for so long,” Marks said. “There are legitimate concerns about how long cases pend in the immigration court.”
That neglect is looking like it stops with President Donald Trump. He has placed great emphasis on dealing with illegal immigration. For illegal immigrants, the buck — the taxpayer dollar — stops with Trump.

America's iconic Route 66 is about to become part of a new solar system.
The Idaho startup Solar Roadways, created by husband-and-wife team Scott and Julie Brusaw, is working with the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) to install a section of solar panels at a rest stop on Rt. 66 in Conway, Mo. The aim is to see if the roadway can generate enough electricity to power the rest facility and potentially fund future projects.
"Solar roadways can hopefully create new revenue streams," said Tom Blair, assistant district engineer for MoDOT and head of the "Road to Tomorrow" long-range planning effort, local Missouri paper The News Tribune reports. "Technology already has changed how we think about different things in our lives," he said, "and it is going to disrupt everything that every one of us transportation leaders have experienced to date in our life."
As a company, Solar Roadways (SR) aims to generate renewable energy on any surface that can be walked or driven on, from roadways to sidewalks, driveways to bike and garden paths. A significant amount of solar energy is already hitting those surfaces, SR says, but doesn't go to good use – yet. Harnessing that power could be a step towards a smarter power grid and better infrastructure, they say, claiming that widespread use could significantly lower or eliminate consumers' electric bills and reduce greenhouse gasses by up to 75 percent.
The tempered glass hexagonal panels that make up their "roadways" weigh about 70 pounds and contain LED lights. The panels are textured for slip resistance and can warm up to keep roads free of ice and snow. In a parking area, or installed at a rest stop such as the one in Conway, the panels can also generate the lines for a basketball court or hopscotch.
The road test in Missouri has been at least five years in the making. In July of 2011, the Brusaws were awarded a two-year $750,000 contract by the US Department of Transportation, which allowed them to conduct more research and build the world's first prototype solar parking lot adjacent to their headquarters in Sandpoint, Idaho.
The couple's efforts gained global attention with a viral Indiegogo campaign, which got an extra boost from Star Trek actor George Takei on social media in 2014, with a promotional video by Michael Naphan that pulled in more than 20 million views on Youtube. The campaign netted $2.2 million in donations for further development on the project.
Creating the textured glass surface was one of the challenges addressed during that phase of development, according to the Solar Roadways' website, as they tested various textures and panel shapes before deciding in hexagons.
Solar roads in Europe
The use of solar panels for road surfacing may be new to the United States, but Europe is farther down the solar road.
In 2015, the Netherlands made headlines with the installation of the world's first solar road, a bike path that captured energy through glass-coated solar panels. After the first six months, the 230-foot test bike path generated 3,000 kWh, or enough electricity to power a small household for a year.
In France, the government recently announced plans to resurface 621 miles of roads with solar panels, using Wattway panels that were developed by road-building company Colas in partnership with the French National Solar Energy Institute.
However, the French panels are only designed for use in the generation of renewable energy. They function the same way a standard solar panel would work, but instead of taking up farmland or rooftops, they cover the road surface. Unlike Solar Roadways' hexagons, the Wattway panels are installed in sheets, and lack LED lights or heating.
Aging infrastructure
While US solar enthusiasts may celebrate this first effort in Missouri, those who monitor the life cycle of traditional road constructions materials such as concrete and asphalt at the concrete sustainability hub for the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Mass., have a more jaded view.
"We can barely afford the upkeep on the asphalt and concrete we already have," says James W. Mack, PE Director, Market Development for CEMEX, the world's fourth largest supplier of concrete and redimix, in a telephone interview and research partner at the MIT hub.
"I don't want to naysay the innovations," Mr. Mack says in a phone interview from his office in Houston. "I love innovations. I'm an early adopter, but there are going to be some sustainability and durability issues. I wouldn't do the road surface. I'd run them [the hexagonal panels] down the shoulders first. They'll last longer."
SR, however, argues that currently most states' departments of transportation don't generate enough income through the gas tax to be able to keep up with road repairs.

"We are not preventing any roads or bridges from being built or maintained because of this pilot project," Mr. Blair of MoDOT told the News Tribune, adding that a successful test run could increase energy savings and contribute toward future needs.
"It is obvious that it is time to modernize the highway system and create the first roadway system with a return on investment (ROI)," SR says on its website. "In this way, two goals can be accomplished simultaneously: the creation of a modular, modern infrastructure while creating the renewable energy needed to effectively end the current dependence on fossil fuels."
House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanBrexit and exit: A transatlantic comparison Five takeaways from McCabe's allegations against Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Sanders set to shake up 2020 race MORE (R-Wis.) is weighing in on Georgia's special House election, recording a robocall encouraging Republicans in the state's 6th Congressional District to get out the vote, The Washington Post reported Thursday.
The election is set for next Tuesday and pits a crowded field of GOP candidates against Democrat Jon Ossoff, who has gained a high profile among other Democrats in recent weeks as the race to fill now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's vacated seat heats up.

Ossoff raised more than $8 million for the race, putting at risk a House seat that has long been in Republican hands. What's more, the party is dealing with a fractured field of candidates, and Republicans have not overwhelmingly rallied around any single one.
But Ryan's fundraising operation brought in more than $22 million in the first quarter of 2017 — a sizable haul that will largely go to other GOP candidates.
The Georgia election marks the next big electoral hurdle for Republicans, who narrowly retained a House seat in Kansas's 4th District this week. There, Ron Estes, the Republican Kansas state treasurer, beat out Democrat James Thompson by only 7 percentage points — a small margin in a district typically considered safe for GOP candidates.
Since we're gin people, we're making classic cocktails (and riffing off them) with Tanqueray No. TEN. Today, Jeffrey Morgenthaler shares his favorite riff on the French 75, with a little blush.
When I asked Jeffrey Morgenthaler, a Portland-based bar manager and author of The Bar Book, to come up with a holiday cocktail recipe that made people feel celebratory and revelrous, but didn't scream apple or cranberry or clove, I wasn't sure what he'd send back. I definitely didn't expect something like the Bowie Knife.
Bright and sparkly, frittering with energy and a look reminiscent of drinks you'd find on a plane in a Mad Men episode circa season 6 or 7, it initially seems like a drink more fitting for a different time of year. But, as Jeffrey explained, it's just a slight riff on a classic cocktail anyone would make for a holiday party, or New Year's Eve.

"It's really just a French 75 made with sparkling rosé. I have always liked the name Bowie Knife and wanted to use it in a cocktail that was crisp and cutting, like a knife," Jeffrey told me. "The rosé has just a little bit more tannin, so it's nice and crisp. It works so well with food!"
And this drink is just that—pale pink and floaty as a cloud when you sip it, it seems otherworldy when compared to the regular flavors of the season. And as Jeffrey mentions, it's a drink suited well for a big brunch.

"The Bowie Knife is actually on our brunch menu. I think French 75s are so great with brunch. Just a little bit of gin, but certainly not too much," Jeffrey said. "You can have a couple of these and still carry on with your day." Amen to that, especially during the holidays.

The UN watchdog monitoring Iran's nuclear activities confirmed that the country is fully in compliance with its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, even as Donald Trump, who labelled it “the worst deal ever,” threatens to scrap it.
“Iran has conducted its enrichment activities in line with its long-term enrichment and R&D enrichment plan” agreed with world powers, according to the six-page confidential document, seen by several news agencies, including Iran's IRNA.

Iran is also not conducting “any uranium enrichment or related research and development activities” at its Fordo nuclear plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) added, as cited by AFP.
Tehran is not pursuing construction of its existing heavy water research reactor and has not enriched uranium above the agreed 3.67-percent limit, the report concluded, adding that Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium (which can be used for peaceful purposes unless further processed for a nuclear weapon) was 101.7kg – considerably lower than the agreed level of 300kg.
Iran's ambassador and permanent representative to the agency, Reza Najafi, said the IAEA's report demonstrated, among other things, that the “US official's rhetoric and media hype has not impacted its verifications activities and reporting on the case,” IRNA says.
US President Donald Trump, however, threatened to withhold his certification of Tehran's compliance when he is next required to report to Congress in October. “If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal in late July.
Last week, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley visited the IAEA. Following talks with officials of the UN nuclear watchdog, she concluded that there are apparently “numerous undeclared sites” and that more inspections are required. Iran dismissed the call as “merely a dream.”
The IAEA has the authority to request access to facilities in Iran, including military, if there are any credible indications of banned nuclear activities. “We're not going to visit a military site like Parchin just to send a political signal,” an IAEA official told Reuters, referring to a military site often cited by critics of the deal. He noted that “if they [Trump administration] want to bring down the deal, they will,” while also stressing that the resort does not want to “give them an excuse” to do that. “We just don't want to give them an excuse to.”
Read more
The IAEA director, Yukiya Amano, told AP that the agency has access to all locations “without making distinctions between military and civilian locations.”
Trump, Haley seek to break 2015 deal
The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) said in a statement on Thursday that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are making false allegations against Tehran to justify scrapping the nuclear deal that Iran has been honoring.
The US president “has violated the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and continues to hold the fate of the accord in doubt by threatening to withhold a congressionally mandated certification of Iran's compliance in mid-October,” the National Iranian American Council (NIAC) policy director Jamal Abdi said.
“There is a reason why Trump can't point to any specific evidence to justify his assertions that Iran is noncompliant with the nuclear accord. The IAEA, US intelligence community and our allies in the P5+1 have all affirmed Iran's compliance.”
In mid-August, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned that Iran could backtrack on its 2015 nuclear agreement “within hours” if Washington slaps new sanctions on Tehran. Rouhani also pointed out that Washington has proved to be an “unreliable negotiator,” while the US under Trump's leadership simply “ignored international agreements.”

Last month, Trump signed into law a bill, passed by the US Congress, which imposes sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea. Following the controversial decision, prominent libertarian and former Congressman Ron Paul accused Trump of betraying his promises to the American people by seeking a new conflict with either Iran or North Korea, warning the president that any such war will put an end to his term.
The landmark 2015 agreement saw Iran officially agreeing to halt parts of its nuclear program and subject other sectors to increased UN monitoring in exchange for the removal of economic sanctions.
Following months of negotiations, the long-awaited deal was signed between Tehran and major world powers – the US, France, Britain, Russia, and China, plus Germany. Under the deal, called the (JCPOA), Tehran also agreed to cap its uranium enrichment below the level needed for bomb-grade material. It also vowed to reduce its enriched uranium stockpile from around 10,000kg to 300kg for 15 years and agreed to international inspections. In response, Western countries agreed to lift sanctions.
Referring to the recent demands by the US envoy to the UN on additional inspections of sensitive sites in Iran, Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, claimed that Washington “is pressing” the IAEA “in the hope of provoking a refusal [from Tehran] that would justify a finding of noncompliance.”
There are many a craft beer out there that cater to those instances of casual drinking – when you'd like to throw back a few tasty beverages and get your chill on. And then, there are those brews that are so complex, so busy, and just so damn fancy, that you can't help but slide into your best evening wear and drink with your pinky out. Seventh Son's Ladies and Gentlemen falls into the latter category. A surprisingly bitter barleywine that rumbles in at 11% ABV, this brew is vast, spanning all over the flavor map. Throw on your top hat, it's drinking time.
This odyssey begins with a bouquet of rich, bready malts. A touch of raisin supports from the side, while a mild caramel sweetness settles over top a moment later. At the same time, an underlying citrus bloom begins to grow, consisting of orange zest and peaches, while hints of limes make an appearance every now and then. As the aroma continues, notes of tea and toast creep in from the sides, before a breeze of vanilla finishes off the breath. Visually, this brew pours a rich, burnt amber with a frothy head that hangs around a while.
On the tongue, the brew begins with a slightly prickly bitterness that works its way to the sides of the mouth. Notes of caramel and slightly burnt toffee arrive next, immediately followed by big bread malts and toasted crust. Like the aroma, an underlying layer of orange zest, lime juice, and grapefruit add a bright and lingering bitterness, aside from the straight up hoppage that's there from the beginning. As the moments pass, graham crackers and a hint of vanilla tip the scales back towards the malts ever so slightly, while a slow-building alcohol warmth begins to send your throat ‘atingle. Mildly creamy and filling the mouth, the brew draws to a close with a touch of sweetness that lingers at the back of the mouth, before diminishing to a bitter finish. Though it weighs in at 11%, the strength is masked for the most part, making this brew wonderfully drinkable as long as you take your time and enjoy in a dignified manner (pinky-raising is optional, though suggested).
If Ladies and Gentlemen were a person, it would most definitely wear a suit at all hours. But, that suit would be the bright orange tux of Lloyd Christmas, and it would scream whenever it spoke. The traditional barleywine staples are here – big malts, potent warmth, and mild barrel-sweetness – but the addition of a hefty handful of hops and a citrus character of supernova brightness sets this brew apart from many others. Though this beer had a limited release, there are some bottles still out there. And trust me, they're worth looking for.
Global warming will benefit most Arctic species, a team of scientists reports in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One. According to the scientists, global warming will allow most Arctic species to expand their ranges, and no species are expected to go extinct. The findings deliver a sharp jab to global warming activists arguing Arctic warming justifies costly, government imposed economic restrictions.
Ecological and environmental scientists at Sweden's Umea University began their study assuming Arctic and subarctic species would be particularly susceptible to present and future global warming.
“The area of tundra is expected to decrease and temperate climates will extend further north, affecting species inhabiting northern environments. Consequently, species at high latitudes should be especially susceptible to climate change, likely experiencing significant range contractions,” the scientists explained at the beginning of their study.
Moreover, global warming activists have raised particular concern about species in Arctic and subarctic Europe.
“It is supposed that the large expected climate change at high northern latitudes therefore makes species in (sub)arctic regions particularly susceptible, especially the European part of the (Sub)arctics, since this region is the most geographically complex with the most infrastructure and great cultural, social, and political heterogeneity,” the scientists noted.
After modeling the effects of global warming in European high latitudes, however, the scientists reported that global warming alarmists are entirely wrong about the impact of global warming on Arctic and subarctic species. In reality, global warming is likely to benefit most Arctic and subarctic species.
“Contrary to these expectations, our modeling of species distributions suggests that predicted climate change up to 2080 will favor most mammals presently inhabiting (sub)arctic Europe,” the scientists reported.
According to the scientists, “most species will benefit from climate change, except for a few cold-climate specialists.” Of the relatively few Arctic and subarctic species that will not benefit from global warming, most are alpine species.
Importantly, no species will go extinct, the scientists report.
“Our results indicate that, irrespective of the scenario, most species (43 out of 61) will expand and shift their ranges, mostly in a north-easterly direction, in response to expected climate change if we assume that species are able to colonize all areas that become climatically suitable,” the scientists observed.
Most species will dramatically expand their ranges as the climate warms, the scientists discovered. Accordingly, global warming will enhance rather than restrict biodiversity.
“The average range expansion [is] predicted to be 12068% under the A2 scenario and 8355% under the B2 scenario,” the scientists reported. “We further predict that, irrespective of the scenario, the climate in (sub)arctic Europe will become suitable to ten more mammalian species. …Thus, mammalian species richness in (sub)arctic Europe is likely to increase substantially when full dispersal ability is assumed.”
Even if human alterations to the landscape preclude species from expanding their ranges to newly suitable lands, no animals will go extinct.
“When we assumed that species will not be able to disperse beyond areas that are currently suitable for them, we found that the vast majority of species will likely lose part of their geographic range, but none is predicted to go extinct.
Global warming activists frequently point to Arctic mammals as being particularly susceptible to global warming, but the scientists reported Arctic mammals will be among the greatest beneficiaries of Arctic warming.
“The reason for the relative stability of mammalian presence might be that arctic regions have experienced large climatic shifts in the past, filtering out sensitive and range-restricted taxa,” the scientists reported. “We also provide evidence that for most (sub)arctic mammals it is not climate change per se that will threaten them, but possible constraints on their dispersal ability and changes in community composition.”
“In contrast to the general belief that species inhabiting the (sub)arctics will face increased levels of stress due to climate change, our work suggests that the climate in sub(arctic) Europe will ameliorate the future conditions for most of its mammalian species. Warmer and wetter conditions favor more species,” the scientists concluded.
It's official: Naspers launches video streaming service ShowMax
Share
Naspers today officially announced the launch of ShowMax, its Netflix-style online streaming service.
At an event in Johannesburg, the emerging markets internet and media giant revealed that the service will cost R99 a month.
In addition to the online offering, ShowMax has a companion app which is already available for download on Android and iOS
Among the shows available on ShowMax from day one: are The Big Bang Theory, Ray Donovan, Vikings, and True Blood.
While the service officially launched today, reports of its development have been circulating for some time now.
While earlier media reports suggested that Naspers' ability to launch ShowMax was the result of an acquisition of UAE-based streaming company Icflix, the truth is actually a little different. While ShowMax does use Iclflix technology, it's not entirely reliant on it.
When asked if the launch of ShowMax was a bid by Naspers to pre-empt the official launch of Netflix in South Africa (expected to happen before the end of 2016), ShowMax GM John Kotsafti said that it was more important to view ShowMax as a startup.
Read more: Netflix prepares for global expansion [Update: it's coming to South Africa]
“Nothing is as important as this project,” he said at the event. “We've had to take a long-term view on this. We believe it's the future.”
He also said that the company doesn't see ShowMax as a threat to its various satellite TV offerings (which brought in the bulk of the R42.4-billion it made from video entertainment in FY15). Through its subsidiary Multichoice, Naspers runs the DStv and GOtv satellite offerings.
There are a number of reasons for that. For one, Naspers subsidiary Supersport is the predominant player in South African sports broadcasting. It has rights to local soccer, rugby, and cricket and broadcast partnerships for major sporting events around the globe. Hardly surprising then that you can only access all of its sports channels with a premium DStv subscription.
Read more: Naspers' Netflix competitor to be called ShowMax
For another, there's still a very long way to go before the majority of South Africans can afford the kind of internet subscription that allows for regular use of a streaming service.
Until that changes and an internet streaming player wrestles some of those rights away from Supersport, satellite TV is likely to remain a viable option for Naspers.
Still, it's interesting to note that ShowMax was initially developed within DStv parent company Multichoice before splitting it off and moving it offshore for a number of business reasons.
Kotsafti also revealed that the service would most likely adopt the Netflix and Amazon Prime model of producing original content and that the the service's first commissioned show would probably go live before the end of the year.
ShowMax will be run out of Johannesburg, where it already occupies office space and employs around 50 people. Among its high profile hires is former Vodacom head of corporate communications Richard Boorman.
Nobel Prize for literature winner Seamus Heaney has said there will never be a united Ireland and that Loyalists should be allowed to fly their flag over Belfast City Hall.
Heaney, born a Catholic in rural Derry, and has refused many British honors, made his remarks in an interview with The Times of London.
The poet has sometimes been accused of not writing about Northern Ireland issues so his comments are unexpected. He said Loyalists should be allowed to fly their flags as not to do so is very dangerous.
He addressed the Loyalist protests since Belfast City Council voted to only fly the Union Jack on 15 days of the year as it is in every other British jurisdiction.

“It's very dangerous indeed. Somebody made this remark, and it made me alert to a new possibility — they said, if this goes on until the marching season, everything is, in a sense, lost.”
The Loyalists, he says, “perceive themselves as almost deserted. And right enough. I think Sinn Fein could have taken it easy. No hurry on flags. Jesus.”
“What does it matter? But — it matters utterly to them. And now there's no way they're going to go back on it, of course. As someone who knows something of prejudice, from early on, I can understand the Loyalists — but the unremittingness of it ... I remember, at the very beginning of the Troubles in Derry, Eddie McAteer, a big Nationalist politician, he was like the paterfamilias of Nationalism. And he said, ‘both sides are entitled to their pageantry!' Which was a rather grand utterance, but true enough. But there's no doubt that the Loyalist side take the pageantry to extremes, they wipe the floor with the others.”
“Loyalism, or Unionism, or Protestantism, or whatever you want to call it, in Northern Ireland it operates not as a class system, but a caste system. And they [the Loyalists] have an entitlement factor running: the flag is part of it. There's never going to be a united Ireland, you know,” he says. “So why don't you let them fly the flag?”
In 1982 Heaney objected to being called a British poet. He wrote: “My passport's green/No glass of ours was ever raised/to toast the Queen.”
He also refused the opportunity to become the United Kingdom's Poet Laureate, saying: “I've nothing against the Queen personally: I had lunch at the Palace once upon a time.”

Villagers reacted with outrage on Sunday after more than 500 swingers invaded their sleepy, secluded hamlet for a weekend of debauchery and orgies.
The 'Swingfields 2015' festival has been taking place in Flaxley, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, over the weekend.
Villagers said there had been no advance warning and the event, dubbed the biggest in the swinging calendar, had come as a complete shock.
The 30 or so residents who live in cottages in the village, which has a 12th century abbey and a holy well, were stunned when hundreds of swingers started arriving with tents, vans and cars.
The Swingfields festival started in July 2013 and has been running annually since then, and was held in Worcestershire last year but switched to Flaxley this year.
Swingers began arriving in Flaxley on Thursday and had to leave the area by 2pm on Sunday.
• What it's like to go swinging
The location was kept a secret from ticket holders until two days before the festival began to ensure it remained “discreet and secure”.
However this also meant residents were also unaware about what was coming to their village.
Some described the noise and shrieks from the swingers' campsite as “intolerable” and said they should have been warned in advance.
One villager, who asked not to be named, said: "It was quite a shock when we went down to the gates on Thursday night to ask them to keep the music down.
"Let's just say when we saw a banner with the words '3 is the magic number' and a variety of interesting images we knew this wasn't just your usual music festival."
• Swingers and nudist holiday company promises 'discretion and an all-over tan'
Another villager said "It is not about the nature of the festival - people can do what they like in private.
"It's the noise which has just been intolerable. It has been 48 hours of hell. I have had just four hours of sleep since Thursday.
"We keep going to ask the organisers to turn the music down and have contacted Environmental Health and the police but nothing has been done."
Another resident said "It's absolutely bloody awful. This is taking it too far. I don't think it should be happening.
"There must be 1,000 people there, it's ridiculous. It is just wrong on a moralistic ground."
A neighbour said "We returned home from an evening bike ride on Friday night to discover an intruder in our garden trying to break into the festival.
"I was absolutely terrified we didn't know who he was or what he wanted so I called 999.
"Thankfully as soon as he saw us he ran off but now I'm quite concerned about who might be coming on to my land."
According to the Swingfields 2015 website festival goers can enjoy '360 degree panoramic views' in a 'quiet and private countryside location'.
As well as three days of live music the festival promised attendees a themed zone, hot tubs and a sauna, a chill pool, workshops, live shows and stalls selling adult toys.
People who attended the festival were able to camp or stay in a camper van for the duration of the event.
The organisers' website said single men were entitled to attend but limits on numbers were put in place to ensure 'a perfect balance for all guests'.
It also explained that while there was not a strict dress code attendees were told 'we will expect bottom halves at least to be covered whilst in the festival arena'.

Olympic gymnastics team leotards have dramatically changed from their first memorable designs. Over time, the emphasis on what leotards are intended to do has changed. Originally, the intent was to cover as much of a woman's body as possible, while today, leotards must breathe, improve aerodynamics and seamlessly re-shape as female athletes bend, twist and contort their way through increasingly difficult routines. Below are 6 example periods chock full of photos chronicling the shift in styles and thought about leotards.
6. 1896 – The First Olympics, Athens, Greece
The first-ever 1896 Summer Olympics starts us off with mustached men in what looks like their pajamas. Unfortunately, women weren't allowed in the 1896 Summer Olympics, so comparing these outfits to the stylish leotards of today just wouldn't be fair.
5. In 1908, the Danish team wore “leotards,” that were really more like dresses. Yards of extra fabric prevented any sort of idea about the figure of the woman underneath.
Picture from the Hulton Archive
4. In 1948, lady gymnasts word leotards closer to the style we see today. The fit was rather baggy, textiles of the time did not allow for the skin tight fit we see today, but the shape and cut was recognizably a leotard, albeit one that had never heard of hi-cut.
I like to call that one, “Help! My Leotard is strangling me!”
3. In 1960, British gymnasts wore leos with vintage flare, but also showed that though gymnastics is a team sport, not everyone must wear the same uniform. Colors, patterns and self-expression are certainly something you can bring to the competition, as demonstrated by these lovely ladies.
Picture from Express/Express/Getty Images
2. After 1960, leotards became progressively more colorful, and hi-cut legs became standard. Styles altered dramatically, with different leotards used for different programs. Everything from tuxedo inspired to tie-dyed leos performed on the olympic floor; however, traditional leotards with the elements of the country flag still dominated during the Olympics.
Of course, the stars on the butt of this particular design won't make it into a fashion hall of fame anywhere, but the flag–inspired team uniform was the standard of the time.

Dominique Dawes won medals in three consecutive olympic games — 1992, 1996 and 2000. Even just during her time, you can see the progress that women's olympic leotards make.
2008 – Beijing, China Summer Games
The 2008 summer games shows us just how much leotard designs can differ between athletes now.
Shawn Johnson (gold medalist, 2008) was the big name of that olympic year.
This was a red leo of hers. Look at how similar her form is to the next picture.
Here was her famous red, white and blue-colored leo from her beam routine.
1. Today, leotards range from fairly modest, long sleeves, high neckline, full bottom, to incredibly revealing, showing a lot of “skin.” Patriotism takes a back seat to looking and feeling good when performing. This year, Gabby Douglas in a metallic pink, bejeweled leotard designed by Ralph Lauren, put the old flag based designs to bed. Looking good and feeling good contributes to higher scores.
And this is her incredible sparkly pink leo.

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — The technology that charges batteries for electronic devices could provide fresh water from salty seas, says a new study by University of Illinois engineers. Electricity running through a salt water-filled battery draws the salt ions out of the water.
Illinois mechanical science and engineering professor Kyle Smith and graduate student Rylan Dmello published their work in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society.
“We are developing a device that will use the materials in batteries to take salt out of water with the smallest amount of energy that we can,” Smith said. “One thing I'm excited about is that by publishing this paper, we're introducing a new type of device to the battery community and to the desalination community.”
Interest in water desalination technology has risen as water needs have grown, particularly in drought-stricken areas. However, technical hurdles and the enormous amounts of energy required have prevented wide-scale implementation. The most-used method, reverse osmosis, pushes water through a membrane that keeps out the salt, a costly and energy-intensive process. By contrast, the battery method uses electricity to draw charged salt ions out of the water.
The researchers were inspired by sodium ion batteries, which contain salt water. Batteries have two chambers, a positive electrode and a negative electrode, with a separator in between that the ions can flow across. When the battery discharges, the sodium and chloride ions – the two elements of salt – are drawn to one chamber, leaving desalinated water in the other.
In a normal battery, the ions diffuse back when the current flows the other direction. The Illinois researchers had to find a way to keep the salt out of the now-pure water.
“In a conventional battery, the separator allows salt to diffuse from the positive electrode into the negative electrode,” Smith said. “That limits how much salt depletion can occur. We put a membrane that blocks sodium between the two electrodes, so we could keep it out of the side that's desalinated.”
See a video of how it works on YouTube.
The battery approach holds several advantages over reverse osmosis. The battery device can be small or large, adapting to different applications, while reverse osmosis plants must be very large to be efficient and cost effective, Smith said. The pressure required to pump the water through is much less, since it's simply flowing the water over the electrodes instead of forcing it through a membrane. This translates to much smaller energy needs, close to the very minimum required by nature, which in turn translates to lower costs. In addition, the rate of water flowing through it can be adjusted more easily than other types of desalination technologies that require more complex plumbing.
Smith and Dmello conducted a modeling study to see how their device might perform with salt concentrations as high as seawater, and found that it could recover an estimated 80 percent of desalinated water. Their simulations don't account for other contaminants in the water, however, so they are working toward running experiments with real seawater.
“We believe there's a lot of promise,” Smith said. “There's a lot of work that's gone on in developing new materials for sodium ion batteries. We hope our work could spur researchers in that area to investigate new materials for desalination. We're excited to see what kind of doors this might open.”

A lot rides on FEMA's flood maps: zoning laws, land use, building codes, tens of billions of dollars in disaster relief, and the basic sense of safety that comes with knowing where the water will and won't be during a storm. And one other thing: the entire flood insurance industry. But using these flood maps is like betting at the racetrack with a fifty-year-old form. They're based on what was, not what will be.
“FEMA flood zone maps are essentially a matter of the past,” says Klaus Jacob, a climate disaster expert at Columbia University. “[The agency was] never asked by Congress to look forward.”
After the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 — the most destructive in U.S. history, in which more than 640,000 people were displaced by thirty-foot floodwaters — private insurance companies stopped selling flood insurance for forty years.
“And then the developers and the banks said, ‘Whoa, hey, what's going on? We can't build any more houses — we can't give them mortgages if there is no coverage,' ” says Jacob. In 1968, the federal government created the National Flood Insurance Program. Five years later, Congress passed a law requiring the NFIP to make maps of flood zones. Anyone living in those zones with a federally backed mortgage would have to buy flood insurance. That worked for roughly another forty years.
“Then in 2005 we had Katrina, along with four other major hurricanes, and the NFIP went into a lot of debt,” explains Andrew Martin, who heads FEMA's risk analysis branch for the New York region. “Like, $17 billion to 18 billion in debt.”
Congress passed the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which jacked up premiums to close the gap. But “people started seeing pretty quick increases,” Martin says, and so in 2014 Congress acted to cap them. Michael Grimm, then a Staten Island congressman, co-sponsored the House bill (roughly 65 percent of the borough's residents own their homes) while New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez sponsored the Senate version.
Sandy made the costs of this approach painfully clear. When the storm hit, FEMA hadn't updated its flood insurance rate maps for New York City since 1983, and thousands of homes mapped outside of flood zones were inundated. Sandy cost the NFIP $8.5 billion. By the end of 2014, the program's debt had risen to $24 billion.
“It's ultimately, if you are cynical, protecting banks and their mortgages rather than the population,” Jacob says.
While the Department of Buildings continues to use the maps — all new or renovated structures must be two feet above FEMA's base flood elevations — the city has challenged them, claiming that FEMA's estimates are incorrect. Martin says that FEMA is waiting on its own report from a panel of independent experts due in mid-October.
“I think we need to find a way as a country to divorce ourselves from this idea that insurance maps, where you buy a one-year insurance policy, should somehow guide investing for thirty years, forty years, fifty years, beyond that,” says Dan Zarrilli, the city's chief resilience officer.
Story highlights Student hit police officer with officer's own baton, university says
University says Cpl. Christopher Carter now on administrative leave
Police: Campus officer said Robert Cameron Redus struggled with him
Friends: Redus was co-valedictorian of Christian high school
Those who know him call him the "gentlest person," but campus police said Monday that a 23-year-old student at a San Antonio-area Christian college took an officer's police baton and struck him before the officer fatally shot him.
There is no dashboard video available, according to the university.
The incident began when Cpl. Christopher Carter, a police officer with the University of the Incarnate Word in Alamo Heights, saw Robert Cameron Redus near campus "driving erratically at a high rate of speed" Friday, a university statement said.
"Carter was obligated to pull the suspect over to ensure the public's safety," the statement said.
Redus pulled into an apartment complex, and Carter followed, mistakenly reporting the wrong street location to police dispatchers, which prompted his call to be routed from the Alamo Heights Police Department to its San Antonio counterparts, the statement said. This caused a delay of several minutes in response time.
"During the wait for assistance, the officer tried to restrain the suspect who repeatedly resisted," the statement said. "During the struggle, the officer attempted to subdue the suspect with his baton. ... The baton was taken by the suspect who used it to hit the officer.
"The officer drew his firearm and was able to knock the baton from the suspect who continued to resist arrest. Shots were fired."
Redus did not identify himself, the university said, and there is "no evidence" the officer knew he was a student or where Redus lived.
University police vehicles are typically equipped with dashboard cameras, but Carter's vehicle joined the fleet two days before the incident, and its camera fell off the next day when a temperature change prevented the glue from setting, the school said.
"Officers had made arrangements to have it remounted," the statement said.
Carter, who has "an extensive law enforcement background," has been placed on administrative leave -- standard procedure in these types of incidents, a university statement said, adding that all campus officers "are licensed and trained as certified peace officers by the state of Texas."
Friends at the school say the Cameron Redus they know isn't the type to attack police.
They knew a student who made the dean's list at the Catholic college and had been co-valedictorian of a Christian high school back home in Baytown, Texas. They knew a fun-loving campus television news anchor who was "the sweetest, kindest, gentlest person," as friend Annie Jones described him to CNN affiliate WOAI-TV
A resident of Redus' apartment complex, 22-year-old Mohammad Haidarasl, told the San Antonio Express-News that Redus was his upstairs neighbor.
Haidarasl told the paper he was on his apartment sofa at 2 a.m. when he heard noise outside, and a voice he believes to have been the officer's saying, "Stop resisting, stop resisting."
The newspaper quoted Haidarasl as saying he thought he heard a struggle and "Then the cop said, 'I'm going to shoot.' "
A male voice replied, " 'Oh, you're gonna shoot me?' like sarcastic almost," Haidarasl said.
Less than a minute later, he said, he heard shots.
Alamo Heights police acknowledged the officer fired several shots. But they would not discuss other details of the alleged struggle, citing the ongoing investigation.
The university said it was awaiting the results of the Alamo Heights police probe, which is being conducted with assistance from the Texas Rangers.
Redus' family released a statement to CNN affiliate KENS-TV saying, "We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time."
University President Lou Agnese said in a statement released to WOAI, "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident."
The university released a statement saying it, too, "is deeply upset over the loss of life regardless of the circumstances." It further said this was the first shooting in university history.
Hundreds of people, including relatives of Redus, gathered at the university's convocation center Saturday for a vigil. Students brought a slideshow of Redus in happy poses.
"It makes me feel better that we've got a lot of support for Cameron," classmate Albert Salinas said outside the event in an interview with CNN affiliate KSAT-TV.
But they left with no better idea of what happened to their friend.

Promoter Tom Loeffler said Wednesday that WBA/IBO middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin wants to concentrate on unifying the titles in that division, provided he gets by Daniel Geale in Madison Square Garden July 26.
That means Golovkin has his eyes on Miguel Cotto (WBC), Peter Quillin (WBO) and Sam Soliman (IBF).
"It's important to unify because there's all these fighters who don't want to fight Gennady," Loeffler said. "This would give them one less reason not to."
Loeffler also said Golovkin and his family will move to Santa Monica soon, where he held a workout and press conference Wednesday, and that he hopes to stage some of Golovkin's fights in the Los Angeles area. A logical spot would be the refurbished Forum, who drew over 12,000 in May ffor Juan Manuel Marquez's victory over Mike Alvarado.
Golovkin already trains at Big Bear Lake, which is either two or 10 hours east of Los Angeles depending on when you choose to drive.
None of Golovkin's fights have gone to the 12th round before. He is 29-0 with 26 knockouts. But he predicted his fight with Geale "will go 12 rounds. He's too good a fighter."
"Geale beat two Germans in Germany," said Abel Sanchez, Golovkin's trainer. "That's all you need to know."
Loeffler had heard Golden Boy President Oscar De La Hoya nominate Golovkin as a possible oppoennt for Saul "Canelo" Alvarez, after Canelo decisioned Erislandy Lara Saturday night. Loeffler called it "very intreresting" and pointed out that negotiations or a fight with either Canelo or Quillin will be easier since De La Hoya is solely in charge of Golden Boy.

"Hellboy II has great reviews," my friend argued. He knew I was loath to spend $12 for a movie ticket to spend two hours watching trash. I checked the internet, and he was right. Critics lauded the film. On Rotten Tomatoes, 89 percent of the top critics found the movie favorable. The tacit endorsement of an internet review aggregator was all I needed. My friends and I headed out to the movie theater, bought our tickets and overpriced snack bar fare, and watched the film.
And it sucked.
To borrow from The Simpsons, the film was so formulaic it "could have spewed from the power book of the laziest Hollywood hack." Hellboy II: The Golden Army had enough lazy tropes and predictable plot twists for the entire 2008 summer season, let alone one movie.
There's a brooding protagonist longing for acceptance he knows he can never truly have. There's an antagonist who makes the high school sophomore-level insight that humans are the true monster (never heard that before). There's a newly pregnant girlfriend acting crazy because hormones. There's truly love ultimately conquering all. And there's a host of other attributes that made the movie not worth the price of admission. Once the credits rolled, I parted ways with Hollywood. I haven't stepped in a movie theater since.
Judging by Hollywood's recent luck — or lack thereof — I was ahead of the curve.
Hollywood is mired in a terrible summer, its worst in eight years. Box office sales are down 20 percent in the United States, and according to the Hollywood Reporter, no movie surpassed the $300 million mark for the first time since 2011. It's estimated that summer 2014 will draw 15-20 percent less money for Hollywood than summer 2013, and such a dramatic decline over the course of 365 days hasn't been seen in over 30 years.
Why didn't those movies sell? Why didn't people go out to see them? Are people just smartening up and realizing mainstream entertainment is trash? Or is there something more at work?
The first explanation is the ever-present bogeyman of internet piracy. The New Republic recently published an article highlighting piracy's prominence as the sole reason for not only Hollywood's declining numbers, but for the film industry's penchant for peddling generic crap. Each month, more than 300 million users download content off BitTorrent alone — and most of these downloads occur in the United States, a place where it's easy to purchase movies. In January of last year, 25 percent of all internet users sought to download copyrighted content.
So Hollywood is dead because you're just too cheap to pay for it? Hardly. If the popularity of Netflix is anything to judge by, users are happy to pay for content they deem to be fairly priced and worthwhile. Even though Game of Thrones is the most pirated show ever, it's also HBO's most legitimately viewed show (as in viewed by people with subscriptions to HBO and HBO Go). People will pay if they feel they're getting value for money.
In regards to Hollywood's current summer slate, customers voted with their wallets. They don't want what Hollywood is offering, in part because its continuously catering to a demographic losing interest in the movies.
That brings us to another explanation: Some believe Hollywood's predilection for all things testosterone-laden is causing the downturn. As Kelly Faircloth of Jezebel glibly put it, "If you essentially ignore half the population, you're leaving money on the table."
The numbers paint a clear picture: "Females made up only 39 percent of Amazing Spider-Man 2's debut audience, compared with 42 percent for 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man and 46 percent for Spider-Man 3. The same trend applies to Transformers. This summer's Age of Extinction skewed 64 percent male during its first weekend, more than the previous two films, and it played the oldest."
Women are not interested in seeing movies so generically masculine they're tantamount to a two-hour Dr. Pepper Ten commercial. Summer 2014 was so brutal because Hollywood ignored the most protiftable demographic — not because of The Pirate Bay.
Competition with other forms of entertainment is also a considerable factor in Hollywood's downturn. YouTube is soaring in popularity, and one Minecraft-related YouTube channel has more subscribers than Katy Perry or Justin Bieber. There's also the recent prominence of Twitch, the gaming-related video network Google might be purchasing for $1 billion. Furthermore, television is often said to be in a "golden age" — as shows like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad,and Girls garner more artistic clout than many movies. Then, of course, there's Netflix.
Why go to the movies when you can watch your favorite YouTube star or marathon your favorite show? There's no reason to, and people are starting to realize that.
Hollywood is turning to Big Data to mitigate the problem, but this will only enhance what's wrong with movies. As The Atlantic's Derek Thompson noted, thanks to Big Data "Hollywood has become sensational at predicting what its audiences want to see. And, ironically, for that very reason, it's become better at making relentlessly average movies."
Hollywood does not need piracy's help in tying a noose around its neck. It was already doing that thanks to the insights offered by Big Data: Make everything generic as possible to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, hence an endless parade of superhero movies — hence average, generic, less ambitious films that are OK because OK is all they need.
While the world's hottest video mediums offer the bold, Hollywood offers the bland. If Hollywood dies, the industry has no one to blame but itself.

At a time when several other bids have seen their stadium plans derailed, Nashville's MLS bid continues to quietly strengthen its position as a leading candidate.
Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam approved and signed House Bill 6/Senate Bill 3, adding MLS to an existing state statute that allows the use of state sales tax collected at NFL, NBA, and NHL venues to help cover stadium expenses. The bill places MLS on equal footing with the other major sports with respect to state funding, and is a huge step in the stadium-building process for Nashville.
“Today was a major step forward for the movement to bring Major League Soccer to Nashville,” said MLS2Nashville co-founder Will Alexander. “This law puts MLS on the same footing in Tennessee as the National Football League, National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association. Nashville continues to make a strong case that our city belongs in MLS, and this bill demonstrates our state's leadership shares that view.”
The question of funding, particularly when concerned with a public-private partnership, has derailed several MLS bids to date. The St. Louis bid, headed by the SC STL group, saw their funding vote rejected earlier in 2017, essentially ending its hopes. The Charlotte bid has been beleaguered by a lack of political interest and funding concerns from the start. The Detroit bid has been unable to acquire the land it desires for a stadium site. Most recently, San Diego's city council voted against a special 2017 ballot to approve land use at the Qualcomm Stadium site, leaving that bid out to dry until the 2018 ballot.
Along with Nashville, Tampa/St. Petersburg, led by the USL's Tampa Bay Rowdies, and Sacramento, led by the USL's Republic, have also had stadium funding approved. With a soccer-specific stadium deemed a necessity in this round of expansion, that places these three cities at the forefront of the discussion.
In a new report from Pro Publica, Facebook apologized for inconsistently policing hate speech on its platform. Pro Publica reporters submitted 49 samples of posts from users who believed moderators made the wrong call, either by removing legitimate expression or by allowing hate speech to remain online. In 22 of those cases, Facebook admitted its content reviewers made the wrong call. Acknowledging the mistakes, Vice President Justin Osofsky promised to double the size of its content review team to 20,000 in 2018.
When a dozen people flagged the Facebook group “Jewish Ritual Murder,” the site claimed there was no violation of its community standards. Similarly, when another user flagged a meme with “the only good Muslim is a fucking dead one,” displayed over the body of a man who'd been shot in the head, they were told, via an automated message: “We looked over the photo, and though it doesn't go against one of our specific Community Standards, we understand that it may still be offensive to you and others.”

Facebook later reversed both decisions after Pro Publica submitted them, as part of its report.
“We're sorry for the mistakes we have made — they do not reflect the community we want to help build,” Osofsky told Pro Publica in a statement. “We must do better. Our policies allow content that may be controversial and at times even distasteful, but it does not cross the line into hate speech. This may include criticism of public figures, religions, professions, and political ideologies.”
A disturbing report from the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday profiling content moderators found that workers across Silicon Valley are given only a few minutes to review flagged items. That time may not enable moderators to develop a clear, consistent logic for hate speech or to clearly distinguish between critiquing a religion (which is protected) and attacking one (which is not).

Facebook, like Twitter, Youtube, et al, must confront two serious issues. The first is scale. With two billion users, the amount of flagged content to review is immense. At present, there's no sustainable way for Facebook to scale its moderation efforts with how many content users produce. Silicon Valley is turning to algorithms to help, but nothing indicates that machines will be a quick fix.
Second, Facebook has long valorized content-neutrality and the First Amendment, essentially saying platforms should be laissez-faire in policing content unless absolutely necessary. This leads to vague and murky rules on hate speech, because they're designed to trigger as little direct intervention from the platform as possible. How does minimal intervention work at this scale? It doesn't, and Facebook knows it. Charlottesville's debate on platform accountability was the first reckoning for hazily defined rules on hate speech, and reports like Pro Publica's tease that many more are to come.

How ironic. Not content with searching for life on Mars, the Russian space agency and the US-based Planetary Society will soon be sending terrestrial life to the Martian moon Phobos. The mini-interplanetary travellers will consist of bacteria, spores, seeds, crustaceans, insects and fungi. Why? To see how biological life, in various forms, deals with space travel spanning three years.
So if you thought that a human (or monkey) would be the first of Earth's ambassadors to land on Mars or one of its moons, you'd be very mistaken…
Russia has been carrying out a variety of biological space tests to see how life deals with the hazards of spaceflight recently. In one experiment carried out in collaboration with Japanese scientists, a mosquito was attached to the hull of the International Space Station (ISS) to see… what would happen.
The mosquito was a part of the Biorisk project, and the scientists knew the insect had the ability to drop into a “suspended animation” during times of draught in Africa. The African mosquito can turn its bodily water into tricallosa sugar, slowing its functions nearly to a stop. When the rain returns, the crystallised creature is rehydrated and it can carry on its lifecycle. The Biorisk mosquito however survived 18 months with no sustenance, exposed to temperatures ranging from -150°C to +60°C. When returned to Earth, Russian scientists gave the hardy mozzie a health check, declaring:
“We brought him back to Earth. He is alive, and his feet are moving.” — Anatoly Grigoryev, Vice President of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Was this insect cruelty of the most extreme kind, or did it serve a purpose? Actually, the mosquito experiment provided an insight to a biological specimen after being exposed to cosmic rays for long periods, and it also showed us that the African mosquito's natural ability to slip into a defensive coma, only to be revived and appear to be healthy (that is, if it was more than just its feet moving – there was no indication as to whether the little guy was successfully re-integrated into mosquito society). Perhaps the lessons learned from this small test may go to some way of helping us realise the potential for putting future interplanetary astronauts into some kind of biological stasis.
So that's the idea behind sending creatures into space: we need to understand how animals and plants deal with space travel. This will aid the understanding of how humans will cope in space for long periods, plus we need to understand if there are any harmful effects from growing foodstuffs away from our planet. This is why the Russian space agency wants to go one step further when it launches its Phobos-Grunt mission next year, to send biological specimens on a voyage of a lifetime. A return trip to the Martian moon Phobos.
On board, it is hoped the US-based Planetary Society will be able to send a small package filled with 10 different species including tardigrades (“water bears”), seeds and bacteria. The main purpose of this experiment will be to test the panspermia hypothesis, where it is thought that life may travel from planet to planet, hitching a ride on fragments of planetary material. Most of the biological samples will be in a dormant state (i.e. the plant spores), and tests will be carried out when Phobos-Grunt returns to Earth to see if the bacteria survived, seeds germinate and spores… do what ever spores do.
Russia on the other hand has far loftier goals; the space agency will attach a small petting zoo. Inside the Russian experiment will include crustaceans, mosquito larvae (already proven to be enthusiastic space travellers), bacteria and fungi. The Russian experiment will specifically look at how cosmic radiation can effect these different types of life during an interplanetary trip (essential ahead of any manned attempt to the Red Planet).
Naturally, there are some concerns about contamination to the moon (if Phobos-Grunt doesn't do the “return” part of the mission), but the chances of any extraterrestrial life being harboured on this tiny piece of airless rock are low. Having said that, we just don't know, so the mission scientists will have to be very careful to ensure containment. Besides, there's something unsettling about infecting an alien world with our bacteria before we've even had the chance to get there ourselves…

Welfare benefits for the sick and unemployed would rise, Mr. Olovsson said, and with more investment in education, teacher numbers and salaries would increase while class sizes went down. This would be funded with a modest rise in taxes on the better off, a doubling of the value added tax on restaurants and a new levy on Sweden's banks, which largely avoided the agonies of the European financial sector. Otherwise, he said, there would be no new taxes on business.
Sweden's forecast economic growth of 1.9 percent this year masks underlying weaknesses. Unemployment has remained stuck around 8 percent, and much higher among the young. The central bank made a surprise cut to interest rates last month in response to signs of deflation.
There is cross-party consensus that schools are in a mess after a report last year from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showing a sharp drop in the global rankings of Sweden's educational system. In health and elderly care, high-profile scandals have fueled anxiety that the experiment with private sector providers has gone too far. There is a chronic shortage of housing in the big cities, which has driven up rents and personal debt.
“Definitely the shift to the right in public opinion that occurred in 2010 is gone, we can see this very clearly,” said Prof. Henrik Oscarsson, director of the SOM Institute for opinion research at the University of Gothenburg.
Swedish politics are like a thermostat, he said — the dial on tax cuts has been turned up, but now the temperature is uncomfortable, there are problems in the welfare system and people want the dial adjusted.
A Highland Park resident who owned a haircutting salon on York Boulevard near the border of Eagle Rock has moved a few stores west to a corner location that's a lot more visible and has been attracting more customers than ever before.
Panfilo Cruz, who owns New York Cuts, relocated the salon to 4581 York Blvd. earlier this month after 15 years. A flower shop used to be located on the spot, and when that closed this past summer, Cruz decided to move his salon into the empty space.
Freshly painted in red, white and blue, the salon sits on the northwest corner of Avenue 46, where it has been relatively getting more attention, according to Steven Cruz, Panfilo's son, who's a hairdresser there.
"He's a star, Steven," said Panfilo of his son, adding that the young man won a citywide hair-cutting contest in 2006.
A family owned business, New York Cuts offers haircuts for men ($14), women and children, specializing in men's fades and designs. The salon has a friendly, laid-back atmosphere, not least because several of the hairdressers are Steven's longtime friends. They're local residents who are paid employees but treated like family, Steven said.
Panfilo owns several buildings on the stretch of York Boulevard where New York Cuts is located, including the salon's former location. He's planning to open a grooming store in the salon's former location.

September is the ninth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the third of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the fourth of five months to have a length of less than 31 days. In the Northern Hemisphere September is the seasonal equivalent of March in the Southern Hemisphere.
In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological autumn is on 1 September. In the Southern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological spring is on 1 September.[1]
September marks the beginning of the ecclesiastical year in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is the start of the academic year in many countries, in which children go back to school after the summer break, sometimes on the first day of the month.
September (from Latin septem, "seven") was originally the seventh of ten months on the oldest known Roman calendar, with March (Latin Martius) the first month of the year until perhaps as late as 153 BC.[2] After the calendar reform that added January and February to the beginning of the year, September became the ninth month, but retained its name. It had 29 days until the Julian reform, which added a day.
Ancient Roman observances for September include Ludi Romani, originally celebrated from September 12 to September 14, later extended to September 5 to September 19. In the 1st century BC, an extra day was added in honor of the deified Julius Caesar on 4 September. Epulum Jovis was held on September 13. Ludi Triumphales was held from September 18–22. The Septimontium was celebrated in September, and on December 11 on later calendars. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. In 1752, the British Empire adopted the Gregorian calendar. In the British Empire that year, September 2 was immediately followed by September 14.
September was called "harvest month" in Charlemagne's calendar.[3] September corresponds partly to the Fructidor and partly to the Vendémiaire of the first French republic.[3] On Usenet, it is said that September 1993 (Eternal September) never ended. September is called Herbstmonat, harvest month, in Switzerland.[3] The Anglo-Saxons called the month Gerstmonath, barley month, that crop being then usually harvested.[3]
September in Astronomy and Astrology [ edit ]
Meteor showers that occur in September include the Aurigids, the Delta Aurigids which occur from mid-September to early October, the Southern Taurids, which occur from September 10 to November 20, and the Andromedids which occur from September 25 – December 25.
The September equinox takes place in this month, and certain observances are organized around it. It is the Autumn equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Vernal Equinox in the Southern Hemisphere. The dates can vary from 21 September to 24 September (in UTC).
September is mostly in the sixth month of the astrological calendar (and the first part of the seventh), which begins at the end of March/Mars/Aries.

CLEVELAND, Ohio – A Saturday morning homicide on Cleveland's East Side has brought the city's 12-hour death toll to seven.
Officers found two men shot to death in a car about 5 a.m. near East 102nd Street and Marah Avenue after witnesses told police the car crashed into a fence.
Investigators found bullet casings in the backseat, police said.
The victims, 34 and 22 years old, have not been identified but are believed to be related, police spokesman Sgt. Ali Pillow said.
Five people were murdered and a 9-year-old girl was shot Friday night in a multiple homicide at a home at 1443 East 92nd Street.
Police have not identified suspects in either case.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Cleveland Division of Police Homicide Unit at 216-623-5464.
In 1966, at a time when the perception of women wearing pants was considered off-kilter and inappropriate, Yves Saint Laurent introduced the world to Le Smoking, a tuxedo-style suit that quickly became the epitome of sex appeal. Though today we view the iconic look as an interesting alternative to the LBD, it signifies more than a party outfit: It's a statement for women. Because of this, and admittedly because we've been dreaming of finding the perfect tuxedo to wear on New Year's Eve, we gathered five fun facts about Le Smoking. Scroll down to check them out, and shop our tuxedo jacket picks too!

Shot for French Vogue in 1975, the story featured an androgynous woman standing in a hazily lit Parisian alleyway, hair slicked back, crisp white cravat, cigarette, entwined with a model dressed only in black stilettos. With stark monochrome simplicity, Newton created a piece of iconography that to this day has never gone out of fashion."

Saint Laurent has a great respect for women, and so he should; without them, he would be out of business. At every stage of the making of a suit, a house model tries it on to show Saint Laurent how the garment works in action. The suit must work on the body, allowing freedom of movement, otherwise it is altered until it does.”

Nan Kempner was famously turned away from Le Côte Basque in New York while wearing her YSL tuxedo suit. Yet in the defiant style befitting of this androgynous, no-nonsense look, she removed the bottom half and waltzed into the restaurant wearing the jacket as a thigh-skimming mini dress instead. The manager later said that for formal dining attire trousers were as unsuitable as a bathing suit."

He has taken on drugs, crime and corruption in Baltimore; and brutalised young soldiers in Iraq. Now David Simon, the creator of the hit TV series The Wire, is to create a drama that treats Hurricane Katrina as an allegory for the financial, social and cultural disasters that have shaken the US over the past year.
The series, called Treme, after a New Orleans neighbourhood, was commissioned by HBO earlier this month after a successful pilot, and will air in the US in 2010. Filming will start later this year – after the hurricane season abates. The 10- or 12-part drama will be, Simon told the Guardian, "an allegory for the trauma that the country as a whole went through two years later".
"The fact is that the levees on the canals were substandard, and done on the cheap at an immense profit. Ultimately that becomes a metaphor," he said. "New Orleans was relying on things that were believed to be genuine bulwarks against tragedy and disaster. People felt that there were similar bulwarks protecting our financial institutions and foreign policy. Now, two years on, we are all essentially in the same boat as New Orleans. Katrina was an outlyer of where we are today."
Simon, whose The Wire has been hailed as a masterpiece of novelistic, sophisticated television was speaking to the Guardian ahead of his appearance at the Guardian Hay festival, which opens tomorrow. Simon will be speaking at the festival on 30 May about his book The Corner, an account by him and his collaborator, Ed Burns, of a year spent observing life on the street in West Baltimore. The book, published in the US in 1997, became the basis of The Wire, along with Homicide, Simon's earlier book about the year he spent shadowing officers in the Baltimore Police Department.
Homicide was first published in the US in 1992, and The Corner came out in 1997 – but it is only now, after the wildfire success of The Wire, that the works are receiving attention in the UK, after publisher Canongate picked them up, republishing Homicide last year and The Corner last month.
Simon said his late-flowering literary success in Britain was "remarkable. Homicide was published very briefly in the UK in the 1990s, when it sold about 11 copies ... the UK has been very kind to The Wire."
Simon was a reporter at the Baltimore Sun when he took leave of absence to work with former police officer Burns on The Corner, an example of what he called "stand around and watch" journalism – slow-burn reporting that almost became ethnography. "The story changes the longer you stay in one place. After two weeks your view of the situation and people changes. After two months it might completely turn around. I did care for those people – and I wanted their lives to end better than in many cases they did."
The work is a lovingly detailed account of the lives of richly complex characters such as Gary McCullough, a former businessman whose life has become chaotic after becoming ensnared by heroin addiction; and his ex-wife Fran, a junkie who struggles to cling on to the vestiges of family life. It is a trenchantly political work, for it declines to see these otherwise overlooked people as mere statistics, but gives them vivid, human life.
And, despite his avowed admiration for Obama, Simon believes the new regime will do nothing to solve the US's drugs problems. "I do not believe that we have the stomach for serious change," he said. "The war on drugs is as disastrous as any government policy has been over the past 50 years, but I do not believe Obama and his people will use their political capital to end it ... If a policy failed this unequivocally in any other part of US life you would cashier the generals. But the drug problem oppresses the poor. If rich kids were wandering the streets stealing car radios we would not be so complacent. But it is easier to brutalise the poor and discard them. We are not a manufacturing economy any more and we don't need our least educated people, so we marginalise them. The cynicism of Reagan and Thatcher still applies."
On Treme, Simon said: "It picks up three months after the storm, and will deliver a story of people trying to pick up their lives and culture again. New Orleans is one of the most extraordinary cultural creations in the US in terms of almost every artform – and it is very vulnerable. The characters have to find their way back and try to solve the existential crisis that Katrina has left them."
The show will be, he said, a "homage to one of America's greatest achievements, African-American music. A thousand years from now, if anyone is talking about anything on this rotating orb, and they mention America, they might talk about constitutional government or democracy or baseball – but they will surely talk about blues and jazz. New Orleans is the cradle of all that."
The Guardian Hay festival this year foregrounds major religious figures. Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, will speak to AN Wilson; and Desmond Tutu will deliver a lecture. Major literary figures speaking include Alan Bennett; the Swedish thriller writer Henning Mankell; novelists Anne Michaels, Rose Tremain and Sarah Waters; and poets Simon Armitage and Carol Ann Duffy, the new poet laureate.
The science programme homes in on the politics of climate change, with highlights including Nicholas Stern and Anthony Giddens. The Guardian Hay festival runs from tomorrow until 31 May.
A newly apportioned state Republican representative in Wyoming is standing by claims he made at the height of the AIDS panic in a book entitled The Death Sentence of AIDS: Vital Information For You and Your Family's Health and Safety.
Among the more outlandish claims in the book, which was self-published by Rep. Troy Mader (R-Gillette) in 1984, are that “[h]omosexuals…purposely infected women to pass AIDS infection into the straight population,” and that “[m]any homosexuals demand the right to have sexual acts with children of any age, including infants.”
In an interview with The Star-Tribune, Rep. Mader said that while some of the research in the book was “a little outdated,” that's only because AIDS was still poorly understood by the medical community at the time.
However, excerpts from the book published by The Star-Tribune do not concern science so much as the existence of a vast homosexual conspiracy designed to force America to commit “national suicide” via promiscuity.
“There are admitted homosexuals in congress [sic] as well as in many other branches of government,” he wrote. Moreover, “congress [sic] has many members that are sympathetic to the homosexual cause.” This coalition exists because “[h]omosexuals have very strong, well-financed political activists who are constantly attempting to get legislation passed in favor of homosexual/lesbian rights.”
In the book, Mader extensively quoted from Gene Antonio, author of The AIDS Cover-Up?: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS and AIDS: A Weapon in the Hands of Militant Homosexuals. While he told The Star-Tribune that he merely quoted “what the experts recommended at the time,” he did not address whether he still believes, for example, that “[m]any homosexuals demand the right to kill themselves with the AIDS virus and to kill others by infecting them.”
He did, however, say that he still believes “the real problem in homosexuality is the promiscuity,” which is the means by which “homosexuals” will help America commit “national suicide.”

Are too many of our most talented people choosing careers in finance – and, more specifically, in trading, speculating, and other allegedly “unproductive” activities?
In the United States, 7.4% of total compensation of employees in 2012 went to people working in the finance and insurance industries. Whether or not that percentage is too high, the real issue is that the share is even higher among the most educated and accomplished people, whose activities may be economically and socially useless, if not harmful.
In a survey of elite US universities, Catherine Rampell found that in 2006, just before the financial crisis, 25% of graduating seniors at Harvard University, 24% at Yale, and a whopping 46% at Princeton were starting their careers in financial services. Those percentages have fallen somewhat since, but this might be only a temporary effect of the crisis.
According to a study by Thomas Philippon and Ariell Reshef, much of the increase in financial activity has taken place in the more speculative fields, at the expense of traditional finance. From 1950 to 2006, credit intermediation (lending, including traditional banking) declined relative to “other finance” (including securities, commodities, venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, trusts, and other investment activities like investment banking). Moreover, wages in “other finance” skyrocketed relative to those in credit intermediation.
We surely need some people in trading and speculation. But how do we know whether we have too many?
To some people, the question is a moral one. Trading against others is regarded as an inherently selfish pursuit, even if it might have indirect societal benefits. But, as economists like to point out, traders and speculators provide a useful service. They sort through information about businesses and (at least some of the time) try to judge their real worth. They are thus helping to allocate society's resources to the best uses – that is, to the most promising businesses.
But these people's activities also impose costs on the rest of us. Indeed, a 2011 paper by Patrick Bolton, Tano Santos, and José Scheinkman argues that a significant amount of speculation and deal-making is pure rent-seeking. In other words, it is wasteful activity that achieves nothing more than enabling the collection of rents on items that might otherwise be free.
The classic example of rent-seeking is that of a feudal lord who installs a chain across a river that flows through his land and then hires a collector to charge passing boats a fee (or rent of the section of the river for a few minutes) to lower the chain. There is nothing productive about the chain or the collector. The lord has made no improvements to the river and is helping nobody in any way, directly or indirectly, except himself. All he is doing is finding a way to make money from something that used to be free. If enough lords along the river follow suit, its use may be severely curtailed.
Those in “other finance” often engage in similar behavior. They skim the best business deals, creating a “negative externality” on those who are not party to them. If the bad assets that they reject – for example, the subprime mortgage securities that fueled the 2008 financial crisis – are created anyway and foisted on less knowledgeable investors, financiers contribute no more to society than a lord who installs a chain across a river.
In a forthcoming paper, Patrick Bolton extends this view to look at bankers and at the Glass-Steagall Act, which forbade commercial banks from engaging in a wide variety of activities classified as “investment banking.” Ever since the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 repealed Glass-Steagall, bankers have acted increasingly like feudal lords. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 introduced a measure somewhat similar to the Glass-Steagall prohibition by imposing the Volcker Rule, which bars proprietary trading by commercial banks, but much more could be done.
To many observers, Glass-Steagall made no sense. Why shouldn't banks be allowed to engage in any business they want, at least as long as we have regulators to ensure that the banks' activities do not jeopardize the entire financial infrastructure?
In fact, the main advantages of the original Glass-Steagall Act may have been more sociological than technical, changing the business culture and environment in subtle ways. By keeping the deal-making business separate, banks may have focused more on their traditional core business.
Bolton and his colleagues seem to be right in many respects, though economic research has not yet permitted us to estimate the value to society of so many of our best and brightest making their careers in the currently popular kinds of “other finance.” Speculative activities have plusses and minuses, much that is good and some that is bad, and these are very difficult to quantify. We need to be very careful about regulations that impinge on such activities, but we should not shy away from making regulations once we have clarity.
Airport Security
Article by Editor of icelandair Explorer
It is certainly no secret that due to the events in America just over
a month ago, that the tourist industry and associated businesses around the
world, have, and in many cases continue to feel the impact. The losses in
terms of real dollars is staggering and while just now starting to recover,
ever so slowly, it will most likely be months before things completely
return to normal, if they ever completely do.
The tragedy in and of itself has been analyzed to death by every
reporter for every and news service around the world. We thought
that at Iceland Explorer we'd like to take a different approach and look at
it from a different angle.
Safety and security at airports and on airplanes around the world has
never been better. The bad part of this is that in some cases it took
something like this to insure it. The next question is how long will it
last? We would hope forever and there is no reason with all of the state of
the art equipment available today that it cannot. That I believe will be
the future concern of the traveling and especially flying public. With
that in mind, we thought we would have a look at security at the airport,
then and now. Since there is a domestic airport in Reykjavik but more
importantly an international airport in Keflavik, we asked for and received
a complete briefing and an escorted look around for ourselves. It's no
secret that security has been increased and heightened everywhere as a
result of terrorism. What we found was that while there is now and will
continue to be increased awareness at International Airport, there
really haven't been that many major changes.
Why? Because at International, there didn't have to be.
Most of it was already in place BEFORE September 11th.
I have been traveling to and from Iceland for many years even before I
moved here. Thinking back, I have always been impressed by what I could
only perceive as a very safe and secure feeling without it ever being that
noticeable. It appears that through all these many years, right along with
ever increasing requirements and new technologies coming on-line, the
aircraft and airports of Iceland, are tops if not number one in both. Here
is what we observed.
First and foremost, we made our request for an interview and to have a
brief look-see for ourselves to write this story. That was met with an
immediate, courteous, can do attitude. To us, especially being reporters,
this indicated total dedication to a job taken very seriously and being
done very professionally. Score one for us; we were totally correct on all
counts.
We journeyed back to when it was essentially only people doing security.
Back then; it was the airport police and the customs and immigration folks.
That essentially was all that was necessary. There were standard and a few
special operations procedures. Iceland was considered a small island in the
middle of the mighty North Atlantic that was a convenient stop for flights
to just about everywhere else. There was the NATO military operation
sharing a terminal with what is now Icelandair and back then, a few others
Iceland owned and operated air carriers. Then, the new terminal was built
and opened on, at the time, Iceland's President, Vigdis Finnbogadottir´s
birthday; April 14th, 1987. At the time it was certainly the newest, not
the largest, but definitely the most beautifully constructed and appointed
airport terminal in all of Scandinavia. It was not the kind of airport
one would expect to see in a place called Iceland. Some we think, still
believe, or imagine, that an “airport terminal” in a place like Iceland
would be a ramp, with a parking spot for one airplane, maybe two on a good
day, a very small building with two doors marked in and out. In many cases,
that “thinking” or actually, lack of it, has its advantages.
For example, some independent individual, might just be thinking of trying
to get a “few illegal substances” into the USA or even into Europe. That
would be easy they would reason if they came on a flight that stopped in
Iceland. They'd most certainly be checked on a direct, non-stop flight in
either direction. Well, they would be wrong. About 98% of the time, those
trying to move illegal substances to, or through Iceland, never arrive at
their intended destination. We tell you that because 100% of the time, they
never know they've been found out until it's too late. That is an
un-intrusive system that works and works very well. Today, certainly at the
International Airport, airport security, airport customs and the
airport police are totally in tune with each other and work extremely well
together. There are sniffer dogs for every threat and possible event. There
is X-Ray equipment you never see, along with the security you do see. The
entire plan is extremely well thought out and designed by a top notch,
highly trained staff. It is years ahead of it's time compared to many,
probably most airports around the world. Even now, security
personnel will be increased by about 50% but that's about it. The idea is
to simply get passengers through the increased security necessities in
these times with minimum hassle, and the aircraft out on time to
destinations worldwide. Since September 11th, a total of TWO, that's
correct only two flights were delayed less than 15 minutes due to security.
That, simply stated, is outstanding.
There is a new system, a product of biometric technology, called “FACEIT”
now employed in the new terminal building. It is totally out of sight,
totally un-intrusive and it is very user friendly. That is unless you
happen to be on a watch list, anywhere in the world, for any reason. That
can be a person or persons known to be seeking illegal asylum, known credit
card or securities fogerers, a known illegal substance smuggler, yes, even
a known member of a terrorist cell or group we hear so much about these
days. You might not be meaning any harm, just as they say, “passing
through.” So be it, but at Keflavik International you won't pass far. The
system is almost 100% foolproof and upgrades itself all the time.
When the Civil Aviation Authority, the Federal Aviation Administration and
all airline industry groups such as the IACO and IATA “suggested” certain
protections be put in place, they were already up and running well at
Keflavik International. It is a model of security and people getting it
right. So, coming to Iceland is safe, secure and the unique beauty of the
country is second to none. Now is as good a time as any to consider coming.
We wait to welcome you.
Liberal comedian Bill Maher said President Clinton is at fault for the events that led to now-former FBI Director James Comey's firing.
Maher said on HBO that much of the controversy raised by Comey during the last months of his tenure can be traced to Clinton visiting then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch in Phoenix.
"Comey had to say what he did [in July 2016 about Hillary Clinton's email investigation] because the attorney general had to recuse herself because [Bill Clinton] walked on her plane," Maher said.
"Bill once again [expletive]'ed-up his wife's life," he remarked.
Maher said that if President Clinton hadn't boarded Lynch's plane on the Sky Harbor Airport tarmac for several minutes without a third party, Lynch would have held the harshly-criticized press conference instead of Comey.

At the July press conference Comey laid out the aggravating factors in the case against Secretary Clinton, but then recommended against prosecuting her for mishandling classified information.
Maher said that after Comey made a second statement prior to the election that the FBI was looking at Clinton-related emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's (D-N.Y.) laptop, Democrats wanted him out of his post.
He said such Democratic backlash against Comey gave President Trump a "talking point" after he effectively consented to their wishes and fired Comey last week.
"Let's put the blame where it belongs," Maher said.

U.S. President Donald Trump, in the first stop of his maiden trip abroad, received a regal welcome Saturday in Saudi Arabia, feted by the wealthy kingdom as he aims to forge strong alliances to combat terrorism while pushing past the multiple controversies threatening to engulf his young administration.
For one day, anyway, Trump appeared successful in keeping his domestic woes an ocean away, as he basked in the pageantry that began with an elaborate airport welcome ceremony punctuated by a military flyover and a handshake from Saudi King Salman.
Trump arrived in Riyadh besieged by the fallout from his firing of FBI Director James Comey and more revelations about the federal investigations into his election campaign's possible ties to Russia.
Trump and King Salman signed a series of agreements cementing their countries' military and economic partnerships. One is a military sales deal of about $110 billion US, taking effect effective immediately. Another $350-billion US arms deal is to play out over the next 10 years.

"That was a tremendous day. Tremendous investments in the United States," Trump said after a late day meeting with the Saudi crown prince.

The president briefly joined King Salman in a traditional male-only sword dance before a state dinner in his honour.
Swaying side to side, the president stood shoulder to shoulder with Saudis for the traditional dance, which includes drumming and singing.

The dance took place outside the King Abdulaziz Historical Centre where First Lady Melania Trump, son-in law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka will join Trump to dine with the Saudi king and other senior Saudi royals.
The menu is to include an array of dishes, including steak and ketchup alongside the lamb and hefty portions of rice.

The two nations released a joint statement in which they vowed to "dedicate themselves to strengthening their strategic partnership for the 21st century and to charting a renewed path toward a peaceful Middle East…"
They also announced a defence co-operation agreement and private sector agreements that are intended to create tens of thousands of new jobs in the U.S. defence industry.
"This package of defence equipment and services support the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of Iranian threats, while also bolstering the kingdom's ability to contribute to counter-terrorism operations across the region, reducing the burden on the U.S. military to conduct those operations," the White House said in a statement.

It praised the agreements as a way to expand opportunities for U.S. in the region and support "tens of thousands of new jobs in the U.S. defence industrial base."
To coincide with Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia announced it will open a digital centre to monitor the online activities of ISIS and other militant groups.
'Proud of this relationship'
"As you have heard us say often, we have to defeat ISIS on the battlefield, but we really have to defeat ISIS in cyberspace," U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a news briefing.
"This is their recruiting tool. This is how they message to lone wolves around the world," he said.

"We are proud of this relationship that we are embarking upon with the kingdom and are appreciative of the leadership of his Royal Highness King Salman in putting these initiatives forward," Tillerson said.
Tillerson said the agreements will serve the national security interests of both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia as they aim to "deter regional threats from Iran."
"We are closely co-ordinating our efforts in terms of how to to counter Iran's extremism, its exported extremism in particular, its support for foreign fighters, its payment of foreign fighters, its support of militia that are operating not only in Yemen, but in Iraq and in Syria," he said.
​Stops in Israel, Vatican City, Belgium, Italy
Trump is the only American president to make Saudi Arabia, or any majority Muslim country, his first stop overseas as president — a scheduling choice designed in part to show respect to the region after more than a year of anti-Muslim campaign rhetoric.
The president's stop in Saudi Arabia kicks off an ambitious international debut. After two days of meetings in Riyadh, Trump will travel to Israel, have an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican, and meet with allies at a NATO summit in Brussels and the Group of 7 wealthy nations in Sicily.

As he arrived, the president waved from the doorway of Air Force One and then descended the steps, joined by his wife, Melania. The 81-year-old King Salman, who used a cane for support, was brought to the steps of the plane on a golf cart. The two leaders exchanged pleasantries and Trump said it was "a great honour" to be there.
Several jets then flew overhead leaving a red, white and blue trail.
Trump also tweeted that it was "great" to be in Saudi Arabia.

White House officials hope the trip gives Trump the opportunity to recalibrate after one of the most difficult stretches of his young presidency. The White House badly bungled the president's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the federal investigation into possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. On Wednesday, the Justice Department relented to calls from Democrats to name a special counsel, tapping former FBI chief Robert Mueller to lead the probe.
Moments after Trump lifted off for Saudi Arabia, more reports stemming from the Russia investigation surfaced and threatened to overshadow the trip. The New York Times reported that Trump called Comey "a real nut job" while discussing the ongoing investigation with two Russian officials visiting the White House earlier this month. He also told them that firing Comey had "taken off" the "great pressure" he was feeling from the investigation, the Times reported.
Adviser 'person of interest' in Russia probe
Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that an unidentified senior Trump adviser was being considered a "person of interest" in the law enforcement investigation. In addition, Comey agreed to testify at an open hearing of the Senate intelligence committee in the near future, the panel said.
Despite his domestic troubles, Trump warm reception in Saudi Arabia may reflect that the kingdom's ruling family grew deeply frustrated with former U.S. president Barack Obama's detente with Iran and his restrained approach to the conflict in Syria.

Saudi Arabia's elaborate welcome included billboards featuring images of Trump and the king that dotted the highways of Riyadh, emblazoned with the motto "Together we prevail." Trump's luxury hotel was bathed in red, white and blue lights and, at times, an image of the president's face.

Melania Trump wore a black pantsuit with a golden belt and did not cover her head for the arrival, consistent with custom for foreign dignitaries visiting Saudi Arabia. In 2015, her husband had, in a tweet, criticized former first lady Michelle Obama for not wearing a headscarf during a visit to the kingdom.
For a president who campaigned on an "America First" platform, the trip is a crucial moment for U.S. allies to size up his commitment to decades-long partnerships while trying to move behind his previous controversial statements.
Speech to leaders of Muslim countries Sunday

On Sunday Trump will hold meetings with more than 50 Arab and Muslim leaders heading converging on Riyadh for a regional summit focused largely on combating ISIS and other extremist groups.
The centrepiece of Trump's visit will be his speech at the summit. White House aides view the address as a counter to Obama's 2009 speech to the Muslim world, which Trump criticized as too apologetic for U.S. actions in the region.
Trump will call for unity in the fight against radicalism in the Muslim world, casting the challenge as a "battle between good and evil" and urging Arab leaders to "drive out the terrorists from your places of worship," according to a draft of the speech obtained by The Associated Press. The draft notably refrains from mentioning democracy and human rights — topics Arab leaders often view as U.S. moralizing — in favour of the more limited goals of peace and stability.
It also abandons some of the harsh anti-Muslim rhetoric that defined Trump's presidential campaign and does not contain the words "radical Islamic terror," a phrase Trump repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for not using during last year's campaign.​
Jailed anti-Putin activist says he is being tortured in prison

MOSCOW, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A Russian opposition activist who became the first person to be jailed for repeatedly staging peaceful anti-Kremlin protests under a new law says he is being tortured in prison and fears for his life.
A Moscow court sentenced Ildar Dadin to three years in prison in December for holding a series of one-man protests in a case Amnesty International called "a cynical attack on freedom of expression." His jail term was later reduced to two and a half years on appeal.
Russian rights activists regard Dadin, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin and his policies, as a political prisoner. The authorities say Dadin broke a law, which was introduced after big anti-Kremlin protests, that criminalises anyone who violates protest rules more than twice in 180 days.
In a letter to his wife from prison in north-west Russia published by online news portal Meduza on Tuesday, Dadin, 34, said he was being subject to group beatings where around 10 prison guards would kick him at the same time.
He said he had also had been hung up like a piece of meat with his hands handcuffed behind his back, that he had been stripped and threatened with rape, and that the prison governor had warned him he would be murdered if he complained.
"Regular beatings, bullying, humiliation, insults, intolerable detention conditions - this is happening with the other prisoners, as well," the letter said.
"If I am again subjected to torture, beatings, and rape, it is unlikely that I will last more than a week."
Anastasia Zotova, his wife, said on social media she had felt something was wrong when the prison authorities did not allow her to speak to her husband on the phone or to visit.
When asked about the allegations, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, told reporters that the Russian leader would be informed about Dadin's letter.
"This is a case which merits the closest attention of the relevant authorities, in this case the prison service," said Peskov.
Local investigators and the prison service have said they will investigate Dadin's allegations, Russian news agencies reported.
Dadin told his wife he feared he might be murdered to shut him up.
"In case of my sudden death, you may be told that I committed suicide, had an accident, was shot while trying to escape, or (died) fighting with another prisoner," he wrote.
Caprellidae is a family of amphipods commonly known as skeleton shrimps. Their common name denotes the threadlike slender body which allows them to virtually disappear among the fine filaments of seaweed, hydroids and bryozoans. They are sometimes also known as ghost shrimps.[2] Caprellidae contains 88 genera in three subfamilies.
Description [ edit ]
Caprellids are easily recognizable from other amphipods because of their slender elongated bodies. Their bodies can be divided into three parts - the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon comprises most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The cephalon is usually fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. They possess two pairs of antennae, with the first pair usually longer than the second pair. The cephalon contains mandibles, maxillae, and maxillipeds which function as mouthparts.[3][4]
Each pereonite has a pair of appendages known as pereopods. The first two pairs are modified into raptorial appendages known as gnathopods. These are used for feeding and defense, as well as locomotion. The third and fourth pair of pereopods are usually reduced or absent altogether. In the third and fourth pereonites are two pairs of gills. Sometimes a third pair of gills may also be present on the second pereonite. In mature females, brood pouches formed by extensions of the coxae (oostegites) are present on the third and fourth pereonites. The fifth to seventh pair of pereopods are smaller than the gnathopods and are used for clasping objects the animals anchor themselves upon.[3][4]
Most caprellids are highly sexually dimorphic, with the males usually being far larger than the females.[5]
Ecology [ edit ]
Caprellids are exclusively marine and are found in oceans worldwide. A few species are found in the ocean depths, but most prefer low intertidal zones and subtidal waters among eelgrass, hydroids and bryozoans. They are typically seen attached to substrate by their grasping appendages called the pereopods.
Caprellids are omnivorous, feeding on diatoms, detritus, protozoans, smaller amphipods, and crustacean larvae. Some species are filter feeders, using their antennae to filter food from the water or scrape it off the substrate. Most species are predators that sit and wait like a praying mantis, with their gnathopods ready to snatch any smaller invertebrates which come along. They accentuate their adaptive form and colouration by assuming an angular pose, resembling that of the fronds among which they live.[6] They remain motionless for long periods of time while waiting to ambush their prey, often protozoa or small worms.
Caprellids are typically preyed upon by surf perch, shrimp, nudibranchs such as the lion nudibranch Melibe leonina and brooding anemones (Epiactis prolifera). Since they often inhabit eelgrass beds with sessile jellyfish, (Haliclystus and Thaumatoscyphus), the caprellids frequently become jellyfish food.[7] Caprellids are not normally considered a main source of food for fish, but when shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata) migrate into the eelgrass beds for reproduction, they target caprellids.[8]
Reproduction and growth [ edit ]
Mating can only occur when the female is between the new and hardened exoskeletons, which both male and female do in order to grow. After mating the female will brood the fertilized eggs within her brood pouch. The young will hatch and emerged as juvenile adults.[9] After mating, the female in some species have been known to kill the males by injecting venom from a claw within their gnathopod.[10]
Taxonomy [ edit ]
Caprellidae is classified under the superfamily Caprelloidea which belongs to the infraorder Caprellida of the suborder Corophiidea. Caprellidae contains 1345 genera in three subfamilies.[1]

In recent months, bitcoin has garnered the support from some high-profile Wall Street investors. From pouring money into bitcoin ventures to acquiring stock associated with the digital currency, it seems there are more bulls in bitcoin these days and is becoming a popular investment.
The latest to tip their hat to bitcoin is Michael Novogratz, Fortress Investment Group's Director and Principal, who spoke with Bloomberg News on Monday from the 2014 Sohn Investment Conference in New York to discuss the future of bitcoin why he's buying and how payments systems will dramatically evolve.
Novogratz explained that the reason he is buying the peer-to-peer decentralized virtual currency is because the market cap is between $4.5 and $5 billion and there are approximately 30,000 programmers working on bitcoin.
“So there is an open source community where there is huge brain power, let alone all the seed money that is going in,” said Novogratz. “And so from Marc Andreessen and his company, to Benchmark, to Wences Casares, there's lots of smart money going in. I've never seen a small project with more human capital going into it, and so I kind of want to bet just on that alone.”
Although many say that it's is its greatest curse, Novogratz believes bitcoin has the advantage because it's the very first of its kind. Despite this, the payments systems of the future will be revolutionized and perhaps even a “democratization of finance at one point.”
“I think you'll see peer to peer lending,” Novogratz elaborated. “The banks' biggest threat is the same thing that's happened in so many other industries now. Happening to finance industry. Right. The internet disintermediates large players, and I think Bitcoin is just one of the threats that the finance industry as we know it, has come against it.”
It is reported that Fortress maintains $13 million worth of bitcoins and also became the very first publicly traded firm to file bitcoin holdings.
We also reported in March that Novogratz announced that his firm would be purchasing Pantera Bitcoin Partners, an investment fund with a focus on bitcoin and other virtual currencies.
Bitcoin has become one of the major investments for venture capitalists who are seeking to cash in on the next big thing akin to the Internet in the 1990s. Angel investors have doled out approximately $100 million in companies dealing with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Not everyone is buying bitcoin, though. As has been reported, prominent individuals like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger and Jamie Dimon are steering clear of bitcoin because they believe it's a “mirage” and that all investors should avoid it entirely. Buffett has gone as far predicting that bitcoins will cease to exist within the next 10 to 20 years because it does not have any legitimate store of value.
Housing New Zealand has revealed its plan for building higher density homes across Auckland.
Photo: RNZ / Kim Baker Wilson
It proposes more intensification in both wealthy and poorer areas, than the council.
For the first time it has produced zoning maps that it hopes will be adopted in the city's 30-year blueprint: the Unitary Plan.
From leafy suburbs such as Westmere, to state house heartland in Mount Roskill, Housing New Zealand wants more town houses and apartments.
It has told the independent panel considering the Unitary Plan that Housing New Zealand land could handle more than double the current 31,000 dwellings.
Housing New Zealand currently owns 30,800 homes in Auckland, and said its proposal could add a further 39,000 on the same area of land.
The state-owned corporation is the biggest owner of housing in Auckland, and said its view was in line with a cabinet-endorsed ministerial submission to the Independent Panel considering the proposed plan.

It said the increased capacity was double that offered in the Proposed Unitary Plan, as it was signed-off by Auckland councillors in 2013.
That's the plan now being debated.
More than 30 zoning maps presented by Housing New Zealand, show higher density zonings than proposed by the council in evidence filed in January.
That was prior to the council having to detune some of those plans following a political revolt by councillors, last month.
HNZ's proposals cover not only those suburbs where it is a significant landowner, but also wealthier suburbs where it said the same principles should apply, of intensification along transport routes or close to town and employment centres.
An example of how proposed densities have ramped up over the past three years can be seen in three maps showing the wealthy city-fringe suburb of Westmere.
The 2013 proposed Unitary Plan signed-off by councillors shows most of the suburb in the pale-coloured single house zone.
In the beefed-up 2016 council version - now withdrawn - nearly half of the single house zone had become two-storeyed town houses, called mixed housing suburban.
There is also a big area of three-storeyed dwellings in the darker shaded mixed house urban zone.
The third map is Housing New Zealand's proposal which does away entirely with the single house zone, leaving Westmere with a central core of two-storeyed zoning, surrounded by three storeys.
Housing New Zealand has begun presenting its views at the same time that Auckland Council expert witnesses are being kept away from the crucial residential zoning hearings.
The council made the move after councillors voted 13-8 a fortnight ago, to remove some of the most recent proposed upzonings.
The council accepted legal advice that if its expert witnesses attended they could still have to argue for zonings no longer supported by the politicians.
Housing New Zealand's counsel Dr Claire Kirman told the hearing that the corporation largely supported the now withdrawn council proposals, and that it would summons the expert witnesses for cross-examination.
The panel must compile a final version of the Unitary Plan by 22 July, and pass it to the Auckland Council to accept or to reject in part, raising the possibility of appeals.
Akio Morita (盛田 昭夫, Morita Akio, January 26, 1921 – October 3, 1999) was a Japanese businessman and co-founder of Sony along with Masaru Ibuka.
Early life [ edit ]
Akio Morita was born in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. Morita's family was involved in sake, miso and soy sauce production in the village of Kosugaya (currently a part of Tokoname City) on the western coast of Chita Peninsula in Aichi Prefecture since 1665. He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from Osaka Imperial University with a degree in physics. He was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and served in World War II. During his service, Morita met his future business partner Masaru Ibuka in the Navy's Wartime Research Committee.
Sony [ edit ]
In 1949,Kai ist Fett the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first tape recorder in Japan. In 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully transistorized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (derived from "sonus"—–Latin for "sound"—–and Sonny-boys the most common American expression).[2] Morita was an advocate for all the products made by Sony. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a "pocket sized" appearance. In 1960, it produced the first transistor television in the world. In 1973, Sony received an Emmy Award for its Trinitron television-set technology. In 1975, it released the first Betamax home video recorder, a year before VHS format came out. In 1979, the Walkman was introduced, making it one of the world's first portable music players. In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.
In 1960, the Sony Corporation of America (SONAM, currently abbreviated as SCA) was established in the United States. In 1961, Sony Corporation was the first Japanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, in the form of American depositary receipts (ADRs), which are traded over-the-counter. Sony bought CBS Records Group[3] which consisted of Columbia Records, Epic Records and other CBS labels in 1988 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment (Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures and others) in 1989.
On November 25, 1994, Morita stepped down as Sony chairman after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while playing tennis. He was succeeded by Norio Ohga, who had joined the company in the 1950s after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.
Other affiliations [ edit ]
Morita was vice chairman of the Japan Business Federation (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations), and was a member of the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group, also known as the "Wise Men's Group". He was also the third Japanese chairman of the Trilateral Commission. His amateur radio call sign is JP1DPJ.
Publications [ edit ]
In 1966, Morita wrote a book called Gakureki Muyō Ron (学歴無用論, Never Mind School Records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. In 1986, Morita wrote an autobiography titled Made in Japan. He co-authored the 1991 book The Japan That Can Say No with politician Shintaro Ishihara, where they criticized American business practices and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs. (Actually, Morita had no intention to criticize American practices at that time.) The book was translated into English and caused controversy in the United States, and Morita later had his chapters removed from the English version and distanced himself from the book.[4]
Awards [ edit ]
Morita was awarded the Albert Medal by the United Kingdom's Royal Society of Arts in 1982, the first Japanese to receive the honor. Two years later, he received the prestigious Legion of Honour, and in 1991, was awarded the First Class Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Emperor of Japan. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary British knighthood (KBE). Morita received the International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award from the University of Manitoba in 1987. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1999.
Death [ edit ]
Morita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis. On November 25, 1994, he stepped down as Sony chairman. On October 3, 1999, Morita died of pneumonia at the age of 78.

What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail
What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail
Donald Trump, following weeks of agitation over his advisers' attempts to temper his style, moved Wednesday to overhaul his struggling campaign by rebuffing those efforts and personally elevating two longtime associates who have encouraged his combative populism.
Trump's decision sent a powerful signal to Republicans and Democrats alike that the real estate magnate intends to finish the presidential race on his own terms and that his closing argument to voters will defy the usual partisan template of general-election campaigns.
In its place will be a political pitch with ire directed at both parties and a fierce anti-establishment ethos, coupled with harsh critiques of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
Trump plans to devote himself primarily to five crucial states — Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania — where he hopes that raucous rallies and a relentless presence on television will electrify his working-class base and thousands of other people who have grown disengaged and frustrated with the political class.
Guiding Trump as he turns to the fall will be a new campaign chief executive, Stephen Bannon, a former banker who runs the influential conservative outlet Breitbart News and is known for his right-wing, nationalist politics. Kellyanne Conway, a veteran Republican pollster who has been close to Trump for years, will assume the role of campaign manager.

Trump's reset effectively ended a monthslong push by campaign chairman Paul Manafort to moderate Trump's presentation and pitch for the broader electorate. And it comes just 12 weeks before Election Day, and after weeks of self-inflicted wounds that have caused some members of the GOP establishment to panic that Trump may severely damage the chances of down-ballot Republican candidates across the country.
[The Take: Trump staff shake-up highlights a candidate who has lost his way]
Despondent or unsure of Trump's willingness — or ability — to broaden his national appeal, several Republican consultants have urged the Republican National Committee to consider redirecting funds in the fall if his campaign appears irredeemable.
Manafort, a seasoned operative who joined the campaign in March, will keep his job title, but advisers described his status as diminished as a result of Trump's unhappiness and restlessness in recent weeks over his drop in the polls and reports over lagging organization in several key states. The candidate has privately told friends that he was unsure whether he was being given candid assessments of news stories and of the campaign's management.
Although Trump respects Manafort, aides said, he grew to feel “boxed in” and “controlled” by people who barely know him. Moving forward, he plans to focus on rousing his voters at boisterous rallies and through media appearances.
Sean Spicer, chief strategist at the Republican National Committee, said Wednesday that the national party is already working with the new high command and remains fully committed to supporting Trump's candidacy in the coming months.
“The campaign is expanding and bringing in more senior people in the final stretch. Obviously that's a healthy thing,” Spicer said, saying he spoke with Bannon by phone late Tuesday and remains in close touch with the new Trump chief executive by email.

But Rick Wilson, a GOP consultant working for independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, said angst was evident Wednesday morning in a round of phone calls to staffers on Capitol Hill. He predicted that the RNC would be pressured to eventually distance itself from Bannon, and possibly from Trump, to protect Republican candidates in vulnerable districts and states.
“If you were looking for a tone or pivot, Bannon will pivot you in a dark, racist and divisive direction. It'll be a nationalist, hateful campaign,” Wilson said. “Republicans should run away.”
[It seemed like Trump and Breitbart couldn't be closer. Then its chairman joined the campaign.]
During a campaign event in Cleveland, Clinton scoffed at the idea that the personnel changes would improve Trump's campaign. She quoted poet Maya Angelou to sum up her view of the Trump campaign realignment: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them,” Clinton said. “I think it's fair to say that Donald Trump has shown us who he is.”
Trump's moves are in part a reversion to how he ran his campaign in the primaries with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, whose mantra was “let Trump be Trump.” The candidate wants to get back to that type of campaign culture, aides said.
The reshuffling also comes amid growing controversy over Manafort's past as an adviser to foreign dictators and oligarchs. In Ukraine, corruption investigators suggest he may have received $12 million in undisclosed cash payments earmarked in a ledger kept by the political party of former president Viktor Yanukovych, a Manafort client. Manafort has denied receiving the payments.
In Bannon, Trump is turning to an alter ego of sorts — a colorful, edgy figure on the right who has worked at Goldman Sachs and made several films, including a documentary about former Alaska governor Sarah Palin.
Bannon, in phone calls and meetings, has been imploring Trump for months to avoid running a fall campaign that makes Republican donors and officials comfortable, aides said. Instead, Bannon has been telling Trump to run more fully as an outsider and an unabashed nationalist.
“I want to win,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the campaign shake-up. “That's why I'm bringing on fantastic people who know how to win and love to win.”
Trump's decision developed over the weekend as he traveled to the Hamptons on Long Island for a Saturday evening fundraiser at the home of Woody Johnson, the wealthy Republican benefactor who owns the National Football League's New York Jets.
According to three Republicans familiar with that event, Trump was confronted by several supporters, including mega-donor Rebekah Mercer, about news reports on his advisers' desire to tame his personality. The three Republicans spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the campaign's transition and their relationships with Trump, Bannon and Conway.
[Meet Kellyanne Conway, Trump's new campaign manager]
Trump was visibly infuriated at the news stories, the Republicans said, and he conferred with Mercer about potential steps he might take to remake his campaign and populate his inner circle with voices more like his own.
Bannon's and Conway's names soon came up. Mercer, the daughter of hedge-fund titan Robert Mercer, spoke highly of both. (The Mercer family is a prominent investor in Breitbart News as well as in a super PAC opposing Clinton and has worked with Conway.) Trump did the same.
By Sunday, as Manafort appeared on network television shows, Trump was stewing and dialing up his friends, the Republicans said. He connected with his son-in-law and trusted adviser Jared Kushner, who had been on vacation in Europe. Then he called Conway and Bannon, ruminating aloud on how they could help him jolt his stalled candidacy.
The Journal reported that Bannon met with Trump later Sunday at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., to “lay out his new thinking for the campaign team.”
Bannon and Conway, who are friendly, both told Trump they'd be willing to work together and that they understood Trump's vision for the rest of the campaign, the Republicans said. While careful to not be critical of Manafort — Conway on Wednesday referred to the changes as an “expansion” rather than a shake-up — they told Trump they would be dedicated to sharpening his message rather than handling him.
Conway worked on Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign and has long counted Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, as a client. During the primaries, she backed Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and managed a pro-Cruz super PAC.
Bannon quickly began to prepare for a takeover. He was spotted at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Monday and worked there Tuesday.
[Before she worked for him, Trump's new campaign manager identified his campaign's problems]
The campaign's revised structure started to take shape Tuesday afternoon at Trump Tower. Kushner, back from the vacation in Croatia with his wife, Ivanka Trump, joined Manafort, Manafort's deputy Rick Gates, Conway and Bannon, the aides said.
Trump's decision to transfer oversight of the campaign was deliberated at length. At the same time, Bannon and Conway were also remotely assisting Trump as he prepared a speech delivered later Tuesday evening in Wisconsin.
Moving forward, Trump is hopeful that Manafort will remain involved and a leader within the campaign with a possible emphasis on building Trump's Washington operation, one of the Republicans said.
But Bannon's position could make any attempt to smooth relations in Washington difficult. Breitbart News has been harshly critical of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and is seen as an antagonistic organ by congressional GOP leaders.
In the short term, Trump campaign advisers will seek to keep the candidate fixated on two themes that have animated him in recent months: defeating terrorism and bolstering law enforcement, which they see as an effective way to run against Clinton.
Gingrich, a Trump ally, said in an interview that “Manafort has done a remarkable job, but they're expanding from something that was like a medium-sized Senate race to a national campaign.”
[The Fix: Trump is going back to being Trump. That is a big problem for Republicans.]
Trump has labored to stay on message since the Republican National Convention last month, erasing the steady footing he had developed in polls against Clinton through a series of self-inflicted wounds that have driven news cycle after news cycle. He has seemed intent on settling scores from the GOP primaries, suggested that Russia should find and release Clinton's personal emails, and initially withheld endorsements of Ryan and other high-profile Republicans.
But the episode that drew the heaviest criticism from members of both parties was his protracted feud with two Muslim American Gold Star parents whose son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, was killed while he served in Iraq. After the father, Khizr Khan, delivered an impassioned denunciation of Trump at the Democratic convention, Trump suggested that Khan's wife, Ghazala, remained silent on stage because of the couple's religion. She denounced his remarks in the following days, telling the public that her grief made it too difficult to speak about her son.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll released this month showed Clinton opening an eight-point lead against Trump among registered voters. Nearly 6 in 10 voters surveyed in that poll said they do not believe he is qualified to be president. Trump's persistent unpopularity with minority voters has outweighed his strength among white voters in key battleground states and has put several noncompetitive states for Democrats into play.
“You know, I am who I am,” Trump told a Wisconsin television station Tuesday. “It's me. I don't want to change. Everyone talks about, ‘Oh, well, you're going to pivot, you're going to.' I don't want to pivot. I mean, you have to be you.”
DelReal reported from Washington. Anne Gearan and Abby Phillip in Washington contributed to this report.
A new generation of pioneers have struck proverbial gold at an abandoned silver mine near Aspen.
What was once a wasteland of arsenic, cadmium, lead and zinc on a steep mountainside that abuts Castle Creek is now a haven for natural grasses and wildflowers that have stabilized the slope and drastically reduced the risk of the heavy metals crashing into the city's main water supply.
The striking change of scenery around Hope Mine is the result of the first whole-scale reclamation project ever attempted in the United States, and possibly the world, using biochar — a type of charcoal produced through the thermal treatment of organic material in an oxygen-limited environment.
“We really were surprised how aggressive the regrowth was,” said John Bennett, executive director of For The Forest, which teamed up with Carbondale-based Flux Farm Foundation at the request of the U.S. Forest Service, which is exploring new ways to partner with private groups to reclaim landscapes. “We did not expect waist-high grass in the very first summer. We thought it would take longer.”
Not only is biochar restoring the ecology and containing the mine tailings that fan down toward Castle Creek but experts say it is also immobilizing the heavy metals long enough so that they naturally degrade and it is sequestering carbon that would otherwise escape into the earth's atmosphere.
The success at the aptly named mine is providing hope for federal officials looking to clean up an estimated 23,000 abandoned mines in Colorado and exponentially many more that scar the American West.
“Too many communities still live with the ghosts of their mining pasts — the abandoned mines that continue to threaten public safety and livelihoods that depend on clean watersheds — which is why I'm trying to make it easier for volunteers and Good Samaritans to help clean up these sites,” Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., told the Colorado Independent this week. “We need exactly this kind of public-private collaboration to fix a problem neither side has been able to tackle alone, and to make a real difference in our communities. Clean streams mean the fish can return, people can drink the water, and tourists will bring dollars and jobs back into these communities, making it a win-win effort.”
For years, Udall has been working to introduce so-called Good Samaritan legislation to provide legal protection for nonprofit and others groups who clean up water contamination from old hardrock mines. So far, the mining industry and even environmental groups concerned that extraction companies could abuse the law have stymied the senator's efforts. More recently, Udall and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., have encouraged the Environmental Protection Agency to use its administrative discretion.
“The EPA has existing guidance that encourages potential Good Samaritans to enter into voluntary agreements with EPA or federal land management agencies that helps to facilitate Good Samaritan cleanups,” the senators recently wrote in a letter to the EPA. “We believe that the guidance could be updated to provide additional clarity to Good Samaritans that compliance with such agreements is sufficient to satisfy requirements that help protect environmental quality, including water quality.”
In the case of the Hope Mine project, For The Forest is working under a memorandum of understanding with federal authorities that Bennett believes provides “a reasonable level of protection.”
But to get more work done, he said, Good Samaritan legislation is “really wise and certainly needed.”
“The problems in forest restoration are so large that no one entity can do it alone. The Forest Service is very quick to admit they don't have the resources and no one community certainly does,” Bennett said.
“It's going to take a lot of people working together. It's hard to expect someone to step forward and volunteer to help restore the ecology of these landscapes when the prospect of litigation hangs over their head in the event something goes wrong in some future year despite their best intentions.”
Falling like letters peeled off a page
We go into that treacherous cove
Where all abandon ends in light
And my pen trembles like a bow
You wouldn't let me go alone
So here we are together
Every time I'd throw a stone
You'd feed it right back to me
Roll back the granite doorway
Reveal the cave
So much beauty hoarded here
So many good thoughts, of you
Shameful journeymen they'd say
That most wicked of escapes
Allows in me a fleeting breath
Of creative clarity, of substance
But still I took you here
And it is bad
Bad
Bad
Why fall in love with someone
Whose world is visibly dead
And strewn with the refuse
Of every Western principle?
Why follow me into dark corners
For just one glimpse of light
That burns hot for an instant
Until it disappears?
But you did
You are my guilt now
And my painful love
To have come down here with me
To see what I might find
There is nothing sacred so
Why this?
There is nothing lasting so
Why this?
There is nothing but love and
Short bliss
There is a world uncannily gone
Where my heart cannot allow
Fuck all of your religions
Fuck all of your taboos
Fuck your houses and your cars
Fuck the prison around your head
Set me free, let me fail and see
I know I will return because I believe
And if I die I'll scatter my heart
All across our bed
So what joys are in the dark
Can come to light again
Ones like you and me
Journeymen who still live free
When we crawl out of the cove
Run our fingers through the red sand
And claim the rocky shore
Made to witness all around
Their dreary catastrophe
Their heartless epilogue
Their money-driven schemes
That made a world
Said no to authenticity
And died reluctantly

After the Hurricane
Avoid debris, downed power lines, and flood water, which may be electrically charged and hide dangerous debris or places where the ground is washed away. Avoid downed power or utility lines as they may be live with deadly voltage. Stay away and report them immediately to your power or utility company.
Emergency workers may be assisting people in flooded areas or cleaning up debris. You can help them by staying off the roads and out of the way as much as possible.
If your home has flood water inside or around it, don't walk or wade in it.The water may be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage.
If you have a flooded basement in your home, never attempt to turn off power or operate circuit breakers while standing in water.
If your power is out, safely use a generator or battery-operated flashlights.
Never use a generator inside a home, basement, shed or garage even if doors and windows are open.
Keep generators outside and far away from windows, doors and vents. Read both the label on your generator and the owner's manual and follow the instructions.
Avoid plugging emergency generators into electric outlets or hooking them directly to your home's electrical system – they can feed electricity back into the power lines, putting you and line workers in danger.
Tips for Clean-Up
Below are a few simple guidelines to follow that will make the clean-up and salvage process safer and easier:
Fact Sheets
Returning Home
Always wear protective clothing including long-sleeved shirts, long pants, rubber or plastic gloves and waterproof boots or shoes.
Before entering your home, look outside for damaged power lines, gas lines and other exterior damage.
Take photos of your damage before you begin clean up and save repair receipts.
Your home may be contaminated with mold, which raises the health risk for those with asthma, allergies and breathing conditions. Refer to the Center for Disease Control for more info on mold: www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/pdf/flyer-get-rid-of-mold.pdf.
Open doors and windows so your house can air out before spending any length of time inside.
Turn off main electrical power and water systems and don't use gas appliances until a professional can ensure they are safe.
Check all ceilings and floors for signs of sagging or other potentially dangerous structural damage.
Throw out all foods, beverages and medicines exposed to flood waters or mud including canned goods and containers with food or liquid.
Also, throw out any items that absorb water and cannot be cleaned or disinfected (mattresses, carpeting, stuffed animals, etc.).
Beware of snakes, insects, and other animals that may be on your property or in your home.
Remove all drywall and insulation that has been in contact with flood waters.
Clean all hard surfaces (flooring, countertops, appliances, sinks, etc.) thoroughly with hot water and soap or detergent.
Returning Home
Road conditions, traffic, severe weather, and gas are all factors to consider after Hurricane Irma. If you evacuated for the storm, check with local officials both where you're staying and back home before you travel.
Here are a few more travel tips:
Let friends & family know before you leave and when you arrive
Charge devices and consider getting back-up batteries in case power-outages continue
Fill up your gas tank and consider downloading a fuel app to check for outages along your route
Bring supplies such as water and non-perishable food for the car ride
Survivors should expect and prepare for significant, ongoing impacts, and disruptions to daily activities, and remember that returning home before storm debris is cleared is dangerous.

Helping Children Cope
Children may cope more effectively with a disaster when they feel they understand what is happening and what they can do to help protect themselves, their family, and friends. Here's how you can help them cope and a Fact Sheet:
Talk about the concerns about the storm with your children. To not talk about it makes it even more threatening in your children's mind. Start by asking what your children have already heard and what understanding they have. As your children explain, listen for misinformation, misconceptions, and underlying fears or concerns, and then address these.
Explain - as simply and directly as possible - what is happening or likely to happen. The amount of information that will be helpful to children depends on their age and developmental level, as well as their coping style. For example, older children generally want and will benefit from more detailed information than younger children. Because every child is different, take cues from your own children as to how much information to provide.
Encourage your children to ask questions, and answer those questions directly. Like adults, children are better able to cope with a crisis if they feel they understand it. Question-and-answer exchanges help to ensure ongoing support as your children begin to understand the crisis and the response to it.
Limit television viewing of disasters and other crisis events, especially for younger children. Consider coverage on all media, including the internet and social media. When older children watch television, try to watch with them and use the opportunity to discuss what is being seen and how it makes you and your children feel.
Reassure children of the steps that are being taken to keep them safe. Disasters and other crises remind us that we are never completely safe from harm. Now more than ever it is important to reassure children that, in reality, they should feel safe in their schools, homes, and communities.
Consider sharing your feelings about a crisis with your children. This is an opportunity for you to role model how to cope and how to plan for the future. Before you reach out, however, be sure that you are able to express a positive or hopeful plan.
Help your children to identify concrete actions they can take to help those affected by recent events. Rather than focus on what could have been done to prevent a disaster or other crisis, concentrate on what can be done now to help those affected by the event.
Play games and do activities together to create meaningful dialogue and offer a distraction.
If you have concerns about your children's behavior, contact your children's pediatrician, other primary care provider, or a qualified mental health professional.
Beware of Fraud & Price Gouging
After a disaster scam artists, identity thieves and other criminals may attempt to prey on vulnerable survivors. The most common post-disaster fraud practices include phony housing inspectors, fraudulent building contractors, bogus pleas for disaster donations and fake offers of state or federal aid. Survivors should keep in mind: FEMA does not authorize individual contractors to solicit on its behalf. Beware of any individual contractors contacting you directly on behalf of FEMA to sign you up for debris removal or remediation services.
If you have any concerns about individuals representing themselves as FEMA or would like to report fraud, please contact the National Center for Disaster Fraud at (866) 720-5721 or via email at disaster@leo.gov .
. Federal and state workers never ask for, or accept money, and always carry identification badges
There is NO FEE required to apply for or to get disaster assistance from FEMA, the U.S. Small Business Administration or the state
required to apply for or to get disaster assistance from FEMA, the U.S. Small Business Administration or the state Scam attempts can be made over the phone, by mail or email, text or in person Price Gouging occurs when a supplier marks up the price of an item more than is justified by his actual costs. Survivors are particularly susceptible because their needs are immediate, and have few alternatives to choose from. If you find price gouging, contact you the Florida State Office of the Attorney General. Report Price Gouging Call: 1-866-966-7226
Price Gouging Complaint form Dealing with Contractors: Survivors should take steps to protect themselves and avoid fraud when hiring contractors to clean property, remove debris or make repairs. Simple rules to avoid becoming a victim of fraud: Only use contractors licensed by your state
Get a written estimate and get more than one estimate
Demand and check references
Ask for proof of insurance i.e., liability and Workmen's Compensation
Insist on a written contract and refuse to sign a contract with blank spaces
Get any guarantees in writing
Make final payments only after the work is completed
Pay by check. The best way to avoid fraud is to arm yourself against it by having a checklist to remind you of what you need to demand when hiring a contractor.
How to Help
This One Simple Thing Can Make Your Life Much Better
Go Buy A Notebook
Many people have written to me saying they love all the research on bettering themselves but need that first step on how to shoehorn it in to their day-to-day life.
Incorporating a lot of the blog's strategies can be as easy as buying a notebook.
(No, it doesn't need to have glitter on it or say “MY SECRET DIARY” on the front.)
Others might think: “I don't need to write stuff down. Reading is enough.”
Nope.
A lot of research shows your brain sees writing differently than thinking or talking.
Writing forces you to organize and clarify your thoughts. You learn better when you write things down and are more likely to follow through.
So what should you be writing in this notebook?
1) Write down what you're looking forward to.
People who devote time to anticipating fun experiences are happier.
So at least once a week, make plans, write them down and when you need a boost, look at the great things you have coming up.
From Shawn Achor's The Happiness Advantage:
One study found that people who just thought about watching their favorite movie actually raised their endorphin levels by 27 percent. Often, the most enjoyable part of an activity is the anticipation. If you can't take the time for a vacation right now, or even a night out with friends, put something on the calendar—even if it's a month or a year down the road. Then whenever you need a boost of happiness, remind yourself about it.
(For more activities that will make you happier, click here.)
2) Write down your progress.
Want to know your strengths and weaknesses? Make predictions, write them down and compare against results.
This is an excellent way to see where your natural abilities are and if you're improving.
From management guru Pete Drucker:
The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations… Look for patterns in what you're seeing: What results are you skilled at generating? What abilities do you need to enhance in order to get the results you want? What unproductive habits are preventing you from creating the outcomes you desire? In identifying opportunities for improvement, don't waste time cultivating skill areas where you have little competence. Instead, concentrate on—and build on—your strengths.
Making notes about your preferences and experiences can help you turn your notebook into a personal handbook.
You'll know yourself better and be able to make better decisions if you record your feelings and expectations when things happen.

3) Write down your goals
You're more likely to follow through on things that you write down. Writing down obstacles and how you'll address them increases levels of hope — and success.
Writing about your goals can make you happier and even healthier:
Writing about life goals was significantly less upsetting than writing about trauma and was associated with a significant increase in subjective well-being. Five months after writing, a significant interaction emerged such that writing about trauma, one's best possible self, or both were associated with decreased illness compared with controls.
Everybody knows they should write down goals and everyone has goals but no one does it. Why?
They take it too seriously and they're afraid. Don't sweat it. Just jot them down. Goals can change but in the meantime they will help guide decisions when you're stuck.

4) Write down your ideas.
Many of the great geniuses all kept notebooks. Why? Their ideas rarely, if ever, exploded out as one big EUREKA!
They developed over time and that evolution needed to be recorded and shaped.
Via Zig Zag: The Surprising Path to Greater Creativity:
Creativity started with the notebooks' sketches and jottings, and only later resulted in a pure, powerful idea. The one characteristic that all of these creatives shared— whether they were painters, actors, or scientists— was how often they put their early thoughts and inklings out into the world, in sketches, dashed-off phrases and observations, bits of dialogue, and quick prototypes. Instead of arriving in one giant leap, great creations emerged by zigs and zags as their creators engaged over and over again with these externalized images.
Got an idea? Good one? Mediocre one? Doesn't matter. Write it down. Many times those mediocre ones become good ones with work.
(For more on how to be successful and happy, click here.)
5) Write down your anxieties
Research shows writing about your worries can calm you and even increase performance:
…for students given the opportunity to write before the exam, those highest in test anxiety performed just as well as their less anxious classmates. “Writing about your worries for 10 minutes before an upcoming exam leveled the playing field such that those students who usually get most anxious during exams were able to overcome their fears and perform up to their potential,” Beilock said.
Projects at work bothering you long after you leave the office? Write down a plan for how to deal with them before you leave.
Research shows talking to someone after a traumatic event doesn't help. But writing about it does.
Designating a time to worry can actually be a great strategy, funny as it sounds. And write those worries down to put them to rest.
(For more on how to stop worrying, click here.)
6) Write about your relationship
Writing about relationships improves relationships:
Writing about emotional experiences is associated with a host of positive outcomes. This study extended the expressive-writing paradigm to the realm of romantic relationships to examine the social effects of writing. For 3 consecutive days, one person from each of 86 dating couples either wrote about his or her deepest thoughts and feelings about the relationship or wrote about his or her daily activities. In the days before and after writing, instant messages were collected from the couples. Participants who wrote about their relationship were significantly more likely to still be dating their romantic partners 3 months later.

7) Write down the good things that happen to you.
Long time readers have heard me beat the drum on this one a million times. (Which makes me wonder: Have you guys ever actually tried it?)
Professor Martin Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania, who developed the technique, refers to it as 3 blessings. It's been shown again and again to help people improve their outlook.
Seligman explains it in his book Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being:
Every night for the next week, set aside ten minutes before you go to sleep. Write down three things that went well today and why they went well. You may use a journal or your computer to write about the events, but it is important that you have a physical record of what you wrote. The three things need not be earthshaking in importance (“ My husband picked up my favorite ice cream for dessert on the way home from work today”), but they can be important (“ My sister just gave birth to a healthy baby boy”). Next to each positive event, answer the question “Why did this happen?”
Give it a shot. Only takes a minute every night.
(For more secrets of the happiest people, click here.)
8) Write down your story.
Reinterpreting your life events into a story, from a new perspective, can not only change how you see your life, but change how you behave going forward.
Timothy Wilson, author of Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change, talks about how the process of “story-editing” can help us improve our lives:
I call the first “story prompting,” whereby people are given information that prompts them to change the way they view themselves and the causes of their behavior. An example is a study I did with college students many years ago (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1982). The participants were first-year students who weren't doing well academically. As part of what they thought was a survey, they read information suggesting that many college students do poorly at first but improve over time. We also showed the students videotaped interviews of juniors and seniors who reinforced this message. In other words, we prompted students to reinterpret their academic problems from a belief that they couldn't cut it in college to the view that they simply needed to learn the ropes. The students who got this prompt—compared to a control group that didn't—got better grades the next year and were less likely to drop out.

Thracian culture is one of the mysterious parts of Slavic Balkan state Bulgaria. Thracian's culture was famous for it's amazing amount of golden relics, artifacts and artistically rich remains they left. This time the famous and very valuable Thracian gold was exhibited in a Moscow Museum where visitors could learn about Thracian culture, it's impact on Bulgarian Slavic culture and naturally were all history enthusiasts could enjoy researching how once famous culture looked like! via(source)
[divider]
Bulgaria as a country has a Slavic culture that has long had strong ties to Russia, both linguistic to cultural from their shared Slavic roots and their Orthodox Christian heritage.
This was a cultural exchange, made in cooperation between Russian and Bulgarian ministries of culture and as such it has resulted in the arrival of the Ancient Thrace exhibit in the State Historical Museum. More so as the culture of Ancient Thrace is completely alien to modern Bulgaria and Russia.
Ambassador Boiko Kotsev of Bulgaria has described these artifacts as “a unique exhibit, a pearl of European and world art.”
Many scholars generally use phrase “Ancient Thrace” to describe the dominant culture of Balkans between about 500 B.C. and A.D. 100, more precisely in the territory corresponding to present-day Bulgaria and Romania.

JINDO, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's prime minister resigned Sunday over the government's handling of a ferry sinking that has left more than 300 people dead or missing and led to widespread shame, fury and finger-pointing, blaming "deep-rooted evils" in society for the tragedy.
South Korean executive power is largely concentrated in the president, so Chung Hong-won's resignation appears to be symbolic. Presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said President Park Geun-hye would accept the resignation, but did not say when Chung would leave office.
Chung's resignation comes amid rising indignation over claims by the victims' relatives that the government did not do enough to rescue or protect their loved ones. Most of the dead and missing were high school students on a school trip.
Officials have taken into custody all 15 people involved in navigating the ferry Sewol, which sank April 16. A prosecutor revealed that investigators were also looking into communications made as the ship sank between a crew member and the company that owns the ferry.
Chung was heckled by victims' relatives and his car was blocked when he visited a shelter on an island near the site of the sinking a week ago. On Sunday, he gave his reasoning for the resignation to reporters in Seoul.
"As I saw grieving families suffering with the pain of losing their loved ones and the sadness and resentment of the public, I thought I should take all responsibility as prime minister," Chung said. "There have been so many varieties of irregularities that have continued in every corner of our society and practices that have gone wrong. I hope these deep-rooted evils get corrected this time and this kind of accident never happens again."
Meanwhile, senior prosecutor Yang Jung-jin said that two helmsmen and two members of the steering crew who were detained Saturday had been formally arrested. Eleven other crew members, including the captain, had been arrested earlier.
Yang also said that a crew member called the ship's owner, Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd., as the ferry was listing, but declined to disclose whether the caller was the captain. Local media reported that the captain called for company approval of an evacuation. Prosecutors said they are analyzing the content of communications between the ship and the company.
The arrested crew members are accused of negligence and of failing to help passengers in need. Capt. Lee Joon-seok initially told passengers to stay in their rooms and took half an hour to issue an evacuation order, by which time the ship was tilting too severely for many people to get out.
Divers have recovered 188 bodies and 114 people are believed to be missing, though the government-wide emergency task force has said the ship's passengers list could be inaccurate. Only 174 people survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members.
The seven surviving crew members who have not been arrested or detained held non-marine jobs such as chef or steward, according to Yang.
Lee told reporters after his arrest that he withheld the evacuation order because rescuers had yet to arrive and he feared for passengers' safety in the cold, swift water. Crew members have also defended their actions.
Helmsman Oh Yong-seok, one of those arrested Saturday, has said he and several crew members did their best to save people. He said that he and four crew members worked from nearby boats to smash windows on the sinking ferry, dragging six passengers stuck in cabins to safety.
The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said it would soon change ferry systems so that passenger, vehicle and cargo information is processed electronically. There is not only uncertainty about how many people were on the Sewol, but a huge discrepancy regarding the amount of cargo it was carrying when it sank.
The ferry was carrying an estimated 3,608 tons of cargo, according to an executive of the company that loaded it. That far exceeds what the captain claimed in paperwork -- 150 cars and 657 tons of other cargo, according to the coast guard -- and is more than three times what an inspector who examined the vessel during a redesign last year said it could safely carry.
Yang, the prosecutor, said that the cause of the sinking could be due to excessive veering, improper stowage of cargo, modifications made to the ship and tidal influence. He said investigators would determine the cause by consulting with experts and using simulations.
Prosecutors have also seized documents from Jindo Vessel Traffic Services Center and Jeju Vessel Traffic Services Center, Yang said, and are analyzing communication messages, vessel tracking data and security camera recordings and others. The centers communicated with Sewol crew members as the ship listed and filled with water. The communications revealed confusion and indecision on the evacuation.
Despite bad weather, dozens of divers continued underwater searches for the missing on Sunday, said Ko Myung-seok, a spokesman for the emergency task force. One body was found, bringing the confirmed death toll to 188.
Officials said Saturday that divers had reached two large sleeping units in the ferry where many of the lost may lie dead. Large objects that toppled when the vessel tipped over and sank are believed to be keeping divers from reaching bodies in at least one of the two rooms.
Fifty students from Danwon High School in Ansan, a city near Seoul, were booked into one of the rooms. Danwon students make up more than 80 percent of the dead and missing; they had been on their way to the southern tourist island of Jeju.
"I just want to find my son's corpse. I want to see him one last time and hold a funeral for him," said Lim Hee-bin, as he exhaled cigarette smoke near his tent at Paengmok port in Jindo. "But the government search operation is too slow. It's total nonsense."
Lim said his son, Lim Hyun-jin, called him as the ship sank but the call was cut off. His son also sent him blurry and shaky photos showing his friends wearing orange life jackets and seated in a cabin.
"There are the last photos he sent me," Lim said. "These show they were in a dangerous situation."
