Aggrey Siryoyi Awori (23 February 1939 – 5 July 2021) was a Ugandan economist, politician and Olympic hurdler, who served as Minister for Information and Communications Technology in the Cabinet of Uganda from 16 February 2009 to 27 May 2011. Prior to that, he represented Samia-Bugwe North, Busia District in the Ugandan Parliament from 2001 until 2006. Awori was an outspoken opposition member of parliament for the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) political party. In 2007, he abandoned the UPC and joined the ruling National Resistance Movement.
Background
Awori was born on 23 February 1939, in Budimo Village, Busia District, near the Ugandan/Kenyan border as the tenth of seventeen children. His parents were Canon Jeremiah Musungu Awori, a pioneer African priest of the Anglican Church in East Africa and Mrs. Mariamu Odongo Awori, a nurse and community teacher. Aggrey's siblings include the ninth Kenyan vice-president Arthur Moody Awori and Mary Okelo, the first woman in East Africa to head a Barclays Bank branch and the founder of the Kenya Women Finance Trust, Kenya's women only bank. Mary is also the founder of Makini Schools, a leading school chain in East Africa.
Awori owned an urban home in Busia Municipality and a country home in neighboring Bugiri District.
Education
Awori attended Nabumali High School in Mbale District and King's College Budo, in Wakiso District, both in Uganda. He was the Canada House Prefect at King's College Budo. While at King's College Budo (1959 to 1961), Aggrey was selected among a few others for elite military officers training at Sandhurst Military College in the United Kingdom. His father Canon Awori, however, rejected the idea of his talented son joining the military. From 1961 to 1965, he studied at Harvard University on a scholarship. The first year he took nuclear physics, but then switched over to political economics.
While at Harvard, Aggrey became the first person in heptagonal track history to win three events - the long jump, high hurdles, and 60-yard dash, tying the heptagonal record in the hurdles and setting the mark in the dash. He also ran on the victorious mile relay team that tied the heptagonal record. By the time he graduated from Harvard, Awori held three outdoor and five indoor school records. He also represented Uganda in the 110 metres hurdles at the 1960 Summer Olympics and the 1964 Summer Olympics, but failed to win any medals.
Awori has a Master of Arts in economics from Syracuse University in the U.S.
Career
In 1967, Awori was appointed the first local director of Uganda Television (UTV). In 1971 Awori was jailed for two months after Idi Amin's coup, because during Amin's first coup attempt he didn't broadcast a speech Amin gave, lying to him by saying that they were live on air. He went into political exile in Kenya, where he taught political journalism at the University of Nairobi until 1976 and then traveled around Africa visiting Tanzania, Liberia and Senegal and returning to Nairobi in 1979.
After Idi Amin was overthrown in 1979, Awori returned to Uganda. He ran for a seat in the National Assembly of Uganda, but lost. He then became Ambassador to the United States, until being transferred by Tito Okello Lutwa in 1985. He served as Uganda's Ambassador to Belgium from 1985 until 1987, when he was dropped by Yoweri Museveni.
After a brief asylum in Nairobi, Awori started to build up a rebel group operating from eastern Uganda named Force Obote Back Again (FOBA). He stated that his reason for doing so was mainly anger at Museveni's National Resistance Army, which had confiscated his property. In 1992, he dissolved his rebel group, which had consisted mainly of young fighters. In 1993, Awori met with Museveni in New York and then was elected to the Constituent Assembly to drawing up the country's new constitution and as a member of parliament.
He came third in the 2001 presidential elections, polling 1.41% of the vote.
He represented Samia-Bugwe North, Busia District in the Ugandan Parliament from 2001 until 2006. Awori was an outspoken opposition member of parliament for the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) political party. In 2007, he abandoned the UPC and joined the ruling National Resistance Movement political party.
He was the Minister for Information & Communications Technology in the Cabinet of Uganda from 16 February 2009 to 27 May 2011. In the cabinet reshuffle of 27 May 2011, he was dropped from the cabinet and replaced by Ruhakana Rugunda. On account of his cabinet post, he was an ex officio Member of the Ugandan Parliament (MP).
Personal details
He was married to Thelma Awori, who worked as Director for Africa at the United Nations Development Programme. Together they were the parents of six adult children.
Aggrey Awori, at the age of 82, died from COVID-19 on 5 July 2021, at a private hospital in Naalya, Kampala.

The Mocha coffee bean is a variety of coffee bean originally from Yemen. It is harvested from the coffee-plant species Coffea arabica, which is native to Yemen. In appearance it is very small, hard, round with an irregular shape, and olive green to pale yellow in color.
The name "Mocha" comes from the port of Mocha (al-Mukhā) through which most Yemeni coffee was exported before the 20th century. , it was mostly exported via Aden and Hodeida. The central market for Yemeni coffee is at Bayt al-Faqih, about 140 km north of Mocha, and the coffee is grown in the mountain districts of Jabal Haraz, al-Udayn (sometimes written Uden), and Ta'izz, to the east.

Grave Circle A is a 16th-century BC royal cemetery situated to the south of the Lion Gate, the main entrance of the Bronze Age citadel of Mycenae in southern Greece. This burial complex was initially constructed outside the walls of Mycenae and ultimately enclosed in the acropolis when the fortification was extended during the 13th century BC. Grave Circle A and Grave Circle B, the latter found outside the walls of Mycenae, represents one of the significant characteristics of the early phase of the Mycenaean civilization.
The site circle has a diameter of 27.5 m (90ft) and contains six shaft graves. The largest of the shaft graves measures about 6.5 m (21 ft 3 in) in length and about 4.1 m (13 ft 6 in) in width. A total of nineteen bodies of men, women, and children buried here, with two to five bodies per shaft. It has been suggested that a mound was constructed over each grave, and funeral stelae were erected. Among the funerary gifts found were a series of gold death masks, full sets of weapons, ornate staffs, gold jewelry, as well as gold and silver cups. The funerary gifts found here are more precious than that of those at Grave Circle B. It has been estimated that Circle A contained about 15 kilos of gold in total (not all high purity); a considerable quantity, but a good deal less than in just the inner coffin of Tutankhamun.
The site was excavated by the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in 1876, following the descriptions of Homer and Pausanias. One of the five gold death masks he unearthed became known as "The Death Mask of Agamemnon", ruler of Mycenae, of Greek mythology. However, it has been proven that the burials are dated approximately three centuries earlier before Agamemnon is supposed to have lived.
The valuable funerary gifts in the graves suggest that powerful rulers were buried in this site. Although Agamemnon was supposed to have lived centuries later, these graves might have belonged to the former ruling dynasty of Mycenae – in Greek mythology, the Perseids. In later Greek mythology, Mycenae had a period where two kings ruled, and archeologists have suggested that these dual graves may correspond to both kings.
Background
During the end of the 3rd millennium BC (circa 2200 BC), the indigenous inhabitants of mainland Greece underwent a cultural transformation attributed to climate change, local events and developments (i.e. destruction of the "House of the Tiles"), as well as to continuous contacts with various areas such as western Asia Minor, the Cyclades, Albania, and Dalmatia. These Bronze Age people were equipped with horses, surrounded themselves with luxury goods, and constructed elaborate shaft graves. The acropolis of Mycenae, one of the leading centers of Mycenaean culture, located in Argolis, northeast Peloponnese, was built on a defensive hill at an elevation of 128 m (420 ft) and covers an area of 30,000 m2 (320,000 sq ft). The Shaft Graves found in Mycenae signified the elevation of a local Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.
History
Mycenaean shaft graves are essentially an Argive variant of the Middle Helladic funerary tradition with features derived from the Early Bronze Age developed locally in mainland Greece. Grave Circle A, formed circa 1600 BC as a new elite burial place, was probably first restricted to men and seems to be a continuation of the earlier Grave Circle B and correlates with the general social trend of higher burial investment taking place throughout entire Greece that time. The Grave Circle A site was part of a more significant funeral place from the Middle Helladic period. During the Late Helladic I (1600 BC), there might have been a small unfortified palace on Mycenae, while the Mycenaean ruling family graves remained outside the city walls. There is no evidence of a circular wall around the site during the period of the burials. The last interment took place circa 1500 BC.
Immediately after the last interment, the local rulers abandoned the shaft graves in favor of a new and more imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double-ring peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenaean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty. Under this context, the land was constructed to create a level precinct for ceremonies and re-erected the stelae. A new entrance, the Lion Gate, was constructed near the site.
Finds
Grave Circle A, with a diameter of 27.5 m (90 ft), is situated on the acropolis of Mycenae southeast of the Lion Gate. The Grave Circle contains six shaft graves, the smallest of which is measured at 3.0 m by 3.5 m and the largest measured at 4.50 m by 6.40 m (the depth of each shaft grave ranges from 1.0 m to 4.0 m). Over each grave, a mound was constructed, and stelae were erected. These stelae had been probably erected in memory of the Mycenaean rulers buried there; three of them depict chariot scenes.
A total of nineteen bodies – eight men, nine women, and two children – were found in the shafts. The shafts contained two to five bodies each, except for Grave II, which was a single burial. Between Graves IV and V, five golden masks were unearthed, including the Mask of Agamemnon discovered in Grave V. Boars' tusks were found in Grave IV. Additionally, gold and silver cups were discovered, including the Silver Siege Rhyton. Several gold rings, buttons, and bracelets were also found. Most of the graves were equipped with full sets of weapons, especially swords, and the figural depictions of the objects show fighting and hunting scenes. The gender of those entombed here were distinguished based on the grave goods that they were buried with them. Men were found with weapons while women received jewelry.
Many objects were designed to signify the social ranking of the deceased, for instance, decorated daggers, which were art objects and cannot be considered real weapons. Ornate staffs, as well as a scepter from Grave IV, clearly indicate a very significant status of the deceased. Items such as bulls' heads with a double-axe display clear Minoan influences. At the time that the Grave Circle was built, the Mycenaeans had not yet conquered Minoan Crete. Although it seems that they recognized the Minoans as the providers of the finest design and craftsmanship, most of the objects buried in Grave Circle A were decorated in the Minoan style. On the other hand, specific motifs such as fighting and hunting scenes are clearly of Mycenaean style. The combination of luxury goods found at this site represented many different societies of the time. This was an example of an "international style," which means countries would use the basic technology of one society and modify it to fit the standard imagery of their society.
Excavations
The site of Mycenae was the first in Greece to be subjected to a modern archaeological excavation. The German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann excavated it in 1876. Schliemann, inspired by Homer's descriptions in the Iliad, in which Mycenae is termed "abounding in gold," began digging there. He was also following the accounts of the ancient geographer Pausanias who described the once-prosperous site and mentioned that according to a local tradition during the 2nd century AD. The grave of Agamemnon included his followers, his charioteer Eurymedon and the two children of Cassandra, all of whom were buried within the citadel. What Schliemann discovered in his excavation satisfied both his opinion of Homer's historical accuracy and his craving for valuable treasures. Among the objects he unearthed in Grave Circle A was a series of gold death masks, including one he proclaimed "The Death Mask of Agamemnon." Schliemann cleared five shafts and recognized them as the graves mentioned by Pausanias. He stopped after the fifth grave was excavated entirely, believing that he had finished exploring the Grave Circle. However, a year later, Panagiotis Stamatakis found a sixth shaft grave.
It has since been demonstrated that the burials in Grave Circle A date from 16th century BC, before the traditional time of the Trojan War (13th-12th century BC), in which Agamemnon is supposed to have participated.

Ledian Memushaj (born 7 December 1986) is an Albanian professional football coach and a former central midfielder. He is the head coach of the Under-19 squad of the Italian club Pescara.
Club career
Early career
Memushaj joined A.S.D. Sarzanese Calcio 1906 when he was 17 years old. He helped the team finish second in Eccellenza Liguria in 2006 and gain promotion to Serie D. In the summer of 2008, he moved to fellow Serie D side Valle d'Aosta, where he played 34 games and scored 3 goals. On 10 September 2009, he signed for Paganese to play in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione after a trial.
Chievo and Portogruaro (loan)
On 21 June 2010, he was signed by Serie A side Chievo Verona on a free transfer. He was loaned out to Serie B side Portogruaro on 29 January 2011.
Lecce
On 27 July 2012, Memushaj left Carpi and moved to Serie B side Lecce on a three-year contract. However, before he even kicked a ball for his new club, they were relegated to the Lega Pro Prima Divisione after being expelled from Serie B for their part in the Calcio Scommesse scandal.
Memushaj scored his first goal for Lecce on 3 September 2012 in a 3–2 victory against Cremonese. He scored his team's 3rd goal of the match in the 31st minute with a shot from 20 meters out. On 23 September 2012, he scored Lecce's third goal in its 1–3 victory at Treviso, which took them to the top of the 2012–13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione League table.
Loan to Carpi
On 27 July 2013, Carpi announced that they had signed Memushaj on loan from Lecce for the 2013–14 season of Serie B. This transfer happened shortly after Carpi signed the fellow Albania national team player, Edgar Çani. This was his second spell with Carpi.
He became a key player for Carpi and made crucial contributions each week, scoring regularly. His first goal during this spell at Carpi came in extra time of the 0–1 away victory against Reggina on 28 September 2013. On 26 October 2013, he scored a goal against Latina from the penalty spot at the start of the second half to give his team a 1–1 draw. On 21 December 2013, he scored from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute to give his team a narrow 1–0 victory against Palermo. This victory resulted in Palermo surrendering first place to Empoli. On 26 December 2013 he scored an equaliser at Virtus Lanciano before two further goals from teammates left Carpi three points away from the play-off zone for promotion to Serie A. He started 2014 with a goal to continue his excellent form from the first half of the season. He scored in the 20th minute of the first half against Ternana at home on 25 January 2014, but this was not enough to avoid defeat. It was his fifth goal of the season and despite this defeat, his team were only three points away from the play-off zone for promotion.
In the 2013–14 season, Memushaj played in total 33 Serie B matches in where he scored 8 goals. He also played in a single match for the 2013–14 Coppa Italia.
On 6 May 2014, Memushaj tore a right knee ligament in a match against Pescara and had to undergo surgery. He was unable to play for 6 months.
Return to Lecce
Carpi did not accept the request of Lecce to buy Memushaj for a fee of €400,000, so he returned to Lecce.
Pescara
On 1 September 2014 Memushaj signed for the Serie B club Pescara on 1-year contract.
Due to the injury he suffered in May 2014, he missed Pescara's first 7 matches of the 2014–15 Serie B season. He made it his debut on 12 October 2014 by coming on as a substitute for Gabriel Appelt Pires in the 87th minute against Crotone; Pescara won the match, 1–4. He was an unused substitute for the next week match on 17 October 2014 against Vicenza (1–1), but a week later Memushaj started in the match against his previous team Carpi, but the match finished as a bad loss with a 0–5 result. A week later, Memushaj scored his first goal for Pescara in a 1–1 draw against Bari. On 27 December 2015, Memushaj scored the winning goal in the game against U.S. Latina Calcio, but was subsequently sent off the pitch after kicking a microphone on the sidelines as part of his goal celebration.
Benevento
On 28 August 2017, Memushaj was signed on loan with Serie A club Benevento until the end of the 2017–18 season with a purchase obligation at the end of loan.
International career
Memushaj was called for the first time to the Albania national team in November 2010 by manager Josip Kuže for a friendly against Macedonia. He made his international debut during the match at Qemal Stafa Stadium, replacing Klodian Duro in the second half as the match ended in a goalless draw. He returned on the team on 9 February 2011 for their next friendly against Slovenia, earning his second cap in the process, again as a substitute, as Albania was defeated 1–2.
In November 2013, after a long absence, Memushaj returned to the team with De Biasi as their manager for the friendly match against Belarus following the end of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. He was again used as a substitute in place of Valdet Rama in another scoreless draw.
UEFA Euro 2016 campaign
Memushaj missed the first two UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers matches against Portugal and Denmark due to an injury suffered in May 2014 while representing Carpi, an injury which sidelined him for 6 months. He also missed the notorious match against Serbia in October 2014. As soon as he was declared fit, he was called up for the friendlies against France and Italy in November 2014. He played his first match as a starter against France as Albania earned a historic 1–1 draw at Roazhon Park. He also featured as starter in Albania's first ever match against Italy, missing an opportunity to score in the first half as Albania slumped into a 1–0 away defeat.
Memushaj continued to be part of Albania in their historic UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. In the final decisive match against Armenia, he assisted the second goal via a set piece as Albania won 3–0 to secure a spot at UEFA Euro 2016, its first ever appearance at a major men's football tournament. On 21 May 2016, he was named in Albania's preliminary 27-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, and in Albania's final 23-man UEFA Euro 2016 squad on 31 May.
In the tournament, he did not play in the Albania's first Group A match against Switzerland, which finished in a 0–1 loss. However, he returned to the lineup in the second match against hosts France, hitting the post before Albania conceded two goals in the last minutes. In the final match against Romania, he assisted Armando Sadiku's header for the only goal of the match, helping earn Albania's first win at a major men's football tournament and beating Romania for the first time since 1948. Albania was eliminated from the tournament after finishing third in its group with three points and a goal difference of –2, ranking last among third-placed teams.
2018 FIFA World Cup campaign
Memushaj scored his first international goal on 11 June 2017 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Israel, netting the third in an eventual 3–0 away win.
Post-playing career
Memushaj retired from playing at the end of the 2021–22 season and was appointed head coach of the Under-19 squad of Pescara.
Personal life
He and his family migrated to Italy in 1997 due to civil war in Albania.

There are eight capital cities in Australia, each of which functions as the seat of government for the state or territory in which it is located. One of these, Canberra, is also the national capital. Section 125 of the Constitution of Australia specified that the seat of the national government, that is, the national capital, would be in its own territory within New South Wales, at least 100 miles from Sydney. The Constitution specified that until this national capital was ready, the Parliament would sit in Melbourne. In 1927, the national capital was finally ready and the national government relocated from its former seat in Melbourne to Canberra within the Australian Capital Territory (or the Federal Capital Territory as it was known at the time).
In each state and internal territory, the capital is also the jurisdiction's most populous city. The Australian external territory of Norfolk Island has its official capital at Kingston, although this acts merely as the administrative centre of government; its de facto capital is Burnt Pine.

Venezuela is divided into 23 states (estados), 1 Capital District (Distrito Capital) and the Federal Dependencies (Dependencias Federales de Ultramar) that consist of numerous Venezuelan islands. These administrative divisions are grouped into regions.
Historical subdivisions
Prior to the Federal War (1859–1863), Venezuela was divided into provinces rather than states. The victorious forces were supposed to grant more autonomy to the individual states, but this was not implemented.
Between 1863 and the early 1900s, there were numerous territorial changes, including the merger and splitting of states. Thereafter, until the late 1990s, the states were left unchanged. Recent years have seen the creation of three new states: Delta Amacuro, Amazonas, and Vargas (in that order).

Federal Dependencies
Municipal organization
Venezuelan states are subdivided into "municipalities" (Spanish municipios), which may correspond to either or both of county and city in English-speaking countries. Municipios are the fundamental unit of local government in Venezuela.

The 78th Air Base Wing is a wing of the United States Air Force stationed at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. The 78th acts as the host unit at Robins.
The wing was first activated as the 78th Fighter Wing in September 1948 as part of the wing base reorganization. It performed air defense duties on the Pacific Coast until 1952, when it was inactivated in a general reorganization of Air Defense Command. The wing was again activated in 1956 and continued the air defense mission until 1969.
In 1972, Air Training Command replaced its MAJCON 3560th Pilot Training Wing at Webb Air Force Base with the unit, then designated the 78th Flying Training Wing. The wing continued to train pilots at Webb until 1977, when Webb was closed.

History

Air Defense Command
On 24 September 1948 the 78th Fighter Wing was established at Hamilton Air Force Base, California by the Hobson Plan, with the 78th Fighter Group becoming a component of the wing, controlling its flying resources
Redesignated the 78th Fighter-Interceptor Wing in January 1950 as part of Air Defense Command. The group's squadrons (82d, 83d, 84th FIS) flew numerous interceptors for West Coast air defense. Inactivated on 6 February 1952 as part of a reorganization of ADC, its operational element was replaced by the 4702d Defense Wing. Its support elements were replaced at Hamilton by the 566th Air Base Group the same day. This group was redesignated the 566th Air Defense Group and assumed operational responsibilities at Hamilton on 16 February 1953. On 18 August 1955, the 566th Air Defense Group was replaced by a former element of the wing, the 78th Fighter Group (Air Defense).
In 1956, it was decided to elevate the operational units at Hamilton back to a Wing level, and the wing was reactivated, with its operational squadrons still controlled by the 78th Fighter Group. The group component of the wing was considered to be a redundant level of organization by the late 1950s, and the 78th FIG was inactivated on 1 February 1961, with its flying units being directly assigned to the Wing.
The 78th Fighter Wing was the host unit at Hamilton until it was inactivated at the end of December 1969 and its mission, equipment were transferred to the 1st Fighter Wing, which transferred to Hamilton on paper from Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan.
Air Training Command
The 78th Flying Training Wing replaced and absorbed resources of the 3560th Pilot Training Wing at Webb Air Force Base, Texas, on 1 December 1972. Squadrons were 82d, 83d, 3389th Flying Training Sqdns. The wing performed pilot training for both USAF and allied officers.
In 1977 the end of the Vietnam War meant a decrease in the need for Air Force pilots and Webb was closed. The 78th FTW was inactivated.
In 1989 the Dutch government allowed USAF to upgrade its headquarters unit at Soesterberg AB from squadron to group status. The story goes that the USAF wanted to change the 32d into the 78th TFG but that the Dutch government didn't allow another number as not to stir up the people who were against the American presence in the Netherlands.
Robins AFB
Since its reactivation in 1994, the 78th Air Base Wing has provided host services and support for the Warner-Robins Air Logistics Center and its tenant organizations.

John Deacon Bates (born October 11, 1946) is a Senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He was appointed by President George W. Bush in December 2001, and has adjudicated several cases directly affecting the office of the President. Bates served as Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, from July 1, 2013 to January 5, 2015, after which he returned to full-time service as a District Judge.
Personal life and education
Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Bates graduated from the Pingry School in 1964. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wesleyan University in 1968, and a Juris Doctor from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1976. From 1968 to 1971, he served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army. He and his wife, Carol Ann Rhees, also a former lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson LLP, live in Bethesda, Maryland. They have three children.
Career
Bates was a law clerk for Judge Roszel Cathcart Thomsen of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland from 1976 to 1977 and was an associate at Steptoe & Johnson from 1977 to 1980. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 1980 to 1987, and was Chief of the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office from 1987 to 1997. Bates was on detail as Deputy Independent Counsel for the Whitewater investigation from 1995 to mid-1997. In 1998, he joined the Washington, D.C. law firm of Miller & Chevalier, where he was Chair of the Government Contracts/Litigation Department and a member of the Executive Committee. From September 1995 until leaving in March 1997, Bates worked as Deputy Independent Counsel for Kenneth Starr and the Independent Counsel's office during the investigation into President Bill Clinton.
District Court service
On September 4, 2001, Bates was nominated by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, vacated by Stanley S. Harris. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 11, 2001, and received his commission on December 14, 2001. Bates took senior status on October 12, 2014. Bates has served on the Advisory Committee for Procedures of the D.C. Circuit and on the Civil Justice Reform Committee for the District Court, and as Treasurer of the District of Columbia Bar, Chairman of the Publications Committee of the D.C. Bar, and Chairman of the Litigation Section of the Federal Bar Association. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. In 2005, he was appointed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to serve on the Judicial Conference of the United States' Committee on Court Administration and Case Management (CACM). In February 2006, he was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve as a judge of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court).
Notable rulings
On August 3, 2018 Judge Bates ruled that "the Trump administration did not justify its decision to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA" and ordered DACA to be reinstated. He gave the administration 20 days to appeal.
On April 24, 2018, Judge Bates ruled that the Trump administration must resume accepting new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) but stayed his decision for 90 days to allow the Department of Homeland Security to explain why DACA was being canceled.
On January 23, 2017, Judge Bates blocked the $37 billion merger between health insurance companies Aetna and Humana, saying the deal would hurt competition and raise prices for consumers.
On October 25, 2016, Judge Bates dismissed freed Guantanamo Bay detention camp prisoner Shawali Khan's petition for habeas corpus as moot. Khan had opposed the dismissal, arguing that, because his detention had never been declared illegal, his past as a U.S. prisoner was preventing him from getting medical treatment for injuries suffered during his imprisonment. While dismissing Khan's lawsuit, Bates wrote he was nevertheless "sympathetic to the pickle".
On March 19, 2014, Judge Bates in Innovator Enterprises, Inc v Jones found for the plaintiff and vacated BATFE's classification of the company's "stabilizer brake" as a "firearm silencer".Hypotheticals further illustrate the weakness of this methodology. A mouse is not an "elephant" solely because it has three characteristics that are common to known elephants: a tail, gray skin, and four legs. A child's bike is not a "motorcycle" solely because it has three characteristics common to known motorcycles: two rubber tires, handlebars, and a leather seat. And a Bud Light is not "Single-Malt Scotch," just because it is frequently served in a glass container, contains alcohol, and is available for purchase at a tavern. To close with a firearm-related example: a hockey puck is not a "rubber bullet," just because it has rounded sides, is made of vulcanized rubber, and is capable of causing injury when launched at high speeds. Learning that one object has three characteristics in common with some category may not be very helpful in determining whether the object in question belongs in that category.
In November 2013, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declassified and released a circa-July 2010 (date classified) FISC ruling by Judge Bates authorizing the National Security Agency to restart mass collection of internet metadata, including those of U.S. citizens. Bates noted that the NSA had been violating provisions of various laws, but nevertheless decided to allow the government to continue many aspects of the mass surveillance program. Critics of encroaching U.S. security state policies, in a nod to the Bates numbering method used in the legal field, appropriated the "Bates stamp" moniker as a neologism to refer to often uncritical FISC scrutiny of U.S. government conduct when considering Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications.
On December 10, 2010, Bates dismissed a challenge to President Barack Obama's targeted killing order against Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a dual American and Yemeni citizen with ties to al-Qaeda. Bates ruled that al-Awlaki's father, Nasser al-Awlaki, who filed the suit with assistance by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, lacked legal standing in the case against the Obama Administration. Bates stopped short of granting the executive branch "unreviewable authority" to order the killing of an American citizen, instead concluding that the case would likely be settled in another forum outside the courtroom.
On July 31, 2008, Bates ruled, in a dispute between the Administrative and Legislative branches, that President George W. Bush's advisers, chief of staff Josh Bolten and former legal counsel Harriet Miers, are not immune from congressional subpoenas to testify about the firing of nine U.S. attorneys and turn over all related, non-privileged documents.
As a District Court Judge, Bates dismissed the GAO's effort to learn with whom Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force conferred.
On July 19, 2007, he dismissed a lawsuit filed by Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband against Vice President Dick Cheney, White House political adviser Karl Rove, former White House aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby and former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. Plame's lawyers had said from the beginning of the lawsuit that it would be quite difficult to win, since public officials and servants are generally immune from such suits filed in connection with their jobs. Plame's identity as a Central Intelligence Agency field operative was revealed in a syndicated newspaper column in 2003. This revelation coincided with (Plame's husband) Wilson's criticism of the Bush administration's policy in Iraq. Many of the administration's opponents questioned the timing of the leak of Plame's identity, and assign blame of the leak to officials in the administration. Although several administration officials were questioned in an investigation of the leak, no formal charges were brought, and Libby was then found guilty of lying and obstruction of the investigation as a consequence of his lying. President George W. Bush subsequently commuted Libby's jail sentence as unduly harsh. In April 2018, President Donald Trump fully pardoned Libby.
Bates stated in his ruling that the couple's allegations "pose important questions relating to the propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials," but that he had to dismiss their claims for jurisdictional reasons. While saying the Bush administration officials' actions "may have been highly unsavory", Bates nonetheless ruled "there can be no serious dispute" that speaking to the press to rebut Wilson's criticism was "within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials." The Wilsons appealed.
In a December 30, 2002 decision, Bates of the U.S. District Court ruled that lead plaintiff Representative Dennis Kucinich and 31 other members of the United States House of Representatives have no standing to challenge President Bush's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty without congressional approval. He also ruled that the case presents a "political question" not suitable for resolution by the courts."

Ivan Lukyanovich Solonevich (, 13 November 1891, Ciechanowiec, then Grodno Governorate, Imperial Russia — 24 April 1953, Montevideo, Uruguay) was a Russian philosopher, historian, writer, editor, publisher, publicist and conservative political activist.
A member of the White movement during the Russian Civil War and later of the anti-Soviet underground in Ukraine, Solonevich was persecuted and jailed. He spent 1920s and early 1930s as a sports official, photographer and journalist, all the while looking for the opportunity to leave the country. After several failed attempts he finally succeeded in 1934 and spent the rest of his life in emigration, first in Finland, then Bulgaria, Germany, Argentine (where he founded the newspaper Nasha Strana, Our Country) and Uruguay.
Solonevich authored several acclaimed books on Russian monarchy (The Assassins of the Tzar, 1938; The Myth about Nicholas the Second, 1949) and political repressions in the USSR (Russia in Concentration Camp, 1935). His best-known work is People's Monarchy (1951) in which he fully developed his doctrine of monarchy being the only viable and historically justified political system for Russia.

Detroit East Catholic High School (short form: "East Catholic", or "EC") was a co-educational college preparatory school in Detroit, Michigan and belonged to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit.
East Catholic was a member of the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) and competed athletically in the Catholic High School League (CHSL).
History
The school was formed in 1969 by a merger of St. Anthony High School (Detroit) and some other Catholic schools. In the 1970s it had about 900 students, its peak enrollment. The population decreased since the area's socioeconomic profile became more low income and as Catholic families moved outside of Detroit. By the 2004-2005 school year, the student count was 124.
Athletic accomplishments
The East Catholic Chargers won seven Michigan High School Athletic Association state championships in boys basketball.
Closure
The school was closed in 2005 when Detroit East Catholic, along with St. Florian and Bishop Gallagher, formed Trinity Catholic High School as a collaborative.

The purple-throated sunbird (Leptocoma sperata), is a species of bird in the family Nectariniidae.
Its natural habitats are lowland tropical forests and subtropical or tropical mangrove forest of Maratua and the Philippines.
The Van Hasselt's sunbird was previously considered conspecific.
Taxonomy
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the purple-throated sunbird in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in the Philippines. He used the French name Le grimpereau pourpré des Philippines and the Latin Certhia Philippensis Purpurea. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the purple-throated sunbird. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Certhia sperata and cited Brisson's work. Linnaeus specified the type location as the Philippines but this was subsequently restricted to Manila. The specific name sperata is Latin for "bride" or "betrothed". The species is now placed in the genus Leptocoma that was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850.
Four subspecies are recognised:
L. s. henkei (Meyer, AB, 1884) – north Luzon
L. s. sperata (Linnaeus, 1766) – central and south Luzon, Polillo Island, Marinduque and Catanduanes (north Philippines)
L. s. trochilus (Salomonsen, 1953) – west, central and south Philippines (except west and south Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago)
L. s. juliae (Tweeddale, 1877) – west and south Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago

Political career
In the early 2000s, Sapam Keba and his team founded a political organisation called as “Progressive Committee Patsoi Kendra”. The goal of this organisation was to help augment the overall development of Patsoi assembly constituency. In the 2002 assembly election, this very organisation backed the CPI candidate Moirangthem Nabadwip Singh and won the Patsoi seat.
2002
Clarion call from the supporters of Sapam Keba of actual contesting the election grew louder and stronger in the run-up to the 2007 assembly election. After much thought and deliberations, Sapam Keba took the plunge and announced his candidature for the 2007 Assembly Election. He took an independent stand and stood as an independent candidate. Amongst the candidates included the veteran politician, former Speaker and also the former Deputy Chief Minister Dr. L.Chandramani Singh and others. He won the election by a margin of 1644 votes and was termed as a “Giant Killer” by the local media.

Pig Heaven/Slaughter the Grey is the second EP by White Zombie, independently released as an EP in May 1986. Two different pressings of this album were created (the only differences between the two being the different guitarists and the altered cover art), both of which were limited to 500 copies each. By this time drummer Peter Landau was replaced by Ivan de Prume, who would remain with the band until Astro-Creep: 2000, and guitarist Paul "Ena" Kostabi by Tim Jeffs.
Recording
Although only "Pig Heaven" and "Slaughter the Grey" were released, the band also recorded "Scarecrow #2 (a remake of "Tales From The Scarecrow Man" from Gods on Voodoo Moon)", "Rain Insane", "Paradise Fireball", and "Red River Flow" in the same session. These songs were officially released on It Came From NYC. A bulk of the material was recorded in roughly two hours.

Inosine triphosphate (ITP) is an intermediate in the purine metabolism pathway, seen in the synthesis of ATP and GTP. It comprises an inosine nucleotide containing three phosphate groups esterified to the sugar moiety.
ITP results from deamination of ATP. Incorporation of ITP into the DNA from the nucleotide pool can lead to DNA damage, mutagenesis and other harmful effects. ITP is processed by the enzyme inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA), which turns it into inosine monophosphate (IMP), to avoid incorporation into DNA.

Porrentruy Castle is a castle in the municipality of Porrentruy of the Canton of Jura in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
Construction of the castle took place between the mid-thirteenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth century. The oldest part is the thirteenth century Réfous Tower (Tour Réfous). Fourteenth century ramparts survive on the western and northern sides.
Since 1271 belonging to the bishopric of Basel, the castle served as exile residence of the prince-bishops of Basel from 1527 until 1792. The bishops had been exiled from Basel during the Swiss Reformation in 1529, whereas they were able to keep most of their territories outside the city.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Romanesque chapel within the castle walls was destroyed.

Girolamo Benivieni (; 6 February 1453 – August 1542) was a Florentine poet and a musician. His father was a notary in Florence. He suffered poor health most of his life, which prevented him from taking a more stable job. He was a leading member of the Medicean Academy, a society devoted to literary study. He was a friend of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), whom he met for the first time in 1479; it was Pico della Mirandola who encouraged him to study Neoplatonism. In the late 1480s, he and Pico della Mirandola became students of Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola (1452–1498). In 1496, he translated the teachings of Savonarola from Italian to Latin. After he began following Savonarola, he rejected his earlier poetry and attempted to write more spiritually. He participated in Savonarola's Bonfire of the Vanities, and documented the destruction of art worth "several thousand ducats".
He was supported in his writing by noblewoman Lucrezia de' Medici (1470–1553). They were both interested in the works of poet Dante Alighieri (1265–1321). In 1506, Benivieni published an edition of the Divine Comedy with maps by Antonio Manetti (1423–1497) and commentary by Manetti and Benivieni. In March 1515 Benivieni drafted a letter to be sent from Lucrezia to her brother, Pope Leo X (s. 1513–21), seeking his assistance in bringing the body of Dante back to Florence. On 20 October 1519, Benivieni signed a Medicean Academy petition to Pope Leo, again requesting the return of Dante from Ravenna. Benivieni also used his connection with Lucrezia to advance his ideas on church reform with her brother, and later with her cousin, Pope Clement VII (s. 1523–34). In 1530, he wrote a letter to Pope Clement in defense of Savonarola, seeking to have his reputation restored within the church. He is buried together with Giovanni Pico della Mirandola at San Marco, Florence, Italy.

Nambisha is a village located south of Ukhrul in Ukhrul district, Manipur state, India. The village falls under Kamjong sub division. Nambisha is connected by Ukhrul-Kamjong state highway. The village is flanked by Punge in the west, Kangpat in the south, Kongkan Thana in the east and Ningchou in the north. Locally, the inhabitants speak Nambisha dialect that belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family. Some researchers are of the view that the dialect spoken by the inhabitants has some affinity to that of the Koireng tribe.
Total population
According to 2011 census, Nambisha has 92 households with the total of 601 people of which 290 are male and 311 are female. Of the total population, 87 were in the age group of 0–6 years. The average sex ratio of the village is 1072 female to 1000 male which is higher than the state average 985. The literacy rate of the village stands at 99.61% which is higher than the state average 76.94%. Male literacy rate stands at 100% while female literacy rate was 98.25%.
People and occupation
The village is home to people of Tangkhul Naga tribe. Majority of the inhabitants are Christians and Nambisha and Bungpa hold the record of appointing women pastors in the 1940s; a rare historical privilege in a predominantly patriarchal society. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the inhabitants. Being a remote area, the village is often in the news for the poor transport system due to bad road condition and the inhabitants suffer most during the rainy season because of frequent landslides. Nambisha is close to the porous Indo-Myanmar international border and the village is often used as transit route by militants for which there are frequent encounters between the Indian arm force and militant groups.

Ashby Creek is a tributary of Doctors Creek in Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey, in the United States. It runs for from the area near Wrightsville and empties into Doctors Creek southeast of Allentown.
Course
From its mouth near Wrightsville within Upper Freehold Township, the creek briefly heads west through farmland, then south into a wooded area where it crosses under Interstate 195 (I-195) west of its interchange 11. The creek is impounded forming an unnamed lake before continuing west through woods and farmland staying just to the south of I-195. It passes under the Union Transportation Trail (formerly the Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad) and Sharon Station Road. Continuing to wind towards the west through farmland, it is again impounded within an unnamed lake between a farm and small residences. Downstream of this dam, the creek passes under Allentown-Lakewood Road (County Route 526) then continuing southwest through woods situated between two housing developments. Ashby Creek flows into Doctors Creek about southeast of downtown Allentown.
Name
The creek had been known as Negro Run or a variation of that since the 1700s. The name may have been intended to honor fugitive slaves who passed through the area on the Underground Railroad. It was also known as Nigger Run by the 1800s. It was noted as Nigger Run on the Allentown United States Geological Survey topographic map by 1948, but had been officially renamed to Negro Run in 1957, around the time other similarly offensive names were changed by the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN).
In the 1990s, a local resident submitted several proposals to change the name of Negro Run to Martin Luther King Jr. Creek or Freedom Creek. The change were opposed by local residents and governments, wanting to keep the more historical name. Historic research found that George Ashby (1844–1946), a black farmer who had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, lived and worked near the creek. Ashby was also New Jersey's last surviving Civil War veteran. Following the creation of a park in Allentown in 2016, a local resident launched an online petition drive to rename the creek for Ashby. Though some opposition still existed from local historic societies and the Upper Freehold Township council, the BGN Domestic Naming Committee at their November 2018 meeting voted 11–1 to rename the creek to Ashby Creek.

Eaglenest or Eagle's Nest Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area of India in the Himalayan foothills of West Kameng District, Arunachal Pradesh. It conjoins Sessa Orchid Sanctuary to the northeast and Pakhui Tiger Reserve across the Kameng river to the east. Altitude ranges are extreme: from to . It is a part of the Kameng Elephant Reserve.
Eaglenest is notable as a prime birding site due to the extraordinary variety, numbers and accessibility of species.
Eaglenest derives its name from Red Eagle Division of the Indian army which was posted in the area in the 1950s.
Geography and climate
Eaglenest and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary together occupy a rough east–west rectangle with Sessa occupying the northeast quadrant. Eaglenest is bounded to the north by Eaglenest Ridge and the reserved forests of the Bugun community (Lama Camp area). Eaglenest adjoins Tawang district to the north. The Bhalukpong–Bomdila highway (and Pakke immediately beyond) are its eastern boundary. There are no distinct geographical features delineating its western boundary along the Bhutan border and the southern boundary at about 27° N latitude.
Eaglenest and Sessa ridges rise to and respectively and are the first major barriers to the monsoon as it moves north from the plains of Assam. These ridges get over of rain on the southern slopes and about on the northern ones.
The eastern half of Eaglenest and Sessa sanctuaries is drained by the Tippi Naala (Tippi river) which joins the Kameng river at Tippi village on the Bhalukpong–Bomdila highway. Several smaller streams including Buhiri Nadi and Dihung Nadi in the western half of the area flow down to join the Brahmaputra separately.
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is part of the Kameng protected area complex (KPAC), the largest contiguous closed-canopy forest tract of Arunachal Pradesh, which includes Eaglenest, Pakke, Sessa, Nameri, and Sonai Rupai sanctuaries and associated reserved forest blocks. The complex covers 3500 km2 in area and ranges from to in altitude.
Eaglenest has an unpaved road running from its base to Eaglenest pass at allowing good access to the entire altitudinal range, making it accessible to the military, scientists and ecotourists.
Fauna
Birds
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is well known as a major birding area. It is home to at least 454 species of birds including 3 cormorants, 5 herons, black stork, Oriental white (black-headed) ibis, 4 ducks, 20 hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and vultures, 3 falcons, 10 pheasants, junglefowl, quail, and peafowl, black-necked crane, 3 rails, 6 plovers, dotterels, and lapwings, 7 waders, ibisbill, stone-curlew (Eurasian thick-knee), small pratincole, 2 gulls, 14 pigeons, 3 parrots, 15 cuckoos, 10 owls, 2 nightjars, 4 swifts, 2 trogons, 7 kingfishers, 2 bee-eaters, 2 rollers, hoopoes, 4 hornbills, 6 barbets, 14 woodpeckers, 2 broadbills, 2 pittas, 2 larks, 6 martins, 7 wagtails, 9 shrikes, 9 bulbuls, 4 fairy-bluebirds, 3 shrikes, brown dipper, 3 accentors, 46 thrushes, 65 Old World flycatchers, 6 parrotbills, 31 warblers, 25 flycatchers, 10 tits, 5 nuthatches, 3 treecreepers, 5 flowerpeckers, 8 sunbirds, Indian white-eye, 3 bunting, 14 finches, 2 munia, 3 sparrows, 5 starlings, 2 orioles, 7 drongos, ashy woodswallow and 9 jays. The sanctuary has the distinction of having three tragopan species, perhaps unique in India.
Eaglenest is the site where Bugun liocichla was first discovered in 1995 and again observed and described in 2006 by Ramana Athreya.
Herpetofauna
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is home to a wide variety of herpetofauna including at least 34 species of amphibians, 24 species of snakes and 7 species of lizards including 3 geckos, 3 agamids and 4 skinks. Abor Hills agama was rediscovered at Eaglenest after 125 years. Other rare species include the Darjeeling false-wolfsnake which was only known to science through five specimens, Anderson's mountain lizard, Günther's kukri snake, common slug snake, and keelback snakes which have not been definitively identified.
Mammals
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary provides habitat to clouded leopard, marbled cat, Asian golden cat and leopard cat.
Other mammal species include the endangered capped langur, red panda, Asiatic black bear and the vulnerable Arunachal macaque and gaur. It was here that a new taxon of primate was discovered in 1997 by noted primatologist of northeast India Dr Anwaruddin Choudhury, but he thought it to be a new subspecies of Tibetan or Pere David's macaque. It was described as a new species, i.e., Arunachal macaque in 2004. The highest elevation (11,000 ft) that the wild Asian elephants reach anywhere is partly in this sanctuary.
Butterflies
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is home to at least 165 species of butterflies including Bhutan glory, grey admiral, scarce red-forester, dusky labyrinth, tigerbrown, jungle-queen sp, white-edged bushbrown, and white owl.
Flora
In Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary there is a camp named Sessni which in Nepali language means nettle. The place is filled with poisonous elephant nettles on either side of the road.
Conservation
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is physically protected from timber and animal poaching only by its isolation and the poor quality of the one lane road leading inside it. It is administered by the Divisional Forest Officer, Shergaon Forest Division, Rupa (Millo Tasser, IFS). He is assisted by a Range Forest Office in Singchung and Beat Forest Offices in Ramalingam (close to Singchung) and Khellong. The absence of any settlement inside Eaglenest has minimized any problem of hunting.
The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), a consortium of major international and regional organizations, has identified the Eastern Himalayan region around Arunachal Pradesh (Nepal, Bhutan and all of Northeast India) as a critical global biodiversity rich area deserving of conservation focus. They identified the North Bank Landscape (i.e., north bank of Brahmaputra, extending up the Eaglenest slopes) and the Tawang region as worthy of particular focus.
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is in the Conservation International Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot area.
BirdLife International has designated Eaglenest and Sessa sanctuaries as an Important Bird Area (IBA IN344), with Blyth's tragopan identified as a vulnerable species of the area.
This area is extremely important for the continued well-being of the Asian elephant. Elephants regularly move up from the Assam plains to the Eaglenest ridge at 3250 m in summer, perhaps the highest altitude that elephants reach in India. Extensive clearing of forests through illegal encroachments in Assam adjacent to Eaglenest has exacerbated elephant-human conflict in the plains; it has also meant that elephants now have to stay longer in the Eaglenest area and may lead to depletion of their food resource by exceeding the rate of regeneration.

The Officer Training School is a Republic of Korea Air Force commissioning program held at the Republic of Korea Air Force Education and Training Command, Jinju. It is a part of Basic Military Training Wing. The current Commander, Air Force Education and Training Command is Maj Gen Jaewon Yoon.
The OTS is the largest commissioning source in the ROKAF for junior officers, Korea Air Force Academy being second and ROTC third.
Interested applicants sit for the Air Force Officer Selection Test which covers college level topics related to the specific major areas one is applying. The undergraduate GPA and the Korean college entrance exam score are usually not considered. There are different admission quotas for women, pilot candidates, academy lecturers, judge advocates and language specialists (also known as interpreter officers).
Basic Officer Training
Excluding the first week of orientation, BOT is a 15-week course for college graduates pursuing a commission in the ROKAF. The platoon and flight leaders who are usually lieutenants and captains are responsible for much of the in-processing and administration for the orientation week. The class is organized into the OT Wing, OT Squadrons (usually three)),and OT Flights (one or more per squadron depending on class size). BOT classes are designated by numerical sequence of their graduation (e.g., Class 108 means 108th Class). Trainees are given ranks of officer candidate.
Typically, personnel applying to BOT have baccalaureate level degrees in either technical or non-technical fields. Technical fields may include Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and other fields in high demand by the Air Force. Non-technical degrees are more common, and therefore applying with a degree in such a field is very competitive. Applicants can apply for rated or non-rated positions. Rated positions are flying related -- Pilot, Navigator, or Air Battle Manager. Non-rated fall into 2 categories: non-rated ops, such as Intelligence or Weather, and non-rated support, such as Maintenance, Logistics, or Communications.
Areas of instruction include military customs and courtesies, military history, leadership, officership, field exercises, drill and ceremonies, and small arms training.
The first eight weeks of training are geared toward indoctrination. The focus is on physical training, drill and ceremonies, and standardization. OTs will be expected to work with their fellow flight and squadron members to accomplish specific tasks as required by their Flight Commander. There are constant bullying by the drill instructors.
To graduate, OTs must exceed physical standards (OTs track and train to these standards), academic standards, and military bearing standards. Military bearing includes the ability to write and brief, lead the flight, and perform duties within the OT Wing.
Upon graduation, graduates become Second Lieutenants (O-1) in the Republic of Korea Air Force.
The History of OTS
There are total of 132 classes in the OTS so far.
OTS as compared to the Academy and ROTC
There are three ways to become an officer in the Republic of Korea Air Force which are the Korea Air Force Academy, Reserve Officer Training Corps, or Officer Training School.
Officer Training School is the most expedient way to become an officer in the Air Force. It is challenging, physically and mentally demanding, and is typically the route that many Korean males who did not serve his military obligation earlier takes. Graduates are nicknamed "short term" officer or "sa-hoo".
The Korea Air Force Academy is this most intense and in-depth training officer candidates can pursue. While at the academy, cadets are immersed into the Air Force way of life: field training exercises, flight training, and sports keep the cadets occupied. Graduates earn a Bachelor of Science degree in their chosen major. They are nicknamed "gongsa".
The Reserve Officer Training Corps is active at a few colleges in Korea. Upon completion of the program and receipt of their bachelor's degree, they are commissioned.
Each commissioning source produces a 2nd Lieutenant.

The Washington Heights Historic District is located in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The historic district includes 347 contributing properties that date from 1891-1950. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
History
The area was platted in 1888 and building construction began in 1891. It became a streetcar suburb along Washington's original city limits. The first streetcar was a horse-drawn line that terminated at Connecticut and Florida Avenues. The area's growth intensified when electric streetcars were built on 18th Street in 1892 and Columbia Road in 1896.
Washington Heights was primarily a white middle-class neighborhood until the early 1920s when immigrants from Europe and Asia began to move into the neighborhood. Many of the newcomers operated small businesses along 18th Street or worked in the embassies in the area. The African American population was originally limited to the servants and janitors who lived where they were employed. They started moving into their own residences in the area in the 1930s, especially along Vernon Street. Single family row houses were transformed into rooming houses. Racial attitudes regarding the changing demographics led to white flight for the suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s, which also depressed property values. At that time Spanish speaking residents began to move into the area because of its affordable housing and because of its proximity to the Latin American embassies. As turmoil gripped the Latin American countries in the 1960s their numbers began to swell in the neighborhood. The 1970s saw people from the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and Africa move into the neighborhood, which has made the neighborhood a multicultural and multinational mix of people.
Architecture
The architecture of the historic district is made up of late 19th century row houses that line the grid pattern streets and early 20th century apartment blocks that front the avenues. A variety of commercial structures are found along 18th Street NW.

The Cheshire Cup is an annual rugby union knock-out club competition organized by the Cheshire Rugby Football Union. It was first introduced in the 1877–78 season as the Cheshire Challenge County Cup and the inaugural competition was won by Birkenhead Park, who along with eight other local sides including New Brighton and Sale, made up the club members of the Cheshire RFU at that time. Four years later the cup was discontinued due to arguments over whether cup ties were beneficial to the county game. The Cheshire RFU reintroduced the cup during the 1969–70 season, with Sale the first winners of the competition in over 80 years.
The Cheshire Cup is currently the premier county cup competition for club sides in tier 4 (National League 2 North) and tier 5 (National League 3 North or National League 3 Midlands) of the English rugby union system that are based in either Cheshire, Merseyside or the Isle of Man. Originally it was the only men's county cup competition but plate, shield and bowl competitions have been introduced over the years for lower ranked clubs. The current format is as a knock-out cup with a quarter-final, semi-final and final which is held at a neutral venue during the latter stages of the season (March–May). At present Cheshire Cup finals are held on the same date and at the same venue as Cheshire Plate finals.

Philippine government securities (locally referred to as "GS") are the unconditional debt obligations of the Republic of the Philippines. These are all denominated in the local currency, the Philippine peso. The securities are issued by the Republic through its fiscal agent, the Bureau of Treasury.
Risk free securities
By convention, the risk-free interest rate is the yield that the investor can obtain by acquiring financial instruments with no default risk. In practice, finance professionals and academics classify government bonds denominated in the domestic currency of the issuing government as risk free because of the extremely low probability that the government will default on its own debt.
Tenors
Treasury Bills
Short-term (91, 182 and 364 days)
Yield determined at auction
Issued on a discount basis two days following the auction
Treasury Notes (2,3,4,5, & 7 years) and Bonds (10, 20 and 25 years)
Fixed coupon rate determined at auction
Issued at par two days following the auction
Interest-bearing; payable semi-annually
Government Securities Dealers
Financial institutions apply with the Bureau of Treasury for designation as authorized government securities dealers ("GSeDs"). As GSeDs, financial institutions are required to participate in every primary auction of GS. The GSeDs are ranked according to their volume winnings in the primary auction.
Under Philippine laws, GS are classified as securities which are exempt per se from SEC registration and automatically classified as registered securities upon issuance. Financial institutions duly registered with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission are automatically eligible to trade and distribute GS.
Registry of Scripless Securities ("RoSS")
Registry of Scripless Securities (RoSS) is the official record of absolute ownership, legal or beneficial title or interest in GS. Upon award of GS to a GSED at the auction, the securities award record are downloaded electronically into the GSED's Securities Principal Account in RoSS. Every sale of GS by a dealer reduces its Securities Principal Account in RoSS. Conversely, every purchase of GS by a GSED increases its Securities Principal Account in RoSS. The ownership/interest of secondary market buyer, trustee, pledgee, etc. of GS is recorded in the Securities Client Account in RoSS. The recording is done by merely keying-in the trade at the respective BIS terminals of the trade counter-parties and within seconds the trade information is received by the RoSS. At the end of trading hours, all matched trades (confirmed by both counterparties) are referred to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) for settlement (debit of GSED buyer and credit of GSED seller Demand Accounts). This completes the process of trading in the secondary market. This effectively conforms with the G-30 Recommendations of Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) through Netting but Same-Day-Settlement. (Taken from the Bureau of Treasury Website)
Background
The Registry of Scripless Securities ("RoSS") was established in November 1996 by the Bureau of the Treasury under then Treasurer of the Philippines, Caridad Valdehuesa. RoSS was implemented to respond and eliminate the operating risks posed by the issuance, trading, and transportation of certificated securities as highlighted by the Bancapital financial scandal of 1994.
Since all GS were certificated prior to the advent of RoSS, dealers resorted to the exchange of warehouse receipts rather than the physical movement of the certificates in the course of their trading activities. Bancapital conducted brokering operations based on these warehouse receipts and the 1994 scandal erupted when the physical count of certificates against warehouse receipts did not tally. The scandal was far reaching and threatened to collapse market confidence in the GS market.
The BTr facilitated the issuance of enabling regulations which did away with the need to issue GS in certificated form and allowed it to directly record new issuances within RoSS itself.
As the official register, RoSS is primarily tasked with monitoring and maintaining official records of ownership over GS. In addition, RoSS also monitors and administers GS coupon and principal payments. At the same time, as official register, the BTr can accommodate investors who have a particular need or requirement to have their ownership of GS directly known to the BTr.
Third Party Custodians
As part of its efforts to improve Philippine capital markets, the Philippine monetary authority, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, promulgated Circular 392 covering the delivery of securities. Prior to Circular 392, GSeDs could likewise perform custody services for investors that it sold GS to.
With Circular 392, investors are now required to designate third party securities custodians that will hold the securities in their name. In turn, the GSeDs are required to deliver securities that they have sold to investors into the investors' custody accounts. Circular 392 was devised to increase investor protection as the responsibility over custody and recordkeeping of investor holdings has been removed from the GSeDs.
Investors complying with Circular 392 have their record of ownership maintained by their third party custodians. RoSS records all GS safekept with third party custodians as owned by them. The individual investor accounts and their holdings are not recorded with RoSS.

Shorne Wood Country Park is located between Strood and Gravesend, in the English county of Kent. It was once part of a large estate, later passed to the county council to be used as a country park.
History
This park was once part of the large Cobham Hall Estate. The main entrance to the Hall, leads through the park with various other carriage rides around the estate.
Then from the 1930s to the 1970s, part of the estate (was leased by Lord Darnley) was used for clay extraction (by a cement company), using clay pit beneath the ancient woodland.
Then in 1987, the of land, came under ownership of Kent County Council, then with the help of Gravesham Borough Council, it was turned into a country park and then opened to the public.
Facilities
It has large areas of ancient woodland and heathland meadows. The former claypit is being returned to nature (with woodland and wetland areas).
The wetland ponds have many species of dragonflies, which breed in the park. A large part of the park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) with the designation Shorne and Ashenbank Woods.
The park also is accredited with a Green Flag Award by Natural England.
The country park has many colour-coded waymarked paths around the country park. These include; Purple Route - Easy 1.4 km, Red Route - Medium, Explorer Trail - 3.7miles, Heritage Trail - 2.2miles. A longer trail (the Darmley Trail - 6.2miles) has also been developed taking area outside of Shorne Wood park, including Darnley Mausoleum, Jeskyns (a one-time farm of 360 acres (147 ha), which is being turned into a greenspace area and country park by the Forestry Commission ), Ranscombe Farm and Cobham Hall.
There is also a horse riding and cycle path route around the park. As well as a Sensory Garden for the less abled.
Disabled visitors can also use 4*4 electro-scooters (called a Tramper), which can be hired from the visitor centre.
The park also has an eco-friendly visitor centre designed by Lee Evans Partnership and costing £1.6m. It as runner-up in 2007 Kent Design Awards. It was the first structure to be constructed using Sweet chestnut in the UK. The mainly sweetchestnut structure, also used Oak thinnings were used from Park Wood, Kent near Appledore, as the window and roof joinery.
It is mostly powered by a wind turbine. The centre has a shop, display boards and cafe.
To the east of the park, are the Furzey Leas Lakes. Steps Lake is , and Long Lake is These are used as angler permitted lakes, on Day Tickets (obtained from the visitor centre).
Since 2006, the park has had a Community Archaeologist as funded by the Heritage Lottery. Finds from the Stone Age (flint tools) to World War II items have been found. Most work has been taken place around the remains of Randall Manor. This was the home of Sir Henry de Cobham who lived there in 1360 to 1400. The house would have been similar to Ightham Mote but without a moat. The excavations show that it was a substantial timber-framed hall house with a stone built end. It had a garderobe and a separate kitchen making it a high status building. It had outbuildings and three fishponds. It was demolished in 1500 and the building materials re-used in the nearby Cobham Hall, now a girls' school.
More details of what was found in the park can be seen at the Kent County Council website.
One of the '100 Walks in Kent' Book starts in the country park, before heading towards Owletts (a National Trust House), Cobham and Cobham Hall and then returning to the park.

Revenge is the fifth studio album by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 29 June 1986 by RCA Records in the United Kingdom and on 14 July in the United States. Following on from their previous album, Be Yourself Tonight, Revenge continued further in this direction as the duo embraced a more "rock band" style. The album spawned four singles and was a commercial success. The fourth and final single, "Missionary Man", won the 1987 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Its release was supported by an extensive world tour. A 1987 concert from the Australian leg of the tour was also released on home video as Eurythmics Live.
On 14 November 2005, Sony BMG released remastered versions of each of Eurythmics' eight studio albums, containing bonus tracks and remixes. The bonus track "Revenge 2" is a radically different remake of "Revenge", the closing track of the duo's 1981 debut album In the Garden. A line from the song ("She said revenge can be so sweet") is also heard at the end of "A Little of You".

Serbia–Zimbabwe relations are bilateral ties between Serbia and Zimbabwe. Yugoslavia (and now Serbia as one of its successor states) was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which Zimbabwe is also a part.
Relations during Yugoslavia era
The conference center built in 1985 for the 1986 Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Zimbabwe was built by Serbian company Energoprojekt holding, as was Mugabe's personal home. Robert Mugabe met Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito in Brijuni, Yugoslavia, and again in Havana, Cuba in 1979. When Tito died in 1980, Mugabe and a state delegation attended his funeral. Mugabe described Yugoslavia as the nation other non-aligned countries, especially African nations, went to for economic and technological needs.
Relations post Yugoslavia
In 2014, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe expressed his desire to rebuild and continue the friendship between Serbia and Zimbabwe, and described Serbia as the "only country in the world that [Zimbabwe] can consider a perfect friend," and that Serbia is Zimbabwe's only foreign ally. Mugabe also invited Serbian minister Ivan Mrkić to Zimbabwe to begin talks on joint projects in the fields of infrastructure, agriculture, information technology and mining.

The Vacaville tree pruners' strike of 1932 was a two-month strike beginning on November 14 by the CAWIU in Vacaville, California, United States. The strikers were protesting a cut in tree pruning wages from $1.40 for an eight-hour workday to $1.25 for a nine-hour workday. The strike was characterized by multiple incidences of violence, including a break-in at the Vacaville jail that resulted in the kidnapping and abuse of six arrested strike leaders. The strikers were ultimately unsuccessful in demanding higher wages and fewer hours and the CAWIU voted to end the strike on January 20, 1933.
Background
The Cannery and Agricultural Workers' International Union (CAWIU), formerly known as the Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union (AWIU), was a Communist-aligned union active in California in the early 1930s. Early in its career the CAWIU involved itself primarily in spontaneous agricultural strikes, including the Santa Clara Valley cannery workers strike in July 1931 and the California pea pickers strike in May 1932. However, the union focused little on recruiting and organizing a large group of permanent members. Following the failures of these two strikes the CAWIU leaders realized the difficulty of establishing a solid agricultural labor movement around spontaneous and unplanned uprisings.
The CAWIU became more effective in its operating and organizing due to the leadership of Sam Darcy. Darcy became the organizer for District 13 (which included California, Nevada, and Arizona) of the Communist Party USA in 1931. At the time District 13 had a membership of less than 300 and a treasury of $6. Darcy's main focus was organizing California's unemployed and agricultural workers. He immediately began recruiting and training organizers from the working class because he believed they would relate to, and thus more easily recruit, the California farmworkers. Darcy felt that the only hope of success for the Communist party in District 13 was to disregard its own political interests in favor of improving the wages and working conditions of the workers.
Inspired by Darcy's leadership the CAWIU called a conference of all its members on July 18, 1932, with the purpose of establishing a basis for strong organization. The CAWIU resolved to maintain its headquarters in San Jose as a concentration point from which the union would expand. Second, conference delegates agreed that the union's leadership must be reflective of its membership in terms of race, sex, and age. Third, they agreed that all union activities were to enforce demands regarding wages, working conditions, and union recognition, and that careful organization was necessary for any union action. To ensure that every farmworker could afford membership the delegates established the lowest possible initiation fees and monthly dues. Employed workers paid an initiation fee of 50 cents and unemployed workers paid only 10 cents, while monthly dues were 30 cents for working members and 5 cents for the unemployed.
During the months following the San Jose conference CAWIU organizers were greatly active in the three-valley region of Santa Clara, Salinas, and Pajaro, which they selected at the conference for special attention. However, this did not mean that other areas were neglected. For several months a group of CAWIU organizers from Sacramento had been actively recruiting farmworkers in Vacaville. When orchardists cut their tree pruners' wages on November 14, 1932, the CAWIU had gained ample influence among local farmworkers to call the first prearranged strike in its history.
Timeline
Farm owners cut wages
On November 10 Frank H. Buck announced that the wage for tree pruning would be cut to $1.25 for a nine-hour workday beginning November 14. Buck was Vacaville's largest grower who, just a few days prior on November 8, had been elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives, receiving support from nearly every voting farmworker in his district. This was due to the fact that, prior to his election, Buck publicly announced his intention to pay tree pruners $1.40 for an eight-hour workday while other local orchardists were paying $1.25.
The strike begins
The strike began on November 14, the day Buck's reduced wage rate went into effect, when 400 Spanish, Japanese, Filipino, and white tree pruners walked off their jobs. 250 of the workers were CAWIU members and the others were quickly joining. The union issued its strike demands that same day: a wage of $1.50 for an eight-hour workday, a guarantee of no discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or union activity, and formal recognition of the CAWIU by farm employers. In response, the affected employers offered $1.20 for an eight-hour workday. Unwilling to accept this offer, yet lacking essential resources to sustain the strike, the CAWIU looked to outside help. The Workers' International Relief pledged its full support within a few days and the International Labor Defense offered its services to those workers arrested during the strike.
The first confrontation
The first confrontation of the strike occurred on November 21 when strikers barricaded the main street of Vacaville. Their goal was to prevent trucks carrying strikebreakers from reaching the affected orchards on the outskirts of town. Vacaville police chief O. E. Alley attempted to remove a barricade of boxes and the strikers tried to stop him, thus sparking a confrontation. Police, who were greatly outnumbered, attempted to arrest six strike leaders but eventually released them after being surrounded by a large mob of picketers. No one was hurt in the incident.
Riot on November 25
More than a dozen individuals, including five Vacaville police officers, were injured during a riot between strikers and strikebreakers on November 25. The officers and strikebreakers were attacked, after removing street barricades, while attempting to move their truck through the crowd of strikers. One of the strikers, identified as John Lopez, attacked one of the strikebreakers, identified as Arthur Boom, with pruning shears. Boom leaped from the truck and attacked Lopez, starting a riot between about 300 strikers, strikebreakers, and officers. The officers used clubs to attack the strikers while strikers used pruning shears and rocks as weapons. One officer, Deputy Sheriff George Frazier of Fairfield, was knocked unconscious when struck on the head by a rock. Another unidentified officer had his finger tip bitten off.
Library riot on December 4
On December 4 more than 150 strikers met at the home of John Lopez, the first person to attack during the November 25 riot, and marched together to the city library. The crowd of strikers, led by a front line of young women, chanted and carried banners reading "$1.50 and eight hours" and "Free Donald Bingham," a demonstrator arrested at the November 25 riot. The strikers reached the library where they were met by Vacaville police chief O. E. Alley and a large group of Vacaville citizens. Speeches were given by strike supporters such as James Melgar of Vacaville, Robert Nelson of San Jose, and Nora Conklin of Sacramento, all of whom were eventually arrested that day. The crowd grew to nearly 1000 people, most of them Vacaville townsmen and farm owners.
The riot started during a speech by Nora Conklin, an International Defense League worker, who urged the strikers to return to the Lopez home. Banners were ripped from the hands of strikers, sparking a clash between the citizens of Vacaville and the striking workers. Strikers were hit and knocked to the ground, many were injured in the chaos of more than 1000 people, and officers were unable to control the angry crowd. Officers placed twelve individuals under arrest, all of them strikers or speakers, charging them with conducting a meeting without the consent of the city council.
Vacaville jail incident and community response on December 5
The day after the riot at the city library a group of about 30 masked men invaded the Vacaville jail, kidnapped six strike leaders, and drove away with them in seven waiting automobiles, warning journalists and other townspeople not to follow. They drove fifteen miles from the jail where they shaved the strikers' heads, beat them, and covered them with red paint. The kidnappers then turned the strike leaders loose, warned them not to return to Vacaville, and drove off. Police chief O. E. Alley said those who entered the jail had somehow obtained the necessary keys but gave no explanation as to how. Frank H. Buck publicly condemned the act, urging Vacaville residents to proceed with the strike by lawful means. Sheriff's officers also condemned the act but little was done in effort to identify or arrest the kidnappers.
The International Labor Defense sent telegrams condemning the incident to California's Governor Rolph, the mayor of Vacaville, and Vacaville police chief O. E. Alley. The telegrams, signed by the International Labor Defense's national secretary William L. Patterson, demanded the immediate arrest of all individuals and town officials involved in the incident.
That afternoon it was reported that the Sacramento communists would retaliate in force against Vacaville. The word spread throughout the county and angry citizens from all the towns began to gather in Vacaville to fend off the impending invasion. A large crowd of Solano county citizens gathered in front of the library and listened to speeches by Rev. Arthur F. Fruhling and Judge Bell from Winters. The speeches were on the subject of "the real menace to this community," and reaffirmed the resolve of the citizens of Vacaville to protect their town and families.
The end of the strike and aftermath
After more than 2 months the CAWIU had exhausted its resources and the strikers' determination to continue the strike had weakened. Intimidation by local antilabor forces, farm owners, and townsmen was taking its toll, relief from outside sources was dwindling, and attendance at strike meetings had drastically fallen. When American Federation of Labor officials sided with employers in the dispute union leaders recognized that the strike had reached its end. At a meeting on January 20 CAWIU members voted to end the strike. The strikers were ultimately unsuccessful in achieving their demands. Union leaders recognized that, in order for it to have been successful, the strike should have been called at harvesttime when farm employers would be under immediate pressure to reach a settlement.
Historical significance
The Vacaville tree pruners' strike saw great displays of anti-communist sentiment from the farm owners and townspeople. Employers gained the support of many Vacaville citizens through appeals to anti-communism. Farmers and local businessmen organized a large anti-communist rally on December 2 where a local churchman (Rev. Arthur F. Fruhling) branded the CAWIU as a tool for Communist corruption in California. They also heard a judge from a nearby town (Judge Bell from Winters) suggest lynching as a means of combatting the "red" strikers. This anti-communist sentiment was carried on to the Vacaville jail incident three days later when masked men kidnapped six strike leaders and, among other abuses, covered them with red paint.
City and county authorities supported the employers' efforts to undermine the strikers. The mayor of Vacaville at the time, who was one of the largest orchardists in the area, facilitated the cooperation between employers and public authorities throughout the strike. Yet despite the efforts of local authorities and employers the strikers were successful in keeping strikebreakers out of the affected orchards during the early weeks of the strike. During the later stages, however, mass picket lines were made up of mostly women and children in an effort to protect male strikers from further violence and physical abuse.
For the CAWIU the Vacaville defeat was a setback, but the strike served as a learning experience for successful strike leadership. Under Sam Darcy's leadership a group of new and able organizers had taken over the CAWIU and, by the end of the strike in 1933, the union had gained the attention, respect, and confidence of California farmworkers.

Euvester Simpson (yu-ves-tor; born December 12, 1946) is an American voting rights activist and contributor to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s. A Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) member at the age of 17, she helped blacks learn to read, write, and register to vote in Mississippi during the movement. She was an active member in the movement through its entirety. She was involved in the Winona, Mississippi bus incident.
Biography
Simpson was originally from Itta Bena, Mississippi. Her father sent her to Wisconsin to continue schooling following the murder of Emmett Till. Simpson went to Mississippi and enrolled in Amanda Elzy High School. She became involved in the civil rights movement.
Simpson joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) at the age of 17 in 1963. On June 9, she and a group of SNCC members were on their way home from a literacy workshop in Charleston, South Carolina. In Winona, Mississippi, the group was arrested and jailed for being in a white only area of the bus terminal, although a previous Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ruling had given them the right to be there. That night some members of the group were beaten and sexually assaulted by the officers at the jail. The incident was reported extensively in the press.
Following this incident, Simpson began helping blacks learn to read, write, and register to vote. She was arrested while acting as a poll watcher for elections in Madison County.
Simpson married in 1965 and had five children. She remained active in SNCC through the 1960s. Following the movement, Simpson obtained her bachelor's degree from Millsaps College in 1995.
In 2013, Simpson was presented with an award from the Fannie Lou Hamer Institute at Jackson State University.
Simpson served on the board of the Veterans of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement. She helped organize the 30th anniversary of the Freedom Summer in 1994 and was involved in coordinating its 50th anniversary in 2014. She attends memorials, celebrations, and anniversaries of the Civil Rights Movement, and continues to conduct interviews and discussions surrounding the movement.
Personal
In 2015, Simpson, a grandmother of 12, resides in Jackson, Mississippi.

Buniayu Cave is a tourist destination area known for its caves adventure. Located on an area of approximately 10 hectares, Buniayu is located in the village of Kerta Angsana, Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia.
Name origin
The cave was better known as Cipicung cave because its location is within the area of Cipicung village. It is known as Siluman cave by spelunkers. Since the Perum Perhutani took over the management of this area, on 26 February 1992, the name of the cave was changed to Wana Wisata Buniayu Cave. Buniayu name itself is taken from the Sundanese language which consists of the word "Buni" which means "hidden" and "Ayu" which means "beautiful". Therefore, Buniayu means "hidden beauty".
History
Since 1992, the resort is operated by Perum Perhutani Unit III Jawa Barat (West Java) and Banten. There are two caves in the area, namely Goa Angin (Wind Cave) and Goa Kerek (Kerek Cave). Goa Angin or Wind Cave is used for general interest tourism, while Goa Kerek is used for special interest tourism.

Thomas Hart Benton (5 September 1815 – 10 April 1879) was an American politician.
Born on 5 September 1815 in Williamson County, Tennessee, Thomas Hart Benton was named after his uncle, who served in the Tennessee Senate, and represented Missouri on the United States Senate and House of Representatives. The younger T. H. Benton attended Huntington Academy and Marion College in Missouri. In 1839, Benton moved to Dubuque, Iowa, and found work as a teacher. After ending his teaching career, he became a merchant.
Politically, Benton was affiliated with the Democratic Party. He was elected to the Iowa Senate from District 17, and served as a member of the First Iowa General Assembly from 30 November 1846 to 3 December 1848. He stepped down from the state senate to serve six years as Iowa's first Superintendent of Public Instruction. At the time, that office was held concurrently with the position of secretary of the Iowa Board of Regents.
Later, Benton moved to Council Bluffs. As the American Civil War broke out, Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood granted Benton the military rank of colonel and tasked him with organizing the 29th Iowa Infantry Regiment. Following the Battle of Bayou Fourche, the 29th Iowa, under Benton's command, protected the home of Confederate general Albert Pike. Benton completed this task because both he and Pike were Freemasons. Benton was elevated to the rank of brevet brigadier-general and returned to Iowa after the war ended. Benton contested the 1865 Iowa gubernatorial election as a Democratic candidate opposed to African-American suffrage, and lost to Republican incumbent William M. Stone. After Andrew Johnson assumed the presidency following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Assessor of Internal Revenue was removed from office, and Benton took on the position. Benton died in St. Louis, Missouri, on 10 April 1879.

Owen Wright Webster (March 25, 1929 – April 13, 2018) was a distinguished member of the organic and polymer chemistry communities. His polymerization technique for making block copolymer dispersing agents is used by DuPont to make ink-jet printer inks.
Born in Devils Lake, North Dakota, Webster received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of North Dakota in 1951. He received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Pennsylvania State University in 1955 under the direction of L. H. Sommer, known for his silicon mechanistic work. After graduation, Webster joined the Central Research Department of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company at the Experimental Station, where he spent his entire industrial career. He is a Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at both the University of Alabama and the University of Pennsylvania.
Webster's early research activities at du Pont involved synthesis of cyanocarbons. His seminal discoveries in this area ranged from tetracyanoethylene oxide, which adds to olefins through its carbon-carbon bond; hexacyanobutadiene, with an oxidation potential near that of bromine; pentacyanocyclopentadiene, an acid as strong as perchloric acid; diiminosuccinonitrile, a remarkable adduct of cyanogen and hydrogen cyanide; and diazodicyanoimidazole, which cleaves to a carbene that forms a bromo ylide with bromobenzene. In other organic research he showed that diazonium compounds undergo 2+4 cycloaddition to dienes.
In the latter half of his stay at DuPont he switched to polymer science where he invented Group Transfer Polymerization (GTP), a new way to control chain architecture of acrylic polymers. DuPont uses this technology to make ink for ink-jet printers, a multimillion-dollar business. In addition to GTP he developed a living cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers. These two discoveries sparked a burst in university activity on controlled polymerization still going on today. He reintroduced the concept of condensation polymerization of A2B type monomers and named them hyperbranched polymers. These systems augment the now popular dendritic polymers. Shortly before retirement he capped his efforts in the materials science area with the synthesis of high surface-area hypercrosslinked polymers by coupling rigid-rod A2 monomers with B3 crosslinkers.
His polymer work led the prestigious American Chemical Society award for Applied Polymer Science in 1993. After a brief period as research supervisor in the 1980s, he accepted a position as duPont Fellow. Shortly before retirement duPont honored him with its highest technical award, the Lavoisier Medal.

Saint Sister is an Irish traditional duo, whose music has been described as "atmosfolk."
Career
Morgan MacIntyre (from Belfast) and Gemma Doherty (from Derry) met at Trinity College, Dublin. They founded Saint Sister in 2014. They were voted the “Best Irish Act" by the readers of The Irish Times in 2016. Their debut album, Shape of Silence, was released in 2018 and was nominated for the Choice Music Prize. They performed an a cappella rendition of the song "Dreams" by The Cranberries at Lyra McKee's funeral in Belfast, who was killed by the New IRA in April 2019.
In 2020, the duo were part of an Irish collective of female singers and musicians called Irish Women in Harmony, that recorded a version of the song "Dreams" in aid of the charity Safe Ireland, which deals with domestic abuse which had reportedly risen significantly during the Covid-19 lockdown.

Holothuria hilla is a species of sea cucumber in the subgenus Mertensiothuria of the genus Holothuria. Some common names include the contractile sea cucumber, the sand sifting sea cucumber and the tigertail sea cucumber, and in Hawaii it is known as the light spotted sea cucumber. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region and the Red Sea.
Description
Holothuria hilla is a cylindrical sea cucumber, tapering slightly at the posterior end. It can grow to a length of about and a diameter of . The integument is thin, soft and wrinkled. The dorsal surface is covered with longitudinal rows of tube feet modified into thorn-like conical papillae with broad bases, sometimes joined in pairs. These are creamy-white, in contrast to the pinkish, golden or brown background colour of the skin. The ventral surface is similar in colour but the papillae are ranged in four or five rows and are longer and yellowish. The mouth is on the underside and is surrounded by a ring of twenty, yellowish peltate tentacles. This species has Cuvierian tubules but does not expel them defensively as do some other species.
Distribution and habitat
This species is found in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the tropical west and central Indo-Pacific oceans, as far east as Hawaii, and even Panama. It is mainly found at less than , but occasionally as deep as , on sandy, rocky and coral substrates, in lagoons, seagrass meadows and flat areas.
Ecology
Holothuria hilla is a detritivore, raking sand into its mouth with its oral tentacles, extracting and digesting the bacteria, animal and vegetal particles, and voiding the sand through its anus. In this way it churns up significant areas of the seabed.
Reproduction is either sexual, when the male and female liberate their gametes into the water column, or asexual, by fission. Sexual reproduction mostly occurs at hotter times of year and asexual reproduction when it is cooler. In Réunion, where the species is rare, fission is the only breeding method that has been observed. The animal stops feeding and conceals itself while splitting; the missing parts regenerate and are often paler in colour than the original parts.

Since her debut single in 2016, Birla has reached more than 350 million combined streams and collaborated with artists including Sean Kingston, Afrojack, and Mood Melodies. Birla is the first Indian artist with an English language single to go platinum in India; five of her singles have achieved platinum or double platinum status.
In 2020, she became the first Indian to sign with Maverick Management in Los Angeles and released “Let There Be Love” and “Everybody's Lost” becoming the first Indian artiste to be featured on American national top 40 pop radio show, Sirius XM Hits.
Birla is the founder of Svatantra Microfin, a company that provides microfinance to women in rural India. She is also the founder of Ikai Asai and cofounder of Mpower. Birla has received awards for her work and entrepreneurship, including the ET Panache Trendsetters of 2016 award for Young Business Person and was listed as one of GQs Most Influential Indians of 2018.
In 2020, she launched the Ananya Birla Foundation to support: mental health, equality, education, financial inclusion, climate change and humanitarian relief efforts.
She is the daughter of Kumar Mangalam Birla, an Indian industrialist and the chairman of the Aditya Birla Group and sister to Indian cricketer Aryaman Birla (see Birla family)
Early life
Ananyashree Birla developed an interest in music at an early age, learning to play the santoor at the age of eleven. She studied economics and management at the University of Oxford for her bachelor's degree, but dropped out without completing her degree.
Career
Music career
While at university, Birla started singing and playing the guitar at pubs and clubs. She also began writing her own music. Her debut single, "Livin' the Life", was co-written, and produced, by JimBeanz (who previously collaborated with Nelly Furtado, Cheryl Tweedy and Demi Lovato) and was recorded and produced at a studio in Philadelphia. A remix by Dutch DJ Afrojack of "Livin' the Life" makes Birla the first Indian artiste to get a worldwide release through PM:AM Recordings and hit over 14 million views on YouTube as of June 2017. Her songs have been topping the music charts in 2019.
She released her next single "Meant to be" in July 2017 which was subsequently certified Platinum as per the Indian Music Industry (IMI) recognised criteria for certifications. This makes Birla the first Indian artiste with an English single to go platinum. In January 2017, she supported Coldplay at the Global Citizen Festival.
She released her single "Hold On" on 1 March 2018. On 7 June 2018, she released her fourth single "Circles". On 17 January 2019, she released her 5th single and 1st song of 2019 "Better", which was viewed 4 million times on YouTube within 2 days of its release.
She released her debut EP Fingerprint in May 2019, via UMG and Island Records UK. It included "Blackout" featuring Vector and Wurld, which was one of the first collaborations between major artists from India and Nigeria.
In September 2019, she released ‘Day Goes By' with Sean Kingston, who she met when they toured in India together. The song marked one of the first major pop collaborations between a US and Indian artist. The video has been viewed over 10 million times on YouTube.
In 2020 she signed with Maverick Management in Los Angeles. Later that year, she released “Let There Be Love” and “Everybody's Lost” becoming the first Indian artiste to be featured on an American national top 40 pop radio show, Sirius XM Hits.
She has performed at some of the biggest music events in Asia including Global Citizen, Oktoberfest, and Sunburn, Asia's biggest electronic music festival, and has toured with Wiz Khalifa.
Recently she released a cheering song titled, "Hindustani Way", for the Indian Olympic team with A.R. Rahman.
Business career
Birla founded Svatantra Microfin Private Limited at the age of 17. The organisation makes small loans to women entrepreneurs based in rural India. Under her leadership, Svatantra won the Gold Award for Best Start-Up (Skoch Financial Inclusion and Deepening Awards, 2014), Spirituality @ Work: Sach Bharat Samman (Sach Bharat Confluence 2015) and has maintained a quality loan portfolio, offering one of the lowest interest rates in the country.
In 2016, Birla became the founder and CEO of Ikai Asai, an inventory-based global luxury e-Commerce platform. The same year, Forbes named her one of Asia's Women to Watch.
Campaign work
While in England, Birla became aware of a student helpline that helped young people suffering from anxiety and depression. After university, she returned to India and, along with her mother, set up a mental health initiative called MPower aiming to stamp out the stigma towards people with mental illness across India. MPower is also responsible for opening a treatment centre for children suffering from mental health conditions.
In 2020, in response the COVID-19 pandemic, Mpower tied up with the Government of Maharashtra and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to launch a 24x7 free helpline. 45 thousand people had called within 2 months of the launch.
She is an ambassador for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the United States' largest grassroots mental health organisation dedicated to building better lives for the millions of Americans affected by mental illness.
She launched the Ananya Birla Foundation in 2020 with a COVID-19 relief project that involved providing menstruation kits, PPE kits and protective equipment to women and hospitals across Maharashtra. The Foundation also worked in providing essentials to migrant workers during the pandemic.
Personal life
Ananya Birla is the eldest child of the sixth richest Indian – Kumar Mangalam Birla (Chairman of Aditya Birla Group) and Neerja Birla and the sixth generation scion of the Birla family. Birla family's place of origin is Pilani, Rajasthan.

Gary Murphy (born 15 October 1972) is an Irish professional golfer.
Career
Murphy was born in Kilkenny and began playing golf aged 11, after caddying for his father, Jim, who has played an instrumental role in the development of young golfers. He won the Irish Amateur Close Championship in 1992. He turned professional in 1995. He won the Asian Tour qualifying school in 1997, and played two seasons on that tour. In addition, he competed on the second tier European Challenge Tour, before returning to Europe full-time, after winning a European Tour card at the 1999 final qualifying school.
Murphy was unable to secure his place on the European Tour in his rookie season and dropped back down to the Challenge Tour in 2001 and 2002. He regained his European Tour card at the end of 2002 at final qualifying school. Since then, he has been able to win enough money each season to retain his playing status through his position on the Order of Merit.

KEZT-CD (channel 23) is a low-power, Class A television station in Sacramento, California, United States. It is a translator of Modesto-licensed Univision outlet KUVS-DT (channel 19) which is owned and operated by TelevisaUnivision. KEZT-CD's transmitter is located on 22nd Street in downtown Sacramento. Its parent station shares studios with Stockton-licensed duopoly partner and UniMás owned-and-operated station KTFK-DT (channel 64) on Arden Way near Cal Expo in Sacramento.
History
KEZT first aired programming from The Box in the 1990s and 2000, later affiliating with MTV2 in 2001 after The Box ceased operations. The station switched to Spanish-language programming briefly in 2002 as a charter affiliate of the newly-launched Telefutura (now UniMás). When KTFK-TV (channel 64) was acquired by Univision Communications (now TelevisaUnivision) in 2003, it assumed the Telefutura affiliation in 2004 and channel 23 switched back to English-language programming as an affiliate of HSN. This made KEZT one of two television stations owned by Univision at the time to broadcast in English (along with KUVI-TV, the UPN affiliate at the time in Bakersfield, California); however, it re-aired a Spanish-language newscast and two Spanish-language public affairs programs from KUVS on Sunday mornings to meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements regarding local programming on Class A television stations.
In 2014, the HSN affiliation was dropped and KEZT began repeating KUVS-DT (KUVI-DT, at the time, a MyNetworkTV affiliate, became Univision's sole remaining English-language station once again). To accommodate these changes, the station added three new subchannels, expanding from one SD channel to four channels (with two HD channels in 5.1 surround sound for Spanish programming and two SD channels for English programming).
Technical information
Subchannels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
Analog-to-digital conversion
Since it was a Class A low-power analog station, it stayed on the air well after the June 2009 cutoff, but left the air on January 26, 2012. It was replaced with a digital channel (in standard definition with 2-channel sound) the same day.

Manny Pacquiao vs. Marco Antonio Barrera II, billed as Will to Win'', was a super featherweight boxing match. The bout took place on October 6, 2007, at the Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States and was distributed by HBO PPV. The fight was announced after Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions settled their lawsuit over the promotional rights for Pacquiao fights on June 29, 2007.
Barrera came out smarter in this fight as he survived up to the final round but Pacquiao easily outboxed him throughout the fight. Pacquiao defeated Barrera via unanimous decision. Two judges scored the bout 118–109, whereas the third scored it 115–112.
Barrera briefly retired after the fight and returned over a year later in November 2008 to face Sammy Ventura.

Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src, also known as proto-oncogene c-Src, or simply c-Src (cellular Src; pronounced "sarc", as it is short for sarcoma), is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein that in humans is encoded by the SRC gene. It belongs to a family of Src family kinases and is similar to the v-Src (viral Src) gene of Rous sarcoma virus. It includes an SH2 domain, an SH3 domain and a tyrosine kinase domain. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.
c-Src phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues in other tyrosine kinases. It plays a role in the regulation of embryonic development and cell growth. An elevated level of activity of c-Src is suggested to be linked to cancer progression by promoting other signals. Mutations in c-Src could be involved in the malignant progression of colon cancer. c-Src should not be confused with CSK (C-terminal Src kinase), an enzyme that phosphorylates c-Src at its C-terminus and provides negative regulation of Src's enzymatic activity.
c-Src was originally discovered by American scientists J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus, for which they were awarded the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Discovery
In 1979, J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus discovered that normal chickens possess a gene that is structurally closely related to v-Src. The normal cellular gene was called c-src (cellular-src). This discovery changed the current thinking about cancer from a model wherein cancer is caused by a foreign substance (a viral gene) to one where a gene that is normally present in the cell can cause cancer. It is believed that at one point an ancestral virus mistakenly incorporated the c-Src gene of its cellular host. Eventually this normal gene mutated into an abnormally functioning oncogene within the Rous sarcoma virus. Once the oncogene is transfected back into a chicken, it can lead to cancer.
Structure
There are 9 members part of the Src family kinases: c-Src, Yes, Fyn, Fgr, Yrk, Lyn, Blk, Hck, and Lck. The expression of these Src family members are not the same throughout all tissues and cell types. Src, Fyn and Yes are expressed ubiquitously in all cell types while the others are generally found in hematopoietic cells.
c-Src is made up of 6 functional regions: Src homology 4 domain (SH4 domain), unique region, SH3 domain, SH2 domain, catalytic domain and short regulatory tail. When Src is inactive, the phosphorylated tyrosine group at the 527 position interacts with the SH2 domain which helps the SH3 domain interact with the flexible linker domain and thereby keeps the inactive unit tightly bound. The activation of c-Src causes the dephosphorylation of the tyrosine 527. This induces long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics, causing the structure to be destabilized, resulting in the opening up of the SH3, SH2 and kinase domains and the autophosphorylation of the residue tyrosine 416.
The autophosphorylation of Y416 as well as phosphorylation of selected Src substrates is enhanced through dimerization of c-Src. The dimerization of c-Src is mediated by the interaction of the myristoylated N-terminal region of one partner and the kinase domain of another partner. Both the N-terminally attached myristic acid and the peptide sequences of the unique region are involved in the interaction. Given the versatility inherent in this intrinsically disordered region, its multisite phosphorylations, and its divergence within the family, the unique domain likely functions as a central signaling hub overseeing much of the enzymatic activities and unique functions of Src family kinases.
c-Src can be activated by many transmembrane proteins that include: adhesion receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors and cytokine receptors. Most studies have looked at the receptor tyrosine kinases and examples of these are platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) pathway and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
Src contains at least three flexible protein domains, which, in conjunction with myristoylation, can mediate attachment to membranes and determine subcellular localization.
Function
This proto-oncogene may play a role in the regulation of embryonic development and cell growth.
When src is activated, it promotes survival, angiogenesis, proliferation and invasion pathways. It also regulates angiogenic factors and vascular permeability after focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity after intracerebral hemorrhage.
Role in cancer
The activation of the c-Src pathway has been observed in about 50% of tumors from colon, liver, lung, breast and the pancreas. Since the activation of c-Src leads to the promotion of survival, angiogenesis, proliferation and invasion pathways, the aberrant growth of tumors in cancers is observed. A common mechanism is that there are genetic mutations that result in the increased activity or the overexpression of the c-Src leading to the constant activation of the c-Src.
Colon cancer
The activity of c-Src has been best characterized in colon cancer. Researchers have shown that Src expression is 5 to 8-fold higher in premalignant polyps than normal mucosa. The elevated c-Src levels have also been shown to have a correlation with advanced stages of the tumor, size of tumor, and metastatic potential of tumors.
Breast cancer
EGFR activates c-Src while EGF also increases the activity of c-Src. In addition, overexpression of c-Src increases the response of EGFR-mediated processes. So both EGFR and c-Src enhance the effects of one another. Elevated expression levels of c-Src were found in human breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues.
Overexpression of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), also known as erbB2, is correlated with a worse prognosis for breast cancer. Thus, c-Src plays a key role in the tumor progression of breast cancers.
Prostate cancer
Members of the Src family kinases Src, Lyn and Fgr are highly expressed in malignant prostate cells compared to normal prostate cells. When the primary prostate cells are treated with KRX-123, which is an inhibitor of Lyn, the cells in vitro were reduced in proliferation, migration and invasive potential. So the use of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is a possible way of reducing the progression of prostate cancers.
As a drug target
Much tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target c-Src tyrosine kinase (as well as related tyrosine kinases) have been developed for therapeutic use. One notable example is dasatinib which has been approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (PH+) acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Dasatinib is also in clinical trials for the use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer and prostate cancer. Other tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs that are in clinical trials include bosutinib, bafetinib, AZD-0530, XLl-999, KX01 and XL228. HSP90 inhibitor NVP-BEP800 has been described to affect stability of Src tyrosine kinase and growth of T-cell and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias.

The Medici villas are a series of rural building complexes in Tuscany which were owned by members of the Medici family between the 15th century and the 17th century. The villas served several functions: they were the country palaces of the Medici, scattered over the territory that they ruled, demonstrating their power and wealth. They were also recreational resorts for the leisure and pleasure of their owners; and, more prosaically, they were the centre of agricultural activities on the surrounding estates. In 2013, the Medici villas were added to UNESCO's World Heritage list.
History
The first Medici villas were the Villa del Trebbio and that at Cafaggiolo, both strong fortified houses built in the 14th century in the Mugello region, the original home of the Medici family. In the 15th century, Cosimo de' Medici built villas designed by Michelozzo at Careggi and Fiesole, still quite severe buildings, but with additional recreational spaces: courtyards, balconies, and gardens. Lorenzo de' Medici spent long periods at the Villa di Careggi. Gradually, Florence became surrounded by a collection of Medici villas, with others in more distant parts of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. By the end of the 16th century, there were at least 16 major estates, with at least another 11 of secondary interest (mainly agricultural or owned by the Medici family for a short time), together with a constellation of farms and hunting lodges throughout Tuscany. Giusto Utens painted a series of lunettes depicting the main Medici villas in the 17th century, which are now held by the Villa La Petraia.
The last Medici villas were the Villa di Montevettolini and the Villa di Artimino, bought in 1595/6 by Ferdinando I while he was expanding the Villa di Castello, Villa La Petraia and Villa dell'Ambrogiana.
The later villas are outstanding examples of Renaissance and Baroque architecture, and were often accompanied by gardens. The garden at the Villa di Castello, created for Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, was the first in Italy by Niccolò Tribolo, who later designed the Boboli Gardens for Cosimo's Florentine new residence, the Palazzo Pitti.
Each significant member of the Medici family owned an estate. The Duke moved from house to house. When he was in residence, the villa became a microcosm of the Medici court. For hunting, he could visit the Villa del Trebbio, Villa di Cafaggiolo or Villa di Pratolino; reside at the Villa dell'Ambrogiana in the spring; and move to the Villa di Artimino, to while away the summer in its cooler elevated position.
After the death of Gian Gastone de' Medici in 1737, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Medici's assets, including their villas, were acquired by Francis, Duke of Lorraine (later Holy Roman Emperor). Francis only visited Tuscany once in 1739 and for the next twenty six years the villas were neglected. Consequently when Leopold I inherited the duchy in 1765 many were in a poor state and were disposed of. The remainder continued in use by the Lorraines until 1860 when Tuscany was absorbed into the new Kingdom of Italy. The House of Savoy opted to sell all but two of the remaining Medici villas (La Petraia & Poggio a Caiano), which remained in their possession until the end of the monarchy in 1946. Today, some of the Medici villas are museums; others are occupied by institutions, and a few are owned privately, and often hired privately or used to stage public events.
In 2006, the Italian government submitted the Medici villas for designation by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. At the 37th UNESCO World Heritage Committee in 2013 at Phnom Penh, "Medici Villas and Gardens in Tuscany" was added to the World Heritage list.

Gymkhana is a type of motorsport, known as Motorkhana in Australia and New Zealand and as Autotesting in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Similar to autocross, the goal of gymkhana is to achieve the fastest time possible; memorizing the course is a significant part of achieving a fast time. The name is loaned from the equestrian discipline of gymkhana.
Gymkhana events are time and/or speed events in an automobile. These can feature obstacles such as cones, tires, and barrels. The driver must manoeuver through a predetermined "track" performing many different driving techniques. What separates gymkhana from traditional autocross events is that the gymkhana requires drivers to perform reversals, 180 degree spins, 360 degree spins, parking boxes, figure 8s, and other advanced skills. Drifting is also encouraged where helpful or necessary. Essentially, a gymkhana is any event featuring a starting point, a finish line and some sort of "obstacle" to get through, around, or by, all within a certain time limit.
Drivers
The driver's goal is to get through the course as quickly as possible with the fewest mistakes. Acceleration, braking, drifting, and grip driving are all necessary. Not only does the driver have to hold control over the car, but gymkhana requires strong mental concentration and memorization.
History
Gymkhana was started using the horse, long before the car was invented. Racers had to pick up small flags to win in the Genghis Khan's races. Native Americans raced on harsh courses to show their bravery. Those who were eligible for these events were limited. Gymkhana became friendly and festive events.
Courses
Gymkhana courses typically involve only the use of first and second gear, where autotesting in the UK and Ireland add the use of reverse gear. A gymkhana course will typically be from 0:45 to 1:30 in length. Like autocross and autotesting, gymkhana courses are laid out with cones representing "obstacles" to navigate through. Unlike autocross, which can be considered to be a small version of a road course, obstacles in gymkhana will often consist of slaloms, 180 degree turns, 360 degree turns, figure eight turns and sometimes parking boxes. Gymkhana requires strong mental concentration and memorization of the track, as sections of the course frequently must be repeated or navigated backwards and or differently. The driver will use many techniques to effectively navigate a course. Handbrake technique, drifting and sliding and Left-foot braking are all necessary skills for gymkhana.
Competition format
As the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF) is a subsidiary of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), FIA classing is used for Gymkhana in Japan. Gymkhana courses may be used for an entire year, unlike autocross and autotesting where drivers are presented with a new course for each event. Gymkhana participants are allowed two runs of the course, with the fastest time being used to determine the winner of a class. Time penalties are issued for hitting cones, and a failure to navigate the course correctly results in no time score.
National structure
Gymkhana in Japan has a well-defined competition structure, with everything from local to national competitions. Drivers can compete in official events locally in order to qualify for regional events and so on. Japan has an Japan Gymkhana competition each year. Despite being governed under the FIA in Japan, there is no official international gymkhana competition at this time. Drivers in official events may be required to hold a JAF-issued competition license.

In chemistry, a transition metal boryl complex is a molecular species with a formally anionic boron center coordinated to a transition metal. They have the formula LnM-BR2 or LnM-(BR2LB) (L = ligand, R = H, organic substituent, LB = Lewis base). One example is (C5Me5)Mn(CO)2(BH2PMe3) (Me = methyl). Such compounds, especially those derived from catecholborane and the related pinacolborane, are intermediates in transition metal-catalyzed borylation reactions.
Synthesis
Oxidative addition is the main route to metal boryl complexes. Both B-H and B-B bonds add to low-valent metal complexes. For example, catecholborane oxidatively adds to Pt(0) to give the boryl hydride.
C6H4O2BH + Pt(PR3)2 → C6H4O2B Pt(PR3)2H
Addition of diboron tetrafluoride to Vaska's complex gives the triboryl iridium(III) derivative:
2B2F4 + IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 → Ir(BF2)3(CO)(PPh3)2 + ClBF2

County courthouse
William Buell granted the land for construction of the Courthouse. It is set atop a hill rising from the Saint Lawrence River. A broad boulevard extends to the main street. The Brockville Courthouse, one of the oldest in Ontario, was erected in 1842. The original plan had been to build a courthouse in the township of Johnstown but the land there was too swampy for construction. Instead, the Courthouse was built in the township of Elizabethtown.
The figure of Justice, a blind-folded woman holding the scales of justice, was carved by master carpenter William Holmes in 1844. This statue was named "Sally Grant" by Paul Glasford, the chair of the building committee, in honour of the woman who posed as the model. It was erected in 1845. However, the statue was damaged by Hurricane Hazel and by 1956, the statue was rotting. The original statue is on display at the Westport museum. A replica carved by Robert Kerr of Smiths Falls was placed atop the Courthouse in 1982.

Drunkorexia is a colloquialism for anorexia or bulimia combined with an alcohol use disorder. The term is generally used to denote the utilization of extreme weight control methods to compensate for planned binge drinking.
Research on the combination of an eating disorder and binge drinking has primarily focused on college-aged women, though the phenomenon has also been noted among young men. Studies suggest that individuals engage in this combination of self-imposed malnutrition and binge drinking to avoid weight gain from alcohol, to save money from purchasing alcohol, and to facilitate alcohol intoxication.
Link between binge drinking and eating disorders
Studies reveal that individuals experiencing an eating disorder are at a higher risk of developing substance use disorders. It is reported that up to half of individuals with eating disorders misuse alcohol or illicit substances, with anorexia and bulimia being the disorders most commonly linked to substance use.
The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders reports that 72% of women who admit to inappropriate alcohol use also classify as suffering from an eating disorder.
Symptoms
Drunkorexia consists of three major aspects: alcohol use/misuse, food intake restriction, and excessive physical activity. It is commonly summarized in the following activities:
Counting daily calorie intake (commonly known as "calorie counting") to ensure no weight is gained when consuming alcohol.
Missing or skipping meals to conserve calories to consume alcoholic beverages.
Over-exercising to compensate calories consumed from alcoholic beverages.
Consuming an extreme amount of alcohol to vomit previously ingested food.
Treatment
Drunkorexia is not a medically diagnosed disorder; therefore, there is no specific treatment. However, as drunkorexia is a combination of two different disorders, binge drinking and eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, the treatment needs to address both.
Effects
The combination of self-starvation and excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to an array of physical and psychological consequences. Drinking in a state of malnutrition can predispose individuals to a higher rate of blackouts, alcohol poisoning, alcohol-related injury, violence, or illness. Drinking on an empty stomach allows ethanol to reach the blood system faster and raises one's blood alcohol content at a dangerous speed, which can render the drinker more vulnerable to alcohol-related brain damage. In addition, excessive alcohol consumption can have a detrimental impact on hydration and mineral and nutrient retention, which exacerbates the consequences of malnutrition and compromises an individual's cognitive faculties. These effects are more pronounced in women, as women usually metabolize alcohol slower than men.
At risk populations
Drunkorexia is found to be most common among university students, as they are faced with the conflicting pressure of heavy drinking and maintaining a slim physique. First-year college students are said to be especially predisposed to eating disorders as an attempt to avoid the fabled "Freshman 15", defined as the weight gain that results from adjusting to a college lifestyle.
.
The National Eating Disorder Association disclosed that approximately 20% of college students of both sexes admitted to suffering from an eating disorder at some point in their life. In addition, a 2002 study reported 70%, of participating college students, reported consumed alcohol within the prior month and 40% had engaged in binge drinking.
A 2013 survey observed 107 female university students in order to study the frequency and correlation of self-induced vomiting after consuming alcohol. Results showed that 59.8% of the participants who reported drinking alcohol also appeared to have engaged in self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption. Participants that reported self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption also reported more bulimia nervosa symptomatology.
In Australia, a 2013 study surveyed 139 Australian women between the ages of 18 and 29 enrolled in an undergraduate degree at university. These women were asked to complete a survey regarding compensatory eating and behaviors in response to alcohol consumption to test for drunkorexia symptomatology. In the sample tested, 79% of participants demonstrated engaging in characterized drunkorexia behavior. Further analysis of the results showed that the social norms of drinking and the social norms associated with body image and thinness impacted heavily upon the motivation for these behaviors.
Other research has shown that a further correlation exists between college students who participate in physical activity and alcohol dependence. Individuals who were more physically active than their peers had a higher tendency to be alcohol dependent or to engage in regular binge drinking.
Excessive exercise is often perceived as a symptom of anorexia nervosa and other associated eating disorders, which further exemplifies the existence of drunkorexia, particularly in college-age individuals.
Another study found that there was little difference between drunkorexia rates among students, non students and former students.
Motivations
The motivations behind drunkorexia as a pattern of behavior is one of the lesser understood aspects of the condition. It is suspected that the predominant factors in the development of drunkorexia are a distorted self-perception congruent with unrealistic standards of body image, peer pressure to assimilate to the norm in terms of social drinking and societal standards of beauty, a coping mechanism against anxiety and depression, and as a means of getting intoxicated rapidly in response to stress and or peer pressure.
Other motivations for drunkorexia include; preventing weight gain, saving money that would be spent on food to buy alcohol, and getting intoxicated faster.
Drunkorexia as a diagnosis
Co-existing, and self-reinforcing starvation and alcohol disorders are gaining recognition in the fields of dual diagnosis, psychiatry, and addictionology.

WEC Le Mans, known as in Japan, is a racing simulation video game released in arcades by Konami in 1986. It was the first racing video game to depict the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Lap of Le Mans is split up into three sections, during which the time of day changes from day to dusk, dusk to night, and night to dawn.
Gameplay
The game attempted to realistically simulate car driving, with the car jumping up and down, turning back and forth, and spinning up to 180 degrees, with an emphasis on acceleration, braking, and gear shifting, along with the need for counter-steering to avoid spin-outs. It also featured accurately simulated courses approved by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, and used force feedback to simulate road vibration in the form of a vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps.
The game is known as being very difficult to complete: the track's width remains constant at three lanes of racing, and any slight contact with an opposing race car will result in either a spin, or a spectacular flip in the air. Going off the course and running wide at a corner will also end in a spin.
Play continues until timer is depleted and/or four successive laps are completed, which ends the game.
Arcade cabinet
Konami released three different video game arcade cabinet versions of the video arcade game, an upright machine, a 'mini' spin where the driver sat in a sit-down cockpit, and the 'big' spin version, the deluxe arcade version that would actually spin the gamer around a 360° spinning base, turning left or right depending on the corner. The front of the 'big' spin arcade machine looked like a real Prototype C Race car.
The arcade cabinet was expensive for its time, with a high price of £7000 in 1986, equivalent to £ or $ in .
Ports
The game had several ports by Imagine Software (as Imagine Studios) to Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum. A rumored 16-bit port to the Amiga and Atari ST was mentioned, but never came to fruition.
Reception
The game was commercially successful in arcades. In Japan, Game Machine listed WEC Le Mans on their January 15, 1987 issue as being the most-successful upright arcade unit of the month. The spin cabinet went on to be the fourth highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game of 1987 in Japan, below Out Run, Super Hang-On and Darius. On the Coinslot dedicated arcade game charts in the United Kingdom, WEC Le Mans was number-three in July 1988, below Street Fighter and Continental Circus.
The arcade version was critically acclaimed upon release. Following its debut at the Preview '87 show in September 1986, Computer and Video Games gave it a positive review in its January 1987 issue, with Clare Edgeley declaring it her favourite game at show, describing it as a "fast and realistic racing simulation" and praising the rotating cockpit cabinet, concluding it to be the most " game" she played in months. She gave it "the edge" over Out Run, mainly for better "movement", but noted "many seem to prefer Out Run". At the ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International) show in January 1987, both Out Run and WEC LE Mans "stole the January show" according to Computer and Video Games. Clare Edgeley reviewed it again in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, stating it "is far and way the most sophisticated and certainly the most thrilling game I've ever played", describing it as "like Hang-On" but "with a racing car which you actually sit inside" and a "movement system" that "is entirely different from anything experienced before" where "you really get thrown around" and "which simulates each action, even spinning" and "shakes the whole car" when going off track or skidding on the marked borderlines. She stated "there are hazards to avoid, other cars bombing past you", "great graphics and high speed". Top Score newsletter called it a "superb driving simulator that was unfortunately overshadowed" by Out Run.
The Spectrum version of the game also earned critical acclaim. The Spectrum version was also commercially successful, reaching 4th place on the UK Spectrum chart in May 1989.
Konami's Tanaka Fumihaki cited WEC Le Mans as the chief inspiration for Konami's 1995 game Speed King.
The Spanish magazine Microhobby valued the game with the following scores: Originality: 30% Graphics: 70% Motion: 80% Sound: 50% Difficulty: 80% Addiction: 80%

Santiago Metro Line 6 is a line on the Santiago Metro, Santiago, Chile. It connects the commune of Cerrillos, in the south west of the city, with Providencia in the east of the city, where most economic activity is concentrated. It has 10 new stations on 15.3 km of track.
The main purposes of Line 6 is to relieve the saturated Line 1 and to provide extra connections across the Santiago transport network. The line connects with Line 1, Line 2, Line 3 and Line 5, with the suburban train network (Metrotrén) at Lo Valledor station, and with the Transantiago bus network at Avenida Pedro Aguirre Cerda, Avenida Departamental, Avenida Santa Rosa and Avenida Grecia. It is also hoped that the line will incentivise development in the south central area of the capital city.
The line directly benefits the communes of Cerrillos, Estación Central, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, Santiago, San Miguel, San Joaquín, Ñuñoa, Providencia and Las Condes.
It was inaugurated on November 2, 2017, by President Michelle Bachelet.
History
The project was announced by Chilean president Michelle Bachelet in 2009. In January 2012 a modification to the original track plan was announced, with the “Maestranza” (renamed as “Lo Valledor”) and “Club Hípico” stations relocated on Avenida Carlos Valdovinos.
However, on December 22, 2017, as a result of the announcement of the construction of the new Line 7, the lengthening of Line 6 from the Los Leones station to the future Isidora Goyenechea station is confirmed, with which both lines will remain connected.
Initial criticisms
Mayors of some of the wealthier communes in the east of the city have criticised the project, claiming that insufficient consultation had taken place before it was announced. Other critics complained about further delays in the construction of Line 3, whose completion date was pushed back in favour of Line 6.
Technical studies carried out by the Catholic University of Chile claimed that Line 6 has several advantages over Line 3, primarily because of its greater social impact and the potential for development it brings to derelict areas of the city.
Innovations
The new metro lines (Line 3 and Line 6) are expected to comply with high security and passenger comfort standards. The new security measures will include cameras inside the trains, an overhead electric transmission line, auto-drive, doors located on the platform, air conditioning in the trains and connections with suburban trains.

Princes Street Gardens are two adjacent public parks in the centre of Edinburgh, Scotland, lying in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle. The Gardens were created in the 1820s following the long draining of the Nor Loch and building of the New Town, beginning in the 1760s.
The loch, situated on the north side of the town, was originally an artificial creation forming part of its medieval defences and made expansion northwards difficult. The water was habitually polluted from sewage draining downhill from the Old Town.
The gardens run along the south side of Princes Street and are divided by The Mound, on which the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy buildings are located. East Princes Street Gardens run from The Mound to Waverley Bridge, and cover . The larger West Princes Street Gardens cover and extend to the adjacent churches of St. John's and St. Cuthbert's, near Lothian Road in the west.
In 1846 the railway was built in the valley to connect the Edinburgh-Glasgow line at Haymarket with the new northern terminus of the North British line from Berwick-upon-Tweed at Waverley Station.
The Gardens are the best known parks in Edinburgh, having the highest awareness and visitor figures for both residents and visitors to the city.
Railway
In 1846, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway company constructed a sunken railway line along the southern edge of the Gardens to join its Haymarket terminus to a new General Station adjoining the North British Railway Company's North Bridge terminus (both stations later renamed Waverley Station). This involved constructing the Haymarket Tunnel (comprising separate north and south tunnels), 910 metres long, between the western end of the gardens and Haymarket Station. A shorter tunnel (again comprising two separate tunnels) was also dug through The Mound which separated the East and West Gardens.
East Princes Street Gardens
History
East Princes Street Gardens originated after a dispute between Edinburgh Corporation (town council) and the early New Town proprietors, among whom was the philosopher David Hume who resided in St. David Street, a side street off Princes Street. In 1771 the council acquired the land as part of the First New Town development. It began feuing ground on the south side of Princes Street (on the site of the current Balmoral Hotel and Waverley Market) for the building of houses and workshops for a coach-builder and a furniture-maker. After a failed petition to the council the proprietors raised two actions in the Court of Session to halt the building and to condemn the Corporation for having contravened their feuing terms by which they had pre-supposed open ground and a vista south of the street. After the Court found in favour of the council on the first point the decision was quickly appealed to the House of Lords and overturned, but when the Court again supported the council on the second point, the matter was submitted to judicial arbitration. This resulted in a judgement that the houses could be completed which later allowed the North British Hotel (Balmoral Hotel) to be built on the site, that the adjacent furniture-maker's premises must not rise above the level of Princes Street (which is the reason the roof of Waverley Market is at street level) and that the ground westwards for half the length of Princes Street "shall be kept and preserved in perpetuity as pleasure-grounds to be dressed up at the expense of the town council as soon as may be."
Monuments
Along the south side of Princes Street are many statues and monuments. In the East Gardens most prominent is the Scott Monument, a Neo-Gothic spire built in 1844 to honour Sir Walter Scott. Within East Princes Street Gardens there are statues of the explorer David Livingstone, the publisher and Lord Provost Adam Black and the essayist Professor John Wilson, who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher North. There is also a small commemorative stone honouring the volunteers from the Lothians and Fife who fought in the Spanish Civil War.
Winter Wonderland
Every year, in the weeks leading up to Christmas, the East Gardens are transformed into 'Winter Wonderland'. This includes a variety of amusement park rides and the Christmas Market, which has food and gifts from all around the world. The most notable attractions are the ice rink and the 33 metre (108 feet) high Ferris wheel, often dubbed 'The Edinburgh Eye'.

West Princes Street Gardens
Early history
West Princes Street Gardens were originally the private property of "the Princes Street Proprietors" who overlooked them from their houses on the western half of the street. This was passed to them from the council in 1816 and the gardens were opened to subscribers generally in the New Town in 1821.
Dogs, cricket, perambulators and smoking were prohibited under their rules, and people using bath-chairs had to present a doctor's certificate to the Committee of the garden attesting to their ailment not being contagious. An application by the Scottish Association for Suppressing Drunkenness that the gardens be opened during Christmas and New Year "with the object of keeping parties out of the dram shops (i.e. illegal drinking premises)" led eventually to them being opened to the general public on Christmas Day, New Year's Day and one other day in the year.
Public park
In 1876, despite much opposition from residents, the town council reacquired the ground for use as a public park. The new park was laid out by the City Architect Robert Morham including the building of a very picturesque gardeners cottage at the east end of the West Gardens. As part of a later agreement (c.1880) the council widened Princes Street (resulting in a far steeper embankment on that side). A series of statues were erected along the edge of the widened road.
Modernization of the gardens is currently under discussion with the launch of The Quaich Project fundraising campaign from the Ross Development Trust. The new design will improve accessibility and provide new pathways and connections across the city.
Shelters
In 1939 four huge air-raid shelters were created within this northern embankment. The distinctive shelters now on the upper walkway date from 1950 and were designed by Alexander Garden Forgie. As with most structures in the gardens they are listed buildings.
Ross Bandstand and Ross Fountain
The Ross Bandstand in the centre of the West Gardens is named after William Henry Ross, Chairman of the Distillers Company Ltd., who gifted the first bandstand on the site in 1877. The present building and terraces date from 1935.
The Princes Street proprietors contributed £500 as a goodwill gesture to the cost of the bandstand. Various concerts and other events are held at the Ross Bandstand including the Festival Fireworks Concert, Men's Health Survival of the Fittest, and during the city's Hogmanay celebrations. The Ross Development Trust proposed to rebuild the bandstand as a Ross Pavilion based on design by architects wHY following an international competition in 2017.
The Ross Fountain is the focus of the western end of the gardens. Gifted by Edinburgh gunsmith Daniel Ross, it was originally installed in 1872 and restored in 2018 with the help of the Ross Development Trust.
Monuments
Along the south side of Princes Street are statues of the poet Allan Ramsay, the church reformer Thomas Guthrie, and the obstetric pioneer James Young Simpson. Other monuments are the Royal Scots Greys Memorial, the Scottish American War Memorial, the Norwegian Brigade War Memorial, and Wojtek the Bear.
The statuary group on the lower path represents The Genius of Architecture crowning the Theory and Practice of Art and is by William Brodie originally for the garden of Rockville, the home of his maverick architect son-in-law Sir James Gowans. It was moved here in the 1960s following the demolition of Rockville.
The Swedish runestone U 1173 was located beneath the Castle walls (), however due to security concerns it was removed from its location in November 2017 and was moved to George Square, outside the school of Scandinavian studies in 2020.
At the eastern entrance to the Gardens there is the world's first floral clock dating from 1903.
Royal Scots Monument
The large curved monument to the Royal Scots stands slightly hidden just south of the gardener's cottage. It was designed by Sir Frank Mears with sculpture by Pilkington Jackson. Described as a "modern henge" it dates from 1950 but was added to and "finalised" in May 2007 following the termination of the Royal Scots in 2006. This added additional Battle Honours gained since the 1950s.
Mortonhall Baby Ashes Memorial
A new monument, in the form of a baby elephant by sculptor Andy Scott, was added to the gardens on 2 February 2019. Located by The Genius of Architecture, this is a permanent reminder of the 250 babies and their families affected by the Mortonhall scandal, which was uncovered in 2012.

Noolaham Foundation is a non-profit, charitable organization founded to provide enhanced access to information sources and foster knowledge-based development in Sri Lanka. It is a registered organization (GA 2390) based in Sri Lanka with volunteer participation from all over the world. Noolaham Foundation was initiated as Project Noolaham in 2005. In 2010, it was formally incorporated in Sri Lanka.
Noolaham Foundation was created with a view to documenting, preserving and disseminating texts and sources that speak about the social, economic, cultural and political discourses related to the Sri Lankan Tamil speaking communities. In the post-independence Sri Lanka, sites of knowledge production and knowledge preservation of the Tamil speaking communities such as the Jaffna Public Library has been lost. Therefore, it is important that we create alternative, virtual platforms where this knowledge could be preserved. Such platforms can also cater to the needs of local and international researchers who are interested in studying the various aspects of the Sri Lankan Tamil speaking communities. Noolaham Foundation is one such platform.

Yeedzin Football Club was a football club from Thimphu, Bhutan. Founded in 2002, they were promoted from the B-Division to the A-Division in the same year. They won their first A-Division title in 2008 and have won a total of four A-Division championships. They also qualified for the National League in 2012 and 2013, winning the inaugural national competition in 2012. They have been Bhutan's representative in the AFC President's Cup on four occasions, and lost all of their twelve games played in the competition with a goal difference of –75.
History
2002–2008
Yeedzin were founded in 2002 by Jigme Norbu and participated in the 2002 B-Division. During the group stage, they won four out of their five matches, losing only to Rigzung Club who finished one point above them. In addition to Druk United and Sharks, who qualified from the other group, they progressed to the semi-finals. They beat Druk United 1–0 but lost 5–3 on penalties after extra time in the final following a 1–1 draw in regular time with Rigzung. However, both finalists were promoted to the A-Division for the following season. Yeedzin's first recorded appearance in competition was in the 2003 season where they finished in sixth place out of ten teams. Few results are recorded for this season and none for Yeedzin, but is known that they either won three, drew one and lost four of their eight games or won two, drew four and lost two. It is not known where they finished in the league the following season, although it is certain that they did not finish in the top four of the 2004 A-Division. However, there was a knockout competition for all the clubs in the A-Division in which Yeedzin were runners-up, losing to Drukpol in the final.
In 2005, Yeedzin achieved their best finish to date, finishing in third place, a point behind the winners Transport United and behind on goal difference to Drukpol, 14 points ahead of fourth-place finishers Druk Star. They topped the table after four of the twelve matches, with three wins and a draw, including a 4–0 victory over Transport United. However, by halfway, they had slipped to second place, two points behind Drukpol, but still ahead of Transport United on goal difference. The league went to the final game of the season, and Yeedzin were beaten to the title, losing 2–1 away to Transport United. They also lost 3–1 on penalties to Drukpol in the A-Division Knock-Out Championship. Details are scant for the next season, it is only known that they did not finish in either first, third or fourth place, beating RIHS in the process 4–1. Slightly more data is available for the 2007 season, Yeedzin finished in fourth place on 23 points, ahead of Royal Bhutan Army, but behind champions Transport United, Drukpol and Druk Star in a season that included a 15–0 victory over RIHS when the opposition fielded only nine players. The following season Yeedzin produced their best performance to date winning both the league and cup. They finished the league season unbeaten, four points ahead of runners-up Transport United, dropping points in only two games, including a 1–1 draw with Choden FC, the Bhutan U-19 team whilst also beating Rigzung 20–0 in the second half of the season. They won the 2008 A-Division Knock-Out Tournament, beating Royal Bhutan Army 4–3 in the final.
2009
However, despite scoring more goals than any other team and more than the bottom half of the table managed combined and with scorelines of 10–2, 20–0 and 16–1 against Rigzung and Druk Athletic twice respectively, they were unable to retain their league title in the 2009 season, losing three games throughout the course of the season and finishing five points behind Druk Star, who ended the season unbeaten. They were equally unfortunate in the Club Cup Championship. Despite beating Nangpa 12–0 in the quarter-finals and Choden 4–1 in the semi-finals, they lost 1–0 to Druk Star in the final as the mirrored what Yeedzin had achieved the previous season.
2009 was also the first season that Yeedzin represented Bhutan in continental competition, their victory in the previous season's league competition meaning that they were awarded Bhutan's berth in the 2009 AFC President's Cup. They were drawn in Group C for the Group Stage, along with Dordoi-Dynamo Naryn of Kyrgyzstan, Kanbawza of Burma and Phnom Penh Crown of Cambodia. They travelled to Bishkek, where all the group games were played, but were beaten in all three games, conceding fourteen goals and scoring only three through Pema Chophel, Jigme Tenzin and Tschedupla, and did not progress.
2010–11
Yeedzin bounced straight back the following season with another unbeaten season, finishing nine points clear of Drukpol to win their second championship, dropping points only once; in a 0–0 draw against Drukpol. In winning the title, they were awarded Bhutan's place in the 2011 AFC President's Cup.
Details for the 2011 season are again minimal, although it is known that Yeedzin continued their domestic success, winning a second consecutive title and third overall, in an abridged season where they A-Division was contested only as a single round-robin set of matches in anticipation of the commencement of a new national league competition that was ultimately cancelled. They also competed in the 2011 AFC President's Cup and were drawn in Group B for the group stage along with Istiqlol from Tajikistan, Yadanarbon from Myanmar and Jabal Al Mukaber from Palestine. They travelled to Yangon in Myanmar, where all the group games were played. In a repeat of their 2009 campaign, they were again beaten in all three games, this time without managing to score a single goal and again, did not progress to the next round.
2012
The next season started off in a disappointing fashion. Despite two heavy defeats of Nangpa (12–0 and 16–0), Yeedzin were beaten twice by Drukpol and drew twice with Zimdra (now known as Thimphu City FC) to finish behind these two sides in third place, with Drukpol taking the A-Division title. However, this was sufficient for qualification to the inaugural Bhutan National League. This new league was a genuine national competition, whereas previously the A-Division had nominally been termed the National League between 2001 and 2003, it was in practice a league for teams based in Thimphu. Yeedzin qualified along with Drukpol and Zimdra and were joined by Phuentsholing, representing Chukha District, Samtse, representing Samtse District and Ugyen Academy, representing Punakha District. A team representing Gelephug District was supposed to enter as well but apparently did not. Yeedzin performed strongly in the competition, finishing the league after ten games unbeaten, whilst conceding only five goals. They won the league by beating Drukpol 2–1, coming from behind following a goal for Drukpol from Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck to claim the 400,000 Ngultrum prize. Although they had lost their A-Division title, with this competition now merely being a qualifier for the new national league, Yeedzin had won their third consecutive national championship, the first time a team had achieved this feat since Transport United in 2006, the only other time in the history of Bhutanese football that this had happened.
In addition to their domestic success, their championship-winning performance in the prior season also meant that they received Bhutan's place in the 2012 AFC President's Cup, the second consecutive time they had competed in the tournament and their third overall appearance. Yeedzin were drawn in Group B for the Group stage along with Dordoi Bishkek of Kyrgyzstan, Nepal Police Club and Phnom Penh Crown from Cambodia. They travelled to Phnom Penh, where all the Group B games were to be played, but again Yeedzin's performance was disappointing, as they lost all three games for the third time and conceded 23 goals, their worst defensive performance to date and did not progress. Unlike the previous year's tournament however, they were able to score two consolation goals through Chencho Gyeltshen and Tshering Wangdi in a 11–2 loss to Dordoi Bishkek.
2013–14
Yeedzin were able to recover their A-Division title in the 2013 season, qualifying for the second National League competition in first place following an unbeaten performance, dropping points only in a 0–0 draw with eventual runners-up Thimphu City, scoring 27 goals in their eight matches, including a 10–2 victory over Druk United. They were also unbeaten in the National League as well, the first time a side had gone through both competitions without losing. Although, with five draws to their name in the national league they were only able to finish in second place behind Ugyen Academy and so missed out on Bhutan's place in the AFC President's Cup for the first time in three years. However, since they had won the previous year's National League competition, they did compete as Bhutan's entrant for the third consecutive year in the 2013 AFC President's Cup.
They were again drawn in Group B for the group stage of matches along with Dordoi Bishkek, for the second year in a row, Global from the Philippines and KRL from Pakistan. They travelled to Cebu City in the Philippines, where all the Group B matches were to be played, but for the fourth time were unable to gain any points, losing all three games and, for the second time in their for appearances, were unable to score a goal and did not progress from the group.
2014 saw the worst performance in the A-Division by Yeedzin in their history. With only three wins and two draws from their twelve matches, they finished in sixth place and failed to qualify for the National League for the first time. In addition, since they lost the National League title to Ugyen Academy the previous season, they did not participate in the final edition of the President's Cup.

Bintou Dembélé is a dancer and a choreographer who is recognized as one of the pioneer figures of Hip hop dance in France. After having danced for more than thirty years in the Hip Hop world, Bintou Dembélé has been the artistic director of her own dance company Rualité since 2002. Her work explores the issue of the memory of the body through the prisms of colonial and post-colonial French history.
Beginnings
Bintou Dembélé was born on 30 March 1975 in the suburbs of Paris to a family who emigrated to France after Sub-Saharan Africa's decolonization. Bintou started dancing with her brothers when she was not even ten years old; her interest in Hip Hop dance was in part influenced by the show H.I.P. H.O.P. on the French TV channel TF1. Around 1985, Bintou Dembélé and her friends Gérard Léal et Anselme Terezo created the dance group Boogie Breakers and started dancing collectively in their neighborhood's public spaces. In 1989, she joined the group Concept of Art, in which was born several collectives of rappers and dancers. While in middle school, Bintou Dembélé also joined the dance groups Aktuel Force (in 1993 and 1997) and Mission Impossible (1994-1996) in which she diversified her Hip Hop dancing by learning House Dance, New Style, Break Dancing... etc. She progressively acquired her dance technique and street credibility through collective trainings. She practiced in emblematic parisian spots for the French street dances as in Châtelet les Halles, the Place du Trocadéro-et-du-11-Novembre, the Place Georges-Pompidou and La Défense. In addition to her participation to different collectif trainings in Paris, she gets involved in street shows, festivals, battles and national scale Hip Hop competitions. She also takes part in different shows in nightclubs in Belgium, at Le Palace (Paris), le Bataclan or Le Divan du Monde.
Professional career
Dembélé's professional career began in 1996 when she was recruited by the Théâtre Contemporain de la Danse de Paris (TCD) as a dancer and choreographer. In 1997, she joined the dance group the Collectif Mouv' where she created her first show entitled Et si…! (What if...!) with the break dancer Rabah Mahfoufi. While dancing for the Collectif Mouv', Dembélé also collaborated with the French Jazz saxophonist Julien Lourau and with the musical organization the Groove Gang to create a show entitled Come fly with us. At the same time she also co-founded the dance group Ykanji and the female group dance Ladyside. Her participation in French popular TV shows such as Graines de stars or Hit Machine enabled Dembélé to meet French rappers and dancers such as MC Solaar and Bambi Cruz. In 1998, she danced for MC Solaar's concert in l'Olympia (Paris) in a show choreographed by Max-Laure Bourjolly and Bambi Cruz. In 2002, as an interpreter for the dance company Käfig, Dembélé performed at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan during the New York New Europe '99 Festivals. The same year, she also created her own dance compagny, named Rualité. In 2004 Dembélé created and performed her third show entitled L'Assise (The Foundation), which recounted the creative journey of individuals who explored the Hip Hop culture in France. In 2010, she created her first solo show entitled Mon appart' en dit long (My apartment tells a lot about it), in which she explored the notion of femininity, spatiality and daughter-mother relationship. In 2011, she choreographed the music video of the song Roméo kiffe Juliette of the French slam singer Grand Corps Malade. In 2013, she created and performed in Z.H. (an abbreviation for 'zoo humains', which means in English human zoos). Z.H, which is one of Dembélé's major creations, was created for six dancers and explored the notions of memory, imperial gaze and voyeurism, racism and the dehumanization of people of color. In 2016, she created and performed in S/T/R/A/T/E/S - Quartet et le duo (S/T/R/A/T/U/M - Duo quartet), a dancing and musical performance for two duos mixing improvisation, dance theater, gimmick and 'corporeal poetry' to interrogate the notions of the transmission of traumatic memory, of feminism and of post-colonial identities. As a recognized dancer with both a street and professional background, Dembélé participates as a judge in various battles and other Hip Hop dance competitions and trains dancers as interprets for live performances all over the world. Bintou and the dancers of her dance compagny Rualité have performed their shows in France and internationally (in Sweden, in Burma, in Chile, in Macedonia, in French Guiana and in Mali).
Commitments
Rualité 's aim is to explore new forms of political engagements and representations by gathering diverse artists and researchers. The photograph and video maker Denis Darzacq and the anthropologist of colonial representations Sylvie Chalaye are one of the personalities linked to Rualité. Organized around the ideas of creation, transmission and research, Rualité not only produces dance shows but also works for enhancing the access to culture and to cultural activities both in the French metropole (and especially in its most marginalized communities) and in its overseas territories (and more especially in French Guiana). In the context of her company, Bintou Dembélé frequently animates pedagogical and/or exploratory workshops aiming to gather people from different backgrounds and orientations in order to produce new insights on what being a committed artist means. Bintou Dembélé's engagements led her to work with students and scholars in schools and universities, with musicians and dancers from different backgrounds as well as with some of the Parisian suburbs' carceral population.
Bintou Dembélé's commitment to the development of the Hip Hop culture and to the recognition and legitimacy of its actors in the French public spaces and common discourse led her to integrate the SeFeA laboratory organized by Université Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris 3 in 2014. In September 2016, she is hosted by the Gender and Women studies department of the University of California, Berkeley in a conference to talk about the video documentary of her performance Z.H.

Terminator X: A Laser Battle for Salvation (often shortened to just Terminator X) is a themed indoor laser skirmish attraction created by Lynton V. Harris of Sudden Impact Entertainment. The attraction is currently located at Sunway Lagoon in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia and at Six Flags México on February 3, 2011.
History
The first Terminator X attraction debuted at the Royal Adelaide Show in Australia in 2009. It was then moved to Adventure World in Perth, Western Australia later that year for the summer season. In early 2010, that particular installation was shipped to the United States. By May 2010, the attraction had opened at both La Ronde in Montreal, Canada, and at Sunway Lagoon in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. In November 2010, Six Flags announced that they would open the attraction at Six Flags México in 2011.
Attraction
Groups of 30 guests enter a briefing room. Each player is given instructions and battle gear in this room. They are then ushered into the themed arena where the combat takes place. For approximately five minutes two teams of 15 not only battle against each other but also against the intelligent arena and against 12 characters from the Terminator franchise.

Helion Lodge #1 is a Masonic lodge in Huntsville, Alabama. It is the oldest operating lodge of Freemasons in the state. According to Grand Historian Joseph Abram Jackson's Masonry in Alabama, it is "the birthplace of Freemasonry in Alabama." Helion Lodge is also the common name for the building (actually named Eunomia Hall for Eunomia Chapter #5 Royal Arch Masons who financed its construction), built in 1911, where the lodge meets.
History
In 1805, a Revolutionary War veteran named John Hunt built a log cabin at the Big Spring and began what would grow to become the modern city of Huntsville, Alabama. Just six years later, on August 21, 1811, Madison Lodge #21 received its dispensation from the Grand Lodge of Kentucky. In 1812, it received its official charter from the Grand Lodge of Kentucky. John Hunt was among the first members, as was Leroy Pope, who had given the city its original name of Twickenham. On April 6, 1818, a second Lodge was formed in the county, Bethesda Lodge #2. In 1824 the two Lodges combined as Helion Lodge #1 under the Grand Lodge of Alabama.
Helion Lodge survived the dark years of the American Civil War, when Huntsville was often occupied by the invading Union Army. The quiet little town grew rapidly after World War II, when the area became host to both Redstone Arsenal and the Marshall Spaceflight Center. Notable members involved in the growth of Huntsville's defense and space industry are Senator John Sparkman and Mayor Joe W. Davis. Helion Lodge soon came to have the largest membership in the state. As a result, in 1962 a new Lodge was formed in Huntsville, Solar Lodge #914. Most of the members came from Helion Lodge. Five years later, in 1967, a third Huntsville Lodge was formed, Apollo #921. Both younger Lodges consider Helion as their mother Lodge and dual membership is common.
On Wednesday night, August 30th, 1922, Helion was the location of the formation of Twickenham Chapter of The Order of DeMolay; the first chapter of The Order of DeMolay in the state of Alabama.

Mosteiro is the smallest civil parish in the municipality of Lajes das Flores on the Portuguese island of Flores, in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2021 was 19, in an area of .
History
Its toponymy has been debated by historians, although some theories suggest that it was named for the comparable civil parish on the island of São Miguel. The first colonists, motivated to settle here by a man named João Soares, were settlers from the region of Mosteiros, renaming this zone in its honour.
In 1676, the locality of Mosteiro was de-annexed from the parish of Lajes das Flores and included in the ecclesiastical parish of the Fajãs, with its seat in the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios da Fajanzinha.
The adventurer António de Freitas, former seminarian, had emigrated to China, where he made his fortune. Returning from his life in the Far East in 1846, he ordered the construction of the Parochial Church of Mosteiro, in the invocation of the Holy Trinity, in gratitude for God's intervention in saving his possessions during the trip.
In 1850, Mosteiro was elevated to parish, along with Caldeira, on the completion of the parochial church. As related by Francisco Gomes, "at the time of the erection of the parish it was decently ornamented, and provided with vestments, and other objects necessary for the Divine Cult". During this period, the parish included 90 homes, including 300 inhabitants. As Father José António Camões, wrote after describing the bridge of Sargo, he also referred to the small port of Mosteiro "where tragically three or four boats capsized...the small port is part of a small community called "Os Mosteiros", and indicate the existence of two streams, the "Ribeira do Mosteiro" and "Ribeira dos Ladrões" (or Fundão) that ends the district of the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios and Nossa Senhora do Rosário of Lajes". The same historian referred to a population of 31 homes, including 83 men and 92 women, noting: "There are eight tiled houses, and not a man who wears shoes. There is a twenty-year judge with scribe, subject to the jurisdiction of the town of Lajes. The ordinance soldiers of the village are subordinate to the 2nd company in the villa of Lajes."
During the 18th century, with the lack of development and investments, many of the residents from the parish abandoned the parish for prosperous centres in Brazil. This was later supplanted by emigration to the United States.
The parish continued to be part of the municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores, between 18 November 1895 and 13 January 1898, when Lajes was suppressed.
Geography
The parish of Mosteiro is part of the municipality of Lajes das Flores, whose municipal seat is located . With an area of , it was one of the smallest parishes in Portugal, constituted by the settlements of Mosteiro and the locality of Caldeira.
The parish and pure coastal waters is a natural sanctuary for endemic, maritime flora and fauna, many unexplored, offering excellent conditions for fishing, diving and nautical sports.
Economy
Agriculture, herding and a subsistence economy supports the economy of the parish. Cultivation of lands and raising of dairy/cattle are the essential parts of the islands' economy. Almost all the residents raise dairy cattle, on a susbsistence basis, in particular pastures and greenspace, resulting in the associated nickname Green Meat (). Considered a specialty market, the meat produce has become a regional mark for the island.
Mosteiro is the centre of the regional public school for basic and 1st cycle instruction, but is inoperationive due to the lack of students.
Helping to support its nascent tourist market, the parish maintains several historical buildings and structures; these include parochial church, the Império de Divino Espírito Santo, the watermills and lookouts, such as the Chafariz da Caldeira, Cabeço do Sinal, Cabeço da Muda, Vista do Portal Poio and Cruz dos Bredos''.
Architecture
Civic
Haylofts of Mosteiro (), a group of haylofts characterized by two-story buildings of local stone, dating from the 19th century;
Religious
Church of Santíssima Trindade (), an 18th-century, Revivalist temple, comprising a single nave and presbytery, with a well-illuminated interior and ceilings of wood. The principal facade was completed with a triangular frontispiece, marked by a rectangular portico and oculi, while the interior include a high altar, two lateral retables on angles, in addition to a revivalist altarpiece;
Funeral Monument of António Freitas (), situated in the cemetery of Mosteiro, the funeral monument is composed of an urn elevated above four steps over a plinth, while surmounted by cross. The monument includes decorative elements, such as flowers, and to the north, the urn is decorated with a skull and crossbones.

State Route 647 (SR 647) is a state highway in eastern Ohio connecting the city of Martins Ferries with the village of Mount Pleasant. in length, its southern terminus is at SR 7 and its northern terminus is at SR 150.
Route description
SR 647 begins at a signalized intersection with the four-lane divided SR 7 in the city of Martins Ferries, near the Ohio River. Hanover Street continues southeast across a railroad towards the industrial sections of the city. SR 647 and Hanover Street head northwest into downtown Martins Ferry. The state highway briefly follows North 6th Street for about two blocks before turning left onto Carlisle Street. The route slowly climbs in elevation through the developed part of the city but as it exits the downtown residential neighborhood, the route heads up the side of a hill at a steeper slope and includes some hairpin turns. As it exits the city limits, SR 647 heads through hilly terrain and occasionally passes homes as it travels northwest. Upon entering the community of Morningview, the route turns north and then east briefly as it winds its way into a valley. After passing County Road 2 (former Ohio State Route 798), it turns north again and exits Belmont County for Jefferson County. This part of the route ascends in a narrow valley towards Mount Pleasant. At the top of the hill, the route curves west and enters the village limits on Union Street. After traveling through Mount Pleasant, the highway ends at the intersection of Union and Concord Streets; this intersection has SR 150 entering from the west and exiting to the north.

Ponte Pietro Nenni (Italian: "Pietro Nenni bridge") is a bridge crossing the Tiber in Rome, which connects lungotevere Arnaldo da Brescia and lungotevere Michelangelo, in the Quarter Flaminio and Rione Prati respectively.
Description
The bridge, designed by Architect Luigi Moretti and Engineer Silvano Zorzi, was built between 1969 and 1972 and inaugurated in 1980; it was dedicated to Pietro Nenni, socialist leader who had died a month before the inauguration.
It is also commonly known as the "Metro bridge", since it serves the Line A of the Rome Metro, of which it is the only above-ground stretch: the railway track emerges at Via Cesare Beccaria and descends below the road surface on the opposite bank, between Viale Giulio Cesare and Via degli Scipioni. On both sides of the tracks there are vehicular traffic lanes.
The bridge spreads over three spans made of prestressed concrete, for a total length of about 121 meters (399 ft).

The West Montalvo Oil Field is a large and productive oil field on the coast of Ventura County, California, in the United States, in and adjacent to the city of Oxnard, California. Discovered in 1947, it has produced approximately of oil, and retains about 2.2 million recoverable with current technology, in both the onshore and offshore areas. The offshore portion of the field is exploited from wells directionally drilled from onshore near McGrath Lake, from within an enclosure above the high-tide line at McGrath State Beach.
The West Montalvo field was also the first dry natural gas field of commercial value to be discovered in Ventura County; in its lifetime it has produced over of gas.
The field is owned and operated by California Resources Corporation.
Setting
The oil field underlies the portion of coastline just south of the outlet of the Santa Clara River, including several state and county parks (including McGrath State Beach, Mandalay Beach Park, and Oxnard Shores Park). While parts of the oil field are within the city of Oxnard, California, most of it is within an unincorporated region east of the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Gonzales Road, a mixed-use area of agricultural fields interspersed with oil wells and associated production and processing facilities. This area was designated a greenbelt through a joint agreement between the cities of Oxnard and Ventura. The terrain is almost all flat, save for berms and sand dunes at the shoreline. Elevations on the field range from sea level to about above sea level, and drainage is to the west and southwest, via a system of canals. Total productive area of the field is , with 200 of that being offshore.
Some oil field and power generation facilities are in enclosures within the parks and open spaces. A row of wells near McGrath Lake drill into the offshore portion of the field; visitors to McGrath State Beach can walk past them along the beach. Reliant Energy's 560-megawatt gas-fired Mandalay Generating Station is north of and adjacent to Mandalay Beach Park. An oil-gas separator adjacent to the Mandalay plant processes gas from the offshore Santa Clara and Hueneme fields and sells the gas to Reliant for use at the power plant. Mandalay Beach Park consists of of land left in its natural state, without amenities, and contains habitat for the endangered snowy plover.
"McGrath 4 Well No. 1218", an oil well within Mandalay Beach Park, in a walled enclosure is allowed to remain. This oil well is one of the most productive in the entire field, producing over of oil in 2009 alone, over .
The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with cool, rainy winters and warm, rainless summers, in which the heat is moderated by frequent morning coastal low clouds and fog. Annual precipitation is around , almost all in the winter, and all in the form of rain. The mean annual temperature is 56 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit; freezes occur rarely.
Geology
The Montalvo field is an accumulation of oil within an eastward-plunging anticline. Within the anticline, numerous Pliocene-age sand units contain petroleum of various types. These sand units pinch out, and many are lenticular, with impermeable units above and below. The anticline is bounded on the north by a branch of the Oakridge Fault, and the anticline itself is broken in many places by small faults perpendicular to the Oakridge.
Within the upper Pico Formation, many lenticular sand units contain natural gas; underneath this unit is the McGrath Zone, which was the first to be discovered, and which contains oil at an API gravity of 28. Beneath the McGrath, and separated by an unconformity, portions of the Miocene-age Santa Margarita and Monterey Formations show in drilling logs; yet another unconformity marks the top of the Colonia Zone, of Oligocene age, which contains more lenticular and pinched-out reservoirs of oil sands.
History, production and operations
Standard Oil Company of California discovered the field in April 1947 by drilling into the McGrath producing horizon. The first well produced , encouraging further exploration. In 1951, the Colonia Pool was found at , which had a heavier oil with high sulfur content, and following the trend west, discovered the offshore portion of the field in June 1953 by drilling into the Oligocene-age Sespe Formation, where they also found oil at the depth. This producing horizon was also part of the Colonia Zone. This unit remains richly productive.
By the end of 2008, the field was one of the top ten in California by largest production increase of the preceding year.
Ownership
The field has changed owners several times. In 1977, Standard Oil Company of California became Chevron Corporation, and the field was run under that logo. Chevron sold the field to Bush Oil Company of Taft, California, on May 1, 1990. Bush Oil ran the field for only two years, selling it to Berry Petroleum Company in 1992.
In 2007, Venoco acquired the field from Berry Petroleum Company for $63 million; it was sold in 2014 to California Resources Corporation for $200 million.
Methods of improving production
Field operators have tried several enhanced oil recovery projects to improve production rates. In the McGrath pool, gas injection was used from 1956 to 1968, and the zone has been waterflooded since 1963, in an attempt to boost reservoir pressure. Both methods also have been used on the Colonia pool, with gas injection running from 1964 to 1971, and waterflooding since 1960. Enhanced methods have included using water injection to get more tight oil. Oil companies inject the chemical waste water, also called produced water, back into the earth. The presence of water injection wells near directionally drilled oil wells lead one investigative journalist to hypothesize that fracking had occurred.
Refining
Oil produced in the field goes to the small (-per-day) Oxnard Refinery, owned by Tenby Inc., in an unincorporated area on Fifth Street near the eastern Oxnard city limit. This refinery also processes oil from the Oxnard Oil Field upon which the refinery is located. Other petroleum processing facilities nearby include one west of the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Gonzales Road, as well as two near the Santa Clara River, east of Harbor Boulevard.
Spills
In 1991, an unknown amount of oil was spilled.
In 1994, 2 barrels of oil were spilled.

Albastar AS are gliders produced by the Slovenian company Albastar Ltd. They are currently in the development stage.
Albastar AS-13,5m FES
Albastar 13,5m FES is a single-seat motor glider with 13.5 m wingspan designed for FAI 13.5 m class which took its maiden flight in April 2013. To achieve better performance, the new airfoil with flaps was designed. It has provision for Ballistic Recovery System (BRS). The cockpit was designed roomy enough to be used by taller pilots.
The glider has 23 kW front electric sustainer (FES) positioned in the nose which in combination with low takeoff weight is powerful enough to be used for self-launch. This system uses folding propeller which greatly reduces aerodynamic drag when not in use. The take-off roll is 170 m with enough battery capacity to reach 1800 m AGL. However, the glider also incorporates a tow hook mounted in the center of gravity for the classic aerotow.
Two AS-13,5 gliders took part on the 2nd FAI 13.5 m World championship in Szatymaz in 2017.
Albastar AS-18
Albastar AS-18 is a two-seat motor glider with 18 m wingspan. First prototype AS-18M is powered by two-stroke internal combustion engine with the propeller mast mounted behind the cockpit. It has a self-launching capability and unlike other similar gliders, it has the unique feature of starting the engine before the propeller mast is extended, therefore practically eliminating the period of increased drag before the engine is started.
The second prototype, AS-18 GEN is powered by the more powerful version of the FES system. It uses the 42 kW electric motor which is powered by the electric generator driven by the gasoline engine mounted in the fuselage behind the cockpit.

Composite rules shinty–hurling ()—sometimes known simply as shinty–hurling—is a hybrid sport which was developed to facilitate international matches between shinty players and hurling players.
Shinty–hurling is one of few team sports in the world without any dedicated clubs or leagues. It is currently played by both men's and women's teams only in tournaments or once-off internationals. The women's form of the game is called shinty/camogie.
Scotland is the leading team in the sport, having won seventeen of many international series against Ireland to date.
Rules
The rules of the composite sport are designed to allow for neither side to gain an advantage, eliminating or imposing certain restrictions. The goals are those used in hurling, with 3 points for a goal (in the net under the crossbar) and 1 point for a shot over the crossbar. A stationary ball taken straight from the ground and shot over the crossbar scores 2 points. For the 2012 International Series, a goal became worth 5 points in an effort to increase the number of goals. This rule was abandoned for the 2013 series, in favour of the traditional model of 3 points for a goal.
Players may not catch the ball unless they are the goalkeeper (or a defender on the line for a penalty) and this must be released within three steps. Players may not kick the ball, but can drag the ball with their foot.
Although there is a statutory size for the ball to be used in the games, there is often a custom of using a sliotar in one half and a shinty ball in the other. Each half lasts 35 minutes.
History
The first games played were challenge matches between London Camanachd and London GAA in 1896 and Glasgow Cowal and Dublin Celtic in 1897 and 1898, with the first game played at Celtic Park. However, there was then a hiatus until Scottish representative teams and Irish sides took place in the 1920s. Following intermittent international games between Scotland and an all-Ireland team before the Second World War, controversy arose as the British Government put pressure upon the Camanachd Association to cease from co-operating with the Gaelic Athletic Association, disapproving of their perceived anti-British viewpoint
However, universities in both countries kept the link going after the war and this led to a resumption of international fixtures between the two codes in the 1970s.
After a long run of Irish successes, Scotland won four fixtures in a row from 2005 until Ireland reclaimed the title in 2009. Scotland's successes have been marred by a lack of interest from an Irish perspective. Unlike the international rules football tests between Australia and Ireland, few players from the top flight counties participate in the event—though in recent times this trend has bucked and higher ranked Irish players have represented their nation.
2007 also saw the use of compromise rules as a way of developing the Gaelic languages in Ireland and Scotland by the Columba Initiative when Iomain Cholmcille was founded. A team called Alba, made up of Scottish Gaelic speakers, played Míchael Breathnach CLG, from Inverin, Galway. The competition has since expanded to include a team representative of Ulster Gaelic speakers, Fir Uladh, and the Dublin based Gaelic speaking team, Na Gaeil Óga CLG. The first woman's competition was held in 2015 and is played between Alba, Mná Uladh (a camogie team representative of Ulster Gaelic speakers), and Cumann Camógaíochta Cois Fharraige from the Conamara Gaeltacht, Co. Galway.
There are also Scottish/Irish women's and under-21s sides which have competed against one another.
In 2009, the first full shinty/hurling match in the United States took place between Skye Camanachd and the San Francisco Rovers.
In 2010, the fixture was played at Croke Park before the international rules football game and then a return leg was played at the Bught Park two weeks later.
On 28 April 2012 the inaugural match between the teams of Irish Defence Forces and the British Army was played at Bught Park in aid of PoppyScotland.
International series
An international series for men, women and under 21s is played annually, with test matches rotating between venues in Scotland and Ireland. Ireland are the leading team in the series, having won 9 of 16 senior men's test matches. Camogie-Shinty is the women's version of the game.

Kenneth Wagstaff (born 24 November 1942) is an English former footballer noted for his playing career at Mansfield Town and Hull City football clubs. In 2000, club fans of both Mansfield Town and Hull City voted Wagstaff their club's player of the century – the only player to be named by two football league clubs. During club centenary celebrations in 2004 he was voted "The greatest player to play for Hull City AFC" by supporters. He was voted for by both Mansfield and Hull City fans as "all-time favourite player" in 2007.
Career
Wagstaff was born in Langwith, Nottinghamshire. In 1960, as a 17-year-old, he was signed by Mansfield Town F.C's then-manager Raich Carter after playing in Mansfield's youth league. Carter put him in the first team squad and he made his league debut on 30 August 1960. In his first game with Mansfield's first squad, the team won, scoring 2–1 over Rochdale. Wagstaff scored both Mansfield goals and he went on to score 93 goals over 181 appearances for Mansfield Town, attracting attention from larger clubs. On 12 November 1964, Hull City paid a then-record purchase fee of £40,000 for Wagstaff.
Wagstaff scored 31 goals in the 1965–66 promotion season and went on to score 173 goals for Hull City in 378 appearances.
Wagstaff played for Hull City between 1964 and 1975, scoring 197 goals for the club. In the 1970s, Wagstaff joined the Sunshine George Cross Football Club in Melbourne Australia as a player-coach. After a career-ending knee injury, Wagstaff spent a short period on the club's coaching staff.
Retirement and personal life
In November 2002, Wagstaff celebrated his 60th birthday at the Ramada Jarvis Hotel in Willerby with 350 friends, including players from the Hull City 1965–66 Third Division championship team.
Author John Maffin wrote a biography about Wagstaff, Waggy: The Ken Wagstaff Story. Wagstaff co-operated with the author and the book was published in 2002 with a second edition published in 2004.
In 2005, as part of Hull City's club centenary celebrations, Wagstaff was voted by supporters as the "best Hull City player of all time".
After retiring from his football career, Wagstaff ran The Golden Ball pub (since demolished) and then bought The Marlborough club, affectionately known as "Waggies". He has since sold the club and retired, but remains active in philanthropy and charity work in the local Kingston upon Hull community. In 2003, Wagstaff joined a group of footballers in a "World Cup-style tournament" to raise money to assist children with learning difficulties. In 2006, he participated in the Sport Relief Mile in Hull to raise money for marginalised people, and in 2007, he took part in a charity golf tournament at Bridlington Belvedere Golf Club.
Wagstaff's wife Eileen died from breast cancer in August 2007. In February 2008, Wagstaff and his family raised money to start a lifestyle centre in her memory at the Princess Royal Hospital in Saltshouse Road, east Hull. The centre would provide breast cancer patients with diet and lifestyle advice.
After a brief stint during 2009 running the Roos Arms, a village pub in Roos, East Riding of Yorkshire he has since completely retired to spend more time with his family and now lives in Hull.

TER Franche-Comté was the regional rail network serving the Franche-Comté région, France. In 2017 it was merged into the new TER Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.
Since the convention signed in 2002 for a duration of 5 years, between Jean-François Humbert, then president of the Regional council of Franche-Comté and Noël Belin, then regional director of the SNCF, the regional council of Franche-Comté is the organising authority of regional transports. A new agreement, signed on 21 December 2006, by Raymond Forni, president of the Conseil Régional de Franche-Comté and Josiane Beaud, regional directeur of the SNCF, en présence d'Anne-Marie Idrac, présidente of the SNCF, from 2007–2012.
TER railway connections
The two lines Dijon–Dole–Besançon and Besançon–Montbéliard–Belfort essentially form one line, called the Saône–Doubs line. It constitutes the backbone of trips in Franche-Comté with 60% of the passengers and 60% of the Gross profit. It's along this route that the line bypasses highwayss, canals and other railways.
The Revermont line: Besançon–Lons-le-Saunier–Bourg-en-Bresse. Second line by its importance, is, for a large part, a single track (between Saint-Amour and Mouchard).
Besançon–Morteau–La Chaux-de-Fonds : this line has been certified by French normes in 2005. The trains on this line are usually done with SNCF Class X 73500 and SNCF Class X 2800, though occasionally they are upgraded to SNCF Class XR 6200.

Toul-Croix De Metz Airfield is a former military airfield which is located approximately northeast of Toul (Département de Meurthe-et-Moselle, Lorraine); east of Paris.
The airfield had its probable origins as early as 1912, as an Aéronautique Militaire airfield, later being extensively used by the United States Army Air Service. It became a permanent airfield between the wars and during the Phony War with Nazi Germany (1939–1940) was the home of G.C. II/5 (The French Air Force descendant of the World War I Lafayette Escadrille) equipped with American Curtis Hawk 75A fighters. Seized in the Battle of France, it became a Luftwaffe airfield until being captured by the United States Third Army in September 1944. It then became a United States Army Air Forces combat airfield until the end of the war.
After the war, the airfield was redeveloped into a private industrial estate.
History
World War I
Archives concerning the origins of the Toul-Croix de Metz airfield are rather scarce. Some documents show that the area was turned to the Army as soon as 1912, but the "Aero-Guide" of 1913 and the "Guide Michelin pour les Pilotes Militaires" of 1914 mention only two usable airfields around Toul: one at Dommartin, 1 mi. east of town - with a hangar for airships, and military grounds 1.5 mi. west of town.
However, the airfield of Croix de Metz is heavily used by the Aéronautique Militaire as early as August 1914. Two barracks were built each side of the airfield at some time between 1912 and 1916: "Caserne Ferber" on the south side, and "Caserne Gengoult" on the north side, which was later used by the Americans forces, which explain why the Croix de Metz airfield was sometimes called Gengoult Aerodrome. Airships flown from Toul probably departed from Dommartin.
In April 1918 it was turned over to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). When first deployed to France, the first few Aero Squadrons of the AEF were dispersed under various army commands, among other reasons to completed their training. When ready for action and numerous enough, to obtain coordination of aerial activities, some higher organization was required: the United States Army Air Service fighter and bomber Aero Squadrons were thus organized in one Bombardment Group and four Pursuit Groups, meanwhile the observation and reconnaissance Aero Squadrons joined Corps and Army Observation Groups Known American units at Toul were:.
In the first days of September 1918, a detachment of 484th sqn (Construct.) arrived to perform some 1-11/9/18 [préparation offensive Saint Mihiel; retour > Lay St Remy].

As Croix de Metz was one of the most active American airfields, other air units might have been assigned to it during World War I, yet unidentified. The Americans at Toul flew reconnaissance sorties, protected observation aircraft, attacked enemy observation balloons, strafed enemy troops, flew counter-air patrols, and bombed towns, bridges, and railroad stations behind the enemy's lines.
Some of the most illustrious names in early American Army aviation were assigned to Toul during World War I, including Eddie Rickenbacker; Quentin Roosevelt; Frank Luke; Carl Spaatz; Billy Mitchell and others.
The Americans at Toul demobilized and left France after the Armistice on 11 November 1918, the last leaving in early 1919, as can be seen above.
Between the wars
The airfield first appears in the navigation charts in 1920 as a 400 x 900 m landing ground. In 1928, a part of it was assigned to the local "Aero-club Toulois", which seems to be the only permanent user.
The airfield is expanded in 1936, probably at the same time 4 hangars are built, but still with no unit permanently stationed.
When World War II broke out in September 1939, the "Groupe de Chasse II/5" was assigned to Toul-Croix De Metz; the Group's first "escadrille" aircraft sported a "Sioux Head", but it was not before 1942 that the escadron received the lineage of the Lafayette Escadrille, thus becoming "Groupe de Chasse II/5 Lafayette". The Group was equipped with (not so) obsolete Curtiss Hawk Model 75s. From surviving accounts of the squadron during the Battle of France the Hawk-equipped Group claimed 230 confirmed and 80 probable victories in H75s against only 29 aircraft lost in aerial combat. In addition to the French unis, Polish Air Force exiles flew Morane fighters with the "Groupe de Chasse III/1" from the airfield during the early spring weeks before the German offensive into France and the Low Countries.
With the subsequent German Blitzkrieg and the breakout of the Wehrmacht at Sedan the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force was overwhelmed. The few units still on the field surrendered to the Germans along with the French Armed Forces at the Second Armistice at Compiègne on 22 June 1940.
German use during World War II
Shortly after its capture, the airfield was turned over to the Luftwaffe. The airfield was initially used primarily as a training base for ground support units. In September 1942, Zerstörerschule 2 (Fighter-Destroyer School 2) (ZS 2) used the base as a training facility for Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter pilots until February 1944.
Toul became an operational airfield in July 1944, when Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53) arrived at the airfield with Heinkel He 111 medium bombers. The 111s were used as carrier aircraft for launching V-1 Flying Bombs, aimed at targets in Britain. kg 53 withdrew from the airfield at the end of August, ahead of the advancing American Third Army which was moving into the area. Toul-Croix De Metz was attacked by USAAF Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers to attempt to stop these V-1 attacks.
American use during World War II
The IX Engineer Command moved the 826th Engineer Aviation Battalion to Toul airfield on 14 September 1944. The airfield was relatively intact, and began clearing the airport of mines; destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft, and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Subsequently, it became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as Advanced Landing Ground "A-90" Toul-Croix De Metz the next day.
Under American control, Toul-Croix De Metz was initially used as a resupply and casualty evacuation (S&E) airfield, with C-47 Skytrain transports using the airfield frequently, carrying in supplies and moving wounded personnel to hospitals in the rear. In October, the 862d EAB moved in and laid down a 5000' Pierced Steel Planking all-weather runway. The engineers also repaired the barracks and other facilities at the base, allowing it to be used though the winter months.
In November, the 358th Fighter Group moved in with P-47 Thunderbolts and flew operational missions from the base until the beginning of April 1945. The airfield was closed, and returned to French control after the war on 30 October 1945.
Postwar use
In French control after the war, the airfield was closed and for years was left unused. The growing urban area of Toul and the need for other, more pressing reconstruction after the war led the Air Ministry to sell off the property to private interests, and not rebuild it as a military airfield. A major reason was that the airfield was physically small, and the cost to purchase additional land to build a jet runway, and other facilities was very high. In addition, the prospect of jet fighter aircraft taking off and landing over the urbanized area around the airfield was highly undesirable. In 1950 when NATO was looking to locate an American Air Force fighter airfield in the area, given the historical American association with Toul, the World War II airfield at Rosieres En Haye was made available.
United States Army use
In 1951, the abandoned airfield was turned over by the French to the United States Army for use as an Engineering Depot. Army units were assigned to the field to clear the remnants of the World War II Army Airfield and completely re-design the facility. Railroad spurs, new hard-surfaced roads, permanent buildings, warehouses and utilities were put in, and in December 1952 the facility was re-opened as the Toul Engineer Depot.
Initially used as a reserve depot for supplies and equipment, but in 1955 the facility was upgraded to become a major depot supporting USAREUR units in both France and Germany. This was scaled back in 1956 due to budget reductions to support Army Engineering units in France only. Further budget cuts in 1960 led to its consolidation with the Army's Nancy General Depot, and in November 1961 the facility was closed and returned to French military control.
Current use
The French government sold the land and all of the buildings to private interests during the 1960s. Today in aerial photography, clear outlines of former buildings can be seen in grassy areas, as well as the runways and taxiways of the former airfield, the streets put in by the United States Army. It is now an industrial estate.

"Throne Room" is a song by American worship leader, singer, and songwriter Kim Walker-Smith. It was released on March 10, 2017, as the lead single from her third studio album, On My Side (2017). The song was written by Walker-Smith, Jacob Sooter, Lindsay Sweat, and Mia Fieldes. It appeared on the album WOW Hits 2018: Deluxe Edition.
Background
In an interview with Hannah Goodwyn of CBN, Walker-Smith stated:
Critical reception
Timothy Yap of Hallels said the song "is what gives Jesus Culture its patented sound. Bold, anthemic and with their signature epic build-up, 'Throne Room' puts to worship the promise of Hebrews 4:16." Jesus Freak Hideout's Mason Haynie claimed "Walker-Smith takes a well-known idea in 'Throne Room' and makes it all the more reverential by pondering the heaviness of God's name." Kevin Ekmark of Church stated "[Throne Room] is almost haunting with what sounds like angels singing in the background. The strong percussion and build to the chorus help it stands out as the first powerful worship song on the album." Louder Than the Music's Jay Wright proclaimed "we are reminded that in God's holy presence we get captivated 'with angels and saints and all I can say is holy, holy, holy are You God!' With its powerful lyrics, the track has a heavier sound to it, building strongly by the chorus. Kim's vocals match the building music perfectly!"
Music videos
The official music video for the song was released on March 16, 2017 and has garnered over 1.3 million views as of November 2017.

Ace Comics was a comic book series published by David McKay Publications between 1937 and 1949 — starting just before the Golden Age of Comic Books. The title reprinted syndicated newspaper strips owned by King Features Syndicate, following the successful formula of a mix of adventure and humor strips introduced by McKay in their King Comics title in April 1936; some of the strips were transferred from King Comics and continued in Ace Comics from issue #1. Ace Comics #11, the first appearance of The Phantom, is regarded by many to be a key issue in the history of comics, as it introduced to the comics format one of the first of the costumed heroes, leading to the Golden Age of superheroes in comics.
Publication history
The first issue of Ace Comics was published in April 1937, and included the adventures of hunter Jungle Jim written by Flash Gordon writer Alex Raymond, Chic Young's Blondie, and George Herriman's surreal Krazy Kat strip, all three characters going on to appear in every issue of Ace Comics. Issue #11 (cover date February 1938) is notable as a key Golden Age comic, as it introduced to a wider audience one of the first costumed heroes ever to be featured in a comic book, Lee Falk's The Phantom — pre-dating Superman (Action Comics #1, cover date June 1938). The Phantom daily strip, written by Lee Falk and drawn by Ray Moore, then featured in Ace Comics for a 140-issue run, appearing in every issue until the title was cancelled. Initially The Phantom was a four-page story, but from #38 this was increased to eight pages in each issue. Towards the end of the run, the Sunday strips were also included. Many of the strips were edited and cropped from the original newspaper stories, and the text was often rewritten also.
As well as Jungle Jim and The Phantom, which ran throughout the series, Hal Foster's knight's tale of Prince Valiant was also a long-running adventure feature, published in issues 26-134. Other adventure strips that appeared included Zane Grey's Western character Tex Thorne in early issues, the adventures of orphan Tim Tyler in Tim Tyler's Luck and both by Blondie writer/artist Chic Young's brother Lyman Young. Tim Tyler's Luck ran in every issue of Ace Comics, while the Curley Harper strip ended with issue 100, although a single strip just called Curley Harper appeared in issue #107. Later issues reprinted the Flash Gordon-like space adventures of Brick Bradford and The Lone Ranger strip, both transferred from the King Comics title.
The Blondie strip also appeared in every issue of Ace Comics, as did classic the humor strip The Katzenjammer Kids by Rudolph Dirks. Other humor strips included Pete the Tramp by Clarence D. Russell, Tillie the Toiler by Russ Westover, Billy DeBeck's Barney Google, Jimmy Hatlo's They'll Do It Every Time and Paul Robinson's Etta Kett were presented throughout the run, although all of these titles missed the odd issue. The strip Seein' Stars which ran in the first 50 issues, was written by Arthur Beeman and was based around the Hollywood film industry — cartoon versions of a number of Hollywood stars, including Fred Astaire, Betty Grable and Judy Garland guested.
Drawn in a similar style to Winsor McCay's work, the fantasy strip The Pussycat Princess (a story originally titled Pussycat Princess, A Fairytale For Boys, Girls And Other Children), by Grace Drayton and Ed Anthony, also featured in early issues of Ace Comics run. Drayton was a well-known and important early cartoonist who died only a year after starting this delightful fairytale series. Another classic Golden Age artist whose work appeared in a number of issues was C.C.Beck (creator of Fawcett's Captain Marvel). Six issues of Ace Comics contained single-page Captain Tootsie strips - advertisements for Tootsie Roll confectionery with a short adventure on the page, with a costume patterned on Captain Marvel's.
As well as syndicated strips, most issues also carried text stories, editorials, and factual pages. Many of the stories, such as White Buffalo in issues #35-36, were written by R. G. Montgomery, who wrote short Western tales in magazines in the 1920s and 1930s. Ruth Plumly Thompson, who wrote a number of the books in the Oz series after L. Frank Baum died in 1919, also wrote a considerable number of editorial pages. Ace Comics also featured single-panel cartoons, probably the best known of which, Private Breger Abroad, was drawn by celebrated World War II cartoonist Dave Breger. The factual strip Ripley's Believe It Or Not! was reprinted in early issues of Ace Comics, while other factual pages, such as Stamp Spotlight, Sports In Pictures and News In Pictures, appeared regularly at various times during the run. Two series in 1941-2 covered the early events of World War II at sea — Battle of the Atlantic and Battle for the Seven Seas. These were written and drawn by Edgar Franklin Wittmack, known for his stylized magazine covers in the 1920s and 1930s.
An unusual feature for the day was the Young Reporters page, which included readers' letters and comments. Competitions and prizes were also advertised in early numbers, and puzzle pages were also featured.
Ace Comics was cancelled with issue #151 (October 1949), although as that issue contained an ad for the next Phantom series, it can be assumed the decision on cancellation was made after #151 left the printer.

Otto Wels (15 September 1873 – 16 September 1939) was a German politician who served as a member of parliament from 1912 to 1933 and as the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) from 1919 until his death in 1939. His 1933 speech in the Reichstag in opposition to Hitler and against the Enabling Act marked the end of the Weimar Republic prior to the Act passing into law.
Life and career
Born in Berlin on 15 September 1873, Wels was the son of an innkeeper (Johann Wels and his wife Johanne). The restaurant served as a meeting place for early SPD supporters exposing Wels to the workers movement at a young age. In 1891, he began an apprenticeship as a paper hanger and joined the SPD. Around 1893, he married Bertha Antonie Reske, a seamstress and they had two sons, Walter and Hugo. In the early 1890s, he represented other workers in the Berlin Craftsmens Chamber and was elected the first Chairman of the local SPD branch. From 1895 to 1897 he served his military service period in the German Army but suffered from harassment by officers due to his politics (he was not granted leave for his entire service period). On his finishing military service, he enrolled at the Workers Educational Society in Berlin for further education before attempting to return to politics. He was unsuccessful in being relected as SPD local chairman (District Five) but continued to campaign until he was elected as a representative in the new SPD party organisation in 1901.
From 1906 he worked as a trade union official, party secretary in the Province of Brandenburg and the Vorwärts press committee. In 1912 he was elected to the Reichstag and with the support of August Bebel joined the SPD executive committee the next year. His role on the executive committee allowed him to take a central role in the development of the SPD.
In the German Revolution of 9 November 1918, Wels was a member of the Berlin workers' council (Arbeiter-und Soldatenrat) of the SPD and USPD. He was appointed military commander of the city and consequently had to deal with the occupation of the Stadtschloss by revolutionary forces including violent fights with Freikorps units. Upon the election of Friedrich Ebert as Reich President on 11 February 1919 he acted as presiding officer of the SPD and was formally elected chairman, together with Hermann Müller, on 14 June.
In 1920, Wels and Carl Legien organised the general strike that helped defeat the right-wing Kapp Putsch, after which Wels enforced the resignation of his party colleague Gustav Noske as Reich Minister of Defence. He argued for the foundation of the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold and the Iron Front paramilitary organisations against the rising extremist forces of the SA, Der Stahlhelm and Rotfrontkämpferbund. From 1923 Wels also became a member of the executive of the Labour and Socialist International. After the 1930 Reichstag election, Wels advocated the toleration of the cabinet of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, who had lost the support of the DNVP deputies. Even after the Preußenschlag of July 1932 against Otto Braun's government in the Free State of Prussia, he spoke against a general strike, but after the Reichstag election of November 1932 he rejected any negotiations with the new chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher.
Enabling Act
On 23 March 1933 Wels was the only member of the Reichstag to speak against Adolf Hitler's Enabling Act (the "Law for Removing the Distress of People and Reich"). The vote took place during the last session of the multiparty Reichstag, on 23 March 1933. Because the Reichstag building had suffered heavy fire damage in February, the March session was held in Berlin's Kroll Opera House. Despite the incipient persecution of opposition politicians and the presence of the SA, he made a courageous speech opposing the Enabling Act, which gave the Reich cabinet the right to pass laws without the consent of the Reichstag for a period of four years. The Social Democrats were inventive and resistant but eventually were overpowered by the Nazis.
Speaking directly to Hitler, Wels proclaimed,
All 94 SPD members of parliament who were present voted against the act. Using the powers of the Reichstag Fire Decree, the Nazis had detained several SPD deputies, and others had already fled into exile. The Communists had been banned and so could not vote. The rest of the Reichstag voted in favour. However, Nazi intimidation had worked so well that even if all 107 SPD deputies had been present and voted against it, the Enabling Act would have still passed with the required two-thirds majority for a constitutional amendment.
The passage of the Enabling Act marked the end of parliamentary democracy in Germany and formed the legal authority for Hitler's dictatorship. Within weeks of the passage of the Enabling Act, the Hitler government banned the SPD, and the other German political parties chose to dissolve to avoid persecution, making the Nazi Party the only legal political party in Germany.
Exile and death
In June 1933, Wels went into exile in the Territory of the Saar Basin, which at the time was under League of Nations control. From there he moved to exile in Prague. In Prague, he established Sopade, the exile organization of the SPD. In August 1933, he was deprived of his German citizenship.
As a result of the Munich Agreement, Wels had to leave Prague and went to Paris at the end of 1938, where he died on 16 September 1939 at the age of 66. He is buried in the Cimetière Nouveau cemetery at Châtenay-Malabry.
Legacy
In his memoirs, the former Chancellor Heinrich Brüning described Otto Wels as "Germany's bravest man in the fight against Hitler".

Austrheim Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Austrheim Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Austrheim on the island of Fosnøyna. It is the church for the Austrheim parish which is part of the Nordhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1865 using plans drawn up by the architect Askild Åse. The church seats about 355 people.
History
The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1329, but it was not built that year. The first church was a wooden stave church that was likely built during the 13th century. That old church was replaced by a log church during the early 1600s. On 16 November 1710, the church tower was badly damaged by lightning and major repairs were carried out afterwards to repair the tower and its supporting structures. In 1865, a new church was built about to the northeast of the old church site. It was consecrated on 2 April 1865 by the Bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland. After the new church completed, the old church was demolished.

A model maker is a professional craftsperson who creates a three-dimensional representation of a design or concept. Most products in use and in development today first take form as a model. This "model" may be an exacting duplicate (prototype) of the future design or a simple mock-up of the general shape or concept. Many prototype models are used for testing physical properties of the design, others for usability and marketing studies.
Mock-ups are generally used as part of the design process to help convey each new iteration. Some model makers specialize in "scale models" that allow an easier grasp of the whole design or for portability of the model to a trade show or an architect or client's office. Other scale models are used in museum displays and in the movie special effects industry. Model makers work in many environments from private studio/shops to corporate design and engineering facilities to research laboratories.
The model maker must be highly skilled in the use of many machines, such as manual lathes, manual mills, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machines, lasers, wire EDM, water jet saws, tig welders, sheet metal fabrication tools and wood working tools. Fabrication processes model makers take part in are powder coating, shearing, punching, plating, folding, forming and anodizing. Some model makers also use increasingly automated processes, for example cutting parts directly with digital data from computer-aided design plans on a CNC mill or creating the parts through rapid prototyping. Hand tools used by a model maker are an exacto knife, tweezers, sprue cutter, tape, glue, paint, and paint brushes.
There are two basic processes used by the model maker to create models: additive and subtractive. Additive can be as simple as adding clay to create a form, sculpting and smoothing to the final shape. Body fillers, foam and resins are also used in the same manner. Most rapid prototyping technologies are based on the additive process, solidifying thin layered sections or slices one on top of each other. Subtractive is like whittling a solid block of wood or chiseling stone to the desired form. Most milling and other machining methods are subtractive, progressively using smaller and finer tools to remove material from the rough shape to get to the level of detail needed in the final model.
Model makers may use a combination of these methods and technologies to create the model in the most expeditious manner. The parts are usually test fitted, then sanded and painted to represent the intended finish or look. Model makers are required to recreate many faux finishes like brick, stone, grass, molded plastic textures, glass, skin and even water.

Henry Domercant (born December 30, 1980) is an American and Bosnian-Herzegovinian professional basketball coach and former player. He is currently the head coach of the Windy City Bulls in the NBA G League, the development team for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association. He played college basketball for Eastern Illinois, and was an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection in 2012.
College career
Domercant attended Eastern Illinois, being second in NCAA Division I scoring both in the 2001–02 season averaging 26.4 points as a junior, and again as a senior in 2002–03 with an average of 27.9 per game. He finished with EIU and Ohio Valley Conference records of 2,602 career points in his four college seasons.
Professional career
Domercant was selected in the 2003 Continental Basketball Association (CBA) draft by the Yakima Sun Kings. However, he decided to begin his professional career in Turkey for the 2003–04 season with Pınar Karşıyaka. He moved to Efes Pilsen in 2004 and played two seasons for the club.

The Bliss–Leavitt Mark 8 torpedo was the United States Navy's first 21-inch by 21-foot torpedo. Although introduced prior to World War I, most of its combat use was by PT boats in World War II. The torpedo was originally designed in 1911 by Frank McDowell Leavitt of the E. W. Bliss Company and entered full mass production in 1913 at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island. It was deployed on destroyers and battleships during World War I and cruisers built in the 1920s. All US battleships and most cruisers had their torpedo tubes removed by 1941. The Mark 8 remained in service through World War II on older destroyers, primarily the Wickes and Clemson classes. It also equipped PT boats early in World War II, but was replaced by the Mark 13 torpedo on most of these in mid-1943.
Under the Lend-Lease Act, about 600 Mark 8 torpedoes were issued to the United Kingdom for use with 50 pre-1930 destroyers it received under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.
Design
The design was originally intended to be used on destroyers in an anti-surface ship role. When it was first released, it was a highly advanced torpedo, but when it was actually deployed into service during World War II it was showing its age and unable to compete with modern torpedo technology. The low speed of the torpedo was one of the complaints; its Japanese counterpart, the Type 93 torpedo, was significantly faster and more difficult to spot in the water.
Deployment difficulties
The Mark 8 had many technical difficulties with its design that would be a bane to the torpedomen who would use them. The first issue came with the process of simply launching the torpedo, which was fraught with its own set of difficulties. The gyro in the torpedo was sensitive when it was first launched and it would need to be launched from an even keel, otherwise the torpedo would lose stability when it hit the water. The other issue concerned the launching mechanism. The initial system was set with a black powder charge to push the torpedo out of the tube. This was a problem in the South Pacific, where the humid climate would cause these charges to misfire, sometimes not putting enough force behind the torpedo to fully eject it from the tube. One other risk of these misfires was what is called "hot running", where the torpedo would run in its tube. Though the warhead could not detonate, the motor would overheat and explode without water to cool it, sending splinters across the deck. Another issue was that the tubes were heavily lubricated with oil and grease to ensure that the torpedo was smoothly launched from the tube. Sometimes during launch, the charge would ignite the lubricants in the tube causing a fire emitting black smoke that would reveal the location of the torpedo boat.
The torpedo lacked the explosive power of newer models. It carried less than 500 pounds of TNT-based explosives, which was far from a guaranteed ship kill. This frustrated many captains who, when hitting an enemy dead on, had the warhead detonate but not sink the target, and many targets escaped.

Euphrates Volcano () was a joint operations room/coalition established during the Syrian Civil War. It mainly consisted of the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and certain factions of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). The group fought to expel the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from Aleppo and Raqqa provinces. In an October 2015 publication, the Washington D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War considered Euphrates Volcano as one of the "powerbrokers" in Aleppo Province, being primarily "anti-ISIS" but not necessarily "anti-regime".
History
In September 2014, several Free Syrian Army groups released a video addressing the Siege of Kobani in which they issued a joint statement pledging to defend the city from ISIS and asking for aid from western countries to do so. The Wall Street Journal noted that the flag of the YPG featured prominently in the video, indicating the possibility of YPG cooperation with the FSA.
This was proved true later that year, when YPG member started to train FSA members, eventually leading to the establishment of the Euphrates Volcano, which deepened the alliance between the PYD and Kobani FSA.
The capture of Tell Abyad from ISIL in July 2015 was a major success of the Euphrates Volcano operations room.
On 10 October 2015, the Euphrates Volcano was one of the founding members of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Soon after the formation of the SDF, the Euphrates Volcano was superseded by various other groups and military councils within the SDF. It was one of the few operations rooms which had been set up by non-government forces during the civil war that were able to transform into a "semi-stable" alliance.

Joaquín Navarro Perona (2 August 1921 – 6 November 2002) was a Spanish professional footballer who played as a defender.
Club career
Born in Gavà, Barcelona, Catalonia, Navarro moved to local and La Liga giants FC Barcelona in 1941, from hometown club CF Gavà. In his only season at the Camp Nou he won the Copa del Generalísimo, but appeared sparingly in the league albeit scoring three goals.
Subsequently, Navarro joined neighbouring CE Sabadell FC in Segunda División, promoting in his first year. In the following six seasons he suffered two top flight relegations with the club, and netted a career-best five goals in 21 games in the 1947–48 campaign as the Arlequinats finished in 12th position, narrowly avoiding another drop.
In the summer of 1949, Navarro signed for Real Madrid, playing 21 matches (one goal) in his first season. During his eight-year spell with the Merengues he took part in 272 official games and won five major titles, including three leagues and the 1955–56 edition of the European Cup, contributing with three appearances in the latter competition.
Navarro retired in 1957 at the age of 36, playing 288 top level matches over 14 seasons. He died on 6 November 2002 in Barbastro, Aragon, aged 81.
International career
Navarro played five times for Spain, during slightly less than one year. He made his debut on 7 December 1952 in a 0–1 friendly loss to Argentina, in Madrid.
Additionally, Navarro was the first Spanish player to be selected to a World XI FIFA team, appearing in a 4–4 draw against England at Wembley on 21 October 1953 and being subsequently nicknamed El Fifo.
Personal life
Navarro's younger brother, Alfonso (born 8 April 1929), was also a footballer. A forward, he too played for Barcelona (1946–50, 1954–56) and Real Madrid (1950–51), also representing Real Valladolid, CA Osasuna and CD Condal in an 11-year professional career.
Navarro II died 10 August 1969 at age 40 after a long illness.

This is a list of Swedish Air Force weapons.
Designating a weapon
Most weapons were designated by an m/xx number, the digits normally being the last two digits of the weapon's year of introduction to service. Missiles were designated with two digits after the "Rb" designation, which is short for "Robot", the Swedish word for missile.
With air-to-air missiles odd numbers indicated radar seekers like the Rb 71 or Sky Flash, even numbers indicate IR seekers like the Rb 98 or IRIS-T off-boresight air-to-air missile.
The abbreviations used for some weapons are derived from the type of weapon, arak being short for "attack rocket", and akan being short for "automatic cannon".
Air-to-air missiles
Rb 321: Experimental active radar homing missile, meant to arm the J 35 Draken. It never entered production, as the SAF instead opted for Sidewinder and Falcon missiles.
RB 24 Sidewinder: The air force's first operational air-to-air missile. Imported AIM-9B Sidewinder.
Rb 72: Experimental short and medium range infrared-guided air-to-air missile for the fighter-interceptor JA 37 version of the Saab 37 Viggen ("Jaktviggen").
RB 24J: Swedish designation of the AIM-9P3 Sidewinder. License-made with a Swedish-designed laser fuze.
RB 74: Swedish designation of the imported AIM-9L Sidewinder, sometimes called the Rb 24L. Carried by the JA 37 Jaktviggen and the AJS 37 upgrade of the AJ 37.
RB 27: The Hughes Falcon GAR-3A missile in Swedish service equipped with new proximity fuze, and used on the J 35F/J Saab Draken.
RB 28 Hughes Falcon GAR-4 IR seeker in a GAR-2 body.
RB 71 The British Sky Flash semiactive air-to-air missile, carried by the JA 37 Jaktviggen.
RB 98: Swedish designation of the IRIS-T air-to-air missile with IR seeking capabilities. Rb98 is also currently in use as a surface-to-air missile.
RB 99: The US AIM-120 AMRAAM licensed and produced in Sweden for the Swedish Air Force under the name Rb99.
RB 101: The MBDA Meteor in service with the Swedish Air Force since 11th July 2016.
Air-to-surface missiles
RB 05 A joystick-controlled dual-mode missile developed by Bofors, primarily intended for the AJ 37 Viggen, but also fitted to the Sk 60B. The fuze could be set by the pilot to impact mode for ground targets, or proximity mode for attacking slow air targets such as bombers.
RB 75 Maverick TV-guided, fire-and-forget air-to-surface missile corresponding to the AGM-65A/B. Carried by the AJ 37 Viggen and the later AJS 37 variants.
Anti-ship missiles
Rb 302: experimental anti-ship missile tested 1947-1955.
Rb 315: anti-ship missile.
Rb 04: Swedish-built anti-ship missile in use since the early 1960s in C/D/E versions, carried by the A 32A Lansen and AJ 37 Viggen.

A Bilby tower is a type of steel survey tower used by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1927 to 1984. It is named after Jasper S. Bilby who designed it in 1926. In 1927, Herbert Hoover, then the Secretary of Commerce, commended Bilby's tower "for its cost and time efficiency" and cited the surveyor's service as "essential to the United States government".
Features
The Bilby tower has two unconnected parts – an internal tower for mounting surveying instruments and an external tower for surveyors. This separation allowed for isolating the instruments from the vibrations induced by people, which increased the precision of measurements.
It was portable, reusable and quick to assemble and dismantle. Its quick erection made it possible to conduct surveying rapidly.
The last Bilby tower
The last remaining tower, at St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, was dismantled by the Surveyors Historical Society in 2012 and re-erected in 2013 at the Osgood Trails Park in Osgood, Indiana, the home town of Bilby.

The Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista was a political programmatic manifesto that advocated Italy's participation in World War I on the side of the Triple Entente against the Central Powers. It was drawn up on 5 October 1914 by revolutionary syndicalists and interventionists members of the Unione Sindacale Italiana. The usefulness of the First World War was asserted as an historical moment indispensable for the development of more advanced societies in a political-social sense. The manifesto inspired the formation of the Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria.
The promoting committee was made up of: Decio Bacchi, Michele Bianchi, Ugo Clerici, Filippo Corridoni, Amilcare De Ambris, Attilio Deffenu, Aurelio Galassi, Angelo Oliviero Olivetti, Decio Papa, Cesare Rossi, Silvio Rossi, Sincere Rugarli and Libero Tancredi.

Manas Kongpan (1956 – 2 June 2021) was a Thai convicted human trafficker and military commander. From 2008 to 2015, he led the Thai army's policies towards Rohingya refugees, before being arrested on multiple charges, including ordering refugees to be marooned at sea without any means of survival and extorting ransoms from families of refugees. In 2017, he was convicted of the charges, and served the rest of this life in prison.
Career
In 2004, he participated in the Krue Se Mosque Raid that left over 30 dead. From 2005 to 2006, he led a special task force as part of the 25th Infantry Regiment in Ranong, tasked with cracking down on illegal migrants crossing the country's waters and on gamblers heading to casinos in Kawthaung.
In 2007, he was involved in a controversial drug raid, where the original official reports stated that 30 million baht had been recovered from a suspected drug dealer's house, but where later investigations found that the total amount had been over 70 million. Manas are not charged with any crimes in the investigations due to a lack of evidence.
In 2008, as a Colonel, he was named regional commander of the Internal Security Operations Command, tasked with running Thailand's policies towards the Rohingya.
In 2009 he rejected accusations that the Thai military had set Rohingya refugees adrift at sea with no engines, pledging to resign if he was presented with proof of ill-treatment and stating that the accusations "all come from journalists who have problems with Thailand and just want to slander us." In 2012, he again defended the military's policies in a statement to Reuters, stating that "when someone tries to enter the country illegally, it's our job to send them back. Thailand doesn't have the capacity to take them in, so people shouldn't criticize so much."
In 2013, he was promoted to the head of the 42nd Military Circle in Songkhla. In 2015, he was promoted to Lieutenant General and named a military advisor to the government.
A Thai police investigation in 2015 into secret jungle prisons in the south of the country where traffickers tortured refugees and held them for ransom led to Manas. The investigation found large sums of money being deposited into Manas' bank accounts from other suspects, including over $600,000 from politician Sunan Saengthong. Later that year, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He soon surrendered himself to Thai police, denying guilt for the charges.
In July 2017, he was convicted of several charges, including trafficking and taking bribes, being sentenced to 27 years in prison.
In November 2019, his prison term was increased to 82 years.
Death
On 2 June 2021, Kongpan died of a heart attack in prison, at the age of 65.

St. Augustine's College at Duckspool Abbeyside in Dungarvan is a co-educational secondary school in Ireland. It was founded and is now conducted by the Irish Augustinians. The school has been located at its Duckspool campus, Abbeyside since 1972. This follows a long history of providing education at the former campus which was located at Main St. and Friary St. in Dungarvan town. At this time it was a boarding school for boys and continued as such at the new campus until 1990 when the decision was taken to become a co-educational facility. In time the boarding section was scaled down until it became a day school in the mid 90's.
Sports
The school encourages its students in many different areas of sport. The school's facilities include a 40 × 20 ft handball alley with glass back wall and viewing gallery, a 60 × 30 ft handball alley, a 120 × 60 ft gym, 6 GAA pitches, 1 soccer pitch, an 8-lane sprint track, a long & triple jump track, shot put, discus and hammer Circles, an all-weather hockey pitch, and also facilities for the high jump, javelin, and pole vault events.
Since 1997, St Augustine's College has competed in a mini-Olympics type of European sporting event known as Superschools. The college hosted the event in 1998 and 2008 and won both times. In the 24 years of the competition, St. Augustine's College have won nine times, eight of which have been consecutive – the only school in Europe to achieve this. Usually schools from eight other countries compete. Their most recent win was in 2018.
Patron Saint
The college is named in honour of the 4th-century saint, Augustine of Hippo. Other English-speaking Augustinian Schools with the same patron include Richland, New Jersey; San Diego, California – both in the United States; Manila in the Philippines; a school in Malta, another Irish one in New Ross, and one in Sydney, Australia.
Augustine was a key figure in the doctrinal development of Western Christianity and is often referred to as a "Doctor of the Church" by Roman Catholics. Two of his surviving works, namely "The Confessions" (his autobiography) and "The City of God", are regarded as Western classics and are still read by Christians around the world. Augustine is often considered one of the theological fountainheads of Reformation, because of his teaching on salvation and grace, Martin Luther himself also having been an Augustinian friar. Augustine was not a Biblical fundamentalist.

María Josefa Errázuriz Guilisasti, also known as "Pepa" Errázuriz, is a Chilean politician. She was mayor of Providencia between 2012 and 2016. She currently serves as councilor of the same commune since 2021.
Early life and education
She studied at the Villa María Academy in Santiago, from where she graduated in 1969. Later, she studied sociology at the University of Chile. She is the daughter of the married couple made up of Octavio Errázuriz Letelier and Virginia Guilisasti Tagle. She is the sister of Octavio Errázuriz, ambassador to his country's the United States between 1989 and 1990, and Virginia Errázuriz, visual artist, and cousin of businessman and union leader Rafael Guilisasti.
Career
Josefa has worked in towns organizing and managing youth centers, sports clubs, cultural centers, parish organizations, and territorial coordinators. In 1974, she began to work as a secretary at the UNDP. After retiring, as operations manager, she focused on citizen work through non-governmental organizations, such as the Union of Neighborhood Boards of Providencia (2006-2008), Ciudad Viva, the Chilean Association of Patrimonial Zones and Neighborhoods, the Association for a Santiago on a Human Scale and the Network of Citizen Territories.
Primary elections in Providencia were organized by the opposition to Mayor Cristián Labbé, a member of the Independent Democratic Union. There she was the winner with 39.7%, beating Cristóbal Bellolio of Red Liberal and Javier Insulza of the Socialist Party. In the elections of October 28, she was elected mayor of Providencia, defeating Labbé, who had served as mayor of the commune for sixteen years.
She took office on December 6, 2012. She unsuccessfully sought re-election in the 2016 municipal elections, as she was defeated by the Chilean candidate Vamos Evelyn Matthei.
Controversies
In an interview conducted in September 2012, during her campaign for mayor of Providencia, Josefa Errázuriz stated that she was against same-sex marriage, which triggered criticism from LGBT. Subsequently, the then-candidate retracted her statement, specifying that she was in favor of same-sex marriage.
In June 2013, Josefa Errázuriz was involved in a controversy when she began the process of changing the name of Avenida 11 de Septiembre to Avenida Nueva Providencia, its original name. A group of councilors from the Alliance —a center-right coalition— boycotted the session where the eventual name change would be voted on, calling it a "media whim", and alleged a contradiction between the participatory vocation of the mayor and her refusal to submit the decision to a communal plebiscite was achieved quorum to meet and the change was approved after a 4–1 vote in councilors and the support of the mayor.
In July 2013, in the context of the student protests, a group of representatives of the Liceo Carmela Carvajal accused the mayor of "washing her hands" by endorsing the seizures, a situation that occurred after the mayor ignored their call to use the public force and evict the municipal schools and high schools.
In December 2014, an article in the newspaper El Mostrador reported that on June 28, 2013, the mayor used the municipal palace located in Providencia to celebrate her nephew's marriage, which again earned her the target of criticism. The mayor replied that "...any neighbor can occupy the Falabella Palace."
In 2017, the municipality of Providencia filed a complaint against three former employees Eliécer Martínez, Mariano Rosenzvaig, and Jaime Brito Jara, later the complaint was extended to the already former mayor Josefa Errazuriz, for her role as president of the Board of Directors of the Corporation of Social development. This complaint is due to the possible embezzlement of funds in addition to the misuse of school grants. This allegation is based on an external audit by KPMG which found a total shortfall of $6.925 million between state grants and CDS monies, much of it unsupported. The greatest losses were concentrated in the Administration areas, with 2,968 million pesos; Education, with 2,792 million pesos; and Health, with 1,164 million pesos. These crimes were committed in her period between 2014 and 2016. The involvement of Josefa Errázuriz in the complaint is due to two reasons: 1) the alternate secretary of the corporation, Eliécer Martínez, who also happened to be the municipal finance director in her term was selected by the mayor 2) legally the chairman of the board of directors is responsible for overseeing the use of the entity's money, for which complicity or negligence on the part of her administration as chairman of the board is assumed.

The Underground Research Laboratory was a test site for deep geological repository of nuclear waste operated by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited's (AECL's) Whiteshell Laboratories near Lac du Bonnet in Manitoba, Canada. The site was built inside a large granite batholith, typical of the Canadian Shield. The site was selected in 1980, construction began in 1982 and it opened in 1985. No radioactive material was stored at the site, it was used purely for measurements of water exchange, rock movement, and other issues that would affect the safety of such materials. The site was also used by a variety of international users. As part of the wider wind-down of AECL activities, the decision was made to close the URL in 2003. Cleanup work began in 2006 and completed in 2010. The site continues to host a single international experiment measuring water leakage through a massive clay plug.
History
Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Program
Through the 1970s the issue of storing nuclear waste became a serious concern within the nuclear industry. The rocks of the Canadian Shield, many of which have been physically unchanged for billions of years, seemed like a natural candidate for such storage. The fact that high-grade nuclear fuel was held in such formations for billions of years in nature was especially attractive; such deposits, like at Cigar Lake in northern Saskatchewan, were powerful evidence that this mode of storage was secure for geological time frames.
In 1978, the governments of Canada and Ontario agreed to fund the "Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Program" (NFWMP) to consider the deep geological repository as a solution to the growing inventory of spent fuel. At the time, it was estimated the fleet of CANDU reactors would produce 3.6 million fuel bundles by the end of life of existing reactors. Organized by the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB), AECL was tasked with developing the required technology, while Ontario Hydro would pay for the actual storage and be responsible for transport of the waste to and from a production site. An updated agreement was signed in 1981, with the explicit instructions that no nuclear material would ever be placed in the experimental site.
AECL's original plans for long-term waste disposal was a three-stage process; in the first stage the fuel would be stored in the existing spent fuel pools located at the reactor sites for a period of six to ten years. After that time the overall decay rates have decreased to the point where it can be safely moved. For the second stage, the fuel would be placed in an underground facility for a period of about 300 years. By that time the most active gamma ray emitters have burned off and the fuel becomes much safer to handle. The final stage would see the fuel moved to surface sites, but over time this was abandoned and the entire time was to be spent underground.
Building the underground portion in the Canadian Shield eliminated concerns about geological events exposing the waste en masse; it is easy to find large batholiths that have been intact for billions of years. However, these also include fractures of various sizes and the nature of water movement through these sorts of rock formation was a topic of limited research. In 1978, the NFWMP decided to build a test site to answer two primary questions, one was to characterize the water flow and chemistry in ancient rocks of this type, and the other was to test a proposed sealing system that consisted of a layer of clay sandwiched between engineered concrete walls.
Site selection and construction
Whiteshell, built on top of the 1400 km2 2.6 BYa Lac du Bonnet batholith, was asked to find a suitable site. The criterion was that there was at least one square kilometer of partially exposed rock on the surface, that it had not previously been used for excavation, that there was power available, and that it was within reasonable distance of Whiteshell. A total of eight sites were considered before one about northeast of Whiteshell was selected, part of the same batholith.
Between 1980 and 1983 a series of seven deep boreholes and many smaller ones were made around the site to characterize it. The shaft surface site was built during 1982 and 1983, and the first major digging began on 12 May 1984. The first level, 240 Level, was completed in 1987, along with the secondary ventilation shaft. The main shaft was extended to 443 m deep by 1988, and the excavation of the 420 Level was completed in 1991. In total, 34,270 cubic meters were excavated for a total cost of about $40 million.
Operations
The first set of nine major experiments was designed in 1989 and began operations in 1990. Some of these involved measurements of the flow of water in the various rock formations, while others were concerned with the engineered seals and container technologies. Many new experiments joined the original series, including ones on blast effects from nearby mining operations, as well as evacuations. New groups from the US, Japan and France were collaborating on new experiments like the Tunnel Sealing Experiment and the Quarried Block Radionuclide Migration Experiment. The University of Toronto also ran the "mine-by" experiment on the effects of excavating within an existing mine site.
The AECL decided to close the Whiteshell facility in 1994 and had started the process of winding down operations. In 1996, the AECL held public hearings to present the results from many of the original URL experiments. Although they found some concerns in the research, the AECB decided enough was known to move ahead to begin selecting a production repository site. In 1997, Ontario Hydro took over the experiments related to long-term storage, including many of the experiments at the URL, reorganized as the Deep Geologic Repository Technology Program (DGRTP). Yearly costs for the URL were on the order of $3 million with incomes on the order of $9 to $10 million, although about 70% of that was from Ontario Hydro. Ontario Hydro, which became Ontario Power Generation in 1999, announced its intention to stop funding research at the site, in favour of moving forward with production.
Closure
In 2003, AECL announced it would be shutting down the URL, unless a buyer or tenant could be found. This did not happen, and the site was officially closed in June 2003. Closure work began in 2006, removing equipment from the now unused levels. By the time this process was complete in 2010, all that remained was the tracks used by the underground railway system. A large plug made of clay sandwiched between two plates of high-performance concrete was placed in the main shaft in an ongoing experiment to measure the performance of the plug as a way of blocking the flow of water between aquifers.
Description
The site consisted of a main shaft deep with two main working levels at and . Smaller levels were constructed at and as drilling support sites. A ventilation shaft carrying propane-heated air paralleled the main shaft.
The levels were built because the rock formation includes two aquifers, a freshwater one at higher levels and a saltwater one deeper. A key concern for the URL was developing technologies to prevent mixing of the two aquifers.
The ultimate result of the URL was a ten-volume Environmental Impact Statement about the entire deep geologic repository concept.

Ram Latchan, better known as K.R. Latchan (15 June 1940 - 15 June 1988) was a businessman, farmer and politician based in Nausori, Fiji. He was a member of the Alliance Party and House of Representatives from 1977-1987.
Biography
K. R. Latchan grew up as a dairy farmer at his family farm in Tailevu Province of Fiji. His father, Khurbhur, immigrated from India in 1915 and worked as a Sirdar in the Public Works Department before settling as a farmer in the Tailevu Province. Khurbur died when Latchan was 9 years of age, he later adopted his father's name into his initial. His mother, Ram Kuar, raised her children as a single parent at the family farm.
He came into prominence as a businessman through K.R. Latchan Buses Limited, a major bus and coach service provider operating in Suva, Nausori and other eastern districts in Fiji. He started the business with the help of his mother, who had purchased the first bus, which he then expanded into a modern fleet. Latchan met Bijma Wati while operating his bus service, they married in 1966 and had 6 children. Latchan began establishing Dominion Oil Refinery Fiji Ltd in 1986, Fiji's first oil recycling and blending plant. Following his death, the company was renamed Pacoil Fiji Ltd in 1990, and company operations discontinued in 1999 due to policy changes by the Fiji Government.
Latchan became a member of the Alliance Party and wrested the seat of East Central National Constituency from Vijay R. Singh in the selection for the Alliance candidate for the 1977 Fijian General Election. He was re-elected in the 1982 and 1987 Fijian General Elections. Latchan's major political achievements includes the successful proposition for death duty to be abolished by the government. He was a member of the House of Representatives until the 1987 Fijian coups d'état.
He suffered a heart attack and passed away in Nausori, Fiji on 15 June 1988.

All-in wrestling was the first wave of professional wrestling in the United Kingdom to be based on the catch as catch can style of wrestling. It was conducted under the All-In rules of 1930 in which (unlike Olympic freestyle wrestling) no holds were prohibited.
The name All In later became synonymous with more anarchic professional wrestling shows, leading to censure by local authorities by the late 1930s. Consequently, the All In label was disowned by most British wrestling promoters following the adoption of the 1947 Mountevans rules.
History
Professional wrestling in the Greco Roman style had enjoyed considerable popularity in Britain during the Edwardian era, but had dwindled and died out by the outbreak of World War I. While various styles of amateur wrestling continued as legitimate sports, grappling as a promotional business did not return to Britain until the beginning of the 1930s when the success of the more worked aspects of professional wrestling in America, like gimmickry and showmanship, were introduced to British wrestling.
It was with this revival that the more submission-based Catch As Catch Can wrestle style, which had already replaced Greco Roman wrestling as the dominant style of professional wrestling in the United States back in the 1890s, became the new dominant style in Britain. With Lancashire catch-as-catch-can already a major amateur sport particularly in Northern England, there existed a ready-made source of potential recruits to professional wrestling.
Amateur wrestler Sir Atholl Oakeley got together with fellow grappler Henry Irslinger to launch one of the first promotions to employ the new style of wrestling which was coined "All-in" wrestling. Though, like many wrestlers throughout the business, Oakley would claim his wrestling was entirely legitimate, his claim was highly dubious. According to Pro Wrestling Press, Under the British Wrestling Association banner, Oakley's promotion took off with wrestlers such as Tommy Mann, Black Butcher Johnson, Jack Pye, Norman the Butcher, College Boy, and Jack Sherry on the roster, while Oakley himself would win a series of matches to be crowned the first British Heavyweight Champion.
The business was reaching one of its highest points at the time, with the best part of forty regular venues in London alone. The 1930s craze for 'All in' wrestling went by the wayside when quality was sacrificed for quantity. The great demand for wrestling, however, meant there were not enough skilled amateurs to go around, and many promoters switched to more violent styles, with weapons and chairshots part of the proceedings. Women wrestlers and mud-filled rings also became common place. In the late 1930s, the London County Council banned professional wrestling, leaving the business in rough shape just before World War II. Permits were also revoked in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1938. In April 1938, Justice Charles of the King's Bench Division in London declared that it was "not a sport."
After the war, attempts to relaunch the business in 1947 failed to catch on with journalists who condemned the gimmickry calling the show fake. The revelation of this, and the general chaos which had surrounded All In Wrestling prior to the War, prompted Admiral Lord Mountevans, a fan of the sport, to get together with Commander Campbell (a member of the popular "The Brains Trust" radio panel show), member of parliament Maurice Webb and Olympic wrestler Norman Morell to create a committee to produce official rules for wrestling. Subsequently, the term All In was largely disowned by British promoters, who now referred to their style of wrestling as Modern Freestyle.
In popular culture
Despite the rejection of the name "All In" by British wrestling promoters, the term continued to be used in the UK to refer to professional wrestling - often in a derogatory sense by non-fans. An example of its use in this context is in the Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch "All In Cricket" which depicts two cricketers dueling with cricket bats in a wrestling ring.
English translations of Mythologies by Roland Barthes have frequently rendered the French term Le Catch as All In wrestling, (despite Barthes having written the book in France in the 1950s).

Douglas Francis Jerrold (Scarborough 3 August 1893 – 1964) was a British journalist and publisher. As editor of The English Review from 1931 to 1935, he was a vocal supporter of fascism in Italy and of Francoist Spain. He was personally involved in the events of July 1936 when two British intelligence agents piloted an aircraft from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, taking General Francisco Franco with them and thereby helped to spark the military coup that ignited the Spanish Civil War.
Early life
Jerrold was born in Scarborough in 1893, the son of Sidney Douglas Jerrold and Maud Francis Goodrich. He was a descendant of the Victorian dramatist and writer Douglas William Jerrold, one of the founders of Punch. He served as an officer in the Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division during the First World War, seeing action at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. One of his fellow officers in the Hawke Battalion was the writer and humourist A P Herbert. In the early postwar period, Jerrold wrote histories of both the Battalion and the Division.
Jerrold was admitted to the Middle Temple on 20 November 1918, but was not called to the Bar.
Career
Publishing
Jerrold became a director of Eyre & Spottiswoode in 1929, chairman in 1945 and retired in 1958. Between 1944 and 1948, Graham Greene was his director, in charge of the fiction list.
Politics
Jerrold was at his core a Tory and was hopeful of a career in politics, but he was critical of the alliance between the Conservative Party and big business; he felt that the party had become too nakedly capitalist. His views were not popular with the party leadership, and in 1931, Jerrold's hopes of a parliamentary seat were dashed by Central Office.
The English Review and the New English Review
Sidelined in mainstream politics, Jerrold became editor of The English Review, which he ran from 1931 to 1935. He advocated "real Toryism as opposed to the plutocratic Conservatism represented by the official party", under the relatively liberal leadership of Stanley Baldwin. He was a romantic anticapitalist and a devout Roman Catholic who was strongly attracted to the fascism of Mussolini's Italy, the Catholic nationalism of Franco, and the rule of Antonio Salazar in Portugal as well as to that of Engelbert Dollfuss in Austria. In addition, Jerrold, unlike his English Review colleague, the historian Sir Charles Petrie, was an imperialist who was opposed to Britain's policy in India, which had recognised the inevitability of self-rule. Moreover, Jerrold favoured a greatly-strengthened executive government at home, if not an outright dictatorship. If not a fascist, Jerrold was undeniably sympathetic to fascism.
On 21 November 1933, Jerrold's English Review hosted a dinner, presided over by Lord Carson, which was intended to be the climax of Jerrold's campaign for a new corporatist approach to government. However, the dinner was not as successful as Jerrold hoped. The 350 guests were united in their opposition to the National Government but otherwise held divergent views. Soon afterwards, Jerrold gave his views on parliamentary democracy:
There is no folly more fashionable than the saying that the English will never tolerate a dictatorship. Under constitutional forms of a very flimsy character the English have invariably insisted on being governed either by a close oligarchy or a virtual dictatorship.... It is because the party machines have notably failed to govern that they are losing the public confidence, and unless Parliament under universal franchise can fulfil the indispensable task of leadership, a dictatorship is not only inevitable but necessary.
– Douglas Jerrold, Current comments, English Review, December 1933
In 1945, he launched and ran a successor, the New English Review, later known as the English Review Magazine, with Charles Petrie and support from the Conservative party. In 1950, this merged with the National Review.
Fascist sympathies
In a July 1933 article in the English Review, Jerrold argued that because of the threat of communism to Britain, "the forcible overthrow of Herr Hitler's administration would be a disaster". Jerrold also joined the January Club, founded by Oswald Mosley in January 1934, to generate sympathy and some element of respectability for fascism and particularly to court conservative opinion. The January Club was not explicitly fascist but was "in sympathy with the fascist movement". Meetings were held over dinners at London hotels, where its leaders advanced a corporatist agenda and insisted that "the present democratic system of government must be changed". At the same time, Jerrold was no Nazi and supported the efforts of Mussolini to avenge the 1934 murder of Dollfuss, which had been carried out by pro-Hitler forces.
Spanish Civil War
During the Spanish Civil War, Jerrold strongly supported the Nationalist cause of General Francisco Franco and was among those who argued that the destruction of Guernica had been caused not by Nationalist bombers but by retreating Republican forces.
In his 1938 book The Future of Freedom: Notes on Christianity and Politics, Jerrold outlined his support for the pro-Catholic dictatorships of Franco and Mussolini. He wrote, "Christians not only can but must wish and pray for General Franco's success".
Jerrold, in fact, took an active and personal role in Franco's successful coup. He had been involved in the events of July 1936, when Captain Cecil Bebb and Major Hugh Pollard piloted a de Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, taking Franco with them and thereby igniting the Spanish Civil War. The flight itself was planned over lunch at Simpson's-in-the-Strand, where Jerrold met with the journalist Luis Bolín, London correspondent of the ABC newspaper and later Franco's senior press advisor. Jerrold then recruited Pollard to join the enterprise, along with Pollard's daughter Diana and one of her friends as "cover".

Ireneo della Croce (1625 – 1713) was a Carmelite preacher and chronicler. Croce was born in Trieste. He lived in the monasteries of Venice and Padova, but visited his hometown frequently. His magnum opus (Historia antica e moderna, sacra e profana ... della città di Trieste ... fin'a quest'anno 1698) was printed in Venice with funds from the Trieste Comune and some private citizens. In spite of its title, the book stopped in the year 1000. A second part, which chronicled Trieste up to 1702, was published in 1881. Ireneo della Croce died in Venice in 1713.
A street in Trieste was dedicated to him.

William Soone or Zoone (fl. 1540–1575) was an English jurist and cartographer.
Life
Soone was educated at Cambridge University, where he matriculated at Michaelhouse in 1544. He graduated B.A. 1547, and proceeded M.A. at some date after 1549. He became doctor of civil and canon laws, probably at some university on the continent. The bursars' accounts of Caius College show that he was resident at Gonville Hall, probably as a fellow, from 1548 to 1555. In 1561 he became regius professor of civil law, and in June of that year was admitted fellow of Trinity Hall.
He would not conform to the Church of England, and, leaving Cambridge, went abroad. His successor in the professorship, William Clerke, was appointed in 1563. Soone is said to have resided at Paris, Dol, Freiburg, and Padua, and to have been a professor of law for some time at Leuven. From Leuven he went, most likely, to Antwerp, where he acted as assistant to Abraham Ortelius.
In 1572 he was at Cologne. He then passed to Rome, and had some papal appointment.
Works
In Cologne he published ‘Gulielmi Sooni Vantesdeni Auditor sive Pomponius Mela disputator de Situ Orbis'. Part of this rare book, the ‘Novi incolæ orbis terrarum,' is copied from that of Arnold Mylius and published by Ortelius in the 1570 edition of the ‘Theatrum.' Accordingly Ortelius complained, and Soone offered explanations dated from Cologne, 31 August 1572.
Soone also copied the map of Cambridge which Richard Lyne had drawn for John Caius's ‘History of the University' (1574), and published his copy in Georg Braun and Hogenberg's ‘Civitates Orbis terrarum' (1575?). With this map went a description of the university.

Fang Zheng (born October 14, 1966) is a former student protester who was seriously injured during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. During the evacuation of the Square in the early morning of June 4, Fang was run over by a People's Liberation Army tank, which led to the amputation of both his legs. He is currently the president of Chinese Democracy Education Foundation.
Early life and education
Fang was born in Hefei City, Anhui. From early childhood, he was a sports enthusiast and was inspired by China's return to the Olympic Games in 1984 to enroll at Beijing Sport University.
Involvement during the June Fourth Crackdown
Fang had been in Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3 and early hours of June 4 and participated in a sit-in with fellow students at the Monument to the People's Heroes. As the students reached Chang'an Avenue at Liubukou, they were bombarded with gas that caused a female student to faint from shock beside Fang. Fang picked up the female student and pushed her to safety over a guardrail along the sidewalk. While Fang was aiding the female student, he saw in the corner of his eye a tank approaching. He was unable to save himself in time as the tank ran over both of Fang's legs and dragged him for a short distance. At that moment, Fang lost consciousness and was brought to Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, where he underwent a double amputation. Fang's right leg was amputated at the thigh, and his left leg below the knee.
According to Fang, while in hospital, he was being investigated by the Public Security Bureau in an attempt to conceal the fact that students were attacked as they were leaving the square. For instance, at the hospital the Public Security officers prevented Fang from speaking out about the incident. Upon Fang's return to school, he continued to face scrutiny and investigation by school officials attempting to suppress the incident by accusing Fang of being violent and having provoked the attack.
During the school's investigation into the facts leading up to Fang's incident, he asked the female student to testify on his behalf but she refused by stating that she could no longer remember what had happened and would later claim that she was not with him at the time of the incident.
Post-Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989
After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Fang was pressured by the Chinese government to admit that his injuries were from a road accident. Fang refused, which resulted in Beijing Sport University's withholding of Fang's university degree and denying him a work assignment. Fang's involvement in the protests also led to legal complications that prevented him from registering his household and his marriage. Also, Fang withdrew his membership from the Chinese Communist Party.
Sport competition
Fang, undeterred by his disability and political persecution, continued to pursue his passion of sport. In 1992 Fang represented Beijing at the third All-China Disabled Athletic Games in Guangzhou during which he won two gold medals and broke two records for the Far East and South Pacific region.
In 1994, as China's national champion discus thrower among disabled athletes, Fang was barred from representing China at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled in Beijing. Fang did not compete and was sent home before the competition after Communist Party officials discovered that his disability had resulted from the military crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. In response to his barring, Fang stated that “Even though I was injured on June 4, I should be treated the same as any other disabled man, but, in reality, the situation has proved to be different” and that “there should be no connection between my injury and the cause of my injury.” During training in the lead up to the Games, Fang was told by Communist Party officials overseeing the Games to avoid foreign journalists and to avoid answering any questions about the cause of his injury during news conferences in the event that he won a medal. Although Fang had agreed to the terms, he was later barred from competing. The official explanation for barring Fang from the Games was that the discus event was to be cancelled due to a lack of entrants from other countries. The event was later won by the only entrant, Martin Peter of New Zealand.
In a Sky News interview during the lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Fang was prevented from retelling his account of the tank incident by government minders explaining that it was “something related to some sensitive issue on the history of China” and that “it would be great if we can skip this.”
Immigration to the United States and Standing-Up Celebration
In August 2008 before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Fang was issued a passport by the Chinese government. Fang, his wife Zhu Jin, and daughter Grace arrived in the United States in February 2009.
By 2009, Fang had been using a wheelchair for twenty years. A few months after his arrival in the United States and with the help of specialists such as Dr. Terrance Sheehan and the donation of prosthetic legs by Medical Center Orthotics and Prosthetics, Fang was able to walk again.
In 2009, an event was held in Washington, DC to celebrate Fang Zheng's standing-up.
The event was attended by Fang and his family, members of congress, media, and fellow Chinese dissidents including Yang Jianli, Feng Congde and Chai Ling. Chai Ling, a student leader of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, described her experience at the celebration, “When the music went up and Fang started to dance with his wife, tears came to my eyes. I pictured a day when all the survivors of Tiananmen could stand up like Fang Zheng with their loved ones to celebrate life, love, and triumph over adversity.” Yang Jianli, who was also a student leader, described Fang's story, “In the past 20 years, in his spirit, Fang Zheng has been standing — even without legs… but today he is standing up. It is my sincere hope that we Chinese people will stand up with Fang Zheng." After Fang's dance with his wife, Fang stated that “This is a feeling of new hope for me” and “at the same time, it's also a feeling of new hope for China.”
Activism
On the twentieth anniversary of the June Fourth crackdown, Fang testified in front of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the United States Congress about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and his experiences since the event. He testified that since the June Fourth crackdown, the government has refused to admit to any wrongdoing, has not taken responsibility for its actions and has been mistreating and persecuting victims in the decades following the massacre. Also, Fang made a call for China to establish a committee for truth to find out who ordered the massacre in an effort to achieve justice for victims and true freedom for all of China.
On the twenty-third anniversary of the June Fourth crackdown, Fang attended an annual rally and candle-light vigil at Victoria Park in Hong Kong. At the memorial, Fang gave a speech in which he stated “I have come to talk to people, especially young people, so that they can know the truth about the June 4 killings…” and that “the most effective weapon to fight the communist regime is to refuse to forget what the government wants us to forget, and to refuse to forget what the government has done.” During his trip to Hong Kong, he also visited activists from the Hong Kong Federation of Students who had been participating in a 64-hour hunger strike at Times Square (Hong Kong) in Causeway Bay.
Fang is the president of Chinese Democracy Education Foundation, an organization “promoting the common principle and general ideas of the prosperity and progress of Chinese society for democracy, freedom, human rights and constitutional reform.”

Pace is the suburban bus and regional paratransit division of the Regional Transportation Authority in the Chicago metropolitan area. It was created in 1983 by the RTA Act, which established the formula that provides funding to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Metra, and Pace. The various agencies providing bus service in the Chicago suburbs were merged under the Suburban Bus Division, which rebranded as Pace in 1984. In 2013, Pace had 39.925 million riders. Pace is not an acronym, but a marketing name.
Pace's headquarters are in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Pace is governed by a 13-member Board of Directors, 12 of which are current and former suburban mayors, with the other being the Commissioner of the Chicago Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, to represent the city's paratransit riders.
History
In 2011, Pace received its first diesel-electric hybrid buses from Orion Bus Industries, two years before Orion folded. These Orion VII 3G buses are the first buses in the Pace fleet to not be powered directly by diesel. In 2015, Pace received its first fleet of compressed natural gas buses from ElDorado National, these buses operate mainly in the southern suburbs.
Service area
The six counties that Pace serves are Cook, Lake, Will, Kane, McHenry, and DuPage. Some of Pace's bus routes also go to Chicago and Indiana. In some areas, notably Evanston, River Forest, Oak Park, and Skokie, both Pace and the Chicago Transit Authority provide service.
Many of Pace's route terminals are located at CTA rail stations and bus terminals and Metra stations. The CTA and Pace have shared a payment system since 2014 called Ventra. Ventra accounts are required to obtain transfers. In 2015, Metra regional rail was added to the Ventra app.
Pace buses generally have longer routes than CTA buses. Due to its geographic service area, service is provided by eleven operating divisions (see below), as well as under agreements with several municipalities and private operators (school bus and motor coach companies). Pace buses provide service from the suburbs to various special events in the city, such as Routes 282 and 779 for Chicago Cubs games, Routes 773, 774 and 775 for Chicago White Sox games, Routes 236, 768, 769 and 776 for Chicago Bears games, Route 222 provides extra service to the Allstate Arena in Rosemont for events scheduled there, Route 284 to Six Flags Great America, Route 387 for events at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview.
Services
Pace Bus
The majority of Pace bus routes run daily, seven days a week. Other routes run Monday through Saturday, weekdays only, or weekday rush hours only. One route, 352 Halsted, runs 24 hours a day/7 days a week, and four routes 390, 392, 395 and 890, run only for weekday UPS shifts changes.
During weekday rush hours, Pace buses are authorized to use the shoulder of the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway, Edens Expressway, and Stevenson Expressway to avoid traffic congestion.
Pace Pulse
Pace began operating a new rapid transit service between the Jefferson Park Transit Center and Golf Mill Shopping Center on August 11, 2019. The new Pulse service overlaps with part of Pace route 270 which saw a reduction in the route's service frequency.
I-90 Express
In December 2016, Pace began an on-highway BRT express bus service between Rosemont Transportation Center and Elgin on the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway. The service uses "flex lanes" to avoid traffic and features train station like stops.
ADA services
Pace is responsible for ADA paratransit service in its service area, and, effective July 1, 2006, for paratransit service in Chicago. Pace also coordinates various Dial-a-Ride projects, usually sponsored by various municipalities and townships. One of the largest is Ride DuPage, sponsored by Du Page County Human Services. All Pace buses are wheelchair accessible and have racks accommodating one bicycle, available during all hours of operation. Pace claims itself as the nation's largest paratransit service provider, providing approximately 17,000 daily trips on paratransit, dial-a-ride and ADvAntage vanpools.
Vanpool incentive program
Pace operates a Vanpool Incentive Program, where groups save by commuting together in a van owned and maintained by Pace and driven by one of the participants. There is also a Municipal Vanpool Program, under which Pace provides a van to a municipality, for any public transportation purpose (such as demand response service for senior citizens).
Operational structure
Given Pace's large service area, it is broken up into eleven operating divisions. Additionally, Niles, Highland Park and Schaumburg operate routes on behalf of Pace.
Bus fleet
Individual units in a series may be retired or out of service (also, a few units in a mostly retired series might still be operating).
No buses with fleet numbers ending in 13 (20400–20485 consists of 85 buses, and there is no 20413).
Some routes operated with paratransit or community vehicles.
Announced on 4/5/2022: Proterra won a $26.5M contract from Pace Suburban Bus to deliver 20 Proterra ZX5 Max electric transit buses (675kWh battery) and EV fleet charging infrastructure, with the first electric bus delivery in 2023.

The Cardinal and Theological Virtues is a lunette fresco by Raphael found on the south wall of the Stanza della Segnatura in the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican. Three of the cardinal virtues are personified as statuesque women seated in a bucolic landscape and the theological virtues are depicted by putti. The fresco was a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the private apartments of Pope Julius II. These rooms are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello. After completing his three monumental frescoes Disputation of the Holy Sacrament, The Parnassus, and The School of Athens in the Stanza della Segnatura, Raphael painted the Cardinal and Theological Virtues in 1511.
Description
The walls containing frescoes in the Stanza della Segnatura depict four branches of human knowledge: Philosophy (School of Athens), Religion (Disputation), Poetry (Parnassus), and Law (Virtues). The fourth wall containing the Virtues addresses both the civil law of the secular state and the canon law of the Church. Accordingly, three classical cardinal virtues (Fortitude, Prudence and Temperance) are attended by five putti, three of whom depict the theological virtues of Charity, Hope, and Faith.
On the left, Raphael painted Fortitude. Armor-clad, she caresses a lion with her left hand while grasping a sapling of black oak with her right. The oak tree symbolizes strength and alludes to the Della Rovere family to which Pope Julius II belonged. A putto representing Charity harvests acorns from the oak branch. Fortitude's seated posture and the folds of her clothing are copied directly from a modello Raphael had seen of Michelangelo's Moses.
Prominently seated in the center is Prudence. On her breast is an effigy of a winged Gorgon to ward off deceit and fraud. Janus-like, her head has two faces shown in profile. Her youthful feminine face looks forward into a mirror. This is an allegory of wisdom and knowledge of the present. The backward-facing visage of the old man peers into a past for sound judgment predicated on experience. His view is enhanced by the flaming torch held by a putto depicting Hope.
Temperance sits on the right. She holds the bridle of restraint and is accompanied by a putto portraying Faith who points upward to heaven with his right hand.
The fourth cardinal virtue, Justice, isn't included in the scene. Instead, she is depicted holding scales and a sword in a tondo on the ceiling directly above the fresco. The more prominent position of Justice is explained by the emphasis Plato placed on this fourth virtue. He introduced it to ensure the other three cardinal virtues existed in harmony.
The other two frescoes found lower on the wall also portray scenes concerning the law. To the left of the window is a fresco designed by Raphael but executed by his studio. It depicts the Emperor Justinian receiving the civil code known as the Pandects of the Corpus Juris Civilis from Tribonian. To the right of the window, Pope Gregory IX (as portrayed by Julius II) receives the code of canon law known as the Decretals from Raymond of Penyafort.

Computer simulation is a prominent method in organizational studies and strategic management. While there are many uses for computer simulation (including the development of engineering systems inside high-technology firms), most academics in the fields of strategic management and organizational studies have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. More recently, however, researchers have also started to apply computer simulation to understand organizational behaviour at a more micro-level, focusing on individual and interpersonal cognition and behavior such as team working.
While the strategy researchers have tended to focus on testing theories of firm performance, many organizational theorists are focused on more descriptive theories, the one uniting theme has been the use of computational models to either verify or extend theories. It is perhaps no accident that those researchers using computational simulation have been inspired by ideas from biological modeling, ecology, theoretical physics and thermodynamics, chaos theory, complexity theory and organization studies since these methods have also been fruitfully used in those areas.
Basic distinctions/definitions
Researchers studying organizations and firms using computer simulations utilize a variety of basic distinctions and definitions that are common in computational science
Agent-based vs Equation-based: agent-based models unfold according to the interactions of relatively simple actions, while equation-based models unfold numerically based on a variety of dynamic or steady-state equations (Note: some argue this is something of a false distinction since some agent based models use equations to direct the behavior of their agents)
Model: simplified versions of the real world that contain only essential elements of theoretical interest
Complexity of the model: the number of conceptual parts in the model and the connections between those parts
Deterministic vs. Stochastic: deterministic models unfold exactly as specified by some pre-specified logic, while stochastic models depend on a variety of draws from probability distributions
Optimizing vs. Descriptive: models with actors that either seek optimums (like the peaks in fitness landscapes) or do not
Methodological approaches
There are a variety of different methodological approaches in the area of computational simulation. These include but are not limited to the following. (Note: this list is not Mutually Exclusive nor Collectively Exhaustive, but tries to be fair to the dominant trends. For three different taxonomies see Carley 2001; Davis et al. 2007; Dooley 2002)
Agent-based models: computational models investigating the interaction of multiple agents (many of the following approaches can be 'agent-based' as well)
Cellular automata: models exploring multiple actors in physical space whose behavior is based on rules
Dynamic network models: any model representing actors and non-actor entities (tasks, resources, locations, beliefs, etc.) as connected through relational links as in dynamic network analysis
Genetic Algorithms: models of agents whose genetic information can evolve over time
Equation-based (or non-linear modeling): models using (typically non-linear) equations that determine the future state of its systems
Social Network models: any model representing actors as connected through stereotypical 'ties' as in social network analysis
Stochastic Simulation: models that involve random variables or source of stochasticity
System dynamics: equation-based approach using casual-loops and stocks & flows of resources
NK modeling: actors modeled as N nodes linked through K connections that are (typically) trying to reach the peak of a fitness landscape
Early research
Early research in strategy and organizations using computational simulation concerned itself with either the macro-behavior of systems or specific organizational mechanisms. Highlights of early research included:
Cohen, March, & Olsen's (1972) Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice modeled organizations as a set of solutions seeking problems in a rather anarchic 'garbage can'-esque organization.
March's (1991) study of Exploration and Exploitation in Organizational Learning utilized John Holland's (1975) basic explore/exploit distinction to show the value of slow learners in organizations.
Nelson & Winter's (1982) Evolutionary theory of economic change used a simulation to show that an evolutionary model could produce the same sort of GDP / productivity numbers as neo-classical rational choice theorizing.
Later research
Later research using computational simulation flowered in the 1990s and beyond. Highlights include:
Carroll & Harrison's (1998) model of organizational demography and culture
Davis, Eisenhardt & Bingham's (2009) model of organization structure in unpredictable environments
Gavetti, & Levinthal's (2000) model of cognitive and experiential search
Levinthal's (1997) NK model of adaptation on rugged fitness landscapes
Rivkin's (2000) study of strategic imitation
Rudolph & Repenning's (2002) model of disastrous tipping points
Sastry's (1997) model of punctuated organizational change
Zott's (2003) model of strategic evolution and dynamic capabilities

The Steinlach is a river with a length of in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is a tributary to the Neckar.
It has its source in the Eckenbachgraben, a gap in the Swabian Alb mountain range. The source is on the territory of the town of Mössingen, on an elevation of above sea level. The Steinlach flows into a northerly direction. After taking up several streams outside of Mössingen, it flows through Ofterdingen, Nehren and Dußlingen to Tübingen, where it discharges into the Neckar.
Geography
History
The Steinlach has its source east of Mössinger District Talheim]] and west of Ruchberges at about 710 meters above sea Level in a northeastern side valley of the Eckenbachgraben, a gorge between five and ten meters deep below the Traufkante of the Swabian Alb. The source outlet of the somewhat longer left upper reaches from the Eckenbachgraben shifts with the karst water level of the Swabian Alb. The sources of both branches are just still located in the municipal area of Sonnenbühl.
The Steinlach enters the Steinlachtal near Talheim in the Alb foothills and is then strengthened by the Weiherbach, which is longer at its mouth and has a much larger catchment area. It now flows approximately northwest, takes the Öschenbach from the right one kilometer before Mössingen and then crosses Mössingen on its western course. After the Tannbach in Ofterdingen, which is also a considerable stream, flows from the south-southwest, it first follows its flow direction. But already from the isolated mill in Nehren it flows constantly northwards until the mouth. After the next village Dußlingen, its largest tributary, the Wiesaz, flows from the right, close to its powder mill. In the following short valley section forest heights move close to the river for the first time since Talheim, on the left and on the right side. From the right side the Ehrenbach coming from direction Ohmenhausen flows into the river at Bläsibad. On now straightened run through the Tübinger district Derendingen and finally through the southern part of the city centre of Tübingen, it reaches the Neckar, to which it flows from the right at about 317.5 meters above Sea Level, less than half a kilometre below the Neckarinsel.
The Steinlach flows into the river Steinlach after its almost 26 ‰ km long path with an average river bed gradient of 15 ‰ about 393 meters below its source.
Catchment area
The Steinlach drains almost 142 km² at the Albtrauf around Mössingen and Gomaringen and in the Albvorland north to the Neckar. Its catchment area borders on its northeastern side already a little upstream of its mouth on the catchment area of the Echaz, the next large right tributary of the Neckar. On the southeast side, the European Watershed runs along the Albtrauf along the Albtrauf from the Rhine on this side to the Danube on the other side, direct competitor to the Danube is the Lauchert with its tributaries and its partly long underground karst tributaries. Behind the short southwestern watershed the Starzel now runs again to the Neckar above the Steinlach. The following neighbouring rivers behind, of which only the Katzenbach and possibly also the Bühlertalbach have some importance, drain the forest area of the Rammert, which extends adjacent to this side to the estuary of Tübingen.
The highest altitudes are all on the Albtrauf at the southeastern watershed, where the terrain rarely falls below 800 meters above Sea Level. The Monkberg south of Talheim above the headwaters of the Wangenbach reaches 884.4 m above Sea Level, the second highest Bolberg left above the valley slope of the upper Öschenbach 8808 meters above Sea Level.

Geology
Through retrograde erosion (geology) the Steinlach has contributed to the formation of the Swabian layered landscape. On its way into the Neckar valley it cuts into all rock layers from White Jurassic down to the reed sandstone, the Stuttgart Formation of the Keuper. At morphologically hard rock layers waterfalls occur, for example at the Untere Mühle near Mössingen and northeast of Ofterdingen not far from the sawmill. Near Mössingen it cuts through several meters thick periglacial Limestone gravel surfaces, which probably led to the name Steinlach. It passes through narrow valley areas, especially in the Mössinger town area and north of the Pulvermühle. The Steinlach flows through the Mössinger gravel plain in a curved course and later on it deepens into the underlying layers of the Black Jura. At the Pulvermühle it has cut through the stratigraphic package of the Stubensandstein (Löwenstein Formation), but there it already runs in a wide sole notch valley. At its mouth it has deposited an overhanging gravel fan, which pushed the course of the Neckar to the north and on which parts of today's southern city of Tübingen were built. The deposition of this estuary delta slowed down the runoff and led to the filling of the sole notch valley up to Dußlingen. In Ofterdingen the Steinlach flows on the Arieten Limestone Bank, a fossil-rich layer of the Black Jura, Lias. Alpha. A section of the creek bed between Schillerstraße and Uhlandstraße was put under protection as a geological natural monument Ofterdinger Schneckenpflaster, because there are especially many stone cores of the name-giving ammonite Arietites bucklandi on the surface. The entrance of the stone puddle into the layers of the Lias Alpha near Ofterdingen caused the deflection of the course to the northeast and let the waterfall below the village develop.
Significance for the settlement
Due to the humid climate with abundant precipitation throughout the year and the almost constant water supply, numerous Old Germanic villages were founded along the Steinlach (Mössingen, Ofterdingen, Dußlingen). The Germanic peasant clans used the Steinlach for drinking and process water purposes and as receiving waters for their sewage. Because the Steinlach had a permanent water supply and there are sections with a high gradient, mills settled on its banks early on. With the beginning of industrialization, industries with high water and energy requirements, such as textiles and later the chemical industry, also settled on its banks.
Water extraction and discharge of waste water had a strong impact on the water regime of the Steinlach and reduced its water quality. The protection of the traffic routes in the Steinlach valley and the southern part of Tübingen from Steinlach floods made it necessary to straighten the previously natural course of the Steinlach between Dußlingen and Tübingen, and thus to permanently impair it. The concreting of the Steinlach bed within Ofterdingen, which was carried out as early as the 1970s, also served the purpose of flood defence. At the same time, the mechanical-biological collective sewage treatment plant of the Abwasserzweckverband der Steinlach-Anliegergemeinden south of Derendingen as well as numerous rainwater retention basins were built. The water quality of the Steinlach was thus improved and flood peaks could be smoothed. However, the water yield of the Steinlach decreased, which has a negative effect on the water regime of the stream, especially during dry periods. The withdrawal of water, e.g. to supply water to gardens, is then mostly prohibited by the authorities.

Anthony Raymond DeCorse (November 16, 1922 – November 3, 2011) was an American sculptor, painter, musician, and well known entertainer in the Buffalo, New York area. His major public sculptures include the Rust Bucket monument in the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, the Father and Son Memorial in Buffalo's Veterans Park, and the commemorative plaque in Tony Sisti Park in Buffalo. DeCorse began drawing, sculpting, and entertaining at an early age. In addition to his paintings and sculptures, he was known for his ethnic and folk music, playing the guitar, piano, and many other instruments. For his accomplishments, he was honored by Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown who proclaimed September 17, 2009 Tony DeCorse Day.
Early life and education
DeCorse was born in Buffalo, New York on November 16, 1922. He was named Anthony Raymond, but he was best known as "Tony" DeCorse, the name he used professionally. His father, Cresenzo Raymondo di Corso, immigrated to the United States from San Marco dei Cavoti, Italy. He was an artist and sign painter. The family name was changed to DeCorse after his father's service in World War I. His mother, Theresa (née Theresa George), was a homemaker. Tony DeCorse was the first of the couple's four children. He was always artistic and won prizes in school for his art. He was also musical, learning to play the guitar and piano.
In an interview regarding his service in the Merchant Marines, Tony says his father's uncle was Antoine Bourdelle, who was an artist and an assistant to François Auguste René Rodin. DeCorse started East High School, but did not graduate. Instead, he attended the Art Institute of Buffalo on Starin Avenue where he met Buffalo artists Tony Sisti, Robert Noel Blair, James J. Vullo, and William B. Rowe, whom he also modeled for. He later studied at the Clay Club (renamed the SculptureCenter in 1944) in New York City.
1944–1960 Merchant marines and early career
During the early 1940s, DeCorse worked at Bell Aircraft and Curtiss-Wright Aircraft in tool and die. He was not eligible for military service because of asthma but joined the U. S. Merchant Marines in 1944. In a 2006 interview, at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society, DeCorse says that he served as an assistant cook on two convoy ships in the North Atlantic, the George G. Meade and a Louis Bamberger lumber ship, and that he made four trips to Europe. He was discharged in 1945.
The experience in the Merchant Marines substantially influenced DeCorse's art, especially during the 1940s and 1950s. Paintings from this period, in dark colors with heavy lines featuring sailors and ships tossed on waves, are more realistic than his later works. However, this style and themes can be seen in his later sculptures in the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park and Veteran's Park. He had many exhibitions and briefly operated his own contemporary art gallery on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo in 1955. The gallery's opening show exhibited paintings by Peter Busa, Robert Wiegand, Roland Wise, and Joe Orffeo, and by DeCorse himself.
In 1947 DeCorse wrote and directed the short film, Seven Beers with Wrong Woman, collaborating with Joe Offorio. The pantomime drama is based on the 1940 folk song about true love lost by Tommy Tucker (singer). DeCorse created the papier-mâché masks worn by the characters and he also played the "Singing Waiter". Masks illustrating characters from his songs would remain a feature of DeCorse's entertaining throughout his career. During the 1940s and 50s he played in many of the Buffalo nightclubs, such as Chez Ami and Frank's Casa Nova.
Later career
Beginning in the 1960s, DeCorse's style became more abstract, which he variously described as “stylized realism” to “abstract expressionism.” His sculptures were primarily clay figures, especially busts, though he also produced some wood carvings. Starting in the 1980s and up until the time of his death, he created wooden collages and sculptures in bold colors that replicated the palette seen in his paintings of the same period. Some of his other works draw on figures from Greek and Roman mythology, and are quite fanciful including sculptures and paintings of mermaids, clowns, a purple cow Josephine, and centaurs. This fanciful bent and cubist elements also found expression in his caricatures. He widely exhibited both individually and in art shows. His 1989 exhibition "The Roaring Sixties" at the Carnegie Cultural Center featured some of his abstract paintings and sculptures from the 1960s, as well as more recent pieces.
DeCorse produced three pieces of public art. In 1988, DeCorse sculpted the commemorative plaque for Sisti Park at North and Franklin streets in Buffalo. DeCorse had known Tony Sisti, a well-known Buffalo artist, from the Art Institute. Sisti was a boxer as a young man and the memorial plaque depicts Sisti with a pair of boxing gloves. DeCorse's Rust Bucket monument honoring area members of the merchant marine who sailed on Liberty Ships during World War II was installed in Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park in 1996, and the Fathers and Sons memorial plaque in Veterans Park was dedicated in 1997. He also sketched and produced prototypes for a 40 foot long, 25 foot high, by 10 foot wide sculpture depicting the River Niagara, which he envisioned placed in the Niagara Gorge, Goat Island or the Buffalo waterfront. DeCorse said that the idea for the project first came to him in the 1930s after hearing Paul Robeson sing Ol' Man River. DeCorse's plans for the monument were never realized.
Although his first instruments were the guitar and piano, DeCorse would also perform at clubs using the lute, banjo, mandolin, harp, accordion, organetto and harpsichord. Although he wrote several songs he focused on ethnic music, which is featured in his album The Winds They Do Blow (Fiore Records 1976). He frequently incorporated masks and props into his performances, many of which echo his fanciful sculptures and caricatures. The most widely known of his papier-mâché works was the bison costume he created for the Buffalo Bills, which would charge along the sidelines during games in the 1970s.
DeCorse continued to paint, sculpt and entertain throughout his life. In his later years he was best known as an entertainer, the Traveling Troubadour, performing Italian, Irish, and American folk songs. He was a regular at Buffalo area events such as the Italian Heritage Festival.
Personal life
Tony met his long-time wife and companion, Jean M. Stewart in the 1960s at Fantasy Island, where Jean was working as a puppeteer. Through her Enchanted Theatre Puppets she performed puppet shows throughout western New York.
Awards and recognition
In 2009, DeCorse was given a key to the city and honored by Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown, who declared September 17, 2009 as Tony DeCorse Day. The executive proclamation honors DeCorse as an accomplished artist, sculptor, musical composer and strolling troubadour, and for his public art installations in Sisti Park, Veterans Park and the Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park. He is eulogized in the poem Elegy To A Man of the Arts by Sally Cook.

Aroj Ali Matubbar (; 17 December 190015 March 1985) was a self-taught philosopher and rationalist from Bangladesh.
Early life and education
He was born in the village of Charbaria Lamchari, about from Barisal town in British India, currently in Bangladesh. His original name was Aroj Ali, and he only acquired the name 'Matubbar' (meaning 'local landlord') later. He was born to a poor farming family. He studied for only a few months at the village maqtab, however this brief dabble in institutional education centered only on the Quran and other Islam studies. He gathered most of his knowledge on varied subjects, including science and philosophy, through his own readings and research.
Matubbar lost his father at an early age. When he was 12 years old, his inherited property of of land was auctioned off because, as a minor, he was unable to pay land tax. The landless boy faced an even more critical crisis when a local usurper called him out of his ancestral homestead. Destitute, Matubbar grew up somehow on the charity of others and by working as a farm laborer. Due to his poverty, he could not attend school and had to rely on the free maqtab religious education provided by a local mosque. However he did not accept the rigid methods of learning there, and left it. A benefactor helped him finish the Bengali Primers. Matubbar continued to read extensively beyond that. To satisfy his thirst for knowledge he studied all the Bengali books in Barisal Public Library. Philosophy as a subject interested him most, but there were not enough books in the collection there. A teacher of philosophy at the B M College, Kazi Ghulam Quadir, was impressed by his knowledge and comprehension, so he helped him borrow books from the college library. This was how his mind was shaped.
Philosophy
Matubbar developed a very progressive approach and wrote against ignorance, superstition, and religious fundamentalism. He came to be considered an iconoclast for writing against established religious ideologies. For example, he questioned Islamic law of inheritance, as he failed to reconcile the suggested mode of sharing of inherited property.
Aroj Ali wrote several books despite his lack of formal schooling. His writings reflect his controversial philosophy about life and the world. He also befriended a number of communist politicians and academics of Barisal town, including Professor Kazi Golam Kadir and Professor Muhammad Shamsul Haque. His books were in frequent danger of being banned by the government, since they contained certain claims that conflicted with the religious beliefs of the majority. Matubbar was arrested and taken into police custody for his book, Sotyer Shondhaney (The Quest for Truth). He was, in fact, subjected to harassment and threats throughout his life, due to his writings, as many of them challenged religious statements and claims.
Career
Due to financial constraints, Matubbar could not pursue any academic course or attain a formal institutional degree. He lived mostly on subsistence farming. Matubbar learned surveying techniques and began his life as a private land surveyor in his locality. This enabled him to accumulate some capital, and he could then own some land to start farming.
Death
He died on 15 March 1985 (1st Chaitra of the Bengali year 1392 ) in Barisal, Bangladesh. He donated his eyes for transplantation after his death. He donated his body which was received by the Anatomy Department of Sher-e-Bangla Medical College and used for dissection by the medical students. After his death in 1985, Aroj Ali Matubbar came to be regarded as one of the most prolific thinkers that rural Bangladesh ever produced, and an iconoclast who was not afraid of speaking out against entrenched beliefs and superstitions.
Writings and publications
Matubbar had to take great lengths in order to publish his books. He himself drew the cover of his first book, which was written in 1952 and published twenty one years later in 1973, under the title Satyer Sandhane. In the preface he wrote:
“I was thinking of many things, my mind was full of questions, but haphazardly. I then started jotting down questions, not for writing a book, but only to remember these questions later. Those questions were driving my mind towards an endless ocean and I was gradually drifting away from the fold of religion.”
He made six propositions in this book, which reflected the nature of his philosophical questions. These are:
Proposition 1 : dealt with the soul, containing 8 questionsProposition 2 : dealt with God, containing as many as 11 questionsProposition 3 : dealt with the after-world, containing as many as 7 questionsProposition 4 : dealt with religious matters, containing as many as 22 questionsProposition 5 : dealt with Nature, containing as many as 10 questionsProposition 6 : dealt with remaining matters, containing as many as 9 questions
The eight questions he posed in the first proposition exemplify his approach. These are (a) Who am I (self)?, (b) Is Life incorporeal or corporal ? (c) Is mind and his/soul one, and the same? (d) What is the relationship of life with the body and the mind? (e) Can we recognize or identify life? (f) Am I free? (g) Will the soul without body continue to have "knowledge" even after it leaves the body at death? and finally (h) How does life come into and go out of the body?
Books
Matubbar was considered an unusual type of writer. In Bangladesh, his writings were censored because they allegedly caused societal corruption and disharmony in the community. Following are his writings:
Shotter Shondhaney (The Quest for Truth) (1973)
Sristir Rahasya (The Mystery of Creation) (1977)
Anuman (Estimation) (1983)
Muktaman (Free Mind) (1988)
Several of his unpublished manuscripts were later published posthumously under the title of Aroj Ali Matubbar Rachanabali. Some of his writings have been translated into English and compiled in a volume published by Pathak Samabesh.
Recognition and awards
Matubbar was not well known to the elite educated society of the country during his lifetime. His first book, published in 1973, was heavy in secular thought, but caught little attention. It is only in the final years of life that he came to be known to the academic of the country. His writings were collected and published. The general public started to take an interest in his books, which, although clearly not ratified by formal training, posed a number of novel philosophical questions. He soon rose to renown, albeit after his death in 1985.

Richard Henry Hughes (born February 13, 1938) is an American retired professional baseball player who pitched in three seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). In his rookie year, 1967, he led the National League in WHIP (walks+hits per IP), and finished second to Tom Seaver in the National League Rookie of the Year voting.
Hughes was born in Stephens, Arkansas. His family moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1946. Very near-sighted, he began wearing glasses in 7th grade, and learned for the first time that there were people who could see across the street. He graduated from C. E. Byrd High School in Shreveport in 1956, and pitched for the Byrd baseball team that won the AAA state championship. He played collegiate baseball on a scholarship at the University of Arkansas for two years before beginning his professional career in 1958.
Contrary to some reports, it was Nelson Briles, not Hughes, who replaced Bob Gibson in the starting rotation for the 1967 St. Louis Cardinals when Gibson suffered a fractured leg due to a Roberto Clemente line drive. Hughes actually replaced veteran left-hander Al Jackson in the Cardinals' rotation in late May, pitching a two-hit shutout against Atlanta in his first start of the season. He went on to win 16 games that year to lead the Redbirds.
In spring training of 1968, Hughes was warming up in the bullpen when he felt pain in his throwing shoulder. Though undiagnosed at the time, the injury was later determined to be a torn rotator cuff. At the time, there was no surgery to fix such an injury. Despite the injury, Hughes was able to pitch 63.2 innings during the 1968 season, but those were the last he would throw as the injury ultimately ended his major league career.

The Siuru literary movement, named after a fire-bird in Finnic mythology, was founded in 1917 in Estonia. It was an expressionistic and neo-romantic movement that ran counter to the Young Estonia formalist tradition.
Members
Along with the founder August Gailit, the movement included the following young poets and writers: Marie Under, Henrik Visnapuu, Johannes Semper, Friedebert Tuglas, Peet Aren't, Otto Krusten, and Artur Adson.
Between 1917 and 1919, Siuru published three volumes of poetry. 1919 led to conflicts within the group. Visnapuu and Gailit left, while Johannes Barbarus and August Alle joined as new members.
Program
The members of Siuru had an affinity with futurism and Impressionism. Their poetry was often seen as scandalous due to their erotic nature. Siuru's philosophy stressed the freedom of the human spirit. Mottos of the group included Carpe diem!, and May the joy of creation be our only moving force, the latter suggested by Friedebert Tuglas. The group's symbol was white chrysanthemum.
Significance
A major result of Siuru's activities was popularisation of literature among Estonian people, leading to the active development of original Estonian literature in the young Republic of Estonia. While the movement itself was short-lived, cut short by Estonian independence and the ensuing movement of national literature, its members rose to be major figures in Estonian literature through Estonia's first period of independence and in the exile Estonian literary community during Soviet occupation.
Marie Under (1883–1980) was the leader of the movement, publishing her first book, Sonnets, in 1917. While her expressions of nature found a wide audience, her frank eroticism shocked conservatives, a motif she carried on in her subsequent works. Underwent on to a long and distinguished literary career, publishing her last book in 1963.
Artur Adson (1889–1977) published his first collection of poems, The Burning Soul, in 1917. Both this and his next collection, Old Lantern (1919), consisted of juvenile love poems. Adson went on to widely expand his genre, including dealing with social issues in a classical form. Adson wrote numerous plays. His Four Kings, a drama on the Estonian uprising of 1343, is considered his most thrilling work. He continued to write in exile, also publishing several books of memoirs, the last in 1953. Adson was Marie Under's second husband.

Rancho Butano was a Mexican land grant in present-day San Mateo County, California given in 1838 by Governor Juan Alvarado and confirmed in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Ramona Sanchez. The name Butano can be traced back to 1816. It speculated that Californios called a drinking cup made from the horn of a bull or other animal a butano. A First American origin is possible but has not been established. At one time, the grant was in Santa Cruz County 1850–1868; a boundary adjustment transferred the land to San Mateo County. The grant extended along the Pacific coast between Rancho Pescadero and Rancho Punta del Año Nuevo, with Butano Creek on the north to Arroyo de los Frijoles (Creek of the Beans) on the south, and encompassed present-day Bean Hollow State Beach and Butano State Park.
History
Under Mexican rule, substantial changes in California society began, including the dismantling of the mission properties and expansion of colonists into California's former mission landholdings. Settlers petitioned for land grants, and between the years of 1834 and 1836 alone the Mexican Congress released a million acres of mission lands to private ownership. Without the authority of the missions, the Indians lost any potential claim to their lands. The Former Mission cattle ranches at Pescadero and Año Nuevo were ultimately divided into three separate Mexican Period land grants deeded to Mexican citizens. These new land divisions included Rancho San Antonio- or Pescadero, Rancho Punta del Año Nuevo, and Rancho Butano.
Juan Venancio Galindo married María Ramona Lorenza Sanchez in 1795. Their son, José Antonio Galindo, was granted the Rancho Laguna de la Merced and Rancho Saucelito in 1835. The one square league Butano Rancho was granted to Ramona Sanchez, widow of Venancio Galindo, in 1838, this was the first grant issued by Governor Juan Alvarado, and re-granted to the same grantee, by Governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1844. In 1852, Ramona Sanchez sold the Rancho Butano to Manuel Rodriguez.
With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Butano was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853. Rodríguez won a dispute about the northern boundary with Rancho Pescadero in 1863, and the grant was patented to Manuel Rodríguez in 1866.
Rancho Butano was sold in 1862 to Clark & Coburn of San Francisco. Loren Coburn, born in Vermont, came to California in 1851, and worked first in mining. Loren Coburn bought out his brother-in-law Jeremiah Clark. Coburn subsequently bought Rancho Punta del Año Nuevo directly to the south. He was an extremely aggressive landowner, contesting boundaries, and a perpetual litigant in the courts, and was widely disliked. In the 1890s, Coburn erected a large hotel on the bluff above Pebble Beach, hoping to make it a popular destination for vacationers taking the planned Ocean Shore Railroad from San Francisco. Pescadero Marsh remained an un-important feature to Mr. Coburn, and at that time there were no formal roads through it, although cattle grazed freely throughout the marsh as it remained unfenced.
The San Francisco earthquake in 1906 ended construction on the railroad, and the hotel permanently closed. Coburn leased much of the land to a dairy enterprise run by the Steele family (Rensselaer, Isaac and Edgar) from Delaware. Coburn and Clark's legacy of defending their land slowed the subdivision and development of Rancho Butano. Ultimately, Loren Coburn passed away on November 14, 1918 at the age of ninety-two. By 1920, Coburn's landholdings near Pescadero were subdivided into small farms by the Peninsula Farms Company, which had acquired property rights from one of Coburn's Trustees, Mr. Christopher Wideman (Morrall 1992:214). Similarly, Butano Farms became an agricultural pursuit.

The SBX World Cup Montafon is part of the world championship organised by the FIS for Snowboarding. The World Cup takes place annually in the Montafon in Vorarlberg (Austria).
The competitions are held at the Hochjoch in Schruns in the Silvretta Montafon ski area. The following disciplines have been carried out in the Montafon so far: snowboard cross (SBX) and parallel slalom (PSL). The snowboard cross route is 980 meters long and the parallel slalom route is 280 meters long.
History
Snowboarding was added to the FIS competition program in May 1994, the first Snowboard World Championship was held in 1996.
In the 2010/11 season, the Snowboard Cross World Cup was held once in Lech am Arlberg. Then they looked up a region in Vorarlberg for a suitable place to present the snowboard cross optimally. The Montafon turned out to be suitable for this. The first Snowboard Cross World Cup took place in December 2012.
In December 2014, the snowboard cross had to be cancelled due to warm temperatures. Instead, a parallel slalom and mixed team competition were held. Due to the warm temperatures, snow production was impossible for the track in 2018, so that year, the snowboard cross had to be cancelled.
In the season 2020/21, due to policies regarding COVID-19, all races in the Montafon (FIS Ski Cross Weltcup, FIS Snowboard Cross World Cup) had to be postponed to 15 and 16 January 2021, and later be cancelled completely.

Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain () is a Marxist–Leninist communist party in Spain. PCPE was founded out of the unification of several Marxist-Leninist factions. The youth organization is called the Communist Youth of the Peoples of Spain.
History
From 13–15 December 1984 a "Communist Unity Congress" was held in Madrid. Partido Comunista de España Unificado (PCEU, Unified Communist Party of Spain), Movimiento de Recuperación del PCE (MRPCE, Movement for the Recuperation of the PCE), Movimiento para la Recuperación y Unificación del PCE (MRUPCE, Movement for the Recuperation and Unification of the PCE), Candidatura Comunista (CC, Communist Candidature), and some minor groups unified themselves, thus creating Partido Comunista (renamed PCPE in 1986).
All these groups had surged from splits from the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) during the 1970s and 1980s. Quickly after its foundation, PCPE was recognized by some other parties, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other statebearing Eastern bloc parties. The party was formed by those who were against Santiago Carrillo's Eurocommunist line in the PCE. The Catalan referent of PCPE was initially Party of Communists of Catalonia (PCC), but it later broke with PCPE and now the Catalan referent is the Communist Party of the Peoples of Catalonia.
PCPE briefly joined Izquierda Unida in 1987. In 2000, the Spanish Communist Workers' Party (PCOE) merged with PCPE, and the publication of the united party became Unidad y Lucha.
In 2021 the PCPE is forming a coalition with the reconstituted Spanish Communist Workers' Party (PCOE) for the Madrid regional election as the Coalition for Communist Unity.
2017 Split
In April 2017 the PCPE suffered a major split. During the fifth plenary session of the central committee a minority of the committee recognized Ástor García as the new secretary general of the party, however a majority continued to recognize the incumbent (since 2002) secretary general Carmelo Suárez. The group around Ástor García created a new competing website of the PCPE.
Both PCPE-Suárez and PCPE-García were recognized by different communist parties as the legitimate PCPE. A majority of the Collectives of Communist Youth membership pledged allegiance to PCPE-García.
For the next two years both groups would compete for the PCPE name and international recognition. This dispute was finally resolved in March 2019 when the PCPE-García relinquished its claim to the PCPE name and renamed itself to the Communist Party of the Workers of Spain (Partido Comunista de los Trabajadores de España, PCTE).
Publications
PCPE publishes Unidad y Lucha and Propuesta Comunista (a theoretical journal). Before the PCOE-PCPE merger, the main publication of the party was Nuevo Rumbo.

The All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union (, Jichiro) is a trade union representing local government workers in Japan.
The union was established in January 1954, with the merger of two smaller unions of local government workers. It was affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and grew rapidly, attaining 559,397 members by 1967. By 1987, it was the largest union in the country, with 1,257,000 members. In 1989, it became affiliated with the Japanese Trade Union Confederation. Members who objected to this affiliation left and formed the rival Japan Federation of Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Unions.
The union absorbed the National Union of General Workers in 2006 and the Japan Municipal Transport Workers' Union in 2013. Despite this, by 2020, its membership had declined to 785,445, though it was still Japan's second-largest union.

Risk is a 2016 American documentary film written and directed by Laura Poitras about the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. It was screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. On April 9, 2017, Showtime released a trailer for the film, executive produced by Sam Esmail and set to be released in the "summer".
Overview
The film's original premise was to address the life of Julian Assange, documenting scenes showing "motives and contradictions of Assange and his inner circle", focusing on the risks taken by persons involved in the well-known Wikileaks website, including Assange. The documentary begins in 2010, addressing the judicial measures he came to face on the part of the Swedish authorities, which sought his extradition from the U.K. in 2012. Assange alleges that any such Swedish extradition would have culminated in an eventual extradition to the United States. The opening scene shows Assange (with Wikileaks staffer Sarah Harrison) calling the U.S. State Department, asking them to step-up security procedures. This segues into a presentation of Assange's angst about the fate of Chelsea Manning and Assange's plans to avoid U.S. capture. The film then presents documentation of Assange's asylum claim, and the disguising of himself to sneak into the Embassy of Ecuador in London for refuge.
Originally titled "Asylum", the film becomes a journey into Poitras's disillusionment with Assange. In the re-cut of the film, she altered the film's focus on the experience of risk-taking media work (Assange's as well as her own), towards a critique of Assange as a flawed character, including his alleged sexual assaults and "troubling" statements about women.
In the 2016 version of the film, Poitras presents a more sympathetic position towards Assange. The 2017 re-cut version focuses more on Assange's responses to accusations against him.
In mid-2016, directly after the Cannes screening, Assange friend and Wikileaks supporter Jacob Appelbaum was publicly accused of abusing women while working with Wikileaks and serving as a computer security activist at Tor. At one point in the film Poitras states in a voice-over her personal disappointment with Appelbaum, and her anger at Appelbaum's alleged abuse of one of her friends. In interviews, she stated that Julian Assange frantically attempted to get her to remove scenes in which he refers to the sexual assault allegations against him as a "radical feminist conspiracy" by lesbians, and that his lawyers contacted her directly before Cannes. Poitras said that Assange sent her an SMS message calling the scenes a "threat to his freedom". According to Poitras, this was what led her to refocus on the same accusations, to add the Appelbaum story to the film, and to change the overall message of the film.
The film touches briefly on the role played by Wikileaks in the 2016 U.S. election.

Reception
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes collected 94 reviews with an average rating of 7/10 , of which 82% were positive. The website's critical consensus states: "Risk poses knotty questions regarding documentary filmmaking ethics, but remains consistently compelling despite its flaws." Metacritic gave the film a score of 72 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Some reviewers highlighted Poitras' personal entanglement in the story, for her affair with Appelbaum.
The film drew only $145,000 in box office remittances, a sharp drop from the $3 million earned by Citizenfour, Poitras' documentary about Edward Snowden.

Mary Davidson Earle ( Cameron; 20 October 1929 – 18 April 2021) was a Scottish-born New Zealand food technologist. She was the first female faculty member of a university engineering department in New Zealand when she joined Massey University's food technology department in 1965.
Early life
Earle was born Mary Davidson Cameron on 20 October 1929 in Banavie near Ben Nevis in Scotland, the daughter of Ronald Cameron. She studied chemical engineering at the University of Glasgow, and completed her PhD in food science there in 1957. The title of her doctoral thesis was The purification of soya lipoxidase. She then worked in product development in the British food industry for five years.
While studying at Glasgow, she met her husband, Richard Lawrence Earle, who was also undertaking doctoral studies there, and the couple married in 1961.
Career in New Zealand
After moving to New Zealand in 1961, Mary Earle began work at New Zealand's Meat Industry Research Institute. She joined the staff of Massey University Food Technology Department in 1965, becoming the first female engineering academic in New Zealand. Her early work was adding rigour to the university's graduate course in food technology, which had been established the year before she joined Massey. In time she would develop the Food Technology Research Centre, which made the university's resources available to industry.
In 1992, Earle became a full professor when she was awarded a personal chair by Massey University, the first in the university's technology faculty. She was the fourth female professor at Massey. She retired from Massey in 1994, and was accorded the title of professor emerita.
Earle served on the board of the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research, and was a director of the Pork Industry Board.
Later life and death
In retirement, Mary and Dick Earle wrote eight books together, including Creating New Foods: The Product Developer's Guide in 2009. They established scholarship and grant programmes to support students, particularly women, in engineering and technology, and founded the Earle Creativity and Development Trust to develop and nuture science and technology, the visual and fine arts, literature and history, and music in the Manawatū and Rangitīkei regions.
Mary Earle died in Palmerston North on 18 April 2021, and she chose to be buried in Turakina where some of the earliest Scottish immigrants to New Zealand had lived. She had been a president of the Clan Cameron Association of New Zealand whose members celebrate their Scottish roots.
Honours and awards
In 1992, Earle was elected an honorary fellow of the New Zealand Institution of Engineers. In the 1993 Queen's Birthday Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to food technology, and the same year she was one of 544 recipients of the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.
In 2018, Earle was conferred with an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Massey University. She also received an honorary doctorate from Khon Kaen University in Thailand, and was an honorary fellow of the Institute of Food Science & Technology.

In computer science a palindrome tree, also called an EerTree, is a type of search tree, that allows for fast access to all palindromes contained in a string. They can be used to solve the longest palindromic substring, the k-factorization problem<ref name="kfactor">{{cite journal |last1=Galil |first1=Zvi |last2=Seiferas |first2=Joel |title=A Linear-Time On-Line Recognition Algorithm for ``Palstar |journal=Journal of the ACM |date=1978 |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=102–111 |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322047.322056}}</ref> (can a given string be divided into exactly k'' palindromes), palindromic length of a string (what is the minimum number of palindromes needed to construct the string), and finding and counting all distinct sub-palindromes. Palindrome trees do this in an online manner, that is it does not require the entire string at the start and can be added to character by character.
Description
Like most trees, a palindrome tree consists of vertices and directed edges. Each vertex in the tree represents a palindrome (e.g. 'tacocat') but only stores the length of the palindrome, and each edge represents either a character or a suffix. The character edges represent that when the character is appended to both ends of the palindrome represented by the source vertex, the palindrome in the destination vertex is created (e.g. an edge labeled 't' would connect the source vertex 'acoca' to the destination vertex 'tacocat'). The suffix edge connects each palindrome to the largest palindrome suffix it possesses (in the previous example 'tacocat' would have a suffix edge to 't', and 'atacocata' would have a suffix link to 'ata'). Where palindrome trees differ from regular trees, is that they have two roots (as they are in fact two separate trees). The two roots represent palindromes of length −1, and 0. That is, if the character 'a' is appended to both roots the tree will produce 'a' and 'aa' respectively. Since each edge adds (or removes) an even number of characters, the two trees are only ever connected by suffix edges.
Operations
Add
Since a palindrome tree follows an online construction, it maintains a pointer to the last palindrome added to the tree. To add the next character to the palindrome tree, add(x) first checks if the first character before the palindrome matches the character being added, if it does not, the suffix links are followed until a palindrome can be added to the tree. Once a palindrome has been found, if it already existed in the tree, there is no work to do. Otherwise, a new vertex is added with a link from the suffix to the new vertex, and a suffix link for the new vertex is added. If the length of the new palindrome is 1, the suffix link points to the root of the palindrome tree that represents a length of −1.
# S -> Input String
# x -> position in the string of the character being added
def add(x: int) -> bool:
"""Add character to the palindrome tree."""
while True:
if x - 1 - current.length >= 0 and S[x - 1 - current.length] == S[x]:
break
current = current.suffix
if current.add[S[x]] is not None:
return False
suffix = current
current = Palindrome_Vertex()
current.length = suffix.length + 2
suffix.add[S[x]] = current
if current.length == 1:
current.suffix = root
return True
while True:
suffix = suffix.suffix
if x - 1 - suffix.length >= 0 and S[x - 1 - suffix.length] == S[x]:
current.suffix = suffix.add[S[x]]
return True
Joint trees
Finding palindromes that are common to multiple strings or unique to a single string can be done with additional space where is the number of strings being compared. This is accomplished by adding an array of length to each vertex, and setting the flag to 1 at index if that vertex was reached when adding string . The only other modification needed is to reset the current pointer to the root at the end of each string. By joining trees in such a manner the following problems can be solved:
Number of palindromes common to all strings
Number of unique palindromes in a string
Longest palindrome common to all strings
The number of palindromes that occur more often in one string than others
Complexity
Time
Constructing a palindrome tree takes time, where is the length of the string and is the size of the alphabet. With calls to add(x), each call takes amortized time. This is a result of each call to add(x) increases the depth of the current vertex (the last palindrome in the tree) by at most one, and searching all possible character edges of a vertex takes time. By assigning the cost of moving up and down the tree to each call to add(x), the cost of moving up the tree more than once is 'paid for' by an equal number of calls to add(x) when moving up the tree did not occur.
Space
A palindrome tree takes space: At most vertices to store the sub-palindromes and two roots, edges, linking the vertices and suffix edges.
Space–time tradeoff
If instead of storing only the add edges that exist for each palindrome an array of length edges is stored, finding the correct edge can be done in constant time reducing construction time to while increasing space to , where is the number of palindromes.

Taillevent is a restaurant in Paris, founded in 1946 by André Vrinat, and now owned by the Gardinier family.
Origin
The restaurant was named in a tribute to Guillaume Tirel, called Taillevent, a cook in the 14th century known to have written the first cuisine book in French, Le Viandier, ordered by Charles V of France.
History
In 1946 Taillevent restaurant was founded by André Vrinat in a dining room of the Worms, located at Saint-Georges street, 9th arrondissement of Paris; the chef was then Paul Cosnier.
In 1948, it won its first star given by the French restaurant guide Guide Michelin. In 1950, the restaurant moved to the mansion of the Duc de Morny, built in 1852, which was a family house before becoming the embassy of Paraguay. Today the restaurant is located at 15, Lamennais Street, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.
In 1954 Taillevent restaurant received its second star under the chef Lucien Leheu. Jean-Claude Vrinat, son of the founder and a graduate of HEC Paris, began working there in 1962. In 1973, Guide Michelin awarded three stars to Taillevent restaurant, under the direction of the chef Claude Deligne.
Its pastry chefs have included Philippe Feret from Brasserie Julien.
The chef Philippe Legendre began working at Taillevent in 1991.
Since 1984, Taillevent has been a recipient of the Wine Spectator Grand Award.
Diversification
In 1987, Taillevent opened a wine shop, Les Caves Taillevent, at 199 Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris. This wine shop was under the direction of Valérine Vrinat, who began to work for Taillevent the same year. It has since been moved to n° 228 in the same street.
In 2001, Taillevent's owners opened another restaurant, L'Angle du Faubourg, located at 195 Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Michel del Burgo left Taillevent's kitchens to lead L'Angle du Faubourg, and was replaced by head chef Alain Solivérès. Alain Lecomte became head pastry cook. This restaurant has since been renamed Les 110 de Taillevent.
In 2004, Jean-Claude Vrinat decorated the restaurant with contemporary art, and in 2005 Les Caves Taillevent opened a second wine shop at Marunouchi, Tokyo in Japan.
In June 2006 Jean-Claude Vrinat launched a blog in order to share his art-of-cooking experiences. The same year, a third wine shop, Les Caves Taillevent, opened in Printemps Haussmann, Paris.
In 2013, Les Caves de Taillevent opened its first Middle Eastern branch in Beirut, Lebanon, in Les Jardins de Tabaris.
After Alain Lecomte left Taillevent, Arnaud Vodounou became the new head pastry cook.
Troubles
On 21 February 2007, Jean-Claude Vrinat announced on his blog the loss of the third star, which was also referred to in the International Herald Tribune newspaper. Vrinat died of lung cancer on 7 January 2008. He was 71 years old.

Minot International Airport is in Ward County, North Dakota, United States, two miles north of the city of Minot, which owns it. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport.
MOT currently handles between ten and fifteen commercial flights a day from three airlines, as well as various charters and general aviation traffic. For many years Northwest Airlines, followed by Delta Air Lines, was the airport's sole commercial carrier but an economic and population boom have resulted in other carriers adding flights as well. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Allegiant Airlines currently offer flights to Minneapolis, Denver, Phoenix/Mesa, and Las Vegas, respectively.
Minot International has no scheduled passenger airline service out of the country, but receives its international title (like many other airports) because of its customs service. Customs service is available for aircraft arriving from Canada and other countries. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) fully searches all passengers and carry-on luggage prior to boarding, rather than using a selective process as is the case at major airports.
Delta Air Lines operates up to six daily flights to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. All are on Delta Connection to Minneapolis. Delta Air Lines commands the largest percentage of MOT travelers.
United Airlines became Minot's second largest airline in 2010. It currently operates four daily flights to Denver International Airport. United also flies multiple weekly charters to Houston, Texas.
Allegiant Airlines became the airport's third airline in 2010, with flights to Las Vegas, then added service to Phoenix-Mesa. The number of flights to each destination fluctuates.
Frontier Airlines became the airport's fourth airline in 2012 with four flights per week to Denver International Airport. Though passenger loads were high, Frontier discontinued service from Minot in 2015 due to restructuring of The original Frontier Airlines served Minot on a route that connected it with Saskatoon, Regina, and Denver; bankruptcy halted that airline's operations in 1986.
Facilities
The airport covers at an elevation of above sea level. It has two runways: 13/31 is feet concrete and 8/26 is asphalt. Its longest runway can receive Boeing 747s.
In the year ending June 30, 2012, the airport had 49,156 aircraft operations, average 134 per day: 62% general aviation, 14% airline, 13% military, and 10% air taxi. 127 aircraft were then based at this airport: 92% single-engine, 5% multi-engine, 2% jet, and 1% helicopter.
In 2013, aircraft operations dropped to 32,023 for the fiscal year. Itinerant general aviation operations is still the highest percentage of operations with 10,429. Air carrier is at 6,825 and air taxi is at 5,201. Finally, for itinerant operations, military made up 283. Local operations include 6,898 civil and 2,387 military operations. Based aircraft has dropped to 112 housed aircraft.
Avflight is the fixed-base operator at the airport, offering a 24 hour fueling station for quick turns and efficient technology stops. Other services include catering, Customs, international garbage disposal, and rental cars.
Minot Aero Center is a maintenance business at the airport, offering flight training, maintenance and general aircraft services.
Historical airline service
Braniff Airways started service in 1952 with one daily departure south to Bismarck with DC-3 equipment. The original Frontier Airlines started new service on May 1, 1959, with three daily departures to Bismarck on 26 passenger DC-3s. North Central Airlines had four daily departures in July 1960 on DC-3 equipment; the service went to Bismarck and Devils Lake, east of Minot.
Airlines and destinations
Passenger
Allegiant Air uses Airbus A319-100s and Airbus A320-200s to Las Vegas and Phoenix. Delta Connection uses Bombardier CRJ200s and Bombardier CRJ900s operated by SkyWest Airlines to Minneapolis. United Express uses Bombardier CRJ200s operated by SkyWest Airlines and Embraer ERJ145s operated by Trans States Airlines to Denver.
Statistics
Growth and future
Minot's growth in population and economy, along with the enormous influx of workers and residents due to the Bakken oil boom in western North Dakota, have increased air passenger numbers tremendously. Though Minot is the fourth largest city in North Dakota, the airport is now the third-busiest. While the airport is only twenty years old, it was designed for roughly 100,000 passengers. This has strained airport infrastructure and resulted in makeshift changes such as temporary long term parking, additional hold-room areas, and other similar measures.
Minot's current situation and forecasted growth over the next twenty years warranted a study to identify alternatives to deal with that growth. Ultimately it was decided that the best option was a new terminal to be built directly east of the former terminal, which opened in the late 1980s. Design of the new terminal building was completed in May 2013, and included four to six gates, room for up to four car rental companies, additional restaurant space, additional check in areas for future new airlines, and greatly expanded parking facilities for short term, long term, and rental car parking.
Growing passenger numbers, parking issues, and the possibilities of new airlines and destinations made a new terminal at Minot International Airport a top priority. The projected $40 million terminal joined a list of other major improvements over the next three years which include additional apron, a new taxiway, a new Snow Removal Equipment building, additional parking and a new access road, with total investment around $98 million to cope with increased traffic.
The new terminal, four times the size of its predecessor, opened on
The old terminal building was demolished in November 2016, after the city of Minot voted to demolish the structure after the new terminal was completed. There is no definite plan for the area after the demolition, but the city is considering a car rental facility as a frontrunner to be built in the old terminal's place.
Ground Transportation
Minot City Transit buses do not directly serve the terminal, however, buses do travel along 3rd Street Northeast and Airport Road, where passengers may flag down any bus at an intersection.

The Leichhardt Highway is a major transport route in Queensland, Australia. It is a continuation northward from Goondiwindi of the Newell Highway, via a section of the Cunningham Highway.
It runs northward from Goondiwindi for more than 600 kilometres until its termination at the Capricorn Highway near the small town of Westwood.
The highway is a state-controlled strategic road, except for the section concurrent with the Gore Highway, which is a state-controlled part of the National Network.
History
It is named after Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt who travelled a route in the 19th Century that roughly parallels today's highway.
Upgrade
A project to replace the Banana Creek bridge, at a cost of $7.7 million, was completed in April 2022.

Constantijn Francken or Konstantijn Francken (Baptised on 5 April 1661, Antwerp – 1717, Antwerp), was a Flemish Baroque painter and the final painter in the long line of the Francken family of artists. He is mainly known for his battle scenes. He worked for a long time in Paris where he was a court painter to the King and mainly painted portraits.
Life
Francken was born in Antwerp as the son of Hieronymous Francken III and Cornelia Daep. He was baptised on 5 April 1661. He was the final artist in the Francken family of artists, which had played an important role in Flemish paintings since the second half of the 16th century and whose large workshop was a standard of quality artistic production in Antwerp. Constantijn's father Hieronymous was the son of Frans Francken the Younger, the most famous scion of the Francken dynasty. There are several attributions of work to Hieronymous but none authenticated. Hieronymous died in 1671 and cannot have played a major role in the artistic training of his son. It is unknown who his teacher was but it is possible that Constantijn was trained in the Francken family workshop.
It is believed that at an early age he went to Paris where he may have been active between 1679 and 1694. During his period in Paris he may have produced work for the French king Louis XIV. Evidence of his residence in Paris is a declaration made on 2 May 1699 in Antwerp by the engraver Cornelis Vermeulen and others about Constantijn Francken's successful activities in Paris. Upon his return to Antwerp he declared in a submission to the Antwerp Magistrate dated 10 December 1694 that he had been active for 15 years in Paris, Versailles and other residences of the king of France where he had been painting portraits that gained him an excellent reputation. He further stated that he was ready to establish himself in Antwerp if he were relieved from the obligation to provide city services. He obtained a relief of military service on 24 January 1695.
In the guild year 1694-1695 he joined the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke as a 'wijnmeester', i.e. the son of a master.
In the guild year 1695-1696 he was dean of the guild but was exempted from active duties as a dean by a payment of 300 Guilders and some guns to the guild. He took on Karel van Falens as his pupil in the same year. Van Falens later specialised in hunting and hawking scenes and worked for the king of France.
On 28 April 1696 Francken married Christina Clara who was originally from Boechout. His wife later developed a mental illness and was said to have run away from home naked. His wife's family accused Francken of having caused his wife's illness by squandering her inheritance. The dispute between the two families became quite heated and Constantijn was ordered by penalty of physical punishment to desist from insulting his brother-in-law. It appears that he spent above his means although he was successful as an artist and his works fetched high prices. He sold in 1703 a large painting of the Battle of Ekeren of 1703 (now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) to the city of Antwerp for 280 Guilders.
He died debt-laden on 12 January 1717 in Antwerp in a house he was renting in de Lange Nieuwstraat. He was buried on the same day in the St. James' Church.
Work
While Francken seems to have worked mainly as a portrait painter during his 15-year residence in France, there are no known portraits by his hand. He is now only known for landscapes depicting military episodes. In addition to the Battle of Ekeren, he painted a canvas showing Maarten van Rossum's departure after his attack on Antwerp on 24 July 1542 (Museum aan de Stroom, Antwerp), The siege of Namur by William III of Orange (unknown location), the Presentation of the keys of Strasbourg to Louis XIV (Musée historique de Strasbourg) and an unlocated bird's eye view of a battle painted in 1702.
He was very skilled at placing the various actors in the military scenes in lively positions.

Jorge "Papito" Serguera (c. 1932–2009) was a Rebel Commander and the president of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television from 1967 to 1974.
At one point Serguera banned songs from The Beatles from airing on Cuban radio stations. At a later point he admitted that he liked listening to the music in private. In a 2001 exclusive interview with Cuban author Ernesto Juan Castellanos, published in the book John Lennon in Havana with a little help from my friends, Serguera said that he was following orders from other officials who viewed the music as a threat to "the Revolution."

Nimis (from the latin, "too much") is a site-specific artwork by Lars Vilks located at Håle stenar in the north western region of Skåne. The artwork mostly consists of wooden constructions erected of driftwood, planks and branches. The work is illegally placed in Kullaberg, which has led to an ongoing legal process between the artist and the Skåne County administrative board. Parts of the artwork have been set on fire on different occasions, and it was rebuilt after a fire in 2016 by Ladonias art and jumping-minister Fredrik Larsson. Which led to a fine being issued in 2018 by a district court.
Vilks viewed Nimis as a conceptual piece of art and the legal issues were hence a part of the concept. Since 1986 the artwork has been owned by the artist couple Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Vilks also claimed that the artwork was placed in the microstate Ladonia. In the same area is also another one of Vilks artwork located, Arx.
History
Background
Nimis was built by driftwood and is made of sparingly nailed together boards and branches which forms pathways, rooms and towers. The construction of Nimis began in July 1980 as Vilks "revenge to the ocean" after having been close to drowning. But also as a comment to the current trend in art where "nothing lasted".
Development
The authorities did not know that Nimis existed until 1982. When they got aware of the situation they tried to go forward with demolishing it due to its unlawful construction. This led to a long legal process which Vilks introduced into his artistic practice and regarded as a piece of the artwork. The physical work grew, and spanned over 100 meters, while some of the towers were above 15 meters tall.
Nimis has been updated under the decades and over 160.000 nails has been used during these years.
In 1984 Nimis was sold to the German artist Joseph Beuys, and after his death it was sold to the artist couple Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1986.
Fire in 2016, verdict in 2018
The whole Vindarnas torn, which was approximately 25 percent of the artwork, burned down on 24 November 2016. Other parts of the artwork were also damaged. After that Vilks started a mission to secure the artwork and rebuild it, but in another shape. Due to this Vilks was sentenced by the Skåne County administrative board to pay a fine in 2018. Which he aimed to dispute.

Brigitte McMahon-Huber (born 25 March 1967 in Baar) is an athlete from Switzerland, who competed in triathlon.
McMahon competed at the first Olympic triathlon at the 2000 Summer Olympics. She won the gold medal with a total time of 2:00:40.52, which until 2008 was the fastest time for a female in an Olympic triathlon. Her split times were 19:44.58 for the swim, 1:05:42.30 for the cycling and 0:35:13.64 for the run.
McMahon-Huber competed at the second Olympic triathlon at the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing tenth with a total time of 2:07:07.73.
McMahon tested positive for erythropoietin (EPO) during an out of competition control in June 2005. She maintains that she did not take any doping until well after the 2004 Athens Olympics where she came 10th and that she did it for therapeutic reasons only. After the positive test she was immediately removed from the Swiss national team and was facing a two-year ban from triathlon. As a consequence she retired from the sport.

The ISS year-long mission was an 11-month-long scientific research project aboard the International Space Station, which studied the health effects of long-term spaceflight. Astronaut Scott Kelly (ideally suited for the experiment as the identical twin of Mark Kelly) and Cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko spent 340 days in space, with scientists performing medical experiments. Kelly and Kornienko launched on 27 March 2015 on Soyuz TMA-16M along with Gennady Padalka. The mission encompassed Expeditions 43, 44, 45 and 46. The pair safely landed in Kazakhstan on March 2, 2016, returning aboard Soyuz TMA-18M with Sergey Volkov. The mission supported the NASA Twins study, which helps shed light on the health effects of long-duration spaceflight, which is of interest for Mars missions especially.
On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results from the NASA Twins Study which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including those related to alterations in DNA and cognition, when one twin was compared with the other.
Selection
In November 2012, NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), and their international partners selected two veteran spacefarers for a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station in 2015. The mission included collecting scientific data important to future human exploration of the Solar System. Kelly and Korniyenko already had an indirect connection: Kelly was a backup crew member for the station's Expedition 23/24 crews, where Korniyenko served as a flight engineer.
The goal aboard the orbiting laboratory was to understand better how the human body reacts and adapts to the harsh environment of space. Data from the mission was used to improve assessments of crew performance and health. They worked to develop and validate better countermeasures against the risks associated with future missions around the Moon, asteroids and ultimately Mars.
Results
On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results, from the NASA Twins study, which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including those related to alterations in DNA and cognition, when one twin was compared with the other.
The study also required the astronauts to keep a journal, and investigated the psychological effects of living in a confined space for an extended length of time. Kornienko said of his experiences on Expedition 23/24: "The thing you miss there most of all is the Earth itself, I missed smells. I missed trees, I even dreamt of them. I even hallucinated. I thought I smelled a real fire and something being barbecued on it! I ended up putting pictures of trees on the walls to cheer up. You do miss the Earth there."
Scott stated that he missed feeling changes in the weather while on the ISS.
NASA Twin Study
Identical twins Mark Kelly and Scott Kelly were studied for changes in the health of a body in space compared to a body on earth.
Effect of spaceflight on the human body
The International Space Station developed exercise equipment, including treadmills and resistance devices to limit muscle atrophy in a low gravity environment. Weightlessness causes body fluids in astronauts to accumulate in the upper half of the body, leading to facial edema and unwelcome side effects. One problem may be the low gravity affecting the body in unforeseen ways and it can be hard to detect the cause and effect of gravity on the body. Space seems to cause trouble for a number of body parts including bone, sometimes the eyes, and a classic problem is space sickness.
Longest time spent in space by other astronauts
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov spent 365 days in space on Mir from December 1987 to December 1988.
Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days on Mir in 1994-1995 and Sergei Avdeyev spent 379 days on Mir in 1998-1999.
Prior to the Year-Long Mission, the longest mission on the ISS was 215 days, by Mikhail Tyurin and Michael López-Alegría. Christina Hammock Koch holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman at around 328 days. In March 2022, NASA's Mark T. Vande Hei landed following 355 days in space as part of ISS Expeditions 64/65/66.

Goče (, ) is a village in the hills southwest of Vipava in the traditional Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It is now generally regarded as part of the Slovenian Littoral. It includes the hamlets of Bešenca, Na Grofovem, Na Jagni, Pod Strmcem, and V Gasah.
Name
The name Goče is derived from the personal name *Gotъ. Other Slovenian toponyms presumably based on this name are Gotenica, Gotna vas (a suburb of Novo Mesto), Gotovlje, and Gotenc. Locally, the name is pronounced Γûəče , with the adjective form γûški and demonym Γučân .
History
Goče was very wealthy in the past; this is indicated in part by houses with dates from the 17th and 18th centuries carved into their door casings. Near Saint Andrew's Church some of the old buildings are built so close together that the streets are barely 1 m wide. Oral tradition states that the houses were built so compactly because the land belonged to the church, exempting the residents from military service.
Churches
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Andrew and dates from 1630. It belongs to the Koper Diocese. A small church built on a hill above the village also belongs to this parish and is dedicated to Our Lady of the Snow. The bell tower contains a bell cast in Goče in 1706.
The village cemetery is south of the settlement. It has chapel dating from 1687 that is a prime example of the Karst Renaissance style. Between the church and the cemetery there is an altar-like wayside shrine from the end of the 17th century. Its relief carvings are heavily damaged.
Notable people
Notable people that were born or lived in Goče include:
Franc Ferjančič (1867–1943), writer
Alfonz Furlan (1856–1932), local historian and religious writer
Ivan Mercina (1851–1940), campanologist and composer

Oxygonioceras is a genus in the Oncocerid family, Brevicoceratidae, from the Middle Silurian of North America and Europe.
Oxygonioceras, named by Foeste, 1925, has a loosely coiled, dextrally torticonic shell with a rounded dorsum on the inside of the spiral and an angular or subangular venter on the outside; suture with broad lateral lobes and ventral siphuncle with expanded, nummuloidal segments.
Although also torticonically gyroconic—having an out of plane open spiral - Oxygonioceras differs from Naedyceras and closely related genera in that the siphuncle segments are empty, rather than being actinosiphonate.

Vincenzo Cabianca (June 21, 1827, Verona – March 21, 1902, Rome) was an Italian painter of the Macchiaioli group.
Biography
He was born in Verona in modest circumstances. He began his artistic training at the Verona Academy under Giovanni Caliari, and then studied at the Venice Academy from 1845 to 1847. An admirer of Giuseppe Mazzini, he became associated with the Young Italy movement and was taken prisoner while participating in the defense of Bologna in 1848. After his release he lived in Venice from 1849 until 1853.
During the 1850s Cabianca became acquainted with the artists, including Adriano Cecioni, Cristiano Banti, and Telemaco Signorini, who frequented the Caffè Michelangiolo in Florence, who would be known as the Macchiaioli. He became a friend of Signorini, and travelled with Signorini and Banti to Paris. His friend's influence led Cabianca to turn away from genre paintings towards a bolder realism, beginning in 1858. Like the other Macchiaioli, he painted landscapes en plein air, but he was more reluctant than his friends were to abandon historical and literary subjects.
Cabianca emphasized powerful value contrasts in his paintings. Cecioni described him as "the most declared, violent and uninhibited macchiaiolo." Angelo de Gubernatis, who termed the Macchiaioli "enemies of all conventionalism and accurate researchers of effects", described Cabianca as principally interested in the effects of sunlight. Gottardo Garollo in his Dizionario Biografico describes Cabianca as a painter of the "effects of the Sun".
Many of his paintings depict nuns; a well-known example is Le monachine (The nuns; 1861–62, Turin exhibition). Other works of the 1860s include La Mandriana and il Porcile al sole (1860). Returning from travels to Tuscany and Paris in 1864, he domiciled in Parma from 1864 to 1868, then moved to Rome.
Among his other works are Il bagno fra gli scogli; Sant'Angelo all' Isola di Giudecca; Reminiscenze del mare; Gondola bruna; La neve in Ciociaria; Le mura del convento; and Sotto il portico dei barattieri a Venice. At Naples in 1877, he exhibited Piccola via presso Perugia; La neve; Una casa ad Anacapri; and Reminiscenze d'Amalfi. At Rome in 1883 he displayed Rocca di Papa; Il caligo a Venice; Sul far del giorno; La pace del Chiostro; and Una sera sulla laguna. He also painted in watercolors, including La neve a Venice, Il fait sa cour, and Sulla marina di Viareggio.
The works of Cabianca's later years show the influence of the Symbolists and the Pre-Raphaelites. He died in Rome on March 21, 1902.
Collections holding works by Vincenzo Cabianca include the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome, and the Brooklyn Museum.

Patriotic Alternative (PA) is a British far-right white nationalist group which states that it has active branches nationwide. Its stance has been variously described as antisemitic, Islamophobic, fascist and racist.
History
Patriotic Alternative was founded in July 2019 by the British neo-Nazi and antisemitic conspiracy theorist Mark Collett, the former director of publicity of the British National Party. In September 2019, PA held its first conference, with Edward Dutton and Colin Robertson giving speeches, among others.
In October 2020, counterterrorism experts reported that extremist far-right groups including Patriotic Alternative were using YouTube to try and recruit people, including children "as young as 12". Later that month, Patriotic Alternative members posted leaflets to over 1,000 homes in Hull, England, claiming that white British people will be a minority in Britain by the 2060s and that the COVID-19 lockdown was an attempt to "take away our freedom".
In December 2020, it was reported that Patriotic Alternative's London regional organiser was Nicholas Hill, a 50-year-old former Liberal Democrat councillor from Catford in South London, known by the online pseudonym "Cornelius". That month, during an appearance by the Labour Party leader Keir Starmer on LBC, a caller referring to herself as "Gemma from Cambridge" put forward the white supremacist Great Replacement conspiracy theory. Starmer was widely criticised for his failure to challenge the caller, who was revealed by investigative group Red Flare to be Jody Swingler, a yoga teacher and Patriotic Alternative activist.
A group called the Antifascist Research Collective infiltrated Patriotic Alternative Scotland's private Telegram group. Working with The Ferret, the Telegram group of around 60 people was found to contain individuals who have been members of, or expressed support for, the Scottish Defence League, the neo-Nazi group Blood and Honour, the British National Party, New British Union, the British Union of Fascists and the Scottish Nationalist Society.
In February 2021, it was reported that Patriotic Alternative was looking to recruit teenagers through Call of Duty: Warzone gaming tournaments.
Tabatha Stirling of Stirling Publishing wrote a series of articles for Patriotic Alternative as "Miss Britannia" describing her son's school as "a hellhole for sensible, secure White boys" and claimed "there is one member of staff who is openly gay, and I mean RuPaul extra gay". On 14 March 2021, Julie Burchill announced that, with Stirling, "I've found someone who's JUST LIKE ME", now publishing her book after Little, Brown Book Group dropped Burchill after she made defamatory statements about the Muslim journalist Ash Sarkar. However, Burchill dropped Stirling Publishing when she found out that Stirling was associated with Patriotic Alternative.
Patriotic Alternative's social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter were suspended in February 2021, but some of its regional pages remain.
In October 2021, Tim Wills, a Conservative Party councillor for Worthing, was suspended from the party over allegations of secret support for Patriotic Alternative after Hope Not Hate published results of an investigation into him. Wills resigned from the council on 15 October. In a district of Borehamwood, the Hertfordshire Constabulary increased patrols after leaflets calling for the banning of kosher and halal food were posted in letterboxes to several Jewish homes. While it was not considered a hate crime, it was considered a hate incident and was condemned by local representatives of all three major political parties.
On 9 August 2022, Patriotic Alternative held its annual White Lives Matter activism which coincides with the United Nations designated International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples.
In September 2022, a joint investigation by The Times and the antifascist investigative group Red Flare revealed the identity of a Patriotic Alternative supporter and "Britain's most racist YouTuber", "The Ayatollah", as James Owens, a 37 year-old journalism graduate from Hixon, a village in Staffordshire.
Links to National Action
The Times reported in October 2021 that Mark Collett attended combat training with former members of the now-proscribed neo-Nazi organisation National Action. The investigation also revealed that Kris Kearns, who leads Patriotic Alternative's "Fitness Club" initiative, was active in National Action before the group was banned. In August 2022, it was reported that Kearns faces extradition from Spain to the UK, and up to 15 years in prison on terrorism charges relating to the sharing of far-right terrorist manifestos on the encrypted messaging app, Telegram. Sam Melia, a regional organiser for PA, has previously been affiliated with National Action.
Political views
Patriotic Alternative promotes a white nationalist ideology and aims to combat the "replacement and displacement" of white British people by migrants who "have no right to these lands". They support deportation of people of "migrant descent", and would offer financially-incentivised repatriation for "those of immigrant descent who have obtained British passports". Patriotic Alternative opposes all immigration unless one has a shared cultural and ethnic background or who can prove British ancestry.
According to Hope Not Hate, members of Patriotic Alternative have supported Holocaust denial, political violence and the white genocide conspiracy theory. They have targeted the LGBT community as being a danger to young children. Patriotic Alternative opposes Black Lives Matter and have displayed White Lives Matter banners around the UK, including on the top of Mam Tor, a hill in Derbyshire.

Tami Lee Bruce (born March 6, 1967) is an American former competition swimmer who represented the United States in two freestyle events at the 1988 Summer Olympics.
Early years
Bruce was born in San Diego in 1967. She attended Hilltop High School in Chula Vista, California, and swam for the Hilltop Lancers high school team. She graduated from Hilltop in 1985. She also trained with the Mission Viejo Nadadores swim team.
College swimming career
Bruce accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in NCAA and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 1986 to 1989. During her four-year college career, she was a seven-time NCAA national champion—three times in the 1,650-yard freestyle (1986, 1987, 1988), twice in the 500-yard freestyle (1986, 1988), once in the 200-yard freestyle, and, together with Paige Zemina, Carmen Cowart and Debbie Daniel, was a member of the Gators' NCAA championship relay team in the 4x200 freestyle relay. She also won seven SEC individual titles in the 500-yard freestyle (1986, 1987, 1988), 1,650-yard freestyle (1986, 1987, 1988), and 200-yard freestyle (1988), was a member of three of the Gators' SEC championship relay teams in the 4x200-yard event (1986, 1987, 1988), and was named SEC Swimmer of the Year (1988).
Bruce was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a "Gator Great" in 2005.
International swimming career
At the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana, Bruce was a double gold medalist in the 400-meter individual medley and the 800-meter freestyle. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, she placed fourth in the world in the women's 400-meter freestyle event with a time of 4:08.16, and fifth in the women's 800-meter freestyle event in 8:30.86.
Bruce attempted a comeback in 1993, after several years out of the pool. While competing for the Australian women's swim team, she finished sixth in the short-course 400-meter freestyle event at the 1993 FINA World Swimming Championships in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.
Life after swimming
Bruce married Australian Olympian and fellow Florida Gator swimmer Duncan Armstrong in October 1989; they have two sons. Armstrong and Bruce later divorced.

The Winchester Psalter is an English 12th-century illuminated manuscript psalter (British Library, Cotton MS Nero C.iv), also sometimes known as the Psalter of Henry of Blois, and formerly known as the St Swithun's Psalter. It was probably made for use in Winchester, most scholars agreeing that the most likely patron was the Henry of Blois, brother of Stephen, King of England, and Bishop of Winchester from 1129 until his death in 1171. Until recent decades it was "a little-studied masterpiece of English Romanesque painting", but it has been the subject of several recent studies.
The manuscript now has 142 vellum leaves of 32 x 22.25 cm, which after a fire in 1731 have been cut and mounted individually, and rebound.
Miniatures
The thirty-eight full-page miniatures are all grouped at the beginning of the manuscript. They are nearly all divided horizontally into two or three compartments with different scenes, creating an unusually extended narrative cycle of more than eighty scenes covering the Old Testament (6 pages), the Life of the Virgin and Life of Christ (23 pages) and several scenes covering the Second Coming and Last Judgement (9 pages) - a number of non-narrative subjects such as the Jesse Tree, Christ in Majesty and an enthroned Virgin being included in these figures. Together they form "one of the most unusual and innovative miniature cycles of the twelfth century"
Most of the miniatures are drawings tinted with coloured washes set against fully painted backgrounds. This is a common English technique from at least the 11th to the 13th century. Two miniatures, of the Death of the Virgin and the Virgin Enthroned, are in a different fully painted technique and style, and follow Byzantine iconographic models, although the forms of the drapery are English in style. The other miniatures are all closely related to one another in style, though some are of markedly higher quality than others. According to Heslop, this is deliberately done to reflect the social status of the subjects depicted; Haney considers it may be the result of an artist working closely with a less skilled assistant. Apart from the two "Byzantine" miniatures, all the others have borders of geometric ornament, onto which the central image sometimes impinges. Many scenes or parts of scenes are just drawn in ink, presumably unfinished, especially towards the end of the cycle. Some paint has been added to areas by a less skilled artist, probably a few decades after the original work. Many miniatures have titles in Norman-French, in a different hand to the main text, probably added later in the 12th century. The original sequence of the miniatures is uncertain.
Haney's analysis of the iconography of the cycle suggests a variety of sources and influences were involved. Some details can be found in Early Christian works such as the Cotton Genesis but not in works from later periods. Other details show awareness of Carolingian and Ottonian traditions, while much else continues Anglo-Saxon and English Romanesque iconography.
Contents
The manuscript contains:
(fols 2r–39r) 38 full-page miniatures
(fols 40r–45v) Calendar illustrated with Labours of the Months and Zodiac Signs
(fols 46r–123v) Psalms 1–150, in parallel Latin and French versions, with decorated or historiated initials at the major divisions
(fols 123v–132r) Canticles, Gloria, Lord's Prayer, and Creeds
(fol 132r–v) Litany
(fols 133v–134r) Fourteen collects
(fols 134r–142v) Thirty-six prayers
(fol 142v) A rubric introducing a text that is now missing from the volume
Patron
Several pieces of evidence suggest that the patron was Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester from 1129 to 1171:
Feasts in the calendar suggest it was made for Winchester
Two feasts in the calendar suggest a connection with Cluny Abbey; Henry of Blois had formerly been a monk of Cluny,
The presence and absence of feasts in the calendar suggest that it was made between 1120 and 1173, or before 1161 according to Wormold and Haney, as the Calendar lacks the feast of Edward the Confessor, canonized in that year,
One of the Latin prayers is addressed to St Swithun, patron saint of Winchester Cathedral, whose relics were in the cathedral; the prayer mentions "sanctis quorum corpora in hac iuxta te requiescunt aula" (saints whose bodies rest in this church next to you)
Some pieces of evidence suggest instead that the manuscript was not made for Henry of Blois, and may instead have been made for a woman, although the personal Latin prayers use masculine forms:
Most 12th-century psalters with series of full-page pictures were apparently made for women
The Litany is not a normal litany of Winchester, but is closely related to the litany of Abingdon Abbey
The litany has a number of female saints who would not be expected in a litany of Abingdon, three of whom are the main saints of the nunnery of Barking Abbey
By about the middle of the 13th century the manuscript was at the nunnery of Shaftesbury Abbey, to judge by a series of additions made to the calendar
History
It is not known where the manuscript was between the 13th century and 1638, when it appears in a catalogue of the collection formed by the antiquary Sir Robert Cotton between about 1588 and 1629, and added to by his son and grandson. The manuscript was damaged in the fire in 1731 at Ashburnham House in which many of the Cotton manuscripts were damaged. As a result, the bifolia were split into single leaves, and there is some uncertainty about their original sequence, which has been partly resolved by the recent discovery of verdigris offsets which confirm which miniatures originally faced each other. Cotton's library formed one of the foundation collections of the British Museum, from which the British Library was formed in 1973. The manuscript was on semi-permanent exhibition at the British Museum, but is now rarely exhibited at the St Pancras site of the British Library.

JSON→URL is a language-independent data interchange format for the JSON data model suitable for use within a URL/URI query string. It is defined by an open specification, though not through a standards body.
Data types and syntax
JSON→URL implements the JSON data model:, with support for the following data types
Number: a signed decimal number that may contain a fractional part and may use exponential E notation, but cannot include non-numbers such as NaN. The format makes no distinction between integer and floating-point.
Boolean: either of the values true or false
null: an empty value, using the word null
String: a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. Strings may be delimited with single-quotation marks if the unquoted value would otherwise be interpreted as a boolean, null, or number. Otherwise, they need not be quoted. Characters which are not valid in a URL must be percent encoded. Space is encoded as + or %20.
Array: an ordered list of one or more values, each of which may be of any type. Arrays use parentheses notation with comma-separated elements.
Object: a collection of one or more name–value pairs where the names (also called keys) are strings. Objects are intended to represent associative arrays, where each key is unique within an object. Objects are delimited with parentheses and use commas to separate each pair, while within each pair the colon character separates the key or name from its value.
Empty: the empty composite value
Example
The following example shows a possible JSON→URL representation describing a person.
(firstName:John,lastName:Smith,isAlive:true,age:27,address:(streetAddress:21+2nd+Street,city:New+York,state:NY,postalCode:10021-3100),phoneNumbers:((type:home,number:212+555-1234),(type:office,number:646+555-4567)),children:(),spouse:null)
Differences from JSON
JSON→URL implements the JSON data model, however, it does not differentiate between an empty object and an empty array. Instead, it defines an empty composite value as ().
Data portability
JSON→URL exchange in an open ecosystem must be encoded in UTF-8. The encoding supports the full Unicode character set, including those characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+10000 to U+10FFFF). Unlike JSON, JSON→URL does not define a separate syntax for escaping characters within a string literal. Such characters are simply composed of one or more percent encoded octets.
Numbers in JSON→URL are agnostic with regard to their representation within programming languages. While this allows for numbers of arbitrary precision to be serialized, it may lead to portability issues. For example, since no differentiation is made between integer and floating-point values, some implementations may treat 42, 42.0, and 4.2E+1 as the same number, while others may not. The JSON→URL standard makes no requirements regarding implementation details such as overflow, underflow, loss of precision, rounding, or signed zeros.
Semantics
While JSON→URL provides a syntactic framework for data interchange, unambiguous data interchange also requires agreement between producer and consumer on the semantics of a specific use of the JSON→URL syntax. One example of where such an agreement is necessary is the serialization of data types local to a specific implementation (e.g. Java, JavaScript) that are not defined in the JSON→URL specification, such as Date.

Florence Kerr Wilson OBE (1879-September 1966) was a pioneer of aviation in East Africa. She founded and operated Wilson Airways Ltd., which operated from airfields in Nairobi from 1929 until the airline was absorbed by the Kenyan military in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. She was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (civil division) in 1933 for her service to civil aviation. She died at her home in Kenya on September 29, 1966. The Wilson Airport in Nairobi was named for her in 1962.
Florence Kerr Fernie was born at Blundellsands, near Liverpool, in 1879. Her family were wealthy shipowners. In 1902 she married William Herbert Wilson (1866-1928), who became a Major in the British Army. After World War I the couple emigrated to Kenya and took up farming. Major Wilson died in 1928.
Wilson Airways
Early in 1929, Florence Kerr Wilson had to travel to the UK for business; instead of taking a long sea voyage, she arranged to fly to England with pilot Tom Campbell Black and flight engineer Archie Watkins. In July 1929 she invested 50,000 UK pounds to found Wilson Airways, with Black and Watkins as flight crew and with a newly purchased Gypsy Moth as their first aircraft. By 1930 Wilson had obtained her pilot's license and carried out survey flights. Wilson Airways became a busy charter service and also implemented scheduled passenger and mail air service in Kenya, connecting to intercontinental flights by Imperial Airways. By 1938 the line operated 13 aircraft.

Against Varimadus the Arian (Contra Varimadum arianum) is an anonymous Nicene theological handbook against the Homoian heresy, written in Latin in a polemical style between 439 and 484. It is in the literary form of testimonia (testimonies), which the reader is supposed to be able to use to respond to Homoian adversaries. It belongs to the genre of heresiology, which was used to define orthodoxy and heresy.
According to its preface, its author was a native of Roman Africa living in exile in Naples after the Vandal takeover of his province. He had received from a "learned and extremely pious" friend a copy of a work written by one Varimadus, whom he describes as "deacon of the Arian sect". He chose to write a lengthy refutation using "weighty evidence" and "legal documents", by which he means the Bible. His quotations from the Bible belong to the Old Latin translation.
Although Against Varimadus presents itself as a refutation of a (now lost) work by Varimadus, there is ample evidence that the author made use of existing anti-Arian writings. The actual, specific beliefs of Varimadus are therefore "unrecoverable". In the preface, the author admits to omitting certain "superfluous and unconnected words ... proffered by [the Arians] to subvert the faithful" in order "to refute those things, which we know to be put forward" by them. Against Varimadus is divided into three books. The first contains 73 headings and concerns the Trinity, especially the equality of God the Son and God the Father. The second concerns the equality of the Holy Spirit with Father and Son. The third, in 100 headings, covers the names of God as found in the Old and New Testaments. The basic structure of a singular refutation is "if they say X, you should say Y".
In some manuscripts, Against Varimadus is erroneously attributed to Vigilius of Thapsus. Its anonymous author is thus sometimes known for convenience as Pseudo-Vigilius. The text is notable as one of only two Latin witnesses to the Book of Enoch (the other being Ad Novatianum). It quotes a single verse.

In functional analysis, a unitary operator is a surjective bounded operator on a Hilbert space that preserves the inner product. Unitary operators are usually taken as operating on a Hilbert space, but the same notion serves to define the concept of isomorphism between Hilbert spaces.
A unitary element is a generalization of a unitary operator. In a unital algebra, an element of the algebra is called a unitary element if ,
where is the identity element.
Definition
Definition 1. A unitary operator is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space that satisfies , where is the adjoint of , and is the identity operator.
The weaker condition defines an isometry. The other condition, , defines a coisometry. Thus a unitary operator is a bounded linear operator which is both an isometry and a coisometry, or, equivalently, a surjective isometry.
An equivalent definition is the following:
Definition 2. A unitary operator is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space for which the following hold:
is surjective, and
preserves the inner product of the Hilbert space, . In other words, for all vectors and in we have:
The notion of isomorphism in the category of Hilbert spaces is captured if domain and range are allowed to differ in this definition. Isometries preserve Cauchy sequences, hence the completeness property of Hilbert spaces is preserved
The following, seemingly weaker, definition is also equivalent:
Definition 3. A unitary operator is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space for which the following hold:
the range of is dense in , and
preserves the inner product of the Hilbert space, . In other words, for all vectors and in we have:
To see that Definitions 1 & 3 are equivalent, notice that preserving the inner product implies is an isometry (thus, a bounded linear operator). The fact that has dense range ensures it has a bounded inverse . It is clear that .
Thus, unitary operators are just automorphisms of Hilbert spaces, i.e., they preserve the structure (the linear space structure, the inner product, and hence the topology) of the space on which they act. The group of all unitary operators from a given Hilbert space to itself is sometimes referred to as the Hilbert group of , denoted or .
Examples
The identity function is trivially a unitary operator.
Rotations in are the simplest nontrivial example of unitary operators. Rotations do not change the length of a vector or the angle between two vectors. This example can be expanded to .
On the vector space of complex numbers, multiplication by a number of absolute value , that is, a number of the form for , is a unitary operator. is referred to as a phase, and this multiplication is referred to as multiplication by a phase. Notice that the value of modulo does not affect the result of the multiplication, and so the independent unitary operators on are parametrized by a circle. The corresponding group, which, as a set, is the circle, is called .
More generally, unitary matrices are precisely the unitary operators on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, so the notion of a unitary operator is a generalization of the notion of a unitary matrix. Orthogonal matrices are the special case of unitary matrices in which all entries are real. They are the unitary operators on .
The bilateral shift on the sequence space indexed by the integers is unitary. In general, any operator in a Hilbert space which acts by permuting an orthonormal basis is unitary. In the finite dimensional case, such operators are the permutation matrices.
The unilateral shift (right shift) is an isometry; its conjugate (left shift) is a coisometry.
The Fourier operator is a unitary operator, i.e. the operator which performs the Fourier transform (with proper normalization). This follows from Parseval's theorem.
Unitary operators are used in unitary representations.
Quantum logic gates are unitary operators. Not all gates are Hermitian.
Linearity
The linearity requirement in the definition of a unitary operator can be dropped without changing the meaning because it can be derived from linearity and positive-definiteness of the scalar product:
Analogously you obtain
Properties
The spectrum of a unitary operator lies on the unit circle. That is, for any complex number in the spectrum, one has . This can be seen as a consequence of the spectral theorem for normal operators. By the theorem, is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by a Borel-measurable on , for some finite measure space . Now implies , -a.e. This shows that the essential range of , therefore the spectrum of , lies on the unit circle.
A linear map is unitary if it is surjective and isometric. (Use Polarization identity to show the only if part.)

Marcello Castellini (; born 2 January 1973) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a defender. He made over 300 appearances in the Italian Serie A and was capped once for Italy in 2003.
Club career
Perugia & Parma
Castellini started his career at hometown club A.C. Perugia. He stayed at the club for 4 Serie C1 seasons. In mid-1994, he joined Parma A.C. of Serie A, which he made his debut on 18 September 1994, in a 2–1 home win against Cagliari Calcio. Castellini had limited chance in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup winner and 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finalists. In 1996–97 season, he rejoined Perugia which won promotion to Serie A last season.
Sampdoria
Owing to Perugia failing to protect its place in Serie A, he was signed by Sampdoria. With the Genoese side he played two Serie A seasons, but in the second season Sampdoria conceded the third largest number of goals in the season, and the side was relegated to Serie B. The Blucerchiati failed to return to Serie A but finished fifth, thus Castellini was signed by Serie A struggler Bologna.
Bologna
In 2001–02 season, Bologna finished 7th and qualified for 2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Castellini played at the finals which lost to Fulham F.C. in a 3–5 aggregate. The 2002–03 season Bologna once again protect his place in Serie A.
Parma return
In August 2003, Castellini was re-signed by UEFA Cup competitor Parma for a reported 3-year contract.
At Parma, Castellini played 32 Serie A matches and 3 games in 2003–04 UEFA Cup, in although the club already have young talents likes Daniele Bonera and Paolo Cannavaro, Castellini played regularly along with Matteo Ferrari. During the season, he was call-up to national team for the first time and played against Romania. Italy at that time qualified for UEFA Euro 2004 and aimed to find the best squad to the tournament. The friendly match ended in 1–0 won and Castellini played as Fabio Cannavaro's substitute in the 55th minute. He received another call-up in March 2004 but withdrew duo to injury.
Sampdoria return
As Parma faced financial difficulty as their sponsor Parmalat was facing scandal, Matteo Ferrari and Castellini, one of the backbone of the defensive line, were turned to cash and washed out to decrease wage expense. Castellini re-joined Sampdoria for just €0.8million. At Sampdoria he played 22 Serie A as Castellini missed the field in October and in March. He also played once in Serie A only in November. With the effort of Francesco Antonioli and other members of the defensive line including Castellini, the Genoese team finished fifth and conceded the third fewest goals. In the second season, Castellini played 33 league matches but just played three out of six UEFA Cup matches.
Bologna return
A surplus for young Sampdoria, Along with Francesco Antonioli, Castellini were signed by Serie A newcomer Bologna in June 2006. This time at Serie B. The defensive duo made a contribution to the team to win promotion to Serie A again in 2008 by conceding the fewest goals along with U.S. Lecce, But Castellini was too old for the Italian top division and he just made 13 appearances. Along with Antonioli, the duo released again after Bologna almost failed to avoid relegation back to Serie B.
International career
Castellini made his only senior international appearance for Italy under manager Giovanni Trapattoni, on 16 November 2003, in a 1–0 friendly home win over Romania.

Nobody Is Listening is the third studio album by English singer-songwriter Zayn. It was released on 15 January 2021 through RCA Records. The album features guest appearances from Syd and Devlin. It follows his previous album, Icarus Falls, which was released in late 2018. The album was preceded by the release of the singles "Better" and "Vibez". Upon release, Nobody Is Listening received generally favorable reviews from critics; the album peaked at number 44 on the US Billboard 200 and number 17 on the UK Albums Chart.
Background
The album's artwork is designed by Zayn himself and is inspired by expressionism and graffiti. The cover was revealed on his website along with the CD pre-order on 8 January 2021.
The album was supported by the singles "Better" and "Vibez". The album contains eleven tracks including the two singles. Zayn said to have "total creative rein" on the project, as well as "making the music he has always wanted to". In an interview with Entertainment Daily, Zayn described the album as his "most personal project to date".
Critical reception
The album holds an aggregate score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic based on nine reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Dhruva Balram of NME wrote that the album "has its flaws" and that it "doesn't add many new colours to his palette" but complimented it for being "wrenchingly intimate and sweetly playful" and "quietly purposeful pop" and that it is "a step in a new and fresh direction for the enigmatic artist". Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos felt that Malik "found his sweet spot" with the record, naming "Tightrope" and "River Road" as "two of Malik's best songs to date". Jem Aswad of Variety named the album "concise and to the point" and felt that it "clears the table for whatever might be coming next". Malvika Padin of Clash felt that the record "indicates that he's achieved some sort of clarity on the direction he wants to take as a solo artist" although she felt that it had "minimal production and few moments of experimentation" that "only offers negligible glimpses into Zayn's personality".
Kitty Empire of The Guardian felt that Malik sounds "freer than ever before" while naming his voice "assuredly elastic", feeling that "the songs suit him more and more" and that he "keeps refining"; she felt the record as a whole was an improvement over Icarus Falls. Writing for AllMusic, Neil Yeung felt that the album was "a logical turn" and "moving closer toward heartfelt love songs instead of exaggerated playboy fantasies" while naming it his "most mature album to date." Craig Jenkins of Vulture wrote that Malik's "solo career still makes no sense, yet the intrigue remains earned" while calling him "a stronger man for his efforts, however seemingly minimal," ending his review by opining that his "way to write songs that lean into the strength of his voice and speaks coolly and quietly to the ups and downs of a high-profile romance will suffice." Sheldon Pearce of The New Yorker opined that "his music has often felt a bit forced" but felt that "he finally taps into something more natural: sophisticated, largely atmospheric pop that simmers like quiet-storm R. & B."
In a less positive review, Alexandra Pollard of The Independent opined the album as "a blancmange of watered-down R&B" and felt that it lacked personality. She went on to write that "the lyrics feel insultingly half-arsed" and that he "doesn't do it [his voice] justice here". Kate Solomon of The Daily Telegraph felt the album lacked personality while writing that "he has nothing mature to say" and "fails to make the most of his talents". Writing for The Evening Standard, David Smyth felt that the record included "largely hazy, stoned R&B, offering blurred textures and smoky atmospheres but few standout moments" and that he "may not be sustainable unless the music speaks a little louder"; he did, however, compliment Malik's voice, writing that it was "undoubtable that his vocal ability was wasted on One Direction's primary-coloured pop." Louise Bruton of The Irish Times wrote that Malik "has now found his niche in lo-fi R&B-pop that's intentionally made without any aim at all." Dani Blum, writing for Pitchfork, called the album a "low bar he congratulates himself for clearing—knowing that no matter what he sings, legions of fans will listen" and felt that "he's never sounded like this much of an amateur" while naming the songs "blathering and diluted, a derivation of a derivation. Writing for Renowned for Sound, Angus Whitfield felt that the album "might have had more weight, importance and potential relatability" if it had focused more on "his struggle with fame and mental health" as opposed to "love making and smoking weed." He complimented tracks like "Outside" and "When Love's Around" (calling Syd's feature "welcome and warming") but criticized "Vibez" as "boring and repetitive" and disliked Devlin's "aggressive rapping" in "Windowsill".

Bovenden is a municipality in the district of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony, Germany. In 2010 the population in the eight villages belonging to the municipality was 13,350.
Geography
Bovenden is situated on the river Leine, approx. 6 km north of Göttingen and on the north western border of Göttingen Forest. The main village of the municipality, Bovenden, is between Ostererg and the Keuperrücken of the Lieth, a small river which flows into the river Leine. On a hill east of the village Eddigehausen stand the remains of the Plesse Castle.
Parts of the municipality
The municipality is divided into the following villages:
Billingshausen
Bovenden, main village
Eddigehausen
Emmenhausen
Harste
Lenglern
Reyershausen
Spanbeck
Furthermore, there are the former villages that have ceased to be since the Middle Ages:
Rodershausen oder Rodershusen (2 km to the northwest of Bovenden)
Aspe oder Aspa (1 km to the northeast of Spanbeck)
Botleveshusen (0,2 km to the west of Mariaspring)
Backenhusen (1,2 km to the east of Reyershausen)
Sturmbeke oder Stumbeke (0,9 km to the west of Reyershausen)
Population development
The population of the main village Bovenden has increased ever since the second half of the 20th century:
History
The village of Bovenden is first mentioned in a deed by Otto I from February 2, 949, in which the future emperor certifies a barter with Hersfeld Abbey. In this first designation the toponym was Bobbenzunon. In the following years the village was also referred to as Bobbantun (1141), Bobentun (1170), and Bobentum (1191). Since the 13th century the name Boventen was commonly used and since the end of the 16th century today's designation Bovenden was introduced. The origin of the town name is contended. One derivation is the combination of the personal name Bovo or Bob(b)o with the suffix -tun. The suffix -tun is Low German and means "fence, confinement, or fenced area". Consequently, the name might refer to a settlement founded or governed by Bobo. Another interpretation is that the stem of the name is derived from bioðan (=„above“, cf. Low German boven), referring to the contrained settlement above the flood plain of the Leine.
In the 12th century the aristocratic family of the "Herren von Bovenden" makes its first appearance. They are mentioned in a document in 1170 for the first time. In this document, which contains information about bestowals in the area around Bovenden to the Abbey Helmershausen, Bobo of Bovenden is mentioned as one of the witnesses. Starting in 1211 the "Herren von Bovenden" appear as the patrons of the local chapel. In the following decades the family of Bovenden succeeded in enlarging their property. Bovenden remained nevertheless the main village, in which seven farms, eleven and a half hooves of land, two meadows and the castle were included. The family of Bovenden appeared as Burgmanns at the Hardenberg, served as Mainzians, and were often witnesses at the Hardenbergers, a noble family of Lower Saxony. Despite the vicinity to the Electorate of Mainz the family of Bovenden also took feudal tenures from the House of Welf. In the 14th century the family of Bovenden sided mainly with the family of Braunschweig, for example in 1364 Knight Günther of Bovenden promised Duke Otto to help him with everything except the archbishop of Mainz. And in case Duke Otto managed to free him of the alliance with the Electorate of Mainz Knight Günther would serve only Duke Otto. The influence of the family of Boventen on the history of the area was significant for two centuries until the end of the 14th century. Only the line of Lenglern continued the name after 1500. The possessions of the Herren of Bovenden, which are referred to as nobiles and miles in documents, were transferred to the noble men of Plesse. Today, the key in Bovenden's emblem indicates the relationship to the Electorate of Mainz as Burgmans at the Hardenberg.
The Herren of Bovenden are the most significant landowners in Bovenden since the 14th century. They gave their whole estate to Landgrave Louis I of Hesse in 1447 and received the estate again as a feudal tenure. Through this measure the Herren of Bovenden were able to obtain a higher degree of home rule in front of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. After the line of Plesse ended in 1571 the rule was transferred to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and the area turned into a Hesse enclave. Since the 16th century Bovenden received more rights as a consequence of being the most important location of the reign of the Plesse family. These rights included that Bovenden was designated a "Flecken" since 1587 which showed that the area has a market right and since 1605 Bovenden was also bestowed with brewing right.
After Plesse Castle was abandoned in 1660, Bovenden turned into the administrative center. Starting in 1777, a new representative baroque building replaced two former Meierhofs of the Steina Abbey. The representative and administrative tasks were executed in this Hesse castle until 1815. The building further served as the hunting lodge of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rotenburg. The location of the enclave provided various professions with special development possibilities.
Due to the founding of the University of Göttingen in 1737 Bovenden experienced an economic boost in the second half of the 18th century. Many students came to the Hesse-Kassel enclave to watch traveling theater groups, eat in the tavern "Zum letzten Heller" as well as to drive to the tavern in Rauschenwasser. It was also popular to purchase wine, spirits, coffee, and sugar there as these goods were burdened with luxury taxes in Göttingen. As these activities were regarded as a waste of time and incurring debts by the students, the authorities of Göttingen University came up with the term "Dangers of Bovenden."
In the context of a local government transformation in Germany in 1973 the eight villages of the area were merged to become the municipality of Bovenden.

Jack Raymond Janney (June 17, 1924 – October 9, 2006), born in Alamosa, Colorado, was a U.S. structural engineer and an innovator in the understanding of structural behavior and a recognized leader in the investigation of structural collapses. Janney's love of mathematics and science spurred his decision to become an engineer, and in 1942, he enrolled in the College of Engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder. After only one semester, Janney left college and enlisted in the Navy where he became a decorated pilot during World War II.
After the war, Janney returned to the University of Colorado at Boulder where he earned his bachelor's degree in architectural engineering in 1948 and his master's degree in structural engineering in 1950. Janney's graduate-school thesis on prestressed concrete was recognized as one of the first comprehensive papers written on the subject in the United States. Subsequently, the Portland Cement Association (PCA) hired Janney to conduct research on prestressed concrete at its newly constructed laboratories in Skokie, Illinois, where he worked from 1950 to 1956. During his time with the Portland Cement Association Janney published a journal entitled "Nature of Bond in Pre-Tensioned Prestressed Concrete," which displayed results from numerous experiments he performed to determine the effectiveness of prestressed concrete. One of the experiments Janney performed on prestressed concrete was called the "Prism Test." Through the "Prism Test," Janney gained a lot of new and valuable knowledge on the effects of prestressed concrete and he was able to develop superior methods of creating very strong prestressed concrete for engineering during that time period.
In 1956, Janney started his own consulting engineering firm that would eventually become Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. (WJE). The company today employs 470 professionals in nineteen offices nationwide. Janney's first project as a consulting engineer was on behalf of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, overseeing the manufacturing of precast, prestressed concrete girders for bridges for the tollway.
In WJE's early years, Janney pioneered the use of three-dimensional scale models for determining the distribution of strains and stresses in structures, before the advent of computers and structural analysis programs. Janney performed more than 60 scale-model studies from 1958 to 1969 on many important structures, including Chicago's First National Bank, the Kodak Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair, and the hyperbolic paraboloid roof for TWA's maintenance hangar in Kansas City, Missouri. WJE needed to design, construct, and test a scale model of the roof for the TWA Maintenance Hangar due to its unusual geometry. This model provided an enormous challenge due to the size and complexity required to design the model.
During his 50-plus year career, Janney investigated upwards of 500 structural collapses and more than 4,000 cases of structural distress. Projects include the Bailey's Crossroads Apartments collapse near Washington, DC, in 1973, the cooling-tower scaffolding failure at the Willow Island Nuclear Plant in West Virginia in 1976, the Civic Center Coliseum collapse in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1978; and the Rosemont Horizon collapse near Chicago, Illinois, in 1981.
A member of numerous professional organizations, Janney served many years on the Research Council on the Performance of Structures for the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). He was also an original member of the joint ASCE/American Concrete Institute (ACI) committee that formulated provisions for prestressed concrete in the ACI Building Code.
Janney was also active in the Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI), the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), serving as chair of a number of committees in each. He served on the Board of Directors for both ACI and PCI as well. Janney's innovative book, Guide to Investigation of Structural Failure (ASCE Press 1979), remains a landmark text in the industry.
A recipient of many professional honors throughout his life, Janney received the Distinguished Engineering Alumnus Award from the University of Colorado in 1985, the John F. Parmer Award from the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois in 2000, the Forensic Engineer of the Year Award from the Technical Council on Forensic Engineering in 1991, and Civil Engineer of the Year Award from the Illinois Section of ASCE in 1979. In 1991, Janney was also elevated to Honorary Member status in ASCE. Janney's early work in precast concrete also earned him recognition as one of 50 "Titans" of the precast/prestressed concrete industry at the 50th PCI anniversary conference in 2004.
Engineering News-Record (ENR) twice honored Janney with its "Those Who Made Marks" designation in 1967, for his full-scale testing (to failure) of several buildings at the New York World's Fair and in 1982 for innovations employed in the rehabilitation of Chicago's Soldier Field. In 1999 as part of its 125th anniversary, ENR selected Mr. Janney as one of its "125 Top People of the Past 125 Years" in the construction industry.
Janney retired as President of WJE and returned to his native Colorado in 1980. He remained an active member on WJE's Board of Directors until his death in 2006.

Teodor Toša Apostolović (Serbian Cyrillic: Тоша Апостоловић; a village near Thessaloniki, 1745 - Zemun, 1810) was a Serbian merchant and philanthropist.
Biography
When the Austrians withdrew from Belgrade, between 1765 and 1770,Teodor Apostolović, a Serb from Southern Serbia, moved to Zemun with them and did not want to remain under the Turkish rule. He was born in the vicinity of Thessaloniki in 1745. Some chroniclers say that he was of Greek origin and that his name was Theodoros Apostolos, which he changed with his arrival. He was a wax worker, a manufacturer of soap and candles, and thanks to his skills, he earned a great fortune. He became a respectable citizen and philanthropist, a church counselor, and was the president of the Zemun church community when Zemun had 6,000 inhabitants. In 1786, he built the Church of the Holy Archangel Gabriel,which became a monastery in 1990.He was also a close friend of Hadži Ruvimand contributed financially to Karađorđe's Serbia.
As he got older, he contracted eye disease which made him unable to distinguish silver from gold bars while buying from a Russian merchant.He went to the churches and prayed to Saint Nicholas to restore his vision. According to legend, one night Saint Nicholas appeared in his dream, who told him to go to a Belgrade suburb, Bežanijska kosa, and bring with him an empty, voluminous barrel and roll it downhill. Wherever it stops, he must dig a well and plant trees around it, so that he can wash with water from the well in order to regain his sight. He did as he was told in a dream, dug a well and even built a tavern next to it.Indeed, the water from the well possessed curative properties and Toša's vision was restored.
Shortly after the well was built, it became a favorite picnic spot for the people of Zemun, and the entire area around the well was named "Toša's well" during Toša Apostolović's lifetime. Immediately before his death, he bequeathed the vineyard land and the well to the National Church.
He died in 1810 in Zemun.

A marotte is a prop stick or sceptre with a carved head on it. Jesters usually used a marotte. The word is borrowed from the French, where it signifies either a fool's (literal) "bauble" or a fad.
Typically carried by a jester or Arlecchino, the miniature head often reflects the costume of the jester who carries it. Modern marottes typically have music boxes or other machinery built into the head. Older marottes may utilize swivel heads with bells.
In popular culture
In the children's TV series Rentaghost, the stick was referred to as a "Tiny Timothy".
In Verdi's opera Rigoletto, the singer of the title role, a jester, carries a marotte, which often has on it the faces of comedy and tragedy.

Ayogu Kingsley Ifeanyichukwu is a Nigerian artist known for his hyperrealist style.
Early life and career
Born in Enugu, the eastern part of Nigeria, Ayogu developed interest in painting and art from a very young age, this interest led him to studying painting and graphics from Enugu State College of Education (Technical). In an interview with BBC Igbo, he said he started painting as a child before developing his style of hyperrealism.
Style of art
A reviewer described Ayogu's work as having "stunning, lens-like detail" depicting "situations with a wide spectrum of displayed emotion through tears, despair and affinity. The viewer of his pieces is compelled to feel connected to the paintings."
In an interview with BBC Igbo, he described his major challenge as having to import his tools. In an article on Guardian Newspaper his art was described as "terrifyingly visceral, so lifelike you feel you could touch them".

Alnmouth Saltmarsh and Dunes is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Northumberland, England. It is the largest saltflat on the north-east coast, located on the south bank of the River Aln estuary, and notable for the varied plant community found on the interface between the saltflats and the dunes. It overlaps with and forms part of the much larger Northumberland Shore SSSI.
Location and natural features
Alnmouth Saltmarsh and Dunes is situated in the north-east of England at Alnmouth, a village at the mouth of the River Aln where it empties into the North Sea on the east coast. The site covers the south bank of the estuary from a point due west of the village, and follows the coast south for about to Buston Links, east of High Buston. Warkworth Dunes and Saltmarsh SSSI is immediately to the south, and both fall within the scope of the Northumberland Shore SSSI. The site extends to and covers estuarine saltflats and a single ridge of dune extending south from the river mouth.
Alnmouth's saltmarsh owes its origins to a shift in the course of the river which occurred in 1806. Before that time, the river passed to the west of Church Hill at the north-west end of the large single sandbank immediately to the south of the estuary, taking an oxbow course around the hill to discharge slightly south of today's river. A violent storm on Christmas Day in that year allowed the river to break through the northern extent of the sandbank to assume its current course - in the process cutting off and destroying the remains of the village's Church of St. Waleric, which stood at the northern end of the sandbank. The river's previous course became silt-filled, forming much of the saltmarsh now of scientific interest.
Vegetation
The saltmarsh is ungrazed and is dominated by sea-purslane (Halimione portulacoides) and by the most northerly British colony of the seaweeds Bostrychia scorpioides, Fucus vesiculosus and Pelvetia canaliculata. Higher levels of the marsh support thrift (Armeria maritima), common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima), sea-plantain (Plantago maritima) and sea aster (Aster tripolium) associated with the sea-purslane. Much of the intertidal mud has been colonised by common cord-grass (Spartina anglica), but open areas and saltmarsh creeks are used by feeding and roosting gulls, dunlin and other waders including redshank, curlew and snipe.
Common reed (Phragmites australis) and three locally rare species, sea rush (Juncus maritimus), parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis) are found at the freshwater inflow area of the marsh.
A distinct habitat is provided by the interface between saltmarsh and dune and supports reflexed saltmarsh grass (Puccinellia distans), hard-grass (Parapholis strigosa) and sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima). The dune ridge supports marram (Ammophila arenaria), and lesser meadow-rue (Thalictrum minus) with bloody crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum) and hound's-tongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is found on the lower landward slopes. The site extends to areas of shorter turf, which supports cowslip (Primula veris), early-purple orchid (Orchis mascula), violets (Viola spp.), and yarrow (Achillea millefolium), with widespread early forget-me-not (Myosotis ramosissima), common cornsalad (Valerianella locusta), hairy tare (Vicia hirsuta), and crosswort (Galium cruciata).
A further distinctive habitat is provided by an area of gravel exposed by historic sand extraction, and on which grows wild thyme (Thymus praecox), common stork's-bill (Erodium cicutarium), mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella) and common centaury (Centaurium erythraea) together with common bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), common restharrow (Ononis repens), blue fleabane (Erigeron acer), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha) and fern-grass (Desmazeria rigida). The margin of this area supports viper's-bugloss (Echium vulgare) and bloody crane's-bill.
Condition
The site is divided into four units for SSSI management purposes. The condition of all was rated "favourable" in 2007 (units 1 & 2) and 2009 (units 3 & 4).
Ownership
The site is owned by Northumberland Estates, the estate company of Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland, and is leased to the National Trust.

The SCR-68 (SCR was a military term meaning Set, Complete, Radio) was a military radiotelephone used by the US Army Signal Corps as an aircraft radio in the waning months of World War I. Due to its many problems, primarily its inability to communicate with other radios, like its ground component the SCR-67 or the larger truck mounted SCR-108, over large distances, the SCR-68 quickly became obsolete. Nonetheless, the SCR-68 was one of the first steps towards developing more effective messaging between pilots and commanders, even beyond military usage.
Capabilities
The SCR-68 had a few distinct characteristics that separated the SCR-68 from other types of radio. The SCR-68 operated at 750 kHz (400 meter wavelength), using a long wire antenna reeled out behind the aircraft. It could receive and transmit messages over a maximum range of eighteen miles. The artillery observer (navigator) managed the SCR-68, receiving and relaying messages for the pilot. During World War I, most planes were two-person open-cockpit aircraft. Instead of communicating between themselves in the air, the pilot and the observer sent messages through the SCR-68 where the headphones would eliminate most outside noises. Like a private telephone line, the pilot and observer could communicate with each other; however, this action prevented the SCR-68 from receiving any transmissions.
Problems
Advancements with the SCR-68 were marred by its flaws. Military tests by British soldiers reported the difficulty of getting the proper balance with the oscillating and control values. The SCR-68 range was reliable within a five-mile radius, a serious issue when the airplane needed to travel long distances. Another issue with the SCR-68 was the static noise that came from the “ripples” in the generator commutation. The noise was faint and was only considered a problem when receiving messages that exceeded 5 miles. It was later found that metal shielding placed around the wiring helped to prevent this problem.
Origins
The US Army pushed for better technology to gain an advantage in World War I. The US Army asked private American companies to build a device that would establish better communication between military aircraft and themselves. Western Electric developed the SCR-68 that met qualifications: the radio was condensed to a size that could fit inside the airplane, simple for an Observer to use in flight, and the antenna would not drastically affect the movements of the aircraft. Another problem in the past included a communication device that eliminated the most disturbances from engine noise; the SCR-68 provided that by including a microphone and a sound-proof helmet. By the summer of 1918, approximately 3,000 units were manufactured and distributed to the US Army.
Parts
Radio Set
Inside the suitcase-shaped box BC-11A was the circuit apparatus used for receiving and transmitting messages. The dials were used to control the frequency of the radio. The flip paddle switched the radio from receive to transmit and vice versa. The dimensions of the box were 17 inches by 10 inches by 7 inches and weighed 21 pounds.
Intercom
The BC-10 (SCR-57) intercom control box for switching between onboard communication and ground communication.
Antenna
The A-21 retractable antenna was located in the rear of the aircraft and was expanded by the air observer while in flight. It could reel out to 300 feet in length, was made out of two copper wires and weighed 19.5 pounds. Depending on the amount of antenna allowed behind the airplane, the antenna functioned at a wavelength of 750 kHz.
Generator
The GN-1 wind-powered generator was located on the braces of the landing gear, to gather adequate wind power and not hinder any other parts of the aircraft. The generator, as well as three 22.5 volt batteries located in the BC-11, provided a plate voltage at 300 volts and a filament voltage at 30 volts. The wind-powered generator was not very efficient, requiring the airplane to travel at fast speeds in order for the generator to work properly.

• T-3 Single button Chest microphones for sending messages
• HS-1 Headphones, to eliminate external sounds

Nidda station is a station on the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway in the town of Nidda in the German state of Hesse. It is also at the end of the Beienheim–Schotten railway from Friedberg station. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 4 station.
History
The station was opened on 29 June 1870 with the opening of the end of the second section of the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway (Hungen–Nidda) by the Upper Hessian Railway Company (). At the end of November 1870, the line was extended to Gelnhausen. On 1 October 1897, the Beienheim–Schotten railway was opened from Beienheim via Nidda to Schotten. This made Nidda a major railway junction of the Wetterau.
On 29 November 1959, passenger services on the Nidda–Schotten section were abandoned. Freight still operated until February 1960, when it was closed due to lack of demand. Its track was dismantled a few months afterwards.
The station (except the “house” platform, platform 1) was fully modernised in 2008 and 2009. The platforms on tracks 2 and 4 and on tracks 5 and 7 were renewed and raised to a uniform height of 55 centimetres.
Infrastructure
The Nidda station precinct covers a large area. In addition to the numerous parked railcars of the Butzbach-Lich Railway Company (Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn, BLE), which operated services here until 2005, loading sidings, an engine shed and the industrial sidings of a chemical plant are spread over a large area in the southern part of the precinct.
Entrance building
The entrance building is protected as a monument under the Hessian Heritage Act.
Operations
Services on weekends and public holidays were restored on the Gießen–Gelnhausen line at the timetable change on 14 December 2003.
Operations on the Beienheim–Schotten railway were managed by the Butzbach-Lich Railway Company until the timetable change of 2004/2005. Since the timetable change of 2005/2006, it has been operated by the Hessische Landesbahn (Hessian State Railway, HLB), the parent company of the Butzbach-Lich Railway Company.
Although the station is unstaffed now, there is a lot of traffic when the trains to and from Gelnhausen, Giessen and Friedberg meet and allow mutual transfers. Trains depart from platform 2 towards Giessen, from track 4 towards Gelnhausen and from tracks 5 and 7 towards Friedberg. Track 1 formerly served trains towards Schotten.
Current services
HLB operates trains every hour on the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway between Gießen and Gelnhausen using GTW 2/6 sets. In the morning peak and after lunch an extra service runs to both Gießen and Gelnhausen, and in the evening peak an extra service runs from Gießen.
On the Beienheim–Schotten railway, service runs every hour via Echzell, Reichelsheim and Beienheim to Friedberg. During peak hours there are direct through services to and from Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof. Two of these Stadt-Express (SE) services are operated by DB Regio with a class 218 locomotive hauling refurbished Silberling carriages. One SE service and the Regionalbahn services to and from Friedberg are operated by HLB using GTW 2/6 sets.
Nidda station is served by some regional and city bus routes.

Marcel Dadi (; 20 August 1951 – 17 July 1996) was a Tunisian-born Jewish French virtuoso guitarist known for his finger-picking style which faithfully recreated the instrumental styles of American guitarists such as Chet Atkins, Merle Travis and Jerry Reed. He became a friend of country star Chet Atkins.
Biography
Early life
Marcel Dadi was born in Sousse, Tunisia on 20 August 1951. Dadi, along with his immediate family, moved to Paris, France in 1954. In 1961, he started playing guitar at age 10. He had joined Andre Assouline, Joseph Illouz, and Maurice Levy to form a rock instrumental band by 1964. He was inspired by the music of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, He continued to expand his musical horizons with the influence of a guitarist, Bernard Photzer, who introduced him to the music of Elvis Presley and other 1950's rockers. Photzer also taught him the rudiments of flatpicking. As a soloist with French singer-songwriter and guitarist, Hugues Aufray, Dadi began to develop his own approach to flatpicking. From 1972, he wrote instructional articles for Folk Music Review, wherein he introduced his rigorous training method, which utilizes a fingering chart, in the March 1972 issue.
Career
Dadi released several LPs and some instructional videos before his early death. His recordings featured a mix of compositions by his American heroes and original compositions of his own in a similar style. A feature of his early LPs was that they included a tablature booklet, allowing guitarists to learn the tunes for themselves. Dadi often recorded tunes dedicated to his friends, such as "Roger Chesterfield," dedicated to Roger C. Field with whom he first went to Nashville in 1975 to visit Chet Atkins.
Marcel Dadi immigrated to Eilat (Israel) on the Red Sea, in 1983, and lived there with his wife and young son for several years before moving back to France. In 1988, Eric Clapton, his longtime family friend, came to Eilat to visit Marcel Dadi.
Death
On 17 July 1996, en route from New York City to Paris with his band and his long time friend Serge Sloimovits, Marcel Dadi died when the Boeing 747-131 operating TWA Flight 800 exploded off the coast of Long Island. He was returning from the United States to France after being honored at Nashville's Country Music Hall of Fame.
Marcel Dadi's body was recovered, as were those of all of the other victims. He is buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, Israel.
Certified Guitar Player
Marcel Dadi was honoured as one of the five "Certified Guitar Players" by Chet Atkins.

You Can't Buy Everything is a 1934 American pre-Code romantic drama film directed by Charles Reisner and Sandy Roth and starring May Robson, Jean Parker and Lewis Stone. It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Working titles of the film were Rich Widow and Old Hannibal. According to Motion Picture Herald, the principal character of Hannah Bell (played by May Robson) was modeled after Hetty Green, famous as the miserly "Witch of Wall Street."
Plot
In 1893 New York, Mrs. Hannah Bell (May Robson) takes her son Donny to a charitable medical clinic, where she gives a false name and information in order to avoid paying (Hetty Green notoriously tried to do the same thing for her son Edward). However, her friend Kate Farley (Mary Forbes) visits the clinic (which she generously supports) and recognizes Donny. She makes Hannah pay for the boy's treatment.
Later, Hannah reads in the newspaper that John Burton (Lewis Stone) has been named vice president of the Knickerbocker Bank. Furious, she goes to see her longtime friend and banker Asa Cabot to withdraw all of her money immediately. He is unable to find out why she hates Burton, but refuses to accept his offered resignation. It is later revealed that Burton abandoned Hannah without explanation just before their wedding. She later married a man she did not love who she knew was only after her wealth, just to salvage her pride. Her husband squandered her money, leaving her in desperate financial straits. She painstakingly made herself rich, all for her son's sake, and became a miser just like her father.
In 1904, Donny is the valedictorian of his graduating class at Princeton University. He wants to become a writer, but Hannah insists he work at the bank where she has entrusted her now immense wealth.
In 1907, Kate learns something about Hannah's relationship to John Burton, and tries to secretly arrange a meeting between them. It does not work, but does unintentionally bring together Donny (played by William Bakewell as a man) and Burton's daughter Elizabeth (Jean Parker). They fall in love. However, Elizabeth at first refuses to marry Donny because she feels that he cannot stand up to his domineering mother. When Hannah finds out about the relationship, she storms into Burton's office and accuses him of trying to get her money through his daughter. He denies plotting against her, but refuses to interfere with the couple. Donny and Elizabeth get married without her approval. She does not even attend the wedding (though she watches from in hiding as the happy newlyweds leave the church).
When the Panic of 1907 threatens the banking system of the United States, a committee appeals to Hannah for a desperately needed loan. She is uninterested, until they show her a list of gilt-edged stocks they are offering as security; she spots Burton's own railroad shares and provides the money as a demand loan (on which she can demand repayment at any time). Just after Burton receives his share of the loan to satisfy his bank clients, Hannah notifies him that she wants the loan paid back. Instead of returning the money, he decides to forfeit his stock rather than abandon his depositors. Hannah is delighted to finally avenge herself on her former fiance, having wrested control of the railroad away from him.
Donny, just returned from his honeymoon in Europe, gets Burton's side of the story. Then he denounces his mother, accusing her of never loving him, but rather treating him as just another of her possessions. He informs her that Burton left her at the altar because her father tried to get him to sign an agreement never to touch her money. Burton assumed she knew and approved of the stipulation, whereas she never did until now. Stunned by the revelation, she goes outside to the park to think.
She catches pneumonia, but recovers. Donny comes to see her, and they are reconciled. She also embraces her daughter-in-law. When Burton shows up (having received the railroad stocks back), that vendetta is also ended.

The Sheffield Urban Area is a conurbation in the North of England with a population of 685,368 according to the 2011 census. This was a 7% increase on the 2001 population of 640,720 making it the 8th largest conurbation in the United Kingdom and England's 6th largest. Named the Sheffield Urban Area by the Office for National Statistics, it must not be confused with the Sheffield City Region, a non-government term, although often used, particularly by the business community. In 2001 the population density of the urban area was 3,949.2 people per km2 by 2011 this had increased slightly to 4,092 people per km2.
The city of Sheffield contributes just over two thirds of the population of the whole conurbation.
Subdivisions
The conurbation's population is made up of the following subdivision, defined by the Office for National Statistics:
Nearby places
Settlements very close to the conurbation but not included in the official statistics include Wharncliffe Side and Oughtibridge, which are separated from Hillsborough by Worrall and a half-mile stretch of the A6102 Middlewood Road North and the towns of Wath upon Dearne, Brampton Bierlow, Swinton, Mexborough, Darfield and Conisbrough which are part of the Dearne Valley Urban Area and are separated from Rawmarsh by the Wentworth Road, with the A633 and Dearne Valley railway lines.
Slightly further afield, Dronfield, in Derbyshire, is around half a mile away from the Greenhill area of the city along the A61 and B6158.

The Forum Cafeteria was a chain of economical cafeteria-style restaurants which operated across the United States. The company was founded in 1918 and had restaurants in the downtown areas of several major cities. In the 1960s the company expanded its business concept to suburban areas, opening shopping center locations at Antioch Shopping Center, Kansas City, Missouri and the Dadeland Shopping Center southwest of Miami.
The company was founded by Clarence Hayman (1881–1971) who owned several restaurant venues before establishing the concept of a ground floor cafeteria, in 1921, at 1220 Grand Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri. He later opened similar branches in other cities of the Midwestern United States. Clem Templin (1884–1966) was a vice president of the firm. The building architect for the cafeterias was George B. Franklin (1883–1953)

The Vice is an advanced squeeze in contract bridge. Its distinguishing motive is presence of a "vice" menace in one suit, where one defender holds cards of equivalent rank which split the declarer's pair of cards in front of him, where his partner has a winner in the suit. It was first attested by Terence Reese in the book "The Expert Game", a.k.a. "Master Play in Contract Bridge". In other words, the defenders have a "high" finesse position, equivalent to the one in diagram:
If West can be forced to abandon QJ, the defenders will take only one trick in the suit.
A similar motive is encountered in guard squeezes, however, in the vice, the defenders have a winner in the suit. Since that winner will take a trick, this squeeze is without .
Examples
Hearts are the "vice suit", and the second menace is the declarer's 8. This is a position akin to automatic simple squeeze. When South leads the high 5, West must not discard the 10; when he parts with a heart honor, declarer leads the heart and East must cede the last trick to dummy's heart ten.
When the second menace (diamonds) is in dummy, it must be a two-card menace accompanied by an entry, otherwise West can safely abandon the suit; if the K were absent, the West can discard the diamond winner, as the declarer will not have the entry to enjoy it.

The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a document prepared periodically by the executive branch of the United States that lists the national security concerns and how the administration plans to deal with them. The legal foundation for the document is spelled out in the Goldwater–Nichols Act. The document is purposely general in content, and its implementation relies on elaborating guidance provided in supporting documents such as the National Military Strategy.
Purposes of the NSS report
The stated intent of the Goldwater–Nichols legislation is broadly accepted as valid for effective political discourse on issues affecting the nation's security—the Congress and the Executive need a common understanding of the strategic environment and the administration's intent as a starting point for future dialogue. That said, however, it is understood that in the adversarial environment that prevails, this report can only provide a beginning point for the dialogue necessary to reach such a "common" understanding.
The requirement of producing this report along with the budget request leads to an iterative, interagency process involving high level meetings that helps to resolve internal differences in foreign policy agendas. However, "this report was not to be a neutral planning document, as many academics and even some in uniform think it to be. Rather it was ... intended to serve five primary purposes."
Communicate the Executive's strategic vision to Congress, and thus legitimize its requests for resources.
Communicate the Executive's strategic vision to foreign constituencies, especially governments not on the US's summit agenda.
Communicate with select domestic audiences, such as political supporters seeking Presidential recognition of their issues, and those who hope to see a coherent and farsighted strategy they could support.
Create internal consensus on foreign and defense policy within the executive branch.
Contribute to the overall agenda of the President, both in terms of substance and messaging.
Where the incoming executive team has not formulated a national security strategy, such as an after an election in which foreign policy and defense were not important campaign issues, the process of writing the report can be of immense importance:
Few things educate new political appointees faster as to their own strategic sensings, or to the qualities and competencies of the "permanent" government they lead within executive bureaucracies, than to have to commit in writing to the President their plans for the future and how they can be integrated, coordinated and otherwise shared with other agencies and departments. The ability to forge consensus among these competing views on direction, priorities and pace, and getting "on board" important players three political levels down from the president is recognized as an invaluable, if not totally daunting, opportunity for a new administration.
History
2002 NSS
The National Security Strategy issued on September 17, 2002, contained the controversial Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war. It also contains the notion of military pre-eminence that was reflected in a Department of Defense paper of 1992, "Defense Policy Guidance", prepared by two principal authors (Paul Wolfowitz and I. Lewis Libby) working under then US Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. The NSS 2002 also repeats and re-emphasizes past initiatives aimed at providing substantial foreign aid to countries that are moving towards Western-style democracy, with the "ambitious and specific target" of "doubl[ing] the size of the world's poorest economies within a decade."
The Bush doctrine emerges in the context of moving from the old Cold War doctrine of deterrence to a pro-active attempt to adjust policy to the realities of the current situation where the threat is just as likely to come from a terrorist group such as al-Qaeda as from a nation state such as Iraq or Iran.
The document also treats AIDS as a threat to national security, promising substantial efforts to combat its spread and devastating effects.
2006 NSS
2010 NSS
On May 26, 2010, President Barack Obama. issued a new Strategy which was called by United Nations ambassador Susan Rice a "dramatic departure" from its predecessor. The Strategy advocated increased engagement with Russia, China and India. The Strategy also identified nuclear non-proliferation and climate change as priorities, while noting that the United States's security depended on reviving its economy. The drafters of the new Strategy made a conscious decision to remove terms such as "Islamic radicalism", instead speaking of terrorism generally.
The 2010 NSS said that in order to defeat al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, the United States needs to engage in a large amount of interagency cooperation and communication with the Muslim population in Afghanistan and throughout the world. The objective of the National Security Strategy is to create a stable situation for the world, including those countries struggling with insurgencies. "The most effective long-term measure for conflict and resolution is the promotion of democracy and economic development." In order to promote democracy and economic development communication with the civilian population of the host-nation is essential. The Stability Operations Field Manual states that success depends on a U.S. ability to build local institutions and in the establishment of a legitimate permanent government, which builds trust between the citizens and the counterinsurgency personnel." The National Security Strategy establishes the interagency coordination in order to conduct useful public diplomacy to secure the population in the countries of Afghanistan and Iraq.
2015 NSS
On February 6, 2015, Obama issued a new NSS to provide "a vision and strategy for advancing the nation's interests, universal values, and a rules-based international order through strong and sustainable American leadership."
2017 NSS
The primary author of the 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) was Nadia Schadlow, then-deputy national security adviser. Her work on the document and the inter-agency process that preceded it were well-received by foreign policy experts across the political spectrum. Delivered by President Donald Trump on December 18, 2017, the new document named China and Russia as "revisionist powers" while removing "climate change" as a national threat. It also characterized the world as a competitive arena rather than a "community of nations" or "international community" as previous documents had. NSS-2017 represents a break with past foreign policy doctrine. Brad Patty, an author for the conservative think tank Security Studies Group writes that, "My guess is that members of the Foreign Policy elite will encounter these first pages as a kind of boilerplate, even trite. Notice, though, that those two pages lead directly to a third page that repudiates the whole living body of American foreign policy thought."
About a year later, Schadlow would comment that the NSS had "achieved the state of mattering".
2021 NSS
In March 2021, President Joe Biden published the 2021 Interim National Security Strategy (NSS), which recommitted the United States to the NATO alliance and outlined the country's global priorities, concluding that the United States "must demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people. It will not happen by accident – we have to defend our democracy, strengthen it and renew it."

Tranylcypromine, sold under the brand name Parnate among others, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, tranylcypromine acts as nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It is used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent in the clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, respectively.
Tranylcypromine is a propylamine formed from the cyclization of amphetamine's side chain; therefore, it is classified as a substituted amphetamine.
Medical uses
Tranylcypromine is used to treat major depressive disorder, including atypical depression, especially when there is an anxiety component, typically as a second-line treatment. It is also used in depression that is not responsive to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, such as the SSRIs, TCAs, or bupropion.
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that tranylcypromine is significantly more effective in the treatment of depression than placebo and has efficacy over placebo similar to that of other antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants.
Contraindications
Contraindications include:
Porphyria
Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease
Pheochromocytoma
Tyramine, found in several foods, is metabolized by MAO. Ingestion and absorption of tyramine causes extensive release of norepinephrine, which can rapidly increase blood pressure to the point of causing hypertensive crisis.
Concomitant use of serotonin-enhancing drugs, including SSRIs, serotonergic TCAs, dextromethorphan, and meperidine may cause serotonin syndrome.
Concomitant use of MRAs, including fenfluramine, amphetamine, and pseudoephedrine may cause toxicity via serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis.
L-DOPA given without carbidopa may cause hypertensive crisis.
Dietary restrictions
Tyramine is a common component in many foods, and is normally rapidly metabolized by MAO-A. Individuals not taking MAOIs may consume at least 2 grams of tyramine in a meal and not experience an increase in blood pressure, whereas those taking MAOIs such as tranylcypromine may experience a sharp increase in blood pressure following consumption of as little as 10 mg of tyramine, which can lead to hypertensive crisis.
Foods containing tyramine include aged cheeses, cured meats, tofu and certain red wines. Some, such as yeast extracts, contain enough tyramine to be potentially fatal in a single serving. Spoiled food is also likely to contain dangerous levels of tyramine.
Adverse effects
Incidence of adverse effects
Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include:
Dizziness secondary to orthostatic hypotension (17%)
Common (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include:
Tachycardia (5–10%)
Hypomania (7%)
Paresthesia (5%)
Weight loss (2%)
Confusion (2%)
Dry mouth (2%)
Sexual function disorders (2%)
Hypertension (1–2 hours after ingestion) (2%)
Rash (2%)
Urinary retention (2%)
Other (unknown incidence) adverse effects include:
Increased/decreased appetite
Blood dyscrasias
Chest pain
Diarrhea
Edema
Hallucinations
Hyperreflexia
Insomnia
Jaundice
Leg cramps
Myalgia
Palpitations
Sensation of cold
Suicidal ideation
Tremor
Of note, there has not been found to be a correlation between sex and age below 65 regarding incidence of adverse effects.
Tranylcypromine is not associated with weight gain and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the hydrazine MAOIs.
It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to anesthesia; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension. The use of indirect sympathomimetic drugs or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as meperidine or dextromethorphan poses a risk for hypertension and serotonin syndrome respectively; alternative agents are recommended. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for CYP2A6 and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations.
Tranylcypromine abuse has been reported at doses ranging from 120 to 600 mg per day. It is thought that higher doses have more amphetamine-like effects and abuse is promoted by the fast onset and short half-life of tranylcypromine.
Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation.
Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects.
Interactions
In addition to contraindicated concomitant medications, tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6, which may reduce the metabolism and increase the toxicity of substrates of this enzyme, such as:
Dexmedetomidine
nicotine
TSNAs (found in cured tobacco products, including cigarettes)
Valproate
Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors prevent neuronal uptake of tyramine and may reduce its pressor effects.
Pharmacology
Pharmacodynamics
Tranylcypromine acts as a nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Regarding the isoforms of monoamine oxidase, it shows slight preference for the MAOB isoenzyme over MAOA. This leads to an increase in the availability of monoamines, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, epinephrine as well as a marked increase in the availability of trace amines, such as tryptamine, octopamine, and phenethylamine. The clinical relevance of increased trace amine availability is unclear.
It may also act as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor at higher therapeutic doses. Compared to amphetamine, tranylcypromine shows low potency as a dopamine releasing agent, with even weaker potency for norepinephrine and serotonin release.
Tranylcypromine has also been shown to inhibit the histone demethylase, BHC110/LSD1. Tranylcypromine inhibits this enzyme with an IC50 < 2 μM, thus acting as a small molecule inhibitor of histone demethylation with an effect to derepress the transcriptional activity of BHC110/LSD1 target genes. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown.
Tranylcypromine has been found to inhibit CYP46A1 at nanomolar concentrations. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown.
Pharmacokinetics
Tranylcypromine reaches its maximum concentration (tmax) within 1–2 hours. After a 20 mg dose, plasma concentrations reach at most 50-200 ng/mL. While its half-life is only about 2 hours, its pharmacodynamic effects last several days to weeks due to irreversible inhibition of MAO.
Metabolites of tranylcypromine include 4-hydroxytranylcypromine, N-acetyltranylcypromine, and N-acetyl-4-hydroxytranylcypromine, which are less potent MAO inhibitors than tranylcypromine itself. Amphetamine was once thought to be a metabolite of tranylcypromine, but has not been shown to be.
Tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6 at therapeutic concentrations.
Chemistry
Synthesis
History
Tranylcypromine was originally developed as an analog of amphetamine. Although it was first synthesized in 1948, its MAOI action was not discovered until 1959. Precisely because tranylcypromine was not, like isoniazid and iproniazid, a hydrazine derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable therapeutic index than previous MAOIs.
The drug was introduced by Smith, Kline and French in the United Kingdom in 1960, and approved in the United States in 1961. It was withdrawn from the market in February 1964 due to a number of patient deaths involving hypertensive crises with intracranial bleeding. However, it was reintroduced later that year with more limited indications and specific warnings of the risks.
Research
Tranylcypromine is known to inhibit LSD1, an enzyme that selectively demethylates two lysines found on histone H3. Genes promoted downstream of LSD1 are involved in cancer cell growth and metastasis, and several tumor cells express high levels of LSD1. Tranylcypromine analogues with more potent and selective LSD1 inhibitory activity are being researched in the potential treatment of cancers.
Tranylcypromine may have neuroprotective properties applicable to the treatment of Parkinson's disease, similar to the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. As of 2017, only one clinical trial in Parkinsonian patients has been conducted, which found some improvement initially and only slight worsening of symptoms after a 1.5 year followup.

Zig-Zag! was a revue staged at the London Hippodrome, London during World War I. It was devised by Albert de Courville, Wal Pink and George Arnold, with music by Dave Stamper (with arrangements and orchestrations by the musical director, Julian Jones), lyrics by Gene Buck, and additional songs by George M. Cohan. The revue opened on 31 January 1917 starring George Robey, Daphne Pollard, Cicely Debenham, Shirley Kellogg, Marie Spink and Bertram Wallis. It ran for 648 performances.
Robey interpolated a sketch into the show based on his music hall character "The Prehistoric Man", with Pollard playing the role of "She of the Tireless Tongue". In another scene, he played a drunken gentleman who had accidentally secured the box at the Savoy Theatre instead of an intended hotel room. The audience appeared unresponsive to the character, so he changed it mid-performance to that of a naive Yorkshire man. The change provoked much amusement, and it became one of the most popular scenes of the show. Zig-Zag ran for 648 performances.
During the later half of the war, revues and musical comedies were in great demand; other London hits running at the same time included The Bing Boys Are Here (also starring Robey, who left that show to join Zig-Zag!), Chu Chin Chow, Theodore & Co, The Happy Day, The Maid of the Mountains, The Boy and Yes, Uncle!. The audiences, which included soldiers on leave, wanted light and uplifting entertainment during the war, and these shows delivered it.

Robert B. Dome (October 12, 1905 - January 18, 1996) was an American electrical engineer credited with inventing frequency interlace color television modulation, which was compatible with existing black and white television sets.
Dome received his BSEE in 1926 from Purdue University, and worked for General Electric in Syracuse, New York. He also invented techniques for audio transmission, and received the 1951 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award "for many technical contributions to the profession, but notably his contributions to the inter-carrier sound system of television reception, wide band phase shift networks, and various simplifying innovations in FM receiver circuits." He was also a licensed radio amateur and a respected technical contributor to that community as W2WAM and may have held other call signs at other times (help needed).

Kimberly A. Prather is an American scientist who is an Atmospheric Chemist, Distinguished Chair in Atmospheric Chemistry, and a Distinguished Professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego. Her work focuses on how humans are influencing the atmosphere and climate. In 2019, she was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for technologies that transformed understanding of aerosols and their impacts on air quality, climate, and human health. In 2020, she was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. She is also an elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Education and early career
Prather was born in Santa Rosa, California. She studied at Santa Rosa Junior College and University of California, Davis, earning a Bachelor's degree in 1985 and a PhD in 1990. She served as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley between 1990 and 1992, working with Nobel Laureate Yuan T. Lee. Prather joined University of California, Riverside as an Assistant Professor in 1992. During her time at UC Riverside she began to work on aerosol mass spectrometry, developing ways to make it compact and transportable. She patented the technology.
Research
In 2001, Prather joined the faculty at the University of California, San Diego as a member of the Dept. of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Prather's early research focused on determining the major sources of fine particle pollution in California as well as in the Northeastern United States. As part of this research, she explored methods to distinguish between different aerosol sources based on their single particle composition and size. She developed aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS), a technique with high temporal and size resolution. In 1999 she began to work with the University of Rochester studying the health effects of ultrafine particles. She refined the detection technique so that it would precisely measure the size and composition of small particles. The ultrafine ATOFMS was able to examine exhaust particles from gasoline and diesel powered vehicles. She found that alongside the freeway, particles between 50 and 300 nm were mainly due to heavy-duty vehicles (51%) and light-duty vehicles (32%). She used the ultrafine ATOFMS to study atmospheric composition, combining it with ozone and NOx measurements. ATOFMS is now widely used in atmospheric studies around the world.
In 2003, she joined the advisory board of the United States Environmental Protection Agency PM2.5 Clean Air. Between 2003 and 2006 Prather studied whether ATOFMS could be used to measure the carbonaceous components of aerosols (including PAHs) and help to understand atmospheric processes, distinguishing between organic (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). Prather showed it was possible to distinguish EC and OC on a single particle level, and investigated their chemical associations with ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate. Her group explored ways to calibrate the ATOFMS data, making real-time apportionment of ambient particles possible. They did this by classifying particles using an artificial neural network (ART-2a). In 2008 she became the co-lead scientist in CalWater in collaboration with F. Martin Ralph; a multi-year interdisciplinary research effort focusing on how aerosols are impacting the water supply in the West Coast of the United States. Her PhD student Kerri Pratt led the Ice in Clouds Experiment - Layer Clouds (ICE-L) study. ICE-L included the first aircraft ATOFMS, named Shirley. Pratt and Prather studied ice crystals in situ on high speed aircraft flying above Wyoming, and found that the particles were mainly composed of dust or biological particles (bacteria, fungal spores or plants). Understanding the composition of airborne particles is imperative to properly evaluate their impact on climate change, as well as provide insight into how aerosol impact cloud formation and precipitation.
In 2010 she became the founding Director of the NSF Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment (CAICE). The CAICE was made a National Science Foundation Phase II Center for Chemical Innovation in 2013. In this role, Prather develops new analytical techniques for studying aerosol chemistry. Her group demonstrated that dust and aerosols in the Sahara can influence precipitation in Western United States. Prather studies the microbes that rise from the ocean, become airborne and contribute to the global temperature. Ocean-in-the lab experiments are conducted by storing thousands of gallons of seawater from the Pacific Ocean, producing waves, and adding nutrients to induce the growth of microbes. As part of CAICE, her group was the first to identify the major factors controlling chemical composition of sea spray, finding that the characteristics depended on the physical forces and ocean biology of the waves. They demonstrated two types of droplets; "film" drops that were full of microbes and organic materials, and "jet" drops that mainly contained sea salt and other biological species. Prather's research team can explore the impact of carbon dioxide on the global temperature by controlling the amount entering their ocean simulation chamber. The Scripps Ocean Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS) will open in 2020 and allow the study of how wind, temperature, sunlight and pollution impact the ocean. The funding was extended by the National Science Foundation in 2018, with a second $20 million grant allowing them to investigate the interaction of human pollution with ocean-produced gases and aerosols.

Pain Necessary to Know is the third studio album by the Italian avant-garde metal band Ephel Duath. The album was observed to be another departure for the band, with Ciaran Tracey noting in Terrorizer that "its sheer difference in the hugely tangential path Ephel Duath have taken from everything done hitherto, even in terms of their own varied and colourful palette". Tracey further observed that the band's previous "multiple personality disorder seems to have been replaced by a bipolar schizophrenia, with the numerous faces of past work having been cast aside in favour of two basic protagonists: explosive rage and light jazz".
Cosmo Lee similarly remarked in Stylus Magazine that
Reception
Ciaran Tracey commented in Terrorizer that the album was "at times wholly random in its obtuse jazz meandering and violently extreme ejaculations" yet it "perfectly conjures the fug, the smell and the bleeding of saturated colour into black sky that makes our nocturnal city lives the unsavoury and sometimes downright dangerous places they are".

The Max Euwe Memorial Tournament was an annual international invitation chess tournament played in honour of Max Euwe (1901–1981) from 1987 to 1996. It was played in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (with the exception of 1990 when it was played in Rotterdam). In 1976, while Euwe was still alive, a jubilee tournament was held which can be seen as a prequel of the series.
From 1987 to 1996, ten consecutive Euwe Memorial editions were held. The event was usually played as a mini-tournament in a double round-robin of four top players from the absolute world elite with the exception of the fifth edition in 1991 and the tenth edition in 1996 inviting ten players in a single round robin. If there was a tie on top, there was no play-off.
The last edition of the principal Memorial series was organized in 1996, mainly because the main sponsor Verenigde Spaarbank (VSB) lost its interest.
In addition, there was later a moderate strong and independent "Euwe Stimulans" tournament, played at Arnhem in 2007, Amon Simutowe from Zambia won, completing his final GM norm in the process to become a chess grandmaster. Also at that event, which had a line-up of ten players, Fridrik Olafsson played a famous game against Vincent Rothuis.
The Ideal Max Euwe International Tournament in São Paulo 2008 was subclaimed as "2nd Euwe Stimulans" Tournament. This ten-player round robin featured three players from Brazil plus seven players from other countries. Zhao Zong Yuan and Gilberto Milos were shared winners, ahead of clear third John van der Wiel.
A next Max Euwe Memorial commemorating the former World Chess Champion and President of FIDE who died 26 November 1981 took place in Amsterdam on 13–20 November 2011. Aside from various events (i.e. simultaneous exhibitions), a men's and a women's four-player double round robin was held which was won by (then 13-time Dutch Women's Champion) Zhaoqin Peng in Group 1, while Robin van Kampen took the honours in Group 2.

Nechkinsky National Park () is an important biological and cultural reserve of Udmurtia (the Udmurt Republic), situated in the middle valley of the Kama River, its tributary the Siva River, and the coastal part of the Votkinsk reservoir. This places Nechkinsky on the western side of the central Ural Mountains. The territory is mostly forest and river floodplains, with a number of ancient archaeological sites on the grounds. It is near the city of Izhevsk.
Topography
The park covers a forested valley of the watershed of the Siva River, a tributary of the Kama. The valley is about 110–160 meters deep, and 3–20 km wide. It is asymmetrical, in that the left bank is flat, and the right bank is steep hillside. The Kama River at this point has a wide floodplain, with several fluvial terraces at higher levels.
Ecoregion and climate
The ecoregion of Nechkinsky is Sarmatic mixed forests (WWF ID#436). This ecoregion is a strip of low forests, lakes and wetlands, running from the Baltic Sea east to the Urals. Forest cover is typically mixed conifer and deciduous trees, with large unbroken tracts under pressure from agriculture.
The climate of Nechkinsky is Humid continental climate, warm summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Average temperatures range from 10 F in January to 66 F in July. Annual precipitation averages 20 inches.
Plants
The forest communities are a mixture of taiga, mixed forests and steppe-forests. On the lower levels there are oligotrophic and mesotrophic bogs. In the gullies and depressions there are Siberian spruce and associated species. On both the left and right banks of the Siva River there are pine forests, with some stands of silver fir and Siberian larch. In the lower levels the forest cover is broadleaf (oak) communities, with secondary cover of birch and aspen. The park records 712 species of vascular plants, representing 70% of the species found in Udmurtia. The wetlands of the Siva include the Kemulskoye bog (2 thousand hectares).
Animals
A census of species in the park in 2002 recorded 50 mammals, 191 birds, 5 reptiles, 8 amphibians, 37 fish. Special studies of were done of mollusks (33 species), spiders (120 species), beetles (600 species), butterflies (500 species) and dragonflies (25 species). Rare species include the vulnerable Russian desman, a semi-aquatic large mole that looks like a muskrat and is under protection because of historical trapping for its fur.
History
Early settlements sites of ancient hunters and fishers (3rd - 2nd millennium BCE) have been excavated in the park. The earliest identifiable archaeological sites are the remains of fortified Iron Age settlements from the first millennium BCE, associated with the Ananyino culture. The Ananyino were an early Finno-Ugric languages people.
Tourism
There are several educational trails developed around ecological themes of a particular habitat or geological type; park employees are available as guides on these trails. The park has one long developed hiking trail (Tourist route "Dear Ancestors", 25 km) that has four rest areas along the route, two observation decks for views of the reservoir, and passages along old trails used by peasants in former times. There are two access points for bathing in the Kama River. There are also two ski trails and five auto routes (for which written passes must be obtained from the forest administration office.

Elin Ekblom Bak (born 5 June 1981) is a Swedish football midfielder, currently playing for Elitettan club Älta IF. She previously played for teams including Tyresö FF in Sweden's Damallsvenskan.
She also works as a scientist, publishing research in the British Journal of Sports Medicine which posited that sedentary behaviour such as sitting at a desk is harmful even for people who exercise regularly.
Ekblom Bak made her senior Sweden debut on 1 February 2004, in a 3–1 win over Canada.
She signed a professional contract with Espanyol in Spain, but rules prevented her from playing League matches, only in Cup and non competitive games. Ekblom Bak engaged sports lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont to make a legal challenge on her behalf and the rules eventually changed, but disgruntled Ekblom Bak had already decided to leave.

The Boeing NLA, or New Large Airplane, was a 1990s concept for an all-new quadjet airliner in the 500+ seat market. Somewhat larger than the 747, this aircraft was similar in concept to the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 and later Airbus A380. In 1993, Boeing chose not to pursue development of this concept, focusing instead on the Boeing 747-500X and -600X, and then on the 747X and 747X Stretch, and subsequently on the Boeing 747-8. The project names for this aircraft were NLA and Boeing 763-246C.

History
The Boeing New Large Airplane was one of several projects started by Boeing in the late 20th century as a way to compete with rival aircraft corporations like Airbus. The Airbus A380 project began to be publicized in 1990 in order to try and turn the commercial aviation market away from the then very prevalent Boeing 747. Boeing sought to combat this and began working up designs for the NLA at some point in the early 1990s, with a scheduled service entry date of before 2000 in order to beat Airbus to the punch.
The goal of the NLA project was to create an airplane capable of traveling primarily long-haul routes and carrying vast amounts of passengers or cargo. At the time of design, twinjet aircraft were not considered suitable for transpacific flights, so the NLA was designed with a four-jet layout (two on each wing), much like the 747 or A380. Long-haul flights such as Sydney to Dubai or London to New York can take anywhere from 8 to 14 hours. The four engines would help provide the power necessary to make these long trips safely. Because the project was designed with the goal of beating competitors based on sheer passenger volume, the NLA was designed with a full-length two deck configuration. This would allow for 600–1000 passengers (depending on airline and class seating configurations), about 50 more passengers than the A380 per configuration.
However, after only a few years of working on the project, Boeing decided that the NLA model was unsustainable with the way the commercial aviation market was trending. Instead of larger, higher capacity aircraft with the ability to make long hub-to-hub routes in a single go, Boeing decided the future was in smaller, more direct flights. As a result, they cancelled the NLA project to focus on 747 expansion models.

Transformation
Between 2003 and 2007, the school went under a major transformation. This has produced a number of new buildings within the school grounds which include a sports hall, a drama studio, bistro and dining room. The school was celebrated with a re-dedication ceremony presided by Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex.
MUGA Redevelopment
On 15 March 2016, a new 3G Pitch was officially opened by the Liverpool F.C. player Kolo Touré, Liverpool L.F.C. Alex Greenwood and former Everton F.C. legend Graeme Sharp. The 54m x 43m 3G pitch replaced a concrete Multi-Use Games Area (MUGA). The new pitch was funded by a £269,093 grant from the Premier League and The FA Facilities Fund with the pitch costing £339,092 in total. The redevelopment of the pitch also included the provision of floodlights that allow the pitch to be used at night.
Sixth Form
The school operates the International Baccalaureate, which has been available at the school since 1992.
From September 2022, DBA will switch their Sixth Form Courses to A-Level.
Sports
Broadgreen have been successful in sport over the last few years. Games such as football, basketball, hockey, and rugby have been played. The school offer sports for disabled, deaf, and blind children as well, such as boccia and curling, which they won both in 2017 (boccia and curling), and 2018 (boccia).
Ofsted Report
Between 11–12 December 2018, Ofsted carried out an inspection of the school's teaching standards and learning facilities. In its report of 5 February 2019, Ofsted found that the school was ‘inadequate' and that special measures were required to improve standards.

Typhoon Saomai, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Juan, was considered the most powerful typhoon on record to strike the east coast of the People's Republic of China. It was the eighth tropical storm, fifth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season recognized by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, Saomai was the seventh tropical storm and fifth typhoon of the season. The name "Saomai" was submitted by Vietnam, and is from the Vietnamese word for "morning star" (sao Mai), a reference to the planet Venus.
The typhoon brought heavy rain and wind to areas of the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the east coast of China. It was responsible for 456 deaths and $2.5 billion (2006 USD) in damage. Saomai affected many of the same areas affected by Tropical Storm Bilis a month earlier, and the China Meteorological Administration reported that Saomai was the strongest typhoon that ever occurred over China's offshore region as well as the most powerful typhoon ever to make landfall over Mainland China.
Meteorological history
A tropical disturbance formed east of Chuuk on July 31 and gradually increased in organization over the next several days as it moved northwestward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on August 4 and it was designated a tropical depression by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later that day. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 5, and the JMA designated it Tropical Storm Saomai.
Saomai continued moving toward the northwest and passed over the Mariana Islands on August 6 while continuing to strengthen, and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of PAGASA on August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Due to Saomai's proximity to Tropical Storm Bopha, located near Taiwan, the two underwent a Fujiwhara interaction. This interaction served to shift Saomai's track slightly to the south and provided the system with in influx of moisture via southwesterly monsoonal flow on the backside of Bopha.
Late on August 9, Saomai reached its peak intensity as it moved just north of Miyakojima. The JMA estimated it to have attained winds of and a central pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; ). The JTWC estimated Saomai to have been a much more powerful system, ranking it as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute winds of and a pressure of 898 mbar (hPa; ). Further, though less significant, discrepancies on the peak intensity of Saomai exist between the local warning centers for China. Both the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) estimated the typhoon to have been slightly stronger, stating peak ten-minute sustained winds of and , respectively. Similarly the agencies reported lower pressures: 915 mbar (hPa; ) by the CMA and 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHG) by the HKO.
After passing to the south of Okinawa, Saomai turned westward and brushed the northern coast of Taiwan Island early on August 10. The typhoon maintained its minimum pressure until it approached within of the eastern China coast. On August 10, Typhoon Saomai made landfall at Cangnan County in southern Zhejiang, still maintaining a small and clear eye. According to the CMA, the typhoon moved ashore with maximum sustained winds of , and a central pressure of . By winds, Saomai tied Typhoon Marge in 1973 for the strongest typhoon to strike mainland China; because Saomai had a lower landfall pressure than Marge, the CMA considered it the strongest typhoon on record to strike the nation, as well as a 1 in 100 year typhoon. Saomai was therefore the strongest typhoon to strike Zhejiang, surpassing the previous record held by typhoons Rananim in 2004 and Typhoon Khanun in 2005. However, wind estimates for typhoons could be inaccurate for early typhoons. Gradual weakening ensued as Saomai moved further inland, and it weakened into a tropical depression on August 11, dissipating later that day.
Preparations
The United States National Weather Service issued a tropical storm warning for Guam as Tropical Storm Saomai approached the island on August 6. Military bases in northern Guam entered Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 1, meaning that winds of 50 knots or higher were expected within 12 hours. The rest of the island was placed under Condition of Readiness 2, meaning that such winds were possible within 24 hours. Several bases were temporarily closed.
The Central Weather Bureau of the Republic of China issued land and marine typhoon warnings for areas of northern Taiwan in anticipation of Saomai's outer bands. The warnings had been upgraded from lesser warnings issued for Tropical Storm Bopha, which made landfall in southern Taiwan the day before. Five flights in and around Taiwan were canceled, as was ferry service. Hundreds of flights from Okinawa to the rest of Japan were also canceled.
In China, 1,001,000 people in Zhejiang and 710,000 people in Fujian were evacuated to shelters prior to Saomai's landfall. Over 20,000 soldiers and police were mobilized to aid in cleanup and rescue efforts. Officials ordered 10,286 ships with 35,282 fishermen to return to port in Fujian, while another 5,638 ships returned to port in Zhejiang. Also in Fujian, all 26,800 schools were closed. The Wenzhou city government ordered all businesses to close and prepare for the storm. Airlines canceled 25 flights from Fuzhou Changle International Airport and another 17 from Hong Kong, while ferry service was also disrupted. During the storm, the Wenzhou Longwan International Airport closed, stranding hundreds of travelers.
Impact
During the overnight hours of August 5–6, Tropical Storm Saomai moved through the southern Mariana Islands with its center passing halfway between Guam and Rota. Owing to the storm's relatively quick pace, its effects were limited in duration. Rota received the strongest winds, with gusts peaking at at the International Airport while sustained values reached . Lesser winds occurred on Guam, with a peak gust of measured at Andersen Air Force Base. Enhanced winds extended northward to Tinian and Saipan. Light to moderate rains accompanied the storm and accumulations were generally less than ; however, monsoonal flow along the south side of Saomai enhanced totals over Guam where fell. Only minor damage resulted from the storm's passage, limited to downed trees and power lines on Guam. Brief electrical outages occurred in Barrigada and Chalan Pago. Overall, damage in the region was estimated at $5,000.
Later, as with Tropical Storm Bilis a month earlier, Saomai's outer rainbands affected areas of the Philippines. Over 400 homes were destroyed by storm surge, and two people were killed. At least seven people were reported missing.
The core of the typhoon passed to the north of Taiwan, but the island still experienced heavy rain and wind that disrupted traffic and cancelled flights to and from Taipei. No serious damage or casualties were reported.
While in the vicinity of Okinawa, Saomai brushed the southern Ryukyu Islands. Miyakojima reported the heaviest rainfall in Japan, totaling . Wind gusts in the region peaked at at Shimoji-shima. Waves of in height were reported at Miyakojima, which caused ¥980,000 (JPY, $8,500 USD) in road damage.
Mainland China
Saomai was the third in a series of deadly storms that struck China in the summer of 2006, after Tropical Storm Bilis in July killed over 600 people and Typhoon Prapiroon killed around 80 people in early August. It was also the sixth tropical cyclone of the year to strike the country. While moving ashore in Zhejiang province, Saomai produced high waves, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall. Cangnan County in Wenzhou reported of precipitation in only one hour, and 300 mm (11.8 in) over 12 hours. Rainfall reached in the inland province of Jiangxi, with recorded in one hour in Linchuan District. The storm broke several wind records in eastern China. A station in Cangnan County reported peak winds of , and a station in Fuding reported winds of , which were the strongest winds on record in Zhejiang and Fujian, respectively. The latter value was slightly less than the wind report in Hong Kong during Typhoon Wanda in 1962. Fuding city reported gusts of over for about three hours, and widespread areas in Zhejiang and Fujian reported typhoon force winds, with a diameter of winds.
Along its path, Saomai destroyed about 54,000 buildings while causing widespread power outages. There were 61,277 destroyed rooms and another 371,147 that were damaged, mostly in Fujian. Most of the damaged houses along the path were generally masonry built, while newer towers fared better due to higher building standards. The typhoon also damaged of farmlands, mostly in Jiangxi. Saomai struck a less developed area of China, which limited insured damage to around ¥400–500 million (RMB, $50.5–63 million USD). This was estimated to have been between 4–9% of the overall damage. Damage was estimated at ¥11.66 billion (RMB, $1.5 billion). Overall, Saomai killed at least 441 people, although unofficial sources suggest a death toll of around 1,000.
The storm left nearly all of Zhejiang without power and cut half of all communication links. The heavy damage prompted officials to declare a state of emergency. In Wenzhou alone, over 18,000 homes were destroyed, and 3,850 factories were forced to shut down. Also in Wenzhou, Saomai left over 213,000 people without clean water. 193 people died in the city. In Cangnan County, the typhoon damaged 450 schools, totaling ¥25 million (RMB, US$3.1 million). Rainfall across the state flooded 56 provincial roads and highways. Six people died in Lishui after being crushed by a landslide. Throughout Zhejiang, economic losses totaled ¥4.9 billion (RMB, $610 million), of which ¥4.5 billion (RMB, $560 million) was in Wenzhou.
In Fujian, high waves in Fuding wrecked about 1,000 ships, killing hundreds of fishermen. Most of the lost ships were in the village of Shacheng, where about half of the residents were left homeless. Some entire villages in Fujian were entirely swept away by the winds and rains. High winds and rainfall destroyed 32,700 houses, including 10,000 in Fuding alone; there were also 80,000 damaged houses in the city. Economic losses reached ¥3.1 billion (RMB, US$388 million), and about 200 people died in Fuding. Also in the city, Saomai destroyed the roof tiles and the gate house of the 1,146 year old Ziguo temple, a local historical site. The monks in the temple had evacuated, and damage to the structure was estimated ¥5 million (RMB, US$625,000), rendering it largely destroyed. Damage in Fuzhou, also in Fujian, totaled ¥200 million (RMB, US$25 million). Province-wide, 234 factories or mines were forced to shut down due to the typhoon. Economic losses in Fujian totaled ¥6.4 billion (RMB, US$795 million).
About a month after Typhoon Kaemi affected the region, Saomai caused additional flooding in the inland province of Jiangxi. There, the storm wrecked six reservoirs, resulting in ¥348 million (RMB, US$45 million) in damage. About 35,000 people were forced to evacuate in Jiangxi due to the storm. One person was washed away in floodwaters while inspecting damage, while another person was killed when a damaged building collapsed. In neighboring Anhui province, flooding forced residents to evacuate homes.
87 deaths were reported in Zhejiang, mostly in Wenzhou. Major highways in the province were flooded out. Most of these deaths were caused by storm surge flooding in coastal fishing communities, such as Fuding. Eight of the deaths were caused by the collapse of a damaged evacuation shelter. Strong winds and flooding destroyed 37,000 houses and flooded 380 km2 (94,000 acres) of farmland, and economic damage amounted to 6.3 billion yuan.
Aftermath
Immediately after Saomai made landfall in China, local Red Cross chapters provided residents left homeless with emergency supplies, such as blankets, clothing, medicine, and disinfectant. After the storm moved ashore, the Wenzhou government blocked street access to the areas with the heaviest damage. Officials ordered stores to cease selling items that were unrelated to storm recovery. By 11 days after landfall, 80% of the factories in Wenzhou had reopened. The city of Fuding provided ¥104.9 million (RMB, US$13.2 million) toward reconstructing, as well as ¥5,000 (RMB, US$625) for each family.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies made an appeal for almost 6 million Swiss francs ($4.8 million, 2006 USD) to assist stricken families in the PRC. As of August 11, 2006, about 1.8 million Chinese yuan ($220,000) worth of relief items and financial assistance had been given to the victims. The PRC government also allocated 120 million yuan ($15.2 million) for disaster relief in areas affected by Saomai and earlier storms. The funds were used to provide food and water for displaced victims and pay for the rebuilding effort in Zhejiang and Fujian.
Retirement
After the season ended, members of the 39th meeting of the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization met in Manila in December 2006. They discussed retiring the name "Saomai", along with four other names from the season. During the 40th meeting in November 2007, the Typhoon Committee approved the retirement, announcing that the name "Son Tinh" would replace Saomai on the basin name lists beginning in 2008 and was first used in the 2012 season.

Stryker Louis Trahan (pronounced ; born April 25, 1994) is an American professional baseball outfielder who is a free agent. The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Trahan in the first round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft out of Acadiana High School in Scott, Louisiana, as a catcher, and shifted him to the outfield in 2014.
Career
Trahan played baseball on travel teams in Louisiana as a catcher. He attended Acadiana High School in Scott, Louisiana, where he played for his school's baseball team. He had a .460 batting average as a junior, and batted .384 as a senior, being named to the Class 5A All-State first team in both his junior and senior years. He participated in baseball showcases for high school players. He also played quarterback and tight end for the school's American football team, which won the state championship. He was honored as All-District as a quarterback in his senior year. He committed to attend the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) to play college baseball for the Ole Miss Rebels baseball team.
The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Trahan in the first round, with the 26th overall selection, of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft. Rather than enroll at Ole Miss, Trahan signed with the Diamondbacks, receiving a $1.7 million signing bonus. Though the Diamondbacks kept him at catcher, they foresaw the potential need to take him off of the position and play him in the outfield. He made his professional debut that year in the Rookie-level Arizona League, where he batted .281 with a .422 on-base percentage and a .473 slugging percentage. He began 2013 in extended spring training, before he was assigned to the Missoula Osprey of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. He batted .254 with ten home runs and a .462 slugging percentage with Missoula.
Before the 2014 season, the Diamondbacks shifted Trahan to play as a left fielder. He opened the season with the South Bend Silver Hawks of the Class A Midwest League. After batting .198 and striking out in 36% of his plate appearances, the Diamondbacks demoted Trahan to the Hillsboro Hops of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League in July. Trahan homered for Hillsboro in the opening game of the 2014 Northwest League championship series, won by the Hops. In 2015, playing catcher for most of the season, he played for Hillsboro Hops, moved up to Kane County Cougars, and ended the season with Visalia Rawhide. He started the 2016 season back with Visalia Rawhide moving to RF Position.
The Diamondbacks released Trahan in March 2017.
Personal
Trahan was named for the title character in B.L. Stryker. His parents, Donna and Chad, were both catchers for the Acadiana softball and baseball teams, respectively. Donna was also named to the all-state team. Donna died of liver cancer in April 2013. Trahan is married as of November 2015.

Samuel Ian Russell (born 4 October 1982) is an English football coach and former professional footballer.
As a player he was a goalkeeper from 2000 until 2021. He began his career in the Premier League with Middlesbrough although he failed to make a first team appearance but would notably go on to have three spells with Darlington between 2002 and 2012. He also played for Gateshead, Scunthorpe United, Rochdale, Wrexham and Forest Green Rovers before joining Grimsby in 2018 where he combined playing duties as James McKeown's number two with coaching the clubs goalkeepers.
Playing career
Middlesbrough
Russell was born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire and signed as a professional on 7 July 2000 for his hometown team after progressing through their youth system. He had a successful loan spell at Gateshead during the tail end of the 2001–02 season, followed by a brief period at Darlington on loan in 2002 after Mick Tait brought him in during a keeping crisis. He played in only one game, a 1–1 draw against Torquay United.
In August 2003 he was sent to Scunthorpe United on loan where he stayed for three months and made 10 appearances. He finally left Middlesbrough in the summer of 2004, moving to Darlington on a permanent basis. He never appeared in Middlesbrough's first team.
Darlington
He was brought to Darlington by David Hodgson in August 2004. With the retirement of goalkeeping legend Andy Collett, the club only had two goalkeepers on their books in Michael Price and youth team player Jack Norton. Russell was a target for Hodgson after he heard that Middlesbrough were releasing the youngster. Initially it was thought Russell would be number two to Price, but performances during pre-season meant that Russell got the nod. Assistant manager Mark Proctor said that both Price and Russell were of virtual equal quality but Russsell's distribution was slightly better.
In the opening game of the 2004–05 season Russell made his mark with a superb performance which earned him the man of the match. His superb saves kept Darlington in the game and meant Darlington hung on to an opening day victory. He was ever-present in the first team in the 2004–05 season, and signed a new two-year contract in July 2005.
He seemed to have established himself as the number one until just before the start of the 2007–08 season until failed to agree terms with then manager Dave Penny and Russell left to go to Rochdale and left Darlington in June 2007 after three years in which he made 107 league appearances.
Rochdale
In July 2007 he signed for Rochdale, making his first start for the club in the Football League Trophy second round tie against Bury in October 2007. Following an injury to regular keeper James Spencer, Russell was next called upon in the FA Cup defeat at Southend United. He retained his place in the side and in December 2007, signed a contract until the end of the season having been on non-contract terms. He broke a finger in the 2–1 defeat at Lincoln City in February 2008 and was expected to be out of action until April.
In the 2008–09 season Russell was handed the number one shirt for Rochdale. He had made some important saves for Rochdale that season, however he made the occasional mistake, such as scoring an own goal in the Rochdale–Bury derby, and slipping in a late equaliser by Jamie Ward against Chesterfield despite a Tom Kennedy late winner. In February he was replaced by Blackburn loanee Frank Fielding after Spencer was loaned out to Chester City.
Wrexham
After being released by Rochdale at the end of the season, Russell signed for Conference National side Wrexham after impressing on trial.
Return to Darlington
In May 2010 he agreed to rejoin Darlington on a one-year contract. He became their regular goalkeeper, and played at Wembley as they beat Mansfield Town to win the FA Trophy. He signed a one-year contract extension, but when the club suffered financial difficulties and failed to pay the players, he submitted his 14-day notice at the end of December and left the club for fellow Conference club Forest Green Rovers in January 2012.
Forest Green Rovers
Russell made his Forest Green debut on 21 January 2012 in a 0–0 draw against Newport County. In his first eight Forest Green performances he saved four consecutive penalty kicks. He made his hundredth league appearance for the club in a 2–1 win over Grimsby Town on 18 March 2014. In March 2014, he signed a contract extension to remain with the club.
A run of 144 consecutive league appearances for Forest Green was brought to an end on 21 February 2015 when he was replaced by Steve Arnold for a 3–0 win over AFC Telford United. On 4 May 2015, it was announced that he was leaving Forest Green after his contract had come to an end.
Gateshead
In June 2015, Russell joined National League side Gateshead, returning to a club where over a decade earlier he had spent time on loan.
Return to Forest Green Rovers
On 1 July 2016, it was announced that Russell had returned to former club Forest Green Rovers on a two-year deal. He made his 150th league appearance for the club in a 4–1 away win over Maidstone United on 27 August 2016. Between 17 September 2016 and 29 October 2016, he kept a run of seven National League clean sheets, until Oliver Hawkins header in a 1–1 draw with Dagenham & Redbridge saw him concede and narrowly miss out on the league record of eight consecutive clean sheets set by Alan Julian for Stevenage.
Russell appeared in every single of minute of Forest Green's 2016-17 campaign, as he helped the club secure promotion to the Football League for the first time in their history with a 3-1 National League play-off final win against Tranmere Rovers at Wembley Stadium. He was rewarded with a new one-year contract in June 2017 for Forest Green's first season in League Two.
He was released by Forest Green at the end of the 2017–18 season.
Coaching career
Grimsby Town
On 9 July 2018 he joined Grimsby Town as the club's new player / goalkeeper coach.
Russell retired from playing at the end of the 2020–21 season but remained Paul Hurst's first team goalkeeping coach. On 25 June 2022, Russell announced via his Twitter account that he was leaving Grimsby.

Emile School or Emile High School was a segregated high school for African-American students in Bastrop, Texas. A part of the Bastrop Independent School District, it opened in 1893. The school, named after the book Emile, or On Education, housed grades 1-12. The lion was the school's mascot.
According to the website of Emile Elementary School the building was a two-story structure on a plot of land in an African-American area of Bastrop. The lower grades were in four classrooms on the first floor and the upper grades were in two classrooms on the second floor. In the late 1940s a new building opened, and it received brick additions about a decade later. Due to racial integration, it closed in 1969, with students going to Bastrop High School. The building was repurposed for grades 4–5; originally it had a new name, but it was reconfigured to be a grade K-5 school by 1988, when it returned to being named "Emile".

Rafael Aguilar Talamantes (October 24, 1939 in Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur – July 17, 2016 in Ciudad de México, México) was a Mexican politician.
Talamantes graduated from the National School of Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico () (UNAM) in 1962 where he attended from 1958. He returned to UNAM in 1971 to the National School of Law where he attended until 1976, leaving without completing his degree. Originally a member of the Mexican Communist Party, he became a political prisoner in 1966 apprehended in the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo in Michoacán on October 8 of that year. Talamantes was imprisoned on charges of property damage to the nation.
CNAO foundation
In 1970, Talamantes was released from prison due to the law of social dissolution being repealed by then president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, many other student protesters were among those released. Aguilar soon after left the Mexican Communist Party, claiming the party had done nothing to get him out of prison. Talamantes along with other prominent members of the student movement, as well as members of the Marxist leftist movement, the Movement of National Liberation () (MLN), formed the Comité Nacional de Auscultación y Organización (CNAO) in 1971. The organization however suffered a split between those that wanted to adopt Marxism–Leninism ideology and those that wanted to adopt a party language more in line with what they felt was the voice of the Mexican people. Demetrio Vallejo and Heberto Castillo split to form the Mexican Workers' Party () (PMT), Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, along with Graco Ramírez, formed the Socialist Workers' Party () PST.
Partido Socialista de los Trabajadores
The PST was founded as a Marxist political party that believed in the expropriation of financial institutions and many industries, also believing management of state enterprises should be handled by the workers and peasants. The PST secured registration in 1978 and in the following year it was given proportional representation seats, continuing to win 9-12 seats the following periods in 1982 and '85. In 1987 the PST split again as Graco Ramírez was expelled from the party, often cited as differences over the direction the party was taking. In 1988, after having served as the party Secretary General from 1975 to '76 and President from 79-87, the party was renamed to the Party of the Cardenist Front of National Reconstruction () (PFCRN). In 1987 the PFCRN allied itself with the National Democratic Front, which supported the candidacy of Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas Solórzano, a former PRI member who had left the party and was running for the presidency supported by a large number of leftist parties and organizations. Cárdenas lost the election to PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari, it is believed after massive election fraud. After the elections of 1988, Aguilar Talamantes separated from the FDN, and the PFCRN supported many of the policies of the ex-president Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In 1988 the party proportional representation in Congress rose from 12 seats to 41.
In the elections of 1994 Aguilar Talamantes was the PFCRN candidate to the Presidency, but obtained only 0.85% of the vote, with which it was in sixth place. His party lost its official recognition, recovered it as the Cardenist Party in 1997, but that same year would lose its registry definitively.
At the moment, Aguilar Talamantes one has seen near the Socialdemocratic Party (formerly known as Social Democratic Alternative Party), he supported the candidacy of Patricia Mercado in the presidential elections of the 2006.

Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 351 U.S. 115 (1956) and 367 U.S. 1 (1961), was a federal court case in the United States involving the compelled registration of the Communist Party of the United States, under a statute requiring that all organizations determined to be directed or controlled by the "world Communist movement" publicly disclose detailed information as to their officers, funds, and membership.
The case resulted in two opinions from the Supreme Court of the United States, the second of which upheld the constitutionality of the registration requirement against challenges brought under the First and Fifth Amendments.
Background
In 1950, the United States Congress passed the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950. Its findings read, in part:
There exists a world Communist movement which, in its origins, its development, and its present practice, is a world-wide revolutionary movement whose purpose it is, by treachery, deceit, infiltration into other groups (governmental and otherwise), espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship in the countries throughout the world through the medium of a world-wide Communist organization.
The Act required any organization qualifying as either a "communist-action" organization or a "communist-front" organization to register with the Attorney General of the United States and provided detailed information about their operations, including offices, finances, printing presses, names and addresses of officers, and in the case of "communist-action" organizations—those determined to be "substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement...and...[that] operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement—names and addresses of members. This registry was to be updated annually by the organization, kept available to the public by the Attorney General, and be the basis for an annual report by the Attorney General to Congress.
The Act also established the Subversive Activities Control Board, and empowered the Attorney General of the United States to petition the Board for an order that an organization register that was required to but had not done so. The Board was empowered to examine evidence, and to compel witnesses to appear before it and testify or produce documents. Review of the Board's determinations were to be reviewed in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Board and lower court proceedings
On November 22, 1950, the Attorney General petitioned the Subversive Activities Control Board for an order to require that the Communist Party of the United States register as a Communist-action organization. The Party filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and though a three-judge panel denied a preliminary injunction, it issued a stay of Board proceedings pending appeal. After the Supreme Court denied a petition for extension of the stay, the Party abandoned its lawsuit.
The Board conducted hearings regarding the Party from April 23, 1951 through July 1, 1952. After hearing testimony from twenty-two witnesses for the Attorney General and three for the Party, and reviewing 507 exhibits, the Board issued a 137-page report finding the Party was a "Communist-action" and ordering that it register.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals denied the Party's motion for leave to adduce additional evidence, which the Party had alleged would show that three witnesses for the Attorney General had committed perjury before the Board, and affirmed the Board's order.
The Supreme Court's first decision
Though the Party challenged the constitutionality of the Act, the Supreme Court did not address these issues in its opinion, delivered by Justice Felix Frankfurter. The majority found that the Attorney General had failed to deny the perjury allegations. It concluded that because the testimony of the three witness was not insubstantial, the record had been impugned and therefore the Board's order could not stand. The Court remanded the case to the Board "to make certain that (it) bases its findings upon untainted evidence."
Three justices dissented in an opinion by Justice Tom C. Clark, criticizing the Court for employing a "pretext," in order to avoid deciding the core issues that were before it.
Proceedings on remand
On remand, the Board denied several motions filed by the Party seeking to introduce additional evidence. The Court of Appeals also denied a motion by the party for leave to adduce additional evidence, but granted the Board permission to consider a motion by the Party regarding another of the Attorney General's witnesses who had also allegedly committed perjury. The Board granted the Party's motion, reopened the hearings, and the witness was recalled and crossexamined.
On December 18, 1956, the Board issued its 240-page Modified Report, finding that the recalled witness was credible but expunging the testimony of the other three challenged witnesses. Making new findings of fact, the Modified Report reaffirmed the Board's conclusion that the Party was a "Communist-action" organization and recommended that the Court of Appeals affirm its registration order. The Court of Appeals, however, remanded for the further production of documents regarding the recalled witness's testimony.
The hearings were reopened, further documents were produced, and the Board struck additional testimony though not to the extent that the Party requested. The Board then issued its Modified Report on Second Remand, with findings of fact largely consisting of the findings contained in its first Modified Report, and again concluding that the Communist Party of the United States was a Communist-action organization, and again recommending that its order to register be affirmed. The same panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the order and denied the Party's motion for further discovery.
The Supreme Court's second decision
In an opinion again delivered by Justice Frankfurter, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act's registration requirements.
First, the Court rejected the argument that the Act was an unconstitutional bill of attainder. The registration requirement did not target organizations, but was predicated upon certain conduct. Second, the Court rejected the arguments that the registration requirement violated the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment. Though noting that registration requirements may be invalidated on First Amendment grounds and had been by the Court in prior cases, the Court stated that the present case was different because of the seriousness of the threat that international Communism posed. The Court would not question Congress's findings regarding that threat, and would not reject its methods of dealing with it just because they might choose different methods.
Third, the Court deemed the Party's challenge under the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination premature. The Party claimed that admitting being an officer of the Party was recognized as incriminating, and that its officers would invoke the privilege, but the Court found this speculative and noted that its officers had been a matter of public record rather than a secret. Fourth and finally, the Court rejected the Party's due process challenge that Congress's findings of a "world Communist movement" predetermined facts that should be left for adjudication. The determination that a particular organization was required to register was left to be litigated, and "[t]hat is all due process requires."
Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas each authored dissents, all of which each joined as well.

Camillo di Pietro J.U.D. (10 January 1806 – 6 March 1884) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and both Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals and later Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church.
Biography
Camillo di Pietro was born in Rome. His father's family was one of merchants of the countryside that became rich and entered the patriciate of Terni and Spoleto; his mother was from the Dukes of Sermoneta, who were eminent members of the Roman aristocracy and descendants of Pope Boniface VIII. He was the second of the four children of Domenico di Pietro and Faustina Caetani. He was a nephew of Michele di Pietro, who served as Cardinal and Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem.
He was educated at the Collegio Romano in Rome where he studied the humanities and philosophy. He entered the Seminario Romano where he studied theology and finally the Collegio di Protonotari Apostolici, Rome where he received a doctorate utroque iuris (in both canon and civil law) on 10 May 1829. He received the subdiaconate on 19 May 1839 and the diaconate on 2 June 1839.
He entered the priesthood as domestic prelate on 15 January 1829. He served as Prelate adjunct of the Congregation of the Tridentine Council from 1829 until 1832. He was created Protonotary apostolic. On 13 December 1830, he pronounced, before the cardinals gathered for the conclave, the oration for Pope Pius VIII. He was appointed as Apostolic delegate in Orvieto in 1832, and in Spoleto from 1834 until 1835. Pope Gregory XVI recalled him to Rome and named him Auditor of the Sacred Roman Rota on 6 April 1835. He was confirmed in his post by motu proprio of 27 April 1835. He took the oath on 16 November 1835 and entered the office on the following 23 November. He resigned the post on 19 August 1839. He was ordained to the priesthood on 16 June 1839.
He was appointed titular archbishop of Berut by Pope Gregory XVI on 8 July 1839. He served as Nuncio to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from 1839. He was appointed as Internuncio extraordinary and apostolic delegate to Portugal on 29 June 1844.
He was created Cardinal-Priest of San Giovanni a Porta Latina by Pope Pius IX in the consistory of 19 December 1853 and reserved in pectore. It was published in the consistory of 16 June 1856. He was appointed President of the Supreme Council of Public Affairs on 10 August 1859. He was appointed to the office of Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Signatura on 29 August 1863 to 1867. Pope Pius appointed him as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals on 8 January 1866. He opted for the order of cardinal bishops, taking the suburbicarian see of Albano on 20 September 1867. When the vacancy in the suburbicarian see of Porto-Santa-Rufina opened he took that see also on 12 March 1877. He was elected as Vice-dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He played an essential role in its organisation and obtained the necessary guarantees from the Italian government not to interfere with the conclave of 1878 when Pius IX died. It was the first conclave after the Holy See had lost the Papal States. He participated in the conclave of 1878 that elected Pope Leo XIII. Pope Leo appointed him as Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church on 28 March 1878, and he held the post until his death. He opted for the suburbicarian see of Ostia on 15 July 1878 and thus was the Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He died in Rome in 1884 and is buried in the Campo Verano cemetery.

The dark-throated oriole (Oriolus xanthonotus) is a species of bird in the family Oriolidae.
It is found in Southeast Asia through Borneo and the Philippines. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests where it is threatened by habitat loss.
Taxonomy and systematics
The dark-throated oriole is sometimes considered forming a superspecies with the Philippine oriole and the Isabela oriole. Alternate names for the dark-throated oriole include the black-headed oriole, black-throated oriole and Malaysian oriole. The alternate name 'black-headed oriole' should not be confused with the species of the same name, Oriolus larvatus.
Subspecies
Four subspecies are recognized:
O. x. xanthonotus - Horsfield, 1821: Found on the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and south-western Borneo
Mentawai dark-throated oriole (O. x. mentawi) - Chasen & Kloss, 1926: Found on the Mentawai Islands archipelago off the west coast of Sumatra, in Indonesia.
O. x. consobrinus - Ramsay, RGW, 1880: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Borneo and offlying islets
O. x. persuasus - Bangs, 1922: Found in south-western Philippines

Paṇḍita Jagannātha Samrāṭ (1652–1744) was an Indian astronomer and mathematician who served in the court of Jai Singh II of Amber, and was also his guru.
Jagannātha, whose father's name was Gaṇeśa, and grandfather's Viṭṭhala was from a Vedic family originally from Maharashtra.
At the suggestion of Jai Singh, he learned Arabic and Persian, in order to study Islamic astronomy. Having become proficient in these languages, he translated texts in these languages into Sanskrit. These translations include:
Rekhā-gaṇita, a translation of Euclid's Elements made from Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's Arabic recension of the same. For this work, he had to coin more than a hundred Sanskrit mathematical terms
Siddhānta-sāra-kaustubha, a translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's Arabic version
His original works include:
‍ Siddhānta-samrāṭ, which describes astronomical instruments, their design and construction, and observations. It also describes the use of these observations in correcting parameters and preparing almanacs. It mentions how J‌ai Singh, who earlier used astronomical instruments (such as the astrolabe) made of metal, later switched to huge outdoor observatories (such as the Jantar Mantar), as they were more precise; also they were made of stone and mortar rather than brick, to diminish the effects of wear-and-tear and climate.
Yantra-prakāra, which describes astronomical instruments, measurements, computations, etc. in more detail, and also observations made by him.
Jagannātha held that when theory and observation differed, observation was the true pramāṇa and overruled theory. While he used and described a number of astronomical instruments, telescopes were not one of them.

The Mysterious Monsters (also known as Bigfoot: The Mysterious Monster) is a 1976 documentary film written and directed by Robert Guenette about the cryptids Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and the Yeti. It contained content from Guenette's made-for-TV movie Monsters! Mysteries or Myths? that aired on CBS on November 25, 1974. That version had been produced by David L. Wolper in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and was narrated by Rod Serling.
The Mysterious Monsters was one of the first theatrical releases produced by Sunn Classic Pictures. It was narrated by actor Peter Graves. The film investigated not only the possibility of Bigfoot's existence but also of the Loch Ness Monster and the Yeti (the Abominable Snowman). It featured dramatic reenactments of various reported Bigfoot sightings. The film showed one witness being given a lie detector test, another being placed under hypnosis. The Mysterious Monsters was the first movie to feature the home movie taken by Roger Patterson in 1967 reported showing a Bigfoot. Anthropologist Grover Krantz was interviewed and said he believed the film to be authentic. Famed Bigfoot hunter Peter Byrne was also featured and gave insights on the hunt. In discussing the Loch Ness Monster, the film showed a 1934 photograph that was said to be of the creature. In 1994, however, this photo was proven to be a hoax.
Robert and Frances Guenette are credited as the authors of a 160-page book adaption of the film.
The film was later featured in an episode of Cinema Insomnia.
DVD release
On September 22, 2009, Cheezy Flicks released the film on DVD. In 2010, Apprehensive Films made the Cinema Insomnia version available also on DVD. The DVD cover is a visual reference to the 1978 Marvel Star Wars comic Star Wars 13: Day of the Dragon Lords.

The HKL Class M100 is the first and oldest class of metro trains in use on the Helsinki Metro. One train consists of two individually numbered cars. A total of 42 car pairs (84 cars in total) were manufactured between 1977 and 1984.
Up to six pairs can be combined into a 12-car train formation, however due to the relatively short length of the platforms (especially on the new Länsimetro extension), at most only two pairs (giving a 4-car formation per train; and prior to the Länsimetro opening in 2017 three pairs resulting in 6-car formations could also be seen during rush hour) can be combined for passenger service. Longer combinations are used in maintenance operations. Any Helsinki metro train types can be combined mechanically, such as for towing.
The first three units (cars 101–106) were constructed as prototypes in 1977 and have some minor technical differences compared to the later units. The prototype units are no longer in active use.
The M100 trains underwent its first round of refurbishment in 2004–2009, at the Talgo Oy (now Škoda Transtech) rolling stock works at Otanmäki. In 2017, the City Council of Helsinki decided to refurbish class M100, class M200 and class M300 trains in order to extend their lifetime for another 10 years. The renovation will start in late 2019 and will be completed by government-owned VR FleetCare. It is planned to delay acquiring new metro trains for the potential automation of the metro system, due to the decision to cancel the contract to automate the Helsinki Metro in 2015. The prototype trains (101–106) will not be renovated.
Accidents and incidents
On 27 July 2016, M100 carriage no. 157 was involved in an accident with M300 carriage no. 302 when the latter derailed near Itäkeskus metro station during testing.

New York (1776) was a gunboat (also known as a Gundalow) built in 1776 at Skenesboro, New York. It was originally called prior to launch for service in General Benedict Arnold's fleet on Lake Champlain. New York may be named after the City of New York, because other ships in the fleet were named after cities, however, it could be named after the State of New York, because at least one or two other ships, and , sometimes referred to as New Jersey, were named after states.
Design
The exact dimensions of New York are not known, but her sister ship , which is preserved and on display at the National Museum of American History, in Washington, D.C., are and would probably be very close to the same. Philadelphia is long and wide with a draft of .
She was armed with one 12-pounder long gun mounted in the bow, two 9-pounder guns, and eight swivel guns. New York had a crew of 45 men.
Battle of Valcour Island
In the Battle of Valcour Island the American fleet had: eight gundalows, four row galleys, one sloop, and two schooners. The British Fleet had: one square-rigged ship, one Ketch-radeau, two schooners, one gundalow and 28 gunboats.
During the battle, it may have been captained by a Captain Lee, or may have been turned over to a Capt. Reed when Lee, probably due to illness, was unable to sail with General Arnold's little fleet as it got under way from Crown Point 24 August.
New York accompanied the flotilla up the lake, stopped at Willsborough 1 September to repair damage suffered during a severe storm and was at Isle La Motte on the 18th. On the 23rd the American ships retired into a defensive position between Valcour Island and the New York shore to await the British Capt. Thomas Pringle, RN, got his ships under way 4 October.
A week later on the morning of 11 October, the two forces met in the Battle of Valcour Island which resulted in a tactical American defeat but was a great strategic victory for the patriots' cause. Battered during the action off Valcour Island, Arnold's ships slipped through the hands of the British fleet and retired south up the Lake toward Crown Point. About noon on the 13th, the British fleet pulled within range of the Americans and opened fire. Arnold's flotilla fought defiantly for over two hours before their shattered condition forced him to run his ships ashore in a little creek about 10 miles from Crown Point and burn them. With his men, he then retired through the woods to Crown Point.
During the battle, one of the three cannons exploded, killing Lieutenant Thomas Rogers.
But the little fleet had served the American cause well. Its presence on the lake had delayed the British drive from Canada to cut the American colonies in two, while the redcoats were building their own fleet. After the Battle of Valcour Island, winter was too close to permit them to begin the campaign. Thus New York and her plucky little sister ships had bought the Americans a year to prepare for the onslaught, a year which made possible their stirring victory at Saratoga.
New York was the only gunboat to survive the battle, along with 6 other gundalows,4 galleys, and 2 sloops. New York was later stationed at Fort Ticonderoga and fell during the July 1777 siege.
In 1910, the stem of New York was unearthed and can be found at the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum in Vergennes, Vermont.

Toyen, formed in Autumn of 1988, officially started in March of said year. The project's title pays homage to Czech painter, Toyen.
Three of the four founding members of the act were originally apart of a previous project 'Letadlo. Which was banned from further performing by the Czech Communist regime in the early 1980s - With Toyen, therefore forming only shortly after the Velvet Revolution. All though the band's compositions were predominantly in Czech, the pieces were occasionally performed in English.
MembersPetr Chromovsky – lead vocal, rhythmic guitar & keyboardIvo Heger (composer) – lead guitarPetr Vaclavek (lyricist) – bass guitarJiri Simecek (founding member/graphic designer) – percussion
Conversing with Industry Professionals
Scott Murphy of 'US-NYC' and marketing supervisor at ABC-TV, witnessed the act's performances while frequenting Prague clubs/music events. With Murphy eventually deciding to collaborate with the group in preparation for their first US tour. Starting production of their first 'EP'; "The Following - The Disappeared Rail-Roads". The single of the peace appearing seemingly successful amongst Czech charts. The compositions were characterized as; "mid-tempo, blues rooted, granting feelings of nostalgia with charming melodies and sophisticated elements of guitar". The physical copies of the EP featured a cover with photography by Tono Stano - and is supposedly still considered a "collectible rarity".
Members of Toyen were also able to converse with 'Paul King' of, MTV's 120 Minutes (UK), at a music competition in Bregenz. With King consequently deciding to feature live-footage of the band in Prague, amongst video by 'David Ondricek', in an episode of 120 Minutes.
International Acknowledgements
Toyen started their US tour at the Broadway club, The Shooting Gallery. With a following performance at CBGB.
Czech label, 'Sony Music - Bonton' - subsequently signing a record agreement with the band. Allowing the studio-production of their follow-up album; "Last Free Swans!". Which was written in collaboration with producer Colin Stuart and featured lyrics by London's, Matt Black. This album supposedly featured a; "stronger psychedelic/groovy vibe", in comparison to the act's previous release. The album's cover-art lead to the act's Czech equivalent of a, 'Grammy Nomination'.
Toyen were invited to England and Wales to perform the 'Open-Air Summer Festival in Cardiff. As well as invited to do a performance in Austria the same year.
British electronic act, Depeche Mode took Toyen on as a support-act for the Prague performance of their 'Devotion Tour, in 1993.
Future Achievements/Ambitions
Lead-guitarist, Ivo Heger leaves the act in the years following their US tour, supposedly causing 'grief' amongst fans. Heger going on to create his own project; 'The Way', as Toyen signed a new agreement with 'BMG CZ'.
Scott Murphy has prepared a new US tour for the act, respective of their new agreement. Replacing their guitarist with original member; Jiri Simecek. All though Simecek supposedly did not hold compositional abilities on par with Heger, the issue seemingly had little to no effect on Toyen's continuation.
Toyen prepared a new album "Blue Painter" (or "Malíř Smutnej" in Czech), for 'BMG CZ'. Which was produced in collaboration with Jan P. Muchow.
Hiatus/Retirement
Křivka announced his retiral after Toyen's second US tour ("Blue Painter"s promotional tour), with his replacement, František Sahula.
Toyen released their last album with new guitarist, Petr Vana; "La Orana"''', in 1997 - under an independent CZ label. It featured new compositions in English, in attempt to cater toward a Western audience (like their earlier live-performances). The last two tracks of the album paying homage to original member Heger, featuring his guitar/keyboard.
When Šimeček was made aware of "La Orana"'' being the project's last album, he attempted to conclude it with a spoken-word track about Toyen's history. This however did not come to fruition.
The band's last performances were held in their hometown, each with an unfortunate declining attendance. Ondříček produced a movie about Toyen, which aired on Czech TV, in 1997.

Trimble County is a county located in the north central part of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Its county seat is Bedford. The county was founded in 1837 and is named for Robert Trimble. Trimble is no longer a prohibition or dry county. Trimble County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY–IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.9%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in Kentucky by land area and fourth-smallest by total area. The county's western border with Indiana is formed by the Ohio River.
The county is largely divided into two by a central roughly north–south ridge; to the east of which lie the Little Kentucky River and Daughtery, Buck, and Carmen Creeks; and to the west of which lie Spring, Corn, Middle, Patton's and Barebone Creeks, tributaries of the Ohio River.

About 10.00% of families and 13.60% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.70% of those under age 18 and 16.80% of those age 65 or over.
Locales
Trimble county comprises two major towns, a couple of hamlets, and various small settlements.
The 1877 Collins county history identified the towns of Bedford, Milton, Kingston, and Palmyra.
Later authorities have differed from this.
The town of Bedford at the junction of United States Highways 421 and 42 is the county seat but was not its largest town until the middle 20th century.
Its environs include Callis Grove, to the north, the site of an open-air tabernacle and campgrounds built by a Methodist church, retaining the name of the old Callis Grove post office run by Robert Edward Callis from June 1893 to September 1894 at the junction of what is now U.S. highway 42 and New Hope Road; and Bedford Springs, a set of springs popular before the U.S. Civil War.
The largest town until then was the port town of Milton, which was also the oldest town, at the junction of U.S. Highway 421 and Kentucky Route 36 and across the Ohio River from Madison, Indiana.
It is widely believed that it used to have the name "Kingston" but in fact Kingston was a nearby, and not as old, village that Milton subsumed by an act of the Kentucky General Assembly in March 1872.
In its vicinity are such things as Lookout Point and the erstwhile farm of Delia Webster.
Wise's Landing was a thriving port town in the 19th century that has dwindled down to a hamlet, whose identity is intermingled with Corn Creek, the name of one of the county's creeks that the Landing served and also (confusingly) the name of the Wise's Landing post office and thus the name given to the town on many maps over the years.
It is at the mouth of Barebones Creek whose headwaters lie at Bedford and one of whose forks are Pryors Fork, sometimes identified on maps by its post office Trimble.
Their collective environs include Payne Hollow, Preston Hollow (and an erstwhile Preston Plantation), and Spring Creek.
The rest of the county was in the 19th century a wide number of very small settlements, characterized as "just 'store-school-church' crossroads" by geographer Nancy Demaree.
Before the school system was centralized and the advent of Rural Free Delivery in the 20th century there were twenty-odd post offices and a similar number of little schools throughout the county.
In the view of Robert M. Rennick, who made a lifetime study of places in Kentucky, outwith the incorporated cities of Bedford and Milton only four more places with post offices have qualified as viable villages.
They are Wises Landing and Corn Creek, counting as two for this purpose despite their historic conflation, Abbott/Abbotsford, which also may not actually have been separate places, and Providence.
It isn't known where exactly the Abbotsford post office, and the two later post offices named Abbot, actually were, as the location reports on the forms that were submitted by their postmasters to the government are subject to interpretation.
Abbotsford post office from the name was at a "ford" somewhere on the Little Kentucky River, or possibly another watercourse, in the store and hotel of postmaster James Abbot.
The first Abbot post office (1880-08-02 to June 1883) was in postmaster Madison Dunn's home north of the Little Kentucky River.
The second Abbot post office (1886-04-06 to August 1906) was originally to be named Abbots Ford, but "Ford" was crossed out on the form, and was (according to postmaster William R. Morgan) one mile to the north-east of Middle Creek, five miles to the east of the Ohio River, and five miles south of Bedford.
This is roughly the location of the name "Abbott" that is shown on 20th century state highway maps, although that is south-south-west of Bedford and west of the Little Kentucky River.
Robert M. Rennick characterized 19th century Ewingford as "a couple of stores and a sawmill at a ford", and 20th century Ewingford as "a small restaurant and a couple of dozen homes".
Providence used to be a village, purportedly with the original name "Hammels' Store" if the post office submission form for Hammel post office (1890-04-28 to February 1903) by storekeeper George M. Hammel is to be believed.
It was actually identified on maps as Hammel until World War One, after which it was apparently renamed Providence after a local Baptist church.
The 1847 Collins county history identies Palmyra as a village with a store and a post office, however this is contradicted by records that show no Palmyra post office and only a post office named Winona at the location, later established by one James M. Turner on 1851-01-21.
(The 1877 Collins history instead names Winona post office.)
It could not have been called Palmyra as that would have clashed with an existing Palmyra postoffice in Simpson County.
Nor was Palmyra the same as Vail, which actually was another post office whose lifetime overlapped that of Palmyra.
Vail was rather the precursor of the post office named Monitor, so renamed because after an attempt to reëstablish it in 1903 after a hiatus, it, too, then clashed with an existing postoffice with an almost identical name in another county.

The Gravesend Town Pier is located in Gravesend, Kent. It was designed by William Tierney Clark and built in 1834 on the site of the earlier Town Quay. Over 3 million passengers were served between 1835 and 1842, but around 1900, this pier fell into disuse due to the arrival of the railways.
In 2000, this site was restored by the Gravesham Borough Council, partly funded by the organisations English Heritage, English Partnerships, Heritage Lottery Fund, Kent County Council, and Manifold Trust. In 2002, this renovation project was finished. They had also added a restaurant and a bar to the pier. When reopened, the Gravesend Town Pier was initially successful, but it later became a fiscal failure.
Gravesend town pier is the oldest surviving cast iron pier in the world and is a Grade II* listed building.
Current services
Since 2012 the Gravesend–Tilbury Ferry has run from the Town Pier.
Mention of the pier in other media
It is the setting of the 2017 song "Gravesend Pier" by Gone Molly, which describes a scene of poverty and wealth in nineteenth century England.

José Francisco Chaves (June 27, 1833 – November 26, 1904) was a nineteenth-century military leader, politician, lawyer and rancher from the New Mexico Territory.
Biography
Family
José Francisco Chaves was born on June 27, 1833, in Los Padillas, New Mexico (then in the Departmento de Nuevo México of the United Mexican States) in what is now Bernalillo County, near Albuquerque, New Mexico. His father was Don Mariano Chaves and his mother Dolores Perea was the daughter of Don Pedro Jose Perea of Bernalillo. She later married Dr. Henry Connelly, who became Territorial New Mexico governor during the Civil War. José's father, Don Mariano Chaves, was chief of staff under Governor Manuel Armijo in the revolution of 1837 and inspector general of all the military forces of New Mexico. Don Mariano later served as pro-tem governor under Mexican rule in the absence of governor Armijo. José Francisco was a paternal grandson of Don Francisco Xavier Chávez, the first Governor (1822–1823) of the Departmento de Nuevo México under the independent First Mexican Empire shortly after Mexican War of Independence from Spain ended in 1821. José was also a first cousin of Francisco Perea and of Pedro Perea.
Related to the Chaves Family of Fall River in Massachusetts.
Early life
José Francisco Chaves attended schools in St. Louis, Missouri, studied medicine at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons and engaged in livestock raising in the New Mexico Territory. He married Mary Bowie in 1857, who died in 1874, leaving two children, Lola and Francesca. The former married Mariano Armijo, descendant of a prominent family of Bernalillo county, NM. The latter died in 1895.
Chaves served as a soldier in campaigns against the Navajos prior to the Civil War. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Governor Connelly commissioned Chaves as major when the 1st Regiment NM Volunteers for the Union Army formed. After Ceran St. Vrain resigned his commission with the 1st, Kit Carson was appointed colonel and Chaves was promoted to lt-colonel. In 1862 he took part in the Battle of Valverde. He was recognized for gallant and meritorious services, and later helped establish Fort Wingate, of which he was post commander for a long period. He was honorably mustered out of the service of the United States in 1865.
Chaves owned an Indigenous girl named Maria in 1860 to "mark his social wealth". It is likely that he abducted the thirteen-year-old girl either during a raid on an Indigenous community or by purchasing her at a rescate (auction). Chavez's mother and step-father owned as many as four enslaved Indigenous children.
Political career
Returning home he began the study of the law and in due course was admitted to the bar. In politics he was a staunch Republican and in 1858, while absent campaigning against the Navajos, was elected a member of the House of Representatives of the territorial legislative assembly, taking his seat in 1860. In 1865 he was elected delegate from the New Mexico Territory to the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the 39th and 40th Congresses from 1865 to 1867. He was elected back to the House of Representatives in 1868 and successfully contested the election of Charles P. Clever in 1869, serving again until 1871, being unsuccessful for reelection in 1870. In 1875, he was elected a member of the legislative council from Valencia County and was reelected to every succeeding legislature. Chaves was president of the New Mexico Territorial Council for eight sessions.
Chaves continued in farming and livestock raising. He was district attorney of the second judicial district from 1875 to 1877 and was a member and president of the New Mexico constitutional convention in 1889. He was New Mexico Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1903 to 1904 and was appointed New Mexico State Historian in 1903, but his career was cut short by an assassination in Pinoswells, New Mexico on November 26, 1904, where he was shot through a window while dining in the home of a friend. The identity of his assassin remains a mystery. He was interred in Santa Fe National Cemetery in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
His daughter, Dolores Elizabeth "Lola" Chávez de Armijo, is noted for her successful fight to keep her job as state librarian after Governor William C. McDonald attempted to remove her on the basis that she was a woman.

James Wellington Truran Jr. (born July 12, 1940, Brewster, New York – March 5, 2022) was an American physicist, known for his research in nuclear astrophysics.
Biography
Truran graduated in 1961 with a bachelor's degree from Cornell University. In 1966 he received his Ph.D. in physics from Yale University. His Ph.D. thesis entitled Thermonuclear reactions in supernova shock waves was supervised by Alastair Cameron. As a postdoc Truran was from 1965 to 1967 a research associate at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. At the physics department of Yeshiva University he was from 1967 to 1970 an assistant professor, from 1970 to 1972 an associate professor, and from 1972 to 1973 a full professor. For the academic year 1968–1969 he was a research fellow in physics at California Institute of Technology. From 1973 to 1991 he was a full professor of astronomy at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. For the academic year 1979–1980 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and held a visiting position at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. With the aid of a Humboldt Research Award he spent the academic year 1986–1987 at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. In 1991 he became a professor in the department of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, where he retired as professor emeritus.
He did important research on "novae, supernovae, nucleosynthesis, and galactic chemical evolution through the application of nuclear physics to astrophysics." His Ph.D. thesis and subsequent research led to accurate prediction of the production of the 56Ni in Type Ia supernovae. Radioactive decay of 56Ni through 56Co to 56Fe produces high-energy photons, which dominate the energy output of Type Ia supernova ejecta at intermediate to late times.
Truran's research includes s-processes in stars, carbon explosion models of Type Ia supernovae, and r-processes in metal-poor stars. He was involved in the development of the FLASH simulation code for thermonuclear supernova explosions.
He was elected in 1987 a fellow of the American Physical Society and in 1995 a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From 1985 to 1988 he was the vice president of the board of trustees of the Aspen Center for Physics.
Truran was a member of the AURA "HST and Beyond" Committee, which in 2017 received the Carl Sagan Memorial Award. He received in 2020 the Laboratory Astrophysics Prize of the American Astronomical Society's Laboratory Astrophysics Division (LAD) "for his theoretical work on early star formation and the nucleosynthesis history of the universe, as well as for his seminal contributions to the study of astrophysical thermonuclear explosions, nucleosynthesis, and the use of nuclear-decay chronometers to determine ages of stellar and terrestrial matter." He was awarded in 2021 the Hans A. Bethe Prize for "distinguished contributions across the breadth of nuclear astrophysics, Galactic chemical evolution and cosmochronology."
Upon his death he was survived by his widow, three daughters, four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

The maple leafblotch miner (Cameraria aceriella) is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Quebec and Ontario in Canada and Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New York, and Vermont in the United States.
The wingspan is 7–9 mm. Adults are on wing from the end of May to June.
The larvae feed on Acer species, including Acer rubrum and Acer saccharinum. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They mine into the parenchyma, just under the upper surface of the leaf. Later, they wrap silk around part of their mines to pupate. Part of the population overwinters in the larval form inside leaves that have fallen to the ground and pupate the following spring. The other part overwinters as pupae.
This species was first described by American entomologist James Brackenridge Clemens in 1859.

Henri Émile Hermand Malherbe, also known as Henry Malherbe or Henry Croisilles (4 February 1886 – 17 March 1958) was a French writer.
Life and career
Malherbe was born in Bucharest. In Paris he wrote for Le Temps, the magazine Excelsior, and later for La Revue des vivants, ("organe de la génération de la guerre"), of which he was co-director with Henry de Jouvenel.
Malherbe fought in the First World War. In 1919 he was a co-founder and first president of the . In 1953 the association established the Henry Malherbe Prize for essays in his honour.
In 1917 Malherbe won the Prix Goncourt for the novel La flamme au poing, (literally, "The Flame in the Fist", published in English translation in 1918 as The Flame that is France). In 1918 the reviewer in the magazine North American Review wrote:
Music
Malherbe took a particular interest in musical matters. His interview with Claude Debussy in 1911 is quoted extensively by the composer's biographer Léon Vallas; his criticisms of the Conservatoire de Paris for what he saw as its reactionary agenda and declining standards were reported in Britain and the US, in The Times and by Richard Aldrich, music critic of The New York Times. As a critic, Malherbe was less inclined than some of his colleagues to take new works at face value: he spotted, as many other critics did not, what he called "the heated eroticism" that lay below the seemingly "innocent neoclassical surface" of Francis Poulenc's 1924 ballet Les biches.
In his book about Bizet's Carmen, published in 1951, Malherbe offered what the journal Hommes et mondes called an analysis "of rare lucidity" of the origins, libretto and score of the opera, and presented hitherto unpublished information about the circumstances of the composer's early death; in this Malherbe raised the possibility that unhappy in love and in despair at "the conspiracy of critics who had condemned Carmen", Bizet may not have died of illness but had killed himself.
Malherbe's other books on music attracted some adverse comment from his contemporaries for his propensity to speculate about his subjects. His biography of Schubert (1949) was criticised in Music & Letters for "sketches circumstantially describing scenes for which we have not a shred of evidence. … M. Malherbe allows himself again and again to be carried away by his enthusiasm into writing bookstall fiction." His 1938 Richard Wagner révolutionnaire also suffered from some "rather fictitious" biography, according to the Revue De Musicologie.
Later years
Malherbes was appointed a Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur in April 1953. He died in Paris in 1958, at the age of 72.

The 1943–44 season was Stoke City's ninth season in the non-competitive War League.
In 1939 World War II was declared and the Football League was cancelled. In its place were formed War Leagues and cups, based on geographical lines rather than based on previous league placement. However, none of these were considered to be competitive football, and thus their records are not recognised by the Football League and thus not included in official records.
Season review
With the war now at its most demanding clubs had to rely on even more guest players and Stoke used the most players this season more than any other time during the war. With most senior players being called for military duty there was a largely youthful feel to Stoke squad for the 1943–44 season and it showed as they ended the first phase of the Football League North in an overall position of 34th (out of 50 teams) and in the second phase they finished in 13th. Freddie Steele hit an impressive 20 goals from just 9 matches including a double hat trick against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

The smoky robin (Peneothello cryptoleuca) is a species of bird in the family Petroicidae endemic to West Papua, Indonesia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
Described by German ornithologist, Ernst Hartert, in 1874, the smoky robin is a member of the Australian robin family Petroicidae. Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed this group in a Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines, including pardalotes, fairy-wrens, and honeyeaters, as well as crows. However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida, or "advanced" songbirds, within the songbird lineage.

Christopher Alexander "Alex" Haun (September 14, 1821 – December 11, 1861) was a potter from Greene County, Tennessee, regarded as one of the most notable and skilled of the antebellum period. During the American Civil War, he was executed by the Confederate States of America for participation in the East Tennessee bridge-burning conspiracy.
Haun was one of many examples in 19th century Tennessee of what were later referred to as family potters, rural potters who ran businesses, often part-time as a supplement to farming and with the aid of their families, supplying practical vessels for local use. Stephen T. Rogers of the Tennessee Historical Commission writes that Haun "produced some of the most beautiful and finely crafted lead-glazed earthenware in Tennessee". Haun and a number of potters lived in a part of Greene County referred to as Pottertown, using local clay found near Lick Creek. Pottertown was a staunchly Unionist enclave in a Confederate State.
Union supporter Reverend William Blount Carter launched a plan, with the approval of President Abraham Lincoln, to destroy Tennessee bridges in order to disrupt the Confederate railroad system. Haun and other local potters were recruited to destroy the bridge over Lick Creek. On November 8, 1861, after being sworn into Company F of the 2nd Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, they proceeded to the bridge and destroyed it. There they captured Confederate sentries and released them after they swore an oath to the union. The Confederate soldiers, however, informed the authorities and Haun and four others were captured. Haun and three of the others were hanged at the Knoxville, Tennessee jail on December 11.
Before he died, he wrote to his wife regarding the disposition of his pottery business and concluded:
I have the promise that my body will be sent home to you.
O live for heaven,
Oh my bosom friend and children,
Live for heaven I pray.
My time is almost out, dear friend, farewell to this world — farewell to earth and earthly troubles.

Venerable Macarius of the Yellow Water Lake and the Unzha, the Miracle Worker (1349–1444) (, Prepodobny Makariy Unzhenskiy Zheltovodskiy Chudotvorets) is a Russian Orthodox saint. He is credited with the founding of four monasteries in the Middle and Upper Volga regions of Russia.
The Life of Venerable Macarius
The story of saint Macarius is based on Chet'yi-Minei (the standard Russian Orthodox Lives of the Saints) as well as to other old manuscripts. One of them, kept in Makaryev Unzhensky Monastery, was first inventoried in 1835. The other is kept in Makaryev Zheltovodsky Convent, and is written in the 17th century hand.
Church scholars believe that he was most likely born in 1349. His home town, Nizhny Novgorod, was the capital of the Principality of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod, ruled by Prince Constantine Vasilyevich. As most other Russian principalities of the time, his land was dominated by the Golden Horde overlords.
Macarius was baptised in his parents' parish church, Church of Holy Myrrhbearers (). His baptismal name is not known.
According to the Life of St. Macarius, when he was still a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but eventually they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, because if they stayed at home during the service, the baby would again start crying.
Macarius grew as a pious boy, especially interested in the lives of the Orthodox hermits of the past ages, living in the wilderness alone or in small lavra communities. For that reason, he enjoyed visiting not only his parish church, but also Pechersky Ascension Monastery, which had been recently founded by Dionysius (later known as Saint Dionysius of Suzdal, the archbishop) who had come to Nizhny Novgorod from the famous Kiev Pechersky (Cave) Lavra. At the age of 12, he snuck out of his parents' house and joined te Pechersky Ascension Monastery, and received the monastic name of Macarius (, Makariy). He became one of the twelve disciples of Dionysius, and was known for the strictness of his fast and the fervency of his prayer.
In 1374, Dionysius was appointed the archbishop of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod and left the monastery. Soon, Macarius left the monastery too. He travelled up the Volga, spent some time with St. Tikhon on the Lukh River, and then founded a monastery in honor of Epiphany of Jesus Christ (now Makaryev Reshma Monastery, Макариев-Решемский мужской монастырь, near the village of Reshma in today's Kineshma district or Kostroma Oblast).
Macarius did not stay long in his new monastery, however. He wanted to live in the wilderness as a hermit. He travelled down the Volga, and liked the site at the Yellow Water Lake (Желтоводское озеро, Zheltovodskoe Ozero), near the fall of the Kerzhenets into the Volga, some one hundred kilometers downstream from Nizhny Novgorod. In those days, this was no-man's land between the Russian principalities, and the Kazan Khanate.
Macarius dug a small cave by the waters of the Yellow Water Lake, and stayed there day and night, emulating the great hermits of the past. However, his solitude did not last long: pious people from far and wide came to his hermitage, some to seek his blessing, others to join him in hermetic life. In 1434, he founded Zheltovodsky Makariev Monastery of Holy Trinity for his disciples.
The asceticism of Macarius, together with his love of his neighbors, attracted not only Christians but also many local pagan Mordvin, Mari, Chuvash and Muslim Tatar people. He baptised many in Yellow Water Lake.
In 1439, the monastery was destroyed during the invasion of Russia by the khan Olug Moxammat of Kazan. Most of the monks were killed; Macarius and a few other Christians were taken to Kazan as prisoners. The khan, impressed by the pious life of the nonagenarian abbot, released him and a few other Christian prisoners, and allowed him to bury the killed.
On the way back from Kazan to the Yellow Water Lake, Macarius is said to have stopped at a site near today's Sviyazhsk, blessing the future location of Makaryev Sviyazhsk Monastery. However, Macarius and his companions were not allowed to stay at the Yellow Water Lake site. He decided to leave a safe distance between themselves and the Khanate, and went to the forests of the Unzha River, a few hundred kilometers north of the Nizhny. It is a long way, and the travellers soon run out of food, but were miraculously saved from starvation (Venerable Macarius' Miracle of the Moose). Once they reached the Unzha, still in 1439, Macarius and his party founded Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery (now a convent).
According to legend, Macarius lived in his new monastery for a few more years, healing the sick and expelling devils from possessed people. He died on July 25 1444, at the age of 95, after an 83-year monastic career. After the two famous cloisters he founded, he is called Venerable Macarius of Yellow Water Lake and Unzha, the Miracle Worker.
Canonization
After the death of Macarius, a wooden church was built over his grave, and the Unzha monastery was named after him. The locals often reported being miraculously healed of various diseases after visiting his grave; his help was said to have repelled a Tatar invasion, and later, during the Time of Troubles, to protect the region against the Polish troops. The fame of the founder attracted pilgrims and novices to the monasteries, helping its growth.
When Feodor Romanov, the father of Russia's new Csar Michael, is enthroned as Patriarch Philaret of Moscow in 1619, he sends a commission to the Unzha to investigate the miracles. He mentions these miracles as confirmed in his letter to his son the Csar in September 1619, and encourages Michael to visit Macarius' Unzha Monastery in fulfillment of the vow he had given earlier (which Michael promptly does). It is thought that it was at that time that Venerable Macarius was canonized by a Sobor of the Russian Orthodox Church, which made his veneration nationwide.
Holy relics
The relics of Macarius were discovered in 1671, during a burial in the church where his body had been buried. After several years of disagreements as to whether the relics were genuine, and some minor miracles that convinced disbelievers that they were, they were put to rest in a reliquary in Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery. In 1929, Soviet authorities closed the monastery, and most of the relics ended up in the local history museum at Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast, where they were kept in storage until 1990, when they returned to Kostroma Eparchy (diocese). In 1995, these relics (bones and vestments) were brought back to Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery.
The head of Macarius, however, was missing. It was not until 2005 that the Eparchy (Archdiocese) of Nizhny Novgorod was contacted by a priest who had inherited the head (or most of it, at any rate) from his brother, also a priest, who in his turn had saved it from the Bolsheviks some time after the closing of the Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery in 1929. The priests had reverently kept the relics in their homes for many years, until they felt secure that the Russian Church is reborn and is restoring Macarius' monasteries. After the special commission of the archdiocese, with the forensic experts' help, established the genuineness of the relics, their return was celebrated at a special service in the Holy Saviour Cathedral in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin on March 23, 2006.
Since then, the head was kept in a special portable reliquary in Pechersky Ascension Monastery in Nizhny Novgorod, which the clerics can reverently take with them on a visit to a nursing home or to celebrate Feast of Venerable Macarius at his other, Zheltovodsky Monastery.
On the occasion of Macarius' feast in 2007, the head was permanently transferred from Nizhny Novgorod to Makaryev Zheltovodsky Monastery (Convent). The transfer took place during August 3–7, 2007. The prized relic, accompanied by Archbishop Georgy of Nizhny Novgorod and Arzamas and other ecclesiastical officials of Nizhny Novgorod Eparchy, was transported down the Volga by the boat "Alexander Peresvet" during August 3–7, 2007, with stopovers in Bor,
Kstovo and Lyskovo. Religious processions were organized in the cities visited, to carry Macarius' head from the Volga docksides to local churches for appropriate celebrations.
Macarius is considered the patron saint of craftsmen, merchants, and travellers, as well as of Makariev Fair. He is especially venerated in the Archdioceses (Eparchies) of Nizhny Novgorod, Ivanovo, and Kostroma—the lands where he performed his earthly works.
In some monasteries, such as Pechersky Ascension Monastery in Nizhny Novgorod, one can request a prayer to Macarius for success in business or "getting out of poverty" (избавление от нищеты).
Feasts
Russian Orthodox Church celebrates two Feasts of St. Macarius:
July 25 (Julian calendar) (currently, August 7 of the Western calendar): Death of St. Macarius (1444).
October 12 (Julian calendar) (currently, October 25 the Western calendar): Recovery of Holy Relics of St. Macarius (1671).

False Radiosity is a 3D computer graphics technique used to create texture mapping for objects that emulates patch interaction algorithms in radiosity rendering. Though practiced in some form since the late 90s, this term was coined only around 2002 by architect Andrew Hartness, then head of 3D and real-time design at Ateliers Jean Nouvel.
During the period of nascent commercial enthusiasm for radiosity-enhanced imagery, but prior to the democratization of powerful computational hardware, architects and graphic artists experimented with time-saving 3D rendering techniques. By darkening areas of texture maps corresponding to corners, joints and recesses, and applying maps via self-illumination or diffuse mapping in a 3D program, a radiosity-like effect of patch interaction could be created with a standard scan-line renderer. Successful emulation of radiosity required a theoretical understanding and graphic application of patch view factors, path tracing and global illumination algorithms. Texture maps were usually produced with image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop. The advantage of this method is decreased rendering time and easily modifiable overall lighting strategies.
Another common approach similar to false radiosity is the manual placement of standard omni-type lights with limited attenuation in places in the 3D scene where the artist would expect radiosity reflections to occur. This method uses many lights and can require an advanced light-grouping system, depending on what assigned materials/objects are illuminated, how many surfaces require false radiosity treatment, and to what extent it is anticipated that lighting strategies be set up for frequent changes.

is a 1955 Japanese drama film directed by Mikio Naruse. It is based on the novel of the same name by Japanese writer Fumiko Hayashi, published just before her death in 1951. The film received numerous national awards upon its release and remains one of director Naruse's most acclaimed works.
Plot
The film follows Yukiko, a woman who has just been expatriated from French Indochina, where she has been working as a secretary for a forestry project of the Japanese wartime government. Yukiko seeks out Kengo, one of the engineers of the project, with whom she had an affair and who had promised to divorce his wife for her. They renew their affair, but Kengo tells Yukiko he is unable to leave his wife. Yukiko can't cut ties with Kengo, although he even starts an affair with a married younger woman, while she becomes the mistress of an American soldier as a means to survive in times of economic restraint. Eventually, she follows Kengo to an island where he has taken a new job, where she dies of her bad health and the humid climate.

Yasujirō Ozu saw Floating Clouds in 1955, and called it "a real masterpiece" in his journals. The film is Naruse's most popular film in Japan. It was voted the second best Japanese film of all time in a poll of 140 Japanese critics and filmmakers conducted by the magazine Kinema Junpo in 1999. It also received 10 votes total in the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound critics' and directors' polls.
Analysis
Adrian Martin, editor of on-line film journal Rouge, has remarked upon Naruse's cinema of walking. Bertrand Tavernier, speaking of Naruse's Sound of the Mountain, described how the director minutely describes each journey and that "such comings and goings represent uncertain yet reassuring transitions: they are a way of taking stock, of defining a feeling". So in Floating Clouds, the walks down streets "are journeys of the everyday, where time is measured out of footfalls, – and where even the most melodramatic blow or the most ecstatic moment of pleasure cannot truly take the characters out of the unromantic, unsentimental forward progression of their existences."
The Australian scholar Freda Freiberg has remarked on the terrain of the film: "The frustrations and moroseness of the lovers in Floating Clouds are directly linked to and embedded in the depressed and demoralised social and economic conditions of early post-war Japan; the bombed-out cities, the shortage of food and housing, the ignominy of national defeat and foreign occupation, the economic temptation of prostitution with American military personnel."

Danila Valeryevich Kozlovsky (; born 3 May 1985) is a Russian actor and director.
Biography
Early life and career
Danila Kozlovsky was born in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. His mother, Nadezhda Zvenigorodskaya, is a stage actress, and his father, Valery Kozlovsky, was a professor at Moscow State University specializing in marketing and mass communications. He is the middle boy in a three boys family, has an older brother, Yegor, and a younger brother, Ivan. As a child Danila was slightly overweight. From a young age, Danila was placed in dance and music classes, learning to play the saxophone and the alto. During his early years, he frequently changed schools, potentially due to discipline issues. He made his big screen debut in 1998, playing the troubled sixth grader Denis on the Russian television series Simple Truths.
In 1996, he was accepted into the Kronshtadt Naval Military School, which he attended until his graduation in 2002. Upon graduation, he matriculated to the Saint Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy, entering the acting/directing course supervised by Lev Dodin. During his fourth year he made his debut on the stage of the Little Drama Theatre (Theatre de l'Europe), playing the part of Edgar in King Lear (2006). The role brought him his first theatre award: a special prize of Expert Council of the "Golden Sofit" (the top-rated theatre award in Saint Petersburg) for Best Debut. Then there was a role in the play Life and Fate, which premiered in Paris and the diploma performance "Warsaw Melody".
After graduating from the academy in 2007, Danila Kozlovskiy was officially admitted to the staff of the Little Drama Theatre (Theatre de l'Europe). In his repertoire were added performances Lord of the Flies, where he played Ralph, Intrigue and Love and The Cherry Orchard.
In 2005, he also received his first important film role – in the picture Garpastum. The film, set during the time of the First World War, tells the story of two brothers who wish to build their own football stadium. Kozlovsky received the Russian Guild of Film Critics "White Elephant Award" for the best male lead actor.
Kozlovsky gained wider publicity in 2008 with his starring role in the film Black Hunters. There he played the role of robber archaeologist Sergei Filatov, who is transported into the past together with his friends when making illegal excavations.
In 2009, he portrayed drag queen Lusya in the comedy-drama Jolly Fellows. It was screened in the Panorama section of the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival.
In 2011, he appeared as Marcus Blackwell in Need for Speed: The Run.

Nose prosthesis is a craniofacial prosthesis for someone who no longer has their original nose. Nose prostheses are designed by anaplastologists who have their patients referred to them by ear, nose, and throat doctors and plastic surgeons. Unlike the more common nasal operation called a rhinoplasty, total reconstruction of the nose using existing tissue, prosthetic nose implantation requires the nose to be made completely from synthetic material; prior to getting a nose prosthesis, the original nose is usually left partially intact, so a rhinectomy, surgical removal of the nose, has to be performed before a prosthetic nose can be used. One of the biggest challenges for anaplastologists in constructing a nose prosthesis is finding the right material to use for the nose, as it's a complex organ with several distinct functions and a unique structure. The major functions of the nose include the sense of smell (olfaction), filtered breathing, and alteration of speech. All of these tasks can be completed due to the nose's network of bones, cartilage, and muscle, which also helps to keep the nose stable on the face. Although there are currently usable prosthetic noses, they only have temporary functionality. Advancements in areas such as 3D-printing have medical professionals hoping to create noses that are as efficient as the real ones.
Reasons for Nose Removal
A nose prosthesis is only required if the nose cannot be repaired, and there are a variety of reasons this may occur.
A benign tumor or a malignant neoplasm forms within the nasal cavity. Threatening or not, it's too dangerous to leave cancerous tissue in the body, and the safest thing to do is to completely remove it.
An infection eats away part or even all of the nose causing instability and loss of function. Fungal sinusitis is one example of a disease that can destroy the nose.
A person is displeased with the way his/her nose looks. Instead of the traditional plastic surgery to realign it, he/she decides to get an entirely new nose.
A severe event, such as burns or significant blunt force, results in trauma to the nose disfiguring it to the point where getting a prosthetic one is necessary.
A congenital anomaly causes DNA for the formation of the nose to be damaged. Also, something can go wrong during development with the nose inside the womb, even if the DNA is correct.
Fabrication
Developing a nose prosthesis requires a balance of artistic and technological skills.
Materials
This required craftsmanship can be seen in the material used for nose prostheses, as it must support the functionality of the nose while staying cosmetically appealing to the patient. There are several different materials presently used for prosthetic noses:
Acrylic resins derived from ethylene are one of the most popular choices for constructing a nose prosthesis. While acrylic resins don't age quickly due to not degrading in UV light and good stability, they have high water sorption and are similar to plastic causing them to be rigidity.
Polyvinyl chloride co-polymers are made up of a mixture of plasticizer (substance which increases stiffness) and polyvinyl chloride. The benefits of polyvinyl chloride co-polymers include accessibility to extrinsic/intrinsic coloration and high flexibility, but they aren't very durable and break down in UV light.
Polyurethane elastomers are constructed via polymers with isocyanates and polymers with hydroxyl groups; these compounds have different properties based on the number of isocyanates present. Polyurethane elastomers give the best appearance of any substance due to its ability to be very elastic while not compromising strength. However, they aren't easily compatible with current attachment mechanisms.
Silicone elastomers are composed of RTV (room temperature vulcanization) silicone. Silicone is unique because it stays operational at many temperatures and can be used in many different ways due to its diverse forms, resulting in silicone being the most promising material for the future as researchers continue to develop new variations of it.
Design
Since patients must wait several months before they are given a permanent nose prosthesis, a temporary one is usually afforded to them after 3 to 4 weeks so that they can return to normal social activity. The critical parts in making sure the fabrication of a nose prosthesis are impression, sculpting, and painting. The process of creating a prosthetic nose differs based on each individual case, but most of them follow a general pattern of steps:
With the patient seated in a slightly upward position, the patient's face is draped with a cloth and stuffed with moist gauze to ensure that no excess material gets into the wrong areas.
Polyvinyl siloxane, a liquid that can quickly solidify, is used to make an impression of the desired area and gets examined so that the impression matches the defective spot.
Impression is transformed into a cast using type III dental stone (a substance similar to plastic).
Newly formed cast is then used to make a wax model. The anaplastologist will begin to work on cosmetic factors of the prosthetic nose based on the patient's appearance.
As wax model is continuously perfected, the patient is inspected in more detail to match the texture of his/her skin and other facial qualities.
Small amount of acrylic-based paint is added to start the intrinsic coloration (color in the core).
Wax model is dewaxed in a flask, and desired material for the nose prosthesis is processed.
Final layer of paint is added on the outside for extrinsic coloration (outer color) to match the skin-tone, and mono-poly, which aids with water resistance, is applied on top.
Originally, wax models were hand-crafted with hours of labor required to get it all correct, but the use of CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/manufacturing) has made the process cheaper, faster, and better in overall quality of the final product.
Method of Attachment
The major problem scientists face with generating attachment methods is finding an efficient way to combine live tissue with synthetic material:
Titanium implants, drilled into facial bones, enable the prosthetic nose to be magnetized allowing for easy attachment and removal.
Osseointegration is similar to the process of using magnets, except the nose prosthesis is attached directly to the face instead of through magnetic forces.
Eyeglass frames can be worn with the artificial nose attached underneath. However, if the patient's face is too flat, the glasses have potential to slide down from gravity.
Adhesive substances, such as glues, bind the prosthetic nose to the face, but they aren't used as much anymore since they irritate the skin and damage the prosthesis when it is removed.
Just as none of the materials are ideal in making the best prosthetic nose, all of the attachment methods have their own flaws.
Future Technologies
Electronic Nose
Although artificial noses with the ability to "smell" are currently available, they're only for industrial use, mainly in the food, beverage, and cosmetic industry. To make this technology compatible with humans, not only would the technology have to be incorporated into the complex prosthetic nose, but it also has to be adapted to send signals to the brain. The mechanism used for processing smell, known as the electronic nose, is copied from the brain's approach for smell. The electronic nose is broken down into 3 main units: the array of chemically broad-band sensors, the conversion of one type of signal into another, and the classification of the odor. Each sensor on the array is set to flare only when a specific molecule is present, so a certain smell will cause multiple different sensors to fire together, making the smell distinguishable. The odorant causes the sensors to create a chemical signal which is initially converted into an electrical signal before it is finally transformed into a digital signal. This digital data is then interpreted by a microprocessor, which acts as the brain, to give an output for the encountered smell. The real challenge remains to be solved as the brain is much more intricate than a computer, and medical professionals need to find a way to get the brain to respond to a synthetic part.
3D-Printing
Although prostheses right now use synthetic material, bioengineered tissue created from 3D-printing is improving daily. Manufactured cells can be used to create real versions of organs, which may allow for a full recovery of function. Every organ has a distinct set of cells, so extensive research still needs to be completed to accommodate for the requirements of each body part. The nose is one of the more challenging organs to produce due to its complexity in function and design. If bioengineering techniques can be perfected, the outcome would have huge benefits as donors would no longer be needed and patients could return to how their lives were before losing their original nose. Bioengineered tissue is currently available for limited use, but it hasn't yet been authorized for use in human transplants.

Sutherland Industrial is an industrial subdivision located in east-central Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was originally part of Sutherland, a town outside of Saskatoon before being annexed by the city in 1956. The subdivision also contains the first urban reserve in Saskatchewan, the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation.
History
The land where Sutherland and Sutherland Industrial now sit was purchased in 1905 by Albert H. Hanson, a noted Saskatoon real estate agent. He sold part of his land to the Canadian Pacific Railway. The area was built up when the CPR branch line between Regina and Edmonton reached Saskatoon in 1907. The CPR yards and station were constructed three miles (5 km) east of Saskatoon. A settlement grew adjacent to the rail yards, and was incorporated as the village of Sutherland August 30, 1909. It was named after William Charles Sutherland, a politician who served on Saskatoon's town council before it became a city in 1906.
The triangular shape of the industrial subdivision came about as the two parts of Sutherland were developed. West of 1st (later Central) Avenue, Albert Hanson subdivided the rest of his land holdings on a north-south axis, and developed it as residential and commercial properties. On the other side of the tracks, the CPR subdivided its land following the rail axis on an angle from southeast to northwest. The resulting gap between Central Avenue and the tracks was built up as light industrial lands.
In 1956, the town was annexed by the growing city of Saskatoon. Sutherland became the city's easternmost neighbourhood until development in the 1970s took place even further east. The amalgamation required some name changes to Sutherland's streets, to avoid confusion with identically-named streets already in Saskatoon (e.g. 10th Street became 110th Street). At some point after annexation, the neighbourhood boundaries were redrawn. The mainly residential portion of the former town became the neighbourhood of Sutherland, while the rail yards and associated industrial lands were split off as the Sutherland Industrial subdivision. Development of the portion of Sutherland Industrial east of Central Avenue and north of what is now College Drive began in earnest in the early 1960s.
A small chunk of Sutherland Industrial was transferred to neighbouring Sutherland with the construction of several apartment buildings on Central Place. The Sutherland Branch of the Saskatoon Public Library was located within Sutherland Industrial for many years until a new facility was developed in the University Heights Suburban Centre in the 1990s.
In 1988, the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation settled a land claim which created western Canada's first urban reserve. Title to of land in the southeast part of Sutherland Industrial was transferred to the band. Under an agreement with the City of Saskatoon, the band does not pay civic taxes, but collects its own levy and pays the city for services. The development of the reserve is also in accordance with laws of Saskatchewan and the bylaws of Saskatoon.
Road improvements over the years included the addition of southern access via McKercher Drive, which was extended into Sutherland Industrial following the construction of an interchange with College Drive in the early 1980s. Future development plans published by the City of Saskatoon since the 1980s indicate that McKercher Drive is to eventually be extended north into Erindale, providing an additional access point into the industrial area.
Government and politics
Sutherland exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon—University. It is currently represented by Corey Tochor of the Conservative Party of Canada, who was first elected in 2019.
Provincially, the area is within the constituency of Saskatoon Silverspring-Sutherland. It is currently represented by Paul Merriman of the Saskatchewan Party, first elected in 2011 and re-elected in 2016.
In Saskatoon's non-partisan municipal politics, Sutherland lies within ward 1. It is currently represented by Darren Hill, first elected in 2006.
The eastern portion of Sutherland Industrial - specifically that portion east of Packham Avenue and straddling the northern extension of McKercher Drive - is considered part of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation.
Industrial
The entirety of Sutherland Industrial is zoned for industrial uses. Heavy industrial businesses are located along the CPR tracks to the north, while light industrial businesses are concentrated in the south along College Drive.
Currently there are CPR switching yards in the Central Industrial neighbourhood. The City of Saskatoon, Canadian Pacific Railway and the CNR are under negotiations currently to remove these switching yards. This would mean the CPR could use CNR rail lines through the city and be able to use the CN Chappell Yards for switching. Likewise the CNR could run trains along the CPR track through the city and use the Sutherland CPR switching yards. This would involve construction of a connecting switching yard between CP and CN rail lines near 11th Street and Dundonald which could be done as part of the new Circle Drive extension project.
Location
Sutherland Industrial is located within the University Heights Suburban Development Area. It is bounded by Gray Avenue to the north and east, College Drive to the south, and Central Avenue to the west. Some limited residential development on the east side of Central Avenue, including multi-family dwellings on Central Place, are part of the main Sutherland community, rather than Sutherland Industrial.

Raden Moehamad Djoehana Wiradikarta (born 18 September 1896 in Bandung, Indonesia – died in 1986 in Bandung) was a professor in microbiology and serology at the Bandung Institute of Technology and the faculty of medicine at Padjadjaran University, also in Bandung. He played a significant role in the development of the Indonesian higher education system.
He was also one of the founders of Padjadjaran University, in particular its faculty of medicine. He was the first native Indonesian to be appointed to the position of dean of the faculty of sciences at the University of Indonesia in Bandung in 1957. He is also one of the founders of private university Universitas Nasional.
Djoehana was one of five members of the committee for the establishment of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Biography
Djoehana was born in what was the Dutch East Indies. His father, Raden Rangga Wiradikarta, was wedana ("subdistrict head") of Majalaya south of Bandung, and belonged to the Sundanese nobility, as did his mother. Djoehana attended STOVIA (School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen, "school for the training of native physicians") and graduated in 1918. He was then appointed as a district physician in Bawean Island. After that he held various positions in the colonial government health system, in various cities in Sumatra and Java.
In 1930, he was sent to Amsterdam University in the Netherlands, where he got his "European" Doctor of Medicine degree the following year. Back in the Netherlands Indies, he was the director of the public hospital of Ambarawa in Central Java when Japanese troops landed in 1942. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Djoehana was deputy director of the laboratory of the Eijkman Institute in Jakarta.
On 17 September 1945, exactly one month after the proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Djoehana was appointed to a committee with five members formed by President Sukarno to establish the Indonesian Red Cross.
In 1947, Djoehana was appointed gewoon hoogleraar ("university professor") at what was to become the faculty of medicine of the University of Indonesia in 1950. From 1951 to 1954, he was head of the Landskoepokinrichting, which was renamed (1950-60) Pasteur Institute of Indonesia, and then (1960) became the state-owned pharmaceutical company PT Bio Farma. He was the first native Indonesian to head this organization, having been in existence since colonial times.
In 1953, he was appointed "professor extraordinary" in microbiology and serology at the Faculty of Sciences, the University of Indonesia in Bandung, established in 1950.
In 1956, Djoehana was appointed vice-president of the foundation in charge of setting up a faculty of medicine at Padjadjaran University, of which he became the first dean (1957-1962). In 1957, he became the first native Indonesian to hold the position of dean, Faculty of Sciences, University of Indonesia in Bandung, replacing Dutch Professor H. Th. M. Leeman. This faculty was the last in Indonesia to still be headed by somebody from the Nederlands, because of difficulties in finding a qualified person required during the initial years of independence.
As dean of the Faculty of Sciences, Djoehana participated in the establishment of the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) in 1959 and was appointed a member of the Presidium of the ITB on March 2, 1959 until November 1, 1959 when Prof. Ir. R. O. Kosasih was appointed as Rector of ITB.
Djoehana was married to the sister of Sjahrir, the first prime minister of the Republic of Indonesia from 1945 to 1947, and founder of the Indonesian Socialist Party

Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) were issued by the Government of India in exercise of powers conferred to it under section 145(2) of The Income Tax Act, 1961.
The Ministry of Finance published 14 draft ICDS, out of which 10 ICDS were notified by the government on 31 March 2015. The government specified a deferment of one year from the date of implementation of these standards; the notified ICDS will be applicable from the financial year 2016-17.
ICDS were issued with the aim of bringing uniformity in accounting policies governing computation of income in accordance with tax related provisions, and also reducing the irregularities amongst them. The ICDS were developed using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAPs) with assistance from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
The Form 3CD (Tax Audit Report) is already been revised for making mandatory disclosures in compliance with ICDS.
History
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) formed an Accounting Standards Committee which had earlier issued draft of 14 Tax Accounting Standards in 2012. On the basis of suggestions and comments received from stakeholders, CBDT revised and issued a 12 draft ICDS for public opinion. On 31 March 2015 the government issued 10 out of those 12 drafts.
Applicability
ICDS are to be followed by all assesses, except individual or Hindu Undivided Family who are not covered under tax audit provisions, following Mercantile System of accounting.
List of Income Computation and Disclosure Standards
Miscellaneous provisions
For the sake of be-verity and for the ease of tax payers, the notification provided several transitional provisions for the purpose of application of ICDS.
Noncompliance of ICDS could result in the best judgement assessment by tax authorities, which may lead to protracted litigations.

Erigeron filifolius is a North American species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae known by the common names thread-leaf fleabane.
Erigeron filifolius is widespread across much of western North America. It has been found in western Canada (British Columbia) and the western United States, primarily east of the crest of the Cascade Range of Washington, Oregon, and northern California extending eastward to southern Idaho and northeast Nevada. Within its distribution, it occupies a large range of elevations from near sea level to .
Erigeron filifolius is a branched perennial herb up to in height. Leaves are long and thin, often thread-like, up to long. Each stem sometimes produces only 1 flower head per stem, sometimes flat-topped clusters of 10 or more. Each head may contain as many as 125 white, blue, pink, or lavender ray florets surrounding numerous yellow disc florets.

Pikmin 3 is a real-time strategy and puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii U video game console. It is the sequel to the GameCube games Pikmin (2001) and Pikmin 2 (2004), and was released in Japan on July 13, 2013, and in all other regions within the following month. Shigeru Miyamoto announced Pikmin 3 on July 16, 2008, for the Wii console, later stating at E3 2011 that it had transitioned to Wii U.
The game builds upon existing elements of the Pikmin series, adding more player characters, Pikmin types, and support for Off-TV Play and downloadable content. In the single-player campaign, the player controls three alien captains, who explore the surface of a planet they name PNF-404 in search of cultivable fruit seeds to save their home planet, Koppai, from famine. They befriend the Pikmin who assist them in combat, solving puzzles, and amassing resources.
Pikmin 3 received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the gameplay, graphics and level design. Pikmin 3 Deluxe, an enhanced port for the Nintendo Switch, was released on October 30, 2020. A sequel, Pikmin 4, is slated for 2023.
Gameplay
The player controls a captain which commands a horde of up to 100 plant-like creatures called Pikmin, and uses their unique abilities to explore the world, combat enemies, solve puzzles, and amass treasures. Pikmin can be directed to accomplish various tasks, such as building bridges, destroying barriers, collecting spoils and defeating enemies. They come in various colors and different physical features that signify their special abilities or immunities to hazards. For example, Red Pikmin are immune to fire and can fight harder, Yellow Pikmin are immune to electricity and can be thrown farther, and Blue Pikmin are immune to water.
The red, yellow, and blue Pikmin continue through the series, and Pikmin 3 introduces two Pikmin types: grey-colored Rock Pikmin, which can destroy tough barriers, and are immune to being crushed by heavy objects; and pink-colored Winged Pikmin, which can attack airborne enemies, carry items through the air, and travel over water.
The player controls up to three new different captains over the Pikmin, one more than in Pikmin 2. The player can instantly switch between these groups in order to accomplish tasks more quickly or solve certain puzzles.
The initial release of Pikmin 3 offers three control schemes: the Wii U GamePad, Wii U Pro Controller, or Wii Remote (Plus) with the Nunchuk accessory. In all cases, the Wii U GamePad has an overhead map on its touch screen. A downloadable update on May 30, 2014, adds stylus control on the GamePad. The GamePad is used to access the similar-looking KopPad, which the captain uses to view the map and other statistics, and for communication with the other squad members. The KopPad allows players to map the captains' routes, and to take photographs with detailed camera controls, which could be uploaded to the now-defunct Miiverse.
Aside from a single-player story campaign, the game features a split-screen, competitive, two-player multiplayer mode called Bingo Battle. In this mode each player has a 4 by 4 grid of items to collect, and must compete to get four-in-a-row on their board. Mission Mode is a single-player or cooperative multiplayer experience where the players are presented with a task based on Pikmin fundamentals, which must be completed in a limited amount of time. There are three trials present within Mission Mode: Collect Treasure, where the players must collect all the fruit and enemies on the map using a set amount of Pikmin before time runs out; Battle Enemies, where the players must kill all the enemies on the map as quickly as possible; and Defeat Bosses, which allows the players to re-encounter the boss creatures from story mode.
Plot
Pikmin 3 is set on the mysterious planet from the previous Pikmin games, now designated "PNF-404". Five different areas on PNF-404 are accessible for the player to explore, each with diverse topography. The narrator explains that the inhabitants of the planet Koppai are suffering from famine as a result of a "booming population, booming appetites, and a basic lack of planning".
Having scouted multiple planets with their SPEROS ships, the planet returns positive with abundance of cultivable food. Three Koppaite explorer captains, Alph, Brittany, and Charlie, are sent to explore and retrieve food sources. Their ship, the S.S. Drake, malfunctions and crash-lands, separating the three. Captain Charlie falls to the Distant Tundra and meets the Yellow Pikmin, but is eaten by a monster. Alph wakes up in the Tropical Wilds and meets the Red Pikmin, who help him recover their ship. Alph learns that the "cosmic drive key" is required to warp back to Koppai. Alph finds Brittany in the Garden of Hope, and rescues her with the help of Rock Pikmin. The two captains rescue Captain Charlie, after the S.S. Drake crashes and Brittany discovers Yellow Pikmin. They retrieve some fruits for the food supply and harvest the seeds on their journey. The S.S. Drake and the Pikmin Onions ascend into low orbit each evening to avoid voracious nocturnal creatures. The trio recover one of Captain Olimar's lost data files, and suspect that he has the key and explore in his pursuit. Later, they mistakenly rescue Louie, who steals all of their food supply and escapes to the Garden of Hope. After retrieving them both, they restrain and interrogate Louie, who tells them that Olimar is at Formidable Oak. There, the captains and the Pikmin defeat a mysterious life form known as the Plasm Wraith, to save Olimar, who had taken the cosmic-drive key, thinking it is a treasure, and he gives it back. The explorers use the key for the ship, offering Olimar and Louie a ride back to Hocotate, and they return home as the Pikmin wave goodbye.
The narrator speaks at the game's ending, which varies based on the number of fruit the player retrieved during the game. If the player collects a minimum amount of fruit, the narrator states the explorers feel "unease" over the possibility the seeds collected will not be enough to save Koppai. If the player collects a respectable amount of fruit, it is stated that careful planning will be required to save Koppai. If the player collects all fruits, the narrator states that the three have successfully completed their mission to restore life in Koppai and that the cause of the S.S. Drakes crash-landing may be on purpose. In a post-credits scene, some Pikmin see a flaming object falling to the ground and run to it. An additional story in Pikmin 3 Deluxe, "Olimar's Comeback", reveals the object to be a pod containing Olimar and Louie, who are sent back to the planet by the president of Hocotate Freight to repair and retrieve the damaged spaceship they left behind.
Development
Shigeru Miyamoto first hinted about the possibility of a new Pikmin game in a July 2007 interview with IGN, saying "I certainly don't think we've seen the last of Pikmin. I definitely would like to do something with them, and I think the Wii interface in particular is very well suited to that franchise." A later CNET.com interview in April 2008 reported that "For now, Miyamoto looks ahead to other projects for the Wii, mentioning his desire to continue the Pikmin series."
A new Pikmin game was confirmed at E3 2008 during Nintendo's developer roundtable, in which Miyamoto stated that his team were working on a new entry in the series. Details concerning gameplay and development were left unmentioned. At Miyamoto's roundtable discussion at E3 2011, Miyamoto stated that Pikmin 3 development was moved to Wii U, the Wii's successor. He said that the Wii U's HD graphics and secondary-screen GamePad would work better for it.
On June 5, 2012, Pikmin 3 was shown at Nintendo's press conference at E3. Some of the new gameplay aspects were demonstrated, including rock Pikmin and the GamePad controls. The company said that it would be released around the same time as the Wii U, but its release was later delayed until mid-2013. When questioned about the presence or absence of the purple and white Pikmin types featured in the second game, Miyamoto stated that "They're in there somewhere, just hidden...". A video released from Nintendo Direct confirmed that they would in fact be in the game, but only in the game's Mission Mode and Bingo Battle.
In a Polygon interview, Miyamoto stated that he plans to have a series of animated Pikmin shorts released on the Nintendo 3DS prior to Pikmin 3s launch. The shorts went unheard of for months after the game's initial release, were eventually mentioned by Miyamoto a year later, and were announced to be released on November 5, 2014, on the Nintendo eShop.
Release

Progesterone carboxymethyloxime, or progesterone 3-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime (P4-3-CMO), is a progestin which was never marketed. It is an oral prodrug of progesterone with improved pharmacokinetic properties. The compound was developed in an attempt to address the poor oral pharmacokinetics of progesterone, including its very low bioavailability and short biological half-life. These properties of progesterone are thought to be caused by its low water solubility and high metabolic clearance rate due to rapid degradation in the intestines and liver. Drugs with low aqueous solubility are not absorbed well in the intestines because their dissolution in water is limited.
P4-3-CMO (as the potassium salt) showed water solubility that was increased by more than four orders of magnitude relative to progesterone (solubility = 9.44 mol/L and 0.0006 mol/L, respectively). In addition, it showed an in vitro terminal half-life in rat liver microsomes that was 363-fold longer than that of progesterone (half-life = 795.5 minutes and 2.2 minutes, respectively). As such, P4-3-CMO could have both improved absorption and increased metabolic stability relative to progesterone. However, the compound has not been further assessed nor studied in humans.

Critical reception
The (reviewer) of the Chichester Festival Theatre production wrote in indielondon.co.uk: "Stephen Clark has adapted the story into a succession of short scenes which, under Rachel Kavanaugh's adept direction, follow on cohesively and coherently resulting in a believable and very poignant evening. Howard Goodall's songs are integral to the action and they are beautifully performed by the principals and [the] chorus. [T]he two principals, Oliver (Michael Xavier) and Jenny (Emma Williams)...give superb and utterly sincere performances."
In its review roundup of the musical at the Chichester Festival Theatre, theatremania.com noted the reviews "praising Goodall's score, Kavanaugh's staging and the central performances from Xavier and Williams."
Chichester Festival Theatre production review: "Howard Goodall and Stephen Clark have created a terrific new musical...The show finished to a chorus of heavy sniffles, superseded by hearty applause, which I take to mean a West End transfer should be given".
The (reviewer) of the West End production at the Duchess Theatre for Whatsonstage.com wrote: "Goodall's music...is always interesting, often beautiful.... The framing epitaph is lovely writing, too.... Rachel Kavanaugh's austere production on an all-white design by Peter McKintosh – whose three Corinthian pillars somehow conjure Pearl and Dean as readily as pearly gates – transfers well from the Minerva in Chichester.... This is a high-calibre chamber musical, all right, with a top skill factor in both writing and onstage musicianship (piano, guitar and string quintet); then just when it's nearly enough, it plummets into bathos and easily resistible, tear-jerking manipulation."
The Dutch version was well received by Dutch critics after its opening night. Amsterdam daily Het Parool wrote: "A wonderful, subdued 'Love Story'. No superficial pathos, wonderful melodies by Howard Goodall... A little, surprisingly enchanting version of this well known story".

Gary L. Browning (born 1940) is an American Russian language academic and was the first mission president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Russia, and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
Early life and education
Born in St. Maries, Idaho, Browning was a missionary for the LDS Church in Finland as a young man. Upon returning from his mission, he earned a bachelor's degree in Russian from Brigham Young University, a master's degree from Syracuse University, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University. In 1969, Browning lived in Moscow for six months while he worked as a guide for a United States Information Agency exhibit. In 1973, Browning returned to live in Russia for six months as he researched his Ph.D. dissertation.
Academic career
Browning spent two years as a member of the faculty of Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, and then joined the faculty of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah as a professor of Russian language and literature. In the 1980s, he founded a Utah County chapter of Utahns Against the Nuclear Arms Race and became a peace activist.
Involvement with LDS Church
In July 1990, Browning was asked by the LDS Church to become the president of the newly created Finland Helsinki East Mission of the church. This mission was headquartered in Helsinki, but all its assigned missionaries preached in Russia and the Baltic states. At the time, there were small branches of the LDS Church in Leningrad, Tallinn, Vyborg, and Moscow. The Leningrad Branch was the first LDS Church congregation to receive official recognition within Russia. Browning is recognized by the LDS Church as the first mission president in Russia and the Baltic states.
In February 1992, the Finland Helsinki East Mission was dissolved and divided into the Russia Moscow Mission and the Russia St. Petersburg Mission; Browning became the first president of the Moscow Mission and served in this capacity until July 1993. After his mission service, Browning returned as a faculty member of Brigham Young University. He served two terms as the chair of the Department of Germanic and Slavic Languages. He retired and is a professor emeritus of BYU.

Skoulding's Mill is a Grade II listed tower mill at Kelsale, Suffolk, England which has been converted to residential accommodation.
History
Skoulding's Mill was built in 1856 by John Whitmore, the Wickham Market millwright. It was intended to replace a post mill in the same yard. It worked in conjunction with the post mill and a steam mill erected close by. The mill worked by wind until c1905 when it was refitted with roller milling equipment driven by a steam engine. The cap was removed in the early 1950s and the mill stripped of machinery at a later date. The empty mill tower was converted to residential accommodation.
Description
Skoulding's Mill is a tall seven storey tower mills. The tower is to the curb. It is diameter at the base and diameter at curb leve. The walls are thick at ground level. The mill had an ogee cap with a gallery, winded by a fantail. The four double Patent sails drove three pairs of millstones. The lower two storeys of the mill were tarred, with the upper five painted white. The converted mill has a flat roof with a guard rail and a flagpole.

The eastern crested berrypecker (Paramythia montium) is a species of bird in the family Paramythiidae. It is commonly found in the high montane forests and shrublands of New Guinea.
There are two subspecies, Paramythia montium montium and Paramythia montium brevicauda. The former inhabits the eastern portion of the New Guinea Highlands while the latter can be found in the Huon Peninsula. The western crested berrypecker (P. olivacea) was formerly considered conspecific but was split from it in 2021.
Description
The species is 20–23 cm (7.9–9 in) and can be quickly identified by its characteristic black mask, pointed crest, and white eyebrow. Its plumage is largely blue and green with yellow undertail-coverts. The tail of the brevicauda subspecies is noticeably shorter than that of the montium subspecies.

Following is a table of the United States presidential elections in Connecticut, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1788, Connecticut has participated in every U.S. presidential election.
Winners of the state are in bold. The shading refers to the state winner, and not the national winner.
Elections from 1864 to present
Election of 1860
The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country. The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War.
Elections from 1828 to 1856
Election of 1824
The election of 1824 was a complex realigning election following the collapse of the prevailing Democratic-Republican Party, resulting in four different candidates each claiming to carry the banner of the party, and competing for influence in different parts of the country. The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.
Elections from 1788-89 to 1820
In the election of 1820, incumbent President James Monroe ran effectively unopposed, winning all 9 of Connecticut's electoral votes, and all electoral votes nationwide except 1 vote in New Hampshire. To the extent that a popular vote was held, it was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President.
In elections prior to 1820, Connecticut did not conduct a popular vote. Each Elector was appointed by the state legislature.

Cultural variation refers to the rich diversity in social practices that different cultures exhibit around the world. Cuisine and art all change from one culture to the next, but so do gender roles, economic systems, and social hierarchy among any number of other humanly organised behaviours. Cultural variation can be studied across cultures (for example, a cross-cultural study of ritual in Indonesia and Brazil) or across generations (for example, a comparison of Generation X and Generation Y) and is often a subject studied by anthropologists, sociologists and cultural theorists with subspecialties in the fields of economic anthropology, ethnomusicology, health sociology etc. In recent years, cultural variation has become a rich source of study in neuroanthropology, cultural neuroscience, and social neuroscience.

Robert Lee Baird (November 17, 1920 - December 16, 2005) was an American jockey and trainer in Thoroughbred horse racing and a decorated soldier who served with General Patton's Third Army in World War II with which he landed on Utah Beach on D Day.
Robert Lee Baird was often referred to as "Bobby" and usually recorded in racing sheets as R. L. Baird. His career began in 1937 but would be interrupted for three and a half years of wartime military service during which he was awarded four Purple Hearts. It ended with his retirement in 1982 with 3,749 career wins. For the final three years in racing, Baird worked as a trainer and then as an agent for his son, jockey Edward Thomas Baird who was often recorded as E. T. Baird.
Baird rode in the Kentucky Derby five times, the last coming in 1978 which made the then fifty-seven-year-old the oldest jockey ever to compete in the first leg of the U. S. Triple Crown series. Also in that race was sixteen-year-old Steve Cauthen, the youngest jockey to ever ride in the Kentucky Derby who became its youngest winner aboard Affirmed.
In 1975 Baird was inducted into the Fair Grounds Racing Hall of Fame.

Marguerite Audoux (July 7, 1863 at Sancoins, Cher – January 31, 1937 at Saint-Raphaël, Var) was a French novelist.
Biography
Marguerite Donquichote, who took her mother's name, Audoux, in 1895, was orphaned by age three, following the death of her mother and abandonment by her father. She and her sister Madeleine initially lived with an aunt but ultimately spent nine years in the orphanage at Bourges. In 1877, Andoux was put to work as a shepherdess and farmworker in the region of Sologne. There, she fell in love with a local boy, Henri Dejoulx, but his parents would not permit them to marry.
Audoux moved to Paris in 1881. Desperately poor, she found occasional work as a seamstress and made ends meet with whatever menial labour could be found. She bore a stillborn child in 1883; the difficult pregnancy and labor left her permanently sterile.
In Paris, she took custody of her niece, Yvonne. It was Yvonne who at age sixteen inadvertently set in motion her aunt's literary career: Yvonne, while prostituting herself (without Audoux's knowledge) in the Parisian neighborhood of the Halles, met a young man named Jules Iehl. Iehl, who also wrote under the pen name Michel Yell, was moved by the young woman's impossible situation and accompanied her home, where he met Audoux. Iehl and Audoux would remain romantically involved until 1912.
Yell introduced Audoux to the Parisian intelligentsia—a group that included Charles-Louis Philippe, Léon-Paul Fargue, Léon Werth and Francis Jourdain. He also encouraged her to write her memoirs. The memoirs fell into the hands of celebrated author Octave Mirbeau and proved so compelling that Mirbeau immediately arranged to have them published.
Though success and critical acclaim followed quickly on the heels of the December 1910 publication of Audoux's memoirs, her next book was ten years in the making. The Studio of Marie-Claire, published in 1920, was merely a modest success; none of her subsequent novels--From the Mill to the Town (1926), The Fiancee (1932), and finally Soft Light, (1937)--matched the success of her bestseller debut.
After her death in January 1937, the novelist was buried in Saint-Raphaël, not far from the ocean she loved.
Works
Marie-Claire, with a foreword by Octave Mirbeau (1910). English translation by John N. Raphael, with an introduction by Arnold Bennett, London, Chapman & Hall, 1911, and New York, Hodder & Stoughton, 1911.
Audoux's first novel is the most autobiographical of the four. She describes her childhood and adolescence. The first part of the novel tells the story of her mother's death, of her father's departure, and of the nine years she spent in the orphanage of the convent Hôpital Général de Bourges. It was a dark period, made brighter however by the guiding presence of Sister Marie-Aimée. The second part of the novel takes place on the farm in Villevielle where Marie-Claire's first employers Master Sylvain and Pauline surround the young shepherdess with good-hearted affection. In the third part, Marie-Claire, now a young woman, falls in love with Henri Deslois, the brother of the farmer's wife who followed Pauline. The young man's mother forbids Marie-Claire to see her son again. Marie-Claire returns to the convent where she sees Sister Marie-Aimée before leaving again for Paris.
L'Atelier de Marie-Claire (1920), Grasset, Les Cahiers Rouges, 1987. (Marie-Claire's Workshop)
The sewing shop where Marie-Claire found work is described as a big family. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Dalignac and the workers, forced to work in factories when the sewing shop did not have enough work for them, share the same dependence on the sewing shop's demanding and stingy clients. And so the novel is both a social portrait that precisely depicts the characters of the workers and a series of anecdotes that keep the plot of the novel moving forward. After the death of the shop's owners, the reader doesn't know if Marie-Claire will marry Clément (Mrs. Dalignac's nephew), a man she does not love.
De la ville au moulin, Fasquelle, 1926. (From the City to the Mill)
While trying to break up a fight between her parents, Annette Beauois is wounded in the hip and is left with a limp. She leaves for her uncle's mill, soon followed by her brothers and sisters that her parents entrust to her care due to their separation. At the age of twenty she agrees to live with a friend of her brother's named Valère, who is alcoholic and cheats on her. She leaves him while pregnant, going to Paris to give birth, but the child is stillborn. In Paris she gets back together with her family, then, after the war is over, she meets Valère again, who was severely wounded in the war. She is ready to give him a second chance.
Douce Lumière, Grasset, 1937 (posth.) (Gentle Light)
Douce (Gentle) is Eglantine Lumière's nickname. Douce's mother died while giving birth to her, causing her father to kill himself out of despair, and her maternal grandfather unjustly takes out his bitterness over the affair on the young girl. Douce finds comfort in the company of her young neighbor Noël, and over the course of time their relationship turns into love. But Douce is the victim of a vicious campaign by Noël's family to keep the lovers apart. The heroine, traumatized by her experience but remaining true to Noël's memory, goes back to Paris where she befriends her neighbor Jacques, unhappy in love then widowed. The pair tries for love but fails. Jacque leaves for the war. When he returns he has lost his mind.
