Meirav Osher, whose father Avi Osher was murdered by an Arab terrorist in 1991, on Sunday called on Cabinet ministers who supported the release of terrorists as a “gesture” to the Palestinian Authority (PA) not to come to ceremonies on Memorial Day.
Osher's murderer, Sharif Abu-Dahila, was released this past October as part of the third batch of terrorists Israel had agreed to release during peace talks with the PA.
"This Memorial Day is different from past ones,” Meirav Osher told Arutz Sheva. “The Government of Israel betrayed its people and released murderers for a piece of paper containing some falsehood. Bodies of terrorists were returned without the victims' families being informed about it in advance. They released the vile murderer of my father and it's a tough feeling. We do not forgive nor forget the ministers who voted in favor, the Prime Minister and anyone else who supported this release.”
Avi Osher, 40 at the time of his death, had managed the date grove at Moshav Masua. Abu-Dahila, who had worked for Osher for years, stabbed him to death and hid his body in a vineyard.
“My father was a lovely man, he was good to the Arab employees, viewed them as human beings just like him, and the terrorist took advantage of my father's kindness and his fair treatment of him,” said Meirav Osher. “He took a machete and took advantage of a day when other workers were off to murder him. Then he went back to the packing house, drank coffee, stole my father's M-16 and hid for a year before being caught.”
She expressed anger not only at those Cabinet ministers who voted in favor of the terrorist releases, but also at those who voted against but failed to resign after the releases were approved.
“They should have said ‘enough is enough' because people are still being murdered, but they didn't,” said Osher.
"From a moral point of view, I would advise the ministers who voted in favor of [releasing terrorists] not to come to the cemeteries [for the memorial ceremonies],” she continued. “They have no right to be there. You freed the murderers and we do not want to hear or see you. Leave us alone because you betrayed us and we are now walking around with terrible feelings. Do not come to the cemeteries. You aren't wanted there.”
Former UFC light heavyweight champion and UFC Hall of Famer Chuck Liddell recently came out and said he believes he could give Jon Jones problems if they fought in their prime and said he's catch him with something eventually if they fought.
Well, Jones could't help but respond, via social media.
Jones sent out a tweet simply saying ‘Oh Chuck…' and then started responding to fans asking him about it.
He also posted a tweet saying that at this point Chuck Norris would be a bigger challenge, but that was deleted. However, you can see the screen shot below, a long with the rest of the tweets.

Positive election results; medical marijuana bill to be introduced next session!
Last update: December 18, 2018
Marijuana policy reform is sweeping the Midwest! Indiana's neighbor to the north, Michigan, just legalized marijuana for adult use. Indiana is also flanked by Illinois and Ohio, both states with comprehensive medical marijuana programs. It's only a matter of time before Indiana changes its marijuana laws.
While it was a positive step forward for the state, Indiana's current low-THC CBD law leaves many patients behind. Republican Rep. Jim Lucas has said he intends to introduce a medical marijuana bill next session, which begins in January. Please let your lawmakers know that you support a comprehensive and workable medical marijuana in Indiana.
Gov. Holcomb signs bill legalizing low-THC CBD oil
On March 21, 2018, Gov. Eric Holcomb signed Senate Enrolled Act 52, legalizing low-THC CBD derived from industrial hemp. The bill allows any person to buy, sell, and possess CBD oil, as long as it meets certain labeling requirements and contains no more than 0.3 percent THC.
The bill provides a much-needed expansion to Indiana's 2017 low-THC law for patients with seizure disorders, which only allowed CBD oil for epileptic patients while providing no way for them to purchase it. Still, the new law provides no clarification on the legality of manufacturing CBD in Indiana.
While this is a positive step forward for the state, it leaves behind most patients who could benefit from an effective medical marijuana program. Ask your lawmakers to support a program that allows as much THC as patients need. Please let your lawmakers know that you want comprehensive reform!
Learn about Indiana's marijuana laws
Indiana has some of the most draconian marijuana penalties in the country. Possession of even a single joint is punishable by up to a year of incarceration and a fine of up to $5,000. Sadly, almost 90% of all reported burglaries, including home invasions, and over 85% of all motor vehicle thefts go unsolved, according to the state-based reports from Indiana state law enforcement to the FBI for the year 2012. During the same year, law enforcement devoted valuable time and resources to either arresting or citing over 9,000 individuals for marijuana-related offenses, 86% of which were for possession.
African Americans often bear the brunt of unfair enforcement of marijuana prohibition policies, and in Indiana, African Americans are over three times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than their white counterparts, even though blacks and whites consume marijuana at similar rates. For more information on how the war on marijuana is often waged unequally, check out this report by the ACLU.
Please consider asking your legislators to support legalizing and regulating marijuana like alcohol. This fiscally sound approach would increase freedom, end the possibility of disparities in enforcement of possession, re-direct law enforcement resources to real crime, and allow the state to control and generate revenue from this lucrative product.

Given the benefits marijuana policy reform has — from allowing police to focus on real crime, to raising revenue through legalization and taxation, to improving seriously ill patients' well-being with medical marijuana — it should be just a matter of time before legislators and the governor's office catch up to the will of the voters.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine police used tear gas to disperse about 1,000 anti-U.S. protesters outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila on Wednesday, as television news footage showed a patrol van, which had come under attack, driving at demonstrators.
The rally came as President Rodrigo Duterte visits Beijing to strengthen relations with the world's second-largest economy amid deteriorating ties with the Philippines' former colonial power, the United States, sparked by his controversial war on illegal drugs.
Police made 29 arrests at the rally while at least 10 people were taken to hospital after being hit by the police van, Renato Reyes, secretary general of left-wing activist group Bayan (Nation), told reporters.

The protesters were calling for the removal of U.S. troops in the southern island of Mindanao.
"There was absolutely no justification (for the police violence)," Reyes said. "Even as the president avowed an independent foreign policy, Philippine police forces still act as running dogs of the U.S."

U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner expressed sympathy for those injured and wished them a quick recovery.
"The U.S. strongly supports democracy in the Philippines and supports the right to peaceful expression and demonstration. We call on all parties to engage in peaceful dialogue and exercise restraint,” he said.

In a series of conflicting statements, Duterte has insulted U.S. President Barack Obama and the U.S. ambassador in Manila for questioning his war on drugs, which has led to the deaths of 2,300 suspected users and pushers. He told Obama to "go to hell" and alluded to severing ties with Washington.
Then after weeks of anti-American rhetoric, Duterte said the Philippines would maintain its existing defense treaties and its military alliances.

The comments have left Americans and U.S. businesses in the Philippines jittery about their future.
A little over a decade ago, Lamborghini's V12 assembly line looked like a colorized version of the black-and-white photos in the company museum. A few milling machines hummed and spat white fluid while a skeleton crew casually bolted together Murcielago engines as if someone had replaced their espresso beans with decaf Folgers crystals. I recall seeing a middle-aged man with a five-o'clock shadow working a flat file against a cylinder head, cautiously deburring the freshly milled part. A few feet away, but 40 years into the future, the Gallardo assembly line hummed with the efficiency, if not the speed, of a plant churning out VW Golfs or Audi A4s.
Giuseppe Marescalchi, a Lamborghini employee since 1982, has seen the ups and downs of the tiny supercar maker. During his tenure, four different owners have cut his paychecks. But even as the company stumbled along, the cars remained legendary. Over the past 33 years, the Countach, Jalpa, Diablo, LM002, and Murcielago have left the tiny factory in rural Sant'Agata Bolognese. It occurs to me that there has never been a pushrod in the factory, ever.
Marescalchi is now the Aventador Engine Line Team Leader and my guide through the modernized V12 production process. Affable despite the language barrier, he is obviously proud of the engine line that now makes five fire-breathing 6.5-liter V12s per day. The new Huracan's V10 engine is made in Audi's Gyor, Hungary, plant and arrives in Italy fully dressed. It's a great engine for sure but, like pasta, it's just different when it's made in Italy.
Marescalchi learns through the interpreter about my 2004 visit and smiles. Much has changed, he tells me. The milling machines are gone and the engine arrives as a set of components ready for assembly. A flat-screen monitor hanging above the line counts down to assure that workers stay on the five-engine-per-day schedule. Marescalchi's right, it's completely different. No one has a file in hand.
At the first station the naked aluminum block meets the crankshaft and the pistons. The V-angle, the number of cylinders, and the firing order link the Aventador's 691-horsepower V12 to the past. Nothing else is shared with the old engine. Each piston head is married to a short-throw connecting arm. In goes the massive crankshaft that will be responsible for keeping the spinning bits inside the engine at the 8250-rpm power peak. Everything is clean, but workers wear black short-sleeved shirts and black pants. No one is wearing the equivalent of a HAZMAT suit, and there are no fake doctors on this floor, either; the engine is built right out in the open, not in a hyperbaric chamber, or climate-controlled "clean room," like the Nissan GT-R's twin-turbo V6.
In the next station, the heads go together. Hydraulic lifters, valves, and springs go in. The valve guides arrive already installed to avoid adding more labor to the factory floor. My futzing with the various steps in the process is beginning to slow down the line. The boss glances nervously at the countdown clock and moves me to the next stage lest I prevent the team from meeting its daily 3500-horsepower quota.
After the head is together, it slides toward the block on a hanger. Heads bolt to the block. My engine is taking shape, but the bumbling writer and interpreter combo has slowed down the line to a crawl. A decade ago, I doubt anyone would've cared, but today the schedule exists and the doomsday clock counts down until the workday is over. An electronic bundle of wires goes on. The direct-fuel-injection plumbing is fitted. We fast-forward to an already assembled engine and seven-speed gearbox, a leviathan more than six feet long that looks big enough to power a city bus. I'm allowed to snap a few ancillary items into place. The Lamborghini V12 engine is together. At least I didn't drop anything important.
At the end of the line is the crucible, the dynamometer room. Fresh off the line, every V12 goes in for a whipping to make sure it meets horsepower claims. Outside the room, a computer runs the test cycle. A monitor displays a spreadsheet showing the last twenty or so engines. Every one on the list is over 700 horsepower. A particularly strong one makes 718 horsepower. And then I spot the 738-horsepower reading. The interpreter asks about it. Marescalchi responds, "Super Veloce." He needs no translation. Lamborghini's Geneva auto-show reveal is already being tested built on the line.
Perhaps the line did all their deburring the day before my arrival, but it's more likely that the ghosts of production past have been exorcized. The V12 goes together efficiently and without a fuss, provided fumbling writers are not around. I'd guess that Marescalchi is relieved to have me off the factory floor. Lamborghini fantasy camp is over and an afternoon espresso tastes even better after a pretend day of work.
FRISCO, Texas -- Seventeen-year-old Christian Pulisic could start for the United States when the Copa America Centenario kicks off next week, U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said after Wednesday's 1-0 friendly win over Ecuador.
Pulisic, who burst onto the national team radar after breaking into German powerhouse Borussia Dortmund's first team earlier this year, played the final 27 minutes off the bench in his second appearance for the U.S., adding a spark that led to Darlington Nagbe's 90th minute game winner.

Lineups and Stats
"Everybody's in contention," Klinsmann said when asked if the Pennsylvania native could play a bigger role during the high-profile tournament. "It's nice to see a youngster like Christian having no fear, having confidence.
"It's also a confidence given by his teammates. He can make mistakes but he also has that change of pace. He has the technique. He's not overthinking the situation."
After being a substitute in his first two international appearances, Pulisic, who made four Bundesliga starts for Dortmund during the second half of their season, admitted that he would welcome a larger role with the U.S.
Christian Pulisic and Darlington Nagbe celebrate after the U.S. scored its winner vs. Ecuador.
"That's what I'm pushing for," Pulisic said. "We have 23 very strong players. Of course everyone wants to start. That's the goal, but I just want to be successful with the team. Whether that's starting or that's coming off the bench that's fine by me."
Pulisic was one of several young players who impressed in a substitute role in the second half, along with Nagbe and striker Bobby Wood.
It will make for stiff competition for places ahead of the Americans' June 3 tourney opener against Colombia.
"All 23 are ready to play from the beginning on, and they're fighting now for spots," Klinsmann said. "Yes, we have established players and they deserve a certain kind of [respect]. But we always tell the younger ones to come in and sooner or later push them out. It's their job."

But there is a deeper structural and philosophical reason why the Palestinians remain stateless—a reason more profound than the political narrative would indicate. It is best explained by associate Johns Hopkins professor Jakub Grygiel, in his brilliant essay, “The Power of Statelessness: the Withering Appeal of Governing” (Policy Review April/May 2009). In it, Grygiel does not discuss the Palestinians in particular, but rather the attitude of stateless people in general.
Statehood is no longer a goal, he writes. Many stateless groups “do not aspire to have a state,” for they are more capable of achieving their objectives without one. Instead of actively seeking statehood to address their weakness, as Zionist Jews did in an earlier phase of history, groups like the Palestinians now embrace their statelessness as a source of power.
New communication technologies allow people to achieve virtual unity without a state, even as new military technologies give stateless groups a lethal capacity that in former decades could be attained only by states. Grygiel explains that it is now “highly desirable” not to have a state—for a state is a target that can be destroyed or damaged, and hence pressured politically. It was the very quasi-statehood achieved by Hamas in the Gaza Strip that made it easier for Israel to bomb it. A state entails responsibilities that limit a people's freedom of action. A group like Hezbollah in Lebanon, the author notes, could probably take over the Lebanese state today, but why would it want to? Why would it want responsibility for providing safety and services to all Lebanese? Why would it want to provide the Israelis with so many tempting targets of reprisal? Statelessness offers a level of “impunity” from retaliation.
But the most tempting aspect of statelessness is that it permits a people to savor the pleasures of religious zeal, extremist ideologies, and moral absolutes, without having to make the kinds of messy, mundane compromises that accompany the work of looking after a geographical space.
Grygiel raises a challenging proposition. If his theory is correct, then the Palestinians may never have a state, because at a deep psychological level, enough of them—or at least the groups that speak in their name—may not really want one. Statehood would mean openly compromising with Israel, and, because of the dictates of geography, living in an intimate political and economic relationship with it. Better the glory of victimhood, combined with the power of radical abstractions! As a stateless people, Palestinians can lob rockets into Israel, but not be wholly blamed in the eyes of the international community. Statehood would, perforce, put an end to such license.
The closest that Israelis and Palestinians ever came to peace was at the end of the Clinton Administration in 2000, when then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of the center-left Labor Party offered a slew of concessions to the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat—only to have Arafat reject them. Arafat's epitaph was that he remained loyal to the cause of his people, that he never compromised, and that he was steadfast to the bitter end. He may have seen that as a more morally and emotionally satisfying conclusion to a life of statelessness than that of making the unenchanting concessions associated with achieving statehood.
With the SEC's Tuesday release of its men's basketball schedule for the 2016-17 season, we now know the Florida Gators schedule for the 2016-17 season. And while the Gators won't occupy the post-renovation O'Connell Center — now called Exactech Arena at the O'Connell Center — until late December for a non-conference game, the Gators' SEC home opener is going to be a big game.
That's because the Gators will host Mississippi — coach Mike White's alma mater — for that game, on January 3, the first game in 2017.
The rest of Florida's SEC schedule holds a couple of surprises. Most notably, the Gators won't be Kentucky's Senior Day opponent, instead seeing the Wildcats twice in February for Saturday clashes on CBS. (Kentucky will play Vanderbilt on Senior Day.)
But the Gators also netted an appealing set of home-and-home foes. Georgia, Kentucky, and Vanderbilt remain the Gators' three "permanent" opponents, and are joined by Arkansas and South Carolina. Those latter two teams will see Florida both early and late: They host the Gators over their first six SEC contests, then visit Gainesville over the final two weeks of SEC play.
Arkansas, specifically, will see Florida very early and very late. The Razorbacks host Florida on December 30, in the earliest SEC opener for the Gators since the 1988-89 season, when LSU came to the O'Connell Center on December 10. And just like that LSU team, the Gators won't see the Hogs again until March 1.
While Kentucky is a perennial power, and Vanderbilt was one of three SEC teams to make the 2016 NCAA Tournament, the four non-Kentucky teams in that quintet have all been more or less middle-of-the-pack outfits in recent years, and Vanderbilt lost (perhaps "lost") long-time coach Kevin Stallings to Pittsburgh this offseason.
This is an SEC schedule that sets up for an NCAA Tournament run, in other words.
The full Florida Gators men's basketball schedule for 2016-17 looks like this now.
Florida Gators Men's Basketball 2016-17 Schedule
American Atheists and two co-plaintiffs today filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Kentucky a lawsuit demanding that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stop giving preferential treatment to churches and religious organizations via the process of receiving non-profit tax-exempt status under the Internal Revue Code (IRC) procedures and definitions.
“American Atheists receives tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3),” said American Atheists President David Silverman, “but because the organization is not classified as religious it costs American Atheists, along with all other secular non-profits, significantly more money each year to keep that status. In this lawsuit, American Atheists and the other plaintiffs are demanding that all tax-exempt organizations, including those characterized as religious by the IRS, have the same requirements to achieve tax-exempt status.”
For example, in order to qualify for nonprofit tax-exempt status, any religious or secular organization must demonstrate it exists to benefit the public. After that basic element is established, religious non- profits are almost always declared automatically tax-exempt under the current IRC rules and definitions. However, secular non-profits face a lengthy application and a fee, which can be as high as $850.
PREMIER Jay Weatherill has labelled South Australia's unemployment rate of 8.2 per cent “deeply disturbing” but conceded it will likely get worse before it gets better.
SA's unemployment rate moved past 8 per cent in June for the first time in 15 years.
Mr Weatherill said the state was suffering from decline in the manufacturing sector, a high Australian dollar and falling commodity prices.
He called on the Federal Government to come to South Australia's aid with a “northern Adelaide plan” to counter job losses to come when Holden's Elizabeth factory ceases manufacturing in 2017.
“We are yet to consume the closure of Holden's and so it would be reasonable to assume that there are going to be many more challenging days ahead of us,” Mr Weatherill said.
“The period between now and the end of 2017 is not going to get any easier.
“We're going to have to run just to stay still, just to actually (replace) the number of jobs that will be lost in the South Australian economy with new jobs.
“I am going to offer many more challenging propositions to put before the South Australian community but I think people understand the size of the challenge and they do expect there to be difficult things to grapple with.”
ABS data out this morning shows a drop of almost 6000 jobs in one month.
The last time unemployment was as high in SA as it is now was the year 2000.
It is becoming obvious that the employment crisis is here to stay, with the trend rate — which smoothes out month to month volatility — rising to 7.8 per cent.
SA's jobs catastrophe has become a “human crisis”, according to the state's foremost business representative.
And the staggering speed of the downturn has shocked even the state's economic experts.
Business SA CEO Nigel McBride said “we can't rationalise it or justify it, we just have to deal with it on the facts”.
“This isn't just an economic crisis, it's a human crisis and the impact of this right across the state is starting to be felt,” he said.
“Sadly we don't see any reason why this is going to turn around.”
State Employment Minister Gail Gago issued a statement following the announcement (read it in full below).
She said the deterioration was a “real concern” and “as we move from a reliance on traditional manufacturing industries — coupled with collapsing commodities prices — we see South Australian unemployment rates really struggling”.
Associate Professor John Spoehr from the University of Adelaide said the result was particularly bad for men.
“In my view this is a male unemployment crisis,” he said.
The number of men employed in the state dropped by more than 8000 in June.
“It's been brewing for a while but now it's obvious that we are in the midst of a male unemployment crisis that will get much worse as the effects of the auto closure and downturn in construction impact over the next year or so,” Prof Spoehr said.
And the speed of the downturn — a full percentage point drop to the unemployment rate in just two months — has come as a shock.
“I didn't expect it to hit as hard as this as early as it has,” he said. “It's even surprised me.”
South Australia's unemployment rate is now 1.7 percentage points higher than any other state or territory as Tasmania's rate eased in June to 6.5 per cent.
In comparison the national unemployment rate increased just 0.1 percentage points to 6 per cent, and was steady on trend.
Mr McBride said the outlook was particularly bad for parts of regional South Australia such as Port Pirie or Port Augusta, which already face double digit unemployment.
“We're seeing a situation where there's a human cost,” he said.
“We're seeing it in mental health, we're seeing it in drug abuse and ice, we're seeing it across the board that there's no incentive for businesses to hire, to train.”
South Australian Centre for Economic Studies deputy director Steve Whetton said “it's not a story of jobs disappearing, it's much more a story of people entering in the labour force.”
He noted that jobs have grown faster than employment so far this year, and the rise in unemployment was due to a rise in the number of people looking for work — which is usually positive for the economy.
“It's obviously not great for the people who are trying to find work but it suggests the problems aren't as bad from the point of view of the state,” he said.
“It's a better reason to have a high unemployment rate.”
State Liberal employment spokesman David Pisoni described the result as “very disturbing”.
“These figures tell us we're in the middle of a jobs crisis here in South Australia and Jay Weatherill has no plan to fix it.”
Full Statement from Employment Minister Gail Gago
SOUTH Australia's headline unemployment rate for June is 8.2 per cent, according to new Labour Force figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
The national unemployment rate increased to 6 per cent.
“It's a real concern to see a further deterioration in unemployment rates around the nation, particularly with South Australia's rate increasing to 8.2 per cent,” Employment Minister Gail Gago said.
“As we move from a reliance on traditional manufacturing industries — coupled with collapsing commodities prices — we see South Australian unemployment rates really struggling.
“This is not helped by the Federal Government's withdrawal of support for our auto manufacturing and navy shipbuilding industries, not to mention severe Federal Budget cuts in the health and education sectors.
“The State Government will continue to work with business and industry to support employment growth and skill training in a transitioning economy so all South Australians have the chance to find work,” Ms Gago said.
Today's ABS figures show that South Australia recorded its highest level of employment and highest participation rate in two years.
Ms Gago said South Australians were actively participating in the job market and reaffirmed the need for bold action to create jobs.
“As the Premier has stated, we need to focus on transitioning South Australia from the old economy to the new economy, creating jobs for future generations of South Australians.
“That is exactly why our 2015-16 State Budget has allocated almost $985 million to support job creation, through reforming the tax system and investing in new and growth industries.
“The ABS figures show our participation rate has been increasing for 6 consecutive months, and June's rate of 62.5 per cent is the highest since July 2013.
“We also have marked the highest level of employment in two years.
“Total employment in the State has been rising for six consecutive months, for a total increase of 6100, or 1000 jobs a month,” Ms Gago said.
The 2015/16 State Budget focuses on job creation and includes:
BUSINESS tax cuts of $670 million including the abolishment of stamp duty on commercial property transactions, making South Australia the best place in the nation to do business;
STIMULUS for new industries of $315 million to grow the jobs of the future, including tourism and international education; and
A TOTAL infrastructure spends of $10.8 billion supporting an average of more than 4650 jobs per year including upgrades to schools, hospitals and a new Adelaide Festival Plaza.
Last week also saw a $180 million per annum saving for business with the WorkCover levy slashed from an average of 2.75% to 1.95%.
“There are signs that the State's economy is strengthening, including improving business confidence over the last two quarters and increases over the past year to high levels for retail sales, investment, housing construction and minerals and petroleum exploration expenditure.
“Our Budget forecasts South Australia returning to a long-term employment growth rate of 1.0 to 1.25 per cent for the next four years.”

Comedian George Lopez lashed out a female audience member who was apparently offended by his racially-charged jokes.
“There are only two rules in the Latino family,” Lopez said Saturday night during a live show in Phoenix. “Don't marry somebody black and don't park in front of our house.”
Video posted by TMZ shows a woman in the audience giving Lopez the middle finger and appearing to be offended by the comic's pun.
Lopez apparently saw the woman protesting his set and proceeded to offer her some pointed advice: “Sit your f*ckin' ass down! Sit your f*ckin' ass down! I'm talking, b*tch. You paid to see a show. So sit your f*cking ass down!”

But the former ABC star's harsh demands appeared to enrage the woman even more. Determined to take back control of his show, he doubled down: “You can't take a joke, you're in the wrong motherf*cking place,” he said as the crowd cheered him on.
“Sit your f*cking ass down or get the f*ck out of here,” Lopez warned.
Toward the end of the clip, Lopez apparently had the woman removed from the building.
“I tell you what, I'll make the choice for you. Get the f*ck out of here,” he said as the woman was escorted from her table. “Four seats just opened up front.”
The 55-year-old comedian appeared to address the controversy on his Twitter account Tuesday morning.
“You have 2 choices , have a good day or get the f*ck out,” he tweeted.

Whenever the Morgan Foundation mentions a new tax (such as the Comprehensive Capital Income Tax, or water charges, or a junk food tax), the inevitable response appears – No New Taxes!
This response tends to come from people who have a regressive, kneejerk opposition to change or a vested interest in opposing change. Either way, the public should not be persuaded by their arguments.
The fact is that the current already incentivizes certain behaviour, and discourages others. If we get the design of these incentives wrong (which we have), it can hamper our economy, health and the environment. Depending on how the revenue is spent, new taxes can make us richer, healthier, and reduce pollution.
If you tax it, people will do less of it
The basic rule of tax is that if you tax something people will do less of it.
At the moment we tax income, so people arrange their lives to get less income than they otherwise would. This is a change in behaviour that we don't want – a distortion – that isn't great for our economy.
The best way to overcome this is to make sure our tax system is as broad as possible (i.e. taxes as much different stuff as possible), but using a low rate. This reduces the distortionary effect of the taxation.
New taxes can help reduce distortions in a few ways. Firstly, they can help broaden the tax base, reducing other tax rates and thereby reducing the distortions that they cause. However, some taxes are even better than that – they are a win/win, because they can raise revenue while also reducing behaviour that is damaging to the economy, environment and our health.
New taxes can be used to reduce existing taxes
The first statement from the anti-tax brigade is often but we pay enough tax already!
And if they pay PAYE then they are right; the majority of wage and salary earners bear far too much of the tax burden in this country.
The fact is that half the wealthiest people in New Zealand don't even pay the top rate of income tax. The reason they don't pay much tax is because they are making use of the tax loopholes that exist around the income generated by wealth. That is why the Labour and Greens plans to increase the top rate of income tax would generate such a paltry return.
Those who criticise new taxes aren't thinking about the other side of that equation – how the revenue would be spent. The answer to those who think they pay too much tax is simple – we can use the revenue from new taxes to reduce the tax paid elsewhere.
For example, to compensate for a new tax we could drop income tax rates to ensure that most PAYE earners are better off from a new tax. When combined with tax cuts, new taxes like the Comprehensive Capital Income Tax or water charges would be hugely progressive.
New taxes can be good for the economy
Where there are tax loopholes, the money will flow. And so it is in New Zealand, where the tax loopholes around housing have led to us overinvest. Thanks to the easy availability of mortgage money this increases our exchange rate. This in turn is a double whammy for the productive sector, which simultaneously faces a high exchange rate and is starved of the money they need to grow.
Closing tax loopholes levels the tax playing field. This means that investment will go to where it generates the best return, instead of where it will get the best tax treatment. A tax on housing would see New Zealanders finally facing up to the reality that we can't get rich buying houses off each other – we actually have to produce stuff the world wants.
New taxes can be better for the environment
Often the actions of private individuals have much wider social costs. In economics we call these externalities. Where these go untaxed, private individuals tend to do more of the bad stuff than they would if they paid the true cost. One of the prime examples in New Zealand is dairy farming, which has created many negative impacts on water quality. If they had to pay for the water cleanup, there would certainly be less dairy farming around to create the problem in the first place.
The OECD argues that taxing negative externalities can actually make us all better off, in two ways. Not only can they reduce pollution giving us a better standard of living, but they can also encourage industries to operate in less polluting ways – a win-win for the environment and economy.
New taxes can be better for our health
Finally, taxes can be used to encourage healthy behaviour. We already see the benefits of this with smoking and alcohol excise taxes, however now junk food is as big a threat to our health as smoking is. A tax on junk food could either encourage people to consume less junk food – reducing the long term health bill – or if they keep consuming it acts as a form of user pays for the future health bill.

Hewlett-Packard has kicked off an ambitious project that aims at nothing less than reinventing the basic architecture of computers. It looks like servers are its initial target, but HP is also working on an Android version that it says could lead to smartphones with 100TB of storage.
HP said Wednesday it was working on a new computer architecture, dubbed The Machine, based on a type of memory called memristors and a communications technology called silicon photonics, which uses light beams to move data around at high speeds.
[ InfoWorld has your top picks: the best Windows 8 tablet laptops, convertibles, and Ultrabooks. | Cut to the key news for technology development and IT management with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter, our summary of the top tech happenings. ]
It's still a research project in HP's labs, and its not certain when -- if ever -- The Machine will make it to market. But HP is throwing a lot of resources at the problem -- as many as three-quarters of its labs staff are working on it -- and its estimates for delivery range from three years to the end of the decade.
HP believes the current computing architecture -- used in smartphones, PCs, and just about every other type of computer you can think of -- can't keep pace with expanding compute and storage needs. So it embarked on a project about two years ago to rethink computing from the ground up, CTO Martin Fink said at an HP conference in Las Vegas.
A key goal for The Machine is to replace the different storage technologies in use today with a single "universal memory" pool made from memristors, he said. That's a new type of memory, still at the research stage, that uses ions instead of electrons to represent the 1s and 0s of computer code.
"Today, all our devices -- from phone to supercomputer -- constantly shuttle information between three layers of memory: what's needed this instant (SRAM), what will be needed very soon (DRAM) and what may be needed later (storage)," HP said on its website.
"Memristors will be fast, dense and cheap enough to play both the 'soon' and 'later' roles at once, and thereby speed up throughput by eliminating most of the to and fro," it said.
How dense? "We want you to be able to store your entire life; think of 100 terabytes on your smartphone," Fink said. That's more than a thousand times the storage an iPhone 5S has today.
HP is also designing new, application-specific processors for its architecture. It envisions pools of processors and memory chips interconnected with photonic cables, which Fink said will carry data at up to 6TB per second.
Managing the new architecture will require new operating systems. HP is building a Machine OS from scratch, but it's also developing a version based on Linux and another with Google's mobile OS.
"What if we actually built a version of Android that was tuned and optimized for these nonvolatile memory systems? We have a team that's doing that too," Fink said.
He didn't say more about the mobile plans and HP's near-term focus is likely to be servers. But Paul Teich, senior analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said memristors could potentially replace DRAM and flash in smartphones, reducing their cost and improving performance and battery life.
More than that, with a single memory type, smartphones and tablets could access data in the cloud as easily as if it were on the device itself.
"After The Machine architecture and OS are in place, at some point in the future, the theory is that when you connect a memristor based Android device to a network with high enough bandwidth, it will become a node in a cloud with immediate access to the rest of that cloud," Teich said. "It's a different model of looking at device capabilities. Nothing will need to be 'downloaded' unless you plan to be disconnected from the larger network."
"There is a lot of work for HP to marshal for the next few years to make this happen," he added.

What is a Closure?
In a previous article on testing with Go there is an example that uses a closure to create table-driven tests. This is a fairly common practice in Go, but after writing the article a developer reached out to me and made the following comment.
“I learned something. Mainly that I have no idea how Go closures work”
Ouch! That means that despite the rest of the article being packed with great content on testing, if a reader didn't understand closures they weren't going to get the full benefit of the article.
This post is intended to fix that problem. In it I are going to discuss what closures are and why you should care about them. Then in a followup article, 5 Useful Ways to Use Closures in Go (redundant, I know), we will explore some of the more common use cases for closures to help give you ideas of where and when to use closures in your own code. Each use case has a specific example that I have encountered, so they aren't just imaginary uses.
Anonymous functions
Before we jump into closures, we need to first talk about anonymous functions. An anonymous function is the same as a regular old function, but it doesn't have a name - hence the term “anonymous”. Instead, an anonymous function is created dynamically, much like a variable is.
Like most things, this can be easier to explain with code. Below is what a normal function would look like.
func DoStuff () { // Do stuff }
If we wanted to turn this same function into an anonymous function, we wouldn't declare it quite the same way; rather than starting with the func keyword, we could instead create a variable that has a func() type. After doing this, we could create and assign an anonymous function to he variable.
var DoStuff func () = func () { // Do stuff }
There are a lot of subtle differences between these two, but for most practical purposes, the big difference is that we could assign a new function to the DoStuff variable at runtime, allowing us to dynamically change what DoStuff() does.
package main import "fmt" var DoStuff func () = func () { // Do stuff } func main () { DoStuff () DoStuff = func () { fmt . Println ( "Doing stuff!" ) } DoStuff () DoStuff = func () { fmt . Println ( "Doing other stuff." ) } DoStuff () }
If you run this program you would see the following output.
Doing stuff! Doing other stuff.
We are seeing two different lines of output because we declared three different anonymous functions, and the last two each are printing out something different.
Anonymous functions can accept parameters, return data, and do pretty much anything else a normal function can do. You can even assign a regular function to a variable just like you do with an anonymous function.
package main import "fmt" var DoStuff func () = func () { // Do stuff } func RegFunc () { fmt . Println ( "reg func" ) } func main () { DoStuff () DoStuff = RegFunc DoStuff () }
The only real difference between a regular function and an anonymous one is that anonymous functions aren't declared at a package level. They are declared more dynamically and are typically either used and then forgotten or are assigned to a variable for later use.
Closures
A closure is a special type of anonymous function that references variables declared outside of the function itself. That means that like in the previous examples, we will be creating a function dynamically, but in this case we will be using variables that weren't passed into the function as a parameter, but instead were available when the function was declared.
This is very similar to how a regular function can reference global variables. You aren't directly passing these variables into the function as a parameter, but the function has access to them when it is called.
Let's take a look at a closure in action. In this next example we are going to create a closure that keeps track of how many times it has been called, and returns that number.
package main import "fmt" func main () { n := 0 counter := func () int { n += 1 return n } fmt . Println ( counter ()) fmt . Println ( counter ()) }
If you were to run this code you would get the output:
1 2
Notice how our anonymous function has access to the n variable, but this was never passed in as a parameter when counter() was called. This is what makes it a closure!
Closures provide data isolation
One problem with the previous example is a problem that can also pop up when using global variables. Any code inside of the main() function has access to n , so it is possible to increment the counter without actually calling counter() . That isn't what we want; Instead we would rather have n isolated so that no other code has access to it.
To do this we need to look at another interesting aspect of closures, which is the fact that they can still reference variables that they had access to during creation even if those variables are no longer referenced elsewhere.
package main import "fmt" func main () { counter := newCounter () fmt . Println ( counter ()) fmt . Println ( counter ()) } func newCounter () func () int { n := 0 return func () int { n += 1 return n } }
In this example our closure references the variable n even after the newCounter() function has finished running. This means that our closure has access to a variable that keeps track of how many times it has been called, but no other code outside of the newCounter() function has access to this variable. This is one of the many benefits of a closure - we can persist data between function calls while also isolating the data from other code.

In a new interview with The Standard, Ed Droste gave a quick update on how the new Grizzly Bear album is coming along. “We're feeling more adventurous with the sonic directions, changing it up a little bit — not like, a techno dance album … it's in the beginning stages,” he said. “Only a couple songs have started to take shape and it's gotta be like, a good dozen or so before we get the picture.” And with the band now split between the two coasts, they're still figuring out how they'll come back together to record:
That's a huge question mark. I would be lying if I said it didn't cause great anxiety. When I'm stressed about it, I have to remember that every time we try to do a new album I have huge anxiety. Every time it's like, ‘Woah, that was a crazy process, we have to do something different.'
Grizzly Bear's last album, Shields, came out back in 2012.
Poodle Drops From The Sky In Canada
Um… WHAT?
A tiny poodle survived a horrific fall after crash landing on the yard of a nursing home in Canada.
The dog was taken into the sky by an eagle trying to eat it. The dog (named May) must have fought it's way out of the bird's claws before taking the dive.
Doctors suspect May, who is about six years old, was a stray because her nails were overgrown and her teeth were severely decayed.
“We don├óΓé¼Γäót know how long she had been wandering without care but she was obviously very neglected. It├óΓé¼Γäós ironic, but this bird may have saved her life,”
British Columbia Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals manager Shannon Broderick said in a statement.

How Big is Bitcoin in Japan? Hype Versus Reality
You've probably heard a lot about the promise of bitcoin in Japan. Some of it is true, but there's also a lot of hyperbole, expectation and plain old hype. When you go exploring at street level, you find some challenges and unexpected surprises.
Also read: Amazon Cash Lets Customers Shop Online Without Credit Cards
A group from Chinese bitcoin company BitKan recently visited Tokyo on a mission part promotional and part fact-finding. BitKan, which has an app and escrow service designed to facilitate OTC (over-the-counter) bitcoin trading between individuals, needed to see whether people in Japan were actually using bitcoin. And if so, then who and how?
Why Does Attention Keep Turning Back to Japan?
New regulations which further legitimize bitcoin use came into effect in Japan at the beginning of this month. While stopping short of recognizing bitcoin as an official currency, they introduce new consumer protections and audit requirements for exchanges. This is likely to prompt an uptick in trading activity in a country that already loves FX.
One of Japan's biggest brick-and-mortar retailers, Bic Camera, announced it would trial bitcoin payments at two flagship stores in Tokyo. If successful, it could see a flurry of other retailers embracing digital currency.
Eyes also turned towards Japan again after the Chinese government placed new restrictions on bitcoin exchanges there. If Asian traders couldn't reliably withdraw funds from Chinese exchanges, would they look to the next-biggest market?
Add all this to the fact that the Japanese government has always seemed particularly tolerant of Bitcoin technology. Despite the Mt. Gox disaster that damaged bitcoin's reputation early on, the government has never sought to restrict activity.
Many Japanese Bitcoiners Are Actually Chinese
The first surprising fact that BitKan learned in Tokyo is that Chinese expats are a significant part of the community. Most prominent is the Japan-based exchange BTCBox, founded by Chinese expat David Zhang.
BitKan's Sandy Liang told BitsOnline that her team were surprised to find that several large and regular bitcoin traders in Japan were actually Chinese.
“Price fluctuations mean there's often a difference between the prices in Chinese and Japanese markets,” she said. “Depending on where it is this week, if you're able to trade in both countries there are opportunities for arbitrage.”
BitKan's model is a perfect fit for Japan's new regulation, she said. As a P2P trading platform the company never holds customers' funds. Similar to a service like Uber, users use the mobile app to find other individuals they want to do business with, and trade directly. BitKan just makes sure both parties are satisfied with the trade before releasing the funds to parties.
What's Bitcoin Use Like on the Street in Japan?
Coinmap shows bitcoin-accepting businesses all over Japan, and around 50 in the Tokyo area. But outside of FX trading, is the local bitcoin economy really so active?
Liang said it wasn't as easy to use bitcoin in Tokyo as she and her team had expected. Some listed venues rejected bitcoin payment altogether, while others said it was rare for customers to ask.
“The bartender at Hacker's Bar in Roppongi told us he gets maybe one request to pay in bitcoin per month,” she said. “In a couple of other places it was difficult for us as tourists to ask, as none of the staff could speak anything other than Japanese. This happened at one sushi restaurant listed on Coinmap.”
Bitcoin-accepting businesses could probably attract more bitcoin customers by putting up more signs and stickers advertising the option, she added. During the team's visit, they spoke to investor and evangelist Roger Ver at his Tokyo office, and also to a lawyer who consulted bitcoin companies on compliance with Japan's new digital currency regulations.
There were a few other hurdles: Family Mart convenience stores said they couldn't accept bitcoin as payment, and an attempt to pay with bitcoin at a Mexican restaurant failed due to a problem with the restaurant's payment system.
Awareness Still Higher than Actual Use
The BitKan team did find one curious case: a kimono rental store for tourists in the Asakusa historic district.
“The guy who worked there was actually Chinese, and said he'd had the BitKan app on his phone for two or three years. He used to own some bitcoins but sold them off after the Gox affair.”
“He's been monitoring the price ever since. He always wanted to jump back in but the price keeps going higher and higher. Now he's waiting to see whether it crashes hard again, for the chance to buy some again.”
In Tokyo and elsewhere around the world, bitcoin curiosity remains far higher than actual usage. Perhaps it's price movements, security concerns or just a need to know more about the technology. BitKan's experience showed that awareness is increasing, but bitcoin still remains highly experimental.
That situations present some hurdles to jump, but also plenty of opportunities for businesses who get the formula right.
Do you see Japan as a promising market for Bitcoin? Let's year your thoughts in the comments.

For the past few days, I've been diving deep into testing Drupal 8's experimental new BigPipe feature, which allows Drupal page requests for authenticated users to be streamed and loaded in stages—cached elements (usually the majority of a page) are loaded almost immediately, meaning the end user can interact with the main elements on the page very quickly, then other uncacheable elements are loaded in as Drupal is able to render them.
Here's a very quick demo of an extreme case, where a particular bit of content takes five seconds to load; BigPipe hugely improves the usability and perceived performance of the page by streaming the majority of the page content from cache immediately, then streaming the harder-to-generate parts as they become available (click to replay):
Drupal BigPipe demo - click to play again.
BigPipe takes advantage of streaming PHP responses (using flush() to flush the output buffer at various times during a page load), but to ensure the stream is delivered all the way from PHP through to the client, you need to make sure your entire webserver and proxying stack streams the request directly, with no buffering. Since I maintain Drupal VM and support Apache and Nginx as webservers, as well as Varnish as a reverse caching proxy, I experimented with many different configurations to find the optimal way to stream responses through any part of this open source stack.
And because my research dug up a bunch of half-correct, mostly-untested assumptions about output buffering with PHP requests, I figured I'd set things straight in one comprehensive blog post.
Testing output buffering
I've seen a large number of example scripts used to test output_buffering on Stack Overflow and elsewhere, and many of them assume output buffering is disabled completely. Rather than doing that, I decided to make a little more robust script for my testing purposes, and also to document all the different bits for completeness:
<?php
// Set a valid header so browsers pick it up correctly.
header ( 'Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8' );
// Emulate the header BigPipe sends so we can test through Varnish.
header ( 'Surrogate-Control: BigPipe/1.0' );
// Explicitly disable caching so Varnish and other upstreams won't cache.
header ( "Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate" );
// Setting this header instructs Nginx to disable fastcgi_buffering and disable
// gzip for this request.
header ( 'X-Accel-Buffering: no' );
$string_length = 32 ;
echo 'Begin test with an ' . $string_length . ' character string...<br />' . "\r
" ;
// For 3 seconds, repeat the string.
for ( $i = 0 ; $i < 3 ; $i ++) {
$string = str_repeat ( '.' , $string_length );
echo $string . '<br />' . "\r
" ;
echo $i . '<br />' . "\r
" ;
flush ();
sleep ( 1 );
}
echo 'End test.<br />' . "\r
" ;
?>
If you place this file into a web-accessible docroot, then load the script in your terminal using PHP's cli, you should see output like (click to replay):
PHP response streaming via PHP's CLI - click to play again.
And if you view it in the browser? By default, you won't see a streamed response. Instead, you'll see nothing until the entire page loads (click to replay):
PHP response not streaming via webserver in the browser - click to play again.
That's good, though—we now have a baseline. We know that the script works on PHP's CLI, but either our webserver or PHP is not streaming the response all the way through to the client. If you change the $string_length to 4096, and are using a normal PHP/Apache/Nginx configuration, you should see the following (click to replay):
PHP response streaming via webserver in the browser - click to play again.
The rest of this post will go through the steps necessary to ensure the response is streamed through your entire stack.
PHP and output_buffering
Some guides say you have to set output_buffering = Off in your php.ini configuration in order to stream a PHP response. In some circumstances, this is useful, but typically, if you're calling flush() in your PHP code, PHP will flush the output buffer immediately after the buffer is filled (the default value is 4096 , which means PHP will flush it's buffer in 4096 byte chunks).
For many applications, 4096 bytes of buffering offers a good tradeoff for better transport performance vs. more lively responses, but you can lower the value if you need to send back much smaller responses (e.g. tiny JSON responses like {setting:1} ).
One setting you definitely do need to disable, however, is zlib.output_compression . Set it to zlib.output_compression = Off in php.ini and restart PHP-FPM to make sure gzip compression is disabled.
There are edge cases where the above doesn't hold absolutely true... but in most real-world scenarios, you won't need to disable PHP's output_buffering to enable streaming responses.
Nginx configuration
I recommend using Nginx with PHP-FPM for the most flexible and performant configuration, but still run both Apache and Nginx in production for various reasons. Nginx has a small advantage over Apache for PHP usage in that it doesn't have the cruft of the old mod_php approach where PHP was primarily integrated with the webserver, meaning the proxied request approach (using FastCGI) has always been the default, and is well optimized.
All you have to do to make streaming responses work with Nginx is set the header X-Accel-Buffering: no in your response. Once Nginx recognizes that header, it automatically disables gzip and fastcgi_buffering for only that response.
header('X-Accel-Buffering: no');
You can also manually disable gzip ( gzip off ) and buffering ( fastcgi_buffering off ) for an entire server directive, but that's overkill and would harm performance in any case where you don't need to stream the response.
Apache configuration
Because there are many different ways of integrating PHP with Apache, it's best to discuss how streaming works with each technique:
mod_php
Apache's mod_php seems to be able to handle streaming without disabling deflate/gzip for requests out of the box. No configuration changes required.
mod_fastcgi
When configuring mod_fastcgi , you must add the -flush option to your FastCgiExternalServer directive, otherwise if you have mod_deflate /gzip enabled, Apache will buffer the entire response and delay until the end to deliver it to the client:
# If using PHP-FPM on TCP port 9000.
FastCgiExternalServer /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5-fcgi -flush -host 127.0.0.1:9000 -pass-header Authorization
mod_fcgi
I've never configured Apache and PHP-FPM using mod_fcgi , and it seems cumbersome to do so; however, according to the Drupal BigPipe environment docs, you can get output buffering disabled for PHP responses by setting:
FcgidOutputBufferSize 0
mod_proxy_fcgi
If you use mod_proxy_fcgi with PHP-FPM, then you have to disable gzip in order to have responses streamed:
SetEnv no-gzip 1
In all the above cases, PHP's own output buffering will take effect up to the default output_buffering setting of 4096 bytes. You can always change this value to something lower if absolutely necessary, but in real-world applications (like Drupal's use of BigPipe), many response payloads will have flushed output chunks greater than 4096 bytes, so you might not need to change the setting.
Varnish configuration
Varnish buffers output by default, and you have to explicitly disable this behavior for streamed responses by setting do_stream on the backend response inside vcl_backend_response . Drupal, following Facebook's lead, uses the header Surrogate-Control: BigPipe/1.0 to flag a response as needing to b streamed. You need to use Varnish 3.0 or later (see the Varnish blog post announcing streaming support in 3.0), and make the following changes:
Inside your Varnish VCL:
sub vcl_backend_response {
...
if (beresp.http.Surrogate-Control ~ "BigPipe/1.0") {
set beresp.do_stream = true;
set beresp.ttl = 0s;
}
}
Then make sure you output the header anywhere you need to stream a response:
header('Surrogate-Control: BigPipe/1.0');
Debugging output streaming
During the course of my testing, I ran into some strange and nasty networking issue with a VMware vagrant box, which was causing HTTP responses delivered through the VM's virtual network to be buffered no matter what, while responses inside the VM itself worked fine. After trying to debug it for an hour or two, I gave up, rebuilt the VM in VirtualBox instead of VMware, couldn't reproduce the issue, then rebuilt again in VMware, couldn't reproduce again... so I just put that there as a warning—your entire stack (including any OS, network and virtualization layers) has to be functioning properly for streaming to work!
To debug PHP itself, and make sure PHP is delivering the stream even when your upstream webserver or proxy is not, you can analyze packet traffic routed through PHP-FPM on port 9000 (it's a lot harder to debug via UNIX sockets, which is one of many reasons I prefer defaulting to TCP for PHP-FPM). I used the following command to sniff port 9000 on localhost while making requests through Apache, Nginx, and Varnish:
tcpdump -nn -i any -A -s 0 port 9000
In information warfare, or any aspect of war for that matter, there is a major difference between gathering information and intelligence and acting upon it.
While the issue appears to be bipartisan, with senators and representatives of both sides of the aisle condemning reports of Russian hacking, there are many people, including President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE, who are either questioning the attribution or trivializing the hacking by saying that Russia only exposed embarrassing information.
The problem is that it doesn't matter what the information was; it mattered that Russia, authorized by President Vladimir Putin, consciously chose to leak the information.
There is actually a very clear line in the information warfare field, which is now being referred to as Cyber Network Operations (CNO). As discussed in my book, "Advanced Persistent Security," CNO is divided into Cyber Network Defense (CND), Cyber Network Exploitation (CNE) and Cyber Network Attack (CNA).
CND involves securing your own systems and networks. CNE is essentially computer-based espionage, where you use computers to gather information. Clearly, the stealing for information from the Democratic National Committee and the other parties was CNE.
The fact is that all countries perform some level of CNE, and it is expected that if you leave information vulnerable, it will be compromised by someone. Usually there is no retaliation for CNE, as it is not directly impactful to the country compromised. We expect Russia to attempt to steal/hack U.S. secrets, and Russia expects the U.S. to attempt to steal/hack Russian secrets.
ADVERTISEMENT
It is, of course, a different story if you are caught in the act.
While it is expected, if one party is caught, there may be some level retribution. Such has been the case of traditional espionage, where known operatives are declared persona non grata and therefore exposed and ordered to leave the host country.
However, what Russia did went beyond information gathering and went as far as to release information stolen information, create fake information and spread fake information created by other parties. That is CNA. It was the active use of information to accomplish a political goal.
Let me be clear: I doubt that Russian CNA was the definitive act that swayed the election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE was definitely a flawed candidate and if any external force had an impact on the election, it could be argued that FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyExpect little closure on collusion 'Dear Attorney General Barr': Advice from insiders Rosenstein: My time at DOJ is 'coming to an end' MORE's actions were much more impactful than Russian actions.
That is irrelevant, though. Russia did actively attempt to achieve a political goal through committing computer crimes against U.S. entities and using the internet to spread real and fake information. That is an attack to achieve political goals, be it to support Trump or to damage Clinton.
It doesn't matter what the specific goal was.
It doesn't matter which side you're on.
Frankly, at this point, Trump now has a higher bar to overcome, as he has to demonstrate there is not a conflict of interest and he is not "Putin's pawn" as Clinton claimed he would be during the debates.
He cannot be perceived as using or ignoring a foreign power that committed crimes that benefited him.
While some people make the argument that the U.S. has likewise actively attempted to interfere in the political affairs of other countries — and I would agree with that — that is also completely irrelevant. Any potential victims of U.S. interference are within their rights to retaliate. However, those countries would have to deal with the U.S. response.
I do not fault Russia in principle for wanting to use CNA to accomplish political goals, but Russian actions require retaliation on the part of the U.S. government. A crime is a crime, and a crime to attempt to compromise the foundation of the U.S. political system is CNA.
To fail to take action would only invite further CNA by Russia and other countries.

‘More openness toward multiracial people is next policy target'
By Kim Se-jeong
Kim Hee-jung, minister of
gender equality and family
The government will put a greater focus on correcting prejudiced views of multiracial families and boosting the public's receptivity of them, said Minister of Gender Equality and Family Kim Hee-jung in a recent interview.
Her remarks show the ministry's policy focus shifting from the current policy of helping marriage migrants adapt to life here over the last decade.
"The policy has come a long way, but what's more important now is for Korean society to embrace these multicultural families more heartily," Kim said. "We will make greater efforts to raise public awareness that these families bring openness and flexibility to Korean society."
One such effort was the revision of the Multicultural Families Support Act passed earlier this month. The new law stipulates that services for multiracial families would no longer always be free.
A majority of immigrant wives in Korea are from other Asian countries such as China, Vietnam, Mongolia and Japan. While Koreans often regard them as lower-class citizens in need of help, many are reluctant to help them, believing that the immigrant population places a burden on their own opportunities for welfare.
One support program for marriage migrants is a home-visit service, in which Korean language instructors and social workers visit the family to teach the Korean language or give counseling to make cultural integration smoother.
"So far, all foreign spouses received the home-visit service for free regardless of income level," the minister said. "But under the revision, this will change and multiracial families in mid- and high-income brackets will pay for the service. I believe this will help people see these families as more than just recipients of social benefits."
The revised law also makes it mandatory for teachers and heads of childcare centers and kindergartens to take action to protect children from multiracial backgrounds from discrimination. The ministry is working on more details.
Past and future
As the marriage immigrant population grew, so too did the need for effective policies.
According to the ministry, there are almost 300,000 migrant spouses in Korea, mostly women, and they are estimated to have had around 200,000 children. The ministry expects 1 million people will have multiracial families by 2020.
The government began to offer support programs for them in 2006 when the flow of marriage migrants reached its peak, with bachelors in rural areas looking for wives from other Asian countries.
The growing trend had various downsides, such as family conflicts arising from the foreign spouses' difficulties adapting to a new culture and relationship.
The government began offering help to marriage migrants through 217 multicultural family support centers. The centers have proven effective, helping reduce such conflicts.
Marking the 10th anniversary of the government's policy for multiracial families this year, Kim said the future policy focus for the next 10 years will be on children, especially those who join their parent in Korea later after the parent married a Korean citizen.
"These children are more vulnerable to identity crises, and it's very critical to help them grow without major trouble," she said.
One of the support programs is the Rainbow School, with 17 branches around the country offering information about Korea, Korean language education and academic assistance to new arrivals.
The ministry also runs a multi-language program, aiming at increasing fluency of multiracial children in Korean and the language of the immigrant parent. "We hope these children will be a bridge between Korea and the country of their parent," the minister said.
Some 6,800 children have participated in the multi-language program, and the government will make a database of the participants' profiles to support their further academic and job careers.
Everyone is talking about chatbots these days. Telegram has them, Facebook got them recently, Slack has them and many more wants them (for a good reason). It was time to figure out what these chatbots are and how they can help and make life easier.
We are at a point where artificial intelligence is a big thing again. Recent movies like “Ex Machina” and “Her” pictured super smart and dangerous AI-driven bots that could easily become a threat to humanity. At the same time, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates Warn About Artificial Intelligence, we are reading about self driving cars or about Google beating a world champion in Go with their bot. And suddenly, we don't know anymore how far we are from this depicted alternative future. And then there comes a new hype about chatbots. A multi-billion dollar hype. No wonder, fear and expectations are quite high.
UPDATE: Telegram just announced a $1,000,000 challenge for bot developers!
perfect timing!
Feel free to use my code and build an exciting project for the challenge!
https://telegram.org/blog/botprize
Chatbot Status Quo
Browsing through the list of available bots, however, one will find little innovation but see a recognizable pattern: saturation is nothing app specific. It seems many developers missed the initial app gold rush and are now jumping on the bandwagon named “Bots are the new apps. The bot store is the new app store.”
When the Web had its ‘Appification' at some point, apps see a ‘Botification' these days. It works like this: take a successful app (name), append ‘bot' to the end, add AI to the description tags and wait for success. But it doesn't work like this. Users don't work like this. They are not stupid.
…death to the bots
These bots are not just useless as they are not providing any additional value but they also clash with the expectations we've developed from reading the news. Most users don't want a command line interface where they could have a shiny, simple to use and UX-tested app instead (unless they are mega-nerds or masochists). And users sense when they are fooled and it makes them angry… and everyone knows what happens when users don't like bots anymore..
HitchBOT, hitchhiking robot, gets beheaded in Philly
But who am I to complain a lot about bots? I'm not a journalist. I'm an engineer, so I better develop a better solution or stfu.
Building Intelligent Bots
While a “cats and titties” bot can provide fun for some time there should be more and we should aspire to build something more meaningful. If users want AI they should get AI! Right? But how hard is it for someone to put true artificial intelligence into a chatbot? I mean artificial intelligence is a very scientific discipline with some of the brightest computer scientists and mathematicians working on it for almost 60 years now. The answer is: it requires 50 lines of code.
But first, lets find a good use case. As described above, the botification of an already successful app introduces more pain than relief. So what could be a good use case in the context of chat, relevant for the broad mass and not just productivity nazis or angry support seeking customers?
Featured CBM: How to Make a Chatbot Intelligent?
The Problem: Voice Messages
Many chats do have a voice message feature. The reason is obvious: typing is not the most joyful task on your smartphone keyboard and often it is just easier and faster to speak your thoughts into the chat. However, it isn't joyful listening to all these voice messages either. Sometimes, you are in a quiet space or meeting or you just can't stand the voice of one of your friends. And then there are times where you are searching through the chat history and you need this piece of information: should I buy milk or was it yoghurt - but you can't find the answer within all these voice messages.
The Solution: A Speech-2-Text Bot
Speech recognition is considered an AI-hard problem And now I had this problem and wanted a solution. And while writing a speech recognition engine from scratch would have been an ambitious undertaking for my weekend project it seemed reasonable to try to build a chatbot that has some help from… Watson.
If we measure the intelligence of a bot we either compare to human intelligence or the smartest bot on the planet. The smartest bot on the planet is of course Watson. Watson was able to win jeopardy (must be the smartest) and it was broadcasted on TV (so we know Watson). Easy. ;-)
Setting up Watson
Watson has an API. I signed up for 30 days trial. The hardest part was actually getting the account working. A rule of thumb is that if you haven't seen a feature in the Web interface yet, it will not work in the cl tools. So first setup your company and region to avoid errors and click a little bit in the Web UI. Then follow this guide:
The documentation is quite easy to read and understand. At some point you create a speech-to-text service through the command line. Head back to Web interface, find the newly created service and obtain the credentials. Done.
Setting up a Telegram Bot
Setting up a Telegram bot is super easy and straight forward. First, add the BotFather to your contacts. use the /newbot command and follow through the instructions. Write down your API token. Done.
An Ai Bot in 50 Lines of Code
So here are the 50 lines of code that enable your bot to understand speech:
Short and hacky enough for a hackathon.
Try It Out
You can try out my bot i.e. Watson by adding @speech2textbot (https://telegram.me/speech2textbot) to your contacts or any chat or groupchat in telegram. Supported languages are: ar-AR, en-UK, en-US, es-ES, ja-JP, pt-BR, zh-CN.
When added to a group chat it will automatically create a transcript of all voice messages. You can also forward voice messages to it if not added to the conversation. The result should look like this:
The code is open source, feel free to use it and create your own bot that for example translates voice messages into different languages: Speech-To-Text-> Translation -> Text-To-Speech. All APIs are available through Watson. Share your ideas or requests in the comments.
Conclusion
Building intelligent bots is not too hard
Providing different interfaces such as speech input makes the experience with your app more comfortable and interesting
Having the right use case is key
Apps and bots have different context. It makes no sense to turn every app into a bot
As so often, don't trust the hype. While the science behind AI is making insane progress the practical results are not as good as in the Hollywood movies. Don't be disappointed.
Try before you buy: use my bot to test how good Watson really is ;-)
We've come a long way with apps- give bots a chance:

He has a blog on bitcrunch.de and is now trying out Medium.
Even the government that introduced it has all but stopped pretending that, nearly a decade into its existence, the Universal Child Care Benefit is really about child care.
When Stephen Harper's Conservatives first campaigned on a new monthly payment for parents, that was all it was supposed to be about. Unlike a Liberal attempt to establish a new national daycare program, the Tories' less bureaucratic plan was supposed to help create new spaces and give families more flexibility in finding arrangements.
By this week's "Christmas in July" expansion of the program that produced a lump-sum pre-election payment, the UCCB had come to provide funding not just for each kid under the age of six, but those up to 17. And the Conservatives have made clear they no longer care much how the money is spent.
Story continues below advertisement
"A family with two kids should receive as much as $1,000 today," a government press release enthused on Monday. "Parents can spend this money on anything they choose, including child care services, back-to-school supplies, sports activities and much more, boosting the economy and creating jobs across Canada."
To many Conservative supporters, that will sound just fine. From the outset, much of the UCCB's appeal has been that it applies to stay-at-home parents, not just those who pay for child care.
But the tacit admission of what the UCCB really is (or is not) also indicates a potential vulnerability for the Conservatives among swing voters, and a potential opening for other parties – the NDP in particular, at the moment – willing to revisit national daycare.
Much of the basis for the middle-class angst the Liberals and the New Democrats are trying to stir up before October's election is debatable. But anyone who knows young and prospective parents, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver and their suburbs, knows anxiety about being able to afford to have children is very real.
Even for two-parent families with above-average incomes, the prospect of paying upwards of $15,000 annually for one child's daycare is daunting; having two kids who need it is terrifying.
The taxable $160 that the UCCB now offers per child monthly is only a fraction of that cost. The same goes for other credits offered by the federal and provincial governments outside Quebec, the lone province to subsidize daycare. This week's $500 retroactive top-up is a drop in the bucket.
Much of this may have been obvious back in 2006. But in the death throes of Paul Martin's government, Canadians doubted the Liberals could deliver much of anything. The Conservatives' direct assistance, combined with their (since little-discussed) promise to create 125,000 new child-care spaces with assorted incentives, at least seemed achievable.

Story continues below advertisement
The worry for the Tories should be that – because time has passed, daycare has got more expensive, and other factors such as mounting real estate prices and longer commutes have added to the pressure – the pendulum has swung to the point where voters are willing to consider something more ambitious again.
That, certainly, is what Thomas Mulcair's New Democrats are counting on, as they promise $15-per-day child care. And Justin Trudeau's Liberals, who have tried to trump the Tories by promising a bigger child benefit for all but the highest earners, have left the door open to a more narrowly targeted daycare program as well.
Plenty of other policy concerns could trump this one, as could fear of taking on big new projects amid economic uncertainty. But it is easy to forget that, in coming to power, the Tories not only survived but actually won a debate about who could deliver child care. These days, they are barely even engaging in it.
If you find yourself filling up your iPhone with screenshots and wasting storage space, then you might be interested in this new app called Screeny. Screeny does one thing, and it does it well: it scans your Camera Roll for screenshots and lets you delete them in one fell swoop, saving you the time to manually browse through your entire library, and most importantly, helping you save precious storage space on your device.
After granting permission to the app to access your photo library, Screeny will scan it and indicate how much storage you could save if you deleted all screenshots found. From there, you have the option to manually select those screenshots you want to delete, or you can automatically select all screenshots except those from the last 15 or 30 days, and of course you can select all screenshots at once.
Once you've selected the screenshots you want to get rid of, tap the trash icon, confirm you indeed want to delete them and they'll be deleted from your Camera Roll. That doesn't mean you've saved storage space quite yet, because the deleted screenshots have been moved to the Recently Deleted album of the Photos app. To regain storage space, you'll have to go the Recently Deleted album and delete them from there, or you could just wait 30 days for iOS 8 to automatically delete them from the album.
Screeny is a great utility for users that frequently take screenshots and might forget about them. If you have a large library of photos, going through it all could be a tedious task. That's where Screeny comes in handy.
Screeny is $0.99 in the App Store. It will not appeal to everyone, but it will certainly save plenty of time to frequent screenshot takers.

I received an important report from my field operative. Here is the summary:
After 4 years the A.M.A.Z.O.N search algorithm I designed pulled coordinates for three artifacts. The first was retrieved after operation 'Toro' was successful. Here is the report:
After para-osmosis to slide 432 140, we appeared what looked like a lab or control room
we appeared what looked like a lab or control room 3 colleagues suffered 'splicing' during the para-osmosis, which indicates the lab was moving.
We were confronted by two civilians in combat suits connected to the room. They were subdued
One civilian was 432 150
The artifact was embedded in a control panel
Lyra was able to contain the artifact and bring it back safely through slide 1
Finally, expect a report on operation 'Martin' very soon.
Kubrick "Vigilamus"
This is a very imaginative code about what my secret santa is doing! Operation 'Toro' refers to my first gift - Pacific Rim on blu-ray -- directed by Guillarmo Del Toro.
I don't know what Operation 'Martin' refers to though! My amazon wishlist had Pacific Rim, and many others: http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/1ORDSNG2PDKYE but I suspect something from George R.R. Martin, such as the figurines or graphic novels!
EDIT: Artefact 2 (from Project 'Martin') arrived and it's a pop figure of Jon Snow from Game of Thrones! The story that came with it talks of the battle at ruby ford (pretty cool story!) and the next and final mission is project 'Touko'. I suspect Breaking Bad, but I don't have that on my wish list, so I am very keen to see what arrives!
Parcel 3 just arrived with a final note explaining this amazing story about amalgamation of gifts sought by alternative versions of myself, to become part of human conscious, just like Santa himself has done. It has been a very imaginative and well thought through sci-fi christmas story and I absolutely love it! (Gifter, are you a writer?) and my final gift is amazing, the board game eclipse! I am absolutely blown over by the generosity and the creativity of my gifter!!
Thank you very much! I just need to find out your username now!
In addition to my job as a researcher and a department chair, I run the Talking Biotech science communication program designed to help students, faculty and staff become conversant in how to talk about, and teach, biotechnology concepts. It has evolved into an effective and in-demand program.
The program and its funding were discussed in Nature on August 6, 2015, by Keith Kloor, and I felt additional clarification might be helpful. I've found support from several corporate entities, including Monsanto. They provided funds for 12 of my outreach talks and sponsored a larger multi-speaker workshop. Monsanto had no control of content, no suggestions on what we'd teach, but funded facilities charges, lunch, and speakers' travel. That stuff is expensive. But Monsanto does not, and never has, funded my research in any way.
Who else funds my outreach work? When I give talks I do not accept an honorarium. I feel that it is my job to provide talks free of charge, as a public scientist. When I do speak, I request that an appropriate donation be made to my outreach program. This account contains kind donations from the US Pork Board, an LED company, Manitoba Canola Growers, Mosaic Co, and others.
My outreach program slides are online at http://www.slideshare.net/kevinfolta/presentations. You can see that they are 100 percent supported by scientific evidence. This is about teaching scientists how to talk about science. While it will be spun by many to be some source of undue collusion, the content is factual, based on evidence, and in line with scientific consensus. One hundred percent of funds go to defray travel costs, buy a tray of subs for the students, and pay fees for facility rental.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has apologized on behalf of the city for the racist taunts that Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said he was subjected to during a Monday night game at Fenway Park, according to CBS Boston.
“Something like this doesn't belong in sports,” Walsh told the station. “I wish we could find out who these people were or who this person was that says this. If they claim to be a sports fan, they're not a sports fan–nothing but a racist.”
Jones said someone threw a bag of peanuts at him while he was on the field and he was, “called the ‘N' word a handful of times.”

The Red Sox also apologized to Jones Tuesday, with team president Sam Kennedy saying in a statement a review of the incident is ongoing and that any such conduct should be immediately reported to security.
“The Red Sox have zero tolerance for such inexcusable behavior, and our entire organization and our fans are sickened by the conduct of an ignorant few,” Kennedy said.
In a statement on Twitter, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker called the fan behavior “unacceptable” and “shameful.”
Fenway fans behavior at the #RedSox game last night was unacceptable & shameful. This is not what Massachusetts & Boston are about. — Charlie Baker (@MassGovernor) May 2, 2017
According to CBS Boston, Walsh said he hopes Red Sox fans will step up when the two teams face-off again Tuesday night at Fenway and give Jones a standing ovation when he steps on the field.
“This is unacceptable and not who we are as a city,” Walsh said in a statement to Boston.com. “These words and actions have no place in Fenway, Boston, or anywhere. We are better than this.”
Samir Handanovic saved a penalty and Nemanja Vidic was sent off as Torino held Inter to a 0-0 draw.
Both sides won in the Europa League play-offs on Thursday, so confidence was brimming at the Stadio Olimpico. Daniel Osvaldo had a slight groin strain and Rodrigo Palacio was injured, so Mateo Kovacic started behind Mauro Icardi, while Gary Medel and Yann M'Vila received their Serie A debuts. Toro missed Paulo Vitor Barreto, Alexander Farnerud, Perez and the suspended Giuseppe Vives, but above all Alessio Cerci was nowhere to be seen ahead of his transfer to Atletico Madrid.
Nemanja Vidic made his Serie A debut and was adjudged to have brought down Fabio Quagliarella after 19 minutes. Marcelo Larrondo took the spot-kick duties, but Samir Handanovic confirmed his extraordinary record by saving the penalty.
Quagliarella and Hernanes had headers off target, while just before the break Andrea Ranocchia failed to make the most of a Jonathan cross.
Icardi's first touch let him down on a counter-attack when sent clear by Hernanes, but Toro started the second half in a much more determined manner. Larrondo knocked down a Matteo Darmian cross for Quagliarella to volley inches wide with Handanovic beaten.
Daniele Padelli was decisive with a wonderful reaction save to flap away Daniel Osvaldo's attempt from point-blank range, then Alessandro Gazzi rushed in to block Medel's follow-up.
Padelli was again at full stretch on a Hernanes curler towards the far bottom corner, as Inter were far more dangerous once Osvaldo came off the bench.
Bad news for Toro, who saw Nikola Maksimovic stretchered off with a left knee injury. Juan Jesus stood tall to stop Larrondo getting his head to a Cristian Molinaro cross.
Inter had penalty appeals for a Kamil Glik shirt-tug on Icardi, but this time the referee waved play on. Vidic sarcastically applauded the referee moments later and the official reacted with a red card.
Scientists are warning that conditions are perfect for a bumper crop of algae to grow in Lake Erie this summer.
They say heavy April showers are washing fertilizer off farm fields into the water in larger amounts, and those chemicals feed algae blooms that starve the lake of oxygen. Feeding on phosphorus, algae produces bad smells and toxins that are absorbed by underwater life, choking it off.
"There's a 99 per cent chance, there's a strong chance, that [we will] have very bad algae this year," said Raj Bejankiwar, a scientist with the International Joint Commission.
The warning comes two years after Lake Erie experienced the worst algae blooms on record.
By the numbers Approximately 40 million people live around the Great Lakes.
About 73 million tourists visited the Great Lakes in Ontario in 2010.
About $12.3 billion was injected into the economy by those tourists. Source: IJC
Blooms are traditionally confined to the summer months, mainly August. Last year, however, warmer temperatures in March allowed algae to grow earlier in the year, but the bloom wasn't as big as the one witnessed in 2011.
This year, April rain could cause as big a bloom as the one from two years ago. Heavy spring rain was to partially blame for that one, too.
Phosphorus gets from the fields to the lakes in one of three ways:
Blown there by the wind.
Soaking through the soil, entering the ground water and flowing into rivers and lakes.
Rain washes it off the top of the soil and directly into rivers and lakes.
Bejankiwar is the lead on the Lake Erie Ecosystem Priority, a branch of the IJC that is studying algae levels in Lake Erie. He said it's normal to have some algae in the lake, but not massive blooms.
Bejankiwar said extra nutrients that feed algae also come from sewage treatment plants, recreational properties and golf courses. He said most of the phosphorus comes from farm run-off.
It's not much phosphorus per farm or per hectare, but it adds up, says one professor.
"If we're talking about the amount a farmer would lose, we're talking less than a few grams per hectare," said Ivan O'Halloran, a professor at Ridgetown College.
O'Halloran said that one kg of phosphorus run-off can have a "significant impact" on algae levels.
'No fertilizer police'
He said one way farmers try to decrease the amount of phosphorus that ends up in the lakes is to make sure they only put what they need into the soil. Soil tests can be done to see how much fertilizer is necessary.
However, there are no "fertilizer police," and best management practices are not laws: they are suggestions, O'Halloran said. That all makes it hard to regulate the distribution of fertilizer.
Henry Denotter, a Kingsville farmer, plants ground cover in the fall to keep the fertilizer from washing into the ditch. After the wheat is harvested, Denotter plants beets and clover in his wheat field to keep the soil in place. Even then, some phosphorus always escapes, he said.
"We do whatever we can to try and retain it, but we have to stay in business, too," Denotter said.
Denotter said it's impossible to keep all the fertilizer in the soil and dire predictions from scientists won't change that.
He thinks scientists should recognize there is only so many farmers can do.
Denotter already uses GPS to determine where he needs to fertilize; uses soil tests to determine how much fertilizer he needs; and uses what he calls a "no-till" system, where he doesn't turn up the earth.
Denotter said it's in farmers' best interest to do what they can to keep the phosphorus in the soil because it costs about $700 per tonne.
Last fall, the Essex Region Conservation Authority and Windsor-Essex County Environment Committee launched an educational campaign about blue-green algae. It's called Overload: Lake Erie Blue Green Algae.
Joining the stench of lead filling the air of the battlegrounds, puffs of dust are also wafting through Mosul's streets. This time, it was not the result of air raids by the Islamic State's (IS) bombing of a mosque, shrine or other building. The dust came in fact from road-paving and cleaning and lighting projects, among others. The city has not witnessed such works since 2003, and many are asking why they're happening now.
When asked about services 10 months into IS rule, 15 people living in different areas of the city told Al-Monitor that Mosul has become cleaner than it was under the Iraqi government's control, and its services have been improving. Residents outside Mosul were surprised.
What kind of change in services took place in Mosul, though?
IS quickly got involved in all departments, including the Municipality Directorate, where its influence started before the fall of Mosul in June 2014. IS succeeded in deploying its members in all departments and institutions to blackmail the managers and employees in Iraq.
The first step consisted of moving the equipment left behind by Iraqi forces, who were fighting IS in June 2014 and withdrew from Mosul, especially the concrete blocks. The services departments acted under IS orders to, as it later turned out, dig deep trenches and used these blocks to build a wall around the city of Mosul.
As soon as IS established a managerial structure for its state in Ninevah, the “services office” rose as one of its most active branches and started to provide the main services to Mosul residents.
The fear factor played an important role in pushing employees to work hard, and it was then that the citizens noticed the improvements. Civil activist and head of the Liberation Organization Abdul Aziz al-Jarba told Al-Monitor, “Street cracks were fixed and roads were cleaned and trees were planted on the sides of the roads.”
Jarba noted that IS realized early on the value in controlling a city like Mosul, which accommodates 2 million people and has important economic resources. IS threatened employees with flogging if they did not obey its orders.
The services office focused on markets and worked to establish several in the city center, moving the stores that did not comply with IS rules and requirements, such as not extending onto the main streets and sidewalks, there. Al-Madina Souq was one of these, established upon the ruins of the oldest police station in Mosul. IS imposed annual taxes reaching up to $1,500 paid by grocers in the covered market.
IS overcame a major challenge in providing oil derivatives, such as fuel, from the oil fields in Iraq and Syria under its control. The group also brought its experience in incineration — acquired in primitive recycling factories — from Syria to Mosul, and it has been producing oil in Mosul since July 2014. Despite its mediocre quality, this oil is relatively widely available.
IS treaded carefully when it came to the Internet and communications. At the end of November 2014, IS disabled telecommunication towers in Mosul. As a result, all mobile networks became almost completely dysfunctional, and they remain so. The Iraqi government reportedly decided to suspend Internet service in the city to prevent IS from using it to spread its messages. In response, IS allowed Internet service providers to resume their operations through satellite networks outside the control of Iraq's National Communications and Media Commission.
Officials in the Ninevah government are watching from afar. Ali al-Zoubai, a member of Ninevah's governorate council who lives in Erbil, told Al-Monitor that citizens in Mosul informed him over the phone that services in the city have indeed improved. He added that IS is trying to gain legitimacy and popular support by providing services that elected governments failed to provide in the past. According to Zoubai, this is one of the most dangerous IS tactics yet.
The services office accorded attention to the entertainment sector, as well. On May 1, it reopened the Ninevah Oberoi Hotel, one of the most important hotels in Mosul, and changed its name to Al-Warithin Hotel. The group also removed the murals it deemed forbidden and sinful and invited Mosul families to a ceremonial lunch. The services office announced that it would give newlyweds free accommodation for three nights in the hotel, meals included.
IS went so far as to open the presidential palace built by Saddam Hussein for citizens to visit, contemplate the refined building and sit in the beautiful gardens. This is exactly what US forces did when they invaded Mosul in April 2003.
Each step that IS takes is preceded and accompanied by a large-scale media campaign primarily targeting the citizens. The slogan repeated most often is “Mosul Flourishes under the Caliphate,” according to Iraqi journalist Sarmad Ahmad, who lives in Baghdad. He gave a pseudonym to protect his family still in Mosul.
Ahmad explained IS' behavior as an attempt to delude everyone into thinking that the organization will stick around for a long time, to win more support and followers and to boost the morale of its own members as well.
IS mostly boasts about the return of electricity to Mosul after the city had suffered from a power cut that lasted seven months. The organization managed to convince people that this happened following an alleged deal with Iraqi Kurdistan, without providing any details.
Ninevah Gov. Atheel al-Nujaifi wrote on his Facebook page March 17, “200 megawatts have arrived today, and the provision of electricity will increase in the coming days, in proportion to the amount of water reaching the Mosul dam and the possibility of releasing it.”
IS is regaining ground in Mosul in an unprecedented way and increasing its popularity, especially among civilians. It is worth noting, though, that the services are offered by the services department employees, who still receive their salaries from the Baghdad government. IS is working to prove to Mosul's citizens that it is an organized entity capable of ensuring security and providing services — a goal the previous Iraqi governments and security forces failed to achieve over the last 11 years.
IS' efforts to rehabilitate the services sector in Mosul will further complicate the mission of the Iraqi forces and the international coalition against IS, if they decide to conduct military operations to regain control of Mosul.
10 School Teacher Resumes Writing Tips to Ensure You Show Your Value
School teacher resume writing tips to help you land teaching job interviews and ultimately job offers. The resume you include in your job application represents you in your absence. Don't underestimate the importance of writing a resume to target the new position you have your heart set on.
Ensure the resume you submit for the school teaching job you wish to secure communicates your top teaching skills along with success stories to prove you have those core competencies.
Let's get started.
Resume Tips for School Teachers to Elevate Job Offers
1. Make sure your resume for a school teacher makes YOU stand out.
Even though it may seem like you are selling your resume and cover letter first, you are selling yourself first and foremost. Your resume must look and sound appealing; you need to make sure that you come across as a desirable candidate.
While concentrating on developing an attractive design, ensure that you include all pertinent information, for instance, education, credentials, work experience, professional development, etc. Assess the school district's job advertisement, if available, and make sure that you have touched on all required qualifications in your cover letter.
2. Highlight the job position you are applying for or field of interest.
Immediately following your contact information should be the job title you are targeting . Make it bigger than the rest of your text; treat it as you would a heading – bigger and bolder. For example, you may write Teacher Assistant, Teacher Aide, Science Teacher, High School Teacher , Elementary Principal, Professional Educator, Adjunct Business Instructor. By doing so, you immediately draw focus to the position in question and leave the hiring manager with a clear idea of which position is of most interest. Tailor this to each job posting, if needed.
3. Implement an area of expertise or core competencies section.
This area of knowledge section is crucial and if written correctly will set you apart from the competition. Focus on relevant and essential teaching skills needed to succeed in the job you are applying for and, of course, excelled at using.
Concentrate mostly on hard or technical skills, i.e. competencies required for job performance. These skills could include classroom management, student motivation, parental communications, differentiated instruction, reading strategies, digital skills, etc.
Examine soft skills such as problem-solving, organization, time management, relationship management, and self-reflection. List your qualities in a chart or bullet point format to make them stand out from the rest of your text.
4. Craft a well-written body that explores your work experience.
Use headings for Professional Experience, Teaching History, Work Experience, Teaching Contributions, Relevant Experience, Business Experience, etc.
This section is where you will list the places you worked, as well as the location, dates employed, and your job title. Make sure those items are bolded or one font size higher to make them stand out and reflect on their significance.
After, you will lay out your job responsibilities in a concise and matter-of-fact manner. Usually, this would be organized in chronological order, from newest to oldest. The organization of your resume will depend on your background. If you are a career change or re-entering the education sector you may need to bring prior relevant experience up front and center.
5. Highlight accomplishments.
One of the top school teacher resume writing tips is to showcase your relevant achievements. Immediately following your job responsibilities think of a few key accomplishments that stand out in your mind that you can adequately articulate in your resume.
An example would include an increase in student grade point average, reduction in absenteeism, securing a grant, increasing the grade level of a few at-risk students, etc., depending on the position you are targeting.
Regardless of the achievement, make sure you explain how you accomplished it. List these in bullet point format to set them apart from the rest of your duties. Try to find at least a couple of achievements for each position.
6. List your greatest strengths that show your expertise relevant to the position.
Analyze the job advertisement, if available, and see how the specified requirements correlate with the strengths you have demonstrated in a previous position. Perhaps you excel at collaborating to assess a situation and devise an appropriate reaction or solution.
Maybe you are great at interacting with parents and working with them to meet students' unique needs. On the other hand, you may be proficient in differentiated instruction to ensure you reach all learners to optimize learning outcomes.
7. Keep your writing compelling and concise.
Succinct your writing for both of your job application documents. You do not want to drag on when explaining your job responsibilities. Keep everything brief and to the point.
If your experience is in the same industry for the job in which you are applying, then the hiring manager should already know what each job entails. The same goes for the introductory paragraph of your resume. One paragraph or half a dozen or so bullet points should be enough to capture you as a professional.
8. Include anything relevant and discover your transferable skills.
When writing your resume keep in mind anything you have done (paid work, volunteer experience, additional education) that pertains to your desired position. Transferable skills are a set of qualities you have developed in one job that directly correlate with or will help you perform the responsibilities of the targeted position.
If you are a career changer, assessing your transferable skills is crucial! Evaluate your communication, interpersonal, time management, and leadership skills and anything else you think may give you an advantage.
9. Sell yourself immediately.
Since most school districts have many resumes to sift through, they can't devote their time to reading every single one of them to the fullest extent. For this reason, it is paramount that you sell yourself right away, as in 10 – 12 seconds. When you feel like you are ready to submit your documents, take 15 seconds to scan them, and ask, “Would I hire myself?” If the answer is “no”, you need to make yourself stand out more.
10. Hire A+ Resumes for Teachers – of course, us. 🙂

There is a growing roster of innovative organizations populated by people who recognize that nuclear technology is still in its infancy. Terrestrial Energy is one of the most promising of this organization because of its combination of problem-solving technology, visionary leadership, and strong focus on meeting commercial needs.
Nearly all of the commercial nuclear power plants operating and under construction today use the basic design components of solid fuel arranged into a critical mass that can produce massive quantities of heat in a compact volume. The heat produced in that solid fuel is almost always moved by water, with the heat energy that has been transported from the fuel transformed into steam that turns a turbine generator.
During a relatively brief period of rapid manufacturing, a capable component production infrastructure was established with tooling, processes, quality assurance procedures, and skilled personnel. Regulators learned how to review water cooled reactor designs.
Nuclear engineering departments focused on solid-fueled, water-cooled reactor technology because they recognized there was an established market for graduates who were primed with the applicable knowledge. Even though that period of construction came to a virtual halt, operators have continued to invest in developing their skills in extracting the greatest possible value from the plants that were completed.
All that infrastructure results in a substantial inertia that has encouraged most developers of new nuclear technology to stay with the basic model of prior generations — with some evolutionary improvements based on many decades worth of documented lessons learned.
However, one of the lessons learned from using the conventional technology is that there are certain unavoidable cost and schedule limitations associated with the technological choice. Water does not want to remain in liquid form at the temperatures that are desirable in a steam power plant; the solution is to use high pressures to control the physical state of the water. High pressures mean thick-walled containers and piping; thick walls add to welding challenges, make it difficult to control forming processes and lead to lengthy production cycles due to the need to control rates of heating and cooling to add process inspection stages to ensure all quality standards are met.
There are organizations that have developed procedures, built the necessary tooling, and demonstrated that they can perform the difficult tasks well, but the best in the business have reached a stage where there are only marginal improvements available. When done by the best at a sufficient scale, water-cooled, solid-fueled nuclear power plants can compete against most fossil fuels, especially when they get credit for producing clean power that replaces fossil fuel power that inherently must discharge at least some of its waste materials into the environment.
Unfortunately, the marginal advantage is often not sufficient to overcome the risk that the nuclear plant will not be built by the very best and will suffer schedule interruptions that drive prices into the uncompetitive range.
Innovators like Terrestrial Energy believe there are fundamental choices that can alter the competitive balance. TEI's choice has been to design a reactor that is more akin to a chemical reactor, with fuel that is a dissolved reactant in a solution (in this case, a salt solution) where the solution provides the transport mechanism for the heat produced in a strongly exothermic reaction. Of course, the reaction in this case is not a chemical reaction; it is a fission chain reaction.
The hot reactor fluid is circulated through multiple redundant heat exchangers sealed into the same container as the reactor. Fluoride salt without any actinides circulates on the other side of the primary heat exchangers to transport the reactor heat to a second set of heat exchangers where water receives the heat and boils into high temperature, high pressure steam.
The salt circuits operate at high temperature but low pressure. Low pressure enables containers that are simpler, cheaper and quicker to produce compared to the containers performing similar functions in a water-cooled reactor.
The heat and pressure conditions in the steam generator are more similar to those in a fossil fuel boiler than those in a pressurized water steam generator.
Terrestrial Energy has chosen to operate its molten reactor on low enriched uranium — which it describes as a dry tinder — vice thorium, which is the frequently targeted molten salt reactor fuel. According to TEI's web page explaining that choice, thorium is analogous to “wet wood” and needs a “torch” like plutonium-239 or highly enriched uranium (either 235 or 233) in order to be lit and sustained.
TEI knows there is plenty of available natural uranium at an affordable cost, and that there is plenty of capability to produce the correct enrichment with the ability to expand capacity as needed. Uranium fuel has a well-established supply chain; using it will simplify licensing. TEI is aggressive about commercialization; it is aiming to simplify both designs and related processes in order to drive down schedule-related costs.
TEI understands that graphite is a well-proven and understood moderator and structural material for high temperature, liquid-fueled reactors, but TEI also understands graphite's characteristics of storing energy and changing dimensions under a sustained neutron flux. Replacing graphite components would be complicated; designing them to last the lifetime of the reactor would require research and development with uncertain results.
TEI has a solution for that issue in the form of producing sealed reactor/primary heat exchanger units with installed redundancy that will last for roughly seven years before needing to be replaced. Each unit will have a shielded space for two reactor modules, one will be in use and one will be cooling off. The design philosophy is similar to that used in staged rockets; the difference is that TEI will not throw away used reactors; they will contain useful materials that can be recycled when conditions are right for that activity to begin.
TEI has developed conceptual designs for three different power outputs aimed at various niches in the power market, ranging from 29 MWe to 290 MWe. Any of the basic power modules can be combined at a power station to provide a large total output power level.
One of the more important commercial decisions that TEI has made is to put its headquarters in Canada and to plan to use the Canadian performance-based licensing process. That process should take several years less than the one that would be required for a US license. Once there are operating units in Canada, presumably it will be easier to show US regulators how their system works.
Terrestrial Energy has a lot of work to do to achieve their goal of producing power by the early part of the 2020s, but the principals have established a plan that has strong potential for success.

Gettysburg, above in August 2012, was among the parks and monuments closed… (Catharine Hamm / Los Angeles…)
Federal employees have been furloughed, federal assistance for those needing food has been threatened and tourists everywhere have been shut out of monuments and national parks as a result of the partial shutdown of the U.S. government.
But the Washington budget standoff that triggered the shutdown has had an unexpected effect: Cancellation of a proposed KKK demonstration at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania.
The Confederate White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan had received a special use permit to hold a demonstration at the Gettysburg National Military Park on Saturday. But the permit has been rescinded because of the federal government shutdown, which has closed monuments and parks across the nation, according to a park news release.
Permits for at least 11 events in October have been rescinded, Katie Lawhon, management assistant at Gettysburg National Military Park, told the Patriot-News of Pennsylvania.
the new M.A.S.K. comic series a few weeks ago, IDW posted a cryptic image stating "M.A.S.K. is only the beginning...the Revolution is coming!" Today thanks to an exclusive EW article, we get our first look at the new Revolution comic series! Shortly after revealing plans fora few weeks ago, IDW postedstating "M.A.S.K. is only the beginning...the Revolution is coming!" Today thanks to an exclusivearticle, we get our first look at the newcomic series!
Coming September 2016, Revolution will be a 5-issue biweekly event series featuring characters from several Hasbro properties like Transformers, G.I. Joe, M.A.S.K., Micronauts, ROM, and Action Man. IDW Editor-in-chief Chris Ryall calls this shared universe a new status quo and not a reboot:
“We didn't want this to be what fans have seen from so many others, which is a reboot or a relaunch where you're asked to forget about all these characters and stories you've been following for years. It's just now everybody will be acknowledging each other in a much greater way than ever before.”
IDW's Revolution from illustrator Fico Ossio and colored by Diego Rodriguez.
(Click to enlarge)
Ryall also reveals in his EW interview that the team-up will be necessary because of Ore 13, an unstable form of Energon which is the substance that gives the Transformers life.
"There's a version of that on earth, that has an adverse effect on tech, which adversely affects ROM, and changes the status of him and his villains, the Dire Wraiths. It affects the Micronauts universe in a way they didn't expect, and then it also gives birth to M.A.S.K., which is a big new title we're launching out of this."
For us M.A.S.K. fans, this Revolution event seems to be the origin story for the organization itself that will lead into the new series in November 2016. Writer Brandon Easton (which actually shared this announcement with us!) will be "handling the M.A.S.K. side of Revolution" and give us the origin of the M.A.S.K. team members in the subsequent series. In the new image, you can clearly see Thunder Hawk with a slightly-modernized look as well as more classic versions of Switchblade and Rhino.
Revolution will tie into Hasbro's previously-announced Cinematic Universe. The Visionaries have yet to surface so will they be passed over or replaced with Action Man? Will the new Transformers: The Last Knight includes any references to these new comics? More will hopefully be revealed!

Image copyright AP Image caption Passengers at Orly airport in Paris were being affected by transport strikes on Thursday
Threats of French air traffic disruption this weekend have been lifted, ministers say, although a rail strike is still halving services.
Four of five unions have called off air traffic control action, with Transport Minister Alain Vidalies assuring there would be no disruption.
Fears of the strike spreading to the Paris metro have not materialised.
Trade unions are protesting against work time changes but the strike comes amid general labour unrest.
The main focus is a labour reform bill that gives companies more leeway to hire and fire workers, reduce pay or extend working hours.
The unrest and travel disruption is of particular concern given that France is hosting the Euro 2016 football championship, which begins later this month. Some 2.5 million people, 1.5 million of them foreigners, are expected to attend dozens of matches nationwide.
Mr Vidalies said on Thursday that four of the five unions who had given notice of an air traffic control strike from 3 to 5 June had called it off.
He also said that traffic was normal on the Paris metro, as well as on buses and trams in the capital.
Image copyright AP Image caption The Paris metro was running normally, ministers said
The fifth union, the militant CGT, still has a hold over the state-run SNCF rail services, where only about a third of inter-city links and 60% of high-speed TGVs are running.
The strike action began on Tuesday evening.
The CGT also continues to disrupt oil refineries, docks and nuclear power plants.
There was also some airport disruption on Thursday, particularly at Orly and Lille, with Air France cancelling 10% of flights.
French labour reform bill - main points
The 35-hour week remains in place, but as an average. Firms can negotiate with local trade unions on more or fewer hours from week to week, up to a maximum of 46 hours.
Firms are given greater freedom to reduce pay.
The law eases conditions for laying off workers, which is strongly regulated in France. It is hoped companies will take on more people if they know they can shed jobs in case of a downturn.
Employers to get more leeway to negotiate holidays and special leave, such as maternity or for getting married. These are currently also heavily regulated.
Labour Minister Myriam el-Khomri urged the CGT "to show some form of economic patriotism. Just when the economy is picking up, we shouldn't weaken it".
But CGT head Philippe Martinez again accused the government of refusing to talk.
New protests against the labour law were planned on Thursday in Nantes, Rennes, Toulouse, Marseille and Paris.
However, one opinion poll in Le Figaro suggested public support for the strike may now be waning, with 60% saying the CGT was abusing its position.
The labour reform bill comes before the Senate this month, having passed through the lower house without a vote.
The next national day of action by trade unionists is due on 14 June.
France's Socialist President Francois Hollande insists the bill will not be withdrawn despite months of unrest which erupted into street clashes between protesters and police at marches last Thursday.

Kendrick Lamar was the big winner at the Grammy Awards this year in Los Angeles.
He won best rap album, rap performance, rap/sung collaboration, rap song and music video for Bad Blood with Taylor Swift.
Taking home five gramophones was just one great in a fantastic year for Kendrick Lamar.
That year includes a nod from President Obama who said his album To Pimp a Butterfly was "outstanding".
So the president of the United States believed Kendrick had the best album last year but the Grammys felt that accolade belonged to Taylor Swift.
This is why 2015 was Kendrick's year
He performed for free on the back of a lorry driving through Los Angeles.
And only gave fans one-hour notice.
But they came out in their thousands.
He released an album eight days earlier than advertised.
Take note Frank Ocean.
It was because it was accidently put on iTunes before it should have been.
And even Taylor Swift wanted him to be part of her squad.
He then featured in her video for Bad Blood.
Kendrick went against the message of most record labels and rap artists, releasing what real people wanted to hear.
"You know the songs that are out, we all love these songs. They sell a lot of singles and make these record labels a lot of money," he said.
But those "really living" in the streets don't want those singles, he added.
"They want to get away from that".
He also broke a Spotify record.
Kendrick took the crown from Drake who got 6.8m streams of If You're Reading This It's Too Late in a day.
He was awarded with a generational icon award from the California state senate.
It was for his willingness to give back to the community of Compton.
He said: "Being from the City of Compton and knowing the parks that I played at and the neighbourhoods, I always thought how great the opportunity would be to give back to my community off of what I do in music."
Oh and he has the first ever American number one album with the word pimp in the title.
Previous entrants were Pimp C's Pimpalation in 2006 which got to number three, as well as Dirty's Keep It Pimps & Gangsta which got to number 63 in 2003.

Most nursing home residents denied Medicare-funded psychological care, advocates say
Updated
Older Australians living in nursing homes have some of the highest rates of depression and anxiety, but most are excluded from Medicare-funded psychological treatment available to the wider community, aged care advocates say.
About one third of aged care residents have depression and anxiety — making them two to three times more likely to have the conditions than older people living in the general community, according to studies by the National Aging Research Institute.
Aged and Community Services Australia, which represents not-for-profit aged care providers, has released a statement saying it believes the Government has a responsibility to make mental health treatments and services readily accessible and available to all Australians — including those living in residential aged care.
COTA Australia chief executive Ian Yates called for an end to the inequity.
"Many older Australians end up entering residential aged care with mental illness because we tend to regard mental illness as an inevitable part of aging, which it isn't," Mr Yates said.
"And, every mental health plan that the Commonwealth and the states have had has put older people at the back of the bus."
Mr Yates said most nursing home residents have not had the benefit of seeing Medicare-funded psychologists.
"The fact that aged care residents are excluded from [Medicare-funded psychological care] is a historical anomaly," he said.
Australian Psychological Society executive director Professor Lyn Littlefield said it can lead to incorrect medical treatment.
"Often, they're not given the right medication because there's no formal assessment," Professor Littlefield said.
"So, you need a psychologist to assess them to work out what type of mental health problem they've got and often it's anxiety or depression, but very frequently it can be mixed in with dementia."
"If they were receiving that care, their life would have much higher quality.
"They'd be functioning at a much higher level. They'd be more connected and able to connect in with other people."
Professor Littlefield said evidence showed older people can benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy.
AM requested an interview with Acting Health Minister Arthur Sinodinos, but he was not available.

After a week of critical attacks on his anti-gun viral video, Jim Carrey is firing back at Fox News and other critics of his controversial video.
In a press statement this weekend, the comedic movie star took aim at how Fox News characterized his Funny or Die web video, "Cold Dead Hands."
In the statement, he refers to the news network as "Fux News."
"I have watched Fux News rant, rave, bare its fangs and viciously slander me because of my stand against large magazines and assault rifles," Carrey said.
"I would take them to task legally if I felt they were worth my time or that anyone with a brain in their head could actually fall for such irresponsible buffoonery."
Carrey goes on to write that Fox News is a media colostomy bag filled with fake journalists that should be emptied.
These vitriolic remarks are in response to the network's week of televised outrage over a video, which led to Fox News Host Greg Gutfield calling Carrey a "dirty, stinking coward."
"The most pathetic tool on the face of the Earth and I hope his career is dead and I hope he ends up sleeping in a car, the way his life began," said Gutfield about Carrey during his afternoon program, The Five.
According to Gutfield, to even discuss gun control in such cultural terms is to condescend to Southerners and Midwesterners.
He also accused Carrey of being a West Coast liberal elitist.
The video in question features Carrey satirizing deceased actor Charlton Heston.
Heston, who was president of the National Rifle Association for five years, gave a famous speech during the 2000 NRA Convention in which he proclaimed that the government could take his guns "from my cold dead hands."
In the Internet video set during a supposed taping of the TV show Hee-Haw, Carrey plays both a pro-guns Heston and a separate country music performer.
While Heston is promoting the legalization of all guns, Carrey's Marty Robbins inspired musician sings a ballad that insinuates Heston and the NRA's positions are unholy.
"Imagine if the Lord were here and He knew what you'd been thinking," Carrey says in the song. "And on the ones who sell the guns, He'd sick the vultures and coyotes. Only the devil's true devotees could profiteer from pain and fear."
Throughout the video Carrey suggests that Heston's soul may lay forever in the sand due to his desires for all guns, including assault weapons, to be legal.
We really started to hear a lot about bitcoin ATMs late last year, when Las Vegas-based Robocoin launched the first two-way ATM in a downtown Vancouver coffee shop (that device went on to process over $1 million CAD in transactions in one month).
Since then, to say that this industry has flourished is an understatement.
According to the Bitcoin ATM Map — a service that keeps track of bitcoin/cryptocurrency ATMs — there are now over 200 ATMs that cater to crypto enthusiasts in operation globally.
These ATMs are distributed across six continents from over 15 manufacturers.
Five manufacturers lead the race in distribution of their devices, which includes 14 Genesis1 units, 23 Skyhooks (these are the low-cost ATM solutions that debuted recently, selling for $999 per unit), 27 BitAccess units, 35 Robocoins, and a whopping 75 Lamassu devices.
North America comes in with the largest amount of bitcoin ATMs in operation. Meanwhile in Africa, one known unit from Lamassu is available in Johannesburg, South Africa.
And while the global network of bitcoin ATMs is already impressive, it only keeps growing. If that isn't a sign that bitcoin is here to stay, we don't know what is.
Finding an ATM near you
Using the aforementioned Bitcoin ATM Map at coinatmradar.com, you can search for your location and simply navigate around the map to find the ATM nearest to you (if you're lucky enough to have one in range, of course).
One of the neat features about this website is that detailed information on each of the ATMs are available, such as address, operating hours, direction (fiat to cryptocurrency and vice-versa), and even fees if applicable.
Overall, a highly-recommended resource.
Charlotte Bobcats Defeat Indiana Pacers In Season Opener: Is This A Sign Of Things To Come?
Charlotte Bobcats Defeat Indiana Pacers In Season Opener: Is This A Sign Of Things To Come? by Chris Walder
We are just three games in to the 2012/13 NBA season and the number one story around the league isn't how dominant the newly revamped Los Angeles Lakers look, but when exactly they team plans on winning a game?
Go figure.
Chris Paul had a double-double of 18 points and 15 assists to help lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 105-95 victory over the Lakers Friday night.
Jamal Crawford led all Clippers with 21 points off the bench. Blake Griffin pitched in with 15 points and 8 rebounds of his own.
This loss is the Lakers third in four days. Including the preseason, the team has lost 13 straight. They haven't won a game since May 18th.
Los Angeles hasn't started 0-3 to begin a season since 1978. It's just the fourth time in franchise history that this has occurred.
Kobe Bryant had an outstanding offensive showing, finishing with 40 points on just 23 shots, as well as 6 rebounds. His 2 steals pushed him past Magic Johnson on the all-time Lakers list, giving him 1725 for his career.
Despite his impressive stat line, it still wasn't enough to lift the Lakers past their Los Angeles rivals. Even an appearance from “The Black Mamba” didn't get the job done.
Dwight Howard, who battled foul trouble throughout the night, finished with 13 points, 8 rebounds and 5 blocks. He never got into a rhythm offensively because of his fouls. Steve Nash was inactive for the Lakers as he was nursing a shin injury he suffered a few nights earlier in Portland. His replacement Steve Blake gave a noble effort trying to slow down Chris Paul (arguably the best point guard in basketball), but he was clearly overwhelmed and overmatched with his assignment.
So what's the excuse this time? Bryant was an offensive machine and the team as a whole shot 50% from the field. So what went wrong?
Well, it certainly doesn't help when you turn the ball over 20 times, 10 of those coming from Howard and Bryant alone. The bench wasn't of any assistance as well, scoring just 16 points compared to the Clippers second-unit which scored 46. In fact, Jamal Crawford outscored the Lakers reserves by himself (21-17).
Laker fans around the nation are already calling for coach Mike Browns firing. On a team with such star power, 0-3 (2 losses coming against far lesser opponents) is simply unacceptable.
His infamous “Princeton offense” has been under constant ridicule and judgement ever since he implemented it into the system.
[blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/RealSkipBayless/status/263734172932263936″]
In a nutshell, the offense consists of a lot of passing, back-door cuts and picks on and off the ball. It basically negates all positions on the court outside of the center.
With 2x MVP Steve Nash on the roster, it would seem that the sure thing would be to have the ball in his hands, allow him to control the offense and then place your bets on him. The Princeton offense takes the ball out of his hands, which is something fans are none to pleased about.
“Sir Charles” Barkley summed up the offense the best way he could.
[blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/mattmosley/status/263513404847816704″]
I'm not one to say a head coach should change his philosophy just 3 games into a new season, but it looks to me and a majority of Lakers and basketball fans in general that this particular offense isn't cutting it. Many were skeptical years ago when the “Triangle offense” was first put into use, and that obviously ended up being perfect for that roster.
This time, I can't seem to hold that same faith.
With Howard and Nash on board, Mike Brown needs to utilize their strengths rather than putting them into awkward positions on the offensive end. It's not working. We all see that.
0-3 is no joke. 0-13 (even if they were just preseason games) is just awful for a team of this caliber.
Should Mike Brown be fired in the near future if this team doesn't shape up?
Absolutely. You can't fire players. The expectations around this team are so sky-high that anything short of a 60-win season and a Finals appearance will be considered a failure.
The Lakers next game is Sunday at home when they host the 0-2 Detroit Pistons. If Los Angeles loses and goes to 0-4, heads are going to roll big time, I promise you that.

Imagine losing one of your friends after they reportedly drowned while trying to rescue their girlfriend from the same fate. Being accused of ritually sacrificing them for the sake of acquiring magical powers would make you feel even worse about the entire tragedy, wouldn't it?
Unfortunately, Ghanaian soccer player Asamoah Gyan is currently facing this problem after the death of his friend Castro the Destroyer, a Ghanaian rapper who died in a suspected drowning accident while taking a jet-ski out with his girlfriend. At the time, the two were vacationing with Gyan at a Ghanaian resort.
However, the story didn't end there. Rumors began to circulate that Castro hadn't drowned, but that he had been ritually sacrificed by Gyan. Eventually, the public curiosity became so great that, in response to these rumors, a journalist named Daniel Kenu asked Gyan for his thoughts on the allegations at a recent press conference. Furious about the accusation, Gyan had to be restrained from physically confronting Kenu. However, just a couple days later, Gyan's brother and a group of his friends took down Kenu themselves, severely beating the journalist, almost to the point of death.
Since the beating, the rumors surrounding Gyan have only intensified. As a result, the star soccer player will hold a press conference refuting these allegations. Today, a statement released on Gyan's website provided full details about the presser:
POST CONTINUES BELOW
The Gyan Family will hold a press conference on Wednesday address recent issues of public interest including the disappearance of musical icon Theophilus Tagoe (aka Castro). The press conference which will take place at the Alisa Hotel will be addressed by counsel for the family Kissi Agyabeng. It will be recalled that Theophilus Tagoe (aka Castro) and Janet Bandu went missing while on a holiday hangout with Family and Friends of the Gyan's at a resort in Ada back in July. Relentless efforts are still being made to find the missing duo. The press conference will therefore seek to update the public through the media on the status of investigations so far. The opportunity will also be used to officially respond to some allegations and untruths bundled about in the media over the role of Asamoah Gyan in the duo's disappearance. The press meeting will also touch on the recent court case instigated by the Ashanti Regional editor of Graphic Communications Group Daniel Kenu against Baffour Gyan and Samuel Anim Addo. There will also be an opportunity for the press to ask related questions in a Q&A session during the press meeting. All media houses are therefore invited to attend this press conference which will begin at 1pm (local time) at the Alisa Hotel in Accra on Wednesday, September 24, 2014.
While we heavily, heavily doubt the legitimacy of these allegations and find them insensitive to Gyan's pain, it's hard not to be amazed by this story. What's the American equivalent of a saga like this one? Metta World Peace getting accused of practicing voodoo? Hey, it worked for Pedro Cerrano.

Updating Current Standings, Talking Underachievers (and see where each team will finish)
49 games left in the 108 game season
Now that every team has rounded the corner and is into the home stretch, I figured we would evaluate the conference landscape again. And maybe alter the predictions a bit since we have more information about each team. Following are the current Big Ten standings, along with the deviation each team has made from the results I predicted at the beginning of the season.
The deviation isn't calculated by total wins and losses compared to the final standings, but by wins and losses accrued compared to their expected total at this point of the season. For example, the Iowa Hawkeyes have performed right in line with their expected results through their first 10 games (win% = 60%), not with their expected results through all 18 (66.7%).
As you can see, most of the teams want to be .500, as seven teams are separated by two wins!
For comparison, here were the starting predictions from the beginning of the season (click to embiggen n such).
The overachievers so far this season fall into two categories. The Michigan Wolverines are the lone “surprise” team to qualify as a conference contender, while the second category of “surprises” dragged any potential Big Ten bubble teams into NIT oblivion. This bottom of the barrel category includes the Northwestern Wildcats and the Nebraska Cornhuskers, who currently combine to be 6 games better than their expected records.
The underachievers are teams that had stellar tournament resumes in the non-conference portion of their schedules, yet couldn't produce amidst the tight, suffocating Big Ten defenses – as Minnesota and Illinois are currently a combined 7 games below their expected records. By struggling mightily out of the gate, each team blew their shot at a reasonable seed on the bubble and made their NIT championship aspirations clear.
For some reason, these two seemingly-perennially talented teams can't put together a cohesive, mistake-free basketball team. Only essentially winning out or winning the Big Ten tournament would get these teams in the field. (Indiana would normally fall into this category as well, but concerns about their returning talent made this drop-off more foreseeable.) The common thread connecting these struggling teams are their new head coaches. The Illinois Fighting Illini are led for the second year by head coach and former Michigan-killer, John Groce. You may remember him from such times as Michigan's 2012 loss to Ohio in the round of 64. Richard Pitino, son of Michigan-killer Rick Pitino, is the Minnesota Golden Gopher's man at the helm for the first year. His only prior head coaching experience is an 18-14 campaign for Florida International (maybe we should figure out the correlation between years head coaching at a school and the success of that school in the Big Ten). I will talk more about these teams in a moment, after the expected final standings.
For clarity, the deviations from the expected results of each game so far leads to the following expected final standings. The predictions of each game that give these final standings have not changed from the beginning of the year due to observation bias of each team. I resisted the urge to come up with an alternate set of predictions to penalize struggling teams like Illinois and reward teams like Northwestern because I believe they will revert back to the mean somewhat over the rest of the season. That means we get funky results like…. The Wisconsin Badgers continue to lose and Michigan doesn't fall ball to Earth from the Blazing-Ball-Of-Winning it is currently riding. Which, maybe it will happen? But maybe not. Anyway, I'm sticking with it and here are the adjusted final standings to be expected.
Underachievers
Thus far, a couple teams have underperformed expectations, but not severely (the Wisconsin Badgers and the Ohio State Buckeyes). They can make their way back into the championship race. Other teams have imploded in the worst way possible, leaving no hope for the rest of the season (Minnesota and Illinois).
While Minnesota hasn't brought in a Rivals 4-star recruit since Rodney Williams in 2009, every coach has to understand the necessity of high-level talent to compete for a championship – so there can be no sympathy for Richard Pitino there. The obvious star-ranking disclaimer applies here: Trey Burke was rated lower than 140 other players in his class. Star-rankings are not infallible; they are just very, very, predictive.. So the lack of 4-star recruits isn't alarming by itself.
However, Minnesota's offense has been so lackluster that the talent-void is a problem. They play at one of the slowest paces in the country, which allows them to miraculously lose games consecutively at Nebraska, to Northwestern, and at Purdue, while winning others at home against Ohio State and Wisconsin. By itself, a team that plays at a slow tempo is not bad. Positively, it can suggest that a team forces its defenders to work for the whole shot clock on a long, brutal, well-orchestrated possession. However, with Minnesota's 165th nationally ranked field goal percentage, it suggests Minnesota struggles to get open look chances for drivers and shooters. Likewise, in the Big Ten, they commit the 9th most turnovers and 10th most fouls, a product of an undisciplined team.
On the other hand, Illinois has NO excuse for their less than inspiring performances in Big Ten play so far. They have a balance of talented players in each class and a pair of senior leaders in guard Joseph Bertrand and three-point shooting forward Jon Ekey. Their problems run so numerous it isn't conducive to count them all here. The most alarming statistic is their inability to create assists for each other, ranking dead last in the conference and 330th in the country in total assists. They simultaneously can't make three-pointers, ranking 275th in three-point field-goal percentage on offense, while allowing their opponents to make them at a 34.5% clip, good for 193rd in the country. It's an ugly combination.
Home Stretch
Amongst all the contenders, Michigan has the least favorable closing schedule. In fact, only Illinois and the Purdue Boilermakers have a tougher remaining schedule in the whole conference. This makes the Michigan's final expected record incredibly tough to attain.
For comparison's sake, Ohio State essentially has the advantage of playing the #62 team in the country eight times instead of playing the #42 team in the country eight times. That is the difference between St. Bonaventure/Colorado/Stephen F. Austin (#61,#62,#63) and Kansas State/St. John's/Xavier (#41,#42,#43). What slate looks easier?
In breaking down the final stretch of games for the two frontrunners, Michigan and Michigan State, the Michigan State Spartans have the clear advantage. While no games in the Big Ten season are considered “gimmes,” MSU has a few games that would qualify as the equivalent of a four-foot tap-in putt, as their home slate eases up considerably. Following is the schedule for each team's final home and away games, ordered from top to bottom by toughness.
Michigan State has three home games left against lower-tier teams where they should hold home-court easily, whereas Michigan only has two. On the road however, the Spartans have a tough slate filled with dangerous teams, including their return leg to Ann Arbor.
In order to not lose ground, both teams will need to win on the road against Purdue. A similar situation occurs as they both have to play in Columbus against Ohio State. OSU will be anxious to make up ground in the conference race against Michigan and may be fighting for a piece of the conference title against MSU on the last day of the season. Besides the rematch in Ann Arbor between UM and MSU, the away games against OSU will be either Michigan team's best chance to take an inherent advantage in the race and register a W instead of an L.
Finally, common games in opposite barns (home/away) against Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois will be the coin flip to decide who deserves the title.
Whereas….
Michigan has Wisconsin at home and Iowa and Illinois on the road
Michigan State has Wisconsin on the road and Iowa and Illinois at home.
(Substituting Indiana for Northwestern at home looks like a disadvantage, but it isn't – Northwestern has actually done better on the road in conference!)
That makes three toss-ups for Michigan and only two for MSU (playing Illinois at home no longer counts as a tough game). Unfortunately, Michigan could stumble their way across the gate with five or six more losses if nothing goes well, whereas MSU can really only suffer a maximum of four more.
The only sure thing left about the season is that whoever wins the rematch between the two teams in Ann Arbor will have their nose just about crossing the finish line first.

Now that it's getting warm out, doesn't a nice cold smoothie sound so nice and appetizing? Probably not a PooPoo smoothie though, right?
Well, that's the name of Burger King China's latest cold drink, Kotaku reports. But don't let the name deceive you. Apparently, the PooPoo smoothie is quite delicious. Its Chinese name is something that roughly translates to “mango ice smoothie with blow up pearls cold beverage” which is a much more accurate description than “PooPoo.”

According to Kotaku:
The PooPoo* Smoothie is pretty much like a Taiwanese Boba Tea. It's a mango flavored slushie with what tastes like lychee flavored “pulp pearls” on the bottom of the cup. It's topped off with a swirl of soft serve vanilla ice cream. I asked for chocolate but the staff didn't get the joke.
That sounds delightful, doesn't it? But like, naming it the PooPoo smoothie will clearly affect sales in a very negative way. Maybe Burger King's marketing team should have thought this one through a bit further.

President Donald Trump expressed “great confidence” in Saudi leaders on Monday amid an ongoing anti-corruption push, writing in a tweet, “They know exactly what they are doing.” In a two-part Twitter message sent from Tokyo, Trump said he has great confidence in King Salman and the crown prince, adding some of the arrested people “have been ‘milking' their country for years!”
Advertising
The Trump administration had been quiet about the unprecedented arrests of dozens of Saudi Arabia's most powerful princes, military leaders and ministers, which are widely being seen as a consolidation of power by the nation's 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The crackdown began Saturday with little warning.
Among those taken into custody were Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world's richest men, and two of the late King Abdullah's sons. The Saudi government has described the action as a sweeping effort to combat corruption. Mohammad Bin Salman, who has been working to implement reforms in the oil-rich state, has developed a close relationship with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.
BREAKING: Dean wants closure by July 1
A potential game-changer from CBS News and "The Early Show." Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean says he wants superdelegates to make a decision by JULY 1 -- the most specific he has been in his effort to prod the party to decide between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton before the Democratic National Convention in late August.
Harry Smith asked if after the nominating contests end with the South Dakota and Montana primaries on June 3, "Do you want the superdelegates to have some sort of vote immediately so that you'll know months in advance of the convention what the outcome is?”
Dean replied: “Well, I think the superdelegates have already been weighing in. I think that there's 800 of them and 450 of them have already said who they're for. I'd like the other 350 to say who they're at some point between now and the first of July so we don't have to take this into the convention.”
An aide explains that July 1 is not a drop-dead deadline: "The point is before the convention, ideally in June."
Dean has been criticized for not taking a heavier hand in ending the bruising contest.
The aide elaborates on the chairman's thinking: "Dean is personally engaged in this process, he's had numerous conversations with over 60 leaders inside and outside of the Democratic Party, to hear their thoughts, get their input and encourage them to help reinforce the importance of keeping the party united behind our nominee in November. ... He does not want to discuss those conversations publicly because in Washington, you can work behind the scenes and not worry about getting credit and actually get something done -- or you can talk about it in the press and not get anything done. But ... he wants to see this resolved before the convention and will encourage the superdelegates to make their choice known once the voters in the remaining states have had their say."
In an interview with AP's Nedra Pickler, Dean also made it clear he wants to get the show on the road. "There'll be some nasty fights if it goes to convention, and people will walk out," he told Nedra. "But I've also been talking to a fairly significant number of, by and large, nonaligned people about how we might resolve this." Nedra adds: "Dean wouldn't talk in detail about what the plan is, but it likely involves encouraging superdelegates to pick a candidate shortly after the voting ends."
So June 3-July 1 is your window, ladies and gents.
Full Harry Smith interview apres le jump.

CBS News, "The Early Show"
HARRY SMITH: “Joining us is Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Good morning, Dr. Dean.”
HOWARD DEAN: “Harry, thanks for having me on.”
HARRY SMITH: “There's a lot of ill will growing among Democrats. Polls show a significant number of supporters of both candidates, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, say that they will switch to John McCain if their candidate is not chosen. How are you going to put this back together again?”
DEAN: “Well, I think the candidates have got to understand that they have an obligation to our country to unify. Somebody's going to lose this race with 49.8 percent of the vote. And that person has got to pull their supporters in behind the nominee. That's our obligation, because in the end this is not about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. It's about our country. We're not going to have four more years of George W. Bush, which is essentially what McCain is offering us. There's a really big difference between our candidates on these issues. And I don't believe for a moment that at the end of the day, the Democrats are going to vote for somebody who's going to put more right-wingers on the Supreme Court. But we do need to keep in mind that personal attacks now, often do have the seeds of demoralization later on. So I want to make sure this campaign stays on the high ground.”
SMITH: “OK -- well, you're coming on morning television this morning to say this. Have you talked to both candidates or talked at least to their people?”
DEAN: “I have done both. I'm not going to say how those conversations went. I have good relationships with both candidates. and I think they would both be excellent presidents.”
SMIITH: “Have they pledged to tone down the rhetoric?”
DEAN: “Well, you know, I'm not going to get into who said what on the telephone calls. But I think that it's important that we understand this is not, again, about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. It's about a change for our country. it's about $3.50 gas prices, it's about staying in Iraq for 100 years, it's about a hands-off –”
SMITH: “Well, [the nominating] season is over. Do you want the superdelegates to have some sort of vote immediately so that you'll know months in advance of the convention what the outcome is?”
DEAN: “Well, I think the superdelegates have already been weighing in. I think that there's 800 of them and 450 of them have already said who they're for. I'd like the other 350 to say who they're at some point between now and the first of July so we don't have to take this into the convention.”
SMITH: “Dr. Dean, thank you so much for the time.”

Editor's Note:
We received an email from the author of this post, Arooj Ahmad, after it was published saying that he had been contacted by another author who accused him of including passages that Arooj did not originate. The other author, Nikhil Goyal, sent us a list of instances in which he said that Ahmad had used work that Goyal himself had written.
A review of the list shows that Arooj appears to have rewritten material that Goyal wrote about his own book (One Size Does Not Fit All) for Amazon.com, and that he failed to cite author Laurel Felt for a suggestion about how learning spaces should be redesigned. Arooj also linked the design of public education to the Industrial Revolution in the same way that Goyal did in his book, and that other authors have as well.
Arooj said in an email that he did not intentionally use anybody else's writings, and he noted that his approach to school reform is different from Goyal's.

Arooj Ahmad is a high-achieving 15-year-old high school sophomore at Libertyville High School in suburban Chicago who has taken a focused interest in reforming the U.S. education system, which he calls outdated.
He says that schools spend too much time forcing students to memorize a mountain of facts rather than teaching relevant knowledge that can help them select a career path and function well as adults.
In this post he explains what he thinks is wrong with school and how he would fix the system.
By Arooj Ahmad
The present education system in America is doing exactly what it is intended to do — generate compliant workers for the economy. It's somewhat efficient. It's organized. But it's outdated. Students are expected to memorize backward-looking knowledge to pass tests — and then they quickly forget what they learned because it has no relevance in their lives. And today it is not only students who are judged by standardized test scores but also their teachers, leading many to “teach to the test” rather than allow students to explore ideas and apply concepts to the real world. Formal academic education in America does not teach critical thinking. It kills creativity.
While learning how to memorize can sharpen the mind, it is only one small step in the cognitive process. Education should be an enlightening experience. Students should not feel like part of an assembly line. In fact, the current system was designed in the context of the Industrial Revolution, and surprising parallels of factory life can even be seen in today's schools: bells, rigid divisions of subject, and classification by age group. As children become teens, they begin to see fewer possibilities when they should be seeing more. Instead of developing necessary skills and natural talents concurrently, school conditions its subjects for only one possible future: college – a continuation of this traditional system in a somewhat more enlightening atmosphere.
We need change.
While America's public education system accepts students from every socioeconomic background, it does not address the different needs of students. For example, the learning environment of an inner-city school should include things that a suburban school does not need. First and foremost, students who are hungry need food and those who can't afford medical attention should have access to it at their schools. Qualified teachers must be put into appropriately sized classes with effective resources.
Learning should be messy! Divergent thinking can be taught. Teachers, administrators, policymakers, and even students will have to step out of their comfort zones to remove the standardized, short-term mentality about learning.
Right now, teachers are learning how to teach the Common Core State Standards in math and English, an initiative that has been adopted by most U.S. states. The standards are said to define “the knowledge and skills that students should have within their K–12 education careers.” These standards offer a necessary benchmark to ensure that all students are learning something, but, at the same time, they dictate the curricula of mathematics and English over the course of students' entire pre-college educational careers. There's rigidity built into that system.
Students shouldn't learn material just for the sake of passing the test. They should learn for the sake of learning. Students should enjoy going to school. The practical solution to accomplish this lies in two key improvements that must take hold in today's education system: relevant, holistic curricula and freedom of subject choice.
Here's how I see it. In levels K-8, the learning of essential academic subjects should be taught in the context of today's world. The knowledge has to be relevant. Mathematics, history, language arts, reading, writing, science, and other subjects should be exposed to students as topics for exploration and discovery. Project-based learning and collaboration should be emphasized. Inter-age cooperation, active learning, and mentorship must be encouraged. Teachers in different subjects should coordinate lessons so students can learn to see the world as a whole, not in subject parts. Learning environments should look less like factories and more like laboratories, meeting rooms, and coffee shops.
Methods of smart assessment can be used to gauge the progress of individual students as well as the entirety of classrooms. The efficient A-F grading system can still be utilized if the learning and evaluation of each classroom is unique. Instead of teacher evaluation based on raw numbers, rankers can look at annual student growth based on actual learning, classroom observations, and peer reviews.
A key element of middle school is initial exposure to career fields that students can choose to explore further in high school. Teachers can give students a broad understanding of career fields as it relates to the classes they are teaching. Students will be encouraged to self-direct their learning and develop a passion. This system is not anti-disciplinary; it's simply more flexible. If schools are doing their job, students will no longer be asking, “When am I ever going to use this?” and will instead ask, “How can I learn more?”
We know from observations and surveys that two out of every three high school seniors do not know exactly what course of education matches their interests, as they have not been exposed to career fields in their real-world applications. Under my model, students should be sufficiently exposed to the basic reality of the professional fields in the American work force by the time they enter high school.
High school freshmen who have developed a passion for a certain field should be able to take courses that almost exclusively apply to their passion. For example, students with an interest in business should be taking a lot of math and English courses. Students who have not yet developed a passion can take a range of courses, including those offered today, such as math, history, science, English, etc. But they can also take elective courses that help them establish or further develop their passion.A difference from today would be that the curricula of all courses would be rewritten to be relevant and useful to the students. Critical thinking should be encouraged in every class.
Testing shall be relevant, fair, and accurate depictions of actual learning. In high school, project-based learning and collaboration should be more prominent than it was in middle school. Enriching afterschool experiences such as sports and clubs should deliver expanded learning that stretches beyond academics. When these elements of school come together, a truly higher education will be achieved. Allowing students to explore what they want to do in life early in school would lessen the number of undecided college students constantly switching their majors.
Over the course of high school, students will be able to take a great leap towards their chosen field because they will be allowed the freedom of choice in their classes. The person interested in business will use four years in high school to learn what is necessary to apply himself/herself in that field by gaining specialized knowledge of the academic subjects as it applies to their field. We are likely to see fewer college students constantly switching their majors.
We must think differently about human capacity. The old habits of our institutions and their environments must be reformed. As Albert Einstein once said, “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”
Ahead of the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, we asked beer writers from across the country to offer lists of can't-miss breweries in each region showcased at the festival — and add a few wild cards they want to check out.
Our 2016 GABF previews start with a report on the New England region from Joshua M. Bernstein, a beer, spirits, food and travel writer who lives in New York. He is the author of “Brewed Awakening” and “The Complete Beer Course.” His newest book is Complete IPA: The Guide to Your Favorite Craft Beer,” the ultimate road map to the most popular craft beer style in America. The colorful book spotlights the best IPA makers and offers itineraries for great craft beer adventures.
Here are Bernstein's GABF 2016 picks:
Gun Hill Brewing Co. (The Bronx, New York): For years I've run a homebrew tour in NYC, taking drinkers into the apartments of the city's most promising brewers. Chris Prout always stood out, making Belgian-style sours and honey-smoothed IPAs. After a stint at Greenpoint Beer & Ale, he's now running the Bronx's Gun Hill, making crushable IPAs like Roll Call, a Berliner weisse crammed with coffee beans (called Wired Hessian) and Void of Light, a foreign-style stout that acquired gold at the 2014 GABF awards. Gun Hill might not have as much buzz as other Big Apple breweries, but the Bronx crew is worth visiting for an ounce or two.
Von Trapp Brewing (Stowe, Vermont): That name ring a bell? The Von Trapps are the eponymous family from “The Sound of Music.” Moreover, they operate a ski resort and lodge in mountainous Vermont, recently adding a brewery into the mix. Befitting the family's European heritage, the focus is textbook continental lagers, including the crispy and peppery Bohemian Pilsner, richly smooth Dunkel Lager, and the refreshing Golden Helles that could become your everyday glugger.
Night Shift (Everett, Massachusetts): The Boston-area brewery (named after the trio of brewing buddies whose homebrewing exploits lasted long past midnight) is among the best of the new breed of Northeast breweries doling out jazz-smooth, fogged-up pale ales and IPAs as fragrant as a bowlful of ripe fruit. Night Shift's bounty includes the Whirlpool pale ale and Santilli IPA, as well as a collection of Berliner weisses seasoned with the likes of strawberries and kiwis. But Night Shift is no one-trick pony: The brewery's brewed diversity includes the Pfaffenheck pilsner and Awake, a robust porter infused with coffee.
Cambridge Brewing Company (Cambridge, Massachusetts): It's easy to forget about breweries that have been around five years, much less a quarter-century. Old news, right? But some breweries get even better with age, especially Cambridge Brewing. Since 1989, Cambridge has just crushed it with everything from Belgian-style tripels to gruits, as well as peppercorn-laced farmhouse ales and one of America's most forward-thinking barrel programs. Recently, I've been a huge fan of their canned offerings, namely the brisk and beautiful Remain in Light pilsner. Brewmaster Will Meyers doesn't make bad beer.
Prison City Pub & Brewery (Auburn, New York): After a Paste Magazine blind tasting named Prison City's Mass Riot the country's best IPA out of 247 entrants, demand went haywire for brewer Ben Maeso's 6.4 percent ABV mainline hit of hazy, tropical goodness. Not bad for a little brewpub in upstate Auburn, home to the brewery's namesake maximum-security prison. Chain yourself to Prison City's table to sip some IPAs and whatever else Maeso has made.
Kane Brewing Company (Ocean Township, New Jersey): While working on Wall Street as an investment banker, Michael Kane refined his homebrewing skills, earning gold and silver in 2009's prestigious National Homebrew Competition. He soon left to launch his eponymous coastal New Jersey brewery, which since 2011 has cooked up spectacular IPAs, Belgian-inspired blondes and strong ales and Night to End All Dawns, a monstrous imperial stout mellowed in bourbon barrels for more than a year. No wonder it nabbed gold at GABF in 2014.
Other breweries (from other regions) I'm excited to try:
Scratch Brewing: Their foraged beers made with every bit of a tree were some of the most innovative beers I sipped last year.
Cervecerìa Cruz Blanca: This is the brewpub run by renowned Mexican chef Rick Bayless. Curious to see what they've cooked up.
Union Craft Brewing: I've heard great buzz about the Maryland brewery's Duckpin pale ale, done up with New Zealand and Pacific Northwest hops.
Fair State Brewing Cooperative: Scuttlebutt on the street is that the cooperatively run Twin Cities brewery is turning out stupendous sours.
Revelry Brewing: I popped by this Charleston outfit when I was in South Carolina this summer. Their foudre-aged sours were banging. I want more.
Melvin Brewing: No one does dank better than this Wyoming outfit. It's where I'll go when I want to bathe my taste buds in double IPA.
NEW YORK -- Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry had to make an afternoon trip to the dentist Saturday after experiencing discomfort, league sources told ESPN.
However, sources say the back-to-back MVP will be available to play Sunday afternoon at the New York Knicks.
Details of the visit are unknown at this time, as is the severity of the issue. He experienced discomfort following a noon practice and an afternoon Under Armour promotional appearance.
The Warriors, who have played 293 games since suffering a losing streak of three games or more, are looking to break a two-game skid. It's the longest stretch of games played without a three-game losing streak in NBA history.
Curry is 4-of-31 from 3-point range in the last three contests.
Golden State has won the last five meetings against New York.
U.S. on Track to Become Net Energy Exporter by 2026
The amount of energy Americans use and the pollution they emit from using coal, oil and natural gas are not likely to change radically over the next 30 years, even as the U.S. becomes a major energy exporter, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook, published Thursday.
The outlook, which does not factor in any policies from the incoming fossil fuel-friendly Trump administration, shows that the U.S. is unlikely to make significant gains in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet its obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement, even though zero-carbon renewables are expected to grow faster than any other energy source over the next three decades.

Electricity generation is expected to remain the largest single use of energy in the U.S., but crude oil use for transportation is expected to be the largest source of energy-related carbon emissions. Carbon emissions from transportation surpassed those from electric power generation for the first time in U.S history in 2016.
The U.S. is likely to become a major exporter of energy because it is expected to produce about 20 percent more energy than it does today through 2040 while using only about 5 percent more energy, said EIA administrator Adam Sieminsky.
“We're going to have fairly strong domestic production of energy and relatively flat demand,” he said. “You put those two together, it implies that the U.S. could become a net energy exporter.” And that could happen as soon as 2026.
That scenario, in addition to gains in energy efficiency across the country and declining coal consumption, will keep annual carbon emissions from energy use roughly level with today's — about 5.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to EIA data. Energy-related carbon emissions in the U.S. have been falling since they peaked at about 6 billion metric tons in 2007.
The EIA offers a variety of different projections for how Americans will produce and use energy in the coming decades. The scenario in which the U.S. emits the most carbon dioxide through 2040 is the one in which the Obama administration's signature climate change policy, the Clean Power Plan, is tossed out by the courts or the incoming Trump administration.
The Clean Power Plan, a major key to the success of the Paris Climate Agreement, was designed to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, encouraging utilities to generate more and more electricity using natural gas and renewables. But the plan's fate is in doubt because 24 states have sued to kill it, the Supreme Court has temporarily blocked it, and the incoming Trump administration has vowed to rescind it because it wants to revive the flagging coal industry.
The federal government is projecting that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from energy use will remain relatively steady in the coming decades.

Regardless of the fate of the Clean Power Plan, energy-related carbon emissions are not expected to change much. If the plan is rescinded or overturned, the U.S. will emit about 5.4 billion metric tons annually through 2040 — slightly higher than today. If the plan remains in place, emissions are expected to drop to about 5 billion metric tons annually.
The biggest change the EIA expects to see over the next 30 years is one that's already in progress today — Americans are expected to use more and more natural gas and renewables than they do now. Natural gas production is expected to grow 1.2 percent through 2050, with wind and solar power production growing 3.5 percent.
“If the Clean Power Plan is not implemented, if natural gas prices remain relatively low and the tax credits in the renewables area play out a little, we will see more natural gas in the future,” Sieminsky said.
The fracking boom in the U.S. over the past decade has flooded the country with natural gas, bringing prices down. Cheap natural gas, more so than climate regulations under the Clean Power Plan, has encouraged electric power companies to switch away from coal-fired power plants, which have always formed the backbone of the energy grid. The trend is expected to continue over the next 30 years.
For example, just this week, the operator of one of the West's largest coal-fired power plants, the Arizona's Navajo Generating Station northeast of the Grand Canyon, announced the plant and the coal mine that supplies it may close this year because of low natural gas prices, according to the Arizona Republic newspaper.
Despite growth in natural gas and renewables, the EIA expects coal production will continue a slow but gradual decline, falling only 0.7 percent through 2050.
Sieminsky said the decline in coal use in the U.S. will translate worldwide as well, and the fate of the Clean Power Plan isn't much of a factor in the long-term outlook for coal because utilities have already begun committing to using natural gas to generate electricity.
“Capital costs of building coal plants are high,” he said. “A lot of countries are moving away from coal for air pollution reasons. It's not a climate issue — it's more of a health issue.”
China, for example, has begun shuttering coal-fired power plants to reduce its urban smog — the worst in the world.

Cuyahoga County's new land bank, along with its partners, received nearly $41 million in federal stimulus funds to demolish blighted homes and renovate others in 20 targeted neighborhoods throughout the county.
Cities, counties and the state of Ohio received a total of $175 million out of $2 billion in awards the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced Thursday.
"Vacant homes have a debilitating effect on neighborhoods and often lead to reduced property values, blight, and neighborhood decay," HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan the said in a statement. "This additional $2 billion in Recovery Act funding will help stabilize hard hit communities by turning vacant homes into affordable housing opportunities."
The investment is "helping to eliminate blight, stabilize our community and stop the cycle of abandonment that has occurred. This program is truly helping to improve the quality of life in our region," said Councilman Anthony Brancatelli, chairman of the community & economic development committee.
The new county land bank, along with the city of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County and Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority, put in a joint proposal this summer asking for $74 million for 20 targeted neighborhoods.
Fifteen of the neighborhoods are in the Cleveland, and the others include parts of five inner-rung suburbs -- East Cleveland, Garfield Heights, Lakewood, South Euclid and Shaker Heights.
Gus Frangos, president of the land bank said the money will go to acquire abandoned and foreclosed homes in those areas, as well as vacant property.
He said those that still have "good bones" will be rehabbed and financial help will be given to low and moderate income families to purchase the homes with down-payment and closing cost assistance.
Homes that can't be saved will be demolished. The plan was to demolish more than 1,000 vacant homes.
One of the biggest challenges in Cleveland, now with about 380,000 residents, is what to do with the vacant land, Frangos said. And the group's proposal is to turn some of the land into community gardens, parks and even urban forests.
"By rebuilding neighborhoods devastated by the economic crisis, we will improve surrounding property values, create new jobs, and foster long-term economic growth," Sen. Sherrod Brown, said in a statement after joining Donovan in Columbus for the announcement of the awards. "By putting vacant properties and lots to good use and targeting funds to the hardest-hit communities, we can rebuild our downtown's and strengthen our communities.'
The HUD money awarded Thursday, part of the $737 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act plan, was a competitive process, and applicants such as counties, cities non-profits and others had to detail how they would tackle neighborhoods with high foreclosure or vacancy rates.
"Cleveland and the county have been hard hit by the global economic crisis and these additional ... funds will help to rebuild our neighborhoods, providing our residents with affordable homes in revitalized communities," said Mayor Frank G. Jackson.

The abiding falsehood, the lazy trope, is that Northern Ireland's conflict was about religion. The idea that the Marxist atheists of the IRA were trying to force young Protestants to morning Mass, or that the heathen gunmen of the UDA were fighting for the pre-eminence of Justification by Faith is somewhat wide of the mark.
Northern Ireland's bloody history is about power and loyalty. It is, in the parlance of political science, an ethno-national conflict. In plain English, two different groups want the same territory to be part of two different states. Religion may be an identifier to the participant groups in the conflict, but it isn't the cause of it.
Unfortunately, though, elections inevitably become a tribal carve-up. The 'sectarian headcount' as it's often known. Unionists (who are, yes, overwhelming Protestant) vote for unionist parties and Irish nationalists (yes, usually Catholic) vote for the nationalist SDLP or Sinn Fein.
As a result, not many alters in terms of control of the 18 Westminster seats up for grabs. However, gradual population changes are beginning to make a few seats more competitive.
For instance, the combined nationalist vote in places like Fermanagh and South Tyrone and Belfast North should be enough to wrest them from unionist MPs.
The problem for nationalists, though, is that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein stand in these seats, splitting the vote. So the Ulster Unionist, Tom Elliot, holds Fermanagh and South Tyrone, while the Democratic Unionists' deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, is MP for Belfast North. However, given 2017 is turning out to be a stinker for Unionism, both men are still vulnerable. Unionists are on the back foot and they know it. Their political leaders need a decent showing in the general election to steady nerves and hold what on to what they have.
Across the city in the once staunchly-unionist citadel of east Belfast, a different threat has emerged in recent years. The seat fell to the cross-community Alliance party back in 2010 before the DUP managed to recapture it at the last general election.
These days, the sense that Northern Ireland is slipping away from unionists is palpable. The shockwaves from the recent assembly elections, where Sinn Fein surged to within a single seat of supplanting the DUP as the largest party, are still being felt.
So it's no surprise there is talk of a unionist pact between the Democratic Unionists and the Ulster Unionists – bitter rivals - to maximise the chances of unionist victory in these few battleground seats.
Pacts are rarer on the nationalist side of the aisle. The SDLP doesn't like the idea of sectarian head-counting in principle, but they don't like Sinn Fein much either.
In the 2015 election, Sinn Fein's candidate, the veteran republican Gerry Kelly, caused a bit of a stir when he put out a leaflet in North Belfast pointing out that Catholics now narrowly outnumbered Protestants in the seat by 46.9% to 45.6%.
Nevertheless, there has been chatter for a couple of weeks about an anti-Brexit pact between Sinn Fein, the SDLP and even the Alliance party, punishing the hard Brexiteers of the DUP. This is interesting. It rebadges the concept of an anti-unionist pact in terms of tactical opposition to Brexit. (After all, Northern Ireland voted 56% to ‘Remain'). Of course, this echoes similar discussions among British opposition parties towards the Tories.
Yet despite an initial flurry of excitement, it seems the tide may now be going out on the idea. Yesterday, the two unionist parties conceded that they have failed to agree the terms of a pact, an endeavour not helped, in all probability, with the new Ulster Unionist leader, Robin Swann, only being in the job for a few weeks, following Mike Nesbitt's resignatio over the party's disappointing assembly election performance back in March.
Meanwhile, the SDLP has rebuffed Sinn Fein's suggestion to step down in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and Belfast North, with its leader, Colum Eastwood, saying it will 'stand on its own two feet in this election.' So be it. This means at least three nail-biting contests which may still see loose inter-party co-operation on the ground.
In Belfast North, Sinn Fein still has a trump card. The party is running John Finucane as its candidate. As the surname suggests, he is the son of the murdered solicitor Patrick Finucane, who was gunned down in 1989 during a home invasion by loyalist killers working for the British state.
His killing, one of the bleakest in the catalogue of Troubles-era murders, remains a running sore to nationalists following David Cameron's U-turn on establishing a judicial inquiry into his case.
The Finucane name and the dignity of the family in their on-going pursuit of justice may prove electorally potent in galvanising the nationalist vote. It doesn't hurt that John Finucane, a solicitor himself, is also a prominent former Gaelic footballer.
In East Belfast, the leader of the Alliance party, Naomi Long, is looking to retake the seat she first snatched from then DUP leader Peter Robinson in 2010. Long is a canny and attractive politician and it's hardly credible for the DUP to characterise her as a nationalist threat. The lack of a deal between the two biggest unionist parties will presumably help her split the unionist vote. She is further helped by the pro-Remain 'Open Britain' group supporting her in a seat where the gap between Leavers and Remainers last June was just 1700 votes.
So Unionism has a fight on its hands, potentially losing two or three of the seats it currently holds. The upshot is that if the DUP cannot hold the eight Westminster seats it currently has and if the UUP's Tom Elliot loses to Sinn Fein in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, then the slough of despond unionists currently find themselves wallowing in will feel all the deeper.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is preparing to post to its website information about waivers it has granted to ex-lobbyists working in the president's office.
Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says the information will be available before the Thursday deadline set by the Office of Government Ethics.
A letter Friday from the Office of Management and Budget says the rest of the executive branch — departments such as Treasury, State and Defense — also will comply.
Similar information was shared with the ethics office during the Obama administration. OGE Director Walter Shaub had asked President Donald Trump to continue that tradition, formally making a request last month.
As part of Trump's promise to “drain the swamp” of Washington, the president continued an Obama-era two-year prohibition of lobbyists and lawyers hired into the executive branch from working on “particular” government matters that involved their former clients.
Reports, including one by The New York Times and the investigative journalism venture ProPublica, noted that some new Trump administration employees appeared to be working in government on the very same issues they had once tackled as lobbyists — raising questions about how many waivers have been granted so far.
In his letter, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney writes that Shaub misunderstood an earlier letter in which he'd asked for more time. Mulvaney writes that he had wanted to explore legal issues connected to what he said was a broad and unusual request for information.
“Put another way, our concern was, and is, protecting the process related to the data call,” Mulvaney writes. “We have no objection to the substance of the call.”
OMB itself has not issued any exceptions to the lobbyist rules set by the Trump administration, Mulvaney writes in the letter.
Earlier this week, Shaub had forcefully declined Mulvaney's initial request for a “stay” of the data call. “OGE is exercising its authority and independence appropriately,” Shaub noted in a letter to Mulvaney on Monday.

Decorating a Christmas tree usually involves spools of electric Christmas lights, store-bought and homemade ornaments, with a star or angel resting at the top. All this happens before those Christmas Gifts show up from that special delivery person. Yet these traditions are a result of modern conveniences. When Christmas Trees first rose to prominence in the United States, they were often decorated with fruits and other items. From this, a tradition of stringing popcorn and cranberries into a garland that wrapped around the tree was born.
So the question is – why was fruit originally put on the tree? Here's a little Christmas tree history.
Before Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, many pagan rituals involved having a live evergreen tree or branch in the home. The reasons varied and included wishes of prosperity and luck with the harvest. In medieval Germany (around 1500), full pine trees were brought into the home to celebrate the Name Day of Adam and Eve (December 24th). The families would decorate the tree with apples in honor of the two. These trees were called Paradise Trees in reference to where Adam and Eve met.
Over time, Paradise Trees evolved into Christmas trees, a tradition mostly only celebrated in Germany. In the 18th and 19th centuries when many Germans immigrated to the United States, they would sometimes bring the tradition with them. However it was viewed as a foreign custom and didn't quite catch on in America. That is until Christmas 1848.
The Queen of England, Queen Victoria was married to a German, Prince Albert. In the winter of 1848, Queen Victoria asked to have a Christmas tree put up for the holiday as it was something Prince Albert had as a child for Christmas. Soon the story of the Royal Christmas Tree was published in the newspapers with an illustration depicting the tree in the palace, and the tradition spread throughout Europe and over to North America.
So again, how did popcorn end up on our Christmas trees? While its origins are not completely known, the art of stringing popcorn on a tree most likely came from the fact that when Christmas trees first became widespread, people didn't have much to decorate them with. They borrowed from the German tradition of putting fruit on the trees and because cranberries are harvested through November, it's most likely that they were strung with popcorn as they were still in season.
Today, many people purchase artificial popcorn wreaths while some families still thread twine or dental floss through popcorn and cranberries to make a holiday garland. It is common practice to make garlands with real cranberries and popcorn to string on outside evergreens to give birds, squirrels, and other wild life a treat for the holidays!
In very general terms, my advice for playing with your pets is the same as it's always been: use the pets you like the best. I've said before that my first 25 was my Perky Pug Bertha. She's mediocre at best for fighting, but she's still my favorite pet, and despite her questionable utility I still use her to fight when I can. If you don't feel any connection to your pets, you're not going to enjoy playing nearly as much.
That said, I've noticed that there are a few pets I use constantly, both in PVP and PVE, and see others recommend (or complain about as being totally OP) as well. That's the basis of this list. I'm not telling you to level these first. Some of them are pretty bad until higher levels, so I wouldn't recommend just grabbing 3 of these pets from level 1 and making a run of it. But if the option presents itself, keep these pets in mind. Completely unironically, I've done pet profiles on most of these individually, too.
Anubisath Idol – Between the Humanoid racial heal, his big hits and damage avoidance, the Anubisath Idol makes a lot of fights trivial. I've seen a few carry guides which include the Anubisath in nearly every Pandaria tamer fight. I resisted it for a while, but come 5.4 you're going to be glad you have one of these puppies.
Speed Breed Rabbit – I made a whole post on why Rabbits, and specifically Speed Breed Rabbits, are fantastic. They do well in both PVE and PVP, especially with undead teams being in vogue right now, and they're one of the original pets you could have so they're super easy to get too.
Crab – Another one that's easy to get, crabs are fantastic tanks for PVE, and can swap and be damage dealing juggernauts in PVP. Breed is debatable. I prefer the Power breeds, but some tamers like starting out with high Health. It's up to you and what you're after… or, because they're so plentiful in the wild, you can stock up on all of them.
Gilnean Raven – An excellent damage dealer with a lot of tricks up its little birdy sleeve. The Darkness weather ability makes life easy against healers. I also love the underutilized literary reference Nevermore ability. Big damage is nice, but shutting down your opponent's offense is just sweet.
Clockwork Gnome – A teeny powerhouse with heals, damage over time, and big mech hits. This was one of the very first pets I leveled up, and he's still a favorite to use.
Terrible Turnip – This is a little bit off the topic, so it doesn't count toward the 5. The Terrible Turnip is kind of awful. I've seen it a few times in PVP as a “wait bait” pet (meaning, they turtle until you get fed up and forfeit, handing them the win). But its utility in trapping pets makes it absolutely crucial to have. I wouldn't make this your very first 25, but when you get more than 5 you should consider it.

Is Killing "Leaders" Useful Or Not - CentCom Can't Make Up Its Mind
A contrasting juxtaposition in my Twitter feed:
bigger
First the U.S. Central Command tweet with this statement by the commander of the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, General Nicholson:
GENERAL NICHOLSON STATEMENT ON THE KILLING OF THE THIRD ISIS-K EMIR BY U.S. AND AFGHAN FORCES IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS
...
"This operation is another success in our campaign to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan in 2017," said Nicholson. "Abu Sayed is the third ISIS-K emir we have killed in the last year and we will continue until they are annihilated. There is no safe haven for ISIS-K in Afghanistan." [bold added]
Then the Micah Zenko tweet with this interview with the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Votel. Votel is the direct superior of the above Nicholson:
Q: ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi — dead or alive? And does it matter anymore? Votel: [..] I hope that he is (dead), frankly. [..] That said, we've been doing this long enough to know that leaders are killed and we've killed plenty of them. And that there's always somebody who is going to step up into those positions so we shouldn't think that just killing Baghdadi is the key here. He can be replaced. So in that regard, it may not matter as much. [bold added]
Nicholson says he can win the war against XYZ by killing a bunch of successive XYZ "leaders". Votel rightly says that this is clearly not so. During sixteen years of War of Terror and constant killing of various "emirs" special boilerplate statements were prepared for the typical "victory" announcements. Votel seems to have understood that such killings do not matter. His direct subordinate Nicholson did not. Shouldn't they talk to each other about such issues?
But it may well be that Votel would have sounded very different if his troops had killed Baghdadi and not a Russian(!) air strike.

The Prospects
These highlights will focus on players who contributed goals or assists last night as well as goalie prospect Connor Ingram. Otto Somppi (Halifax Mooseheads) was held off the score sheet as his team lost 5-2 and were eliminated from the playoffs.
Brett Howden (#21 in red) picked up an assist as his Moose Jaw Warriors lost 3-2 to the Swift Current Broncos. The Warriors were eliminated from the playoffs.
Two days ago, Connor Ingram (#39 in white) stopped 31 of 34 shots for the Kamloops Blazers who fell 4-2 to the Kelowna Rockets and were eliminated from the playoffs. Ingram was awarded second star of the game for his effort. Video highlights are now available.
The Game
"The NHL announced on Monday afternoon that it will not be sending players to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, saying that 'no meaningful dialogue has materialized' in negotiations with the International Olympic Committee, the NHL Players' Association, and the International Ice Hockey Federation." [SB Nation]
Elliotte Friedman shared his thoughts on that decision. "It's bad. But, the honest truth is that this is business, not unicorn world. The NHL owners are taking all the risk and the IOC isn't the most sympathetic organization. The problem with hockey negotiations in the last 25 years is that they aren't about what's best for the game. No one does anything unless they get something." [Sportsnet]
Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk opens up about the struggles of being a patient in need of an organ transplant. “When you need a transplant for a major organ, you're put on a list. Most people may know that. But the process of finding a donor who matches, performing surgery, hoping that the body accepts the match and praying that it all happens as quickly as possible was something I had no idea about.” [The Players' Tribune]
Jaromir Jagr is looking forward to playing more hockey next year, his 24th NHL season. “I still love the game and still want to get better every day I step on the ice. Nothing has changed for the last 20 years I play hockey, so the drive is still there.” [Puck Daddy]
DOVER, Del., Oct. 17 (UPI) -- A Delaware man's lawsuit alleges he awoke from anesthesia after a colonoscopy procedure to find he had been dressed in a pair of pink panties.
The New Castle County Superior Court lawsuit, filed by attorney Gary Nitsche on behalf of Andrew Walls, 32, said Walls was employed by the Delaware Surgery Center in Dover when he underwent a colonoscopy procedure at the facility in 2012.
Nitsche said his client was put under anesthesia during the procedure and he awoke after surgery to find someone had dressed him in pink women's underwear.
"When the plaintiff initially presented for his colonoscopy he had not been wearing pink women's underwear and at no time did the plaintiff voluntarily, knowingly or intentionally place the pink women's underwear upon himself," the lawsuit states.
Jennifer Anderson, director of the Delaware Surgery Center, declined to comment Wednesday. "We just found out about this yesterday afternoon," she told the News Journal.
The lawsuit, which also names the Eden Hill Surgical Group of Dover, alleges Walls suffered "severe emotional stress," and Nitsche wrote his client is seeking compensation for mental anguish, lost wages and loss of earning capacity.
Community mapping applications come in all shapes and sizes. There are apps to help drivers avoid speed traps, maneuver around traffic jams, and find cheap gas. And now there's one that helps people avoid being pulled from their car by the Ershad—Iran's morals police.
Anonymous developers in Iran recently released an Android app that is intended to help young Iranians share intelligence about Ershad checkpoints. Called "Gershad," the app depends on crowdsourced reports from users to help others avoid being stopped, harassed, or even possibly beaten or arrested for failing to adhere to the Ershad interpretations of Islamic morality.
The app was highlighted by Nima Akbarpour, the presenter of Persian Click (a technology show on BBC's Persian service).
Ershad is Persian for "guidance," and the Ershad patrols are given a great deal of leeway in providing moral guidance to the public. They set up mobile morality checkpoints to check for "immoral behavior"—women wearing too much makeup or failing to cover their heads, men wearing clothing or hairstyles with too much of a Western influence, or unmarried men and women traveling together are a few examples. The Ershad can issue warnings, demand formal written statements of "repentance," or arrest and prosecute people at their discretion.
On their Google Play page, the app developers cite law enforcement statistics from 2014, during which more than 3 million people were stopped and warned by the Ershad, 207,000 people were forced to write statements, and 18,000 were "sent to court." "Why do we have to be humiliated for our most obvious right which is the right to wear what we want?" the developers wrote. "Social media networks and websites are full of footage and photos of innocent women who have been beaten up and dragged on the ground by the Ershad patrol agents."
The use of the app, as some users have noted, is itself a protest against the Ershad. And the developers clearly want as many people to download and use the free app as possible to join that protest. "If a city has a large number of citizens using Gershad and reporting patrols seriously, Gershad will be very accurate... We will try our best to provide good support, but ultimately it is you who decide about success and failure of Gershad."

In 2006, 1,224 Joneses descended on the city of Cardiff in Wales with just one mission: to be themselves.
Upon arriving at the city's Millennium Centre they were greeted with live performances by Grace Jones and the opera soprano Dame Gwyneth Jones. Video messages of support were sent by the actress Catherine Zeta-Jones and the singer Tom Jones. By the end of the evening they had successfully smashed the record for the largest gathering of people with the same surname in the world, more than doubling the previous effort held by a mustering of Norbergs in Sweden.
The choice of Wales for such a convocation was a no-brainer. Jones is one of the most popular surnames in the world but Wales is the Jones capital. Close to 15 percent of its population shares the surname, creating a veritable superabundance of Joneses in the small country. Indeed when Wales took part in the Six Nations Rugby Championship in 2008 there were seven players on the 15-man team called Jones, causing occasional difficulties for the commentators.

We define ourselves by our names. They are the signifiers of our individuality, words chosen just for us, at birth. So what happened that allowed a Victorian genealogist to declare that the name Jones “is in Wales a perpetual incognito”? What's it like living in a place, where, according to the same genealogist, someone calls out your name in the street “would indicate no one in particular”?
Up until the mid-15th century Wales blossomed with an astonishing variety of nomenclature. This was in part due to the 9th century Welsh king and all-round top chap, Hywel the Good, who declared that in order to own land, Welshmen had to trace their descendants back to the original holders of the land. With the addition of the handy participle “ap” (meaning “son of”) names became portable genealogies used to list a person's forefathers. These patronymic names could run on almost indefinitely so that a handle such as ‘Iwan ap Gwalchmai ap Gruffud ap Milyr ap Llewelyn ap Gwasmihangel' would not have been uncommon.

However these spittle-drenched ancestral roll calls were dealt a deathblow in 1536 when Henry VIII—himself hardly a model of cognominate originality—decided to incorporate Wales into neighboring England. The Act of Union that was drawn up declared that English would be the only language of the courts and that those using the Welsh language would be forbidden from holding public office. In the past parents who would have named their child after the ancient pagan heroes and gods of Wales, like Llywarch or Gwalchmai, were now forced to choose from a small basket of politically expedient Anglicized names like John and David.
Adding to the general anxiety felt around Wales's baptismal fonts was the fact that Henry had just cleaved England from the Catholic Church, so kick-ass consonant-heavy Catholic devotional names like Gwasdewi (devotee of St. David) or Gwasmihangel (follower of the archangel Michael), were also ruled out. As Professor Prys Morgan, co-author of the essential bedtime read, Welsh Surnames, describes, the Welsh clung to the patronymic naming tradition, but this name had now to be fixed not added to with each generation. The popularity of John as a safe apolitical name—the Welsh language doesn't even have a letter “J” in it–quickly saw Jones (“John's son”) spread like wildfire through the valleys.

For centuries the name Jones thus became a kind of anti-identity, a name that didn't get you into trouble, a name whose ubiquity was itself a kind of anonymity.
This began to change in 1913 when the cartoonist Arthur “Pop” Momand created a comic strip called Keeping up with the Joneses. The strip dealt with the tribulations of modern American life and although the Joneses in the story are never seen, they are constantly alluded to. The phrase became shorthand for social climbing and the economic anxieties tied to what Thorstein Veblen termed “conspicuous consumption.” As such the name “Jones” became a sort of modern-day ”everyman”, a symbol of mankind's contemporary foibles.

In the early 1950s a further shift began to take place. The name Jones garnered increasingly exciting connotations. “Mr. Jones” was beatnik slang for a drug dealer, the name's frequency providing a codename-like anonymity for illicit deals. Subsequently “Jonesing” came to mean a craving for heroin and then slowly morphed into any longing or craving. We now “jones” for a doughnut or for a soda. (Some suggest that “Jonesing” took its name from drug-addled Jones Alley in New York City). Picking up speed on the back of these hip street credentials the names Jones transformed itself even further. According to Cassell's Dictionary of Slang, “jones” came to mean not only a Black person but also a euphemism for a penis, as memorialized in the squirm-inducing Frank Zappa song “Jones Crusher.” The name Jones had been square for so long it was now cool.

The appeal of Jones is built into the very word. Arthur Momand had originally planned on calling his comic strip, “Keeping Up With the Smiths” but had preferred “the Joneses” as being more euphonious. Indeed with its single stressed syllable that slides out of the mouth almost before it has begun, Jones became the perfect surname not for dullness but for adventure. Cleopatra Jones, Jessica Jones, Indiana Jones, Jughead Jones are all fictional characters of remarkable cool with names to match. In these names Jones acts as the solid straight man to the riotous first name, a mellifluous buddy riding shotgun on the appellation stagecoach.
But even in its ubiquity, Jones is by no means alone. In 2007, a gathering of 1488 Gallaghers in Letterkenny, Ireland, stole the record for the largest gathering of people with the same surname. Joneses still have reason to celebrate, though. What began as a name of subjugation and enforced anonymity slowly, over the course of half a millennium, became a name of funky, virile adventure.

Socialist Alliance (Australia) statement
Israel's killing must stop! Stand up for the people of Gaza! End ties with the racist Israeli state!
The Socialist Alliance condemns the Israeli massacre in the Gaza strip, which has left at least 280 people dead and 800 more injured. We call on the Rudd government to also condemn this slaughter and to break Australian economic, diplomatic, military and cultural ties with the Israeli apartheid state.
While Israel claimed that it targeted “terrorists”, the 100 bombs were mostly aimed at police stations in the middle of densely populated civilian areas. The attack, which was carefully planned at least several days in advance, also took place at the same time as children were going home from school, leaving many dead or injured.
The massacre comes on the back of two years of blockade imposed by Israel in an attempt to topple the democratically elected Hamas government. Many Gazans have already died due to lack of basic medical treatment, food, clean water and electricity.
The killing looks set to continue with large numbers of Israeli armored vehicles massing on the border of Gaza. Israel has called up 6500 reservists and has announced that it will call up more over the next few days.
If the massacres are to stop international public opinion needs to let Israel know that its actions are unacceptable. In particular, Israel's traditional supporters , who have clearly sanctioned this bloody operation, must be forced to withdraw their support.
The Australian people need to stand up for the people of Gaza by making the Rudd government end its support for Israel's ethnic cleansing of Palestine. Socialist Alliance urges its members and supporters to join all emergency protests that are being organised around the country against this latest crime of the Israeli state.

The Socialist Alliance's policy on Palestine
Adopted at the Sixth National Conference, December 6-7, 2008
The Socialist Alliance condemns the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by the state of Israel. This oppression takes different forms—the occupation of the Palestinian Territories, the siege of Gaza, the breaking up of the West Bank into isolated ghettos, systematic violence and discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel or exile as refugees.
The Socialist Alliance supports:
The Palestinian right to self determination.
Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories
Equal civil and democratic rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine.
Right of return for Palestinian refugees.
An end to Israeli aggression against other countries in the region.
An end to the restriction of movement of people and supplies (including medical supplies) around Palestine and between Palestine and Israel.
The Socialist Alliance recognises the essential role that international (including Australian) imperialism plays in supporting the Israeli system of apartheid and occupation through massive political, economic and military aid.
Therefore, the Socialist Alliance supports the International campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions of Israeli Apartheid.

In 2009, Chris Cornell released his third solo album, Scream. The record saw the Soundgarden frontman team with renowned hip-hop producer Timbaland to disappointing results. Despite debuting high up on the charts of the Billboard 200, sales quickly tapered off. It wasn't just the fans who were left feeling unfulfilled, either, as Scream was panned almost universally by music critics — it currently holds a paltry 42% score on Metacritic — as well as by Cornell's own peers.
Trent Reznor in particular had some harsh words for the Cornell album. In a tweet heard 'round the world, the Nine Inch Nails leader wrote: “You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable? Heard Chris Cornell's record? Jesus.” The social media take quickly caused waves throughout the alt-rock community and its fans.
Now, in a new Rolling Stone article chronicling the final days before the grunge icon's tragic passing, Reznor has revealed that he had written an apology to Cornell prior to Soundgarden and NIN's joint 2014 tour. “He was very cool and generous about it – ‘It's the past, fuck it. Let's go on,'” Reznor recalled. “The Chris I met on that tour was a gentleman that completely had his shit together.”
In retrospect, he now sees his pointed Twitter comments as something of an impulsive outburst, one which he “immediately regretted.” “Seeing Chris do that record felt like a blow to me,” Reznor said, looking back. “I thought, ‘He's above that, man. He's one of the 10 best vocalists of our time.'”
Read the full article, which includes additional anecdotes from members of Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains, here.
The music world continues to mourn the loss of Cornell, with Eddie Vedder, the surviving members of Audioslave, and Guns N' Roses paying tribute to the fallen rocker over Memorial Day weekend.

Head of Xbox Phil Spencer answered questions from fans on his Twitter last night and revealed some interesting clues as to what Microsoft is preparing for this year's E3 and beyond.
One fan asked him “which now-marginalized genres do you think might see a resurgence this gen?” To which Spencer responded “RTS on console.” This is particularly interesting since we recently learned via a job listing on Microsoft's careers page that Microsoft Studios is looking for someone "to help build and lead the team for a new AAA title within an established and well-loved strategy game franchise."
As we noted when we first learned the news, Age of Empires and Halo Wars are two RTS franchises that fit that description well. Spencer also told IGN earlier this year that he thought the original Halo Wars, which was exclusive to Xbox 360, was fun and expressed interest in seeing a new one. He also suggested it was possible that such a game could be developed internally due to there not being many "great RTS developers out there anymore."
Some other interesting things Spencer said:
With E3 2014 nearly upon us, GameSpot has everything you need to know about the show.

No one wants to pay for the government they want.
Limousine liberals like the redistribution of income from the working class to the shareholding class. Last year, the Dow (DJIA) went up 27 percent in one year. This meteoric rise from 6500 in March 2009 (just six weeks after Obama took office) to 16,500 on Dec. 31, 2013, is astounding. The millionaires' club called the U.S. Senate loves it, but it's bankrupting the U.S.
Wages are tanking. Benefits are suddenly no more. Unionized autoworker new hires make half what the old hires make through Obama's Auto Bailout to match all the non-union riceburner plants down South mostly where the most poverty also still resides. Louisiana and Mississippi are 49 and 50.
We export jobs to places that pay $2 a day like Bangladesh and expect American workers to compete in the free global market and then whine that 47 percent don't pay income taxes and instead get tax refund wage supplements like earned income credit.
But "free markets" don't apply to the wealthy employees called CEOs who rely on the government to subsidize their workers.
Pick one: Mr. Ski-bum uninsured adrenaline junkie or Ms. Medicaid mom minimum wage earner or citizen under-the-table contract workers (once called employees) end up in the emergency room and two things happen: They get Medicaid (AKA your taxes) to pay the hospital or they file bankruptcy. And bill-skipping bankruptcies are a huge driver of exploding healthcare costs.
It's not complicated. The cost of a deadbeat customer is borne by the paying customers.
Retailers call it shrinkage, most call it stealing. Bad debts are spread over the good debts, so the good debts rise, shocking as that may be.
The government sees this unsustainable folly and gives us the Affordable Care Act, even though we're all holding our nose. It really stinks. I hate it too.
But demonizing the ACA is a little like a cancer patient railing against chemotherapy. Chemo kills too many good cells and fails far more than we like, but how else can the cancer of irresponsibility be handled? Evidently deadbeat patients and freeloaders matter. Someone always pays.
I remember Idaho congressman Steve Symms coming to my civics class in Sandpoint 40 years ago to say, "There is no such thing as a free lunch." Guess what, there still isn't.
And now too many employers are paying employees as contractors with a 1099 replacing a W-2. As a contractor, one pays both halves of the payroll taxes, no unemployment ever again, and no benefits of any kind. Again, the government gets to pay the unexpected hospital bill eventually.
We need to re-acronym TANF (temporary aid for needy families) and just call it ANF because the income redistribution from the working class to the shareholding class is hardly temporary. Say hello to more socialism!
The socialism cow we already had in the ditch in 2008 because health insurance became too exclusive and too expensive didn't work too well, either. So we spray painted the cow with the Affordable Care Act and pretend it just got there. Same socialism cow. Different day.
But the stock market rose 27 percent in 2013. It's all good! The annual stockholders' report said so.

Iran Air CEO Farhad Parvaresh said the Iranian national carrier has signed in to an agreement with Boeing aircraft manufacturing company to purchase 80 airplanes.
Managing Director of Iran's national carrier, Iran Air (Homa), Farhad Parvaresh made the remarks on the sidelines of agreement signing ceremony today in Tehran between Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran Air) and directors of Boeing Company at the presence of Iran's Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Ahmad Akhundi.
Parvaresh underlined that 50 of the aircraft will be of Boeing 737 model which is a short- to medium-range twinjet narrow-body airliner.
“The other 30 airplanes will be Boeing 777 long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliners,” highlighted the official noting that deliveries will be made to Iran Air over a ten-year time span.
Representative of Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems, said the deal with Iran was finalized with approval of the US government.
The official, while stressing that the contract was worth 16.6 billion dollars, said Boeing had sealed the final agreement to sell 80 commercial aircraft to Iran upon receiving necessary permits from the goverment of the US.
The Boeing official recalled that the final document signed today followed the Memorandum of Understanding inked earlier in June; “we are pleased that Boeing has one more resumed cooperation with Iran,” he observed.
Bahawalpur: October 20, 2016. (PCP) Islamic Republic of Pakistan is on passage of cold era communist states, Saudi Arabia, China and some other Islamic countries where Christianity is taken as security threat and Christians are prohibited to gather in Houses to offer their worship or prayers.
In city of Bahawalpur which is the biggest city in Southern Punjab of Punjab province of Pakistan, the administration have issued orders that Christian can offer Sunday Prayers in Church Buildings only not in Houses.
There are only four Church Buildings in city of Bahawalpur which belong to Catholic Church of Pakistan and Church of Pakistan which were built before independence of Pakistan in 1947 or before 1971.
The permissions to build new Churches in Pakistan are not granted if the site is within 200 meters from any Mosque or 100 meters away from Muslim residential area. It is also undertaken by new Church builder missions that they will not use loudspeakers during prayers and their services timing will not tally with Muslim prayers in Mosques in that locality. The hoisting of Cross on gates of new Church buildings also need special permission and undertaking of missions.
After 2000, the evangelical Church missions started their preaching in Pakistan and millions of congregates of Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists and Presbyterians joined it. These Evangelical Churches have small number of membership and very limited funds from contributions that's why unable to build Church building and offer their prayers and Sunday Services in Houses of their Pastors or Houses of members. Such Churches are also called House Churches in Pakistan like many other countries where Christianity is under oppression.
When Pakistan Christian Post contacted office of Deputy Commissioner of city of Bahawalpur to enquire about new orders of restrictions of offering of Sunday Services for Christians in Houses, none was ready to answer our questions but we were informed that In July 2016, such orders were issued on complaint of Muslims who are disturbed by Prayers of Christians.
The sources close to Muslim religious leaders in Bahawalpur told PCP on condition of not disclosing his name “Bahawalpur is headquartered of one banned Muslim outfit and member of that militant group had put pressure on city administration to ban Christian prayers in city”
Southern Punjab is a safe haven of Islamic extremists and militant groups where administration of Punjab government is paralyzed and obeys their orders and it is planning to ban House Prayers of Christians in other cities after Bahawalpur.
Dr. Nazir S Bhatti have said in a statement that orders of banning Christian prayers of Sunday in Houses in Bahawalpur have spread fear among millions of Christians in Punjab province of Pakistan.
Nazir Bhatti have urged Chief Minister of Punjab Mian Shahbaz Sharif and Interior Minister government of Pakistan Ch. Nisar Ali to take immediate notice of banning House Churches Sunday prayer in city of Bahawalpur because it is against religious freedom and guarantees provided to religious minorities in constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
8:01 CT: The Brokaw neck jerk leads off the night.
8:02 CT: Obama with the coin flip win.
8:05 CT: McCain probably should have gotten either a shorter stool or a taller stool. It doesn't matter but he should have made a decision, he looks pained.
8:06 CT: Apparently keeping taxes low fixes the bad loans that are crushing the economy.
8:07 CT: "We need to stabilize home values," says John McCain. That is excellent, how do we do this Mr. McCain? "I know how we can fix this economy," John rhetorically responds, but never actually tells us how he will do it.
8:11 CT: What was that Brokaw rant about.
8:12 CT: Anybody who owns a home has heard of either Fannie May or Freddie Mac, John. Their logo is all over mortage documents.
8:13 CT: Obama looks very comfortable in his bar stool.
8:14 CT: "I have to correct some of John McCain's history, not surprising," marks Obama first zinger of the night.
8:19 CT: Section "F," what a segue Mr. Brokaw.
8:20 CT: Nothing has happened so far.
8:20 CT: "The system in washing is broken, I have been a consistent reformer...Senator Obama has never taken on the leaders of his party." Senator Obama has not been in a position during a period in time where the Democratic leadership was wrong.
8:22 CT: McCain agreed that he would not go into the audience, and he just walked between the seating divisions. Clearly against the rules.
8:24 CT: Apparently McCain thinks he can conquer the three biggest issues of our election but yet he cannot campaign and help push the bailout bill. Sounds like a contradiction.
8:26 CT: Some of the "700 Billion that goes overseas is going to terrorists," I have no idea where McCain is getting this number from.
8:28 CT: Why does McCain want a spending freeze on everything but defense?
8:33 CT: I do not want to another image of McCain sitting awkwardly in his chair. I'm glad he's standing now.
8:36 CT: To bad health insurance costs more than $5,000.
8:37 CT: The Social Security question is now out in the open.
8:38 CT: Brokaw says Obama cannot talk about taxes, so Obama takes the next question and responds to the tax question anyway.
8:39 CT: If a small business is useful to society it becomes a big business. A small business should not get tax breaks, unless they contribute to society. You are not special because you have a small business.
8:40 CT: "Social Security is not that tough," what is your plan then Mr. McCain. I do not care about Tip O'Neil. If you want us to have a commission to solve social security with the smartest people in America, while you be in that Commission Mr. McCain.
8:42 CT: I do not care what section the question is coming from Tom Brokaw.
8:44 CT: McCain is trying to distance himself from the Bush Administration on the environment, nobody cares. Apparently John thinks Japan is an example of reusing Nuclear Fuel but Japan is not allowed to have Nuclear fuel. That was part of the Geneva convention. The people who tried to take over the world are not allowed to have Nuclear.
8:48 CT: McCain simply does not understand the concept of the Manhattan Project reference in the question. It has nothing to do with Nuclear it has to do with funding a purely scientific project to conquer the energy problem.
8:50 CT: Why is McCain just pacing in the background. In 2000 Gore startled Bush in a debate so they have not set aside a specific region in which the candidate can be. McCain is all over the place.
8:53 CT: "Obama keeps talking about what the government will do," that is correct Mr. McCain. The reason he believes in the government achieving these objectives is because the private sector has not adequately provided for the citizens, in Obama's opinion.
8:55 CT: McCain's joke fell entirely flat. I know the crowd is allowed to make noise, but there was definitely laughter in the VP debate.
8:55 CT: "With the plan I have that will do that." Thanks, what is your plan Mr. McCain?
8:56 CT: "Health care should be a right," Barack Obama.
8:57 CT: "McCain voted against expanding health care for children," Barack Obama.
8:59 CT: "Did we hear the size of the fine?" I have no idea what McCain was referring to.
9:00 CT: I'm glad McCain understands the concept of Universal Instantiation.
9:05 CT: "We're not going to be able to be everywhere at anytime," is the essence of the Obama Doctrine on humanitarian combat operations.
9:08 CT: "We ended up having to withdraw in humiliation." Wow John, sounds an awful lot like the current situation. Lebanon seems to have turned out okay.
9:10 CT: "The young men and women in our military our my number one priority, after our country," sounds fairly fascist to me. You have two cows, the government kills you and takes them.
9:12 CT: McCain just blamed the current Afghanistan mess on the 1980s Afghan war with Russia. Who was president during the Afghan war, your boy Reagan.
9:15 CT: McCain just made the leap from "I was joking with a veteran about bombing Iran" to "I know how to handle these crises."
9:21 CT: What is Russia going to do us? The USA has bigger issues at the moment.
9:22 CT: "Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia," Barack Obama on Russia.
9:23 CT: "Maybe," the biggest moment in the debate. McCain failed to take a stance, Obama did as well, but he talked through the question instead of entirely dodging the question.
9:25 CT: Nothing in the question about Israel asked by Terry Shirey had anything to do with Nuclear weapons.
9:33 CT: Senator McCain invokes an indirect use of the POW card. "When times are tough we need a steady hand on the tiller." Interesting farming reference to conclude the debate.
Secunia firm issued its annual report on vulnerabilities exploited in 2014 in most popular software, a document which includes key figures and facts.
Secunia has recently released its annual study of trends in software vulnerabilities, an interesting report that highlights the impact of the presence of flaws in common software and provide useful details on the way bad actors exploited it. According data provided by the Security firm Secunia, the number of Web browser vulnerabilities and zero-day exploited by hackers worldwide in 2014 is increased in a significant way.
Despite the prompt response of the security community and software vendors, which were able to early identify the threat and provide the necessary patch. Secunia revealed that more than 83 percent of 15,435 vulnerabilities present in 3,870 applications was fixed by vendors when a flaw was publicly disclosed, a positive trend that reveals a marked improvement compared to the past.
“The absolute number of vulnerabilities detected was 15,435, discovered in 3,870 applications from 500 vendors. The number shows a 55% increase in the five year trend, and a 18% increase from 2013 to 2014. Since 2013, the number of vendors behind the vulnerable products has decreased by 11% and the amount of vulnerable products has increased by 22%.” states the report published by Secunia.
The number of Zero-day flaws exploited by threat actors worldwide stepped up from 14 in 2013 to 25 in 2015, a significant increase that worries security experts because the exploitation of this type of vulnerabilities resets the effectiveness of the main defense systems. Another concerning data is the number vulnerabilities affecting Web browser software that increased to 1,035 in 2014, up from 728 the prior year.
The study confirmed the efficiency of the research community that succeeded into addressing the vulnerability limiting the exposure of users to the exploitation of the flaw.
“The most likely explanation is that researchers are continuing to coordinate their vulnerability reports with vendors and their vulnerability programs, resulting in immediate availability of patches for the majority of cases,” continues the report.
By analyzing data related to patch management, the experts discovered that if a patch wasn't available on the day a flaw was publicly disclosed, the time for its release lengthens, the percentage of products that had a patch ready a month after a flaw was disclosed only rose to 84.3 percent.
“30 days after day of disclosure, 84.3% of vulnerabilities have a patch available, indicating that if a patch is not available on the first day, the vendor does not prioritize patching the vulnerability” reads Secunia.
Very interesting a detailed analysis of the exploitation of PDF reader software which is a very common attack method due to its diffusion. According to data presented in the report the number of vulnerabilities discovered in Adobe Reader in 2014 is 43.
The report also analyzed the vulnerabilities discovered in open-source software that represented a serious security issue last year, we all have in mind the effects of the disclosure of the Heartbleed flaw. The use of open source applications and libraries is widespread, in the majority of cases they are bundled in a variety of commercial products and solutions, for this reason it must be carefully addressed.
“Organizations should not presume to be able to predict which vendors are dependable and quick to react when vulnerabilities are discovered in products bundled with open-source libraries,” Secunia said.
Let me suggest reading the report, I'm sure you will find it interesting.

One observer of the ongoing debate over police brutality remains quizzical about the evolving public narrative, particularly the White House role. “If only President Obama would look in a mirror. He's calling for an investigation into Ferguson and similar incidents, but he should ask himself how he could create trust and transparency when it comes to his own behavior in the White House. Of course, he never asks himself such questions,” declares talk radio host Michael Savage.
“Instead, Obama talks about working with street agitators to come up with solutions, instead of with ordinary American people. Obama also said he was worried about how much military equipment is being handed down to the nation's police forces. Now let's say your husband or your father is a policeman who is working in a community where the gang bangers have AK-47s and other assault weapons. What are they supposed to do? Go out on patrol naked? The police need this kind of equipment in these kinds of communities,” Mr. Savage concludes.
The American public, meanwhile, remains uneasy. Melancholy new public opinion numbers reveal that 53 percent of Americans say race relations have “gotten worse” under the Obama administration according to a Bloomberg Politics survey released Sunday; 45 percent of blacks and 56 percent of whites agree. Another 36 percent say things have stayed the same; an almost identical number of blacks and white agree. Nine percent overall say race relations have gotten better; 15 percent of black and 7 percent of whites agree.
LIMBAUGH PONDERS FERGUSON
Another talk radio host has also entered the debate in a rare TV crossover: Rush Limbaugh appeared on “Fox News Sunday” to assess Ferguson-related protests around the nation and the toll of politicizing the events. “There is grievance politics that is tearing the country apart. It is literally tearing the fabric of the country apart,” he told moderator Chris Wallace.
“This is not good for the country, what's happening here, because it isn't, I don't think, full-fledged legitimate. It's not based on real-world grievance. It's grievance that's being amplified and made up. The president could do a lot to spot this by telling people to trust the criminal justice system.” Mr. Limbaugh said, adding, “We have people to whom the truth is relevant and they're tying to redefine the truth for their own political agenda — and the president taking sides in this in a way that further divides the country, I find reprehensible and very unfortunate, too.”

STILL WATCHING THE BORDER
“Despite all the budgetary pressure impacting vital programs of importance to the American people, the Obama administration apparently feels there's still plenty of money to go around for illegal aliens,” says Judicial Watch director Tom Fitton, who reports that the Obama administration paid Texas-based Baptist Children and Family Services $182,129,786 to provide “basic shelter care” to 2,400 “unaccompanied alien children” at two U.S. military facilities for four months this year. The watchdog group obtained Department of Health and Human Services documents through Freedom of Information Act request. The Baptist organization describes itself as a global coalition of nonprofits.
“As we have previously reported, there has long been ample evidence the Obama Administration was operating in anticipation of a surge in illegal aliens that it, in fact, clearly instigated,” Mr. Fitton notes. The start date of this contract was October 1, 2013 — eight months before the youngsters began arriving.
“The project's end date of September 30, 2016, suggests that the Obama administration anticipates that the deluge will continue until near the end of his presidency,” he says, also noting that the generous funding provided for pregnancy test kits, 500 laptops and hotel accommodations for 822 “staffers” at a cost of $6.8 million in taxpayer funds.
THE CASSIDY PRESS
The midterms-weary press still had a thing or two to say about Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy's defeat of incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in a runoff election in Louisiana on Saturday. The moment gave journalists a chance to bandy about words like trounced, sank, crushed and obliterated with abandon — and a few observations in the last 24 hours:
“Dems' final insult: Landrieu crushed” (Politico), “Landrieu's loss a harsh milestone for Southern Democrats” (Time), “Mary Landrieu swept away by a red tide” (CNN), “Pro-Life Bill Cassidy Defeats Pro-Abortion Senator Mary Landrieu in Louisiana” (LifeNews.com), “Mary Landrieu defeat widens party, racial divide in the South” (Christian Science Monitor), “Mary Landrieu's closing message: Bill Cassidy will be subpoenaed” (Bloomberg News), “Republicans tie Landrieu loss to Hillary” (The Hill).
‘W' CUTS TO THE CHASE
Now No. 1, and leading the New York Times best-selling list for non-fiction: “41: A Portrait of My Father” by George W. Bush, recalling his dad H.W. Bush with candor and affection, producing an unprecedented look at father-son presidents. The Times reviewed the book in less than glowing terms, noting that the author “does not reflect on his lifetime of effort to prove himself by following in his father's footsteps, nor does he dwell on any frustrations in trying to measure up. With the former president fading into winter, the younger Bush's book feels like a release of sorts, finally getting rid of whatever baggage has been there for so long. A sunset at the hospital bed at last coming to terms.”
And the younger Mr. Bush's comment on same: “I think it's a typical psychobabble of somebody who has no clue what he's talking about,” he told CNN on Sunday.
THE EBOLA GUY'S GOING TO WHAT?
You remember the Obama administration's “Ebola czar” who appeared with much fanfare in October. Yes, of course. He is already preparing to go bye-bye, according to Fortune magazine. “With the Ebola crisis seemingly in hand, Ron Klain, the veteran political operative the White House plucked from a venture capital gig to coordinate the government's response, is planning a late-winter return to the private sector,” says Fortune analyst Tory Newmyer. “Klain has committed to former AOL chief Steve Case that by March 1, he'll be back on the job as president of Case Holdings and general counsel for Case's venture firm Revolution LLC.”
Oh. OK.
“It's as if he was just brought in as a distraction,” points out Glenn Reynolds, the “Instapundit” for PJ Media. “But hey, it worked. I would be interested, though, in seeing a report of what he actually did in his six-week tenure.”

Investment banks and brokers working on AIB's upcoming flotation have secured enough demand to cover the maximum 28.8 per cent stake the Government plans to sell in the coming weeks, according to market sources.
A spokesman for the Department of Finance said the fact that the order book has been covered is “in line with expectations and shows that there's good investor interest” in the deal.
Crucially, the initial orders fall within the range of between €3.90 to €4.90 per share that the Government announced as the expected initial public offering price range on Monday evening.
However, the ultimate success of the IPO, due to price around June 23rd, will depend on the extent to which the share sale has been oversubscribed and the type of investors it attracts. AIB's chief executive Bernard Byrne has set his sights on mainly attracting fund managers with a long-term perspective, rather than hedge funds, who might be willing to pay more but would only have a short-term interest in the bank.
The deal is being led by Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Davy, with Goodbody Stockbrokers, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS also on the team.
Shares plunged
Meanwhile, shares in AIB plunged by more than 28 per cent on the junior market in Dublin on Tuesday morning as investors digested the expected price range. By late trading, the drop had reduced, but shares were still almost 14 per cent lower at €5.60.
Many small, speculative investors had ignored repeated warnings from the Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in recent few years that AIB's stock – of which only 0.2 per cent remained tradable after the State seized the bank in 2010 – had been overvalued amid thin trading volumes.
While the shares spiked late last month at €9.20, the Department of Finance revealed on Monday that it sees €4.90 per share as the top of its likely IPO range. This implies a value of between €10.6 billion and €13.2 billion for the bank.
The overvaluation of AIB first emerged in August 2011 when investors ignored a surge in the number of shares in issuance as taxpayers pumped the final amount of a total €20.8 billion rescue of the bank during the crisis.
At one stage, the bank was notionally Europe's fifth-largest bank by market value, at over €60 billion, even as it was posting record losses. That was equivalent to nearly the State's entire €64 billion bill for saving the banking system during the crisis and the €67.5 billion international credit line the Government was forced to accept in 2010 .
Fatah, the political faction of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned Israel for killing three Palestinians who killed Israeli police officer Hadas Malka and injured four others in a stabbing and shooting terror attack in Jerusalem on Friday.
In a statement, Fatah called the deaths of the three assailants, who attacked at two locations near Jerusalem's Old City, a “war crime.”
Hamas said all three of the assailants were members of Palestinian terrorist organizations.

Fatah “condemns the war crime carried out by Israeli occupation forces in Jerusalem against three Palestinian teens,” spokesperson Osama al- Kawasme said in a statement. Fatah added that “the international community's silence emboldened Israel to further spill the blood of Palestinians.”
The three West Bankers, armed with an automatic weapon and knives, carried out near simultaneous attacks at two adjacent locations. Two attacked a group of police officers at Zedekiah's Cave with an automatic weapon and knives, and a third stabbed Malka a short distance away at Damascus Gate.
The 23-year-old staff sergeant died of her wounds at Hadassah Hospital in Mount Scopus. Four other people were lightly and moderately injured in the attack — including a policeman and two East Jerusalem Palestinians. Some reports said the gun used by the attackers jammed, preventing further casualties.
The attackers were identified by the Shin Bet internal security agency as Bra'a Saleh Atta and Usama Atta, both born in 1998, and Adel Ankush, born the following year. They were shot dead by security forces as they carried out their attacks.
The three were from Deir Abu-Mashal, a village near Ramallah. All had previously been arrested for or involved in terrorist activity, a Shin Bet statement said. Security forces late Friday night surrounded Deir Abu-Mash'al, and were preparing to raid the assailants' homes to question their family members regarding the attack.
Hamas, the terrorist organization that rules the Gaza Strip, also condemned the shooting of the three attackers as a “crime by the occupation.”
A spokesman for the movement, Hazem Qassem, said the attack was “proof that the Palestinian people are leading a revolution against the enemy.”
He also said the attack showed that the Palestinian Authority's policy of security coordination with Israel was wrong, calling it “a national crime.”
Hamas dismissed a claim of responsibility for the attack by Islamic State, and said all three assailants were members of Palestinian terrorist organizations. The attack was carried out by “two Palestinians from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and a third from Hamas,” Hamas said early Saturday.
In the wake of the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revoked the entry permits given to Palestinians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan to visit their relatives in Israel.
Israel had eased restrictions on the entrance of Palestinians from the West Bank for Ramadan, including permitting daily family visits during Sundays through Thursdays.
Netanyahu canceled the family visits at the recommendation of Chief of Police Roni Alsheich and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, according to a police statement.
Netanyahu, however, did not revoke the permission given to Palestinian men aged over 40 from the West Bank to enter Jerusalem for Friday prayers, police said.
Israel last month announced that it was relaxing restrictions on the movement of Palestinians to and from the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, including easier access to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, issuing more travel permits and allowing some to travel abroad. The measures were similar to those of previous years.
Over the past 18 months the Old City, and the Damascus Gate in particular, have seen several attacks by Palestinians, and in one case a Jordanian national.
Since September 2015, some 43 Israelis, two visiting Americans, an Eritrean national, a Palestinian man and a British student have been killed in stabbing, shooting and vehicular attacks by Palestinian assailants. In that time, more than 270 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, a majority of them attackers, according to authorities.
Israel has blamed the violence and terrorism on incitement by Palestinian political and religious leaders compounded on social media sites that glorify violence and encourage attacks.
The next generation of boys may play with Yoga Joes instead of G.I. Joes, thanks to a designer determined to spread the word that yoga is for guys, too.
The next generation of boys may be playing with Yoga Joes instead of G.I. Joes, thanks to a 31-year-old designer determined to spread the word that yoga is for guys, too.
Yoga Joes, the latest brainchild from Dan Abramson, the founder of "yoga for dudes" line Brogamats, are miniature figurines that look a lot like the green guys many of us know from childhood except in "om-azing" poses like Headstand, Cobra Pose, Warrior I, Warrior II, Child's Pose, Tree Pose, Crow Pose, Downward-Facing Dog, and Seated Meditation. The Joes recently debuted at museum stores including the SFMOMA Museum Store, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago Store, the Denver Art Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), after launching on Kickstarter last October. They're also available on the Yoga Joes website ($25 for a box of 9).

The Evolution of G.I. Joe Into Yoga Joe
“My hope is that boys, the next generation of men, view yoga differently after playing with Yoga Joes. That was the point of the project--to be inclusive--to let people know that yoga is for them, too,” says Abramson.
Not only are Yoga Joes intended to attract boys and men to yoga, they also pay homage to the veteran community. “The military community got really into Yoga Joes,” says Abramson. “Messages poured in from armies all over the world from people in the military that have found benefits in yoga, and wanted to convince others to do the same. Some just want to help out their fellow veterans."

The Joes even made it all the way to Afghanistan a couple of weeks ago with the help of Connected Warriors, a non-profit that bring yoga to soldiers. “It was so cool, and such a natural partnership, because the Yoga Joes project was designed to convince more people to try yoga, and there it was in pictures--the Yoga Joes getting soldiers to sign up for yoga class at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan,” says Abramson.

The Joes May Help Enlist Veterans In Regular Yoga Class
Annie Okerlin, founder of Yogani Studios in Tampa, Fla., and the Exalted Warrior Foundation, which facilitates an adaptive yoga instruction program for wounded warriors in military and veterans hospital facilities nationwide, says she has seen the veterans in her yoga classes discussing the Yoga Joes and using them to show veterans who are new to the class what they can expect to learn.
“Yoga Joes have been timely, as the conversation of yoga for veterans needs to be heard,” says Okerlin, who uses yoga to help veterans with PTSD and other ailments and injuries. “Yoga postures help bring the body into a greater state of comfort, particularly in cases of injury. The breathing used in yoga practice works the central nervous system. We teach tools to harness the breath for strength and focus and on the opposite end of the spectrum, to relieve anxious or stressed states.”

The Broad Reach of Yoga Joes
Abramson says he knew the yoga military community was big, but he had no idea how many lives he would touch with Yoga Joes. “I've received messages from families who are trying to reconcile life after service, and how yoga is helping them move forward together,” he says. “To have a product that can relate to them in any way is so much more than what I intended for when launching this project.”
And while Yoga Joes were never intended to preach a message against toys that some perceive as promoting violence, Abramson thinks it's good to have an alternative. “One mom emailed me that she was overjoyed that the Yoga Joes existed, because she doesn't allow violent toys in her house, especially soldiers, since her husband is deployed in Afghanistan. But the Yoga Joes allowed her to finally get the little green army men for her kids, because they celebrated soldiers for their focus and discipline.”

It's been a rather remarkable season by Seattle standards, but yesterday morning felt like a throwback to years past.
Here's how I'd sum up my past half-decade rooting for the Mariners. Each April, the baseball fan and Seattleite inside me gets all giddy about what this season could be for the M's. Then, usually by early-June, everyone but Felix has shit the bed, management tries solving the problem with Endy Chavez, and I'm left sending angry texts to friends about another year wasted. Come August, I'm checked out, watching games from my den of indifference. It's a cruel cycle, the reason I term the M's “the team [I've] always lamented loving.”
The 2014 trade deadline compressed this months-long process into a few short hours. I woke up, like any fan does on July 31, imagining all the new players the day might bring. At about noon came the bitterness; did the front office really think Chris fucking Denorfia was going to secure the first playoff spot we've had a chance at in years? And then, with 1:00 PDT mere minutes away, the resignation — yep, they did. Slanty face.
But right as I was prepping myself for an afternoon of sighing and shoulder shrugging and #smh'ing, the blessed news broke. David Price was being moved as part of a three-team trade. The Tigers and Mariners were involved. Seattle would receive center fielder Austin Jackson from Detroit.
Just like that, the deadline became a different type of microcosm: another day that exceeded expectations, in a season that's done nothing but.
The news shocked me, in part, merely because it came so late; it was, like, six minutes before the deadline when I first saw the tweets. Also because Jackson's was reportedly part of the deal, and by my count, he'd been mentioned in exactly zero trade rumors to that point. But in all that craziness, the thing that surprised me most was that Jack Zduriencik had pulled off a pretty damn good trade.
Despite having a down year in 2014, Jackson's a legitimate asset. He's been an above-average hitter for his career, can field the outfield's toughest position competently (though the defense has been trending downwards recently), and has been among the MLB's most valuable baserunners since his career began. Just two years ago, he was the league's fourth-best CF by WAR, and a top-20 position player overall by the same metric. Again, he hasn't been producing at quite that level since, but those are the numbers of an all-star.
Let's break down Jackson's current season. ZiPS has him slated to collect 2.2 WAR by year's end, which would be his worst campaign to date. What gives? Well, the hitting's been down a bit. He posted a 134wRC+ during that all-star season in 2012, and has run a 106 for his career, but that number has dropped a bit to 101 this year. I think most of that's explained by his power numbers, as his BB%, K%, and OBP are right around his career averages. Meanwhile, he's only projected to hit eight home runs this season, down from 12 last year and 16 the year before. Looking closer at those totals, though, is actually kind of encouraging. In 2014, Jackson's been hitting more fly balls than ever before, but for some reason, those balls are leaving the park at half the rate they have over his five years in the league. It'd be convenient to mark that up to diminishing strength, but keep in mind Jackson's only 27. That's the age when you expect players to fill out their bodies and start peaking offensively. So rather than see Jackson's recent power outage as physical decline, I think it's safe to say a lot of it's due to poor luck — I'm guessing he's hit a lot of warning track flies this season. And that means we can reasonably expect an offensive rebound both down the stretch and in 2015.
One thing that's probably not coming back is the defensive prowess Jackson showed when he first emerged in the bigs. The center field expanse is best covered with speed, and players only get slower as they age. Evidence of this, his UZR and DRS have been in decline since 2011. (The declining speed also means Jackson's been legging out fewer infield hits, which is perhaps another contributor to the fall in offensive output.)
Another quick note on Jackson's wheels. Though he's almost certainly getting slower, he's continued to add value on the basepaths, and is on pace to steal the most bags he has since 2011. His legs don't have the spring they once did, but he's become smarter about utilizing them, I'm guessing.
Ultimately, what the M's got in Jackson is an everyday CF, and a good one at that. He's not going to return to his elite 2012 form, but, overall, he's also probably due to improve on this year's production. Oliver projects him as a +3.1-win player in 2015, and that feels just about right, hitting, defense, baserunning, and age considered.
So, great, Seattle acquired a talented player. Nice! That in itself would be reason for excitement, but, of course, transactions aren't quite so simple. There are a lot of things to look at when evaluating a trade, like how much was given up to get the new talent, how long the team will control the acquired player(s), whether or not the trade fills an area of need on the roster, where the team finds itself in the standings, and so on. Fortunately for the M's, on Thursday, all these considerations added up to a move that fans could look at approvingly.
To secure Jackson, Seattle sent Nick Franklin Tampa Bay's way. After doing absolutely nothing in a short stint with the big league club this season, and then subsequently struggling in Tacoma too, Franklin's trade value had dropped from where it was in late 2013. Still, he was a consensus top-100 prospect entering last season, and was a top-50 guy prior to that. And a young, power-hitting middle infielder is a very desirable piece for any team. The M's certainly didn't school the competition on this deal. But considering Jackson's contract and where Seattle is right now, as well as all the above talk about how good of a CF he is, paying the price of Franklin wasn't all the difficult to stomach.
Probably most importantly, Jackson will be controlled through the 2015 season. He's not merely a rental, and should the M's fail to grab the second Wild Card spot this year, Jackson will still be here to help come next April. Incoming talent is a lot more valuable when it can contribute to two separate shots at the postseason.
Swapping Franklin for Jackson was also the exact magnitude of move I think most fans were hoping to see. Mike and I discussed this in more length during yesterday's Email Exchange, but Seattle found itself in a bit of a predicament at this year's deadline. The team's facing its first realistic shot at the playoffs in forever, which I'm sure had the front office's “buy now” senses tingling. At the same time, though, the most the M's can hope for is a one-game playoff against the A's or Angels, with the chance to then advance to the ALDS, and a mere chance at a chance opportunity isn't worth selling the farm. Which Seattle didn't do! Franklin's a young stud, but he's not untouchable, and on top of that, he didn't have a future with this team after Cano came along. In acquiring Jackson, Z found a nice middle ground between going for it in 2014 and saving the in-house prospects for future postseason runs with better odds.
Lastly, it was oh so cool that the team got all of the above in a CF. The M's outfield has been atrocious this year, ranking 28th in the league in WAR. It'd been especially bad recently, with Michael Saunders's injury meaning frequent appearances by the Endy Chavez-James Jones circus. The mere addition of Jackson would help most teams. But for Seattle, where getting him means switching a sub-win player with a one-win player from here on out, he helps especially.
Getting a year and change of a good player, who plays a position the team desperately needed to improve, during a time when the organization finally had a chance to give its fans October ball, is a great move. Doing so at the price of Nick Franklin is, to me, a really great one. I'm not ready to give Z my full endorsement, and you can bet I still have my #FireJackZ tweets at the ready, but good on him for his dealings yesterday. What a relief it was to watch Thursday afternoon's game with that trade fresh on the mind. For once, hope wasn't followed by anger and apathy, but simply more hope. The cycle was broken, at least for a day.
And hey, who knows. If that cycle can be broken, who's to say the postseason drought can't?

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — A former Temple University All-American running back, who helped lead the Baltimore Ravens to a Super Bowl, was the victim of crime in Philadelphia, according to CBS 3 sources.
Those sources confirm that Bernard Pierce was robbed at gunpoint Sunday evening along the 7500 block of Haverford Avenue. His BMW was also stolen.
The car was later recovered and processed at the police garage for possible clues.
Pierce's mother, Tammy Pierce, spoke to Eyewitness News about the incident involving her son.
“First of all, I thank God that he's fine. I don't care whatever he lost — his car, whatever was in there. He's fine,” Pierce said. “I think he was targeted because people knew who he was, and that's sad.”
Pierce and a male companion, sources say, were shaken, but were not injured during the robbery.
Sources say a gunman jumped from a car while his accomplice remained behind the wheel and robbed Pierce and his companion, then stole the vehicle.
The car was recovered in another part of the city and taken to the police garage, where it was carefully processed for any possible evidence that might lead to a suspect.
Pierce, who is from Ardmore, was visiting his family. His mother said he had only been in town a week, and that he'd purchased the BMW two weeks ago. She also said that he's now nervous and concerned for his safety.
Pierce was drafted by the Ravens last year, and this past February, they won the Super Bowl.
The Ravens organization, responding to a CBS 3 inquiry, emailed a statement that reads: “We have been in contact with Bernard and we are aware of the situation.”
Pierce's agent did not respond to requests for comment.
For now, Philadelphia police are saying only that they are hoping anyone with information that will help them catch the robbers will come forward.
His mother is just grateful her son wasn't harmed.
“”It could have turned out to be whole different ball game. He's good, he's healthy.”
An infrared/optical representative-color image of a massive galaxy cluster located 7 billion light-years from Earth. This cluster weighs as much as 800 trillion suns. Galaxies with "old" stellar populations, like modern-day ellipticals, are circled in yellow; galaxies with "young" stellar populations, like modern-day spirals, are circled in blue. Images taken with the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Mosaic-II camera on the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.
The most massive conglomeration of galaxies ever spotted inthe early universe has been found, astronomers say.
This behemoth galaxy cluster contains about 800 trillion sunspacked inside hundreds of galaxies. And it's not even finished growing.
The newfound cluster, called SPT-CL J0546-5345, is about 7billion light-years from Earth, meaning that its light has taken that long toreach us. Thus, astronomers are seeing this clump as it was 7 billion yearsago.
By now, it likely will have quadrupled in size, researcherssaid. The universe is about 13.7 billion years old. [Photo of the new galaxycluster]
"This galaxycluster wins the heavyweight title," astronomer Mark Brodwin of the Harvard-SmithsonianCenter for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., said in a statement. "It'samong the most massive clusters ever found at this distance."
While there are some heavier clusters in the near universe,if we could see this cluster as it is today, it would likely rank among themost massive clusters of all, the researchers said.
Brodwin and colleagues reported the discovery in a recent editionof the Astrophysical Journal.
Dark energy
The discovery could help scientists piece together the earlyhistory of our universe, as well as how strange stuff called darkenergy played a role.
Seven billion years ago, our solar system ? which is about4.5 billion years old ? was not yet born. This cluster must have formedrelatively soon after the Big Bang to have amassed such a girth so early,scientists said.
"This cluster is full of 'old' galaxies, meaning thatit had to come together very early in the universe's history ? within the first2 billion years," Brodwin said.
These days, new galaxy clusters cannot form because of theuniverse's accelerating rate of expansion ? each galaxy is flying apart fromall others at ever-increasing speeds. This is thought to be caused by amysterious force scientists have named dark energy.
Scientists think dark energy is behind the universe'smysteriously accelerating expansion, but they can't establish for sure thatthis force exists.
Weighing massive clusters like SPT-CL J0546-5345 could helpastrophysicists ?pin down the nature of this odd quantity.
South Pole vision
The galaxy cluster was spotted by a new, huge 33-foot(10-meter) telescope at the South Pole, where the observatory benefits from an exceptionallyclear, dry and stable atmosphere that enables extremely crisp high-resolutionphotos.
The so-called SouthPole Telescope, funded by the National Science Foundation and run byscientists at more than a dozen international institutions, is finishing up itsfirst survey of a huge swath of the sky in relatively long-wavelength,low-frequency submillimeter light.
Once the survey is complete, the researchers hope to findmany more previously unknown giant galaxy clusters.
"After many years of effort, these early successes arevery exciting," Brodwin said. "The full SPT survey, to be completednext year, will rewrite the book on the most massive clusters in the earlyuniverse."
About
I originally started this project from my home. In a household of five I didn't really have a whole lot of time to have my hands free. This lead to a lot of instances where I would drop and sometimes even break my cellphone. I spent a lot of time wondering if there was a better way to keep my phone in my hand and accessible I struggled with a lot of different designs including a tether design which only really seemed to cause more problems than it solved. One day when I was coming home from work I noticed a pile of old gloves sitting under the microwave stand in my kitchen and then I thought to myself wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to attach the glove to the back of the phone so I could see the phone while doing something else with that same hand? I began working on the project immediately. This was the birth of the first prototype known as the cell glove.
Risks and challenges The main challenges that we've had to overcome with this project were getting the initial funding for the project to get it of the ground. There are still a few problems with the initial design and the overall functionality of the glove don't quite meet the standards that I would like them too. I've worked with a few different marketing and design companies but living with a large family the fee's put an unusually high strain on our already stretched budget. We've worked hard to get as far as we've come but there's still a lot of work to do. Were hoping that with support we can see the project come into the light and get it into the hands of our supporters as early as possible. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
Lang told them how he wanted to hold the music festival to prove to “The Man” his generation was “not all just hippies.”
Osinski says he has always felt a connection with that era. He likes the music, the cars, the fashion of the day.
He got his musical influence from his parents, who immigrated from Poland in the late 1980s.
“From a young age I was introduced to Led Zeppelin and then I kind of ventured my way into the other artists like CCR, Jimi Hendrix, the Eagles,” he says. It was better than the current music he heard on the radio.
“I always thought I was the only one who still believes in that music and listens to that music from my age, from the millennials,” he says.
That music inspired him to pick up a guitar. His band will provide music for the documentary.
Osinski only learned about Woodstock 10 years ago and has been somewhat fascinated with it ever since. He says he's amazed at how the three-day show in upstate New York attracted half a million people from across the continent virtually by word of mouth alone, compared to today when it would be driven by social media. Historically, it stands alone.
“Everyone says there's nothing like what happened at Woodstock,” he says. “You can create Coachella, you can create Amnesia Rockfest, you can create the Solaris … you can't create another Woodstock. That name alone drives people to want to go back there.”
Osinski's final product will be 15 to 30 minutes long. He hopes to hold a première for “Let's Go Back to Woodstock” in late April and, if it is popular enough, he plans to recut the footage and release it on the film festival circuit. See facebook.com/letsgowoodstock for details.

The destroyer USS Fitzgerald pulls alongside amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard as it transits the Pacific Ocean.
YOKOTA AIR BASE, Japan — Tributes are flowing for seven Navy sailors who lost their lives when the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off Japan Saturday morning.
The scale of the tragedy was revealed in news reports from hometowns all across America.
In Ohio, the Chronicle-Telegram newspaper focused on Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Leo Rehm Jr., 37, who'd followed his World War II veteran grandfather into the Navy in 1998. The Elyria, Ohio, native was three months short of retirement when he lost his life, the newspaper reported.
Daniel Kahle, of Chespeake, Va., who deployed with Rehm on the USS Ponce to the Persian Gulf during Operation Iraqi Freedom, told the newspaper that his shipmate was “one of those guys that always had a smile on his face.”
“The way I feel right now is shocked,” his cousin, Brad Rehm, told the newspaper.
Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, of Chula Vista, Calif., enlisted in the Navy soon after graduating from high school, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.
“There was never a time that Carlos wasn't making people laugh,” Chase Cornils, a fellow cadet in Chaparral High School's Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, told the newspaper. “He always had a cheerful attitude and a smile on his face. When I think of Carlos, I can only remember an extremely happy guy who was willing to help all of his friends.”
Sibayan felt like the Navy was his calling, Cornils told the newspaper.
“I knew he was extremely excited to join and start his career in the Navy and serve our country,” he said. “He wanted to start as soon as he could.”
Gunner's Mate Seaman Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19, from Palmyra, Va., was a volunteer firefighter with the Lake Monticello Fire Department and a graduate of Fluvanna County High School, according to ABC 8 television news.
Classmates of Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, of Oceanside, Calif., who attended Kubasaki High School on Okinawa, remembered him as a class clown who raised spirits on the tennis team.
Lan Thi Huynh, 23, the sister of Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc “Tan” Truong Huynh, 25, of Oakville, Conn., told the Hartford Courant that her brother enlisted in 2014 because he wanted to give back to his mother who raised four children alone. The accident happened on her brother's 25th birthday, she said.
“It's not something he always wanted to do, but he wanted to do something adventurous,” she said.
“We will always remember him in our hearts as the most selfless person, quiet yet had the brightest smile,” she said. “I just want everyone to know that he was the best brother ever, and the sweetest human being that I knew.”
Darrold Martin, father of Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin, of Halethorpe, Md., told Maryland news station WJZ-TV that the loss was hard.
“He's my only child,” Martin said. “He's all I have.”
His aunt, Daneace Jeffery told Baltimore FOX45 news station that Martin, a graduate of Lansdowne High School who joined the Navy five years ago, “was a wonderful man who loved his job.”
A cousin of Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez, of Weslaco, Texas, told CBS Dallas-Fort Worth that pictures of her cousin always kept them together.
“We lived through his experiences. His travels. We were just proud that our boy was up there,” Aly Hernandez-Singer said.
“We all came from poverty in Guatemala,” Hernandez-Singer said. “He was the one who made it. And we were so proud of him.”

Not since we screamed at “Carrie” has America seen such a prom horror story.
It all starts like young love in the fair city of Shelton, Conn. The Connecticut Post reports that James Tate asked Sonali Rodrigues to the prom this way:
Tate and two friends went to the high school campus in the middle of the night and posted 12-inch tall, cardboard letters on the outside of the building — at the main entrance. The message that many saw when they arrived to school Friday, read: “Sonali Rodrigues, Will you go to prom with me? HMU Tate.”
She said yes, of course. But the school without a heart said no. Tate and his fellow letter posters were given in-house suspensions and banned from the prom.
The story of young love has created a buzz across the country. The story was featured on Drudge, the AOL homepage and Gawker. And now there's a follow story in the Post.
Supporters have rallied in Facebook. Town officials have questioned the punishment. Said one:
Seventy-seven years ago this week, my grandmother left her fourth-floor apartment in Munich carrying a painting by Otto Stein, a modestly popular German artist. Earlier that month, the Nazis had launched a nationwide pogrom against Germany's Jewish minority, a rampage in which gangs of men burned stores, schools and synagogues. In the aftermath of what became known as Kristallnacht, the Gestapo rounded up hundreds of Jewish men and sent them to the Dachau concentration camp. Among them was my grandfather, Jakob Engelberg.
Paula Engelberg never talked about what happened during her visit to the Swiss consulate. But when she returned home a few hours later, she no longer had the painting. What she had was the most precious of commodities in Nazi Germany of 1938: A valid visa to enter Switzerland.
The consulate issued only 600 such documents that year, up from just 200 the previous year. This particular one secured the release of my grandfather from Dachau after two weeks, allowing my grandparents, father and aunt to escape Germany and ultimately settle in the United States. It made possible the existence of 20 more human beings.
I'm one of them.
Five years ago, I told this story to Christian Salewski, a German journalist who was working at ProPublica for several months as part of a fellowship. I said I had always wondered what had happened to the painting, not because it was particularly valuable — works by Stein can be found on eBay selling for a few hundred dollars — but because I wanted to know its story.
As a journalist, I imagined any number of possible narratives. Perhaps the painting was given to a diplomat who dispensed visas to desperate Jews, a Schindler of the Swiss diplomatic service. Perhaps it had been sold to an art dealer to raise the money for a bribe. Maybe it was simply a gratuity for a service rendered.
I had fantasies of finding a house full of paintings in Switzerland, the owners unaware of the lives saved by their existence.
I told Christian that we had only one real clue. My family had managed to leave Germany with a second painting by Stein, a portrait of a young woman whose gaze seems to follow you, Mona Lisa-like, across a room. In my father's memory, this painting, which he called “My Mona Lisa,” bore a striking resemblance to its missing sister in both style and subject. The remaining painting hung in our family's living room, a testament to our past as refugees.
Early this year, Christian and three colleagues decided to launch what they called #kunstjagdt — “art hunt.” Their plan was to spend six weeks using social media like WhatsApp and stories on the radio, on television and in newspapers to search for the artistic equivalent of a needle in a very large hay stack.
Their reporting unfolded against the backdrop of the exploding refugee crisis in Europe and the Middle East. It was not hard to see parallels.
Then, as now, a desperate group of people sought to escape an increasingly terrifying situation. Then, as now, most countries in the world turned their backs. It's sometimes suggested that German Jews of the 1930's were a delusional group, waiting far too long to flee a country in which they had grown too comfortable. The truth as documented by the Art Hunt team is that then, as now, there was hardly anywhere to go.

Jakob Engelberg applied to emigrate to the United States in 1934, shortly after Hitler came to power. He waited four years for his number to be called in America's restrictive, Depression-era immigration system. My aunt told me years later that people who applied for U.S. visas just a few weeks later in 1934 died in the Holocaust.
My father and his sister recall that Hitler's speeches and the Nazi Party's program persuaded Jakob Engelberg that the Jews of Germany faced an existential threat, one sufficiently dire to persuade him to abandon a comfortable middle-class life as a traveling salesman living in one of Europe's most beautiful cities.
The records dug up by the Art Hunt team suggest he was trying to live his life as an ordinary German. According to a Gestapo report Christian found in the Munich archives, Jakob Engelberg “read the rather liberal Frankfurter Zeitung but besides that was quite an apolitical person who didn't show party flagging from his window on national holidays.”
I never got the chance to ask him precisely what persuaded him to try to leave Germany at such an early date. Jakob Engelberg died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1941, long before I was born. (The German government would eventually make a small payment in compensation for his death, acknowledging that it was caused, at least in part, by blows to the head he received while at Dachau.)
The U.S. visas for Paula Engelberg and the two children, Melly and Edward, arrived in October 1938. Jakob's visa was delayed because of his Polish nationality, a less-desirable category of immigrant under U.S. law for which fewer visas were issued. And so he was imprisoned in the barracks of Dachau on Nov. 10, 1938, a Jew still waiting for his papers to leave the country.
These facts were confirmed by records recovered from archives in Germany and Switzerland by Christian and his Art Hunt colleagues: Fredy Gareis, Marcus Pfeil and Carolyn Braun.
The search for the painting proved much more difficult. The team identified the man who stamped the precious visa: Wolfgang Gribi, a Swiss diplomat whose wife lived to be over 100. Unfortunately, she died two years ago.
They tracked down an expert on the art of Otto Stein who helped them identify 14 possible “suspects” that were similar to my family's Mona Lisa. Most could be eliminated by date or provenance and my father eliminated several more in a Skype conversation (his first, at age 86). Eventually, the team narrowed it down to one particular painting that was bought by a private collector in Munich in 1950 after suffering what was described as “war damage.”
Christian flew to the United States and showed the painting to my father.
Not surprisingly, he could not be certain. It had, after all, been 77 years since he had seen the missing painting. Still, he said it touched him in ways that none of the other possibilities had.
There remained a piece of evidence that seemed to undermine the case for this particular painting. My father's memory of what happened in November, 1938, confirmed on many other key points, was that his mother had rolled up the painting before leaving for the Swiss consulate. Yet the newly discovered painting is on stiff paper that could not have been rolled.
Jakob Engelberg's Swiss visa, dated Nov. 24, 1938.
As a journalist, of course, I'm familiar with the vagaries of human memory. To be fair, if my father's recollection is accurate, the painting turned up by the Art Hunt cannot be The One. But it is also possible that the traumatic events of those days left my father with a memory that is inaccurate in this one regard. In all likelihood, we will never know.
On Friday, my wife and youngest daughter flew with me to Munich to watch the premiere of a movie that tracks the four journalists on the Art Hunt. The story was as much about a new generation of Germans looking unblinkingly at the past as it is about a long-lost piece of art. The movie was shown at the Jewish Museum of Munich as part of an exhibition of both paintings.
In the question-and-answer session that followed the showing, there was a surprise: The Art Hunt team announced that the owner of the Stein painting had decided to give it to our family. Although he had bought it long after the war, and the identification is far from confirmed, Christian told me he didn't feel right having it in his collection if there was any possibility it had been traded for a visa.
Jakob Engelberg's Swiss visa was dated Nov. 24, 1938 — that year's Thanksgiving. He was released from Dachau the next day and was out of Germany by early December. Weeks later, my father, then 10, began his life as a refugee, living with a distant relative in Lakewood, New Jersey. He was enrolled in public school and tried to learn in a language he spoke not at all.
As American presidential politics echo with calls for registries of Muslims and governors say they won't accept Syrians whose circumstances are similar to my Dad's, I know what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving. The two paintings are hanging at the Jewish Museum of Munich, side by side. In a few weeks, they will be returned to my father.
Years ago I met a young Amazonian shaman, or spiritual leader, on his first visit to London. As we went down the escalator into the London Underground I could see he was nervous. All these white people rushing around under the city must be spirits or ghosts, he said. When we emerged, he was himself nearly white, shaken from his cosmological introduction to Britain.
That man was Davi Kopenawa Yanomami, who has since been dubbed the Dalai Lama of the Rainforest and is considered one of the most influential tribal leaders in Brazil. The Yanomami number about 30,000 and occupy a vast territory stretching across northern Brazil and southern Venezuela. They only made full contact with the west in the 1950s when their lands were overrun by thousands of gold prospectors and loggers. After waves of epidemics and cultural and environmental devastation, one in three of all Yanomami, including Davi's mother, died.
Davi's experience of white people has been dreadful but he is unusual because he trained not just as a shaman but also worked with the Brazilian government as a guide and learned western languages. In the past 25 years, he has travelled widely to represent indigenous peoples in meetings and, having lived in both societies, he has a unique viewpoint of western culture. With the help of an anthropologist, Bruce Albert, who interviewed him over several years, he has written his autobiography. It is not just an insight into what a Yanomami leader really thinks, but a devastating critique of how the west lives, showing the gulf between primordial forest and modern city world views.
Here, taken from his autobiography and conversations at Survival International's offices in London, are some of his observations of the rich north and its attitudes to consumerism, cities, wealth and nature.
On England
In this distant place, the wind does not blow without a reason and the rain does not fall by itself. But the beings of darkness and chaos are closer there. It is very cold. The night lasts a long time. The spirits in this ancient white people's land are truly numerous. I was seized by such dizziness. Their ancestors did not take care of the forest in which they came into being the way ours did.

On western wealth
Their cities are full of big houses and innumerable possessions but their elders never give them to anyone. If they were really great men, should they not tell themselves that it would be wise to distribute them all before they make so many more? Do we ever hear the white people say: “Take all the machetes and pots that you see?” We people of the forest possess few things and we are satisfied. They are used to greedily hoarding their goods and keeping them locked up. They probably tell themselves: “I possess all these things alone. I am so clever, I am an important man. I am rich!”
On shopping
Their thoughts are constantly attached to their merchandise. They relentlessly and always desire new goods. I fear their euphoria of merchandise will have no end and they will entangle themselves to the point of chaos. They do not seem concerned that they are making us all perish with the epidemic of fumes that escape from all these things. They do not think that they are spoiling the earth and the sky, and that they will never be able to recreate new ones.
On New York
Multitudes of people here move very fast and in every direction, like ants. They look at the ground all the time and never see the sky. Yet while the houses in the centre of the city are tall and beautiful, those on its edges are in ruins. The people there have no food and their clothes are dirty and torn. They looked at me with sad eyes. These white men are greedy and do not take care of those among them who have nothing. How can they think they are so smart? They do not want to know anything about these needy people. They reject them, and let them suffer alone. They are happy to keep their distance and call them “the poor”. They even take their crumbling houses from them and force them to camp outside in the rain with their children. It scared me to see such a thing.
These white men are greedy and do not take care of those among them who have nothing
On western cities
Their cities are beautiful to see, but the bustle of their inhabitants is frightening. People there live piled up one on top of another and squeezed side by side, as frenzied as wasps in the nest. It makes you dizzy and obscures your thought. I can never think calmly in the city. People constantly ask you for money for everything, even to drink and urinate. Everywhere you go you find a multitude of people rushing, although you do not know why. Whenever I stay there too long I become restless and cannot dream.
On global warming
The white people's thought is full of ignorance. They constantly devastate the land they live on and transform the waters they drink into quagmires! There is only one sky and we must take care of it, for if it becomes sick, everything will come to an end.

On war
White people reproach the Yanomami for arrowing each other, but they are the ones who really wage war. I watched them on television fighting each other for oil with their aeroplanes in a land with no trees. We do not fight with the same hardness as they do. If one of our people is killed by arrows or sorcery blowpipes we only respond by trying to kill the enemy who ate him. This is different from the wars with which the white people mistreat each other. They fight in great numbers. They even kill their women and children. They simply make the wars for bad talk, to grab new land for minerals, to tear minerals out of the land.
On work
White people are greedy and make people suffer at work, to extend their cities and accumulate merchandise there. This merchandise is like a fiancee to them. They are really in love with it. They go to sleep thinking about it like we doze off with the nostalgia of a beautiful woman. They dream of their car, their house, their money. Merchandise makes them euphoric.
On politics
I have often travelled to the white people to defend our forests and I know a little of what they call politics. It really made me become more suspicious. Their politics is nothing but mixed-up talk, the words of people who try to deceive.
Their politics is nothing but mixed-up talk, the words of people who try to deceive
On drink
They drink beer and, having become ghosts, face off like chickens or starving dogs until they have killed each other. They do it out of jealousy or for gold and do not lament their dead but abandon them. We only go to war to avenge ourselves out of anger for the mourning we feel.
On illness
The white people work in a ghost state and constantly swallow the wind of factory and machine fumes. The [fumes] go into their noses, their mouth and their eyes, and stick to their hair. This is why white people are so sick. Their doctors may open their chests, stomach or eyes but it does not help them. The sperm of fathers whose flesh is tainted by this epidemic smoke become sick and their children are born in bad shape.
On the environment
When they speak about the forest, white people often use the word “environment”. What they refer to in this way is what remains of everything they have destroyed so far. I don't like this word. The Earth cannot be split apart as if the forest were just a leftover part. With leftover trees and leftover rivers, leftover game, fish and humans who live there, its breath of life will become too short. That is why we are worried. We shamans simply say we are protecting nature as a whole thing. We defend the forests' trees, mountains and rivers, its fish, game, spirits and human inhabitants. We even defend the land of the white people beyond it and all who live there.

On conversation
You have to press together to understand each other when you speak. The roar of the machines and motors stands in the way of all the other sounds. The babble of televisions covers all other voices. White people are always worried. Their thoughts become scattered, seized with dizziness. This is how you become stupid.
On destruction
The white people want to kill everything. They will soil the rivers and lakes and finally take what is left. They won't leave anything alive. They think we are not human beings and they all hate us. We also have a mouth and eyes, blood and bones, we are all hungry and thirsty, too. We all have the same fold behind our knees so we can walk! But where do the white people get this fierce desire to destroy the forest and its inhabitants?
On ageing
The lives of white people who hurry like ants seem sad to me. They are always impatient and anxious. They barely sleep, and run all day in a daze. They live without joy and busy themselves with acquiring new merchandise, their minds empty. Once their hair is white they disappear and the work – which never dies – survives them without end. Then their children continue to do the same thing.

An AirBnB host who cancelled an Asian woman's reservation based off racial discrimination has been ordered to pay $5,000 in damages for her remarks according to the Guardian. She will also be required to complete a course on Asian-American studies.
The host, Tami Baker, had rented out her mountain cabin in Big Bear on the popular vacation rental site, AirBnB.com. Back in February, Dyne Suh, a 26-year-old law clerk, had booked the cabin for a weekend ski trip with her fiancé, two friends, and two dogs. Baker had agreed to the party's use of her cabin, charging them $300 per night.
After driving several hours through inclement weather conditions, Suh texted Baker to let her know they were nearly there and to confirm the cost. Baker then denied ever agreeing to let the extra guests stay (despite the screenshots of the agreement) and responded with racist remarks.
“Go ahead. I wouldn't rent to u if u were the last person on earth.”
“One word says it all. Asian.”
After Baker refused to let them into the cabin, Suh and her group made a viral video discussing the racist incident.
They also reported Baker to AirBnB, who promptly removed her from their platform.
“We have worked to provide the guest with our full support and in line with our non-discrimination policy, this host has been permanently removed from the Airbnb platform,” Airbnb representative Christopher Nulty said.
Suh went further, opening up an investigation with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). The DFEH and AirBnB had previously come to a landmark agreement that forced AirBnB to screen their hosts for racial bias and punish those that had unfairly discriminated against customers. Baker was the first host to be investigated and subsequently penalized for failing to comply with the agreement and federal discrimination laws.
Baker's full punishment includes paying Suh $5,000 in damages, completing a college-level course on Asian-American studies, make a personal apology to Suh, follow all anti-discrimination laws, participate in a community education panel, and volunteer with a civil-rights organization.
“We were thinking pretty creatively with this agreement,” said Kevin Kish, director of DFEH. “The law tends to be backwards-looking, focusing on compensating people for harm. We're interested in remedies that repair harm and transform relationships.”
“A lot of times when we see bias incidents it involves a lack of understanding of the experiences and histories of a particular group of people. This was a creative way to address that core underlying cause of the bias.”
Baker's attorney, Edward Lee, issued the following statement regarding the conclusion of the investigation:
“[My client is] regretful for her impetuous actions and comments [but pleased to have resolved the matter with Suh and the DFEH] in a manner that can hopefully bring a positive outcome out of an unfortunate incident.”
Suh left this comment on her FaceBook page in light of the verdict:
“Press statement regarding the outcome of the Running Springs/Big Bear airbnb incident:
I am very glad that the outcome of this case includes taking an Asian American studies course. I believe that the more people learn about and understand our history and our struggles, the more they can feel empathy towards us and treat us as equals.
I hope that more victims of discrimination will feel encouraged to come forward with their own stories, empowered now with the knowledge that government entities such as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and other civil rights organizations will take our cases seriously and fight vigorously for us in order to protect our civil rights. Your pain is not insignificant and you are not alone.
Asian Americans are often left out of conversations about race relations, even though we are also targets of racism and discrimination. The more we speak out, the harder it becomes for people to ignore, deny, or trivialize our lived experiences of being discriminated against like this day-to-day.
If we want racism and discrimination to end, we cannot keep suffering in silence, and we cannot stand idly by when it is happening to other people of color and other oppressed minority groups. We are in this together. <3 ✊”
HOLLYWOOD (CBSLA.com) — Unlike one of his signature cameo appearances, Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee was the star of the show Tuesday when he sank his hands and feet into cement at the TCL Chinese Theatre.
Lee, 94, was just honored last week as a Disney Legend for his role in the creation of 90 percent of Marvel Comics' iconic characters, including Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men, and Iron Man.
Filmmaker Kevin Smith and comic-book artist Todd McFarlane were among those on hand at the Chinese Theatre and sang the praises of Lee, who was characteristically humble.
“If I'd have known I was so good I would have asked for a raise,” Lee said, joking that he is apparently “far too good to be wasting time with ordinary people.”
“But I seem to be spending my life with ordinary people who are the best people in the world,” he said. “I've been the luckiest man in the world because I've had friends. And to have the right friends is everything. People
you can depend on. People who tell you the truth if you ask for something. I've been lucky in that area.”
Born Stanley Martin Lieber on Dec. 28, 1922, in New York City, Lee began his career in 1939 as an assistant at Timely Comics with such duties as getting lunch, filling inkwells and proofreading.
His first published work was as a text filler for Captain America No. 3, published in 1941. He wrote under the name Stan Lee, which would later become his legal name, writing in his autobiography that he intended to save his given name for more literary work.
Lee was named interim editor of Timely Comics in 1941, and later became the editor-in-chief for what would evolve into Marvel Comics in 1961 until 1972 when he became publisher.
More than 2 million of Lee's comic books have been published in 75 nations and in 25 languages. His characters have been featured in 24 animated television series and several live-action blockbuster films.
Lee's wife of nearly 70 years, Joan, died July 6 at age 93.

“The economic crisis of 2008 gave us new life,” said Billy Wharton, a co-chairman of the Socialist Party, who grew enamored of socialism while battling tuition increases as a student at the College of Staten Island. “We have ideas for resolving the economic crisis, and people began to listen to them.”

Rather than trumpeting membership numbers, the parties, embracing the norms of the digital era, prefer to discuss the number of hits on their Web sites and Facebook pages. And philosophically, they take a kind of I-told-you-so schadenfreude in statistics that indicate a growing gap between the rich and the poor, with top chief executives now making 275 times as much as the average proletarian.
Still, it is hard to imagine that the parties have inherited a revolutionary tradition once so popular that in the 1932 presidential election, Norman Thomas, the Socialist candidate, garnered 884,000 votes and William Z. Foster, the Communist candidate, had over 100,000. But then again, after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the collapse of socialist republics in Eastern Europe, some people may be surprised to learn that these parties are still around.
All three have greatly shrunk from their heydays. The Socialist Party has about 1,000 members nationally. The Communists claim 2,000. The Democratic Socialists, which for many years included luminaries like Michael Harrington and Irving Howe, have about 6,000.
“It's not easy to make political progress outside the two-party structure because people don't want to waste their votes,” said Frank Llewellyn, 62, the national director of the Democratic Socialists, who became a socialist as a result of the civil rights and antiwar movements.
Rather than battling for power through elections, all three parties try to sway the national conversation through coalitions with labor unions and other mainstream organizations. Both socialist groups turned out at City Hall this month to protest budget cuts, at a rally that was largely organized by the unions.
But on matters of principle, the leftist parties diverge. All three oppose President Obama's health care program, seeing it as a giveaway to insurance companies and preferring either a single-payer government plan or a socialized system like that of Britain, where doctors work for the government.

The Socialists sometimes do have candidates who run in states where the rules for getting on the ballot are not too onerous; Greg Pason, the national secretary, ran for governor of New Jersey in 2009. But the Democratic Socialists see that effort as futile and prefer endorsements; they supported David N. Dinkins and Ruth W. Messinger in their mayoral bids in New York City.

The parties' enduring character is obvious in visits to their offices. The Socialist Party is housed in a tumbledown building on Lafayette Street known informally as the “Peace Pentagon” or the A. J. Muste building, not because the name approximates its mildewed atmosphere but because Mr. Muste was a benefactor of the peace groups that the building houses. The Democratic Socialists even have a foothold on Wall Street, with cluttered offices in a building on Maiden Lane. It is not because Wall Street has suddenly adopted a philosophy of “to each according to his own needs.”
“It's cheap,” Mr. Llewellyn explained. “This is an area of the city where you get the best deals.”
The Communists even own the means of production — they lease out their eight-story building on West 23rd Street to other left-wing organizations. The party has the most decorous space, having redesigned its office with glass walls and tall windows.

“We're not up to some nefarious business we have to hide from the American government,” said Libero Della Piana, 38, the party's communications director.
Physical space matters less these days than virtual space. All three groups have lively Web sites that flaunt their philosophies and histories. Mr. Della Piana, the child of an Italian anarchist, boasts that the Communists' news site has 25,000 unique visitors a week; before it stopped publishing in the late 1960s, its newspaper, The Daily Worker, was read by just 5,000 subscribers. In 2010, he said, 700 prospective members applied through the Web site.
Recent disclosures of capitalist excesses have given the parties a second wind after the collapse of the Soviet Union suggested the bankruptcy of collectivist philosophy. Mr. Llewellyn said that since 2007 his party's membership had increased by 50 percent, to 6,000.
“People see the consequences of unregulated markets, greed, a lack of checks on the power of the private flow of capital to drive the economy and undermine jobs,” Mr. Llewellyn said.

Mr. Webb, who joined the Communists in the 1970s, likes to emphasize the party's rich history, including the fight against McCarthyism and the volunteers who helped the Spanish Republicans battle the Fascists, rather than more unpleasant episodes like the case of the American Communist Julius Rosenberg, who spied for the Soviet Union.

Mr. Della Piana says the Soviet Union's dissolution freed the party to be more ideological because “no one could ever say again we were puppets.”
“We have a whole generation of young people attracted to the idea of communism without the baggage of the cold war,” he said.
After declining to 250 members in 1980, the Socialist Party's membership has quadrupled, Mr. Wharton said. He was even asked to appear on a Fox affiliate when conservatives raised suspicions that Mr. Obama was a socialist.
“They thought I'd go on and on and actually support the policies of President Obama,” said Mr. Wharton, 42, a General Educational Development, or G.E.D., teacher in Brooklyn. “The question was ‘Is he a socialist?' and my answer was ‘I'm not sure he's even a liberal.' I called him a hedge-fund Democrat.”
None of the parties view their existence as futile — immersing themselves in everyday local battles, they believe, will spread their influence.
“Socialism won't come to this country until tens of millions decide capitalism doesn't work for them,” Mr. Webb said. “If you're a revolutionary, if you're a socialist, you have to have patience.”

Congress returns this week in hopes of quickly completing the year's remaining work, but the dash to the finish could create headaches in the early part of Donald Trump's presidency, particularly when it comes to the debate over government spending.
Lawmakers are expected to spend the coming week working to pass a short-term spending bill, the annual defense policy measure and a sweeping biomedical research and drug approval package. They also hope to wrap up work on a water infrastructure bill that includes money to help address the water crisis in Flint, Mich.
Republican leaders are eager to wrap up their work and head home for the year, but many of the bills on the agenda have the potential to force the GOP to renegotiate policies within a few months when a new Congress and president are in office.
Perhaps the biggest issue for Republicans early next year will be deciding a spending plan for 2017. House and Senate leaders are negotiating the final details of a stopgap spending bill to keep the government open past the current Dec. 9 deadline. There is no real question that Congress will avert a government shutdown, but leaders are still debating how long into next year it should keep the government funded so that the new Congress and Trump can hammer out a final spending deal for the 2017 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
House leaders announced before Thanksgiving that Trump and his team had asked Congress to prepare a spending bill that would keep the government open at current spending levels through the end of March. That measure would allow Trump to quickly put his own stamp on government spending. But Senate leaders worried that it would be difficult early next year to write a new spending bill while simultaneously working to vet and approve Trump's Cabinet appointments and some of the party's top legislative priorities.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Thursday that he and other House leaders took those concerns into account and are working on drafting a spending bill that would go beyond March.
“We're working with Leader McConnell on their calendar to make sure that we can accommodate some of their, you know, concerns, which I think are legitimate because they have different responsibilities than the House does,” Ryan said.
Ryan refused to specify just how long the spending bill would last, but many lawmakers with knowledge of the talks guessed it would go until the end of April or May. While that may give Trump a greater cushion, it could also lead to an ugly spending fight in the spring.
Senate Democrats next year could seek to block a spending package if it provides less funding for programs they support, and House conservatives could balk if they feel the overall funding number is too big. Both scenarios could be a headache for the new Trump administration.
The possibility of such a fight has some in the GOP warning it's a mistake to kick this year's spending decisions into the next administration.
“This is bad for the military; it's bad for every agency of the government,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said of the short-term bill. “I think it's a bad decision, and I think all concerned will live to regret it.”
Still, the stopgap spending bill is expected to be cleared this week, and much of the focus now is on efforts to persuade leaders to add special provisions to the legislation. One of the more controversial items is a policy rider backed by the Obama administration that would allow the embattled Export-Import Bank to operate at full capacity for the first time in more than a year. Some Republicans in Congress have refused to approve new members to fill three open positions on the agency's five-member board of directors.
The bank provides financing for American companies looking to conduct business overseas, and some conservatives deride its mission as “crony capitalism.” It cannot vote to allow new loans worth more than $10 million unless at least one of the open positions is filled. Democrats are working with some friendly Republicans to drop the measure that requires a three-member quorum, a move that conservatives strongly oppose.
“I think if they get included, it would be a major debate,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Thursday.
If the Export-Import rules are changed, Trump can expect in the spring to relitigate the fight over the bank while also attempting to hash out spending priorities — essentially repeating the same battles that plague lawmakers today.
Leaders also hope to finish work on the Water Resources Development Act, an environment and water infrastructure bill that includes aid for the Flint water crisis and a controversial “Buy American” provision.
The House and Senate passed separate versions of water projects legislation earlier this year, and negotiators are working to hammer out any final differences, including whether the bill will include a measure to require the government to purchase American-made steel for any upcoming infrastructure projects.
Some Republicans want funding for the “Buy American” language stripped from the bill, putting them directly at odds with Trump, who backed the concept at a rally in last week.
“Whether it's producing steel, building cars or curing disease, we want the next generation of innovation and production to happen right here in America and right here in Ohio, right?” Trump said Thursday in Cincinnati.
The Senate is also set to vote on the only bill expected to remain relatively untouched by a future Trump administration. The 21st Century Cures bill, which passed the House last week, aims to streamline the approval of new drugs, improve mental health care and provide money for medical research, including $1.8 billion for Vice President Biden's cancer moonshot initiative. The legislation has faced some opposition on the left, but it is expected to easily be approved early this week.
In the realm of foreign policy and defense, the main question before Congress is whether lawmakers later this month will have to override a pair of potential presidential vetoes.
The Senate is expected to pass the $618.7 billion annual defense policy bill this week. The House passed the measure on Friday by a vote of 375 to 34. But the White House has not yet indicated whether the president would sign the bill.
While the legislation steered clear of several policy changes the Obama administration opposes, it did not fully resolve a dispute over spending. The bill relies on an extra $3.2 billion in war funds, which is more than lawmakers agreed to in a two-year budget deal struck last year, to pay for Pentagon programs and military operations.
War funds are not subject to budget caps and can be used as a way to provide extra money for the Pentagon without running up against the spending restrictions known as sequestration. But the White House has strongly resisted such budgeting moves. Last year, Obama vetoed Congress's first attempt to pass a defense policy bill due to his opposition to how Congress was tapping the war-funding account.
Obama is also sitting on a House- and Senate-approved bill to extend the Iran Sanctions Act for 10 years — legislation that lawmakers believe is vital to maintain the threat that the United States will retaliate against Iran if it violates the terms of a nuclear deal struck last year.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has warned that the sanctions extension would violate the United States' obligation under the nuclear pact and is urging Obama to veto the bill. The Obama administration has resisted efforts to pass the extension, arguing that the president already has ample authority to punish Iran for violations of the nuclear pact and other aggressive moves, such as a recent spate of ballistic missile launches.

For mutton in the traditional sense, see lamb and mutton
Raw goat meat
Goat meat or goat's meat is the meat of the domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus).
Goat meat from adults is often called chevon and cabrito, capretto, or kid when it is from young animals. While "goat" is usually the name for the meat found in common parlance, producers and marketers may prefer to use the French-derived word chevon (from chèvre), since market research in the United States suggests that "chevon" is more palatable to consumers than "goat meat".[1] Cabrito, a word of Spanish and Portuguese origin, refers specifically to young, milk-fed goat. In some parts of Asia, particularly India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, the word "mutton" is sometimes used to describe both goat and sheep meat, despite its more specific meaning, limited to the meat of adult sheep, in the UK, US, Australia and other English-speaking countries.[2][3]
In cuisine [ edit ]
Goat is both a staple and a delicacy in world's cuisines. [4] The cuisines best known for their use of goat include African cuisine, Middle Eastern, North African, Indian, Indonesian, Nepali, Pakistani, Mexican, and Caribbean (Haiti).[5] Cabrito, or baby goat, is very typical food of Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico;[6] in Italy it is called capretto.
Goat has historically been less commonplace in American, Canadian and Northern European cuisines but has become more popular in some niche markets,[7] including those that serve immigrants from Asia and Africa who prefer goat to other meat.[8] As of 2011 the number of goats slaughtered in the United States has doubled every 10 years for three decades, rising to nearly one million annually.[9] While in the past goat meat in the West was confined to ethnic markets, it can now be found in a few upscale restaurants and purveyors,[4] especially in cities such as New York and San Francisco.[5] Brady, Texas has held its Annual World Championship BBQ Goat Cook-Off annually since 1973.[10]
Roasted kid
Goat meat is savory and less sweet than beef[9] but slightly sweeter than lamb. It can be prepared in a variety of ways, such as being stewed, curried, baked, grilled, barbecued, minced, canned, fried, or made into sausage. Goat jerky is also another popular variety. In Okinawa (Japan), goat meat is served raw in thin slices as yagisashi. On the Indian subcontinent, the rice dish mutton biryani uses goat meat as a primary ingredient to produce a rich taste. "Curry goat" is a common traditional Indo-Caribbean dish. In Bangladesh, traditional meat dishes like kosha mangsho and rezala are prepared using meat from a "Khashi", a castrated goat with meat that has richer taste and a milder, less gamey flavour. In Indonesia, goat meat is popularly skewered and grilled as sate kambing, or curried in soups such as sup kambing and gulai kambing.
Goat meat is also a major delicacy in Nepal, and both castrated (Khashi-ko-masu) and uncastrated (Boka-ko-masu) goats are sacrificed during Dashain, the largest annual celebrations in the country, as well as on other festive occasions. There are many separate dishes, which together include all edible parts of the animal. Bhutun is made from the gut, Rakhti from the blood, Karji-marji from the liver and lungs, and the feet — Khutti — are often made into soup. Sukuti is a kind of jerky, while Sekuwa is made from roasted meat and often eaten with alcoholic beverages. In addition to these dishes, goat meat is often eaten as part of momos, thukpa, chow mein and other dishes in various parts of the country. Taas is another popular fried goat meat dish in Nepal, particularly popular in Chitwan district of Nepal.
Cabrito, a specialty especially common in Latin American cuisine such as Mexican, Peruvian, Brazilian, and Argentine, is usually slow roasted. In Mexican cuisine, there are a variety of dishes including Fritada (cooking the goat in its blood) and cabrito entomatado which means it is boiled in a tomato and spices sauce. Southern Italian, Greek and Portuguese cuisines are also known for serving roast goat in celebration of Easter (in Italian cuisines, minced goat is used in spaghetti bolognese and lasagna as an alternative for beef), with the North of Portugal serving it as well on Christmas day;[5] goat dishes are also an Easter staple in the alpine regions of central Europe, often braised (Bavaria) or breaded and fried (Tyrol).
In Africa, the Chaga people of Tanzania, a ceremonial goat (locally called Ndafu) would be gutted and roasted as whole as part of tradition that spans hundreds of years. The ceremonial goat is the preferred replacement to the wedding cake used in many weddings around the world.
Characteristics [ edit ]
Goat has a reputation for having a strong, gamey flavour, but the taste can also be mild, depending on how it is raised and prepared.[4] Caribbean cultures often prefer meat from mature goats, which tends to be more pungent; while some other cultures prefer meat that comes from younger goats that are six to nine months old. Ribs, loins, and tenderloin goat meat are suitable for quick cooking, while other cuts are best for long braising.[9] Despite being classified as red meat, goat is leaner and contains less cholesterol, fat, and protein than both lamb and beef,[11] and less energy than beef or chicken;[9] therefore, it requires low-heat, slow cooking to preserve tenderness and moisture.
Production [ edit ]
Goats consume less forage than beef cattle. An acre of pasture can sustain 10 goats or more, compared to two steers. A goat may produce 40 pounds (18 kg) of meat, however, which is much less than from cattle or pigs, often making goats unsuitable for modern meat processors.[9]

Gender equality and female role models not making a positive difference, study finds
COLUMBIA, Mo. – Global studies have shown that women are underrepresented in some science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects and fields. Even in countries with higher gender equality, sex differences in math and technical scores persist. Now, using international data, a team of psychologists from the University of Missouri, the University of California-Irvine and the University of Glasgow in Scotland, have determined that, overall, girls experience negative emotions about mathematics that can result in avoidance of math topics. Often called “mathematics anxiety,” scientists believe that several factors other than math performance are resulting in higher mathematics anxiety in girls compared to boys.
“We analyzed student performance in 15-year-olds from around the world along with socio-economic indicators in more than 60 countries and economic regions, including the U.S. and the United Kingdom,” said David Geary, Curators Professor of Psychological Sciences in the MU College of Arts and Science. “Analysis revealed that girls' mathematics anxiety was not related to the level of their mothers' engagement in STEM careers; nor was it related to gender equality in the countries we studied. In fact, the gender difference in mathematics anxiety was larger in more gender-equal and developed countries. In more developed countries, boys' and girls' mathematics performance was higher and their mathematics anxiety was lower, but this pattern was stronger for boys than for girls.”
According to the study, in 59 percent of the countries analyzed, gender anxiety differences are more than twice the magnitude of gender differences in mathematics performance, indicating that factors other than performance are resulting in higher mathematics anxiety in girls than boys. Altogether, the study highlights the complexity of the gender differences in mathematics performance and anxiety, Geary said.
The study also analyzed the possible role of parental views on the value and importance of mathematics for their daughters and sons. In contrast with what many believe, parents in more developed countries placed a stronger emphasis on the mathematical development of their sons than their daughters — despite the fact that these more developed countries actually have larger proportions of mothers working in the STEM sector.
“Policies to attract more girls and women into subjects such as computer science, physics and engineering have largely failed,” said Gijsbert Stoet, reader in psychology at the University of Glasgow and a co-author of the study. “Gender equality is a key humanistic value in enlightened and developed societies, but our research shows that policymakers cannot rely on it as the sole factor in getting more girls into subjects like physics and computer science. It is fair to say that nobody knows what will actually attract more girls into these subjects. Policies and programs to change the gender balance in non-organic STEM subjects have just not worked.”
The study, “Countries with higher levels of gender equality show larger national sex differences in mathematics anxiety and relatively lower parental mathematics valuation for girls,” was published in PLOS ONE.

Dear Mayor Reed:
Nearly two years have passed since the Atlanta Police Department raid on the Atlanta Eagle, and we now ask you to fulfill your pledge to the LGBT community for a thorough investigation and swift action. The recently released internal OPS report and the independent Greenberg-Traurig report found indisputably that officers broke the law. This week, the Department of Justice cited the raid as an example of anti-gay police harassment. The city of Atlanta cannot tolerate officers who break the law, nor can its citizens have faith in a police department that condones unlawful behavior.
We are calling for all twenty-five officers who have been found to have violated the law during the Atlanta Eagle raid to be fired immediately. Furthermore, we are asking for these officers to be prosecuted for the crimes they committed against citizens they swore an oath to protect and serve.
It is our hope, Mayor Reed, that you will stand by your pledge for appropriate and swift action. The Atlanta LGBT community has faith that if you stand with us in seeking justice, what happened at the Atlanta Eagle will never happen again.
Sincerely,
The Queer Justice League
What do you think it the proper punishment for officers who violated the law during the raid? Should they be charged and tried in addition to be fired?

AMBRIDGE, Pa. — Amid rumors of potentially more tapes showing him making inappropriate comments in the past, Donald Trump issued a threat to rival Hillary Clinton, saying Monday that if he keeps getting attacked, he'll keep talking about the women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault and harassment.
In his first public rally since Sunday night's debate and last Friday's disclosure of a 2005 videotape showing him making shockingly lewd comments about women, the Republican presidential nominee defended his “inappropriate words” but insisted that Bill Clinton has treated women far worse. And he attacked Hillary Clinton for supposedly doing nothing to stop it.
“I was getting beaten up for 72 hours, on all of the networks, for inappropriate words 12 years ago, locker room talk, whatever you want to call it,” Trump said. “But I said to myself, ‘Wait a minute, I used inappropriate words, but Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women, and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously.' One of them said more viciously than he attacked.”
Rumors have swirled of other potentially damaging videos from his days as host of “The Apprentice” and other past interviews floating around. And Trump seemed to confirm there could be more shoes to drop and issued a threat to his critics. “They want to release more tapes [of me] saying inappropriate things, we'll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things,” the GOP nominee declared.
After weeks of threatening to go there, Trump invited as guests to Sunday's debate three of Bill Clinton's accusers — Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey — as well as Kathy Shelton, who was involved in a child rape case in which Hillary Clinton defended the accused attacker.

Trump suggested he'd done so because the media had never covered the women's stories, a claim that ignores decades of Bill Clinton's extramarital dalliances, including the president's relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment. Speaking to a few thousand supporters here in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, a swing region in battleground Pennsylvania, Trump presented himself as someone who could help get them media attention.
“It was both very beautiful and very sad. They have been trying to get their feelings out for so long, and the media wouldn't take it,” Trump said. “So last night I decided we would expose the hypocrisy of the Clintons and the media.”
The thrice-married businessman has been on the defensive about his treatment of women, including former Miss Universe Alicia Machado who said that Trump, as head of the pageant, publicly humiliated her when she gained weight. On Friday, a video emerged of Trump bragging in explicit terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women. The conversation was captured on an open microphone during a 2005 interview with “Access Hollywood,” and it included Trump boasting about his attempt to seduce a married woman and bragging that he could get away with “anything” with women because of his celebrity status.
Echoing the statements he made at Sunday's debate, Trump on Monday again offered a feeble apology, saying he regretted the words on the tape. But again he shifted the focus to Bill Clinton, whom he described as the “worst abuser of women” and “a predator.” And he cast Hillary Clinton in almost harsher terms, attacking her credibility on women's issues because she had supposedly “enabled” her husband's alleged behavior and attacked his accusers.
“For many decades, Hillary Clinton has been deeply familiar with her husband's predatory behavior and instead of trying to stop him, she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women,” Trump said. “She put even more women in harm's way, and then she goes out and says, ‘I love women.' … She's a total hypocrite.”
The latest renderings of the proposed Edgewater Beachwalk have been released by architects Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill. The beachwalk plans, based on the Virginia Beach Boardwalk in Virginia, will bring back the area's lakefront promenade, which was demolished in the early 1950s to make way for Lake Shore Drive. Smith & Gill Architects are also behind the upcoming building at Navy Pier's the Yard at Shakespeare Theatre.
The scope of the proposed project is to extend the lakefront park and bike path (which currently ends at Ardmore Avenue) to Devon Avenue. The plans include new beaches, a beach house, a docking area, a dog park and acres of new lakefront green space.
Edgewater Beachwalk Chicago Group , which is behind the beachwalk push, has been at work collecting signatures and trying to gain area support. The organization believes the project will not only make the lakefront more accessible to all residents, but will also create a beautiful, safe route for pedestrians and bicyclists between Ardmore and Devon.
Alderman Harry Osterman's office, though in support of the beach walk idea, told DNA info that the project is not a priority. He believes there is just not enough funding right now for such an ambitious project. Instead, the Alderman is diverting any available funds towards Chicago Public Schools, which are facing a significant budget crisis.
Edgewater Beachwalk Chicago Group will be holding upcoming events in support of the project:
• The first open house will be held at Berger Park on Wednesday, June 1, at 7 p.m. in the south mansion near Granville and Sheridan. Smith & Gill renderings will be unveiled for public and media inspection.
• At noon on Friday, June 3, at Berwyn and Sheridan (east sidewalk in front of The Breakers strip mall and Park Tower), the members will kick off a guided walking tour of the future lakefront project improvements from Berwyn Avenue to Rosemont Avenue.
• Ice cream social fundraiser at the Anna Held Fountain space at Edgewater Beach Apts. on Saturday, June 25, from 1 p.m. – 3 p.m. Cost $5.
Raytheon has received a $1.1m grant from the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to provide next-generation gallium nitride (GaN) technology for military radars.
The alliance plans to develop scalable, agile, multimode, front end technology (SAMFET) for the army's next-generation radar (NGR) programme.
The programme aims to improve radar-reliant air defence, counter rocket and mortar system performance, particularly in portable configurations such as hand-held, vehicle-mounted and airborne deployments.
"Our team will leverage Raytheon's deep investment and unmatched expertise as a pioneer in gallium nitride technology to dramatically improve radar capabilities."
Under the two-year cooperative research agreement, the partners will design and manufacture modular building blocks that can easily integrate with next-generation radar systems' open architecture.
Raytheon advanced technology vice-president Colin Whelan said: "Raytheon's storied track record of innovation in applied radar technologies uniquely positions us to play a critical role in the development of the US Army's next-generation radar system.
"With the (United States) Army Research Lab, our team will leverage Raytheon's deep investment and unmatched expertise as a pioneer in gallium nitride technology to dramatically improve radar capabilities and keep the army ahead of its adversaries for many years to come."
Raytheon's GaN is a semiconductor material that can efficiently amplify high-power signals at microwave frequencies.
It enables radars to operate up to five times more powerfully than they would with older semiconductor technology, without overheating.
The company's GaN components deliver higher power density and efficiency, and have demonstrated an average time between failures of 100 million hours.
The 90s child inside me, weaned on Q101 and Beavis and Butthead, had high hopes for this album: a stunning return from the only one of Seattle's big four to make a graceful exit with all its players intact. A completely different part of me — the grown-up, too-cool-for-school reviewer of SERIOUS INDEPENDENT MUSIC — was praying for a good faceplant, a flaming 10-car pileup that would make Chris Cornell's Scream seem like a good idea in retrospect. Neither corner of my being is walking away from King Animal feeling completely satisfied. The album is right at home with the rest of the Soundgarden catalog, as natural a progression from Down on the Upside as if it had been released in 1998 instead of 14 years later. Tragically, it feels no more necessary for that fact.
Soundgarden were always primo purveyors of heavy psychedelic rock, of metal filtered through a punk rock aesthetic. That wasn't so unusual for Seattle in the late 80s/early 90s, but Soundgarden had two things going that helped them stand out from the rest of their grunge-rock peers: a guitarist capable of weaving dense, complex riffs and a singer with a vocal range that seemed downright inhuman. King Animal puts both to good use. Cornell, in particular, sounds phenomenal here. Maybe there's some studio magic at work, but his ragged, tuneful wail sounds as fresh and precise as ever. “Non-state Actor” marks the most serendipitous combination of Soundgarden's virtues. The song chugs along on one of Kim Thayil's most kinetic riffs, and when Cornell rips into the chorus, dragging out into a gravelly animal howl for the final syllable of the line “a little bit more than everything,” it's hard not to just give yourself over to the moment and throw up the devil horns.
Nothing else even comes close to touching that, though, and it's difficult to determine exactly why. Everything sounds right, and all the pieces are seemingly in place, but the end product feels wholly insubstantial. Soundgarden's best material conjures a dense atmosphere of gloom that renders Cornell's angsty lyrics portentous and significant. But few of the songs on King Animal evoke much of anything in the way of feeling. Nothing here stacks up to a slow-burning conflagration like “Blow up the Outside World,” the metallic squall of “Jesus Christ Pose,” the apocalyptic drone of “Black Hole Sun,” or even the tender melancholy of deeper cuts like “Tighter & Tighter” or “Boot Camp.”
At least die-hard fans can take comfort in the fact that King Animal is a supremely listenable record. Except for the ballad “Halfway There” (the album's one truly cringe-worthy moment), the tunes are heavy and raw, and they bear a credible resemblance to the group's classic material. Still, I can't get past the feeling that I'm witnessing some unholy act of necromancy. The bodies move, they make sounds, and they remember everything that our loved ones experienced, but that which animates them is not life. If this is all that the reconstituted Soundgarden is capable of offering to the band's legacy, then I say the best thing to do is to crush this zombie's skull and lay those bones to rest.
BEIRUT, Lebanon — President Bashar al-Assad of Syria on Wednesday celebrated his overwhelming victory in a deeply disputed election, asserting his confidence and defiance in the Syrian conflict as supporters savored his success in thwarting the United States.
Syrian officials announced that Mr. Assad had been re-elected with 88.7 percent of the vote and reported turnout of 73.4 percent of eligible voters. Those numbers could be questioned on many levels, but that did not matter much, as the election was primarily a display of Mr. Assad's continued control of important Syrian cities, the loyalty of his core supporters and the failures of his opposition and its backers.
For United States officials, it was a less triumphant day. Mr. Assad's supporters celebrated with gunfire in Damascus and even in neighboring Lebanon, where Secretary of State John Kerry paid a visit on Wednesday. But the Americans were confronted with a sense that their policy on Syria and in the region was adrift.
The night before, Robert S. Ford, the career diplomat and Arabic speaker who was until recently the nominal ambassador to Syria and the main executor of American policy there, declared on “PBS NewsHour” that he quit his post in February because the policy had failed and he “could no longer defend” it in public. He said that with the United States unwilling to seriously aid potential allies in the Syrian opposition, Russia and Iran had been “driving” the war's dynamics by hugely increasing their support for Mr. Assad.
October 23, 2012 (Washington) — More than eight in ten Americans ages 16-29 read a book in the past year, and six in ten used their local public library. Many say they are reading more in the era of digital content, especially on their mobile phones and on computers.
These findings come from a new report from the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project that examines younger Americans' reading and library use habits during the rise of e-content. This research is part of a larger effort to assess the reading and library use habits of all Americans ages 16 and older and these findings will be reported at the Internet Librarian conference in Monterey, California.
According to a nationally representative poll by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project:
83% of Americans between the ages of 16 and 29 read a book in the past year. Some 75% read a print book, 19% read an e-book, and 11% listened to an audiobook.
Some 75% read a print book, 19% read an e-book, and 11% listened to an audiobook. Among Americans who read e-books, those under age 30 are more likely to read their e-books on a cell phone (41%) or computer (55%) than on an e-book reader such as a Kindle (23%) or tablet (16%).
than on an e-book reader such as a Kindle (23%) or tablet (16%). Overall, 47% of younger Americans read long-form e-content such as books, magazines or newspapers. E-content readers under age 30 are more likely than older e-content readers to say that they are reading more these days due to the availability of e-content (40% vs. 28%).
E-content readers under age 30 are more likely than older e-content readers to say that they are reading more these days due to the availability of e-content (40% vs. 28%). About half (48%) of readers under age 30 said they had purchased their most recently read book. Another 24% said they had borrowed it from a friend or family member, and 14% said they borrowed it from a library.
The report also examines younger Americans' library usage, and what e-book-related services they might be interested at their local libraries:
60% of Americans under age 30 used the library in the past year . Some 46% used the library for research, 38% borrowed books (print books, audiobooks, or e-books), and 23% borrowed newspapers, magazines, or journals.
. Some 46% used the library for research, 38% borrowed books (print books, audiobooks, or e-books), and 23% borrowed newspapers, magazines, or journals. High-school-aged readers were more likely to have borrowed the last book they read from the library (37%) than they are to have bought it (26%). This pattern soon reverses for older age groups—almost six in ten readers in their late twenties said they had purchased their last book.

Many young e-book readers do not know they can borrow an e-book from a library. Among those ages 16-29 who have not borrowed an e-book from the library, 52% said they were unaware they could do so.

A majority of non-borrowers under age 30 expressed an interest in doing so on pre-loaded e-readers. Some 58% of those under age 30 who do not currently borrow e-books from libraries say they would be “very” or “somewhat” likely to borrow pre-loaded e-readers if their library offered that service.
“High schoolers stand out in several ways. We found that libraries are a large part of how readers ages 16-17 get their books, more so than older adults. These high schoolers are more likely than other age groups to use the library, including for research and book-borrowing,” said Kathryn Zickuhr of the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project, a co-author of the report. “Yet their appreciation for these library services doesn't quite match up—almost half of 16-17 year-olds say that the library is not important or ‘not too important' to them and their family, significantly more than other age groups.”
The main findings in this report, including all statistics and quantitative data, are from a nationally-representative phone survey of 2,986 people ages 16 and older that was administered from November 16-December 21, 2011. This report also contains the voices and insights of an online panel of library patrons ages 16-29 who borrow e-books, fielded in the spring of 2012.

A new technique inspired by elegant pop-up books and origami will soon allow clones of robotic insects to be mass-produced by the sheet.
Devised by engineers at Harvard, the ingenious layering and folding process enables the rapid fabrication of not just microrobots, but a broad range of electromechanical devices.
In prototypes, 18 layers of carbon fiber, Kapton (a plastic film), titanium, brass, ceramic, and adhesive sheets have been laminated together in a complex, laser-cut design. The structure incorporates flexible hinges that allow the three-dimensional product -- just 2.4 millimeters tall -- to assemble in one movement, like a pop-up book.
The entire product is approximately the size of a U.S. quarter, and dozens of these microrobots could be fabricated in parallel on a single sheet.
"This takes what is a craft, an artisanal process, and transforms it for automated mass production," says Pratheev Sreetharan (A.B. '06, S.M. '10), who co-developed the technique with J. Peter Whitney. Both are doctoral candidates at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).
Sreetharan, Whitney, and their colleagues in the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory at SEAS have been working for years to build bio-inspired, bee-sized robots that can fly and behave autonomously as a colony. Appropriate materials, hardware, control systems, and fabrication techniques did not exist prior to the RoboBees project, so each must be invented, developed, and integrated by a diverse team of researchers.
Less than a year ago, the group was using a painstaking and error-prone method to fold, align, and secure each of the minuscule parts and joints.
"You'd take a very fine tungsten wire and dip it in a little bit of superglue," explains Sreetharan. "Then, with that tiny ball of glue, you'd go in under a microscope like an arthroscopic surgeon and try to stick it in the right place."
"Until recently, the manual assembly process wasthe state of the art in this field," Sreetharan adds.
By the numbers
Folding joints: 22
Assembly scaffold folding joints: 115
Total device folding joints: 137
Number of brass pads for "glue" points: 52
Total number of "glue" points: 24
Mass: 90 mg
By mass, one U.S. quarter = 63 Harvard Monolithic Bees
The same result can now be achieved -- without human error -- through locking mechanisms and dip soldering. The new process also enables the use of cured carbon fiber, which is rigid and easy to align, rather than uncured carbon fiber, which Sreetharan compares to "wet tissue paper."
"Our new techniques allow us to use any material including polymers, metals, ceramics, and composites," says principal investigator Rob Wood, an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at SEAS and a Core Faculty Member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard.
"The ability to incorporate any type and number of material layers, along with integrated electronics, means that we can generate full systems in any three-dimensional shape," Wood says. "We've also demonstrated that we can create self-assembling devices by including pre-stressed materials."
The implications of this novel fabrication strategy go far beyond these micro-air vehicles. The same mass-production technique could be used for high-power switching, optical systems, and other tightly integrated electromechanical devices that have parts on the scale of micrometers to centimeters.
Moreover, the layering process builds on the manufacturing process currently used to make printed circuit boards, which means that the tools for creating large sheets of pop-up devices are common and abundant. It also means that the integration of electrical components is a natural extension of the fabrication process -- particularly important for the size- and weight-constrained RoboBees project.
"In a larger device, you can take a robot leg, for example, open it up, and just bolt in circuit boards. We're so small that we don't get to do that. I can't put a structural mechanism in here and have it serve no electrical function."
Pointing to the carbon-fiber box truss that constitutes the pop-up bee's body frame, Sreetharan says, "Now, I can put chips all over that. I can build in sensors and control actuators."
Essentially, tiny robots can now be built by slightly bigger robots. Designing how all of the layers will fit together and fold, however, is still a very human task, requiring creativity and expertise. Standard computer-aided design (CAD) tools, typically intended for either flat, layered circuit boards or 3D objects, do not yet support devices that combine both.
Once the design is complete, though, fabrication can be fully automated, with accuracy and precision limited only by the machining tools and materials.
"The alignment is now better than we can currently measure," says Sreetharan. "I've verified it to better than 5 microns everywhere, and we've gone from a 15% yield to -- well, I don't think I've ever had a failure."
The full fabrication process will be described in the March issue of the Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering. Co-authors and collaborators, beside Whitney, Sreetharan, and Wood, include Kevin Ma, a graduate student at SEAS; and Marc Strauss, a research assistant in Wood's lab.
The work was supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, the National Science Foundation (through the Expeditions in Computing program), and the Wyss Institute.
Eden Abergil, former Israel government militant, proudly posted pictures with bound and blindfolded prisoners to her Facebook profile. She is defending her pride and went so far to say she would “gladly kill Arabs—even slaughter them”, adding: “In war there are no rules.”
Yousef Munayyer, executive director at The Jerusalem Fund & The Palestine Center, debated this is much bigger issue of racism and dehumanization with Richard Hellman, president at the Middle East Research Center on “The Alonya Show” at RT where host Alonya Minkovski goes a bit fair, asking if this is Israel's Abu Ghraib. The images were extraordinarily graphic from Abu Ghraib, but more importantly, more people paid attention to it, yet not enough. Her point that the “dehumanization” aspect is striking and goes to the root of the problem (8:41):
A former militant of the Israel Defence Forces (I.D.F.) is defending her actions after the discovery that she posted photos in her Facebook album, “I.D.F.—the best time of my life,” of her posing with kidnapped Palestinians imprisoned by the Israeli government.
She “allegedly” went further on her Facebook page, Thursday, that she “would gladly kill Arabs—even slaughter them”, Ha'aretz reported today, adding:
“In war there are no rules,” Abergil allegedly wrote on the wall of her profile page on the social network Facebook. Photographs uploaded by Abergil from Ashdod and labeled “IDF – the best time of my life,” depicted her smiling next to Palestinian prisoners with their hands bound and their eyes covered. A comment attached to one of the photos of the soldier smiling in front of two blindfold men and posted by one of Abergil's friends read “That looks really sexy for you,” with Abergil's response reading: “I wonder if he is on Facebook too—I'll have to tag him in the photo.”
The deeper issue is her actions displaying the sectarian interpretation of her faith. That extending principles of how women ought to be treated, or just humans in general, don't apply to Arabs:
Abergil responded on Facebook to an image in which a woman were pasted instead of the Palestinian prisoners in the original images, saying that it was not funny and that she would not let anyone ruin her “perfect life.” “I can't allow Arab lovers to ruin the perfect life I lead,” she allegedly wrote. “I am not sorry and I don't regret it.” “I am in favor of a Jewish-Zionist State,” she added. “I defend what has been rightfully mine for ages,” she wrote.
The faith of many others serves as a perceived self-justified ignorance to bullshit of “rightfully mine for ages”. An “age” is an arbitrary length of time, but the Zionist philosophy is rooted in the strict sense of multi-generational entitlement to land. In it's most vulgar and common interpretation, that such entitlement is not only inherited from ancestors centuries ago, but from the will of the entity that they believe created humans, animals, Earth and the universe itself. In practice, human action reflects the implication that 13.7 billion years ago, the universe came to existence for the purpose of some conscious lifeform to inhabit a portion of one landmass existing in a relatively insignificant portion of the universe.
Because of this, actions to the end of fulfilling the ‘prophecy' are predetermined and justified by the power available to achieve those conquering ends. The nihilism of Zionism is one such a stage that it's astounding that adherents sustain the fairy tales. To which Ha'aretz added:
The head of the Public Committee Against Torture, Ishai Menuchin, also commented, saying that “these terrible photographs reflect a norm in the way Palestinians are viewed, as an object and not as humans. It is an attitude that ignores their feelings as humans and their individual rights.”
I was raised by Muslims, but haven't attended a worship service since my early teenage years and would consider myself a deist, I guess. My name might invoke the knee-jerk reaction to brush me off as taking a sectarian stance. To those enemies of reason, extremists in the Islamic world are equally guilty in their ‘hallowed ground' stances on Mecca, Medina and even Jerusalem.
I'd rather Zionists just act more like the average Russian, Canadian or Pakistani in terms of the geopolitics of the nation-state they inhabit and just be ardent nationalists without dressing their evil voodoo in the will of an otherwise loving and awesome god.
Nationalism is an evil categorical imperative used to justify why people are “not sorry” and “don't regret” evil, anti-social behavior and mindsets, but nationalism accepts that such evil is the result of conscious human action and subjective preferences. These are foolishly referred to as, at least, ‘necessary evils'.
Faith-based politics is the doctrine that what is necessary is incapable of being evil because the will of their god is, by definition, always good. Hence, “In war, there are no rules,” because Ms. Abergil is speaking of a ‘holy war', no matter what window dressing I.D.F. spokespeople splatter on the wall to cover up the writing.

EY, in cooperation with GreenBiz Group, conducted a survey in late 2011 consisting of executives and thought leaders in corporate environmental strategy and performance.
For this report, we analyzed the results from 272 sustainability executives in 24 industry sectors who are employed by companies generating revenue greater than $1 billion.
Exploring developments in corporate sustainability programs, the report shows that:
76 percent of survey respondents anticipate natural resource shortages will affect their core business objectives over the next 3-5 years.
65 percent of respondents stated their CFO has become involved in sustainability.
Our survey covered a wide range of topics related to corporate sustainability and reporting, and the results show that interest in these areas continues to rise (although the tools are still developing). CFOs are emerging as key players in sustainability. And employees are too: they are second only to customers as drivers of company sustainability initiatives.
Despite the decreasing likelihood of regulation to address climate change — at least in the United States — greenhouse gas reporting and reduction efforts remain strong, and interest in water usage, efficiency and stewardship is on the rise.
Also rising is stakeholder interest in the sustainable sourcing and availability of raw materials intrinsic to a company's ability to operate. And sustainability-focused surveys and questionnaires from customers, NGOs, investor groups, analysts, media organizations and others continue to grow in importance.
These trends suggest that sustainability efforts are now well-integrated into the corporate fabric of a growing number of large and midsized companies.
But the effectiveness of such efforts may be limited by internal systems that don't allow companies to effectively measure, track and optimize their sustainability impacts, or to understand and manage the risks of insufficient action. To do so will require new levels of engagement by the C-suite, and more sophisticated methods of sustainability reporting and assurance.
From this comprehensive survey, there are additional statistics that illuminate six key trends:

The intricate folds of origami are infinitely useful across science, from designing safer airbags to building more resilient architecture. Here, though, the same principles are being applied to a self-assembling robot that uses a tiny microcontroller to transform itself from 2D to 3D, then walks away.
Harvard's microrobotics engineers Sam Felton and Robert Wood were inspired by the concept of "rigid origami"—the same folding techniques as origami but made sturdier with structural-grade materials and hinges—in creating the autonomous transforming robot using a piece of computer-prompted smart plastic.
The "paper" in this case is a flexible circuit board with copper hinges that contract when heated. An electronic pulse from the microcircuit triggers the heat, and therefore the folding process—kind of like a Shrinky Dink—and modeling software can determine what preprogrammed design the robot will take (in this case, a cute crab). When the structural work is complete, an embedded motor takes over and allows the robot to become mobile. All this happens without any help from humans.

While this makes for an infinitely entertaining parlor trick, these flatpack robots could have some real-world value: Their slim profile and self-assembling skills make them perfect for squeezing into tight spaces for search-and-rescue missions. [New Scientist]
ISTANBUL, TURKEY - MAY 18: Cedi Osman during the 2017 Euroleague Basketball ANGT Players Educational Session at Sinan Erdem Dome on May 18, 2017 in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo by Francesco Richieri/EB via Getty Images)
Cleveland Cavaliers rookie small forward Cedi Osman looks like he's here to stay.
According to Joe Vardon of cleveland.com, the Cleveland Cavaliers are uninterested in trading rookie small forward Cedi Osman.
“…the Cavs have 22-year-old rookie Cedi Osman whom they signed from Turkey and have said they do not wish to trade him.”
Richard Jefferson, a 37-year-old small forward and soon-to-be 17-year NBA veteran is on the last guaranteed season of his contract. Though he seems like an ageless wonder at times, a testament to his natural athleticism, he's firmly in the twilight of his career. Small forward Jeff Green signed a one-year deal with the Cavs this summer and even if Kyle Korver were to play small forward next season (he's been working with the forwards after practice), he's a 36-year-old wing with whose contract isn't guaranteed past the 2018-2019 season.
Lastly, with shooting guard Iman Shumpert's durability and availability via trade a cause of constant speculation, Osman could be a suitable replacement for Shumpert. Shumpert, like Osman, is a versatile defender and a player who has shown the potential to make a consistent impact on offense (though Shumpert has never quite put it together).
For those that want the Cavaliers to both have youth on the roster and to begin growing their talent organically, the idea that the team wants to keep their 22-year-old forward is music to their ears. For those that believe in Osman's potential, the Cavs are also making the right move because they're choosing to develop a prospect that has the talent to be a rotation player on a championship-contending team.
Right now, head coach Tyronn Lue says Osman's job is to learn and compete but that he liked what he saw from the rookie in his first game. Namely, Osman's defense and intelligence.
Offensively, Osman likes the Cleveland Cavaliers up-and-down pace.
“Here in the NBA they play a lot of fast basketball,” he said. “Overseas it's not like that. It's more halfcourt plays and stuff. But here always running, fastbreak points, easy points. That's not a problem for me. Overseas I was playing like this all the time. I'm the guy with a lot of energy and the guy who likes to run the floor all the time. I think that will not be a problem for me.”
He played at the highest pace of any Cav in the preseason opener (outside of center Kendrick Perkins) and even his nifty bucket in the post against the Atlanta Hawks was a quick and aggressive move.
Though he didn't make a three in his first game, he's expected to be a consistent three-point shooter for the Cavs. Osman won't play in the Cleveland Cavaliers second preseason game, so that he can rest after playing more than expected in the preseason opener.
Osman has considered himself to be a Cav since the team selected him with the 31st overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. He built a strong relationship with Cleveland Cavaliers former general manager David Griffin. Though Griffin was eventually replaced by Koby Altman, the current front office regime seems invested in Osman too, having turned down multiple trade offers for Osman and signing him with their mid-level exception (MLE). Now, Osman is under contract for at least three more years and will be a restricted free agent should he choose not to accept his qualifying offer in 2020-2021.
As a restricted free agent, the Cavs have the right to match any offer he receives to keep him on the team. Compare Osman's contract with Jefferson, Korver or Green, other wings the Cleveland Cavaliers signed this season. Or even compare it to the contract of second-year pro Kay Felder, who the Cavs spent $2.5 million to select in the second round of the 2016 NBA Draft. Felder has only a partially guaranteed salary in this season and non-guaranteed next season. It's apparent, just from comparing and contrasting their player contracts, that the Cleveland Cavaliers value Osman's youth and potential.
When the team moves a guaranteed contract to make room for Dwyane Wade, don't expect Cedi to go anywhere.
Former Liberal Party candidate Alan Sexton in a Youtube video. Credit:YouTube "The inbred Arab brain seeks domination and wants to be bullied," his post says. "Strong men are adored, respected BUT never loved. Ie, current deputy mayor of Auburn. These guys in power were far more harmless than being gone. "One World Government and one world currency isn't possible with despots in the system. All planned by worse bastards behind the scenes. Every central bank in the world is now controlled by [Rothschild] except North Korea, Cuba and Iran. They are nearly there." When Parramatta Liberal councillor Steven Issa replied that he was "not sure how to feel about your comments", Dr Sexton sought to reassure him.
Alan Sexton's Facebook post. "The Arab psyche I'm describing is not the Christian version," he posted. "I don't think interbreeding is prominent outside Islam. Correct me if you will!" After he was approached about his comments by Fairfax Media, Dr Sexton said he would withdraw from the state executive elections for the good of the party. Alan Sexton's Facebook page. Credit:Alan Sexton, Facebook NSW Liberal director Tony Nutt has since confirmed Dr Sexton has resigned from the party altogether.
Dr Sexton - a consultant anaesthetist to Westmead Hospital - is on a ticket for election as a federal council delegate and for a position on the party's influential constitutional standing committee. He was part of the official "Mainstream Conservative" ticket for the NSW Liberal state council elections, which is aligned with the party's Right faction. Featured on its literature as endorsing the ticket are former prime minister Tony Abbott, NSW Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, state MPs Tanya Davies and Kevin Conolly and state MLC Scot MacDonald. A separate post by Dr Sexton states that he is in favour of an immigration process whereby "there needs to be 95% integration before the next phase of immigration. Immigration without integration is invasion". Dr Sexton has also posted that US President Barack Obama is of "Islamic faith" - a demonstrably false claim made by local extreme right wing political groups - and attacks the United Nations as "a corrupt, incompetent and godless institution".
In 2013 Dr Sexton visited India with Parramatta MP Geoff Lee and Alan Manly, managing director of private college operator Group Colleges Australia. In an interview with Indian television, Dr Sexton sought to reassure viewers that Australia "is not a racist country at all". "Within the professions ... you are judged by how hard you work and the contribution you make," he said. "It has nothing to do with skin colour. And that's how it's always been". On Friday, when confronted with the comments, Dr Sexton said: "Oh dear, you have caught me out big time, haven't you?"
Asked if he stood by his comments about the "inbred Arab brain", Dr Sexton said: "No, I don't stand by the comments. I'm completely in error." He explained that he has made comment because of "anxiety" about Middle East violence and because he was in an emotional state after the shooting of police worker Curtis Cheng by radicalised teenager Farhad Jabar in Parramatta. On his comment about Mr Obama's faith, Dr Sexton said there was "some controversy about his birth certificate" and that he had "placed a lot of senior Islamic people into senior positions in the United States". He admitted he had "no proof" that Mr Obama was a Muslim.
But he stood by his comments about the United Nations. "I believe there has been significant corruption in the United Nations," he said. Asked if he is racist, Dr Sexton replied: "Not at all". NSW Jewish Board of Deputies chief executive Vic Alhadeff described Dr Sexton's "stereotyping of Arabs and Jews" as "despicable." "All fair-minded Australians reject this bigotry with the contempt it deserves," he said. "Such views should never make their way onto any political party's executive body."
Let me tell you a little story.
When I was about ten years old my mum wanted me to go to a course where I should learn to use a keyboard with ten fingers efficiently. Because, well, it was useful at that time and it should be such an effective system. I refused and said that I had done it several years without this system and I would be fine. She on the other hand attended and after completing the course, she came back to show me how great it worked and to prove me wrong. Without surprise I could write not only a lot faster, but without making as many mistakes as she did. Why was that? Not because the course was bad, not even because the system was bad. Just because she had good theoretical information with little practice and I had basically no theoretical knowledge whatsoever but loads of practical infield experience. I learned typing by trial-and-error, I learned it by chatting, by surfing the web and by writing articles. That is why it felt easy to me, it felt natural. My mother, on the other hand, had her mind in the way. The mind hat to control the body, it had to “tell” the hands what they had to do, while my hands knew it for themselves.
When it comes to learning there are two “institutions” of yourself that you have to teach: the mind and the body. Take riding a bike for example: You are told how to ride it but then you have to experience it for yourself in order to really learn it. This applies to everything you do!
Your mind is capable of storing information and understanding new concepts. Then it can proceed to apply these new concepts and to teach them to the body, tell it what to do. That means that theoretical learning lacks the step of teaching the body. In chronological order you would have to teach the mind first and then the mind has to teach the body when it comes to theoretical learning.
In practical learning on the other hand, you learn by experience. You learn by doing things over and over again. That is why some people without any formal education can outperform educated scholars because they have tons of experience on their hands.
There lies the big difference: While after theoretical learning your mind has to guide your body to perform and the body still has to learn. Practical learning on the other hand combines both. That is why practical learning is the only way of learning!
Event theoretical learning must lead to experience, must lead to action. Only action can transform knowledge into wisdom and education is only good and acceptable if it leads inevitably into action!
Even when it comes to abstract things, that take place in your mind, math for example. You can read or hear about the processes that work there, but in order to fully understand them, in order to be able to use them in an efficient way, you have to work with them, and you have to apply them over and over again.
So in conclusion don't think you have learned something just because you heard/read about it in school, in a class or in a book. You have learned nothing until you are capable of applying it in the real world. “I know how to do that” is not a valid way of expressing that you can handle something. So go out there and practise, practise, practise! Turn your theoretical knowledge, which can be really good, into practical knowledge, which is equal to pure gold!

— The Transportation Security Administration is once again the subject of national scrutiny, this time after aggressively screening a 7-year-old female passenger with cerebral palsy which caused her family to miss their flight.
The girl, identified as Dina Frank in a report by The Daily, was waiting with her family on Monday to board a flight departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York headed to Florida.
Since Dina walks with the aid of leg braces and crutches, she cannot pass through airport metal detectors, and must instead submit to a pat-down by TSA agents.
Dina, who is also reportedly developmentally disabled, is usually frightened by the procedure. Her family reportedly requests that agents on hand take the time to introduce themselves to her.
However, the agents on duty at the time began to handle her aggressively instead.
Air travel is difficult to the family due to Dina's disabilities, but the nature of Monday's inspection was especially traumatic for the child.
“They make our lives completely difficult,” her father, Dr. Joshua Frank, a Long Island pediatrician, told The Daily. “She's not a threat to national security.”
Frank taped the encounter, which ended when a supervisor inspected her crutches and let them pass. But agents followed up and insisted upon doing a full inspection of Dina.
Ultimately, the family missed their flight.
“They're harassing people. This is totally misguided policy,” Frank told The Daily. “Yes, I understand that TSA is in charge of national security and there's all these threats. [But] for her to be singled out, it's crazy.”
Dina, from Long Island, had recently experienced triumph after Botox and phenol injections helped her to gain control of her legs, enough to take several unassisted steps.
After being born prematurely and suffering from bleeding in the brain, Dina struggled for years to get around, even enduring a double hip replacement to assist in her recovery, CBS New York reported.
UPDATE: The TSA issued a statement defending their decision to pat-down the girl.
“TSA has reviewed the incident and determined that our officers followed proper screening procedures in conducting a modified pat-down on the child,” the agency said.
A month ago, news came that revenue from streaming services had surpassed CD sales for the first time in history. Now, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that after securing $400 million in fresh funding, Spotify is now worth more than the entire US recorded music industry.
The deal pushed the streaming service up to a net value of $8.4 billion, more than double that of its nearest competitor Pandora, which sits at around $3.5 billion. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, the revenue of the entire industry as of 2014 was $6.97 billion, which accounts for physical sales, digital purchases, and yes, streaming.
Streaming income, which includes paid subscriptions and ad earnings, accounted for 27% of the recorded music industry's $6.97 billion earnings. Yet Spotify, just one company that makes up that percentage, is actually worth more than every single US retail music revenue source combined. Given, Spotify is an international company, but either way the math is fascinating.
Of course, the data is actually comparing two different things, in that one is value (Spotify's 8.4 billion) and the other is revenue (RIAA's $6.97 billion). The thing is, valuation is determined by an estimate of future profits, but Spotify has never actually turned a profit. Essentially, the report is suggesting that with the way things are trending, the US music industry's valuation could eventually equal its revenue, with Spotify being more valuable overall.
In the good news column, the 25% increase in streaming revenue more than offset the 8.7% drop in permanent digital download sales. So while the industry as a whole has remained pretty stagnant for the last five years (there was a 0.5% drop from 2013 to 2014), at least it's not getting much worse.
DK Rap is the Song that appeared at the beginning of the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64 right when you turned the system on. DK Rap is both loved and hated by both fans and critics. Its also the first time in a Nintendo published game to use the word "Hell". When it was remixed and used in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the word "Hell" was replaced with "Heck.
The general style of the song (musically) is very similar to Run D.M.C.'s 1983 song "It's Like That".

Response from the creator
Grant Kirkhope, the composer of Donkey Kong 64, said the following in 2010 (many years after the game was released):
"Aaaaarrrggghhhh.... Don't mention the DK Rap... it wasn't my fault honest! Blame George Andreas the game designer — it was all his idea. I still get made fun off at Big Huge Games about the DK Rap. What can I say, it was supposed to be a joke — you know, monkeys rapping about pineapples and bananas — and it wasn't supposed to be a serious attempt at rap music. Oddly enough, Nintendo still used it on Super Smash Brothers and had it re-mixed by some Japanese DJ... weird! I think my tombstone will read, "here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap, may God have mercy on his soul". Heh!"
Lyrics
Here, here, here we go, So they're finally here performing for you, If you know the words you can join in too, Put your hands together if you want to clap, As we take you through this monkey rap! Huh! DK, Donkey Kong! He's the leader of the bunch you know him well, He's finally back to kick some tail, His coconut gun can fire in spurts, If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt, He's bigger, faster and stronger too, He's the first member of the DK crew! Huh! DK, Donkey Kong! DK, Donkey Kong is here! This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes, She can shrink in size to suit her mood, She's quick and nimble when she needs to be, She can float through the air and climb up trees, If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong, With a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong! Huh! DK, Donkey Kong! He has no style, he has no grace, This Kong has a funny face, He can handstand when he needs to, And stretch his arms out just for you, Inflate himself just like a balloon, This crazy Kong just digs this tune! Huh! DK, Donkey Kong! DK, Donkey Kong is here! He's back again and about time too, And this time he's in the mood, He can fly real high with his jetpack on, With his pistols out he's one tough Kong, He'll make you smile when he plays his tune, But Kremlings beware 'cause he's after you! Huh! DK, Donkey Kong! Huh! Finally he's here for you, It's the last member of the DK crew, This Kong's so strong, it isn't funny, He'll make a Kremling cry out for mummy, He can pick up a boulder with relative ease, Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze, He may move slow, he can't jump high, But this Kong is one hell of a guy!

The following seven Roman mosaics are all currently on display in the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme National Museum, Rome. Mosaics were a common feature of Roman private homes and public buildings across the empire from Africa to Antioch. Mosaics, otherwise known as opus tesellatum, were made with small black, white, and coloured squares typically measuring between 0.5 and 1.5 cm, but fine details were often rendered using even smaller pieces as little as 1 mm in size. These squares (tesserae or tessellae) were cut from materials such as marble, tile, glass, smalto (glass paste),pottery, stone, and even shells. A base was first prepared with fresh mortar, and the tesserae positioned as close together as possible with any gaps then filled with liquid mortar in a process known as grouting. The whole was then cleaned and polished. Mosaics were by no means limited to flooring. Vaults, columns, and fountains were often decorated with mosaic, especially in Roman baths. Popular subjects were figures and scenes from Roman mythology, landscapes, and still-lifes.

The Miami Heat will be without shooting guard Gerald Green for two more games, who has been out since being hospitalized last week.
Miami released a statement on Nov. 10 announcing the suspension, via Jeff Zillgitt of USA Today:
According to Manny Navorro of the Miami Herald, a Nov. 4 City of Miami police incident report states Green, who had bloody hands at the time, asked the front desk of his condo to call paramedic before walking outside and collapsing. When he woke up, Green walked inside and assaulted someone who was trying to stop him from going back into his apartment, per the report. Navorro provided additional details from Miami police officer John Collins' report:
“Mr. Green tried to make his way up to his unit. When victim #1 tried to hold Mr. Green in the lobby area for fire rescue, Mr. Green punched the victim in the right eye." [...] “Fire rescue had the patient restrained due to the patient becoming very loud and verbally combative,” the report says. “Fire rescue requested that the Sgt. handcuff the patient.” An assault unit was contacted, according to the report, but the victim did not want to press charges.
Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports initially reported the suspension. Wojnarowski added that sources said the team punished Green for “detrimental conduct,” and he will return Friday following games against the Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz.
"I'm deeply sorry," Green said in a statement on Saturday, via Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press. "I'm deeply saddened for what happened but I'm ready to move on. I'm ashamed. ... I can't apologize enough."
"It's personal and I'm going to leave it at that," Heat president Pat Riley said when asked about the issue, per Reynolds.
Ira Winderman of the Sun-Sentinel noted Green was recently hospitalized for an undisclosed reason. Head coach Erik Spoelstra was not specific when he addressed the situation, but he did mention Green was healthy and safe during his hospital stay. Ethan Skolnick of the Miami Herald noted Green was ill the night before the incident occurred and the team treated him.
As a result, Green has only played in three games this season, with the last one coming on Nov. 1. He averaged 11.9 points and 1.9 three-pointers per game in 2014-15 for the Phoenix Suns.
The Heat signed him to a one-year deal this offseason to provide depth on the wing alongside 33-year-old Dwyane Wade and 30-year-old Luol Deng.
In May, the U.S. Energy Information Administration released a daily energy brief summarizing the current and future state of nuclear energy production in America. According to the EIA, nuclear's share of the nation's electricity generating capacity will drop from 20 percent to 11 percent by 2050. That decline coincides with a predicted growth in electricity demand of up to 92 percent — nearly doubling current consumption — over the same period.
Nuclear-powered plants can produce reliable, base-level electricity — typically generated by fossil fuels — with zero carbon emissions. Engineering innovations have resulted in advanced nuclear reactors that are much safer, more efficient, and more affordable than reactors currently in use. Such technology should have a promising future as a part of the U.S. energy portfolio. Unfortunately, regulatory requirements here at home have driven the cost of bringing new reactor technology to market so high that power companies are instead lobbying for billions in subsidies to keep decades-old technology in operation.
Transatomic, a company founded by nuclear engineers from MIT, are developing molten salt reactors that are “walk-away” safe (they do not require constant supervision), and produce less than half as much radioactive waste yearly as traditional nuclear reactors. The scientists at NuScale Power have developed a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) that can be assembled in a factory and shipped on a flatbed truck, reducing up-front construction costs and providing more flexibility for electricity providers. Because of their small size, SMRs also cannot melt down. Bill Gates' nuclear company (TerraPower) has designed a traveling wave reactor that can run continuously for 40 years, eliminating the need for refueling as the reactor consumes all of its original fuel.
In order to get their technologies to market, nuclear innovators must navigate a complex, burdensome regulatory framework established decades ago in the name of public safety. Innovation has put to rest many of the safety concerns that regulation was meant to protect us from. This regulation now operates mainly as a barrier to clean, affordable energy. NuScale Power's SMR technology offers perhaps the best hope of next generation nuclear finding its way to the US power grid, but even that may take a decade or more to become reality.
In the beginning of 2017, NuScale submitted the first-ever design certification for a SMR in the United States. That application, 12,000 pages long, must be reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At the end of the 40-month review period, the NRC will issue NuScale a design certification for their reactor. That certification will be valid for 15 years, during which time NuScale will file for a combined license to build and operate that plant. The licensing process will take another 5 years, after which time construction finally can begin.
The NRC charges $265 per professional staff-hour to review permits, licenses, and other required documentation. According to Mason Baker, Chief Legal Officer for the Utah Area Municipal Power Supply (which is working with NuScale to build their first SMR), UAMPS relies on a 50 percent financial partnership with the Department of Energy to cover initial development costs. Without such support, the cost of regulatory compliance — which Baker estimated would amount to seven figures by the end of the submission process — would prevent the project from ever getting off the ground.
TerraPower signed an agreement with China National Nuclear Corporation at the end of 2015 to build its reactor design overseas. The company hopes eventually to bring the technology back home.
If the U.S. wants a future of diversified, clean energy, the NRC needs to reform the way it permits and licenses nuclear technologies. The current framework effectively stymies innovation and forces nuclear companies to rely heavily on government support. Heavy government involvement in energy production does not make for a healthy, competitive energy market.
Correction: An earlier version of this op-ed misidentified the U.S. Energy Information Administration and mischaracterized the nature of TerraPower's funding with regard to its reactor in China and its decision to do business there.

The police chief of Pacific, a city of about 5,000 people located primarily in south King County, was arrested on suspicion of DUI Tuesday night, according to the Pacific Police Department.
The chief, John Calkins, was arrested in Bonney Lake.
A graduate of Central Washington University who worked as an officer in Algona and Ellensburg, Calkins joined the Auburn Police Department in 1979 before retiring in 1993 to open a private investigation business, according to The News Tribune.
He also served as the Auburn Police Officers Guild president shortly before his retirement.
Calkins are announced as Pacific's first director of public safety in August 2000 – only two days after the application deadline passed, The News Tribune reported at the time.
Officers were tipped to Calkins' alleged drunken driving after someone following him westbound on state Route 410 called police, Bonney Lake police Sgt. Thomas Longtine said.
He was pulled over going westbound and tried to take a Breathalizer but couldn't, perhaps because of a medical problem, Longtine said.
Calkins are given a blood test, police said, but the result were not released Wednesday.
The police chief was cited and released after agreeing to appear for an arraignment in Bonney Lake Municipal Court.
It is not uncommon for people arresetd on suspicion of DUI to be released after being cited, especially if they have no previous criminal history, State Patrol trooper Keith Trowbridge said. Drivers who are combative or have a poor driving history are more often jailed.
Calkins did not return calls for comment, and other Pacific Police Department officials differed calls to Bonney Lake police.
Pacific Mayor Richard Hildreth told The Associated Press Wednesday that the police chief has begun an “open-ended” vacation. His first court appearance is next Wednesday.
What defines such a republic? How about an executive that ignores the rule of law, commits war-crimes and then destroys the actual evidence? Today's bombshell is that the CIA has done just that with respect to tapes made recording the torture of enemy combatants. Read the whole story. We live in a country where the government can detain indefinitely, torture in secret, and then secretly destroy the tapes of torture sessions to protect its own staff:
The videotapes showed agency operatives in 2002 subjecting terror suspects including Abu Zubaydah, the first detainee in CIA custody to severe interrogation techniques. They were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that tapes documenting controversial interrogation methods could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy, several officials said. The CIA said today that the decision to destroy the tapes had been made "within the CIA itself," and they were destroyed to protect the safety of undercover officers and because they no longer had intelligence value. The agency was headed at the time by Porter J. Goss. Through a spokeswoman, Goss declined this afternoon to comment on the destruction of the tapes.
My italics. This was a deliberate act to destroy evidence of war-crimes and to protect war criminals from facing the rule of law. The Congress needs to find out who authorized the destruction of those tapes. I should add that this is not the first time that videotapes of alleged torture sessions have been "lost." The same happened in the case of Jose Padilla:
The missing DVD dates from March 2, 2004. It contains a video of the last interrogation session of Padilla, then a declared 'enemy combatant' under an order from President Bush, while he was being held in military custody at a U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. But in recent days, in the course of an unusual court hearing about Padilla's mental condition, a government lawyer disclosed to a surprised courtroom that the Defense Intelligence Agency which had custody of the evidence was no longer able to locate the DVD. As a result, it was not included in a packet of classified DVDs that was recently turned over to defense lawyers under orders from Judge Cooke. The disclosure that the Pentagon had lost a potentially important piece of evidence in one of the U.S. government's highest-profile terrorism cases was met with claims of incredulity by some defense lawyers and human-rights groups monitoring the case. "This is the kind of thing you hear when you're litigating cases in Egypt or Morocco or Karachi," said John Sifton, a lawyer with Human Rights Watch, one of a number of groups that has criticized the U.S. government's treatment of Padilla. "It is simply not credible that they would have lost this tape. The administration has shown repeatedly they are more interested in covering up abuses than getting to the bottom of whether people were abused."
A potential opening for Congressional investigation:
The tapes, recorded in 2002 and destroyed in 2005, were not provided to the September 11 Commission despite a formal request to the CIA for "transcripts and any other documentary evidence" taken from interrogations. The Commission completed its work in 2004. The story also reports that CIA attorneys told "federal prosecutors in 2003 and 2005, who relayed the information to a federal court in the Moussaoui case, that the C.I.A. did not possess recordings of interrogations sought by the judge in the case." Moussaoui had sought the tapes as exculpatory evidence.
This administration commits war-crimes, hides the evidence from federal law officers and the 9/11 Commission and then destroys the evidence completely. Give that some time to sink in.

I'm balancing on my head, and I don't think I've ever been more relaxed. I am one of about 30 women who have assumed similarly vertical positions early on a Sunday morning in a yoga studio on New York's Upper East Side. Tibetan chants and dimmed lights block out the city's chaos just beyond the door. Motivational quotes painted on the walls — jealousy works the opposite way you want it to! — seep into my consciousness.
Seconds after our petite Indian yogi leads us through our final “ommm,” piercing lights flicker on. People roll in tables of merchandise like stagehands between acts of a play, converting our urban ashram into a retail temple. The women gathered at Lululemon Athletica — the Mecca of yoga lifestyle gear — know the drill. The free class is over, and they lunge toward the register to retrieve their 15% off coupons, still catching their breath from their last downward dog. One woman already has three $52 Alluring tank tops in hand. “If you want to be successful in this industry,” says Christine Day, Lululemon's CEO, “it's about being authentic.”
A cult following is the most coveted accessory in retail, and Lululemon's is even more lustworthy than its Velocity Gym Bag. It wasn't built on the work of some Jobs-ian swami, however, but on the sources of Lulu founder and chairman Chip Wilson's own spiritual awakening. Wilson has mixed a heady self-actualizing cocktail from equal parts Landmark Forum (seminars based on the philosophy of Werner Erhard), the books of motivational business guru Brian Tracy, and Oprah-endorsed best seller The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne. He is now hard at work formalizing them in a Lululemon “internal constitution.”
“It's the first time I've heard of anyone almost directly using the techniques of cults and applying them to their business,” says Douglas Atkin, author of The Culting of Brands. Drawing on those techniques, and with virtually zero advertising, Lululemon has converted the most popular yoga teachers from Beverly Hills to Boston (and their students) into a devoted — and self-propagating — clientele. In a little more than 10 years, Lululemon has grown from a single storefront on the surf side of Vancouver, British Columbia, to a public company with more than 100 outlets and $340 million in annual revenue. “I have not been able to find any company that compares with what they do,” says Suzanne Price, a retail analyst with ThinkEquity, who points to Lululemon stores ringing up $1,800 in sales per square foot, compared with only $600 for retailers such as J.Crew and Abercrombie & Fitch.
Wilson claims he didn't start Lululemon merely to sell $90 leggings, but also to help his customers limber up for their journey to self-esteem and empowerment. As he writes in the “Chip's Musings” section of the company Web site, “The law of attraction” — the central tenet of The Secret, that visualizing goals is the key to attaining them — “is the fundamental law that Lululemon was built on from its 1998 inception.” He goes on to explain the company's meta-mission: “Our vision is ‘to elevate the world from mediocrity to greatness,' and we are growing so we can train more people and spread the word of The Secret — which to us at Lululemon is not so secret.”
In the early days, Wilson learned quickly that a meditative bent can be a liability on the sales floor. “When we first started, we hired nothing but yogis,” he tells me. “But it didn't work because they were too slow. So we started hiring runners who like yoga. They're more on the ball, more type A.” Lululemon now arms its employees, or “educators,” with a “learning library” that includes Steven Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and Tracy's The Phoenix Seminar on the Psychology of Achievement. To celebrate their first anniversary on staff, educators are rewarded with Landmark Forum seminars. “We feel like Landmark is a tool,” says Day, a 20-year Starbucks veteran who has attended Landmark training. “It's created a culture of accountability.”
On its Web site, Lululemon says the training program has been “such a success that the Lululemon people have created a life for themselves that most people could only dream of.” That would certainly apply to Wilson, whose net worth is reportedly close to $370 million. His inner voice urged him to dump almost 7 million shares when Lululemon held its U.S. IPO in the summer of 2007, earning him more than $100 million [Editor's Note: He is still the largest shareholder, with 35%.]

New information emerged regarding Nvidia's Pascal GPU, covering the total compute performance of the much-anticipated FinFET-based chip.
Nvidia talked about the Pascal-based Drive PX 2 module at CES 2016, and it quickly got everyone's attention.
The Drive PX 2 is simply a car supercomputer that relies on the power of graphics processors in order to help engineers make autonomous cars.
Today's information is available courtesy of a member from 3Dcenter, who compiled a number of slides and details that were undisclosed so far, pointing out the highlights of the upcoming Pascal graphics processor.
So far, we know the following aspects about Nvidia's upcoming flagship Pascal GP100 graphics processing unit:
- Pascal graphics architecture
- When we compare it to Maxwell, Pascal rolls two-fold performance per watt
- Successor to the GM200 GPU found in the GTX Titan X and GTX 980 Ti
- Features about 17 billion transistors, two times more than the GM200
- Uses 16nm FinFET base from TSMC
- 4 Mb bus interface, comparable to the Fiji GPU power from the AMD Fury models
- Has half-precision FP16 compute at double the rate of full-precision FP32
- Will sport four 4-Hi HBM2 stacks, giving it 16 GB of VRAM, as well as 8-Hi stacks mounting to 32 GB for professional computations in SKUs
- It will sport exclusive compatibility with next-gen IBM PowerPC server processors due to NVLink
- DirectX 12 feature will be at 12_1 or higher levels
- Launch is scheduled for the second half of 2016
Based on a number of slides from an independent researcher, the Nvidia Pascal GPU100 features Stacked DRAM (1 TB/s) giving it as much as 12 TFLOPs of Single-Precision (FP32) compute performance. The flagship GPU is purportedly able to provide four TFLOPs of Double-Precision (FP64) compute performance as well.
Recent reports show that no less than four different Pascal graphics cards are being tested. Each of the four GPUs will sport relatively similar values, but the GP100 GPU will be the main star of the bunch, thanks to its unprecedented performance.
Speculations roam that we might see the official release of the Tesla GPU during Q2 of 2016.
The flagship GP100 GPU is the direct descendant of the GM200 GPU, a graphics processing unit mostly famous for its performances in the GTX Titan X and GTX 980 Ti.
Nvidia is expected to give more details on its next-gen GPUs at the company's GPU Technology Conference that is slated to occur in early April.
Until then, you can take a more in-depth look at the slides, courtesy of WCCFTech.

Winger pens three-year deal
Kyle Bennett has penned a new three-year deal with Pompey.
The winger played a crucial role in the Blues' League Two title success last term, netting six goals in 44 games.
He found the net in four successive appearances during March to help Paul Cook's side climb into the top three.
Bennett said: “My intention has always been to stay at this club and sign a new deal.
“Having been here for two years now, I feel really settled and comfortable living in the area. It was a good time to get this sorted for me and my family.
“I think that the fans saw more of the real me this season and now I want to kick on as we head into League One.
“We all knew that promotion was the ultimate – and only – aim. But having played in three different divisions, I can tell you without doubt that the fourth tier is the hardest one to get out of.
“There is a lot more physicality needed, while League One is far more suited to our squad and the way that the gaffer likes us to play.”
Bennett joined Pompey from Doncaster in the summer of 2015 and has scored a total of 13 goals in 95 appearances during his time at Fratton Park.
When I'm putting a bracket together, I usually find that the teams that pretty much everybody thinks are good actually are, but there are always a few that don't measure up to the hype, even this late in the season.
Here is a look at a handful of teams that are in or near the rankings, but have tournament resumes that are still lacking.
The Badgers went into Monday's bracket with a record of 0-3 against the top 50 teams in the RPI, losing at Creighton, North Carolina and Purdue. Teams without top 50 RPI win rarely even make the tournament, let alone get seeded highly. They haven't lost to anyone outside that group, but they missed their chances to pick up higher quality wins in non-conference play. Unfortunately, unlike the Big East for Xavier, the Big Ten won't provide many chances to pick some up in the league.
Wisconsin did win at Indiana, which figures to be one of the more confounding teams that the selection committee will deal with. For now, the Hoosiers are a middle of the bracket team and the only team in the bracket that the Badgers have beaten. That win may look better as the season goes on, but right now, they can't count on that. The Badgers only play Michigan State once and that game will be in East Lansing. The Spartans have also been disappointing though, so it's hard to say what a win there will mean to the selection committee.
Minnesota and Maryland are the only Big Ten teams comfortably into the top 50 of the RPI that are left on the Badgers schedule.
If Wisconsin contends for the Big Ten regular season title, as expected, I'm sure their profile will measure up well for a seed befitting a team ranked in the mid-teens. That profile is quite there yet though.
I have to admit that when I looked at the AP Top 25, which I rarely do since they don't have a bearing on the selection process, I was stunned to find Kansas State in there. When I put together the bracket this morning, the Wildcats were not on the list of teams under consideration.
Kansas State has beaten absolutely nobody of note. The Wildcats are 0-4 against the top 100 teams in the RPI. They are close losses, but still losses. Their best win is Nebraska-Omaha. They also beat current Horizon League leader Wisconsin-Green Bay. When your best wins are against teams with dashes in their names at this point of the season, you probably shouldn't be ranked.
Poll voters don't put much thought into voting sometimes. They see a power conference team with a gaudy record and rank them. It is pretty obvious that Kansas State benefitted from that. I suspect that when the rankings are released this week, the Wildcats won't be there.
St. Mary's tournament resume is largely going to be based on how the Gaels perform against Gonzaga. So far, not so good, after the Zags trounced them at home over the weekend.
The Gaels played a couple of decent teams outside the league, winning at Dayton and beating Mountain West leader Nevada at home. However, they also lost at home to UT Arlington, and that loss will look worse as the season wears on.
Dayton may or may not make the tournament as an at-large team. Right now, they are a middle of the bracket team. Nevada will only make the NCAA tournament if it wins the Mountain West's automatic bid.
That's not much to hang your hat on. The West Coast conference, aside from the games against Gonzaga, only provides opportunities to damage your resume by adding bad losses to it. If the Gaels win the rest of their games, but end up 0-3 against the Bulldogs, they won't get a seed that would indicate that they are a top 25 team. A couple of other losses beyond that and making the tournament at all could be in doubt.
The Trojans got off to a great start, winning their first 14 games. The problem for them is that there wasn't much quality in those wins. SMU is the best team they have beaten. That's a nice team and will probably make the tournament, but so far, that's it. USC also won at Texas A&M, which was supposed to be one of the better teams in the SEC after Kentucky, but they have disappointed.
USC suffered its first loss in a blowout at Oregon at the end of December. Losing to Oregon, even ugly, isn't the end of the world though. Losing at home to Cal hurts, even though the Bears are in the latest bracket. Getting crushed at Utah is particularly bad.
The win over SMU is enough to get the Trojans into the middle of the bracket for now, but there is nothing here yet to indicate that this is a team that should be in the top 25. The Trojans have chances to earn that ranking in the next week and a half when Arizona and UCLA visit.
The Gamecocks were not ranked, but are close enough that they may be when this week's rankings are released. They should not be though.
South Carolina would be another power conference team that benefits from a gaudy record and very little to back it up. The Gamecocks the best wins are Georgia and Mississippi in conference play. Neither of those teams are in my bracket. Ole Miss isn't even on the consideration list.
The Gamecocks lost to Seton Hall and in-state rival Clemson, the only two teams that they have played that are in my bracket. They also got drilled at Memphis.
South Carolina's best player, Sindarius Thornwell was suspended for a month and missed all three of the Gamecock's losses. That is unfortunate, but the committee can't assume they would have won if he played. There can be some consideration given with regard to seeding, but they have to earn selection regardless.
South Carolina is in the bracket, but barely so, which says more about the quality of the teams at the bottom that it does South Carolina.
The Musketeers do reasonably well in the computer rankings and were ranked 15th in the most recent polls, but there isn't much to back that up yet. Xavier's best win, in RPI terms, is over Wake Forest, which isn't even on my list of teams under consideration for a spot in the bracket yet. The Musketeers have a win over Clemson in Orlando, which is their only win over a team in the bracket. They avoided playing a high number of 200+ RPI teams in non-conference play, which is partly why their ratings are so high. Xavier's loss at Colorado isn't great, but if that is the worst loss at the end of the year, it won't be a problem.
What the Musketeers lack is quality wins. They have had some chances, all on the road, but fell short at Baylor, Villanova and Butler -- the latter two in the past week.
Xavier will get more chances. That is the advantage of being in the Big East. Getting Myles Davis back into the fold should help them take advantage of them. Creighton visits Xavier on Monday and there will be a return trip to Omaha in February. The Musketeers will also host rematches with Villanova and Butler, and travel to archrival Cincinnati in a non-conference game. Xavier will have plenty of chances to live up to their rankings. They just haven't done it yet.
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that his committee plans to investigate government loan programs to private corporations in light of allegations of improper dealings between the White House and failed energy company Solyndra and wireless start-up LightSquared.
"I want to see when the president and his cronies are picking winners and losers… it wasn't because there were large contributions given to them," the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee said Tuesday morning on C-SPAN.

Issa said the committee was looking at whether it was improper for members of Congress or White House staff to select companies eligible for subsidized government loans when those companies could give campaign donations. Loan programs have been a popular tool to provide funding for popular industries — like tech, green energy, and American auto companies — at more favorable terms than could be secured privately.
The Obama administration has been defending itself against criticism by Republicans that it exerted improper influence to the aid of both companies.
Solyndra abruptly filed for bankruptcy earlier this month, surprising both employees and the administration, which had secured $535 million in low-interest loans for the company.
More from The Hill:
♦ Gibson Guitar is playing a Tea Party tune
♦ Environmental, green groups push back against Gibson
♦ White House doubles down on green energy loans
♦ Rep. Stearns: Fire top Energy Dept. official over Solyndra
♦ LightSquared investor: Influence peddling claims 'disgusting'
♦ Sen. Brown still waiting to play basketball with Obama
Republicans in Congress quickly mocked the bankruptcy as emblematic of the president's green technology initiatives under the stimulus bill — and noted that a key Solyndra investor had been a bundler for the Obama campaign. House Republicans say they have emails showing the White House pressuring Department of Energy bureaucrats to expedite the loan approvals, although the White House has argued that nothing improper occurred.
Republicans have also charged that the White House pressured an Air Force general to revise testimony before a closed congressional hearing to aid LightSquared, a wireless start-up company. Emails between the company and the White House make mention of the fact that the company's CEO would be attending Democratic fundraisers in Washington, and administration officials met with executives from the company on the same day that CEO Sanjiv Ahuja wrote a $30,400 check to the Democratic National Committee.
The company is facing a tough regulatory road after initial tests showed LightSquared's technology had been found to interfere with military and aviation GPS. But both the company and White House have denied any influence-peddling.
Although Issa did not specifically accuse the White House of wrongdoing, he suggested that government loan programs tempted corruption.
"This is another reason that crony capitalism … is dangerous, because they're going to pick winners that they ideologically, or in some cases because they support their candidacy, want to see win," Issa said.
The congressman said he also wanted to expand the investigation to see whether congressmen were also exerting influence on the bureaucracy, which is commonly tasked with approving low-interest government loans.
"We see that as a backdoor, easy way to end up with corruption in government," Issa said.

PKR strategy director Rafizi Ramli revealed why PKR had allowed a second term as Selangor MB for Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim. — Picture by Yusof Mat Isa
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 6 — Despite misgivings, PKR kept Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim as Selangor mentri besar a second term after PAS refused to endorse Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as Pakatan Rakyat's (PR) prime minister candidate, Rafizi Ramli shared, lifting the lid on the leadership crisis hobbling the pact a year after Election 2013.
With little political baggage, Khalid was the least objectionable choice to PAS, PKR or DAP with their patchy political cooperation before Election 2008, Rafizi said
He added that PAS's refusal to back Anwar underlined the division within the fledgling pact with none of the three component parties able to reach a consensus on candidates for key leadership positions.
“PAS did not agree with Anwar becoming the prime minister,” the PKR strategy director told a public forum last night on the Selangor crisis that could cleave apart the federal opposition alliance after seven short years.
Instead, Rafizi said a PAS delegation consisting of its president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang, Mohamad Sabu and the Islamist party's influential cleric Datuk Haron Din met with Anwar and told the de facto PR leader they wanted Umno's Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah to be prime minister if PR succeeded in taking Putrajaya.
Rafizi made the disclosure after the 100-strong audience pressed the Pandan MP, one of the chief engineers behind the ‘Kajang Move', to explain why PKR pushed the initiative only in January when party leaders held misgivings about Khalid's leadership from the latter's first term in office particularly after the former corporate captain's questionable RM70 million loan.
PAS Sepang MP, Hanipa Maidin, who was also present at the forum, said he could not confirm the matter.
“But if it was true, then I say it is most unethical,” the lawyer added.
Top leaders from the three PR parties will meet Sunday to discuss the mentri besar crisis but Rafizi cast doubt last night that the dispute will be resolved amicably or soon.
“If the issue of the prime minister can't even be sorted for six years, how can we sort this out?” the PKR strategist said.
Yesterday PKR secretary-general Datuk Saifuddin Nasution claimed Khalid's compromised integrity was a key reason behind the party's decision to seek a replacement, hours after slapping the former Selangor PKR chief with a show-cause letter for refusing to step down from office.
A report titled “The Decision to Replace the Selangor Mentri Besar” penned by Saifuddin that was sighted by Malay Mail Online cited Khalid's out-of-court settlement with Bank Islam over his RM70 million debt to the bank as the top reason for his ouster, saying the circumstances surrounding the deal had placed his integrity under suspicion.
The report noted that in March, a month after Bank Islam dropped its loan settlement suit against Khalid, two business deals worth hundreds of millions of ringgit were signed between the Selangor government and Eco World Berhad, a company controlled by Tan Sri Rashid Manaf, whom PKR said was an ex-lawyer of former Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin.
Rafizi told last night's forum his party colleagues suspected the out-of-court settlement was a crucial factor that facilitated the deal.
He also said PKR leaders also had suspicions about Khalid's business dealings since last year.
But the party initiated the Kajang Move only after receiving word just before the end of last year that the incumbent Selangor MB had tried to broker a deal with the bank through a middle-man.
“And that middle person is none other than Tan Sri Manaf,” Rafizi said, adding that the party then decided that Khalid's financial problems could be used to hold the party hostage to its political rivals.
The Kajang Move saw PKR's Lee Chin Cheh resign as Kajang representative less than a year after winning the state seat in Election 2013, paving the way for a by-election meant to gain Anwar entry into Selangor's law-making house and eventual takeover as mentri besar.
The plan was thwarted when the Appeals Court convicted the opposition leader of sodomising a former male aide, a ruling Anwar claimed was engineered to prevent him from leading Selangor.
The Kajang move drew criticism from many Selangor voters who called it overt politicking and unnecessary as Khalid had performed well as mentri besar.
Rafizi admitted at the forum that he took brickbats for engineering the move but insisted it was necessary to sustain support for the PR administration in the state.
“It was something that I had to do and I won't be apologetic about it,” he said.
It's an article of faith among Ron Paul's supporters that the media is ignoring the story of the year, or maybe the decade, or even the century or millennium: their candidate's pending rise to the Republican presidential nomination. Of course, Paul's backers talked the same way four years ago, when the Texas congressman's success was limited to a scattering of mostly distant second- and third-place finishes in caucuses that most other campaigns ignored, which explains why the political world is still treating him as more of a curiosity than a serious candidate.
But, the Paul crowd counters, things are different this time. And here they seem to have a point. Paul is generally faring better -- much better, in some instances -- in polls than he was in the 2008 cycle, running in the high single-digits nationally (better than Rick Perry) and emerging as a dark-horse contender to win Iowa, where a recent survey showed him bunched in what amounted to a four-way tie for the lead. And the center of the Republican Party has moved sharply to the right since 2008, toward the outsider-friendly anti-government purity that Paul embodies. Plus, the GOP race is unusually unsettled -- the "inevitable" Mitt Romney can't break 25 percent and Newt Gingrich, of all people, is now threatening to open up a wide lead nationally and in some of the early states -- and delegate apportionment rules have been altered in a way that could stretch out the process.

Paul's campaign insists it has a strategy to capitalize on this unique moment, one that relies on competing aggressively in Iowa and New Hampshire and gobbling up delegates in low-turnout caucuses where intensely loyal and well-organized supporters can dramatically affect the outcome. So shouldn't we treat Paul as a real prospect for the GOP nod -- or at least as real a prospect as Gingrich?
Actually, there's still a good reason not to: Despite his clearly improved standing, the evidence remains strong that Paul is a uniquely unacceptable option for a wide swath of the Republican electorate -- suggesting that he faces an impenetrable ceiling in his quest for the nomination.
Take, for example, an ABC News/Washington Post survey released this week that finds that Paul's favorable and unfavorable scores among GOP voters are roughly even -- 39 percent favorable and 34 percent unfavorable. The significance of this becomes clear when you see that the same poll pegs Romney's favorable rating at 56-29 percent and Gingrich's at 60-26. This suggests that Romney and Gingrich, at least for now, would both be acceptable nominees for most Republican voters, even those who are not now backing them. But Paul faces more resistance, presumably because of the areas where his platform runs counter to modern conservative orthodoxy (particularly on foreign policy) and because opinion-shaping conservative media outlets and commentators tend to afford him pariah status.
This point is reinforced by a CNN poll from just before Thanksgiving, which asked Republicans if they would be "disappointed" or "upset" if the party nominated each of the candidates. Twenty-eight percent said they would be if Romney is the candidate and 27 percent said the same about Gingrich, but Paul's number was nearly twice as big -- 50 percent, or the worst of any GOP candidate. Similarly, a new PPP poll in the key early state of Florida (which showed Gingrich opening a massive lead over Romney) put Paul's favorable/unfavorable score among Republicans at a poisonous 25/57 percent. He also rated as the least likable GOP candidate in a recent Fox News survey of national Republicans.
Granted, volatility has been the rule in the Republican race. Just a few months ago, Gingrich's unfavorable numbers were roughly where his favorable ones are now. But a series of strong debate performances, collapses by Rick Perry and Herman Cain, and favorable reassessments from numerous conservative commentators have turned him into something of a rock star among Republican voters. But it's hard to see Paul replicating this turnaround, mainly because he wears his apostasies as badges of honor. This ensures him a loyal and devoted following, but also hardens the determination of many Republican opinion leaders to marginalize him. To win a Republican presidential nomination these days, you need outlets like Fox News and voices like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh making your case -- or at least not actively undermining you.
This isn't to say that Paul's campaign is a waste of time. He's a valuable addition to the GOP debate stage and he provides a voice for a sizable number of voters who believe that the modern definition of conservatism has been distorted. Plus, he could potentially attract significant support and media coverage and influence the general election conversation if he decided to give up on the GOP and mount a third-party bid. But running in the general election as the Republican candidate? There's still no reason to think that will happen.
On Friday March 30, 2012, Federal District Judge William M. Conley struck down key provisions of Governor Scott Walker's marquee legislation, WI Act 10, which stripped public workers across the State of Wisconsin of their right to collectively bargain. Although Judge Conley ruled that the State was within it's right to deny public workers their bargaining rights, he enjoined the State from prohibiting the collection of dues, requiring yearly re-certifications of unions, and the mandate requiring that a majority of union members participate in elections.
In an interesting twist of fate, Judge Conley cited “Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission” multiple times in his ruling. Citizens United is the controversial Supreme Court ruling that opened the floodgates of Corporate spending in U.S. elections. It also allowed the formation of Super PACs, 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations that can raise unlimited amounts of contributions to run “issue ads”.
The ruling struck down provisions in the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, popularly known as the “McCain-Feingold Act.” It specifically referred to prohibitions on “electioneering communications” by corporations, unions and individuals. Perhaps the most contentious aspect of the ruling was the majority's opinion that corporations must be afforded the same First Amendment Protections as individuals. Key provisions of McCain-Feingold regulating the airing of “issue ads” had previously been struck down in “Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.”
Judge Conley wrote:
“…..unions engage — indeed, one of their core functions is to engage — in speech. See Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm'n. 130 S. Ct. 876, 900 (2010) (“Corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the discussion, debate and the dissemination of information and ideas that the First Amendment seeks to foster.”…….There is no dispute that the plaintiff unions engage in speech……This speech is not limited to the realm of politics, but also constitutes other forms of expressive activity…..
Under Act 10, general employees may still pay voluntary dues and their unions may still engage in speech, including political speech. In that way, Act 10 does not prohibit general employee unions' or their members' speech, but it does bar the most efficient method by which these unions collect and their members pay dues. Defendants also concede that general employee unions have lost dues and will continue to lose dues because of this barrier to ease of payment.”
“General Employees” is a category of public workers created by Act 10 to differentiate them from those exempted from the law, specifically most Firefighters and Police Officers. In his ruling, Judge Conley reasons, that the State could have mandated yearly recertification by the “general employee” unions except:
“….the court finds this onerous recertification provision would typically pass the admittedly low bar of rational basis review, but for defendants' failure to articulate and this court's inability to posit, how an annual, absolute majority vote by a wholly-voluntary union could rationally advance a reasonable purpose. Unlike the concern over work stoppages by public safety employees restricted as to their bargaining rights, the requirement for annual proof of support by an absolute majority of union members applies only to general employee unions who are unable to compel any participation of any employee in its union activities, even the payment of a “fair share” fee. The only right granted this union is to bargain collectively on an adjustment in base pay. Even if this Governor and the Legislature had a reasonable concern that this remaining bargaining right might be abused, the concern is not rationally advanced by an unprecedented burden on a voluntary union's right to continue to exist from year to year. On the contrary, it seems irrational to impose this unique burden on a voluntary union with highly restrictive bargaining rights while maintaining far less burden on public safety unions in which involuntary membership and monetary support continue to be mandated by law.”
The creation of two classes of unions by Act 10 repeatedly runs afoul of the Supreme Courts reasoning in its ruling on “Citizens United v Federal Election Commission“. Specifically, the court expressed concern that “The Government may also commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers. There is no basis for the proposition that, in the political speech context, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead to this conclusion.”
Signaling their intent on appealing the ruling, Governor Walker's spokesman Cullen Werwie said on Friday, “We are confident that the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will continue to uphold the constitutionality of the law,” It will be interesting to see how the Administration argues against key provisions of the “Citizens United” ruling in their attempt to rehabilitate Act 10. In the meantime, public employee unions in the State of Wisconsin have been given a reprieve from an almost certain demise, and are assured to exercise their political clout in the wake of recall elections set for June 5, when automatic due deductions are reinstated, no later than May 31, 2012.

As Frank Castle, AKA The Punisher, in Marvel's Daredevil, Jon Bernthal did such a stellar job that he's just been given his own spinoff show–which will be Marvel's sixth collaboration with Netflix. Bernthal was no stranger to the comic book genre, having done a stint on The Walking Dead. He credits comic book fans as the most “passionate and intelligent audience there is”.
In order to get close to the mindset of Frank Castle, the married-with-children Bernthal forced himself into isolation, as he says, “I really felt that for me, to eliminate the creature comforts, to isolate myself from my family, to really actively engage and be open to a relative level of darkness in my life, I think really serves the character and really was essential to explore.”
Now, with six film projects in the works and the spin-off coming up, Bernthal seems unstoppable. “I'm just fighting the fight,” he says. “If it's a good project and they'll have me, I'm there.”
What first grabbed you about the role of Frank Castle/The Punisher?
I've been totally upfront about this. I don't think that I ever had any real longing or clear conscious aspirations to jump into the whole superhero genre. It was never really something that I pursued. What grabbed me about Frank is that he's the quintessential opposite of that. He has no superpowers. He's unbelievably human. It's humanity that makes him such a force to be reckoned with. He's a man who suffered immeasurable loss. The Frank Castle that we find in Daredevil Season 2 is not a guy who's out there trying to rid Hell's Kitchen of the criminal element. He's a brokenhearted, completely isolated man who's lost his wife and kids. He's reeling, he's filled with shame and remorse and regret and pain, and he's a man on a mission. He's trying to find these people who have taken his heart from him, and he's trying to kill them, as brutal a way as possible. I think that's as sort of old and classic and human a tale as possible. I've said it before, I don't think that I would ever begin to be able to step into these shoes and take on this role if I wasn't a father and a husband myself. To really, really understand what it means to love somebody, to love people more than you love yourself, and to willingly give your life for them in a heartbeat. Until you really understand that, I don't think you can begin to understand what it would be like to lose that love. I just think for me at this time in my life with three young kids and a relatively new family, it was something that really scared me. It's always been a mantra of mine. In art, if it scares you, run to it. That's where you've got to go.
In prepping for the role, you spent time alone away from your family–why did you need to do that?
I think it absolutely deserves an element of immersion. I don't think it would be respectful to the character that so many fans have adored for years, I don't think it would be fair to the members of the American military who have worn the Punisher insignia on their battle armor and have fought and died for our country. I don't think it would be fair to the members of law enforcement that have adopted this character, and the millions of fans it means so much to. For me to be at nightclubs and bars and restaurants and hanging out with my kids and just being a happy guy, and being on my phone, turning up on set, playing pretend, that's not how I work and that's not how I want to work. So shut off the other things, to shut off the comfort, and to shut off the escape and television and things like that, I think that that's part of the job. It's definitely how I worked on with Frank.
Why do you think Netflix makes a good home for Marvel projects?
It's an absolute joy working for Netflix. I love their model. There's no better system to deliver a story. It lets you be incredibly bold with your storytelling. It lets you take huge risks. It lets you risk alienating your audience and abandoning your audience, and then being courageous enough to know that you're going to win them back four episodes down the line, but you know that they don't have to wait four weeks until they get that episode. I think with a character like Frank Castle, it's really important to go all the way. When he has a moment of brutality, to make it fully brutal, and then try to explain what he did with the regret and the remorse and the shame. Let that seep in a couple episodes down the road. But to try to play the brutality and shame at the same time, I think it's not real. I really love the Netflix model, and I think they're really on to something.
“He's a brokenhearted, completely isolated man who's lost his wife and kids. He's reeling, he's filled with shame and remorse,” Bernthal says of his Daredevil character The Punisher Netflix
What are your thoughts on playing a character who uses guns so much, in light of the current debate on gun control?
Look, what I think should happen is I think that one of the most notable things that art can do is hold a mirror to society and make you ask questions. I think that if you're asking a question, then we're doing our job. I think that's the point. I think what's really interesting about Daredevil Season 2, and as far as the issue with guns, and guns in America, and guns in the streets, and guns for justice, and all these things–what's interesting about that is I think that wherever you fall on the gun control debate, I think you can make arguments based on our show that would support either side. I like that. I think that's what we should do. I think that our job is not to give you an answer. I don't think our job is to tell you which way to think. I think our job is to hold a mirror out to reflect society and show both sides of it. That's kind of where I fall. I think that it's a very, very complicated issue and I think if we're successful, we're going to raise those questions.
What's the situation right now with your spinoff?
I'm tremendously excited about it. I look at it as a real joy and a real responsibility and a real honor to play Frank Castle. I feel like he's in my bones now and he's in my heart. I'm ready to keep going with him. As far as what this show's going to be, and what it's going to be about, and when it's going to shoot, and where it's going to shoot and all that, unfortunately I don't know anything. It's kind of part and parcel with the way that Marvel works. Information is definitely on a need to know basis. I am nervous, and I just want to do this character and this world justice.
Internet Lord (and sure, astrophysicist or whatever) Neil deGrasse Tyson is taking his popular StarTalk podcast to National Geographic Channel starting April 20. The newly televised version of the show will follow the podcast's existing format, with Tyson discussing different scientific topics with a variety of cohorts, usually stand-up comics or writers.
PEOPLE caught up with Tyson to talk about making the jump to television, whether science is under attack and if he'll have a band on the show.
How did StarTalk get started?
There are places for people to go who already like science – Discovery Channel, Space.com, there's Science Friday on NPR. But I asked myself, “Suppose you don't know you like science? Or suppose you know that you don't like science. How do you get science to those people?” And I figured the only way I could come up with – and this is in collaboration with the other two creators of the show, Helen Matsos and David Gamble – was, instead of having a journalist be the host and the guest be a scientist, we'd invert the tables, and the host is the scientist, and the guest is most of the time someone who's not a scientist.
Everybody has been touched by science in some way in their lives. So the idea was to bring people hewn from pop culture and explore all the ways science has impacted that person's livelihood. And those people have followings, who've now followed them to a science show, and a whole demographic of people who might not have otherwise taken the energy or time to invest in science, will come and listen to the show, and science is part of that conversation.
You're in a good place for this – you have a following in both the scientific and pop-culture worlds.
That gives me a social currency that enables me to have these conversations in the first place.
Was that ever a goal for you?
Oh, no. My goal is to just sit on a beach somewhere. [Laughs.] I want, like, a palm tree with a wired Internet connection, and I'm good. Let's not talk about “goals.”
Did you ever anticipate your career would take this turn?
I operate as a servant to the public's appetite for science. I don't twist anybody's arm, I don't make people follow me on Twitter or Facebook. Almost every clip of me on YouTube, somebody else posted. And I'm enchanted by this and honored by this, but what it all tells me is that there is an underserved underbelly of pop-culture fans that likes science and wants more of it.
National Geographic recently had a cover story called "The War on Science." Do you put any stock in that argument that science is under attack in the mainstream?
Cosmos aired on a major network. On prime time. On a Sunday night. And it was commercially successful. What's the number-one show on TV? The Big Bang Theory. And yes, though they be caricatures, their banter is derived from fundamentally real science, and they have a Ph.D. physicist as an adviser to the show. And then you look at this year's crop of films – Interstellar, The Imitation Game, The Theory of Everything – these all have major scientific themes.
The fact that Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking? I know how scientists have been portrayed in media – they're people you don't care about, people in lab coats with wiry hair, and they're a little crazy. You don't care if they're married or they have kids, do they love, do they hate? And that character isn't in a position to be winning an Academy Award. But that's changed.
And plus, I wake up in the morning and I say, “I have how many Twitter followers? How did that happen?” All of this is evidence that science is doing well.
“Science under attack,” I think, is the wrong headline. “We forgot how to teach our children” is the right one. The issue is how we teach people how to think. Whether or not we're conscious of this, here's what's actually happening: We see students as these empty vessels, and then we pour knowledge into those empty vessels, and then we send them forth. And in there, no one is trained how to think about information or data or how to interpret or how to bring skepticism to an argument or how to know when someone is not speaking the truth. Science literacy is a kind of inoculation against charlatanism. It allows you to know when someone is full of s—. It empowers you to know when someone else is full of s—, and not everyone wants you to know that about them. So really, the fact that you have people denying science is an education problem.
With StarTalk, who are your talk-show inspirations?
Well, I take more from stand-up comics, really. I have a deep respect for stand-up comedians. For how they think, for how their brains are wired, the power they have to bring comment and criticism to things we all experience and make us laugh. So that's why almost every episode has a comic as my co-host.
Which comics do you like? I know you've had Eugene Mirman on the podcast.
I like Jeff Foxworthy, Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor. I've always liked Sinbad, especially his early work. I liked Elayne Boosler, I'm not sure what happened to her, she seemed to fall off the radar. I like Tig Notaro – that last album where she talked about her cancer diagnosis. And we love the comedians we bring in on the show – Eugene, Chuck Nice, Leanne Lord. The kind of comedy I like isn't “Well, have you heard the one about ?” The kind of comedy I like is people observing cultural and social mores and reacting to them in a way that enlightens you.
Are you planning on keeping the Beastie Boys song?
[Laughs.] Thanks for asking! I love that beat, and we're still gonna keep it for the radio show – the radio show's going to continue, by the way – but we're still in conversation about what the theme will be on TV.
Are you going to have a band?
[Laughs.] Nah, the whole “evening talk show” was a little overplayed with the press release. I'm not coming out with a band or a curtain or anything – we're just doing the radio show with a little window dressing. But I'm pretty sure it's the first science talk show on television, and it's the first talk show for National Geographic. But, you know, the radio show has 3 million downloads a month. If it doesn't work, I'll just go back to the podcast! If this doesn't work, we're still cool! [Laughs.]
StarTalk premieres April 20 at 11 p.m. ET on National Geographic Channel.
The latest act in the Cardiff pantomime saw the wicked wizard from the far east, aka Vincent Tan, abused in time- honoured fashion by the audience and turn to his principal boy to appease them.
Tan brought the curtain down on Malky Mackay's management on Friday and needs to come up with a new leading man quickly if the show is not to fold in the West End that is the Premier League and return to the Championship provinces.
Cardiff's Malaysian owner is no Baron Hardup and promised that Mackay's successor will not have Buttons to work with but the first audition for the role ended badly when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the first choice, decided the part was not for him.
Tan sent his Turkish chairman, Mehmet Dalman, to speak after the match. In a knockabout routine that was more Ken Dodd than Kenwright, Dalman said yes, he had spoken to Solskjaer many times – in his Manchester United days. So had he spoken to him recently? "I might have." Was he a runner? "He always ran well for United." When pressed for a sensible answer, Dalman admitted he had only one candidate in mind, which we can safely assume was Solskjaer, but said David Kerslake, formerly Mackay's assistant, would remain in charge on a temporary basis for Wednesday's onerous trip to Arsenal.
With Solskjaer out of the equation it is back to the drawing board, with Cardiff looking for a young thruster full of ambition. Whether these are the right qualities is open to question, with a cogent, persuasive case to be made for an old sweat who has been through relegation battles before and has successfully established a promoted club in the Premier League – someone like Tony Pulis perhaps, who did it at Stoke and is breathing new life into a previously moribund Crystal Palace.
Pulis, a Welshman from Newport, a few miles down the M4 from Cardiff, has been through hard times and emerged in credit. He was out of work and available when Tan first reached the conclusion that Mackay should go but, while the money man procrastinated, Palace nipped in.
Kerslake, who is not a contender for the job, admitted his players were "devastated" by Saturday's result, which "felt like a defeat". Cardiff dominated their bottom-of-the-table opponents for an hour, deservedly leading 2-0, only to go into defensive mode too early and concede twice between the 83rd minute and the end. They remain two points clear of the bottom three but could ill afford to drop two with a daunting January to come. After Arsenal at the Emirates on New Year's Day they play Newcastle away in the FA Cup, then West Ham at home followed by Manchester City and Manchester United, both away.
Given such a testing sequence it was essential they made the most of Sunderland's visit and for most of the match it seemed they would do so. Flying out of the traps, they seized the initiative and Jordon Mutch should have scored with a header even before he did so in the sixth minute with a rasping drive from the 18-yard line. Craig Noone, a quick winger too often ignored this season, had the beating of Andrea Dossena and turned the Sunderland defence time and again. But Cardiff failed to do justice to his penetrative supply work and it was the 58th minute before they increased their lead, Mutch setting up Fraizer Campbell for a routine finish against his old club.
It was a winning position but two defensively minded substitutions, which saw Noone and Kim replaced by Don Cowie and Aron Gunnarsson, succeeded only in surrendering the initiative and Sunderland were able to take punitive advantage. Never-say-die spirit personified, they pulled one goal back through Steven Fletcher, then gained real reward in the fifth minute of added time when another substitute, Jack Colback, equalised with a deflected shot.
Justifiably proud of the character shown by his players, Gus Poyet said: "I really do feel we are going to be in the Premier League again next season." Cardiff too? Only if Dalman, the Tommy Cooper of chairmen, can pull a rabbit from his fez.
Man of the match Jordon Mutch (Cardiff City)
For months we've been told that the Clinton Foundation, and it's various subsidiaries, were simple, innocent "charitable" organizations, despite the mountain of WikiLeaks evidence suggesting rampant pay-to-play scandals surrounding a uranium deal with Russia and earthquake recovery efforts in Haiti, among others. Well, if that is, in fact, true perhaps the Clintons could explain why wealthy foreign governments, like Australia and Norway, are suddenly slashing their contributions just as Hillary's schedule has been freed up to focus exclusively on her charity work. Surely, these foreign governments weren't just contributing to the Clinton Foundation in hopes of currying favor with the future President of the United States, were they? Can't be, only an useless, "alt-right," Putin-progranda-pushing, fake news source could possibly draw such a conclusion.
Alas, no matter the cause, according to news.com.au, the fact is that after contributing $88mm to the Clinton Foundation, and its various affiliates, over the past 10 years the country of Australia has decided to cease future donations to the foundation just weeks after Hillary's stunning loss on November 4th.
And just like that, 2 out of the 3 largest foreign contributors to the Clinton Foundation are gone with Saudia Arabia being the last remaining $10-$25mm donor that hasn't explicitly cut ties or massively scaled by contributions.
News.com.au confirmed Australia's decision to cut future donations to the Clinton Foundation earlier today. When asked why donations were being cut off now, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official simply said that the Clinton Foundation has “a proven track record” in helping developing countries. While that sounds nice, doesn't it seem counterintuitive that these countries would pull their funding just as Hillary has been freed up to spend 100% of her time helping people in developing countries?
Australia has finally ceased pouring millions of dollars into accounts linked to Hillary Clinton's charities. Which begs the question: Why were we donating to them in the first place? The federal government confirmed to news.com.au it has not renewed any of its partnerships with the scandal-plagued Clinton Foundation, effectively ending 10 years of taxpayer-funded contributions worth more than $88 million. News.com.au approached the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for comment about how much was donated and why the Clinton Foundation was chosen as a recipient. A DFAT spokeswoman said all funding is used “solely for agreed development projects” and Clinton charities have “a proven track record” in helping developing countries.
Of course it's only fitting that Australia's Prime Minister is none other than Malcolm Turnbull, the former Chairman of Goldman Sachs Australia. Goldman Sachs only pays for results Madam Secretary.
Meanwhile, this new comes just after the Norwegian newspaper Hegnar pointed out earlier this week that Norway is expected to slash their contributions to the Clinton Foundation by 87% now that Hillary has lost the presidency. After contributing roughly $5mm per year to the Clinton Foundation between 2007 - 2013, the Norwegian government decided to boost their donations to ~$15mm and ~$21mm in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Ironically, that boost in contributions corresponded with Hillary's decision to run for President in 2016...but we're sure it was just a coincidence. That said, it is fairly interesting that, since Hillary's loss, Norway, like Australia, also decided to scale back their contributions by 87% in 2017...things that make you go "hmm".
After a record contribution from Norway to the disputed Clinton Foundation before the election year, is the contribution now in freefall. Financial newspaper can tell that next year's contribution is down 83 percent from the peak year of 2015. For 2016, the planned payments to Clinton Health Access Initiative totaling 35.9 million kroner, writes communications advisor Guri Solberg at the Foreign Ministry, in an email to Finance newspaper. It is one-fifth of last year's contribution, when nominating election campaign before the US primaries was in full swing, and the Clinton Foundation came under the spotlight in the US press. According to Finance newspaper lay the annual Norwegian contribution of NOK 40 million on average from 2007 to 2013. In 2014, the contribution more than tripled, to 129 million. And in 2015 they increased to 174 million. The money has gone to two of the Foundation's programs, primarily Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), but also the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI). For 2017 it is planned payments to Clinton Health Access Initiative 23 million, Solberg wrote in an email to Finance newspaper. It is further down 36 percent from the current year. By comparison, ran this program 169 million in 2015.
But, no doubt these are just more "plumes of smoke" for which Hillary has absolutely no explanation.
John Krahn is a big guy. He's so big, he might be too big.
For a football lineman, that's saying something.
The high school senior is 7 feet and 440 pounds -- both insane measurables. For context, he's taller than any lineman currently playing in the NFL.
And Krahn has always been a big guy, sometimes to his detriment. According to USA Today, Krahn was kept out of youth football for several years because he exceeded the league weight limits. A player of his size posed a threat to other players.
When the Riverside, California, youth finally got a chance to play middle school football, he started doing damage immediately -- but not in the way you'd hope. In his first football practice, he broke one of his teammate's arms by falling on top of him," according to a feature by The Press-Enterprise.
So it's been an odd ascent for Krahn. But now, his size and physical potential are drawing attention from Division I college football programs.
There's only one more hurdle to clear: Even now, at the college level, coaches want the ML King High defensive tackle to downsize.
"We had Division I coaches on site [at a summer camp] that said they'd consider offering him if he lost some weight," said Jimmy Thomas of USA Football, according to MaxPreps. "They think he could be a force at a lighter weight."
At the moment, Krahn is seen as a raw talent in need of refinement. His footwork needs improvement, and losing weight should improve his agility.
Between his need to lose weight and his rough skill set, Krahn could ultimately land with a junior college, where he can fine-tune his skills and possibly open doors to the Division I level later in his career.
Whatever happens, his size will be an asset for Krahn. Beyond football, he wants to become a police officer someday.
Law enforcement, with that body? He'll be a natural.
The Ford administration says waste-cutting is its motive for moving to scrap 21 citizen-dominated committees that advise council on everything from cycling to pedestrians to aboriginal affairs. But critics charged Wednesday that axing the committees — which are made up of volunteers, including some councillors, and have no budget — is an undemocratic move meant to shut out anyone with opposing views.

Councillor Adam Vaughan said the Ford administration just isn't interested in consulting some sectors of the community. “They only want to talk to some people. They only want some of the information, not all of it,” Vaughan said. “What they're trying to do here is cut off access to city hall for a significant number of people, and it's unacceptable.” A staff review requested by Mayor Rob Ford led to recommendations to terminate 10 committees outright, citing them as redundant, dormant or having completed their mandates.

A further 11 committees would be disbanded without reason, but bureaucrats would consider whether to use other civic engagement methods such as town halls or social media. The recommendations from city manager Joe Pennachetti are outlined in a report going to next week's meeting of the executive committee, chaired by Ford. Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday said the advisory committees are too expensive for a city facing a $774 million deficit in next year's budget. “It's gotten out of control,” Holyday said. “We've got to start cutting costs any way we can that's reasonable.” The report itself says scrapping the committees would have no financial impact.
“There'll be savings, believe me,” Holyday said. “The savings is going to be in staff time, and that can be enormous. It might be hard to measure, but there's no way that you set up all these groups in place and they just sit out there and float by themselves.” Holyday also said he supports scrapping committees because they “get too large and unwieldy.”

“You're getting advice from too many places and everybody's got their own, I guess, personal agenda . . . looking out for whatever they want to look out for,” he said. Councillor Janet Davis, who has served on the tenant defence sub-committee, said she sees no savings from ending the body, which advised council on which tenant groups should get grants to help them fight landlords on maintenance and rent issues. “I asked the mayor specifically, ‘Why are you cutting the tenant defence committee?' and he said it costs too much money,” Davis said. “The committee costs virtually nothing.” The eight councillors on the subcommittee don't get paid extra and there are no travel, food or accommodation expenses, Davis said. Only two advisory committees would escape the axe: the film and television committee and a community grants appeal committee. The mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment. Councillor Mike Layton said the move is shortsighted. “These are advisory bodies that come and give the city advice about what we should do around those specific issues and all are proposed to be taken away,” he said. “It's wild. I was preparing a letter asking to be on the cycling committee. I now have to revise that to say can you establish the cycling committee.” Layton said the pedestrian committee, for example, recently received an award for its innovative walking strategy, “and now we're scrapping the very committee that helped develop that program. It's unbelievable.” The aboriginal affairs committee is facing the axe at a time when chiefs from across the country are to meet in Toronto next near, said Councillor Adam Vaughan. “That committee has helped advise us on policing, housing and children's services, and we have the Assembly of First Nations coming next year, which is a huge political event. And here we are cutting off our relationship to the First Nations communities.” Vaughan said there's nothing particularly controversial about the committee mandates. “It's cyclists coming to tell us where our strengths and weaknesses are around cycling, it's pedestrians talking about mobility issues on sidewalks, it's a whole series of stuff. “On children's services, it brings together the school board, the daycare community, and the province to have a forum about children's issues and make sure city policy is as strong as it can be.”

“I don't see anything that looks that compelling,” said Linley Gwennap, a chip analyst at the Linley Group. “It doesn't seem like something all that new, and, if it is, they are not getting far with it.”
As he unveiled the iPad last week, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, discussed the A4 with his customary hyperbolic flair. He heralded it as “the most advanced chip” Apple had ever used and said it was crucial to the iPad's speed, reliability and 10-hour battery life.
“We have an incredible group that does custom silicon at Apple,” Mr. Jobs said, adding that the A4 has “everything in this one chip, and it screams.” Apple declined to discuss details of the chip beyond what it had said publicly.
Apple bought its way into the chip business in 2008, acquiring the 150-employee start-up PA Semi. That company had been working on chips that could handle large volumes of data while consuming very low amounts of power.
PA Semi's engineers, most of them veterans from other chip companies in Silicon Valley, had just the type of expertise that a company making music players, laptops and phones would want.

Over all, the A4-powered iPad's battery life and speed seem similar to those of computers running on competing chips. A wave of tiny laptops known as smartbooks will arrive shortly after the iPad starts selling in March, running at the same speed as the iPad while offering up to 16 hours of battery life when playing video. These will run on chips by Nvidia and Qualcomm that have designs reminiscent of the A4.
Apple has a history of trying to ostentatiously best the competition. It promoted the MacBook Air, introduced in 2008, as the thinnest laptop ever. By building the A4 into the iPad, Apple appears to have bought a small lead over rivals — or at least kept pace with them — in this emerging class of mobile devices.
“From what we have seen so far, Apple's product seems to stack up evenly with the competition,” said Dean McCarron, a chip analyst with Mercury Research. “Clearly, Apple is using their own metric for whatever ‘best' is.” Apple's laptops and desktops run on Intel chips, while Samsung has been selling Apple the primary chips for the iPhone. Analysts believe Samsung is actually manufacturing the A4 as well, using a common industry design for the core of the chip, while Apple has tweaked other parts of the processor package to suit its needs.

Apple's other mobile devices like the iPhone and iPod Touch could conceivably all run on Apple-designed chips someday. Analysts point out that it often takes about two years for chip designers to create something from scratch, test it and have a finished product arrive from a factory.
Some of the chip engineers Apple gained in its purchase of PA Semi appear to have already left the company. According to partial records on the job networking site LinkedIn, at least half a dozen former PA Semi engineers have left Apple and turned up at a start-up called Agnilux, based in San Jose. The company was co-founded by one of PA's leading system architects, Mark Hayter.
Neither Mr. Hayter nor other onetime PA workers who left Apple for Agnilux were willing to discuss either company's plans. According to two people with knowledge of the two companies, who were unwilling to be named because the matter is delicate, some PA engineers left Apple a few months after the acquisition because they were given grants of Apple stock at an unattractive price.
Apple still appears committed to its chip plans. Even the analysts who dismiss the A4 as a “me too” product say Apple's decision to give it a name and discuss it so publicly indicates that custom chips are a priority.
“This is somewhere where Apple thinks it can make a unique product, and it definitely signals a new direction for them,” said Nathan Brookwood, a chip analyst at Insight 64.
According to some estimates, 550 women from across Europe have gone to Iraq and Syria to marry IS fighters. Last year at least three young Australian women departed for the front. The authorities have rightly warned that women in radicalised families are at risk of being sent to IS-controlled areas and forced into sex slavery.
But most women go because they're determined to go. Once there, the brides' social media feeds exhibit what Katherine Brown, Defence Studies lecturer at King's College London, describes, with typical British understatement, as "a combination of violence and domesticity that many find jarring". She refers to images posted from Raqqa, Syria, where British women have set up an all-female police brigade. The women carry AK47s, wear suicide belts and hold severed heads. They cook Nutella pancakes, gossip over coffee, do housework and mothering.
For the men, the battlefields of Syria and Iraq are perhaps a kind of Boy's Own adventure with a mediaeval twist. In the caliphate, these young men, no longer castrated by demands for gender equality, can live their ideal of masculinity – raping and decapitating and avenging the faith.
But what of these women, many of them born or at least bred in the West? Like the teenage runaways in the popular imagination, they are still chasing the bad boys. Yet instead of chasing freedom, they're fetishising subjugation; not even for some futuristic cult that promises utopia, but for a religious mania that promises apocalypse.
What did we do wrong with these children? The mother in me can't help asking, even though I refute the implication the West is to blame. Ross Frenett, of the London-based Institute of Strategic Dialogue, says "an awful lot" of extremists, including jihadi brides, are well-adjusted and come from well-off backgrounds. "They are just looking for a sense of belonging." Aren't we all? Brown of King's College says some French jihadi brides cited restrictions on the burqa as their main gripe against home. One Dutch bride bemoaned that Islamic law would never come to Europe. It's not about us, it's about them.
Miami Twp. agreed to pay $100,000 to the family of the girl who was naked when she was hosed down by former deputy police chief John DiPietro, according to records obtained by the Dayton Daily News.
In exchange, the family agreed not to sue the township or its current or former employees. The money will come from the township's insurance provider.
A June 25 settlement agreement obtained Monday by the Dayton Daily News shows that the girl's family unconditionally releases the township and all current and former employees of any “liability, claims demands, controversies, actions, causes of action, and suits at law” stemming from the July 12, 2012 arrest and pepper-spraying of a 17-year-old girl who was brought to Miami Twp. headquarters.
“The township acted appropriately to an unfortunate situation,” Miami Twp. Board of Trustees President Mike Nolan said in a prepared release. “We now consider the matter resolved and have moved forward.”
The girl was decontaminated multiple times to counteract the effects of the pepper spray, the final time happening as she stripped naked as DiPietro held a water hose in the police department's sally port. DiPietro admitted to taking a photo of a tattoo on the girl's back and sending it to a friend, but the photo was not taken when the girl was naked.
DiPietro later was fired by the township's Board of Trustees for cause after finding him guilty of several violations of the township's professional code. DiPietro's appeal of his dismissal is pending in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court.
The possible claims the agreement states the township is released from include: Negligent supervision; infringement of civil/constitutional rights; failure to train; acquiescence in unconstitutional conduct; maintenance of an unconstitutional custom, policy or practice; failure to discipline; negligent supervision; unreasonable search; arrest without probable cause; false arrest; false imprisonment or detention; unlawful arrest; malicious prosecution; use of excessive force; right to privacy; and attorney fees and costs.
According to the document, both sides agreed not to comment on the specifics of the four-page agreement.
A broadcast of "The Green Line," a weekly radio show by the U.S. Border Patrol agents' union that is sponsored by the conservative Breitbart News, in Solana Beach, California, February 21, 2017.
Breitbart's popularity has tanked the past month by its own standard, Vanity Fair reported on Sunday.
Using the same analytics by Alexa.com used by Breitbart News, the alt-right website formerly headed by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, Vanity Fair showed its ranking has plunged from 29th in February to 281st place, as of May 26.
In November, Breitbart CEO Larry Solov had predicted, “While several publishers have enjoyed an uptick in traffic due to election coverage, we are proud to have built a massive and deeply-rooted community that will remain long after the election cycle fades.” Just two months later, in November, Breitbart boasted: “With over two billion pageviews generated in 2016 and 45 million unique monthly visitors, Breitbart News has now surpassed Fox News (#47), Huffington Post (#50), Washington Post (#53), and Buzzfeed (#64) in traffic.”
Although interpreting analytics at face value is tricky business, Vanity Fair theorizes that Breitbart has stumbled in the transition from being an outsider constantly attacking the Democrats and Washington to defending the missteps of the Republican-controlled White House and Capitol Hill.
“If you're anti-Trump, there's never been a better time to read news. It's like Christmas every morning,” an editor at a conservative media outlet told Vanity Fair. “So every time you open the newspaper or open Twitter or turn on Facebook, you get to enjoy the fact that there are a lot of other people who don't like Trump and there are a lot of news stories that show Trump in a negative light. Whereas if you're Breitbart, you're scrambling to explain or defend or continue to back the guy that you backed throughout the election. And eventually, if your posture continues to just simply be reactive and trying to explain away things that are happening to or by the president, I think people slowly become sort of disheartened by politics.”
Vanity Fair pointed out that Breitbart's traffic pattern, which spiked in December, remained fairly stable, and then crashed in May, coincided with its decisions to enable and then disable Alexa's certified-results feature, as noted by an Alexa customer representative. Use of this service would thus have created an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of site traffic, Vanity Fair explained.
Even so, Breitbart had no problem boasting of its popularity when the data played in its favor. Now that the comparison is back to apples-to-apples, it woefully trails the Washington Post (41st), Buzzfeed (50th), Huffington Post (60th) and Fox News (64th), remaining conspicuously silent about its current ranking.

Match Up:
The Canadiens (8-5-0) are in Minnesota on Friday to face the Wild (6-4-3) to kick off their second straight set of back-to-back games. The game starts at 8:00 Eastern and can be seen on RDS.
This is the first of two meetings between the Habs and the Wild, Minnesota will be in Montreal later in the month to complete the series. The last time these teams met, the Habs squandered a 4-1 lead but managed a 5-4 shootout victory against a Wild team that had yet to sign Zach Parise or Ryan Suter.
What to Watch:
The trio of Tomas Plekanec, Brian Gionta and Michael Bournival have combined for 21 points in the last 7 games and have scored 10 of the 17 Habs goals in that span. Meanwhile, PK Subban has been held pointless in his last 4, although he's still tied for most points among defensemen with 11 on the season.
Jason Pominville, picked up from the Sabres at the trade deadline last season, leads the Wild with 7 goals on the year. Rookie Matt Dumba has played 9 NHL games this season, meaning it's decision time for the Wild. The team needs to decide if they want to burn a year off his NHL contract or send Dumba back down to the minors. Coach Mike Yeo has already confirmed Dumba won't be in the lineup on Friday.
What's at Stake:
The Canadiens are one of four teams with 16 points in the Atlantic division heading into Friday's action. The Habs, Wings, Lightning and Bruins are all chasing the Maple Leafs early in the season, the Leafs are up to 20 points in their 14 games.
Who's Out:
George Parros will make his return to the lineup Friday night and Max Pacioretty (hamstring) is already traveling with the team, although he won't see action in Minnesota. That still leaves Brandon Prust (upper body), Daniel Briere (concussion), Travis Moen (face), Alexei Emelin (knee) and Davis Drewiske (shoulder) in the clinic.
Keith Ballard (head) could return to the Wild lineup Friday, so could forward Charlie Coyle. That leaves Jonas Brodin (face) and Mike Rupp (knee) on the sidelines.
What Else:
The Canadiens announced Thursday that the team had re-signed defenseman Alexei Emelin to a 4-year deal. While the terms were not disclosed, the deal is reportedly worth 4.1 million per year. Emelin led the Habs in hits last year despite missing 10 of 48 games in the shortened season.

Since the Russian-Ukrainian conflict began, the Kremlin has persistently tried to expand its control over Belarus, a process that has had quite the opposite effect as Belarusian government policy became more independent in 2014-2015.
Since the Russian-Ukrainian conflict began, the Kremlin has persistently tried to expand its control over Belarus, a process that has had quite the opposite effect as Belarusian government policy became more independent in 2014-2015.
There has always existed a paradox in the simultaneous contingence and estrangement in Belarusian-Russian relations.
Estrangement looks the stronger of the two today, evidenced by the decrease in Belarus' military dependence on Russia and its refusal to allow the establishment of a Russian military base on its territory; the reduction in the Russian economy's role in Belarus; discrepancies in the foreign policy and media spheres; and conflicts between the political elites of both countries.
These are some of the conclusions found in a new analytical paper Belarus-Russia Relations after the Ukraine Conflict released by the Ostrogorski Centre today.
Background
This paper examines the integration/disintegration tendencies in Belarus-Russia relations since November 2013, when protests started in Ukraine. The ensuing Euromaidan, annexation of Crimea, and war in the Donbass have considerably altered European politics, including relations between Minsk and Moscow.
Despite close relations and the formal joint construction of the Union State, which also provides for integration processes, Belarus and Russia are becoming estranged from each other, in numerous ways. There are two reasons for this.
Lukashenka has probably never before taken so seriously the possibility of a Russian military operation inside Belarus Read more
First, the Kremlin's policy towards Ukraine led to a re-thinking inside Belarusian authoritative circles of the possible steps that Russia could take with regard to Belarus. Alexander Lukashenka has probably never before taken so seriously the possibility of a Russian military operation inside Belarus as he did when he claimed in May 2015 that the Belarusian army needs to be so strong that it is capable of “being thrown from Brest to Vitebsk in half a night to strike a blow”.
Secondly, the decline of the Russian economy lessens the Kremlin's role as guarantor of Belarus' well-being. In the conditions of slumping prices, shrinking of the domestic market, and declining GDP growth and forex reserves in Russia, diversification of the Belarusian economy has transformed from wishful thinking into a vital necessity.
Military disintegration: how to say “no” to your ally
Military cooperation has always been the “holy cow” of Belarusian-Russian integration, and the basis for journalists' and Western experts' statements presuming that the Belarusian army remains a part of the Russian one.
One of the grounds for such a presumption is the existence of the Integrated Regional Antiaircraft Defense System which, according to the Russian military, started functioning in 2016. The agreement on its creation was signed back in 2009 and in fact brought nothing new to Russian-Belarusian military cooperation. It looks likely that announcing the establishment of an antiaircraft defense system was aimed at making milder Belarus' refusal to place a Russian military air base on its territory.
The refusal to create the airbase reflects a broader trend – i.e. Belarus' attempts to reduce its military dependence on Russia. The presence of so many Belarusian military personnel in Russia has always ensured that there is a mental connection between the Belarusian and the Russian armies – it is hard to find any top Belarusian military official who has not studied in Russia.
However, the number of Belarusian military cadets at the Russian military's higher educational establishments is decreasing: last academic year there were 447, this year only 374.
The joint Shield of the Union exercises in 2015 gathered 1.5 times fewer military personnel than the 2011 Shield of the Union or West-2013 exercises (i.e. 8,000 participants compared with 12,000). While military exercises seemed all but impossible without Russia before, today the Belarusian paratroopers practice with the Chinese every year.
Although the scope of such training exercises looks miserly in comparison with the exercises with Russia, it shows Belarus' desire to find new partners.
China, in general, has become a noticeable partner for Belarus. This is most clearly seen in the joint development of weapons systems by Minsk and Beijing, the multiple launch rocket system fire Polonaise being an example.
Failure of the Eurasian Economic Union and economic cooperation
In many ways, Russia's economic decay is responsible for the fact that in only its first year of existence, the Eurasian Economic Union's (EEU) became a failure for Belarus.
First, the integration project inherited practically all the tariffs (about 600) that existed in the Customs Union. Due to such mechanisms, about two third of goods and services have been withdrawn from the common market of the EEU. Secondly, economic interaction between the countries has reduced. According to data provided by the Eurasian Economic Commission, the trade turnover of Belarusian goods with the EU countries in 2015 was only 74.8 % of that in 2014.
Thirdly, although Belarus has introduced unpopular measures like increasing fees for the import of cars, the regulations of the economic union serve Russia's interests, as evidenced by the continuing economic wars. Fourthly, the importance of oil and gas, which were the key motivators for Belarus to join the EEU, have fallen sharply
Discrepancies in foreign policy
Russia's aggressive foreign policy and economic decline have become one of the most important motivators for the Belarusian authorities to normalise relations with the West. Data provided by the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies (BISS) shows that since 2013 Belarus has intensified its relations with the European Union, and today contacts with the EU outnumber those with Russia.
The BISS data reflects the fact that Belarus started normalising relations with the EU and building up contacts with “developing countries” at the beginning of 2013. This included support for Ukraine's European integration. This shows that the increase in dialogue with the West started not because of Russia' expansionist policy, but for internal reasons.
It is nonetheless indisputable that the activation of Belarusian contacts with the world and deepening discrepancies in the foreign policies of Moscow and Minsk in 2013-2014 were in many respects a product of Russia's foreign policy and economic decline.
It is important to note that Belarus' normalisation of relations with the West is not an attempt at a geopolitical U-turn. So far, neither Belarus on the one side, nor the European Union and the United States on the other, have taken any cardinal steps in the form of big economic projects (Belarus still hasn't even managed to obtain a loan from the International Monetary Fund) and contact in the political and military spheres remains at a low level.
Conclusion
Despite Belarus' lessening dependence on Russia, relations seem unlikely to come to the point of a dramatic breakdown in integration.
First, Belarus remains overdependent on Russia financially – it continues to receive from Russia loans and “subsidies” – i.e. discounts for oil and gas and access to the common market. Furthermore, it remains highly important to Lukashenka that Russia acknowledges the results of the presidential elections in Belarus. Secondly, Belarus remains an important country in Europe for Russia. Therefore, the Kremlin won't allow the total disintegration of the two countries' relationship.
Nonetheless, the process of estrangement will continue further, and this is also connected with the generational changes inside the societies. The number of Belarusians who once lived in the same state as Russia – the USSR – is steadily decreasing and the quantity of people who identify themselves as ethnically Russian is reducing. Also a new nomenclature elite is emerging, interest in Belarusian culture is reviving, and young people are becoming more open to the world.
And the last, but important change: a political class that is accustomed to sovereign power, in which decisions are taken independently, has formed in Belarus.

When a foreign place name, or toponym, occurs in Chinese text, the problem arises of spelling it in Chinese characters, given the limited phonetics and restrictive phonology of Mandarin Chinese, and the possible meaning of those characters when treated as Chinese words. For example:
"London Heathrow Airport" is usually rendered in Chinese text as 倫敦希斯路機場 (Lúndūn Xīsīlù Jīchǎng), with the English pronunciation of 'London' being fairly accurate, and of 'Heathrow' being less accurate: in Chinese literally this means "kinship, honest" (for London), "hope/rare, given/this, road" (for Heathrow), "aircraft, field", with the last syllable of "Heathrow" rendered as "lu" although the more accurate "lo" and "lou" are known Chinese words. However, the Cantonese pronunciation of 希斯路 (Hei1si1lou6) is much closer to "Heathrow".
Names of foreign nations are sometimes shortened to their first character when used in compounds. For example, the name for Russia in Chinese is 俄罗斯 (Éluósī), but the name of the Russian language is 俄语 (Éyǔ), anything Russian-style is 俄式 (Éshì), and the Russian military is 俄军 (Éjūn).
For toponyms in Korea, Japan, or Vietnam, the Chinese exonym is often the Chinese pronunciation of the Korean hanja, Japanese kanji, or ancient Vietnamese Chữ Nôm writing of the toponym. In some cases, especially in Japan, the Chinese pronunciation may be completely unlike the native-language pronunciation.
Countries had been founded or had gained independence after 1949 (the year Kuomintang had exiled to Taiwan after losing to the Communist Party) often have different exonyms used in mainland China (PRC) and Taiwan due to differences in official standards resulting from the split in government. This is especially apparent in the names of African nations, many of which have gained independence during the 1960s or later.
Sometimes, if the country's endonym is not internationally well-known, Chinese will transcribe the English name into Chinese characters.
MONTREUX, Switzerland (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday that talks to end the war in Syria should cover all topics of concern to the two sides, including the future of President Bashar al-Assad.

Asked about Assad's future, Wang told reporters: “All issues of concern to the two sides should be put on the table including the one you mentioned just now.”
He said the talks should begin by tackling the easiest issues and then move onto more difficult ones.
“I believe as long as the negotiation continues without disruption, then as the dialogue deepens and trust grows between the two parties, all issues should and can be resolved.”
Syria's government and opposition, meeting for the first time, vented their mutual hostility on Wednesday and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem insisted Assad's future was not in question.
“Nobody in this world has a right to withdraw legitimacy from a president or government ... other than the Syrians themselves,” he said.
Wang said that at start of the peace talks, which begin in earnest on Friday in Geneva, the international community should push the two parties to form a framework setting out the direction and principles of the negotiations.
“They should not at the beginning mire themselves in argumentation or debates on issues where their positions are quite far apart,” he said.
Wang said the two sides should strive to deliver an “early harvest” to build confidence, such as prisoner releases, local ceasefires and humanitarian cooperation. International mediator Lakhdar Brahimi said the two sides might be ready to take such steps.
Asked about the possibility of a U.N. Security Council resolution on humanitarian access, Wang said China was deeply sympathetic to the plight of the 2.4 million Syrian refugees, but it would be wrong to politicize the humanitarian issue.
“At the moment the process of providing humanitarian assistance is smooth, generally speaking,” he said. “I believe there are no difficulties or obstacles that are insurmountable in the process of implementing humanitarian assistance.”

Hezbollah has rejected a Bulgarian investigation that blamed it for a deadly 2012 bus bombing which killed five Israeli tourists and a bus driver.
The Lebanese Shia group's deputy leader said Israel was waging an "international campaign" against Hezbollah that would have no effect.
The Bulgarian report said two suspects were members of Hezbollah's armed wing.
The report prompted Israel's PM to call for Hezbollah to be banned as a terror group by EU nations.
Benjamin Netanyahu said the group had built a "worldwide terrorist" network and was planning attacks in two dozen countries.
Speaking a day after Bulgarian politicians and European police experts said the bomb plot had "obvious links" to Hezbollah, the group's deputy leader strongly denied the accusation.

The Bulgarian report was part of "allegations and incitements and accusations against Hezbollah" driven by Israeli paranoia over Hezbollah's continued military strength in southern Lebanon, he said.
"All these accusations against Hezbollah will have no effect, and do not change the facts," Naim Qassem said, according to Reuters news agency.
"We will not submit to these pressures and we will not change our priorities. Our compass will remain directed towards Israel."
Israel was quick to blame Hezbollah and Iran for the bus bombing in Burgas, on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast.
Tehran has always denied involvement, but Hezbollah has made no comment until now.
In Bulgaria, the country's foreign minister defended the Hezbollah allegation on Wednesday as commentators questioned whether Sofia had enough evidence to be certain of its claim.
"If Bulgaria did not have enough arguments to announce yesterday that the traces in this attack lead to Hezbollah's military wing, we would not have done it," Nikolay Mladenov told a TV station.
Analysts had questioned how Bulgaria's police and government were confident enough of their evidence to make the link to Hezbollah.
The country inevitably "relied heavily on resources from foreign security services" Tihomir Bezlov from the Centre for the Study of Democracy, a Sofia think-tank, told the AFP news agency.
Others described Bulgaria's decision to accuse Hezbollah as part of a wider "game" linked to various conflicts in the Middle East, AFP reported.
This week, the Heartland Institute came to Las Vegas to host what it called “the biggest gathering of global warming skeptics in the world.” Meanwhile, back in the real Heartland, intense storms have flooded the Mississippi River. Rising waters have swamped city streets and submerged thousands of acres of crops in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Twin Cities alone have experienced their wettest year on record; residents have coped with weeks of flood warnings.
Heartland Institute conferencegoers may travel to the desert to deny climate change, but their Midwestern neighbors can't escape reality that easily.
And the reality is our climate is changing is dangerous ways, and pollution from human activity is causing it. A full 97 percent of scientists support this finding, as do experts ranging from the Pentagon to Wall Street. The evidence shows that climate change is happening here and now. In 2012 alone, extreme weather cost our country more than $140 billion; taxpayers picked up nearly $100 billion of the cost of cleanup, according to a Natural Resources Defense Council analysis.
Las Vegas is no stranger to the hazards of global warming. The region is in the midst of the driest 14-year period on record, and Lake Mead — the source of 90 percent of Las Vegas' water supply — hit its lowest level ever this week. Local scientists estimate that temperatures will rise about 2 degrees within 16 years and 4 degrees in 46 years.
The climate skeptics gathering in Las Vegas this week were welcome to enjoy the city's attractions, attend conference sessions and discuss their own opinions. They are not, however, entitled to their own facts.
Fortunately, most Americans are looking the facts squarely in the face. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 70 percent of Americans accept climate change as real, and perhaps more importantly, want their leaders to combat it. This includes a majority of Republicans.
Many of the Americans with whom I speak want to combat climate change because they view it as a moral obligation — they want to protect generations to come. They also want action because, after decades of warnings, climate change is happening right now and doing serious damage.
Thankfully, America is taking action. President Barack Obama has called on the Environmental Protection Agency to do the single most important thing the United States can to confront climate change right now: reduce carbon pollution from power plants.
These plants kick out 40 percent of the country's carbon pollution, making them its single largest source. Right now, the U.S. limits mercury, arsenic, lead and other dangerous pollutants from power plants, but carbon gets a free pass and plants can release as much as of this pollution they want into our air. That's not right.
Finally, our nation is closing the pollution loophole.
The EPA has released the “Clean Power Plan,” which will accelerate the move to a modern, clean energy system to power our future — one that relies on wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. It also means new investment in efficiency, so we can do more with less, save money and make our workers more competitive.
This effort will protect our communities, our air, our water and our health. It also creates an opportunity to drive innovation, investment and jobs. Done right, cutting carbon pollution from power plants could stimulate $52 billion to $121 billion in cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable energy by 2020, and it could save U.S. families and businesses more than $37 billion on their electricity bills by the same year. That's about $100 a year in savings for the average household.
It's no wonder there is broad and growing support for cleaning up carbon pollution. An April poll by Harstad Strategic Research of 11 purple states found that more than two-thirds of people say the EPA should limit carbon pollution from power plants. That includes 53 percent of Republicans, 63 percent of independents and 87 percent of Democrats.
As for the last remaining climate deniers, they had their fun in Las Vegas this week — perhaps the flat earth devotees had similar gatherings in Rome — but their numbers are dwindling rapidly. Despite Heartland's disinformation campaign, America is no longer debating climate change. We're now working to solve it.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro toxicity of clenbuterol and its metabolite 4-amino-3,5-dichlorobenzoic acid. Cytotoxicity and pro-oxidative effect of both compounds were studied on human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW 480. No significant cytotoxic effect of either compound was observed. Results of an Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium did not indicate mutagenic activity of clenbuterol on TA 98 and TA 100 strains, regardless of metabolic activation. Potential mutagenic effects of the highest clenbuterol concentration (2500 ng/ml) were observed on the TA 1535 strain. The obtained results of alkaline comet assay on isolated human lymphocytes suggested that both compounds induced an increase of primary DNA damages in a concentration-dependent manner. 4-ADBA was a slightly more potent inducer of primary DNA damages as compared to clenbuterol. Chromosomal aberration analysis showed that clenbuterol caused a statistically significant increase in the total number of aberrant cells only at the highest concentration tested (3% vs. 0.7% in the negative control). The results of this study might represent a solid frame for designing and planning future studies with both compounds, which should further clarify their mechanisms of action and genotoxic/cytogenetic effects relevant for human risk assessment.

Putting in just one playable female character would “double the work” on Assassin's Creed: Unity, says Ubisoft, apparently believing this is a genuine excuse a rational human being would accept in the face of its stubborn lack of representation of almost half the world's population.
Assassin's Creed: Unity has a new thing, and that thing is co-operative play. Get together with a handful of your buddies and solve the French Revolution, or whatever. One caveat though: all those buddies have to be represented by male avatars.
Yes, that's right: despite putting out a great game with a female assassin protagonist (Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation) and stuffing the multiplayer component of last few core releases with playable females, Ubisoft has now somehow forgotten how to do that and elected not to try to remember.
Speaking to VideoGamer, technical director James Therien said making female characters is just too much work.
“It was on our feature list until not too long ago, but it's a question of focus and production. So we wanted to make sure we had the best experience for the character. A female character means that you have to redo a lot of animation, a lot of costumes. It would have doubled the work on those things,” he said, and I hope he was wiping sweat off his brow as he did it.
“And I mean it's something the team really wanted, but we had to make a decision. It's unfortunate, but it's a reality of game development.”
At this point VideoGamer quite rightly pressed the issue, mentioning the resources at Ubisoft's disposal. Assassin's Creed: Unity, let me remind you, is being worked on by nine development teams and has been in the works for a couple of years.
Therien's response to this perfectly reasonable query was slightly garbled by the incessant roaring assault of noise that is the setting for nearly any E3 interview, and this is probably the only reason why I'm calmly typing away at my keyboard and not actually snapping it over my knee. Here's what VideoGamer heard:
“Again, it's not a question of philosophy or choice in this case at all I don't really [inaudible] it was a question of focus and a question of production,” he said.
“Yes, we have tonnes of resources, but we're putting them into this game, and we have huge teams, nine studios working on this game and we need all of these people to make what we are doing here.”
Ah, yes – writing off the addition of female characters to your game as “too expensive” absolutely doesn't reveal an underlying “philosophy” or “choice” of any sort. (Ubisoft, look, I have always loved you, but since you seem to have become incapable of basic understanding let me just make it clear that the entire preceding sentence was sarcasm.)
In short, Ubisoft has here trotted out a tired, stupid, constantly refuted excuse for why it has perpetuated the cycle of sexism and under-representation in the games industry; we're going to get a bunch of bottom-dwellers telling us how “social justice warrior” we've become as if fighting for a better world were a negative thing; I have cancelled my Unity pre-order; and the universe goes on, uncaring, as my heart breaks just a little bit more with every dragging day. Put that in your box quotes.
Assassin's Creed: Unity is due on PC, PS4 and Xbox One in October. It will make millions and millions of dollars.
When the capital banned skyscrapers in the 1960s, Croydon stepped in with concrete towers and flyovers that made it a byword for urban devastation. Fifty years later, this most unloved suburb may finally be ready to love itself
When David Bowie wanted to summarise all he found dreary, drab and stifling, there was only one place he could turn. “It represented everything I didn't want in my life, everything I wanted to get away from,” he told Q magazine in 1999. “I think it's the most derogatory thing I can say about something: ‘God, it's so fucking Croydon.'”
Bowie, whose personality was shaped in the electrifying cultural climate of Bromley, is not alone. Croydon has such a poor reputation that its name has become a neologism for the self-destruction of a town centre – Croydonisation. The town's inhabitants can exhibit a lowliness bordering on self-loathing. “It could have been worse,” says Bob Stanley, whose band Saint Etienne was formed in Croydon. “In the Domesday Book it was called Crogdene. Imagine if it was still called that.”
Stanley is author of Yeah Yeah Yeah, a history of the pop song, and is currently writing a book about “the magic of Croydon”. He's one of three former Croydonians who are challenging conceptions of their hometown with Croydon Till I Die, a reading event that celebrates the music, literature and architecture of the suburbs.
'In the Domesday Book it was called Crogdene. Imagine if it was still called that?' Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne
It has been organised at Rough Trade East and Croydon's Fairfield Halls by Andy Miller, whose memoir The Year of Reading Dangerously found him fondly recalling his formative years in Croydon's libraries, and wondering why the suburbs rarely featured in the books he read. “I was never embarrassed to come from Croydon, until people told me I should be,” says Miller. “Then I thought, ‘Why the hell should I be?' It feels like people are allowed to feel proud of where they come from, [as long as that's] anywhere other than a particular kind of metropolitan suburb. Society needs a suburban joke and Croydon fits the bill.”
Croydon may have often been seen as boring and narrow-minded, but it received additional disdain for its inhospitable appearance, which inspired John Grindrod, the event's third participant, to write Concretopia, an examination of Britain's postwar brutalist reconstruction. In the 1960s, skyscrapers were banned from central London and Croydon stepped in, building 49 thunderous tower blocks. “It was an ultra-capitalist version of what a town should be,” says Grindrod, who grew up on the estate of New Addington. “It was all about how many big companies they could attract. The impulse was heroic, but not in an edifying way.”
This redevelopment was devastating. It drove a flyover through the town and flattened entire streets. Watching it happen was Jamie Reid, then studying with Malcolm McLaren at Croydon School of Art, where Reid developed the Situationist-inspired collages he later used with the Sex Pistols. In 1972, Reid's publishing outfit, Suburban Press, pictured desolate Croydon with the headline, “Lo! A Monster Is Born”. The experience was encapsulated by the opening titles of Terry and June, a popular 1970s sitcom, which saw the suburban couple wandering around Croydon in a state of dislocated confusion. Things worsened as Croydon lost out to the City and Canary Wharf as a business centre. Croydon's unfulfilled ambition became something else to mock. “When a council can redevelop a whole town like that, it's going to knock your confidence,” says Stanley.

But others embraced Croydon. Stanley always thought the town felt “optimistic”, while Grindrod says: “It was amazingly futuristic. It was so dramatic to arrive in a town on an urban motorway surrounded by towers and huge shopping centres.”
Culturally, Croydon has plenty to shout about. The town played a formative role in punk, thanks to McLaren, Reid and The Damned, and would later spawn dubstep. The film director David Lean was from Croydon, as was actor Peggy Ashcroft and singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl. Author Neil Gaiman went to school there, and his Croydon-set short story How to Talk to Girls at Parties (about “the most dangerous place in the universe”) will soon be made into a film. “Suburbs like Croydon are where so many interesting things, certainly in pop culture, take place,” says Miller. The dislocation and anger of punk and dubstep partly reflect Croydon's alienating landscape. Judge Dredd co-creator Carlos Ezquerra lived in Croydon during the 1970s; one wonders how much the city inspired the feuding tower blocks and deadly subways of Mega-City One.
Croydon also provided opportunities for cultural exploration. Fairfield Halls, built in 1962 as a smaller version of Royal Festival Hall, brought bands like Kraftwerk, T. rex and Pink Floyd to the suburbs, until the provincial circuit went into decline. “In the 70s, it hosted Sparks and Kraftwerk, and by the 90s it was Basil Brush,” says Stanley. “You can trace the cultural decline of Croydon in the headline acts of Fairfield Halls.”
For Stanley, pop culture hinged around Beano's, the biggest secondhand record shop in England until its closure in 2009. There, he pursued musical interests that led him to form Saint Etienne with Pete Wiggs. The band were proud Croydonians, but they were almost alone in that. “When you think about musicians from Croydon, it's hard to get past Captain Sensible,” says Stanley. “Nobody else admits they came from here because it's so uncool.”
Croydon came to be seen as a place where nothing happened, and little was done to challenge this perception. In 2011, the Conservative council slashed the arts budget, flogging ceramics from a local museum, closing the arthouse David Lean Cinema (which they ran, and is only alive again thanks to a campaign by volunteers) and scrapping a local music festival.

Croydon was then hit by the riots of August 2011: shops burned and one man was killed. Months later, the Allders department store closed, and the town's major employer, Nestlé, moved to Crawley, leaving huge empty towers. This was the town's nadir. “So much is undeveloped,” says Miller. “It's urban deprivation in the suburbs.”
Things are slowly changing. As well as a new Labour council that has reinvested in the arts, there is a huge £5.25bn redevelopment plan. Jo Negrini, the council's executive director of redevelopment, jokingly said “third time lucky” in reference to previous failed masterplans – but insisted that this time the regeneration is for real. Around 30 blocks are being built or converted, as the council attempts to transform redundant offices into high-value residential properties and attract new firms: 170 start-ups are set to occupy one tower called Tech City. And there's a new shopping centre from Westfield and Hammerson to replace the ageing Whitgift Centre. “It's a real indicator of the market,” says Negrini. “People are saying if Westfield will invest, there must be something going on.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pete Wiggs, Sarah Cracknell and Bob Stanley of St Etienne. Photograph: Karen Robinson
The eye-watering £5.25bn figure is the combined cost of private investment and public spending: some money is coming from the Mayor's Regeneration Fund, some from the council itself, and some from corporations, including the £1.5bn that Westfield is pouring into the enormous shopping centre. The council wants to partly cover its costs by getting devolved powers that would let it raise local taxes on new developments – something that has yet to happen.
Joanna Rowelle is associate director of Arup, one of several firms involved in the redevelopment. She likens Croydon to Stratford before the Olympics. “London is growing, so we are looking for places that look like a good opportunity, and Croydon is well located for that,” she says. It's on a trainline linking the tech clusters of Brighton and Farringdon, she notes, and will also likely benefit from the gentrification of London, which is forcing the middle classes back into the suburbs they thought they had escaped.
Local residents, like Sarah Wickens, are watching and waiting. “The snobbery really annoys me,” she says. “But it's true that the town really doesn't make the most of itself.” Wickens is one of several locals hoping to stimulate Croydon's cultural scene: she co-organised Croydon Fun Palace, an alternative arts and science fair in October 2014. Other new cultural initiatives in Croydon include an arts space in Matthews Yard, featuring a gallery and theatre, and Rise Gallery, which has brought contemporary art to the bedraggled St George's Walk shopping centre.
Even New Addington, the troubled estate outside of Croydon, is getting some much-needed attention. When Grindrod lived there, it was the sort of place the other Croydonians looked down on. “It felt like it was miles from anywhere, up on this hill,” he says. “You could take the 130 bus to Croydon and it took an hour. It's only later I realised it was in zone five.” Now, New Addington has benefited from the attention of Turner prize-nominated architecture collective Assemble. Funded by the post-riot Outer London Fund, Assemble were appointed designers-in-residence and got to work in the market square: a concrete space they animated with a tea dance, parade, sessions and cake decorating that involved all spheres of the community. They then made physical changes – a stage, skateboard ramps, new positions for market traders – which have been widely praised and achieved a nomination for the New London Architecture's 2013 award for best public space.

“It's a slow process,” says Wickens. “There are exciting things happening, but it just doesn't feel like it's quite coming together after the cuts. There are also questions about the role of developers, which will be huge in the next few years.” In particular, she worries the demolition of the Whitgift Centre is the beginning of the end for Croydon's divisive but eye-catching concrete townscape – which gives the town both its awkward reputation and its aura of uniqueness.
On this, Negrini is reassuring. “There are some great examples of 60s architecture – and there's some crap stuff. There are treasures we want to maintain, like Lunar House and Apollo House [both by Centre Point architect Richard Seifert]. We don't want to bulldoze everything like we did in the 60s – we want to embrace the legacy of this place. We've already done that with the conservation area of the old town, but the 60s stuff is just important.” The council is also organising a music festival and refurbishing Fairfield Halls. “There is a real issue of public perception of Croydon,” she says. “We are very keen on changing those perceptions, and culture has a big impact on regeneration.”

Turning Croydon into a place that David Bowie can talk about without sniggering will be difficult. Stanley hopes that, whatever happens, Croydon's strange spirit will survive. “It's a typical suburb, but it's also like nowhere else I know – Terry and June and Jamie Reid at the same time,” he says. “It's that mix that's so fascinating.”
But not fascinating enough for him to live there. Despite their affection for the town, neither Stanley, Grindrod nor Miller are residents, though Miller insists he remains one in spirit. “I'm like the Sean Connery of Croydon – I don't live there any more, but I am fiercely proud of it. What I want to tell people at Rough Trade East is: do you know what Croydon is? It's where you came from before you went to events like this. It's where most people live.”
Croydon Till I Die is at Rough Trade East, London, on 28 May and at Fairfield Halls, Croydon, on 11 June
After seven years of work, scientists have created an "equilibrium gel." Soon, it could be in everything from nanotech to medicinal drugs.
It doesn't matter if we're born into high society or into humble circumstances. It doesn't matter if we're good or evil. It doesn't matter what we do, or where we go. At some point in our lives, we will all be unfortunate enough to eat some jell-o. Yes, it's always bad. Yes, even if it's lime. Yes, especially if there are marshmallows suspended in it. What kind of sicko are you?
Advertisement
The point is, many of us will have taken part in making the jell-o we eat, and so have seen gel-making in its current, imperfect state. The powder is dissolved in very hot water, then poured into a mold while it is still in liquid form. As the liquid cools, the gel solidifies. This is phase separation, and it is what happens when most gels are made. They start off as liquid, and then tiny network of particles forms as the liquid cools. That network renders the liquid solid, often with parts that won't solidify sloughing off. Phase separation continues to happen in gels after their cooling. Even the best of them eventually turn to glop.
The new equilibrium gel is different. It is formed with a material found in many household products: a synthetic clay called Laponite. Scientists suspended Laponite in water and, using x-rays, studied how it formed a gel. At concentrations of less than 1 percent, the Laponite mixture broke down after three years. At concentrations above 1 percent, the gel formed a stable structure. The structure didn't separate into sections that had an over concentration of liquids and a stolid section with no give. It stayed at the same consistency, all throughout its structure.
It might not seem like a huge discovery, but "equilibrium gel" has enormous practical and theoretical potential. This gel could be used in everything from gel-covered medicines to batteries to nanotechnology. On the theoretical side, many are saying that this gel represents an entirely new ‘state of matter'. Bose-Einstein condensate – move aside.

Who runs the world? In entertainment, it's Beyoncé. The singer has climbed to the No. 1 spot on the Forbes Celebrity 100 after an amazing year featuring a massive tour.
Queen B played 95 shows, bringing in an average $2.4 million per stop, according to Pollstar. She also dropped her most innovative album. Titled simply Beyoncé, the album hit iTunes with barely any publicity and was billed as a "visual album" becausejay there was already a music video for each of the 14 songs. The single "Drunk in Love" has gone platinum, selling more than 1 million copies.
But Beyoncé doesn't stop with music -- she's built a small business empire. She earns millions endorsing companies like H&M and Pepsi. She has a line of fragrances with names like Heat, Rise and Pulse, and then there's her clothing company House of Dereon, which features jeans, shoes and accessories. All together we estimate that Beyoncé earned $115 million between June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2014.
The singer is embarking on another big year highlighted by her first world tour with her husband, Jay-Z. Their On The Run tour, which kicked off June 25 in Miami, will be short (only 20 dates are set) but lucrative for the pair, who can claim the crown as the most powerful celebrity couple in the world.
Full Coverage: The 100 Most Powerful Celebrities
Jay-Z also places high on the Celebrity 100 this year, in sixth place with an estimated $60 million in earnings. That comes from a variety of sources, including his latest album, Magna Carta ... Holy Grail; dozens of live shows; his growing Roc Nation empire and business ventures ranging from his 40/40 nightclub chain to his D'Ussé cognac.
FORBES' annual Celebrity 100 list ranks the top stars from the worlds of movies, TV, music, sports, books and modelling based on money and fame.
We estimate earnings by talking to lawyers, producers, agents and other in-the-know folks to figure out how much over 200 celebrities earned from entertainment-related business in the past year. That includes things like music sales, upfront pay on movies and endorsement work. Our time frame for earnings this year is June 1, 2013 to June 1 2014. We don't deduct for things like taxes, agent fees or the other expenses associated with being a celebrity.
We measure fame in a variety of ways. We count how many times each celebrity was mentioned in print, on TV and radio. We factor in a score from StarCount for social media power over 12 platforms including Twitter , Facebook and YouTube. This year we've also added an impact score, similar to the one we use for our Power Women list. Based on reporting by our editorial staff, the number measures the impact each celebrity has on the entertainment industry and our culture overall. We put all of those numbers into an algorithm to come up with our final list. Justin Bieber had the highest ranking for social networking power but because of his low impact this year, he only ranked 33rd on our list, down from ninth last year.
In second place on our list is LeBron James. We estimate that the basketball player earned $72 million last year. James recently announced that he's opting out of his contract with the Miami Heat to become a free agent. That could mean an even richer payday for James, who earns big endorsing companies like Coke and McDonald's -- or not if he decides to sacrifice salary to build a stronger roster around him.
In third place is Dr. Dre, who earned more in the past 12 months than anyone in the history of the Celebrity 100. We peg Dre's earnings at $620 million thanks to Apple's purchase of his Beats by Dre for $3 billion. The entrepreneur continues to be influential in the music business, mentoring Kendrick Lamar, who earned seven Grammy Award nominations this year.
Last year's No. 1 celebrity, Oprah Winfrey, falls to fourth place this year with an estimated $82 million in earnings. The talk show host's eponymous cable network, OWN, is finally turning around (it became cash-flow positive in 2013) and Winfrey helped make Lee Daniel's The Butler a hit. But the three celebrities ranked above her just have more influence and power at this moment.
Rounding out the top five is another talk show host, Ellen DeGeneres, who we estimate earned $70 million in the last 12 months. The new queen of daytime TV broke the Internet this year when she posted what has become the most famous "selfie" of all time. Aside from the ratings success of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the 56-year-old CoverGirl is beefing up her producing roster. Her production company is working on pilots for the CW and NBC, and cable network HGTV will air a DeGeneres-produced design competition series next year.

---- Ticketing FAQ -----
1. Is tent camping included in festival passes?
Yes. Tent camping (or walk-in camping) comes with every 4 Day Weekend Pass. If you'd like to camp with your car, you'll need to purchase a Car Camping Pass in addition to your 4 Day Weekend Pass.
2. Where do I have to park if I buy a Car Camping Pass?
Car Camping means that you have the ability to bring your car into the campgrounds and have it with you at your camp. There is not a separate campground for people with Car Camping Passes.
If you are planning on tent camping without a vehicle you will park your car in the General Parking Lot and walk or take a shuttle into the campgrounds.
3. Does each passenger need to purchase a Car Camping Pass to camp with that vehicle?
No, each adult will need a 4 Day Weekend Pass to receive their wristband and enter the festival, however you'll only need one Car Camping Pass per vehicle.
4. Can someone else purchase a ticket for me?
Yes, anyone else can purchase a 4 Day Weekend Pass for someone else, but know that wristbands will be shipped to the person purchasing the tickets. Address changes will be handled through our ticketing partner. Further info will be available once tickets go on-sale.

Mars famously has the largest volcanoes known to science. The largest is Olympus Mons, pictured above, which towers 22km above the surrounding plains – over two and a half times taller than Mount Everest. This extinct volcano is 640km wide even at its narrowest point, greater than the distance between London and Glasgow, or Los Angeles and San Francisco. And Olympus Mons isn't alone in the Earth-beating stakes – three other Martian volcanoes are more than 10km high.
Mars is a small world. It is half the diameter and less than 11% the mass of Earth, so the existence of such volcanoes was particularly surprising when they were revealed by the first satellite orbiter pictures collected by NASA in the 1970s. Ever since, scientists have been keen to discover more about these towering mountains – what they are made of, when they first erupted, when they were last active, and why they grew so much larger than anything on our own planet. So how are we getting on?
Spacecraft have sent back stunning images and data about these volcanoes over the years, yielding an amazing amount of knowledge. We have learned a lot from the impact craters made by asteroids, for example, since older areas on the planet have more craters than younger areas.
From this, scientists have concluded that the volcanoes on Mars began erupting well over 3.5 billion years ago, roughly comparable to how far back eruptions go on Earth. The most recent Martian eruptions are perhaps a few tens of millions of years old. No active volcanoes have been discovered; at least not yet.

Scientists also study Martian volcanoes by examining certain meteorites on Earth. Asteroid strikes on Mars are relevant to this as well, since massive amounts of energy are released when big asteroids hit the surface. This is often sufficient to blast other pieces of rock upwards, some of which reach Earth as meteorites.
We have now recovered over 100 samples of genuine Martian space rock: the gases trapped inside them match the Martian atmosphere as recorded by the Viking and Curiosity missions. The meteorites can be examined in laboratories with state-of-the-art machines that are too large and heavy to fit on spacecraft. My colleagues and I have just published the latest such research in Nature Communications. The first detailed analysis of the eruption rates of volcanoes on Mars using Martian meteorites, it involved the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, the University of Glasgow, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and the Natural History Museum in London.

We examined six meteorites which had been found in various places over the last century, including the Egyptian desert (see right), Indiana in the American Midwest, and the barren ice fields of Antarctica. They had been ejected into space together around 11m years ago – this is important because it means they must have left Mars following the same asteroid impact crater on the same volcano.
To determine when the rocks originally erupted, we used a technique known as argon-argon geochronology. This works by measuring, using a mass spectrometer, the amount of argon built up from the natural decay of potassium. It showed that the meteorites formed 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion years ago from at least four eruptions over the course of 90m years. This is a very long time for a volcano to be active, and much longer than terrestrial volcanoes, which are typically only active for a few million years.

Yet this is only scratching the surface of the volcano, since the asteroid impact will only have excavated rocks buried a few tens of metres below the surface. When we are talking about a volcano that could be upwards of 10km tall, this only represents a very small portion of its history. It must therefore have started erupting before the 1.4 billion-year-old rocks that we have been studying were formed.
We were also able to calculate that this volcano grew exceptionally slowly – about 1,000 times more slowly than volcanoes on Earth. This again indicates that for the Martian volcanoes to have grown so large, Mars must have been far more volcanically active in the distant past. It all serves to support the previous findings I mentioned about Martian volcanoes dating back upwards of 3.5 billion years.
Knowns and unknowns
The other reason for the massive size of Martian volcanoes is that Mars lacks active plate tectonics. This has allowed molten rock to erupt through the same parts of the planet's crust for very long periods. For terrestrial volcanoes, by contrast, plate tectonics moves them away from their magma sources and brings their eruptions to an end.
The last piece of the puzzle for our Martian meteorites was where they came from. By investigating NASA satellite photos we found a potential candidate: a crater large enough to have ejected meteorites into space, but young enough to be consistent with the 11 million year ejection age, and on volcanic terrain. As yet unnamed, the crater is 900km from the summit of the 12.6km Elysium Mons volcano, over 2,000km north of the present site of the NASA Curiosity rover.
Our research work has underlined the significant differences in volcanic activity between Earth and Mars, but numerous secrets about these Martian wonders remain. Scientists are still debating the mechanisms in the planet's mantle that drive such volcanoes and keep supplying magma for eruptions in the same places for so long. The age of the most recent eruptions on Mars are also still subject to considerable uncertainty. And there's much still to be uncovered about the links between the planet's volcanoes and its atmosphere.
Some of these secrets will continue to be unravelled through studying Martian meteorites, satellite images and new rovers. To truly understand the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, however, we will probably have to collect pieces of our neighbouring planet through human or robotic missions and bring them back to Earth.
Taylor Swift played the first of two sold-out shows in Dublin last night, but you won't find a photograph of her onstage at the 3Arena in The Irish Times today.
The singer has insisted all photographers covering her live shows sign contracts which outline restrictions on what they can and cannot do with pictures of the pop star onstage. The use of such contracts has become increasingly common in the live music business in recent years.
However, Swift's photograph authorisation contract includes a number of onerous restrictions, including a “one-time-only” use limit on publishing the photograph which elapses at the end of 2015.
Any other use requires “written consent” from the artist or her agent, while Swift reserves the “perpetual, worldwide” right to use the photographs for publicity and promotion.
Talking about the decision not to use photographs of the singer, The Irish Times deputy picture editor Brenda Fitzsimons said: “The terms and conditions of the contract are exceedingly restrictive and just not feasible for a working newspaper and website.
“The photographs may be used on a one-time only basis and by signing her contract we grant Swift perpetual, worldwide right to use the published photographs in any way she sees fit.”
Swift recently received many plaudits from music industry observers for criticising streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify on behalf of independent artists, over copyright and royalties.
However, she has now been labelled a hypocrite for treating photographers in much the same way she believes Apple and Spotify have treated her.
An open letter from British freelance photographer Jason Sheldon was widely shared online in the past week, when he pointed out certain aspects of the contract.
“Photographers don't ask for your music for free,” Sheldon wrote in his letter. “Please don't ask us to provide you with your marketing material for free.”
A spokesperson for Swift responded that the contract had been “misrepresented” and that copyright would remain with the photographer, which Sheldon says he never disputed in the first place.
But this move by Swift to protect her image rights is another example of artists and artist representatives going to considerable lengths to protect any potential revenue source as the traditional music industry contracts.
Once, allowing photographers to snap live shots was a way of promoting an artist. Now, it's seen as giving an unscrupulous snapper the means to produce an unofficial Taylor Swift calendar or book.
The next step must surely be a clampdown on camera phones in the first couple of rows at every show.
Three shot, two killed by Chicago police in one day
By Kristina Betinis
28 December 2015
On December 26, a college student and a bakery worker were shot and killed by one or more members of the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in an incident on the west side of the city. In a separate incident that day, a 26-year-old father was shot five times and seriously injured by CPD officers on the far south side of the city.
The killings in Chicago add to the daily list of victims of police violence. According the news aggregator KilledByPolice.net, 1,185 people have been killed by cops in 2015 so far, a 6.7 percent increase over the 1,108 killed in 2014.
The shootings occur amid a political crisis in the city of Chicago touched off by the exposure of a cover-up orchestrated by the administration of Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel of the 2014 police murder of 19-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago cop Jason Van Dyke. (See: “A police killing and criminal conspiracy in Chicago”)
Early on December 26, one or more Chicago police officers shot and killed 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, a Northern Illinois University electrical engineering student home for the Christmas holiday, and 55-year-old Bettie Jones, a bakery worker and mother of five, in the west side neighborhood of Garfield Park. At 4:15 a.m. LeGrier's father, Antonio, called the police to the apartment building where LeGrier and Jones both lived to help with a mental health episode Quintonio was suffering. According to relatives, the younger LeGrier struggled in recent months with some mental health issues, and had recently been prescribed medications.
The young man was reported to be acting erratically and swinging a baseball bat in the apartment and hitting his father's bedroom door. Police arrived around 4:25 a.m. In less than an hour, both Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones were declared dead at two different area hospitals.
Antonio LeGrier, the landlord, called Bettie Jones, his downstairs tenant, to ask her to let the police into the building. Jones was reportedly shot in the neck as she opened the door. Jones was heard to yell, “Whoa! Whoa!” several times before the cops fired. One of Jones's five children, Latisha, was awakened by the noise and ran to her mother's side as she lay unresponsive on the ground. Latisha said she learned several hours later that her mother was dead.
Some facts about what took place are still unclear, including how many officers fired into the home. The only witnesses to the shootings were the cops and the victims. Antonio LeGrier said he was making his way down to the first floor when he heard shots and found both his son and Bettie Jones wounded in the foyer of the building. At least one news report indicates that bullet holes in the door and inside the entryway of the apartment building show police may have shot through the door. It is not clear whether LeGrier was armed with the bat when he was killed. CPD has given no comment on the circumstances of the killings.
Families of both the victims have spoken out about the recklessness and brutality of the police. Antonio LeGrier told the Sun-Times he heard a cop yell, “F—, no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the bat.”
LeGrier went on to say, “In my opinion, he knew he had messed up. It was senseless. He knew he had shot blindly, recklessly into the doorway and now two people are dead because of it. My son had some emotional problems. Did it warrant him getting shot and killed? I don't believe it.”
Quintonio's mother, Janet Cooksey, said, “They did tell me he was shot seven times. ... I don't take all of that. My son only weighed about 150 pounds. Why do you have to be shot that many times? Why? If the police is trained in the field, then how, they're just handling the situation by killing people?”
Bettie Jones' brother, James Reynolds, declared, “They'll say it was justified, and then 14 days later no one will even be talking about it anymore… By that time, it will have probably happened to someone else.”
At a vigil held December 27 on the block where LeGrier and Jones were killed, local Democratic politicians sought to obscure the class character of police violence and shore up support for the Democratic Party by appealing to the Obama administration. Since 2013, Obama has overseen a staggering increase in police violence in the US and the distribution of military-grade weaponry and vehicles to domestic police departments, including those used in Ferguson, Missouri against protests over the 2014 police murder of Michael Brown.
Congressman Danny Davis, referring to the federal civil rights investigation of the Chicago police department that was opened after the uncovering of the murder of Laquan McDonald, said, “Federal investigators are in town. Of course we eagerly await their findings.”
Another official said, “Here in his hometown, President Obama we are under siege. We need help. And here in Chicago right now we need leadership we can trust.”
On the same day that Jones and LeGrier were killed, 26-year-old Mikel Lumpkin was shot by Chicago police in the south side neighborhood of Washington Heights. Lumpkin was reportedly arguing with his brother, and police were called. According to witnesses, SWAT surrounded the block and police claimed one of the men had a gun and began firing. Family members dispute the claim that shots were fired. Witnesses reported that when asked to put his gun down, Lumpkin complied. He was shot five times and handcuffed.
Residents who witnessed the police actions became angry and some were arrested, according to witnesses. Jasmine Jackson said, “They tried to take this man's life even after he surrendered his hands… He surrendered. It's not fair and they shouldn't handle people like that. Everybody was upset because the guy was shot and he was in handcuffs.”
A number of videos have surfaced of the violence meted out by Chicago police in the wake of public outcry. After the release of the video of Laquan McDonald's murder, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez released video of the police killing of Ronald Johnson, shot to death in October 2014. Alvarez chose not to press charges against the officer who killed him.
After three years of keeping it from the public, the city this month also released video from December 2012 showing the murder of Philip Coleman, a 38-year-old University of Chicago graduate with mental health issues, at the hands of police in a local jail. Coleman was arrested after he began acting erratically, and his family called police in the hope they would help get him to a mental hospital. Instead he ended up in a police station where he was brutally beaten and electrocuted with a Taser, resulting in his eventual death.

A new phone scam targeting Vermonters is capitalizing on the confusion around the Affordable Care Act, officials announced today.
Susan Donegan, the commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, said in an interview that the scammers call and claim to serve a role much like Vermont's designated “navigators,” who are tasked with helping Vermonters enroll in a new health insurance plan through the health care exchange.
In reality, the callers are seeking access sensitive to personal data.
“In the course of the conversation [the scammers] have been very convincing to get people to even give over personal information like social security numbers and credit card information,” Donegan said.
Part of the challenge facing Vermonters and the state officials working to protect them from the scam is its similarity to a legitimate state effort that is in the works.
“I do know that as a continued effort for outreach,” Donegan said, “Vermont Health Connect is contemplating a program of reaching out to Vermonters to make calls to them to ask them whether or not they would like to have some more information and to talk about options on the exchange through navigators.”
That program, she said, may come into effect soon.
“There will be legitimate contacts, so it's more important for consumers to really spend some time figuring out whether this is bogus or this is legit,” Donegan said.
One thing Vermonters can do to make sure a call is legitimate, she said, is to ask for their name and a call back number and then call them back later. Often, she said, scammers can't be found in a second call, but legitimate navigators will be available.
“And then you can also call the health exchange folks and see whether or not somebody made a call,” she said.
Vermonters who think they've been contacted as part of this scam can reach the Department of Financial Regulation's insurance division at 1-800-964-1784.
ERBIL, Kurdistan Region—Less than two weeks before Erbil and Baghdad announced a deal to sell Kirkuk's oil through the Kurdistan Region's pipelines to Turkey, thereby resuming the exportation of Kirkuk's oil, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) had requested Baghdad to continue the suspension of oil exports because of lack of transparency and fairness in spending the revenues, and threatened to take “other mechanisms” to halt the exportation of Kirkuk's oil if Baghdad did not concede.The PUK on Wednesday released a letter sent from Herro Ibrahim Ahmed to Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on August 19 in order to express the PUK's stand on the issue of Kirkuk's oil while Baghdad was considering the resumption of its export.“The Kirkuk oil exports revenue from Bay Hasan and Havana fields was not spent transparently and fairly in the Kurdistan Region,” reads the letter. “Because of this, the citizens of Kirkuk were excluded from receiving petrodollars and this had a negative impact on the life of the people of Kirkuk.”“The security forces are protecting those fields according to our instructions. The decision to resume exporting oil was not made according to consultations and agreements with us. Therefore we refuse the order to export 100,000 barrels per day and ask to halt it. We hope you respond positively to our request within 5 days, in order that we are not obliged to take other mechanisms to halt it from those fields, especially since we are under pressure from the people of the Kurdistan Region and Kirkuk.”On August 30, Baghdad and Erbil reached an agreement to export 150,000 barrels of Kirkuk oil daily through Kurdish pipelines to Turkey, with revenues being shared jointly between the two governments. The agreement ended a five month stoppage of Kirkuk's oil.Earlier on Wednesday, an official from the Kurdish Ministry of Natural Resources accused the PUK of selling Kirkuk's oil via truck to Iran. “Without the knowledge of the Kurdistan Regional Government and Sulaimani governorate Kirkuk oil is being exported to Iran and its revenues are not known,” Dr. Sherko Jawdat wrote on his Facebook page.He accused “people and companies” within the PUK's administration of exporting 30,000 barrels per day to Iran with revenues of $30 million.
Below is the letter from Herro Ibrahim Ali to Prime Minister Abadi.

Yesterday's FT featured an opinion piece from Nick Clegg, where he set out his refutation of the IFS's analysis.
The Deputy Prime Minister is now arguing that fairness is about more than a ‘purely numerical' view, and that income distribution only tells part of the fairness story.
But, as with previous attempts, this argument does not stack up.
Nick Clegg's first criticism of the IFS analysis is that its statistics are misleading. This is an incredible claim. In fact, it was the Budget's own distributional analysis that missed out one third of its benefit and tax credit changes.
The DPM also claims that the IFS make ‘impossible' assumptions on DLA and on Tax Credits. Again, this is wrong. The Government's own analysis shows that they presume 20 per cent of DLA claimants will lose their benefits as a result of the Budget, and IFS have simply used a random allocation method to remove benefit from the number of claimants required to reach the Government's savings.
On Tax Credits, the assumptions are also sound. To model the impact, IFS have reduced all Tax Credit awards by the percentage amount needed to reach the savings the Budget identifies. If anything this method undercounts the impacts on the worst off – the policy detail already indicates to us that specific Tax Credit changes will hit the poorest more than those who are better off (for example, the £2,500 disregard for falls in in-year income, which by definition will only impact on those who see a reduction in their in-year earnings).
Finally, Nick Clegg asserts that by leaving out the Capital Gains Tax the IFS's distributional analysis is flawed – but the IFS have demonstrated that the value of these changes is minimal compared to the benefit changes it documents. Including the CGT change would not alter the fact that the poorest lose significantly more than the Budget's analysis indicated.
Nick Clegg them moves on to criticise the very idea of distributional analysis – surprising given that the Budget and the announcements surrounding it gave such prominence to this method of assessing fairness. He argues that fairness is about social mobility and policies such as a simpler welfare system and a pupil premium that will help the worst off.
The implication is that poverty and income inequality aren't a problem as long as poor people who work hard are able to achieve improved outcomes. This is a contentious view, and the argument that social mobility can be achieved without reference to income levels is misleading. As we showed last week, the evidence on social mobility is clear – numbers do matter. If you don't reduce income inequality, social mobility will continue to get worse.
The claim the that Budget is progressive was always far fetched – this latest attempt to defend the Budget's progressive credentials only serves to further illustrate its flaws.

Last night, a few hours after the United Nations General Assembly voted to give Palestine nonmember observer status in the international body—a move that the Times described as an “upgrade”—the Palestinian Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad, flew coach from New York to Washington, D.C., in order to see a movie about himself.
The film, an Israeli-directed documentary called “State 194,” is almost dreamily hopeful—capable, at times, of giving you the sense that this endless, corrosive, cruel, and seemingly intractable conflict is in its final stages. “If you are a Palestinian you have no choice but to be optimistic,” Fayyad says on camera. At another point, he says, “We are at the final turn to the homestretch—the homestretch to freedom.”
Fayyad is a technocratic revolutionary. He is a small man, a little pudgy, and wears smart suits and wire-rimmed glasses. He is sixty and looks seventy. He was born in Deir al-Ghusun, in the West Bank, and educated in Beirut and, finally, at the University of Texas, where he received a doctorate in economics. He worked for the I.M.F. and the World Bank before being appointed finance minister by Yasser Arafat. As Prime Minister, he devised an insistent ideology of constant construction and development in the West Bank. As the film makes clear, he is devoted to building the institutions, structures, and psychology of a normal state—even as that normalcy is denied his people. The reality of a Palestinian state, he has said, “will impose itself on the world.” His legacy is evident, in concrete, in Ramallah and throughout the West Bank.
The screening of the film last night at the Naval Heritage Center—an event organized by the Brookings Institution and the former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk—could not have been better timed, as the documentary's narrative builds to the Palestinian Authority's insistence on taking its case to the U.N. after failing to get anywhere with the Israelis in recent years. A hundred and thirty eight countries voted in favor of yesterday's resolution; forty-one abstained; and nine—including the United States, Israel, Canada, Panama, and mighty Palau—voted against. The vote came on the sixty-fifth anniversary of the U.N. vote that divided British-mandate Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Fayyad called that vote “Israel's birth certificate.” He went on to say, “We are still waiting for ours.”
Speaking before the screening of the film, it was clear that Fayyad was deeply ambivalent about the U.N. vote.
“There is a great deal of celebrating now all over Palestine and in the Palestinian diaspora,” Fayyad told me. “But it may fizzle out in a week or two. Whether it will or not depends on what we do with it. If we just step back and admire it for too long and let those who are made angry by it take the initiative, well, that is one thing. We have to be careful of that.”
“I am very happy about it today, but I'm realistic,” he continued. “We already have a great many symbols: a Palestinian flag, Palestinian stamps. If you are a Palestinian you cannot help but be excited, but the question is: How can this be leveraged? Our people are looking for a state as free people. We are looking for the real thing, not more symbols.”
The Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, is more than aware that his people may be punished for taking the initiative in the United Nations. They could be punished by the Israelis, who threaten to withhold the tax revenues they collect for the Palestinian Authority, and punished by the U.S. Congress, which could also exact financial retribution by halting funding to U.N. agencies that help the Palestinians. There were already such rumblings yesterday in Jerusalem and on Capitol Hill. [Update: By Friday morning, Haaretz reported that the Israeli government had begun the approval process for a settlement expansion into a zone known as “death knell for a two-state solution,” the Times noted, because of how it would cut off Palestinians communities as well as three thousand units in East Jerusalem.]
“I hope sanity will prevail,” Fayyad said. “But you don't know. Sometimes the imperatives of politics force people to be unreasonable and do unreasonable things…. If the Israelis decide to [withhold those tax revenues], that would be crippling.”
On the surface, “State 194” is an optimistic film. Its Israeli director, Dan Setton, worked easily with his Palestinian subject as he moved around the West Bank, meeting with villagers, checking in on construction projects, and attending rallies. Setton is clearly encouraged by Fayyad's successes, and his capacity to work, politically, in Washington and in European capitals. In the film, we also see young, idealistic Palestinian activists in the West Bank and Gaza coördinating non-violent resistance by Skype and e-mail; we see an Israeli, whose son was killed by Hamas, working for peace and conciliation with his Palestinian neighbors and friends; we see Jeremy Ben-Ami, the executive director of J Street and an American with deep family roots in Israel, working hard in the halls of Congress to push a two-state agenda and to counteract the powerful right-wing influence of AIPAC.
And yet one could only leave that film with a profound sense of unease. Fayyad is undoubtedly a man of decency—a constructive force in every sense of the word—but he has no real political base at home; his base is international far more than it is domestic, something he quietly admits. I noticed that he had an Ace bandage around his right hand and asked him what had happened. He smiled and said he had slammed his hand so hard on a table during a dispute inside the P.A. that he broke a bone. (“At least Khrushchev had the good sense to use his shoe!” he said.) Fayyad opposes violent resistance, talks of allowing settlers to stay behind, in peace, in a Palestinian state if they choose, and does not push the refugee issue. This makes him popular abroad, but he is seen as an accommodationist by many at home.
Fayyad's extraordinary efforts to build the institutions of a state in the absence of a state are greeted with praise in Israel, but where does it get him, and the Palestinians, politically? Netanyahu, who has made broad rhetorical noises about a two-state settlement, is the most cynical of politicians, prizing his political coalition and survival over any sense of history and justice. Settlements keep expanding and the horizon for a two-state solution keeps receding. Netanyahu's recent decision to take on his racist foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, as a practical and ideological partner before the January election sends a clear signal to the Palestinians. At the same time, Netanyahu has stripped his party list of centrists like Dan Meridor, a cabinet member who was once a hardliner on the Palestinians but who came to recognize that the absence of a sane and decent resolution of the Palestinian question was a form of national suicide.
A few scenes in the movie show Israeli liberals at work: young people demonstrating in Sheikh Jarrah against the cruel displacement of Arabs from their houses; a crowd, led by Israeli intellectuals like Amos Oz, demonstrating for a Palestinian state outside the Tel Aviv hall where the State of Israel was declared. Stirring scenes, but what goes unmentioned is how small and isolated these demonstrations are, how far to the right the political spectrum is moving.
“I just saw an ad in the Jerusalem Post,” Fayyad said, and it depressed him. It showed a series of Likud politicians advertising themselves on the basis of just how vigorously they opposed a Palestinian state.
After the screening, I had a longer discussion with Fayyad and he called on President Obama to lay out the American vision for a settlement. He gamely talked up the day's events at the U.N. He tried to describe how, with negotiations and a true settlement, the P.A. would be able to join forces with, and soften, the political positions of Hamas. He almost seemed to believe it. But while it was an exciting day, it was a day that was ending. “And I am thinking about the morning after,” he said. On the morning after, everything awaited: a right-wing Likud government with excellent prospects of retaining power in elections next month and moving further right; Gaza, still disconnected, physically and politically, from the West Bank, and ruled by Hamas, which gained strength from its recent battle with Israel; and a series of regional dramas, from Egypt to Iran, which, Fayyad admitted, “have put the Palestinians on the back-burner.”
A day that had begun with a serious, if mainly symbolic, triumph, and a film that wanted to instill hope, eventually led to a darker set of conclusions. “It's obvious,” said Fayyad. “We are running out of time.”

The long-awaited trade of Darrelle Revis to Tampa Bay is finally done. With the Jets securing the No. 13 overall pick in this year's draft, the first-round projection obviously changes. Below, you'll see that reflected.
However, on Wednesday I'll have several other shifts, as I'm in the midst of talking with a number of sources now. So what you see below is more of an adjustment on my latest mock particularly as it pertains to the Jets.
Remember, I can't project trades below, so while I see several that could happen, I'll just note possibilities.
Draft-eligible non-seniors are denoted by an asterisk.
Luke Joeckel*, OT, Texas A&M
The best player available in the draft, and he fits a position of need.
Ezekiel Ansah, DE, BYU
Pass rush is a significant issue, and Ansah offers a high ceiling.
Sharrif Floyd*, DT, Florida
They need production and versatility up front, and Floyd will provide both.
Technology trials in Microgrid-as-a-Service aimed to impact the urban population in India
New Delhi – September 29, 2017 – Tech Mahindra, a leading provider of digital transformation, consulting and business reengineering services, and Power Ledger, a blockchain-based peer-to-peer electricity trading platform provider have announced a series of technology trials that aim at bringing the benefits of energy microgrid developments to India's booming urban population, through Microgrid-as-a-Service. Incubated by Tech Mahindra, Microgrid-as-a-Service or MaaS is an integrated platform which helps in creating a disruptive model in the electricity market by enabling building owners, campuses, smart cities and communities to produce and manage their own electricity affordably and even trade in case of excess generation.
During the trials, the partners will deploy Tech Mahindra's MaaS platform integrated with Power Ledger's blockchain-enabled energy trading capability at the test sites in India.
Atul Kunwar, President and CTO, Tech Mahindra said, “Tech Mahindra's belief in its internal start-up to bring digital disruptions to different industries is proved by the success of MaaS in the energy industry. This disruptive technology will provide a model for energy service provision for thousands of communities across India, and this will also benefit markets like the US, Canada and UK for modernisation of grid through microgrids. Many of our existing customers are looking forward to using the platform.”
Disruption and Innovation have been integral to the D.A.V.I.D (Digitalization, Automation, Verticalization, Innovation and Disruption) approach of Tech Mahindra as the company pursues its journey to become a Digital Transformation player. By exploring new avenues and capabilities in sectors as significant as the Energy, the company aims to be a pioneer in this space and add to the productive evolution of the utility industry.
Power Ledger uses world-leading blockchain technology to create an immutable record of energy generation and consumption allowing buying and selling of energy in a simple and autonomous manner with complete confidence.
Tech Mahindra's microgrid technology allows for a seamless integration of distributed generation within a discreet community, managing power quality, reliability and safety in a low-cost and sustainable way.
David Martin, Managing Director, Power Ledger, said, “Trialing the energy trading platform in a market like India is a major opportunity to change the way communities sourced the energy required to take part in a modern global economy. Bringing autonomous, largely renewable microgrids integrated with Power Ledger's technology to India, in partnership with Tech Mahindra, would give us a chance to demonstrate the potential of cutting-edge technologies and unlock the economic opportunities that flow to communities from having a secure energy source.”
The trial will initially involve Power Ledger using consumer data from Tech Mahindra's sites to prove the accuracy and security of the former's trading platform. This will also help Tech Mahindra to explore the value proposition for consumers and understand the regulatory and technical implications of the peer-to-peer trading model.The trial will begin in late 2017 at Tech Mahindra's campuses in India and run for a period of twelve months.

LOS ANGELES (CBS Seattle/AP) — The large cat that attacked a baby and trapped an Oregon family in a bedroom touched off an Internet uproar that worries Jackson Galaxy, star of Animal Planet's “My Cat from Hell.”
Cats don't become ferocious felines that turn on their families for no reason, says the cat behavior expert, who is heading to Portland soon to work with the 4-year-old part-Himalayan pet named Lux. Galaxy will film the visit for his show's fifth season, which kicks off April 26.
“Every parental site on the Internet blames the cat for this confrontation. Every pet site blames the family,” he said, adding that something is wrong if the cat is acting out. “We need to step away from the hysteria. There is a story behind all this. Don't assume anything.”
Lux became a worldwide phenomenon after owner Lee Palmer called 911 and said the cat had cornered him, his girlfriend, their baby and the family dog inside a room.
Palmer says his 7-month-old pulled Lux's tail, and he kicked the animal after it scratched the child. Then, the cat “just went off over the edge,” Palmer told an emergency dispatcher after the family barricaded themselves. “He's charging us,” Palmer said, as the cat was heard screeching in the background. Officers arrived and caught Lux with a dog snare.
Palmer said the cat had a history of violence, but the family kept Lux until Monday, when they turned him over to a Portland-area shelter. But the family assured Animal Planet they were going to keep the cat and agreed to therapy with Galaxy.
“He was brought in on Monday, March 17 after his owners called us to report an incident and requested he is removed from their home. We are working with the owners to facilitate the best possible outcome for Lux,” the Multnomah County Animal Services said in a press release.
Palmer didn't return a call from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday.
There are many reasons a cat can turn aggressive, and there is no universal way to deal with it, Galaxy said. But the star feline behaviorist provided five ways to tame out-of-control cats:
— Never leave a young child unsupervised with a cat.
— Take it to a vet at least once a year. If a cat is acting suspiciously, the owner needs to pay attention. “Know what suspicious looks like,” Galaxy said. “If they're not feeling well, cats will socially withdraw themselves, or they will lose weight, or they will gain weight, or they'll be howling in the middle of the night when they never did before.
“I've known cats who acted out similarly to Lux because of an abscessed tooth, a brain tumor, hyperthyroidism or diabetes.”
— Make sure cats can literally climb out of a situation. Having a space up high, like a cat condo, to get away from children and other pets is crucial, Galaxy said. “Make sure the cat can make the choice to get away from the kid,” he said.
— Timeouts are good things. “We associate timeouts with punishment, but in the world of cats, timeout is not a punishment.” They can go to a designated place where they can settle down, come back to a peaceful moment or ground themselves, he said.
— Stop fights between felines with “timeout drills.” With simple pieces of cardboard, left strategically around the house, you can stop a fight between two cats. Put the cardboard between them, blocking their vision and providing a moment of disorientation when you can lead them to their timeout spot. It's especially important to have the drills with aggressive cats.
Galaxy said he was going to Portland to act as Lux's advocate and find out what's wrong.
“I have no idea what made Lux aggressive,” he said. It could be a chemical imbalance, a history of stressful environments or because he was kicked.
“If you want a blanket statement on how to deal with aggression, how about, ‘Don't set the cat up for failure,'” he said.
The behaviorist, who has worked with tens of thousands of cats, said the thing that bothered him most about Lux was his continued aggression the day Palmer called 911, including the animal's ongoing assault on the door even though the threat was gone.
But the word “attack” doesn't sit well with Galaxy because 75 percent of the time, it's tied to a grouchy mood or a warning, he said.
“If I have a headache, I won't be the nicest guy in the world. I may snap at you,” he said. “This may have been Lux's way of snapping. Hypothetically speaking, someone pulling his tail may have been the last straw.”

Dissent is patriotic. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo)
DENVER – When Donald Trump called former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick a "son of a bitch" for protesting institutionalized racism by kneeling during the national anthem, Kaepernick's mom Teresa had the perfect retort: "Guess that makes me a proud bitch."
That was just the beginning of the blowback. By Sunday night, almost every NFL team, and even an owner, had either knelt or linked arms during the anthem in solidarity against racism and in protest of Trump's trolling. In Detroit, the singer of the national anthem took a knee. The Seattle Seahawks, Tennessee Titans and Pittsburgh Steelers stayed in the locker room as a team for the anthem. Bruce Maxwell, a rookie catcher with the Oakland As from a military family, took a knee during the anthem on Saturday, the first MLB player to do so.
But whether or not you agree with Colin Kaepernick isn't the point. This country started as an angry protest. It started as rebellion against authority and conformity. The United States of America drew its first patriotic breath as a fist in the air and a knee on the ground.
What Kaepernick is doing embodies that most uniquely American ideal: that dissent is patriotic, and that we as citizens are called to rebel when we see a wrong that needs to be set right. It is who we are as Americans.
Colin Kaepernick isn't tearing down the flag. He honors what it stands for. As Russian dissident and chess master Garry Kasparov tweeted:
The point—the beautiful, mighty point—of US free speech rights is to protect speech the majority and/or authorities don't like. Treasure it. — Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) September 24, 2017
Donald Trump picked a fight with African-American athletes because he's a harebrained old bigot who enjoys inciting racial tensions and starting fights to get attention. It's not a diversionary tactic. It's who he is. It pleases his base because the country is diversifying and that frightens them. Trump didn't say a word when a white Miss Texas called him out at the Miss America pageant. But he did attack ESPN anchor Jemele Hill, NBA MVP Stephen Curry and Colin Kaepernick.
But the greatness of our Constitution supersedes the race, color or creed of those upholding its values. The First Amendment right not to say the Pledge of Allegiance or salute the flag was decided in 1943 in a religious freedom case – that began as a protest against the forced conformity of Nazi Germany. Jehovah's Witness students in the U.S. began refusing to say the pledge and salute the flag in protest of their belief against idolatry, in solidarity with Jehovah Witness believers in Germany being sent to concentration camps for their refusal to salute the Nazi flag.
In the Supreme Court's decision upholding the First Amendment in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, Justice Robert Jackson had this to say:
"The case is made difficult not because the principles of its decision are obscure, but because the flag involved is our own. Nevertheless, we apply the limitations of the Constitution with no fear that freedom to be intellectually and spiritually diverse or even contrary will disintegrate the social organization. To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous, instead of a compulsory routine, is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds.
We can have intellectual individualism and the rich cultural diversities that we owe to exceptional minds only at the price of occasional eccentricity and abnormal attitudes. When they are so harmless to others or to the State as those we deal with here, the price is not too great. But freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order.
If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein."
These words are as resonant for African-American athletes in 2017 as they were for Jehovah's Witness school children nearly 75 years ago. They ring clear, deep and true as bulwark against totalitarianism and a compass of who and what we are as Americans.
Colin Kaepernick isn't attacking the country. Donald Trump is.
Although much of the West has been shaken by right-wing populist rebellions—from the stunning victory of President Donald Trump in the United States to the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union—one country seems curiously immune from it all: Spain. No electorally viable movement in Spain espouses a nativist, xenophobic, or anti-globalization platform. Indeed, far-right or populist parties in Spain have been unable to get more than one percent of the vote in most recent elections; the Spanish Parliament is one of very few in Europe in which these parties have no representation. Similarly, euroskepticism—the desire to lessen ties with the EU—is weak among Spaniards. A 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center found that, among all Europeans, Spaniards were the least supportive of reclaiming more power for national governments from the European Parliament in Brussels.
Spain's apparent imperviousness to these trends is intriguing because the nation has been anything but immune to the challenges that have elsewhere stoked a populist right-wing backlash. First is immigration. Trump, France's Marine Le Pen, Hungary's Viktor Orbán, and the Netherlands' Geert Wilders have each used this issue to rally supporters around the notion that immigrants are eroding their respective national “identities,” dragging down their economies, and threatening national security. Yet it is Spain that, among European nations, has experienced the most transformative immigration. According to Spain's National Institute of Statistics, the foreign-born population in the country swelled from one million to close to six million between 1998 and 2016. In the first decade of this century, Spain received nearly half of all immigrants coming into the EU and had the highest net immigration per capita of any EU nation. Clearly, Spain's resistance to populism is not explained by a lack of immigration.
Economic deterioration is another factor that is often mentioned as fueling right-wing populist movements, and once again Spain is—as it were—top among its European peers in this regard. After 2008, Spain fell into
China plans manned space launch in 2013: state media
by Staff Writers
Beijing (AFP) Nov 10, 2012
China is aiming to launch its next manned space mission as early as June 2013, state media reported Saturday, as the country steps up its ambitious exploration programme.
The Shenzhou-10, with three crew members, is aiming for a primary launch window in June, Niu Hongguang, deputy commander-in-chief of the manned space programme, told China National Radio in an interview Friday.
Niu, speaking on the sidelines of China's 18th Communist Party Congress that kicked off Thursday in Beijing, said officials had identified a back-up launch window for July or August.
He said one of the three astronauts would likely be a woman.
China sent its first female astronaut, Liu Yang, into space earlier this year on the Shenzhou-9 in the country's first manual space docking mission.
The docking procedure was a major milestone in the country's ambitious space programme that has a goal of building a space station by the end of the decade.
In its last white paper on space, China said it was working towards landing a man on the moon, but did not specify a time-frame.
So far only the United States has achieved that feat, most recently in 1972.
Beijing has said it will also attempt to land an exploratory craft on the moon for the first time in the second half of 2013 and transmit back a survey of the lunar surface.
China sees its space programme as a symbol of its rising global stature, growing technical expertise, and the Communist Party's success in turning around the fortunes of the once poverty-stricken nation.
The country sent its first man into space in 2003. It completed a space walk in 2008 and an unmanned docking between a module and rocket last year.
9Muses (Nine Muses) has revealed a surprise special photo book!
Recently, 9Muses have been arousing fan curiosity with pictures posted on their individual social media. Turns out, they're still cuts from a secret photo shoot for a special photo book, which is being made for the group's approaching 7th anniversary.
For this book, the members are teaming up with eight popular photographers, making the project even more unique. Each member is being photographed by a different photographer, and everything will be put into one book in a method unlike any they've done before.
The group's company, Star Empire, said “For this photo book, the members have participated a lot more. From their concepts to communicating with their photographers, etc., the members have been actively giving their opinions and have showed a lot of enthusiasm in choosing their outfits and props on set.” Star Empire continued on to say, “Compared to past photo books, this one seems like it will be the best expression of 9Muses.”
What's more, the photo book will be a rare limited edition! Currently the plan is to only print 2,000 copies.
The project will be carried out through MakeStar, an online crowdfunding platform. A representative from MakeStar said, “Rather than the 9Muses you see on stage, this photo book will allow you to experience the group in their off-stage moments. Furthermore, in the process of making this book, the members will be able to communicate with their fans from all over the world through several various events.”
The project will start in the first week of May through MakeStar crowdfunding, and all proceeds made from the photo book will be donated.

Legislation to force phone companies and ISPs to store data mired in working out how costs are split between industry and taxpayers, committee hears
The full cost of introducing the government's proposed mandatory data retention scheme is still not known, an inquiry has been told.
The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security is examining government legislation to force phone companies and internet service providers to store certain customer details such as phone numbers contacted, the time of calls, and the sender and recipient of emails.
Police and intelligence agencies already access metadata without a warrant, but argue laws are needed to standardise the information that telcos and ISPs store and ensure it is available for law enforcement purposes for at least two years.
Companies have warned that consumers could be forced to pay the costs of complying.
Anna Harmer, an acting first assistant secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, told a hearing in Canberra on Wednesday that assessing the cost of the scheme was complex and ongoing.
“That work is continuing but also naturally depends on the ability of industry to provide relevant information,” she said.
Harmer said the financial impact on individual providers could differ widely because of “significant variability” in their existing business practices.
The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, sought clarity from officials about the government's pledge to provide a “reasonable contribution” to companies' capital costs.
Harmer said the government had decided to contribute to the initial costs of adjusting to the scheme such as reconfiguring networks “rather than bearing the entire costs of data retention”.
Katherine Jones, a deputy secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, was unable to provide detail on the likely funding split, except to say the government's contribution would be “reasonable from the perspective of industry [and] reasonable from the perspective of government and taxpayers”.
Officials however confirmed the metadata to be stored by ISPs could be sought by TV and movie companies for civil court cases against illegal downloaders.
Labor's communications spokesman, Jason Clare, asked officials about the potential for owners of copyright-protected material to seek access to data for civil litigation against people found to be downloading movies, TV programs and music.
Harmer replied: “It is the case obviously that data that is already available and data that will become available in accordance with data retention is available and amenable to other lawful purposes including in the civil space, whether that is through subpoena or other orders for production.”
Such uses are not dealt with specifically in the proposed legislation, which focuses on the obligations on ISPs and telcos to store material to be specified by regulation. The government wants ISPs to retain the internet protocol (IP) address allocated to each user and when.
Police and intelligence agency chiefs told the committee hearing that metadata access was critical to criminal investigations, but that companies were increasingly storing less information or for shorter periods.
The Australian federal police chief, Andrew Colvin, said telecommunications data had been used in 92% of the AFP's counter-terrorism investigations launched between July and September.
Such data had also been used in 100% of cyber crime cases, 87% of child protection investigations and 79% of serious organised crime matters, he said.
Colvin said the inability to access metadata would have “grave implications” for the ability to investigate, deter and disrupt potential terrorist acts.
He said different providers stored different information for different periods of time, underlining the need for standard retention requirements to be enshrined in law.
“When the AFP is dealing with serious threats to national security and other serious crime, we cannot afford to rely on luck to see if the provider the criminal has chosen to use has retained that data,” Colvin said.
The deputy director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), Kerri Hartland, said the agency regarded the proposed two-year storage requirement as a compromise because it would prefer a longer period.
“Asio has consistently made the case for such legislation over the past decade because of the value of communications data to security investigations,” she said. “It's not a hypothetical discussion. Australia is a terrorist target, recent events have once again demonstrated that Australia is not immune from acts of terror.”
John Stanton, the chief executive officer of the Communications Alliance, told the committee there had been a “long and very co-operative relationship” between industry and law enforcement agencies. He said the industry had supported about 300,000 metadata access requests a year.
But Stanton said the legislation would be more accurately labelled “a data creation regime” because not all providers currently retained all material in the proposed data set.
He said it was still unclear whether the government would make a reasonable or substantial contribution to companies' costs, and therefore the size of the financial shortfall to be paid “ultimately by their customers”.
“If parliament decides to bring the bill into law we think it is vital that the legislation be clear in its requirements, that it be practical in terms of the impositions it places on telecommunications service providers, that it avoids unintended consequences, that it is mindful of personal privacy and it is proportionate to the security challenges facing Australia,” Stanton said.
Behind Support For 'Adoption,' A Web Of Clandestine Russian Advocates
Enlarge this image toggle caption Sergei Bobylev/TASS News Agency Pool Photo via AP Sergei Bobylev/TASS News Agency Pool Photo via AP
There aren't any caseworkers manning the phones at the offices of the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation on a tree-lined street in Wilmington, Del. In fact, there isn't anyone there at all.
The foundation exists on paper as an institution dedicated to making it possible for American families to adopt Russian children, but in the world of international advocacy, things sometimes mean more than they seem.
In this case, sanctions.
"Whenever anybody on the Russian side says adoption ban, that's really code for the Magnitsky Act," said Seva Gunitsky, a Russian specialist at the University of Toronto.
In the 2012 act, Congress punished Russians involved in the killing of a Moscow tax lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky. He had uncovered a massive tax fraud scheme involving Russian officials. The law freezes the assets and bans visas for certain Russians.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was infuriated with the sanctions and he retaliated by imposing a ban on Russian adoptions, Gunitsky says. At the same time, powerful Russians launched a massive campaign to overturn the Magnitsky Act, using lobbyists like those linked to the Delaware-based adoption foundation.
They include Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, two advocates who met last year with Donald Trump Jr. during the middle of the presidential campaign.
Trump Jr. is expected to talk with the Senate Judiciary Committee this month about that meeting, which also included his brother-in-law and now-senior White House adviser Jared Kushner and the Trump campaign's chairman at the time, Paul Manafort.
Members of Congress are expected to ask about what went on in the meeting and what Trump Jr. and the other Trump campaign officials knew about the group of Russians who came to visit them.
One American who has a track record of tangling with Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin is financier William Browder, who ran a hedge fund company in Russia that was a victim of the tax fraud scheme. Magnitsky was an auditor who worked for Browder; when Magnitsky uncovered the scheme, he was thrown into jail and eventually died in custody.
Browder told Congress the lobbying effort to repeal the act was a "highly resourced" operation overseen by Veselnitskaya and paid for by the Katsyv family of Russia.
Pyotr Katsyv is a senior Russian official with close ties to the Kremlin. His son, Denis, is a businessman whose company was sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act. The younger Katsyv's name is one of a number of Russian advocates that turns up on lobbying reports for the adoption foundation incorporated in Delaware.
Official disclosure documents associated with the work paint a picture of people with a foot in several worlds: advocating on behalf of powerful Russians, available to be assigned from Moscow — as arranged last June — but not technically employees of the Russian government.
"The people who met Donald Trump Jr. are close to the Russian power structures," said Louise Shelley, an expert in Russian organized crime and corruption at George Mason University. They are part of a network of people working to advance Putin's interests one way or another.
"Either they're part of the legal apparatus that helps him, the political apparatus that helps him, or are engaged in negative public relations campaigns — which are also a very important technique of the Kremlin to go after its enemies," she said.
Shelly says the Kremlin still believes ending the Magnitsky sanctions is a priority. And advocates such as Katsyv, Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin are integral to that. None are registered as a foreign agent. But that hasn't stopped them from pushing to overturn the act.

Hardened Ward is THAT bad for PVE at 6 seconds. This is not workable. We have to respec morphs based on what content we want to do, which could be multiple times in a day. I already pay enough money to the Shrine of Stendarr. Instead why not fix the stacking problem, or make the shields critable and full-length again?

Conjured Ward has more distinct morph choices (increased duration vs increased power)

The three-year American campaign has largely achieved its goal of reclaiming territory in Syria and Iraq, and the Islamic State's religious state, or caliphate, appears all but gone. Still, senior military commanders and counterterrorism specialists caution that the organization remains a dangerously resilient force in Iraq and Syria, and a potent global movement through its call to arms to followers on social media.
“As they lose the caliphate's physical terrain, they'll adapt guerrilla tactics,” Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of United States Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, said in an interview during a regional security conference in Bahrain. “ISIS has been beat up pretty bad. But this is a different kind of organization so we don't know what they might try to add. They've been very adaptive.”
Echoing earlier comments by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, General Votel said American forces will remain in eastern Syria, alongside their Syrian Kurdish and Arab allies, as long as needed to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Daesh. “What we don't want to do is leave a mess,” General Votel said, something “worse than what we found.”
Here at Al Udeid, home to some 10,000 American and other allied troops, commanders are running the air wars not only in Iraq and Syria, but also the campaign in Afghanistan that is expected to increase sharply in the coming months under President Trump's more aggressive strategy for combating the Taliban, ISIS and other extremist groups there.
For now, though, the bulk of the 300 combat aircraft under General Harrigian's command are concentrating on the Islamic State. “Job One still is to get to the military defeat of ISIS,” General Harrigian said. “We need to make sure we stay focused on that.”

Related Nine Kid Foods to Avoid
Fast food chains are notoriously cagey about telling consumers how their food gets from the field to the feedlot to the drive-thru window. Hope Jahren, a researcher at the University of Hawaii, believes consumers have a right to know how their food is made. She is the co-author of a new study that sampled almost 500 fast food items from McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King and proved what many Americans may already suspect: On a chemical level, the vast majority of fast food meat derives from a single source: corn. She did this by following the vegetable's unique chemical markers that persist even after it's been processed and mixed with other ingredients or eaten as cattle feed. (Corn is heavily used in feedlots to fatten cows up before slaughter.) Fast food critics say a single-source, corn-based diet is unsustainable, because the commodity is is heavily subsidized by the government and requires large amounts of fertilizer, water and fuel. TIME talked Jahren about why fast food represents the American diet, what we have in common with Germans and why fast food restaurants are depressing.
Why did you do this study? Was there a non-science motivation?
Half the restaurants in this country are fast food restaurants and they do a hundred billion dollars worth of business a year. For less than $3, you can get a full day's supply of calories. If you go into one of those restaurants, you will see a constant stream of people all day long. This isn't a study about fast food. It's a study about a big portion of the American diet. I'd be glad to walk into many, many dinner times in many, many cities and sample everybody's plate, but this was a pretty good way of doing just that.
How did you do the study?
We looked at six different cities across the U.S.  San Francisco, L.A., Denver, Detroit, Boston, Baltimore. We studied hundreds of burgers, chicken sandwiches and fries and at several locations in each city. We've got a truly national picture of this food.
Is corn-based fast food unique to America?
U.S. meat consumption is the highest in the world. It's one and a half times higher than the next country on the list, which is Germany. There's so much meat consumption going on in this country and that's another reason meat is worth questioning.
In the study, you say you sampled more than 480 servings of fast food. Did you have research assistants at the drive-thru non-stop?
These are people that work in my lab, professional scientists and students in cities where they happened to be, driving around to the restaurants, standing in line getting the food.
What did you find out about the health of the livestock and the health of people eating the food?
The take-home message is that there's a real information gap for the consumer. Diet-related diseases are on the rise. If you're suffering from them, your doctor is going to tell you that you've got to make informed decisions about what you eat. If you go and try to get this information in order to make these decisions, it's pretty much impossible. You've got to wonder why you have to do nuclear chemistry to get a very simple answer on how your food is made.
Why did you decide to study corn specifically?
Corn is conspicuously subsizied by the government and it has been criticized as being particularly unsustainable with respect to its requirements for fertilizer and irrigation and the machinery required. Corn is worth examining.
One striking fact in your study is that fast food restaurants get their meat from such a small number of suppliers. You say that all three of these chains get all their chicken from Tyson. There's certainly a lot of Tyson chicken in the grocery story too.
Exactly. Every piece of chicken I've ever seen could be Tyson chicken. How would I know?
Do you eat fast food?
No, I don't. That was one of the rules of the study  that you may not eat anything you buy for the study. But that's just scientific protocol. You have to be professional.
But as a rule, you don't eat fast food?
The last time I did was like 2004, long before I did this work. If you go and sit in one of these restaurants for several hours or if you visit a lot of them, there's just kind of a real aura of misery and unhappiness  both in the place and the folks coming in and out. It's striking compared to other restaurants. I think that's what influenced me more than anything.

The United States and the European Union saw the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 as a chance for Putin to distance himself from pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine and seal the border across which they say arms are reaching the rebels.
Instead Putin has stood firm, blamed the crash on his pro-Western antagonists in Kiev and signaled no change in his stance, leaving Russia facing the threat of much tougher international sanctions and economic and political isolation.
With an about-turn all but impossible for Putin after a fierce media campaign that has demonized the West, painted Ukraine's leaders as fascists and backed the rebels to the hilt, he appears to have passed the point of no-return.
“I think our state leadership is very experienced but I don't think it assessed the West's mentality properly,” veteran political commentator Nikolai Svanidze told Ekho Moskvy radio.
“We know the character of the people we are talking about, President Putin's character,” he said. “There will be no apologies.”
The deaths of 298 people on flight MH17 on July 17 have hardened the West's stance, narrowing differences between the EU and Washington over sanctions and, importantly, reducing the resistance of the powerful German business lobby.
Despite this, Putin looks unwilling or unable to change a strategy that has sent his popularity to record highs in Russia, particularly since the annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in February fueled a wave of patriotic fervor.
BLAME GAME
The president showed one, rare moment of uncertainty after the airliner went down, looking tired, pale and unusually unsure of himself in a television appearance in the early hours of July 21.
But he came out fighting at a meeting with security chiefs the following day, saying he would use Russia's influence with the rebels but also launching a diatribe against the West. He said Kiev was to blame because it had resumed military operations after a ceasefire. He neglected to say the rebels had defied the truce.
Since then Putin has said little on the crisis in public beyond suggesting Russia's defense industry must become self-reliant and stop using Western parts.
Western leaders would like to believe he is rethinking his strategy and looking for a way out of the crisis after boxing himself into a corner, but opinion polls suggest Russians want Putin to do exactly the opposite.
He is more likely to hold out against what he and state media have depicted as a Western-inspired coup d'etat that toppled a Ukrainian president sympathetic to Moscow and, using a phrase from the Cold War, was intended to “contain” Russia.
Political analyst Alexander Morozov said Putin could have headed off the West by distancing himself from the separatists but he saw no political dividends from doing so and it may already be too late for this. He has missed the moment, Morozov said.
New research by the independent Levada Centre polling group shows 64 percent of Russians blame the West for the Ukrainian conflict, 61 percent are not worried by sanctions and 63 percent think Russian media coverage of the crisis is objective.
“Everything so far points to a further hardening in Russia's stance. Mr Putin has too much invested - both from a geopolitical and, just as importantly, domestic political standpoint - in his standoff with the west to be swayed by sanctions alone,” said Nicholas Spiro, Managing Director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a London-based consultancy.
“The MH17 crash... is forcing him to harden his anti-Western stance much sooner than he would have liked. Mr Putin doesn't want to burn his bridges with Europe's main economies - but he may now be forced to do just that.”
THREAT TO RUSSIA'S ECONOMY
Putin's dilemma is that if he adopts a Plan B on Ukraine now he risks looking weak in Russia and could suffer a fall in public support that could damage his chances of re-election for a further six years in 2018.
But failing to change tack could have a detrimental impact on Russia's economy if the United States and EU push ahead with tougher, sectoral sanctions against Moscow.
This could put at risk the improvement in living standards and the financial well-being of many urban Russians, one of the pillars on which Putin built his support during his first spell as president from 2000 until 2008.
It could underline his opponents' concerns that Putin's third term as president, which began in 2012, is undoing some of the progress made toward financial stability and Western-style democracy since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
It is, however, a gamble he seems prepared to take.
Russia's $2 trillion economy is already teetering on the brink of recession and recorded zero growth in the second quarter of this year. The rouble is shaky and capital flight has accelerated to $75 billion this year.
But, for now at least, Russian business leaders are not speaking out against Putin because alienating the president could cause more damage to their firms than the sanctions themselves. Many back him anyway.
There was, for example, a defiant reaction on Tuesday to a ruling by an international arbitration court in The Hague that Russia must pay $50 billion for expropriating the assets of oil company Yukos, whose former owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky fell out with Putin.
On his radio show “Fifth Argument”, host Vladimir Averin asked whether it was time for Russia to pull out of such international courts in The Hague, Stockholm, London and Vienna. In a spot poll, more than 78 percent of listeners said “yes”.
LONE VOICES
One respected figure has, however, spoken out about the growing threat of isolation.
“I have serious concerns that the escalation of the conflict around Ukraine will be followed by conclusions ... that we do not need the world's best practices,” former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said last week. “Such an attitude, of course, inhibits seriously the modernization of Russia.”
As a friend of Putin, Kudrin is almost alone in being able to issue such criticism without paying a political price. But there are also other, clear signs of companies and institutions planning for tough times ahead.
Russia's central bank raised its key interest rate on Friday in a sign of concern that new sanctions could speed up capital flight from Moscow's already struggling financial markets.
Russia's biggest oil producer, Rosneft, said the same day that it had been working on a plan to offset the negative effect of sanctions - something other firms are sure to have been doing as well.
Kremlin officials last week poured scorn on Kudrin's warning, saying growth was intact and suggesting his comments were overly dramatic.
But in a new sign of the looming problems, oil and gas producer BP - by far the largest investor in Russia with its 19.75 percent stake in Rosneft - said on Tuesday further Western sanctions could affect its business in Russia, where it makes about a third of its crude oil output.
Foreign equity and bond investors, who had tentatively ventured back into Russia after a huge early-2014 selloff, are also again cutting their holdings.
“The expansion of personal sanctions ... is the most painful answer so far to the actions of the Putin regime,” Boris Vishnevsky, a St Petersburg regional politician, said of the latest list of individuals close to Putin who face asset bans and visa freezes under sanctions.
“Economic sanctions ... will inevitably affect not so much ‘Putin's friends' but all other Russian citizens. Because it will lead to the collapse of the Russian economy and living standards.”

RAYMONDVILLE — An 85-year-old Raymondville man was found dead after Africanized killer bees stung him about 200 times.
Juvenito Gonzales' body was found late Tuesday afternoon amid a swarm of bees near a day care center at the intersection of FM 490 and FM 88 west of Raymondville.
Paramedics believe the man was stung about 200 times along his neck, head and face, Willacy County Emergency Management Services director Frank Torres said.
“There were bees swarming around him,” Torres said Wednesday. “There were a tremendous amount of bees.”
Paramedics found a beehive in a stack of tires near the body.
Gonzales apparently was riding a tractor on his farm when the bees attacked him, Sheriff Larry Spence said.

Casualty Report: The War for Privacy
Like any war, the war for privacy has seen battles won and lost on both sides. Everyday the news mentions a new violation and likewise developers find better methods of keeping their privacy. With no end in sight many of us are wondering just whether we, the public, are winning.
Following the attacks in Paris last month, the Prime Minister of the UK David Cameron proposed plans to ban encryption. To defend these absurd new laws, he stated, “We must not allow terrorists' safe space to communicate with each other“, “In extremis, it has been possible to read someone's letter, to listen to someone's call, to listen in on mobile communications” and “The question remains: are we going to allow a means of communications where it simply is not possible to do that? My answer to that question is: no, we must not.”
Naturally, this caused an outcry not long after the government announced that the statement was referring to reforms of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA) and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), both of which cover the legalities of intercepting communications. For those of us living in Britain it is already illegal to refuse to give up your password or encryption key under RIPA (Section 3), a crime that carries a prison sentence. Thankfully in the US the fifth amendment protects people from having to disclose such information. With encryption becoming more popular with mobile devices, OEMs could be made to adapt devices that would be used in the UK.
US and UK government surveillance by the NSA and GCHQ has recently been found to be unlawful by The Investigatory Powers Tribunal who stated that they had violated human rights law. Breaches had been made for at least seven years since the introduction of the PRISM program in 2007. Following the news, the Privacy International charity created a petition for the release of details on who had been spied upon, which garnered 6000 signatures within just 24 hours. This petition will then be taken to a court in the hopes that the agencies will be ordered to release names.
Many aspects of our lives have been found to be under threat recently with many large companies going beyond how we would expect them to handle our data. AT&T has just launched their rival service to Google Fiber and are utilizing a brilliantly disguised violation of privacy to make more money. For $99 a month you can enjoy their service, however if you join their Internet Preferences scheme you can save $29 a month. Sounds great, until you look closer and realize what is actually happening. They are charging $70 for their service, but if you'd like your privacy as well it costs extra. The Internet Preferences scheme is an agreement where you allow AT&T to monitor you browsing “Independently of your browser's privacy settings regarding cookies, do-not-track and private browsing. If you opt in to AT&T Internet Preferences, AT&T will still be able to collect and use your Web browsing information independent of those settings.” In return, they will send you adverts: online, via email and by mail.
Lenovo has also made some questionable decisions regarding its users' privacy. Up until now, it has been shipping laptops with malware preinstalled, a software called Super Fish. The program analyzes images from your browser and then brings up adverts with links to the products for sale. However, Super fish has been reported to be performing Man In The Middle attacks by impersonating security certificates of encrypted websites, which in turn could compromise sensitive information of users. By installing these MITM certificates they open up to two risks, firstly the private key becomes available and shared amongst all users. Secondly and much more alarming, if you were to present a user of the Lenovo adware with an invalid SSL site, it would result in the the site being resigned and therefore appearing valid to the user even if the certificate in not legitimate. After significant media attention Lenovo has stopped shipping devices with this software preinstalled.
Even Samsung televisions have been in at the forefront of the war at the moment with reports that unencrypted recordings of users voices were being uploaded to Samsung for analysis. The privacy policy for these devices contains the following ridiculous phrase: “Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.” The third party in question is a company called Nuance who specializes in voice recognition and control. However Samsung has defended this by saying that the televisions will only transmit what is sent when the voice controls are activated via the remote. Regardless the thought that a conversation in the background may be sent to a company you have no knowledge of is alarming for many people.
The search for true privacy in our digital lives may be far from perfect but with a few precautions you can come a lot closer than most. The tide may be finally turning on this war with people becoming more aware of the need for digital privacy everyday. We may see in the future, a scenario where we have complete control of our data, but that day is still far off.
We have previously covered several methods for increasing your privacy:
Krypton Browser is an Android application that integrates the Tor network to provide a more private experience for you.
Xprivacy is an Xposed module that prevents applications accessing sensitive data by returning false or no results to requests for information, such as contacts or location. With Xposed now supporting Lollipop this is a must-have app for everyone.

A police helicopter that was reportedly monitoring the protests and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia has crashed in a wooded area, killing two people on board.
READ MORE: 1 killed, more ‘extremely' injured after car plows into protesters at Charlottesville rally (VIDEOS)
Virginia State Police identified the two people who died in the crash as the aircraft's pilot, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates. Cullen left behind a wife and two sons.
The police later confirmed that the crashed helicopter “was assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation in Charlottesville.”
“There is no indication of foul play being a factor of the crash,” the statement added.
Police are investigating the incident.
The helicopter crashed near Old Farm Road in Albemarle County, which is just outside the city.
"Shortly before 5 p.m. today (Aug. 12), a helicopter crashed into a wooded area near a residence on Old Farm Road. There are two confirmed fatalities," Virginia State Police said in a statement on Facebook. Fire units and police were dispatched to the scene.
Witnesses CBS19 News that the helicopter went down in the woods, and that a strong smell of burning was in the air. Police have sealed off the area.
A photo on Twitter claimed to be taken at the scene shows a large fire amid the trees. Earlier, a video taken from a nearby golf course showed black smoke rising from the area.

The helicopter was seen hovering at a low altitude over the houses before the crash occurred, witnesses told the Richmond Times Dispatch.
US President Donald Trump expressed his condolences to the families and colleagues of the police officers killed in the helicopter crash.
“The Deepest condolences to the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

The incident took place amid a state of emergency in downtown Charlottesville, which was initially imposed after clashes at the “Unite the Right” rally between alt-Right protesters and counter-demonstrators.
An apparent car ramming attack then took place at the rally, with a vehicle filmed plowing into the crowd at full speed. It reportedly hit at least one other vehicle before reversing rapidly away from the scene.
One person was killed and at least 19 injured in the incident, which police have been handling as a homicide.

Comedian Al Murray, who is standing for parliament in his guise as The Pub Landlord against UKIP leader Nigel Farage, has been on the campaign trail.
He is contesting the South Thanet seat, in Kent, in the general election after forming the Free United Kingdom Party.
Mr Murray, 46, visited a pub, a brewery and a school in the constituency.
He said: "If I were to win then I would definitely open a pub because I'm going to nationalise pubs if I get the chance."
Mr Murray, whose character is based around a love for all things British, said his party represented "rational common sense".
On why he chose Thanet, he said: "I heard destiny's call like a trumpet in the far distance and it sounded like it was saying Thanet, so Thanet had to be the place."
'Amazing Britain'
He said one of his manifesto pledges including making Thanet the capital city and "demilitarising" North and South Thanet.
"Why can't North and South Thanet walk in harmony together," he said.
He has also promised that beer will cost "1p a pint", although "crisps will remain at the current price".

During his visit to the Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Mr Murray said he was meeting "the adults of tomorrow" to tell them about "their chance to change this nation from Great Britain to Amazing Britain".
Asked how seriously he was taking the election campaign, he said: "Well, only a fool wouldn't take the general election seriously. And a vote for me is a vote for common sense."
A website has been set up for his campaign, carrying the slogan: "Other parties offer the moon on a stick. We'll do better than that: a British moon on a British stick."
His party is using an upturned pound sign for a logo, in a clear parody of the UKIP symbol.
Murray is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010.
Larry Donnell knows, as the Giants face the Eagles in a critical NFC East clash Sunday, his playing time will be diminished because he no longer is the starting tight end and he will have to earn back what once was his.
“I've been blessed to be up here,” Donnell told The Post this week. “I've also been down here, so I know how to fight back from those type of things. It's not something to be sad about, it's something to fight about. In practice, when I get opportunities, in a game, which I believe will come again, I make those plays and earn that trust back. That's how I see it, don't frown on it, don't be down on it. Just get better at it and stay better at it.”
Donnell, 28, has not improved nearly enough in the areas that have held him back. His ball-security issues are well-documented. His tall, lean frame does not help him succeed in blocking assignments. With the ball in his hands, it is at times a hold-your-breath situation for the Giants and their fans. On the second offensive play two weeks ago in London, Donnell caught a pass for 8 yards, was hit, and lost the ball on a fumble against the Rams.
“I've talked about it but it hasn't really become instilled in me yet and the ball still came out,” Donnell said. “I got to keep working, just like growing up riding a bike. You fall off of it you're not gonna get on it the first time and ride down the street and ride two miles. You keep on working at it. Sometimes when I catch it, I'm thinking about getting up field and the thought of holding the ball kinda slips.”
It looks as if Will Tye and rookie Jerell Adams have moved ahead of Donnell as the Giants struggle to sort out their unsettled and non-productive tight end situation. Donnell raised expectations in 2014 when he caught 63 passes — six for touchdowns — but it has been a decline ever since for a player who went undrafted out of Grambling State and worked his way up through the practice squad.
“How I got in this league is a blessing,'' Donnell said. “I've been here for five years now, I never came to work saying, ‘I'm s–t.' I always fight, always practice hard and that's what I'm going to continue to do to keep playing.
“Nobody hates me. This is an organization, I think everybody in it wants to win and those type of things I did don't help us in any way. I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to fumble. I got to hold onto the football because that's what's expected and that's what I need to do to keep playing.''
We've all seen dewdrops form on spider webs. But what if they flung themselves off of the strands instead?
Researchers at Duke University and the University of British Columbia have now observed this peculiar phenomenon, which could benefit many industrial applications. As long as the strands are moderately hydrophobic and relatively thin, small droplets combining into one are apt to dance themselves right off of the tightrope. The discovery could form the basis of new coalescer technologies for water purification, oil refining and more.
The findings were reported online on August 14, 2015, in Physical Review Letters.
“We were studying how insect wings with a hairy structure clean themselves, and an undergrad Adam Williams saw two droplets merge and suddenly leave a strand of hair,” said Chuan-Hua Chen, associate professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke. “Since we couldn't easily reproduce the effect, we thought it was just an artifact, perhaps due to the slight breeze created by the humidifier in the experiment.”
But thanks to some ingenuity from Kungang Zhang, a graduate student in Chen's group, they discovered that the “dancing droplets” are real, and are more likely to propel themselves off of a strand if they merge from opposite sides -- a finding that allowed the team to study the phenomenon in detail.
As a droplet grows larger, it stores energy on its expanding surface. When two droplets merge, the mass stays the same, but the surface area decreases. This causes a small amount of energy to be released. As long as the drops are only attached to a small solid area, the released energy is enough to fling them away. This proves true so long as the strand is reasonably hydrophobic, such as the Teflon-coated fibers in the experiment, and the diameter of the strand is a few times smaller than that of the droplet.
In previous research, Chen and his team showed a similar self-cleaning method from the wings of cicadas where droplets could launch themselves from a flat surface. That surface, however, was super-hydrophobic due to the nanostructure of the wings.
“In engineering systems, these nanostructures are concerns for reliability,” said Chen. “Our new finding provides a solution without resorting to these super-hydrophobic surfaces.”
A potential application of the dancing phenomenon is in water purification technologies. Current methods use gravity or shearing forces to remove accumulated droplets from fibrous webs, much like those found on your morning walk through the woods. If the droplets get too large, however, they can clog the gaps in the web. But with this new finding, fibrous woven materials could be engineered with Teflon-like coatings and large enough gaps to never clog before droplets jump off.
“Before we demonstrated this, people thought you'd never be able to get the self-propelled phenomenon on a moderately hydrophobic surface,” said Chen. “But now we've shown that you don't need super-hydrophobicity to get this dancing effect. All you need are round fibers instead of flat surfaces.”
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation.

Drought and habitat fragmentation over the past 30 years have caused a sudden and severe loss in genetic diversity for a rare species called the Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard (Uma inornata), according to new research.
This is small, burrowing lizard evolved among the windblown desert dunes of Riverside County in southern California. It's uniquely adapted for this habitat, with specialized nostrils that allow it to breathe through the sand while digging for plants and insects to eat. Unfortunately most of the lizard's previous habitats have long-since been lost to development or agriculture and the species is now mostly restricted to the Coachella Valley National Wildlife Refuge, which was founded in 1985 to protect the species.
Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other institutions took at a look at some of the last lizards living within the refuge and compared their genetics of specimens collected in 1996 and 2008. They found that one population, living in a portion of the refuge called the Whitewater Preserve, had experienced a 7.5 percent drop in allelic richness, a measure of genetic diversity. This means they have a lower genetic diversity than other species in their genus, not to mention other lizard species.
“It's statistically significant, but whether it's biologically significant will require further investigation,” says Amy Vandergast, a USGS research geneticist and the lead author of a paper in the journal Diversity and Distributions. Other species with similarly low genetic diversity have experienced birth defects, increased susceptibility to disease, low birth rates and similar threatening side effects.
Vandergast says the lizards probably had a history of population booms and busts, where environmental factors have caused certain sub-populations to disappear for a time. Extirpated habitats would then be recolonized by new lizards when populations grew again. That dispersal is no longer possible because populations are now so low and geographically isolated from each other.
Development has done more than just isolate the lizards. It also limits the amount of new sand that can contribute to the dunes each year. Conservation efforts in the refuge often focus on replenishing the dunes, as well as other attempts to protect the habitat.
It may be time to add long-term genetic testing into those existing conservation and management efforts. “Given the instability and fluctuations these populations experience, repeated genetic sampling may be useful in determining whether they'll continue on a trajectory of further differentiation and loss of diversity over time,” Vandergast says. “Assessing to the extent possible whether there are links between loss of diversity and inbreeding effects, and ultimately to population viability, are important next steps.”
Sony announces end of production of Betamax cassettes for March next year, 40 years after its introduction and 28 years after losing format war to VHS
Sony has announced that in March next year it will stop producing Betamax video cassette tapes, forty years after its introduction and 28 years after losing the war to VHS.
Assumed already dead by many, the final Betamax cassette will roll off the production line in March 2016 as its maker concedes defeat to the march of time, 20 ,maybe 30, years late.
The video cassette format was pioneered by Sony in the early 1970s and first released into homes embedded in a 19in TV in 1975. It was embroiled in a format war with rival video cassette VHS, produced by Japanese firm JVC.
Betamax came first and initially offered superior video quality, but when offered a license to use Betamax by Sony, rival JVC decided to develop its own open format to avoid Sony's domination of the market with a format it would control.
Japanese in-fighting
In 1974, the Japanese ministry of international trade and industry decided, for the sake of consumers, that it would attempt to force the Japanese electronics manufacturers to standardise on one format, rather than have multiple incompatible formats.
Sony initially won favour of the Japanese government due to having come to market first. To fight the proprietary format, JVC convinced its major stakeholder Matsushita, Japan's largest electronics manufacturer, responsible for the Panasonic and National brands, to back VHS. Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Sharp followed suit with JVC launching a VHS player in 1976, leading the Japanese government to abandon its video format plans and the eventual war.
Porn domination
VHS became a more open and widely adopted format for the video cassette, which resulted in a larger economy of scale, allowing VHS to beat Betamax on price.
That greater adoption and lower cost saw the pornography industry pick VHS as the format of choice for its home videos, which is largely considered the turning point that propelled VHS to victory.
In 1988, Sony conceded victory to the rival format producing its first VHS video cassette recorder. Sony's last Betamax recorder was produced in 2002, but the company will continue to produce tapes until March 2016.
Both video cassette tape formats were superseded by the video CD in 1993 – a standard defined by JVC, Matsushita, Philips and Sony, the successor to the 1979 LaserDisc.
Video cassettes lingered until the introduction of the DVD in 1995 by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic. Movie studios adopted the format for its superior video quality and durability, initially leading to DVD players only, not recorders.
Only later in the mid-2000s did affordable home DVD video recorders arrive pushing out VCRs, which were shortly followed by hard drive-based personal video recorders.
Betamax may be dead, but VHS tapes are still in production. So long live the video cassette tape, the video CD, the DVD and the Blu-ray.
BUFFALO – Tyson Strachan's only human, you know. So while the veteran said his confidence never wavered looking for work during the summer, thoughts about his uncertain future crept into his head.
As the weeks dragged on without a contract, the gritty former Sabres defenseman wondered if he might have to play overseas or complete his degree at Ohio State University.
“I'd be lying to say those things don't come into your mind,” Strachan said earlier this month inside KeyBank Center. “Obviously, you think about everything that's possible. At the end of the day, you're confident. There's nothing you can do about it other than just get yourself prepared.”
Finally, the Sabres showed interest, bringing Strachan back to the organization on a one-year AHL contract Sept. 14.
“This was a good opportunity coming in and knowing management, knowing a lot of the guys,” Strachan said. “I'm in a comfortable situation.”
Strachan, 31, spent all of 2014-15 with the Sabres, playing a career-high 46 NHL games. In a truly awful season, he was one of the few bright spots, establishing himself as a solid depth defender.
“I loved my year here,” Strachan said. “Buffalo's a great city. I was happy to come back here and be a part of it.”
But unless the Sabres rework Strachan's contract into a two-way deal, he will be parked with the Rochester Americans all season.
Considering the dearth of experienced defensemen in the organization, a contract upgrade isn't too far-fetched.
Sabres coach Dan Bylsma talked about Strachan like he could be in the queue for a recall. Bylsma planned to give Strachan some exhibition action before an ankle injury sidelined him.
“Hopefully, at some point … I get some time back up here,” said Strachan, who attended Buffalo's training camp on a pro tryout. “At the same time, if I'm down there the whole year, I'm excited about it.”
Other than Strachan's one year with Buffalo, he has spent at least a portion of every season since 2008-09 in the AHL. Still, the Saskatchewan native is used to earning recalls. He has played 186 NHL games, including two last season with the Minnesota Wild.
So this season could be “a little bit different,” Strachan said.
“But I think your mindset's still the same,” he said. “You're coming to work every day. Anything can change, right? That's been the story of my career. I've done that from Day One.”
That was nine seasons ago, when Strachan began his pro career with a brief ECHL stint. These days, Strachan is the Amerks' oldest player.
“You start to kind of embrace that older guy attitude, right?” he said. “You want to help out the young kids.”
For graybeards like Strachan, finding work has become difficult. The NHL has become a young man's league, and established talent is getting squeezed out.
“It's the first summer that I haven't signed in (the) first few days of free agency, so it was tough,” Strachan said. “It's a hard thing to sum up, I guess. Obviously, you're always confident in what you can do. But it's just the way it's gone the last few years coming out of the last CBA. It's tougher for older guys.
“Some days are good, some days are bad. Some days you're worried that you need to find a new line of work. Some days you're just confident.”

Former Sabres goalie Ryan Miller, now with Canucks, will dress for tonight's contest in Vancouver against his old team. Miller missed last game because “a muscle didn't want to settle down,” he said.

Presmoke thoughts:
I've wanted to smoke one of these for quite a while. I can't find them at any of the B&Ms around me, and never pulled the trigger on purchasing online. This last week I picked up a 5-pack of the RoMa Craft Intemperance because they are the Cigar Of The Month on the cigars subreddit, but while I was looking at the cigars on SmallBatch Cigars' site I noticed they had a 5-pack of the Herrera Esteli Short Corona Gordas. I had a 10% off coupon with free shipping that I was already using on the RoMas so I figured I'd add these to it.
I smoked my first Herrera Esteli Short Corona Gorda yesterday while running some errands. I definitely didn't give it the thought and attention it deserved but I wanted to see whether it was worth reviewing. It was, and I felt like I would have enjoyed it even more than I did if I had sat down with it. So here I am, sitting down with it.
The Herrera Estelis are named after their blender, Willy Herrera. Willy joined Drew Estate in 2001 and, according to this press release, they gave Willy free reign to experiment and come up with his own blend.
“Our goal is to give Willy the freedom to create his own unique style of cigars within our operation,” explains Marvin Samel, DE's Co-Founder and Executive VP. “Almost a factory within a factory, so as to allow him to succeed on his own merit. Ultimately the intent is for there to be brands that are not only ‘Willy Hererra' by name, but are ones that are truly those of his creation and efforts, not just some marketing gimmick.”
The Short Corona Gorda is vitola or size I can appreciate. I typically and most often enjoy smaller ring gauges which I've heard is due to the stronger ratio between wrapper and binder/filler. I also appreciate the short size as I frequently don't have 90-120 minutes to sit down and enjoy a cigar.

Beautiful, simple band. Lovely light brown wrapper only slightly darker than the iced vanilla latte I'm pairing this with. There's a great triple cap that held up to cutting very nicely. Slightly bumpy towards the foot, but it's not prominent.
Prelight:
The nose cold is a beautiful combination of honey and apricot. Maybe a little bit of sawdust on the nose too. The cold draw is sweet like a Gummi Bear.

First Third:
On my first pull of the Herrera Esteli Short Corona Gorda the beautiful triple cap I mentioned tries to come completely off. I wet it a bit and it is hanging on for at least a little bit longer.
The retrohale is very smooth and enjoyable, with a light nuttiness to it. The first few minutes taste sweet and earthy. Eventually the nuttiness transitions into the taste from the retro and it makes this even more enjoyable.
On the nose I'm getting a sweet cedar smell towards the end of the first third. It's amazing how pleasant the sweet aspects of this cigar are. They're not sweet like an infused cigar, but sweet in a natural, lowkey way like walking into a house where someone made cookies hours prior. It's slightly faint but not too subtle, and it gives you cravings for more. I'm finding it incredibly difficult to not smoke this in record time because it's hard to fight the craving to constantly want more of it. This is a seriously good blend of tobacco.
Second Third:
The second third is more of the same. It's not as boring as that sounds because it's just alternating between which of the core flavors is most prominent: sweet, earthy, or nutty. There's a lot of rotating variety in that constant juggle. The Herrera Esteli Short Corona Gorda is really good.
The nose stays amazing. The retro continues to be super smooth and nutty. The burn is a tiny bit wavy, but certainly nothing to complain about.
Final Third:
The nuttiness is the dominant flavor of the final third. As I get down to the final inch I start to get a very slight bitterness, and proceed to use my lap as an ashtray as I'm moving my arm to the window to ash outside. Gotta love that timing.
The bitterness is very slight and is more like a dark coffee than say tar. That is balanced at the very end by a new flavor: citrus.
Burn:
Very slightly wavy, never problematic, and the only negative thing I can say is at the very end I was burning my fingers this Herrera Esteli Short Corona Gorda was so good.
Final Thoughts:
This is a really great smoke. Up until I smoked this Herrera Esteli Short Corona Gorda, I was set on the Room 101 San Andres being my next box purchase but now I'm not certain which of these two it'll be. Two very different smokes but I loved both. This is easily a “keep stocked” smoke and may very well end up my next box.
In declaring 2015 to be a "year of ideas", Bill Shorten has raised expectations for a burst of ALP policy activism. In reality, the most talked-about idea in today's Labor Party has nothing to do with public policy. It's a new approach to election campaigning.
Traditionally, as Australia's party of reform, Labor has gone to the polls seeking a more substantial mandate for change than the Coalition. In the 1990s, Paul Keating depicted it as a contest between "enlargers" and "straighteners".
But if the recent round of State elections is any guide – in Victoria, Queensland and now NSW – this pattern has been reversed. In each campaign, the ALP has taken a minimalist approach, announcing a limited number of micro-policies. The Liberals, by contrast, have presented big-picture policy ideas.

In November's Victorian election, Labor Leader Daniel Andrews campaigned on small-scale issues, such as level crossings and school breakfasts. At the time, I labelled it "marshmallow politics" – tiny, sweet morsels that could be easily digested in local electorates. Andrews was strikingly successful, winning power at the expense of the Napthine government's grand transport plan for Melbourne.
Earlier this year in Queensland, Labor Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk was a policy-free zone – focusing almost entirely on a scare campaign against Campbell Newman's privatisation program. Away from this negative message, Palaszczuk's understanding of public policy was frightfully limited. When caught out in the final days of the campaign not knowing the rate of the GST, she blamed it on a lack of coffee.
Until the mid-1980s, only a single state – and one of the smallest in population, Alaska – had set a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. But with the federal minimum remaining unchanged at $3.35 an hour for most of the 1980s, more states began to set higher floors for wages.
A closer look at big issues facing the country in the 2012 Election.
By the end of the 1980s, a dozen states had their own, higher minimum wage. By 2008, 32 states did. The number has fallen to 18 today, because the federal minimum has risen since 2008 – it's now $7.25 an hour – and overtaken some state minimums, but the 18 include several large states. In Illinois, the minimum wage is $8.25. In California, it is $8. In Florida, it is $7.67.
As a result of these state minimum wages, the federal minimum is not as important as it once was. It applies to less than 60 percent of the population.
In this space, we have been examining the causes of the American income slowdown – over both the last decade and the last generation – and our recent list of 14 possible causes included the stagnation of the federal minimum wage. That stagnation certainly matters: in 1968, the minimum wage was 45 percent higher than it is today, adjusting for inflation.
But I think it's fair to say that the minimum wage is not one of the most important causes of the income slowdown. The minimum wage instead belongs on a list of secondary causes. It probably did play a substantial role holding down the pay of low-income workers in the 1980s and in increasing inequality, as research by David S. Lee and others has found. But its role seems to have been much smaller in the last two decades.
I'll confess that I did not expect to come to this conclusion. When we started this project, I assumed that the minimum wage would have played a larger role. If others think it has, we welcome hearing from them.
The crucial point is that the minimum wage has risen, even after adjusting for inflation, over the last 20 years. The reason it is so much lower now than in the late 1960s is that it declined so much from the late '60s through the late '80s.
The effective minimum wage today – a national average taking into account both the federal and state minimums – is about $7.55, which is more than 10 percent higher in inflation-adjusted terms than the effective minimum in 1990. Today's effective minimum is also about 7 percent higher than in 2000.
Yet the overall pay of people at the bottom of the income ladder has been virtually unchanged since 1990, according to Census Bureau data. And pay at the bottom (as well as the middle) has fallen since 2000. The rising tide of the minimum wage, to use President John F. Kennedy's formulation, has not kept most boats from falling.
Why doesn't the federal minimum wage matter more than it does?
For all the economy's problems, American society is still richer than it was a generation ago, with fewer low-wage workers. As a result, fewer are subject to the minimum wage than would have been the case in the past. The biggest changes have occurred among women.
In the 1970s, women made up the great majority of minimum-wage workers. But as women's pay has risen, the share making the minimum wage has dropped sharply. Over all, about 5 percent of all hours worked in 2009 were paid the minimum wage or less (some businesses, like restaurants, are exempt). That was down from 8 percent of hours in 1979, according to research by David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Alan Manning of the London School of Economics and Christopher L. Smith of the Federal Reserve.
The decline is almost entirely the result of rising women's wages. About 4 percent of men's hours are paid at or below the minimum wage, down only slightly from 5 percent in 1979. For women, the decline was much bigger: to 6 percent, from 13 percent.
None of this is meant to suggest that the minimum wage is irrelevant. It affects not only minimum-wage workers but also those paid slightly more, who often receive raises when the minimum rises. If Congress increased the minimum wage to its inflation-adjusted 1968 level, a large number of poor people would receive a raise. Some would also lose their jobs, if their employers decided they could not profitably pay the higher wage. But research suggests that modest increases in the minimum wage do not have a large effect on employment.
All in all, a higher minimum wage would probably lead to a rise in pay for lower-income workers in general and a decline in inequality.
The 1980s help make that case in reverse. The federal minimum did not change from 1981 to 1990, causing its inflation-adjusted value to fall 30 percent during that time. Wages in the bottom of the income distribution fell sharply, even more sharply than they have in the last decade. The inflation-adjusted wage of a worker at the 20th percentile of the distribution dropped 9.5 percent from 1981 to 1990, according an analysis of government data in the forthcoming book “The State of Working America, 12th Edition,” by the Economic Policy Institute.
Mr. Lee, a Princeton economist, argues that the minimum wage accounted for “much of the rise” in inequality in the bottom part of the income distribution in the 1980s. David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, and John DiNardo of the University of Michigan have made a similar argument. Mr. Autor, Mr. Manning and Mr. Smith suggest the effect was smaller but agree it existed.
Since 1990, though, the minimum wage has risen. If you're trying to understand why every income group except for the affluent has taken an income cut over the last decade, you probably shouldn't put the minimum wage at the top of your list of causes.
In coming weeks, our look at other causes will continue.
HBO's Veep is the kind of television show that Beltway politicos would love: It stars Seinfeld alum Julia Louis-Dreyfus as former Senator-turned-Vice President Selina Meyer, who over the course of the show's run finds out just how thankless, and ultimately, impotent, the vice presidential job really is.
So maybe it wasn't a surprise when Louis-Dreyfus, who to date has won two Emmys and five Golden Globe nods for her role as Meyer, received an expertly-crafted fan note from none other than then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“Dear Julia,” the note read, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “Hope you get everything you want as Veep — gun control, immigration and education reform.”
The 55-year-old actress told THR that for her, Clinton's heartfelt note was confirmation that political pros were watching her show, and that perhaps it was having an influence beyond the realm of simple entertainment.
But Louis-Dreyfus would learn the story behind the note a couple of years later, in an email Clinton sent to an aide that was made public as part of the State Department's order to the Secretary to release tens of thousands of emails in its investigation into her alleged use of a private server for government business.
The email, sent to former Clinton aide Robert V. Russo, revealed that Clinton didn't know much about the show.
“A friend wants me to sign something for Julia Lewis-Dreyfus for Veep. Any ideas?” Clinton wrote, misspelling the actress' name.
“Let me brainstorm on this one/do some research,” Russo replied. “I confess I haven't seen the show!”
To her credit, Louis-Dreyfus took the new information in stride. The actress told THR that she currently has both the note and the email framed side-by-side in her office. The episode is also unlikely to affect the way Louis-Dreyfus votes in the upcoming election; just last week, the actress told Vanity Fair that she will vote for “whoever the Democrat is. Period. End of story.”
If anything, the episode may be more embarrassing for Clinton, who has had celebrity names pop up in her dumped emails before. In October, an email released as part of the State Department's order revealed that actor Ben Affleck had sent Clinton a message to her personal account. Just a few days prior to that email being released, Clinton testified that the late Ambassador Chris Stevens, one of four Americans killed by terrorists in Benghazi, did not have Clinton's personal email address.

To think, there was a time before castles, swords, dragons, and magic dominated the world's biggest film and TV franchises. When that kind of geekdom was nowhere near a badge of pop-culture honor, we had to make the most of our limited options—particularly the limited option that was Black Angel.
The 22-minute short film, made in 1980, preceded The Empire Strikes Back's theatrical screenings in certain countries. Its medieval story—drenched in moody, Scottish landscapes and Arthurian inspirations—was soon lost to the world when its original negatives seemingly disappeared. But what a difference a few decades makes. The negatives were rediscovered in 2011 just as Tolkien fever had swept the world, and the film was posted to YouTube in its newly remastered form last month.
Now, Black Angel's creator has pushed forward with an ambitious plan: to remake the medieval short as a feature-length film, complete with actors Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner) and John Rhys-Davies (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Lord of the Rings trilogy) on board.
The ambition stems largely from writer and director Roger Christian—the Oscar-winning set designer for Star Wars: A New Hope, who went on to become a beloved art director for films like Alien—believing that a new audience of knights-and-magic fans are ready for the kind of "down-and-dirty" period piece that he couldn't have filmed in the early '80s with the film's original budget, paid by George Lucas, of £25,000.
"At each Q&A when the film was first screened again, I was always asked, 'if you could do CGI, what would you do?'" Christian told Ars. "'No,' I told them. I was inspired by the films of Kurosawa, and I want to take the same exact approach—almost like documentaries made in amazing landscapes."
In modern fashion, the new film launched an IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign this morning, but Christian assured Ars the campaign's low asking price of £66,000 wasn't some unrealistic goal. This movie's getting made, whether or not the Internet campaign hits its goal.
"We already have most of the money in place," Christian said, and he clarified that producers in Hungary and Belgium, where the film will largely be shot, are on board with funding in place. "I'm asking [fans] for a bit of money so I can have a few more of the Black Angel's army of the undead, so I can have a slightly bigger set, a few more costumes... but we're not attaching the making of the film to this. We can build interest."

Nine people, four actors, two horses
"I grew up with Arthur and the Norse legends, Lord of the Rings—that was my world," Christian said about his fantasy-novel upbringing, which was always in the back of his mind as he climbed the film industry's ladders before eventually making a name for himself with his set design work for Star Wars. "When I decided, enough of art directing, I had to do what I really wanted to do. I knew I had to write a short film. Stop talking and prove yourself."
Christian admitted that when Lucas asked the aspiring director to put together a short film, he'd already imagined a longer feature, but the film industry wasn't interested in his story. "I just plucked a few moments out of it" to make the 22-minute short, Christian said. His longer, ideal story was inspired more directly by an ancient sorcerer from Scottish folklore, Myrddin—a name you may better recognize as the kinder Merlin from Arthurian tales.
"I had to add an introduction to the YouTube video because it was a mere fraction of what I was trying to tell," Christian said. "I had a crew of nine people, four actors, and two horses. I couldn't do much with that."
Christian is already five drafts into writing—and, quite frankly, remembering—the story that he'd wanted to tell so long ago, and he says it's finished. He attributes his producers' interest in its remake to a mix of "a lost-and-found romance" of the original and of pop culture catching up to his own love of Medieval tales. The original story was presented in a Tarkovsky-style way—"I told enough keys to be able to make a story"—but it contained a mere fraction of the "real big story" that Christian has planned.
All of this isn't to say the original short can be ignored; it's certainly worth a quick YouTube stream. The film's influence only grew over time as fans thought it may never resurface. When Ars' own Nathan Mattise broke the news of its rediscovery and rerelease, Christian relayed stories of films like Excalibur, Dragonslayer, and Ridley Scott's Legend being influenced by Black Angel. And 20 years after the fact, Peter Briggs, writer of the original Hellboy, would tell Christian that he still couldn't get the short out of his head. But perhaps most importantly to fans of the series Black Angel preceded, this work is where Christian showed Lucas step-printing, the technique that eventually made its mark during the iconic lightsaber battle in Empire. From Ars' feature on the film:
Christian was forced to employ some emergency techniques because there wasn't enough initial material for Black Angel to fill the required 25-minute runtime. “So we slowed down fight scenes in it to build up the time,” Christian said. They did this through a technique called step-printing. Strategic scenes are shot at a slower film speed so action is sped up, then frames are printed at a slower speed onto the finished film. Action becomes very fluid, with individual moments seemingly smearing together with the next.
"One-on-one fights in mud and rain and dirt"
The two announced actors thus far, Hauer and Rhys-Davies (both of whom starred in Christian's 1994 bio-drama film Nostradamus) specifically requested to be in the Black Angel remake, the director claims. Christian is "throttling at the bit" to announce other actors who are all but signed to join the cast. He also insists that the leading character will be more age-appropriate this time: "In an ancient era, by 25, they were worn warriors," he said.
He's also in talks with Industrial Light and Magic, at least on a consultation basis if not an outright contracting gig, to help bring Black Angel's most ambitious ideas to life, particularly its sorcerers and flying demons. Christian wants any magical elements to feel "absolutely real, that you'd never even question it," and he reiterated his desire to steer clear of computer wizardry whenever possible: "I don't want armies of 500,000 CGI soldiers all battling it out. I want one-on-one fights in mud and rain and dirt, where you can feel every blow."
If the film's fate and schedule is as sealed as Christian says—specifically to tie into the hype and attention it will enjoy next to this December's new Star Wars film—then why bother with a crowdfunding campaign? Christian admitted that publicity is a big reason, but he also sees the campaign's be-on-the-set reward tiers as a chance for lightning to strike twice. "When I was growing up in Redding, I had no connection to the film industry," Christian said. "I got so broke trying to get into it, I sold my car, and by hitching a ride, I got a job. I'm offering to the Indiegogo crowd a chance to be a part of making the film. You never know if someone is hugely talented; maybe being a part of this will change their lives."
From the sound of things, it's Christian's life that has been hugely changed by this project. Filming will begin in September, and Christian looks forward to beginning work on another film, like Alien and Star Wars before it, that blurs the line between fantasy and reality.
"This is my passion project—the film I've always wanted to make," Christian said. "The tape being found out of the blue, the film being remastered, all of that has created a moment in time where it's possible to do it. I pulled the sword out of the rock. This is it."

VOL. 69 February, 1938 NO. 2
American farmers are promised a new cash crop with an annual value of several hundred million dollars, all because a machine has been invented that solves a problem more than 6,000 years old.
It is hemp, a crop that will not compete with other American products. Instead, it will displace imports of raw material and manufactured products produced by underpaid coolie and peasant labor and it will provide thousands of jobs for American workers throughout the land.
The machine that makes this possible is designed for removing the fiber-bearing cortex from the rest of the stalk, making hemp fiber available for use without prohibitive amounts of human labor.
Hemp is the standard fiber of the world. It has great tensile strength and durability. It is used to produce more than 5,000 textile products, ranging from rope to fine laces, and the woody ‘hurds' remaining after the fiber has been removed contain more than 77 percent cellulose, which can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from dynamite to Cellophane.
Machines now in service in Texas, Illinois, Minnesota, and other states are producing fiber at a manufacturing cost of half a cent per pound, and are finding a profitable market for the rest of the stalk. Machine operators are making a good profit in competition with coolie-produced foreign fiber, while paying farmers $15 a ton for hemp as it comes from the field.
From the farmer's point of view, hemp is an easy crop to grow and will yield from three to six tons per acre on any land that will grow corn, wheat, or oats. It can be grown in any State of the Union. It has a short growing season, so that it can be planted after other crops are in. The long roots penetrate and break the soil to leave it in perfect condition for next year's crop. The dense shock of leaves, eight to twelve feet above the ground, chokes out weeds. Two successive crops are enough to reclaim land that has been abandoned because of Canadian thistles or quack grass.
Under old methods, hemp was cut and allowed to lie in the fields for weeks until it ‘retted' enough so that the fibers could be pulled off by hand. Retting is simply rotting as a result of dew, rain, and bacterial action. Machines were developed to separate the fibers mechanically after retting was complete, but the cost was high, the loss of fiber great, and the quality of fiber comparatively low.
With the new machine — known as a decorticator — hemp is cut with a slightly modified grain binder. It is delivered to the machine where an automatic chain conveyor feeds it to the breaking arms at a rate of two or three tons per hour. The hurds are broken into fine pieces that drop into the hopper, from where they are delivered by blower to a baler, or to a truck or freight car for loose shipment. The fiber comes from the other end of the machine, ready for baling.
From this point on, almost anything can happen. The raw fiber can be used to produce strong twine or rope, woven into burlap, used for carpet warp or linoleum backing, or it may be bleached and refined, with resinous by-products of high commercial value. It can, in fact, be used to replace foreign fibers which now flood our markets.
Thousands of tons of hemp hurds are used every year by one large powder company for the manufacture of dynamite and TNT. A large paper company, which has been paying more than a million dollars a year in duties on foreign-made cigarette papers, now is manufacturing these papers from American hemp grown in Minnesota. A new factory in Illinois is producing bond paper from hemp. The natural materials in hemp make is an economical source of pulp for any grade of paper manufactured, and the high percentage of alpha cellulose promises an unlimited supply of raw material for the thousands of cellulose products our chemists have developed.
It is generally believed that all linen is produced from flax. Actually, the majority comes from hemp — authorities estimate that more than half of our imported linen fabrics are manufactured from hemp fiber. Another misconception is that burlap is made from hemp. Actually, its source is usually jute, and practically all of the burlap we use is woven from laborers in India who receive only four cents a day. Binder twine is usually made from sisal, which comes from the Yucatan and East Africa.
All of these products, now imported, can be produced from home-grown hemp. Fish nets, bow strings, canvas, strong rope, overalls, damask tablecloths, fine linen garments, towels, bed linen, and thousands of other everyday items can be grown on American farms. Our imports of foriegn fabrics and fibers average about $200 million per year; in raw fibers alone we imported over $50 million in the first six months of 1937. All of this income can be made available for Americans.
The paper industry offers even greater possibilities. As an industry it amounts to over $1 billion a year, and of that, 80 percent is imported. But hemp will produce every grade of paper and government figures estimate that 10,000 acres devoted to hemp will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of average pulp land.
One obstacle in the onward march of hemp is the reluctance of farmers to try new crops. The problem is complicated by the need for proper equipment a reasonable distance from the farm. The machine cannot be operated profitably unless there is enough acreage within driving range and farmers cannot find a profitable market unless there is machinery to handle the crop.
Another obstacle is that the blossom of the female hemp plant contains marijuana, a narcotic, and it is impossible to grow hemp without producing the blossom. Federal regulations now being drawn up require registration of hemp growers, and tentative proposals for preventing narcotic production are rather stringent.
However, the connection of hemp as a crop and marijuana seems to be exaggerated. The drug is usually produced from wild hemp or locoweed, which can be found on vacant lots and along railroad tracks in every state. If federal regulations can be drawn to protect the public without preventing the legitimate culture of hemp, this vast new crop can add immeasurably to American agriculture and industry.
We're trying to save these cultural artifacts because in northern Iraq it seems that everything is on the road to destruction: people of course, but also our cultural heritage. The artifacts were almost destroyed several times. There's been tension in northern Iraq since August but the situation has been bad for decades. The collection has already been moved on many occasions. It was in Karakosh – a town with a fairly large Christian population. But it was invaded by the jihadists in August, so the artifacts had to be moved to Erbil. When the priests heard that jihadists were approaching, they threw the manuscripts in a few cars and raced out of there - sometimes with only 30 minutes advance warning.

"There are extremely valuable findings that we've come across, such as what could be a Carolingian manuscript"
In 2015, we'll be celebrating 800 years since the Dominican Order was founded. This collection that we're referring to belongs to brother Najeeb – an Iraqi priest in the Dominican Order. He began the painstaking work of collecting and preserving these manuscripts towards the end of the 1980s. The collection contains various manuscripts that date from the 14th to the 19th centuries. There are extremely valuable findings that we've come across, such as what could be a Carolingian manuscript. This collection brings together works the likes of which we have never seen before, especially from a Western point of view. There are manuscripts that focus on the Koran, theology, spirituality, music, and grammar.
A manuscript that dates from the 18th century.
Many of them were in a lamentable state. There is a whole complex work of restoring the manuscripts. They have to be found and collected. Then the various fragments have to be collated and put in the right order. The work is extremely delicate. Our project is to recreate the manuscripts – create facsimiles – and put together an exhibition. We're going to display these facsimiles in the National Archives in France next May.
If you're worrying about the health of new literary projects: don't. Although it may seem as if we're stuck with the perpetual reinvention of old institutions (and there's nothing exactly wrong with that), things are, in reality, speeding along quite nicely when it comes to new, literary quality publications. There are so many tantalizing forthcoming (and just-begun) projects, in fact, with a variety of refreshing approaches, that we put together this primer to get you ready. These publications promise to deliver the best personal and literary essays, poetry, interviews, and academic writing.
Freeman's
John Freeman was the president of the National Book Critics Circle before he left for London to edit Granta. More recently, he was the author of How to Read a Novelist, an excellent collection of interviews with authors like Philip Roth and Marilynne Robinson. Last month, Freeman published Tales of Two Cities (with OR Books), one of the best recent essay collections on New York City. He is, in other words, a busy guy. His next project is Freeman's, an anthology-style publication born of a partnership between Grove/Atlantic and the New School. From what we know now, it will publish twice a year, and its ideal readers, Freeman says, are “people who are curious, crazed for fiction, morally engaged, disturbed by the status quo, and who want a reliable guide for the best writers alive.”
The Butter
A dream team collaboration between The Toast and the infinite Roxane Gay, The Butter, according to The Toast's co-founder Mallory Ortberg, will be “WHATEVER ROXANE WANTS IT TO BE.” More specifically, according to Gay, The Butter will “focus on cultural criticism and personal essays that make readers think and feel.” It's hard to imagine a better collaboration, or a better editor, for essays and criticism in 2015 and beyond.
Prelude
Prelude is a promising new poetry publication “unofficially” linked to n+1 magazine. Founded by Rob Crawford, Frank Guan, and Stu Watson, it promises to deliver on several things, in no particular order:
1. “To present the full panoply of poetic diversity currently happening around the world…”
2. “To promote diversely powerful poems of aesthetic and political merit…”
3. To present “works from a variety of aesthetic traditions with the only unifying criteria being that these pieces seek to engage with the political realities of contemporary life.”
Sounds good! The first issue will feature Ariana Reines, John Ashbery, Ann Lauterbach, Chris Hosea, Rebecca Wolff, John Kinsella, Jenny Zhang, and others.
The Happy Reader
A forthcoming collaboration between Penguin and “the brains behind Fantastic Man,” The Happy Reader represents an altogether new concept. The first half of the magazine will feature a long-form interview with a “notable book fanatic,” and the second half will dig in to a single classic of literature by way of film, fashion, lifestyle, history, and more.
Public Books
A well-edited and exciting site that features writing from academics both young and tenured, Public Books avoids the pitfalls of most academic writing with its range and quality. A look at the current issue will show you that it covers “The Salinger Riddle” as deftly as it does “The Piketty Effect.” This, to my mind, is the preferable direction for accessible writing from academics, away from the madness of BuzzAdemia.
Kansas University moved $25 million closer to a new medical education facility after a lead gift from the Hall Family Foundation was announced Tuesday.
With state funding approved last month, the $25 million Hall family gift will put KU in a position to start designing and planning the $75 million Medical Center expansion, a top lobbying and fundraising priority for KU in recent years.
KU Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little said the Hall family gift “enables us to move forward on plans to build” the new facility and “positions KU to address the state's doctor shortage head on.”
She and Fred Logan, chairman of the Kansas Board of Regents, thanked Gov. Sam Brownback and the Legislature for their support of the building. Gray-Little called the project “a shining example of lawmakers, donors and KU” partnering on a major initiative.
KU's lobbying and messaging strategy has focused heavily on winning support for the new facility. The Legislature turned down requests last year to move tax overpayments by KU toward the medical center project, before approving $25 million in state bonds this spring.
Officials say that a new building is needed to train doctors using modern educational methods. “You don't sit in a classroom and listen to lectures for eight hours any more,” said Doug Girod, executive vice chancellor of KU Med.
The new building will be designed to allow for more team-based work, experiential learning and new technologies, Girod said.
KU Med officials say the center could train an additional 50 medical students each year with the new facility.
Girod said he hoped to break ground on the facility by spring 2016.
Of the $75 million estimated cost of the project, officials hope to raise $10 million more through private donors, with KU providing the remaining $15 million left after state support and the Hall gift. Officials hope the gift announced today will prompt others to give.
The Hall family gift was years in the making and adds to the support that the family and foundation have given to KU over the decades, including a major gift that helped create the Hall Center for the Humanities.
Don Hall, chairman of the Hall Family Foundation, said KU Med and KU hospital have been “transformed into outstanding research and clinical enterprises,” but “certainly educational facilities have lagged.”

Why President Trump continues to sit down with major newspapers is unclear; rarely have the interviews ended well for him. But sit he does, and Wednesday's interview with the New York Times was one of his craziest yet. The interview makes clear that Trump believes he is the ultimate arbiter of investigations into himself — a Nixonian attitude that should scare anyone concerned about the rule of law. I say “should” because despite the president's chilling words, Republicans will continue to look the other way.
The Times interview was full of remarkable statements on a half-dozen topics, but Trump's attacks on Justice Department leadership and the Russia investigation are the most chilling. He lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe: “If he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.” He implied that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein may be partisan because he “is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any.” He threatened special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, saying that Mueller has “many other conflicts [of interest] that I haven't said, but I will at some point” and that any look into his family's finances unrelated to Russia would be a “violation.”

While the president delivered his broadsides, the deluge of stories about him, his finances and Russia continued. Here is a partial list of stories in the past 24 hours about investigations into the Trump White House:
Again, that's just in the past day.

Trump's fury over Sessions's recusal and Rosenstein carries a clear message: He wants a partisan calling the shots on the Russia investigation. Trump assumed that the former Alabama senator, one of the first members of Congress to endorse him, would have his back. He complained about Rosenstein, whom he appointed, not because he doubts Rosenstein's competence, but because he might be a Democrat. There are good reasons to dismiss Sessions — most recently, his constitutionally questionable expansion of civil asset forfeiture. But canning him for a Trump loyalist to oversee the investigation would send a dangerous message about the investigation's independence.
The threats against Mueller take Trump's attack on that independence even further. Not only does the president want a partisan overseeing the investigation, but he believes he still controls where it goes. It's one thing for a independent observer to comment on what Mueller should or shouldn't be investigating. It's another thing entirely for the president himself to say it, while musing that he could get Mueller dismissed due to “conflicts” at any time. Beyond that, the president also stated that he could have ended the Michael Flynn investigation at any point — and if he thinks that, he almost certainly believes he has the same power to unilaterally end Mueller's probe.
[No, President Trump, Sessions's recusal is not ‘very unfair' to you. This is Ethics 101.]
Yet despite the Times interview and the other recent developments, Republicans are not going to expand oversight of the Trump White House. There are many steps that could be taken: demanding to see the president's tax returns, stripping Kushner of his security clearance as a shot across the bow or holding up nominees until the administration answers specific questions, to name a few. None of those actions are likely. In fact, The Atlantic's McKay Coppins reports, while Capitol Hill Republicans are split on just how serious the Russia investigation is, “all of them believe they're already doing everything they can within reason to hold the president accountable.”
The GOP's cowardice should not surprise anyone. As I've written before, most Republicans supported President Richard Nixon almost to the bitter end of the Watergate scandal. Until Democrats retake Congress, the president's power will be essentially unchecked. We can only hope the damage he does is minimal.
Matter Design and FR|SCH Projects have teamed up to design a communal play structure in Lexington, Massachusetts. The new structure is located on the sloping landscape in Five Fields, a historic neighborhood designed and developed by the Architects Collaborative in the early 1950s.
The designers describe the Five Fields Play Structure as a landscape for childish exploration. The structure is designed to cultivate a child's imagination through play. It encourages inventiveness through its unfolding, discoverable spaces. The playscape is tailored to child size, but still accessible to adults. It prioritizes the child user, in order to both liberate and educate. It invites the older user to reminisce, and rediscover. The structure is a space for collective imagining and celebrating of all ages.
Just as each child learns differently in school, so the Five Fields Play Structure offers diverse but equal means of engagement. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements create distinct moments of use. The playscape is an unfolding of views, movements, and spaces. Levitating volumes overlap at certain points to create hidden thresholds. Smaller children crawl, while larger ones climb, as a varied means of reaching discoverable spaces. Colorful graphics suggest entries and moments of use, without being overtly prescriptive. Elements like doors and stairs exist, but not as expected. Movement through the playscape culminates in dead ends. But to the child, they are vistas of discovery that look out onto the landscape.
Jose Aldo vs. Conor McGregor is without a doubt one of the most-anticipated fights in UFC history, and as a result, the promotion is looking at holding the fight on the grandest stage possible.
According to a report by Yahoo Sports' Kevin Iole, the promotion is currently looking at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, home of the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys, as the site of Aldo vs. McGregor.
MMAFighting.com confirmed with UFC president Dana White on Friday that this is in fact true, however, White said it would not happen on Dec. 5, rather another date in December, which he did not disclose. No plans have been finalized just yet.
AT&T Stadium, which will also host Wrestlemania 32 in April 2016, can hold roughly 100,000 fans for a combat sports event. The six-year-old stadium is no stranger to big fights: it hosted Manny Pacquiao vs. Joshua Clottey in 2010 in front of a paid crowd of 36,371 and Pacquiao vs. Antonio Margarito in front of 41,734. Interestingly enough, both fights drew less than the 7.2 million dollar gate last week's UFC 189, headlined by McGregor vs. Chad Mendes, generated in front just over 16,000 fans at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.
To date, UFC 129 on April 30, 2011 holds the record for the biggest event in UFC history, as it drew a crowd of 55,724 and a gate of 12.075 million dollars.
Spain's caretaker government says it will take legal action against the parliament of Catalonia after pro-independence parties governing the region defied Spain's Constitutional Court by approving a resolution to press ahead with secession.
The resolution was approved Wednesday in the regional parliament in Barcelona by the "Together for Yes" group and its anti-capitalist coalition partner CUP, despite protests from opposition parties that it was illegal.
The motion was another step in the regional government's road map for independence by 2017 that was approved in 2015 but ruled as unconstitutional by Spain's top court.
The Spanish government said it had contacted the nation's main opposition parties to inform them that it would take legal action to block the process.
Catalonia accounts for nearly a fifth of Spain's economic output.
(Reuters) - A group of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday urged keeping federal tax breaks on private activity bonds sold by the developers of hospitals, nursing homes, airports and toll roads to reduce costs.
A tax bill in Congress to eliminate that exemption, plus tax breaks on advance refunding bonds used to lower interest costs, stunned the $3.8 trillion municipal debt market.
U.S. Representative Randy Hultgren, an Illinois Republican and co-chair of the Congressional Municipal Finance Caucus, said a letter he and 20 other Congressmen signed to object to the proposals was aimed at highlighting the value of tax-free debt issuance.

"It's really important for projects. We've seen multiple returns in jobs created," he said, adding that supporters will continue to push to retain these tax exemptions as the bills work their way through Congress.
The proposals are incompatible with President Donald Trump's push for greater infrastructure investment, the letter stated.
"This change in policy contradicts the growing need of the federal government to rely on more, not less, on states and municipalities, as well as the private sector, to help to finance needed infrastructure in a market driven, cost effective manner," the letter said.
It added that advance refunding of municipal debt issues over the last five years will translate into saving taxpayers in every state billions of dollars in interest costs.
Legislation that passed the House earlier this month, as well as a bill pending in the Senate would disallow states, cities, schools and other issuers from refinancing on a tax-exempt basis bonds that are more than 90 days from the date the debt can be bought back by an issuer. This is done by issuers in order to save money by taking advantage of lower market interest rates.
Current refundings of debt within a 90-day call date window would remain tax-exempt.

The House bill would also yank the tax exemption for new private activity bonds (PABs) used by nonprofit organizations and governments to finance projects including hospitals, nursing homes, colleges, affordable housing, economic development, ports, toll roads and airports at lower costs.
Tim Fisher, legislative and federal affairs coordinator for the Council of Development Finance Agencies, said the letter may help if and when a Congressional conference committee meets to hash out differences between the House and Senate bills.
"(The letter) is a good sign that shows certain House Republicans are willing to go on the record," he said.
The elimination of PABs would raise nearly $39 billion for the federal government between 2018 and 2027, while removing tax-exemption for advance refunding bonds would generate $17.3 billion over that time period, according to an estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation.
Photographers have already lodged complaints against the security firm that tried to prevent them from taking photos of the Olympic sites from public land, but it seems that even stricter rules will be imposed on ticket holders once the games begin. According to a freelance photographer named Peter Ruck, the Olympic organizing committee Locog intends to prevent attendees from uploading images and videos captured at the games to social networks.
The London 2012 conditions for ticket holders read as follows (see Section 19.6.3):
Images, video and sound recordings of the Games taken by a Ticket Holder cannot be used for any purpose other than for private and domestic purposes and a Ticket Holder may not license, broadcast or publish video and/or sound recordings, including on social networking websites and the internet more generally, and may not exploit images, video and/or sound recordings for commercial purposes under any circumstances, whether on the internet or otherwise, or make them available to third parties for commercial purposes.
It's still uncertain whether or not uploading stills to Facebook is considered private use (Locog hasn't responded to the Amateur Photographer's urgent request for clarification), but the conditions seem to indicate that it's not. Ruck — and we assume many others — balked at the rules, calling them unenforceable. One thing's for sure though, forcing that many people to keep their Olympic memories “private” would be a task of olympic proportions indeed.

TSSA backs Corbyn, calls on Eagle to pull back
10,000 supporters attend rally for Jeremy Corby in Parliament Square on June 27th 2016. Pic by David Braniff-Herbert
The TSSA executive has re-iterated its full support for Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party.
The union's announcement comes just a day after Unite and CWU did the same. Corbyn has also been backed by ASLEF, BECTU, BFAWU, FBU, GMB, MU, NUM, UCATT and UNISON.
TSSA General Secretary Manuel Cortes has made a last minute call to challenger Angela Eagle urging her to pull back from “this dangerous game of brinkmanship” which will plunge the party into a harmful internal battle.
The statement from the Executive Committee to TSSA members says: “TSSA reaffirms our support of the democratically elected leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. We condemn the behaviour of members of the PLP who have not cooperated with the leadership since he was democratically elected Leader.
“We supported Angela Eagle's campaign to become Deputy Leader just 10 months ago, so it is with regret and great disappointment that we now overwhelmingly condemn her decision to launch a leadership challenge against Jeremy just 10 months since the last leadership election took place in which Jeremy was given an overwhelming mandate by party members and she lost the deputy leadership bid.
“Angela has no mandate for this action and the Brexit vote has made it obvious that this is a time time when the party – including all members of the PLP – should be uniting behind the democratically elected leader and taking the fight to a Tory Government left in disarray by the EU referendum.
“If Angela proceeds with this leadership contest, it will be a deliberate act of political sabotage which will deepen divisions and increase wounds within the party but it will not topple Jeremy who will easily be re-elected as Labour leader.”
Manuel Cortes said: “Jeremy has the largest mandate of any elected Labour leader in living memory. His stand against austerity and the Iraq war and his commitment to public services have revived the Labour brand, sent membership soaring and despite the mutinous mood in the PLP, he has steered the party steadily to by election success and lead 22 defeats of the government since becoming elected. This is a leadership the membership and the movement are rallying round. So must the PLP.
“I'm concerned Angela is being put up to this strategy by masters of the dark arts who are intent on splitting the Labour Party come what may, so I'm asking her even at this late stage to pull back from this dangerous game of brinkmanship.
“Let's face it, if she doesn't, it will be Angela Eagle's name that may yet go down in history as the woman who split the Labour Party caused Labour electoral oblivion and paved the way for the new Thatcher clones Teresa May or Angela Leadsmen to lead yet more years of austere Tory government. It's not an epitaph we would choose for Angela.
“So I hope she'll reconsider in the national interest, in the interests of our working class people and in her own interest and not let PLP hot heads condemn us to another Tory government.”
Oil prices are falling, and for many Americans that's good news, as gas prices at the pump are down and likely will stay that way in the coming months. But for some — especially residents of certain states — the falling oil prices aren't the best news.
A study released this month by financial site MoneyRates.com , which ranked states based on their rates of oil production, oil consumption and the percentage of oil workers employed in each state's workforce, found that some states will feel the falling-oil-price burden more heavily than others.
According to Richard Barrington, the senior financial analyst for MoneyRates, while robust oil production is usually good for a state, falling oil prices can hurt high-oil-production-states' economic performance (not to mention impact the related job market), at the same time that it boosts the economic performance of states that produce little or no oil — in particular those that also consume a lot of it.
Here are the five states most hurt by falling oil prices, according to MoneyRates.com:
According to the Prosecutor's Office in Ansbach, a Bavarian city 25 miles from Nuremberg, German authorities had arrested three darknet drug dealers and three of their customers. After months of investigation, the investigators had uncovered an international drug trafficking network, Michael Schrotberger of the Prosecutor's Office said. The drug traffickers had distributed more than one million dollars worth of numerous substances throughout Germany and abroad.
In May, the authorities—likely Customs —intercepted a package of a significant quantity of ecstasy pills (an early press release said 3,000) and a large amount of amphetamine. Over time, authorities in Ansbach had intercepted thousands of ecstasy pills and kilograms of amphetamine. Investigating the source of these packages led investigators to the eighth largest city in Germany: Dortmund. After an unknown period of investigation in Dortmund, authorities had identified three darknet drug buyers and two distributors.
Police arrested the buyers without issue and then located two drug distributors. The authorities in Dortmund waited until both men, a 20-year-old and a 34-year-old, had prepared packages of drugs for shipment. We previously covered the arrest of the first two suspects and the raid of their “shipping and production center.” Police sat on the apartment for “a couple of weeks” before making a move.
The police raided the “shipping and production center” and seized 200 prepared packages. The packages contained amphetamine and ecstasy and bore the recipients name and address. Days after that announcement, Hermann Lennert, Chief Investigator in the Ansbach district, issued a warning to the men's customers. Drug buyers anywhere in the federal territory “could soon be visited by the police,” he said.
Two days later, the third and priority target surfaced. Police arrested a 32-year-old in the Weißenburg-Gunzenhausen district, far from the “shipping and production center.” The third suspect had created a second identity for himself. When police arrested him, they found a fake Austrian passport. As the apparent kingpin of the operation, the man had far more to lose.
Not only did he employ the two other suspects to ship his drugs, but the 32-year-old also used drugs, produced drugs, “hoarded” drugs, packaged drugs, and shipped the final product. Lennert said that he had “also operated his own Internet business.”
We also learned that the drug count after the arrest of the first two suspects was low; in total, the authorities seized 39 kilograms of amphetamine, 30,000 ecstasy tablets, 6.5 kilos of the ecstasy drug MDMA and 1.3 kilos of cocaine.
Lennert said that he was surprised by the quantity of drugs seized in this “new dimension” of drug trading.
Hollywood, Fla., Commissioner Patty Asseff (Angel Valentin for The Washington Post )
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — Patty Asseff, a longtime realtor and a Republican, drives through town in her jet black Tesla. Asseff, who has sold so many homes here, speaks with passion about two related matters — clean energy, and making Hollywood homes more resilient, not just against hurricane threats but against periodic flooding that seems to be worsening as sea levels rise.
“Talk about climate change, you know, whether it's scientific or not, it's got to be so much better for everybody all the way around going to clean-burning automobiles,” says Asseff. When it comes to a changing climate, she adds, “Anybody that has any kind of sense, has to know that there's got to be something to look at.”
But her outlook, as a realtor — and as a city commissioner — is practical: People aren't going to leave Southeast Florida or their homes and their families. So they need to prepare. Indeed, here in Southeast Florida, adaptation to climate change is already happening. Moreover, it's happening in a remarkably nonpartisan, get-it-done manner that, in some cases, doesn't require an explicit acknowledgement of the science behind human-caused climate change – but doesn't waste time debating the matter, either.
In recent weeks, we've gotten a skewed picture of Florida, arguably the most vulnerable state in the union to climate-driven sea level rise. Charges of a “ban” on even mentioning “climate change” within Rick Scott's government have made much of the country wonder whether heads in Florida aren't, literally, in the sand.
But what's happening in Southeast Florida belies this picture entirely. If anything, as the nation shifts more and more toward living in a changed world – in Florida's case, one in which rising seas are already beginning to erode beaches, flood neighborhoods, spoil underground water supplies and expose new areas further inland to storm surges — Southeast Florida is a model for how to deal with a problem that is neither going away nor getting less politically contentious.
Asseff is just one indicator of the get-it-done attitude. Far more sweeping is the 2010 agreement by the four counties of Southeast Florida – Miami-Dade, Broward (which includes Hollywood), Palm Beach, and Monroe – to form the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, an agreement that they would work together to pursue climate change adaptation measures, as well as federal recognition of their plight.
Two years after its founding, the compact released an action plan containing 110 recommended steps for cities and counties, ranging from cutting emissions and facilitating the deployment of clean energy to identifying areas which needed special attention due to constant flooding or proximity to rising seas.
“They've been leading on this for a while,” says Vicki Arroyo, who directs the Georgetown Climate Center. Not only is the compact the U.S.'s shining example of a regional collaboration to advance climate adaptation, says Arroyo, but its structure — a partnership between counties — may be more sturdy than anything that can be achieved at a state or national level. Here, administrations sweep in and sweep out and often change course — precisely what happened in the switchover from Charlie Crist's government to that of Rick Scott in Florida.
What's most striking is how the compact has deftly handled the difficult politics of climate change. The founding county commissioners behind the agreement were three Democrats and one Republican. The four counties themselves are politically quite mixed. Broward is the most left-leaning, with almost twice as many registered Democrats (551,794) as Republicans (237,693) — but it also has a very large proportion of voters with no affiliation (277,952). Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties favor Democrats by smaller margins and in Monroe County, which contains the highly vulnerable Florida Keys, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats.

Nonetheless, the compact's counties released a 2011 report finding that by 2030, sea level could be 3 to 7 inches higher, and by 2060, 9 to 24 inches higher – and it continues to rise from there. “The scientific evidence strongly supports that sea level is rising and, beyond 2060, will continue to rise even if mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are successful,” notes the report. The numbers are consistent with major scientific assessments and a 2010 report from the state-formed Florida Oceans and Coastal Council, which found that global sea level rise by 2100 will probably be between 20 and 40 inches — but could be higher.
Mindful of such numbers, cities across Southeast Florida are steadily implementing the compact's recommended adaptation measures. So far, according to a survey conducted in late 2014, Asseff's city of Hollywood had implemented 38 out of 110, ranging from restoring trees in urban areas to advancing local renewable energy development, to studying how rising seas will affect stormwater systems. That's an impressive third of the recommendations, but it's actually well behind some other compact cities, such as Key West, which had implemented 65 at the time of the study, and Miami Beach, which stood at 61.
If adaptation comes easily in Southeast Florida, it may be because the threat is so obvious to those living there. Most stark is the situation facing Monroe County, where the compact states that “three-fourths of Monroe's four hospitals, 65 percent of schools and 71 percent of emergency shelters” lie on land that would be flooded with a mere foot of sea level rise. But rising seas are a reality throughout the region.
In Hollywood, Patty Asseff drives toward the Atlantic Ocean along gorgeous palm-lined Harrison Street in the Holiday Lakes neighborhood, where Jorge Ferrer, 62, a retired airline pilot, lives in one of a clump of houses surrounded on three sides by water, just inland from the Intracoastal Waterway. Ferrer's meticulous blue and white home features an underground pump system to keep the water out and the floor of the house dry. It floods sometimes, and Ferrer — also registered as a Republican, though he says he leans independent — thinks it's getting worse.
“I've gotten to see the change in the canals here over a 50-year period,” he says. “And believe me, it's not the same thing it used to be.”
But flooding and rising seas or not, residents aren't leaving. “We love it here,” says Asseff.
“I love Hollywood,” Ferrer agrees. “She's the best commissioner we've ever had.”

Ferrer's house has a pump system, which was installed in the house before he bought it, which pumps water out from under his house when the tide rises.

(Angel Valentin for The Washington Post)
To the north of Hollywood in Fort Lauderdale, meanwhile, lies a particularly striking example of climate change adaptation (though it isn't necessarily going by that name). Here, the vital state road A1A, which runs along popular beaches and also serves as a hurricane evacuation route, was lined on a recent morning not only with spring breakers' vomit, but a mile long stretch of construction.
Two and a half years ago, a 600-or-more-foot stretch of the road was severely damaged due to waves from Superstorm Sandy (which barely grazed the area, but still drove powerful waves onshore) and then subsequent flooding. Both brought high tides that eroded much of the beach, weakening A1A from beneath.
But now, the road is being built back taller and stronger – two feet higher on the beachside in the key area where the damage occurred, according to Scott Peterson, design project manager for the A1A construction with the Florida Department of Transportation. Forty-four-foot-long sheet pilings have been driven into the ground along the road to ensure stability, and there will be a stronger seawall as well as newly installed dune protections on the beachside.
“We'd be crazy if we didn't build in resilient features into all of our projects – especially where we sit, next to the ocean,” says Chip LaMarca, a Broward County commissioner and registered Republican, as we tour the road along the beach in the beating morning sun. Indeed, adds the transportation department's Peterson, the planners were “mindful of an increased frequency and severity of events in this area and took steps to mitigate damages from future events.”
The destruction to A1A was a galvanizing moment for the community, says LaMarca — for good reason. Some 14 million people visited Fort Lauderdale in the past year, and spent $11.5 billion, he says. “Instead of debating the politics of science, or the science of politics, as this has become, we actually just got the work done,” he says.
The restoration project is a joint one between the state, the city of Fort Lauderdale, and Broward County — and the compact seems to have helped all the cooks work together in the kitchen. “It's a state road, running through the city, on a beach managed by the county,” says Steve Adams, a former energy and climate staffer for former Florida governor Charlie Crist, a Democrat, who now heads up the climate adaptation program at the Institute for Sustainable Communities, which receives funding to provide support to the compact. “So there was a lot of complexity there in terms of who had what jurisdiction. And because of the relationships the compact put in place, they were able to work together very effectively.”
LaMarca, in an interview, was hardly outspoken about climate change, but certainly was in favor of stronger future planning for sea level rise. “We've had, what, eight inches since 1870?” he said. “If that's elevating or accelerating, that's something we should put into our codes and how we build.” His construction business background doesn't hurt — he speaks with a clear knowledge about both road projects and also beach restoration.
So what's happening in Southeast Florida to make people so adept at adapting to climate change, irrespective of politics? It's not just living alongside rising seas — the tone set by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact and local leaders also seems to matter a great deal, says Yale law professor and science communication researcher Dan Kahan, who has consulted with the compact and heralds its approach.
Kahan found that if you pose polling questions in one way — simply asking how much people consider climate change to be a risk — then people in Southeast Florida look a lot like the rest of the United States. Strong liberals in the area rate climate risks as very high, strong conservatives rate them as very low — and the more people actually know about science, the more polarization increases. Thus, the seeds of the climate pathology on the national level — or, at the Florida statehouse level — are present here, too.
However, Kahan continues, something has happened in Southeast Florida to prevent those seeds from growing. It seems to be about using local government, competently, to address real risks that people can sense all around them. Thus, Kahan's data show that the same Southeast Floridians who could potentially polarize over climate change broadly agree, on a bipartisan basis, with statements like the following: “local and state officials should be involved in identifying steps that local communities can take to reduce the risk posed by rising sea levels.”
“What matters is not the word, it's the conversation,” said Kahan of the compact and how it handles the climate issue. “And they have a conversation in which they engage people about the ‘climate change' they all recognize has something to do with how they live.”
“They don't engage them in a way that makes the topic the ‘climate change' that determines whose side you're on,” he continues.
None of which is to say that Florida's path into a climate-altered future can ever be an easy one. The state has seen a fortunate dearth of major hurricane landfalls in recent years, but all future storms will be coasting atop rising seas, with the potential to fling them farther inland. Moreover, there's dismaying evidence that the contributions to sea level rise from the planet's great ice sheets atop Greenland and Antarctica may have been underestimated — meaning that sea level projections could keep rising.
But as Patty Asseff likes to say, “baby steps.” After visiting Jorge Ferrer's house, she drives me to the waterside along Hollywood's South Lake, where recently installed flap gates have been inserted into existing drainage systems to prevent flooding when water levels rise.
It used to be that at some high tides, water would “backflow” from the lakes and waterways up through drains and spill out into neighborhoods. But now, a simple one-way valve lets rainwater flow down and out without letting tidal water push back in the opposite direction. Nine such gates have been installed in South Lake, with three to go; another 12 may soon need to go in in the nearby North Lake neighborhood, according to the city's Department of Public Utilities.
And thus, even as seas rise, Hollywood just got a little bit better protected — and people can resume their sun-drenched lives. For now.
“If somebody gave you a house around here, I bet you'd take it,” laughs Asseff. “And just deal with the consequences.”

Brutal news for Mets left-hander Jerry Blevins.
Blevins was making enough progress in his recovery from a distal radius fracture in his left arm suffered in April that the Mets were hoping to have him as a bullpen option in September.
Instead he'll miss the remainder of the season and will require surgery after slipping while stepping off a curb Monday and re-fracturing the same bone.
Blevins tossed five scoreless innings for the Mets prior to the injury and has a 3.53 ERA with 309 strikeouts in 329 career innings as a big leaguer. He was acquired from the Nationals this offseason in exchange for outfielder Matt den Dekker.
New York added to its southpaw reliever depth by getting Eric O'Flaherty from Oakland prior to knowing the severity of the Blevins news, so he'll join Rule 5 pick Sean Gilmartin as the Mets' primary lefties.

While you might think Easter's all about coloured eggs and chocolate, lamb, bunnies and baskets full of sweet things, I think it's about cheesecake.
I have no idea when the association came to me and why it stuck. But really, does anyone need a reason for cheesecake? And certainly, no one needs an excuse to make one. All you need is a foolproof recipe.
Having grown up in New York, I've been making it the same way for years: really tall, really rich and creamy. Then, a couple of weeks ago, perhaps in the season's spirit of renewal, I tinkered with my original recipe, one made with cream cheese and sour cream. What began on a whim finished as a quest. I was searching for a cheesecake that would be as impressive and as satisfying as my standby, but I wanted a different texture: something a little lighter, a little less dense, and with more spring, sponge and fluff.
I got all that by adding ricotta to the mix, specifically by swapping some of the cream cheese for a lot of ricotta. Mixing the two cheeses gave the cake the richness and creaminess that are the hallmarks of the genre plus the lightness I was looking for. I also added grated lemon and orange zest and a full tablespoon of vanilla extract, ingredients that round the flavour of eggs and make anything rich seem magically less so. Those additions might explain why my more moderate friends around the table cut thin slices and then went back for seconds. Like many seducers, the cake is not what it seems.
Making cheesecake is for the patient. It needs a long bake, a long cool and a long chill; making cheesecake with ricotta is for the very patient, because the ricotta must drain before you use it. If you've never drained ricotta before, you'll be surprised at the amount of liquid it gives up – liquid that, if it weren't removed, would spoil the texture of your cake.
In the ideal cheesecake world, you'd wrap the ricotta in cheesecloth, make a kind of hobo sack and let it hang overnight, its weight providing the pressure needed to push the liquid out. I don't have a ricotta-hanging hook in my kitchen, so I do what you'll probably do: Wrap the cheese, put it in a strainer, set the strainer over a bowl and then weight the cheese down with a heavy can of something. (Last week I used a jar of half-sour pickles.)
Don't skip that step.
Because I'm a checks-and-balances kind of baker, I've added cornstarch to the batter. It's there as an in-the-background sopper-upper, slurping up and absorbing any excess moisture from the ricotta and helping to ensure the cake has a gorgeous texture.
So here's what you should know:
– You'll need a 9- or 10-inch springform pan for this batter, which will firm up and almost always rise above the rim of the pan, then settle down.
– Beat, beat and then beat some more. By the time you pour the batter into the pan, the cream cheese and ricotta should have gone from solid to something resembling liquid satin. This is a great job for a stand mixer, although you can make it with a handheld mixer. (I learned to make cheesecake with a spoon and elbow grease and have never made it that way again.)
– The cake bakes slowly in a water bath called a bain-marie; it's a roasting pan filled with hot water. This is the gentlest way of baking such a big cake made with such delicate ingredients. Once the cake is baked, it has to hang out in the turned-off oven for another hour. This is a must: Cheesecakes don't like sudden shifts in temperature.
– And then it has to hang some more. The cake needs to come to room temperature before it's chilled. You could serve it at room temperature, but cheesecake is better chilled; overnight is best. That it can be frozen only makes us love it more.
I typically serve cheesecake plain. Call me silly, but I love the simplicity of its looks. But hey, it's a holiday, so think about crowning it with berries. Or, if you'd like, serving it with a sauce: berry, chocolate or caramel.
This cake could work for Passover next month, too: Just use kosher-for-Passover potato starch instead of cornstarch in the batter and matzo meal instead of graham crackers or bread crumbs for lining the pan; this cheesecake doesn't really have a crust. And any time of year, you can make it gluten-free by choosing a different crumb.
Wishing you joy and cheesecake for Easter.
DORIE GREENSPAN'S LIGHT AND CREAMY EASTER CHEESECAKE
Make ahead: It's important to drain the ricotta for 6 to 12 hours; you can't get the wonderful light, slightly spongy texture otherwise. Overnight would be best. And it's also best to give the finished cake a bunch of time to chill. In other words, this is a plan-ahead cake.
From cookbook author Dorie Greenspan.
for the cheesecake:
2 lbs whole-milk ricotta
unsalted butter, for greasing the pan
3 to 4 tbsp graham cracker crumbs or plain dried bread crumbs (see headnote)
1 cup sugar
1/2 tsp fine sea salt
1 lemon
1 orange (may substitute 2 clementines or other small oranges)
24 oz (three 8-oz packages) cream cheese, cut into chunks
1/4 cup cornstarch, sifted (see headnote)
3 large eggs
1 tbsp pure vanilla extract
for the optional topping:
2 to 3 tbsp honey
12 oz blueberries, raspberries or blackberries, or a combination
1. For the cheesecake: Line a strainer with a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth. (Use a big piece; you want a lot of overhangs.) Place the lined strainer over a pot or bowl, spoon in the ricotta and draw up the sides of cheesecloth to cover it. Put a plate on top of the ricotta, then place a large can or bottle on top of the plate to put pressure on the cheese. Let it sit on the counter overnight (or refrigerate). When you're ready to bake, remove the weights, unwrap the cheese and pat it dry.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Grease the springform pan with some butter and dust it with the crumbs. Wrap the exterior of the pan with a double layer of aluminum foil, bringing the foil as high up the sides of the pan as you can. Set out a roasting pan that's large enough to hold the springform pan.
3. Combine the sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl if you're using a hand mixer) and finely grate the rind of the lemon and orange over it. (Save the fruit for another use.) Use your fingers to rub the zest into the sugar until the sugar is moist, fragrant and coloured. If you're using a stand mixer, attach the bowl and the paddle. Toss in the cream cheese and beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl occasionally (do this throughout the process), for 4 minutes. Add the drained ricotta and beat for 4 minutes more. All this beating gives the cheesecake its light texture. Stop the mixer to add the cornstarch, then beat on low speed to incorporate it. Add the eggs one a time, beating on medium speed for a minute after each one goes in, then add the vanilla extract and beat just to incorporate. Pour and scrape the batter into the springform pan, using a spatula to level the top.
4. Seat the springform pan in the roasting pan, then transfer to the middle oven rack. Pour hot water into the roasting pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake for 90 minutes (for a 10-inch pan; 15 minutes longer if using a 9-inch pan) without opening the oven door, then turn off the oven, prop the door open with a wooden spoon and allow the cake to rest in its water bath for 1 hour. The cake probably will have risen above the rim of the pan; it will settle down as it cools. The surface also may have cracked; that is not a problem.
5. Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Carefully lift the springform pan out of the roaster – there might be hot water in the foil, so pay attention! Remove and discard the foil, place the springform pan on a wire rack and let the cheesecake come to room temperature. The centre of the cake may still be jiggly, and that's fine. Once the cake has cooled completely, refrigerate it for at least 6 hours or, better yet, overnight.
6. Remove the sides of the springform pan. If the cake has stuck to the sides – it probably won't, because this is a well-behaved cake – warm the pan with a hair dryer or a dish towel soaked in hot water and then wrung dry. Place the cake, still on the pan's base, on a platter.
7. For the optional topping: Warm the honey (to taste) very briefly in a microwave or over low heat, just to liquefy it – it shouldn't be really hot – and then brush a very thin layer over the top of the cake. Arrange the berries decoratively atop the cake, or mix them together and pile them on top of the cake. Drizzle a small amount of honey over the berries to give them a shine.
8. To serve, use a long knife to cut the cake, dipping the knife in hot water and wiping it dry between cuts.

BDO number one Glen Durrant and World Trophy holder Darryl Fitton booked their places in the last 16 of the SINGHA Beer Grand Slam of Darts after prevailing in winner-takes-all clashes tonight.
The final matches in Groups A, D, E and H took place at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall, with defending champion Michael van Gerwen and reigning PDC world champion Gary Anderson both finishing top of their respective groups.
Benito van de Pas took top spot in Group H, while Phil Taylor finished in pole position in Group D despite a surprising 5-0 defeat to Darren Webster in his final group game.
Current World Masters champion Durrant booked his place in the last 16 with a 5-0 whitewash over Nathan Derry.
The BDO number one, making his debut in the cross-code tournament, averaged 97.60 and took out 150 as he secured runners-up spot in Group E.
Anderson, runner-up in the Grand Slam in 2011, made it three wins from three to top Group E with a comfortable 5-2 win over Alan Norris.
Van Gerwen came through the group stages with maximum points, as a 5-1 win against Max Hopp saw him top Group A.
The defeat for Hopp meant he was relying on the result in the final Group A match between Brendan Dolan and Martin Adams, which saw the former come from behind to pip the German to the runners-up spot.
Three-time BDO world champion Adams needed to win 5-2 or better, and at 3-2 up still had a chance of getting the result he needed to reach the knockout stages for a second consecutive year.
But Northern Ireland's Dolan then reeled off three legs on the spin to triumph 5-3 and snatch the last qualifying place up for grabs in Group A.
Adrian Lewis finished with a tournament average of more than 102 as he bowed out of the Grand Slam in the group stages for the sixth time in 10 years.
Van de Pas was a 5-2 victor over the two-time world champion to finish top of Group H with maximum points, while Lewis left Wolverhampton without a point to his name.
Chris Dobey continued his breakthrough year after toppling former world champion Scott Mitchell 5-3 to finish runner-up in Group H and progress to the last 16 of a TV tournament for the first time.
Six-time Grand Slam winner Taylor had already qualified for the knockout stage heading into his final Group D encounter with Webster, but was handed a 5-0 thrashing by the Norfolk thrower, ranked 40th on the PDC Order of Merit.
The final qualifying place up for grabs in Group D went to the BDO's Fitton, who battled back from 4-2 down to beat Ian White 5-4 in a nervy final game of the day.

This week, I visited the home of legendary car company Rolls-Royce in the south of England. Over the course of its 110-year history, the Rolls-Royce name has come to define what luxury means, both in the world of automobiles and beyond. If you haven't already, go and read my full report on how the recently resurrected Rolls-Royce is carrying on its fine tradition and legacy, and then come back here for all the eye candy from my tour of the factory floor. There are plenty of fun factoids scattered throughout as well, such as how the Starlight Headliner is made (and what it actually is) plus the reasons why Rolls-Royce has an anechoic test chamber and refuses to use anything other than Scandinavian bull hides for its leather upholstery.
<<< NEWS FROM THE LAB - Tuesday, January 21, 2014 >>> ARCHIVES | SEARCH Policeware  good or bad? Posted by Micke @ 17:09 GMT The malware scene is changing constantly, and one of the remarkable changes is that today the bad guys might be the good guys. That is, the guys who were supposed to be good. To express it slightly less confusing, authorities have become one of the major malware players and US agencies are already the world's largest buyers of exploits.
This makes an old ethical question for us malware fighters more important than ever. How to deal with policeware? Should this kind of malware be detected or not? F-Secure's stance has been clear. Yes, we do detect any kind of malware. And no, we do not keep any whitelists for authorities' policeware. We have not received any requests to whitelist policeware, and we would refuse to do so if requested.
This might raise mixed feelings as there no doubt are cases where the police work for our common good. There are dangerous criminals that should be behind bars, so why not use any available weapon against them? Aren't we protecting them by refusing to whitelist policeware? Let's take a closer look at the problem and we'll see why there really is no alternative to our current policy.
Why is it a bad idea for an anti-malware vendor to whitelist policeware?
• Authorities' powers are always restricted to a defined geography, but our anti-malware technology is used globally. There is no reliable way for the scanner engine to verify that the policeware is used within its author's jurisdiction.
• Legit warrants always define the suspect. But our anti-malware technology is generic for all customers and can't verify that the policeware is used against the right target.
• When encountering a whitelisted file, our scanner can't verify who is controlling it and who it reports back to. Whitelisting would be irresponsible as real malware could sneak through that way.
• We have an obligation to protect our customers from malware as well as we can. That's what we promise when selling the product. We could naturally make an exception in cases where there is a valid warrant against the user. But as stated above, it is impossible to verify that condition.
• Laws are different in every country. The policeware might be legal in one country but illegal in another. This is complex and unfeasible for us to investigate.
• Which countries' authorities should we serve? We might trust our own country's police, but what about Spain, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Egypt, China, North Korea or USA? Just to mention some randomly picked countries. Should we serve them too? How can we verify that they have legit motives for using spying tools?
• If policeware is misused without an appropriate warrant or otherwise against the law, we have a moral obligation to inform the victim. Otherwise we take part in the crime.
So the problem is really that valid warrants target a well-defined individual or group, but a whitelisting of policeware would be targeting our whole user-base globally. That makes the downside of whitelisting magnitudes larger than the upside.
But that's not all. Here's why it is an even worse idea for agencies to ask for whitelisting.
• Whitelisting requires us to know what to whitelist. The policeware must have a unique and reliable identification mechanism. A core goal for malware is to be as hard as possible to detect, and such an identifier will make the policeware easier to detect and less effective. It could be used for both white- and blacklisting.
• Whitelisting forces agencies to reveal details about their policeware programs to outsiders, which increase the risk for leaks. They also need to reveal the mere existence of the program. Keep in mind that they would need to talk to many anti-malware vendors to get effective whitelisting, not just to us.
• The reliable identifier needed to whitelist policeware ties it to the agency. It gives the suspects a way to know that they are being watched by the authorities. A malware infection that is detected could otherwise blend in with the overall malware threat and not necessary alert the suspects.
• As recent news coverage reveal, a significant part of the policeware seems to be outright illegal or at least on shaky ground. This makes it even less sensible for the agencies to talk to outsiders about it.
The best strategy for agencies is to play the same game as the bad boys. To change the policeware constantly and try to fly under the anti-malware products' radar. When their program gets caught, they change it and try again, and the target may think it was an ordinary malware attack. Law enforcement agencies have plenty of resources and are well able to play this game successfully. And many criminals are probably not that tech savvy. Even big organized gangs might operate without properly protected computers. Reality is not like in the movies where the villain is both a global drug dealer and a super-hacker at the same time. Many criminals are soft targets even without whitelisting policeware.
Our policy to never whitelist is old already, but today it's more important than ever. The police used to be trustworthy in the good old days. Warrants and targeted actions against suspects have been seen as a legit part of crime-fighting. It's sad to see how this traditional police work blends into secret mass surveillance with totally different motives. It's not only sad, it's scary as this is creating a chasm between citizens and the authorities.
With this in mind, it is easy to see why a strict policy against whitelisting really is the only alternative. It has always been an easy choice, now it is a no-brainer.

The United States is a nation quarreling with itself right now. Most of the country's population wants to keep the internet an equitable and free place, embracing net neutrality rules as a necessary guardian against corporate overreach. But the current political administration seems hellbent on dismantling net neutrality and handing internet service providers the freedom to mold, shape, manipulate, and price internet access in whatever fashion they like. The downsides to this regulatory repeal are too numerous and appalling to list, but you don't have to agree that it's a bad idea to see something else important about it: whatever the American authorities do with respect to the internet will have major repercussions for the rest of the world as well.
This seemingly internal fight overflows US borders in a number of important ways. Here are the two key aspects that trouble me, as someone who doesn't reside in the US but interacts with a panoply of its internet services as a matter of daily and professional routine:
The rest of the world looks to America to set the example
You might think that, under the Trump administration, the United States has done a lot less leading than in generations past. Certainly, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, shunning Cuba after Obama had normalized relations, and looking to rescind the Iran nuclear deal are all signs of a country looking inward. But just because the US isn't leading doesn't mean that others aren't following. A butterfly flapping its wings in the US tends to cause a rippling of effects in the countries looking to the States for guidance.
I'm not talking about France or the Netherlands here. Countries with a modern, well developed, and functioning jurisprudence can navigate their own way through the challenges of regulating internet access. They're far less likely (though not immune) to be swayed by events and decisions taking place in the United States. Especially under Emmanuel Macron's leadership, France wants to be seen as a more enlightened, more welcoming alternative to a United States that seems to be losing its religious and cultural tolerance. But France is part of a very small exception.
The countries most susceptible to being misled by the United States' bad example in terms of internet regulation are those who treat American culture as a guiding light, as something superior to their own. I come from Bulgaria, and that's exactly the phenomenon that's been at play there for most of my lifetime: when the communist regime was removed in 1989, its place was taken up by a corruption-riddled economic liberalism and a deluge of American cultural exports. The first time a McDonald's outlet opened in my nearest city, it was treated like the opening of a Michelin-starred restaurant. And yes, we have Black Friday deals even without the Thanksgiving tradition, just like most of the rest of the world.
Bulgaria is only one example of dozens of countries that are broadly grouped together in the “developing” category. We look for external examples, for best practices when handling complex matters like the internet, and the US is the obvious first port of call. It's where Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and most of the other tech companies we admire hail from. We may not follow the US example with things like health care and capital punishment — because we also have millennia of experience with both — but given how the US practically invented the internet we know now, it seems reasonable to expect that its regulatory system must be operating in the most efficient manner possible. Right?
Among the budding nations looking for a role model is India, which is still formulating its approach to net neutrality. Facebook has already trampled over net neutrality principles in the country with its zero-rated Free Basics, though the Indian authorities effectively banned the practice with a ruling last year. Where India goes from here will be of major significance for the future, given the country's huge population and rapid growth in the number of people getting online. Could Indian net neutrality rules survive in the context of a US stripped of all net neutrality protections?
Online services may become more expensive outside the US if they are more expensive to provide in the US
A big problem with internet infrastructure within the US is a lack of competition between providers. It's true that no ISP owns the entire US market, but the way they've arranged their services is such that de facto monopolies exist in various municipalities. Recode's Albert Wenger, for instance, has only one provider choice in Manhattan (also known as: no choice at all!), whereas a Londoner like me could pick from BT, Virgin, Sky, TalkTalk, Plusnet, mobile companies dabbling in home broadband like EE and Vodafone, and a smattering of smaller providers.
The aberrantly uncompetitive US ISP market leads to situations where someone like Comcast or Spectrum can effectively dictate whatever terms it likes to its customers. The only protection against that is government regulation, installing rules of conduct for these providers to follow. Without net neutrality, an unshackled Comcast can start putting together nightmarish (by which I mean “just like cable TV”) tiers or bundles of internet access that will be good for Comcast's bottom line, but bad for consumers and bad for online services.
If Netflix and Amazon are forced to pay additional fees to have their streaming services included in Comcast's “good” bundles, the end result is that we, the consumers, will bear that cost. And since Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are international services, those costs are likely to trickle down to unsuspecting customers beyond the US as well.
Another, more ephemeral, issue that arises from the absence of net neutrality is that companies like Netflix need to develop the necessary skill and tool set to navigate an internet that doesn't guarantee a level playing field. That means hiring people adept at negotiating deals with internet providers, and it means figuring out ways to leverage and exploit the lack of neutrality. Netflix has already been dabbling with that, flip-flopping on whether it supports net neutrality or not. Developing the requisite expertise to compete on an unequal footing costs time and money, but once Netflix has it for the US market, it's going to be much more likely to seek to export it overseas and make the most of it. In this way, an unregulated US internet would feed directly into a push to instill the same legal environment elsewhere.
Is this really what we want the internet to become? A place full of ignoble economic incentives driving companies to engage in ethically dubious anticompetitive behavior? Internet service providers are doing pretty well in the US even with the currently extant net neutrality laws, which exist mostly to curb those companies' worst impulses.
Why should we distort and disfigure the economics of internet access — something so essential to modern life that countries now treat it as a legal right — just to appease companies that face no threat of going out of business? The global influence of the United States, and of American online companies, also means that repealing net neutrality within the country's borders would pose an existential threat to net neutrality around the world.

Emmanuel Macron, France's liberal former economy minister and a leading candidate for president, has a message for U.S. climate researchers who are worried about the fate of their research under President Trump: “Please, come to France, you are welcome."
In a video posted on Twitter and Facebook on Thursday, Macron contrasted his commitment to fighting global warming with the U.S. president's skepticism. Trump has said that “nobody really knows" whether climate change is real, and last month he met with William Happer, a Princeton physicist who argues that climate change may be good for the world. The new administration and GOP-led Congress have also proposed policies perceived as attempts to stifle government scientists.
“I do know how your new president now has decided to jeopardize your budget, your initiatives, as he is extremely skeptical of climate change," Macron said. “I have no doubt about climate change, and how committed we have to be regarding this issue."
I have a message for you guys. #ScienceMarch pic.twitter.com/ZnkFIIksdx — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) February 10, 2017
Macron labeled his tweet with the hashtag #ScienceMarch — presumably to get the attention of the more than 800,000 people who say they plan to attend a rally in Washington or satellite marches in April to advocate for science.
The same hashtag was appended to a video from a campaign rally Saturday, when Macron told “researchers, academics and companies in the United States fighting obscurantism and who are afraid today … you now have a new homeland: France." The declaration was met with a long round of cheers, applause and waving of French and European Union flags.
Macron may get an opportunity to make good on his promise. A recent poll placed him second among the crowded field of presidential candidates, according to Reuters. If he does make it to the second round of voting, a two-way runoff scheduled for May 7, he would beat far-right candidate Marine Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote, the poll found.
Macron is the most progressive of the front-runners in the presidential race. A cabinet member for former Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls, he left the government last year to start his own party, En Marche! The party's platform is strongly pro-European and includes a commitment to developing renewable energy.
But it might take more than that to entice American scientists to leave their labs in the United States. As Science magazine pointed out, French spending on research is less than that in the United States, and French researchers frequently take to the streets to protest budget cuts and bureaucratic obstacles.

Celebrity atheist Richard Dawkins believes that two of America's presidents share his same religious perspective.
“Like many people, I'm sure that [President Barack] Obama is an atheist,” Dawkins told Bill Maher on Friday. “I'm sure Kennedy was an atheist. But I doubt Pope Frank is, no. He's obviously a nice man, therefore a dangerous man. We don't want nice men in the Vatican.”
Dawkins' comments come amid a new book revealing how Obama's Christian faith has aided him at times during his presidency. White House spiritual advisor Joshua DuBois' book, The President's Devotional: The Daily Readings That Inspired President Obama, showcased how at pivotal moments, Obama leans on prayer as a grounding mechanism.
"I've certainly seen the president's faith grow in his time in office," DuBois told the AP last week. "When you cultivate your faith, it grows."
As for atheism in politics, it is a rare sight. Back in September, HuffPost Politics looked at how the current 113th Congress has zero admitted atheists. A few months after he retired, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) admitted his nonbeliever status. Former Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.) had been the only avowed atheist, but he left office in 2012.
UPDATE (10/29/13, 9:15 a.m.): In the "Overtime" portion of the segment, Maher asked Dawkins if the United States would elect an atheist president during the next couple of decades. Dawkins responded that he was "kind of joking" when he said that Obama and Kennedy were definitely atheists. He also stressed that statistically speaking, he did not think that every member of Congress could be religious.
"I couldn't be prouder of our expert clinicians and hospital staff": Jillian Skinner. Credit:Janie Barrett "NSW cares for the largest caseload of patients in the country ... I couldn't be prouder of our expert clinicians and hospital staff and I thank them for the wonderful work they do to achieve these results," Ms Skinner said. But Australian Medical Association NSW president Brad Frankum warned the rising tide of presentations and surgery waiting lists was further straining an already stretched health system. "The tsunami of patients presenting at emergency departments and being admitted to hospital is one way the federal government's failures to invest properly in general practice manifests," Dr Frankum said. "The staff across the system are doing a wonderful job looking after people, but this squeezing of efficiency can't go on forever," he said.
Emergency departments 'bursting at the seams' Emergency departments had a huge increase in presentations, having over 7,000 more visits than the same period last year. Almost one in four patients (23.7 per cent) who presented to EDs weren't treated within the clinically appropriate timeframe and there were marked increases in the most serious triage cases. The number of patients who needed treatment within 10 minutes (triage 2) rose by 3000, a 4.2 per cent increase on the same period last year. People needing treatment within 30 minutes (triage 3) rose by 7800 (3.8 per cent), while the number of less serious presentations dropped by more than two per cent.
"Frankly, it worries me that we are seeing this marked increase in very sick people," Dr Frankum said. "The pressure to deal with sicker, more complex cases is a recipe for mistakes and problems," he said. Nepean Hospital, one of the busiest EDs in the state, fared considerably worse over the last quarter than any other hospital and had more than half of patients (51.8 per cent) waiting longer than four hours. "We are on track to improve our performance with 55 per cent of patients spending less than four hours in the ED during July 2016," a spokesperson for the Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District said. Labor health spokesman Walt Secord said it was more evidence that Nepean Hospital was "bursting at the seams".
"Nepean Hospital is at breaking point and, with the expected increase in population, this means waits will get longer and longer in Sydney's west," Mr Secord said. Biggest ever rise in admissions The rise in the number of admissions from EDs was another telling sign that hospitals were treating sicker, more resource-intensive patients. About 8500 more patients were admitted compared with the same quarter in 2015, a 4.8 per cent jump. "It's the biggest increase the BHI has ever seen," said the chief executive of the Bureau of Health Information, Dr Jean-Frederic Levesque, whose organisation has been compiling the data for the past six years. "The reasons could be the ageing population, an increase in the prevalence of people with chronic diseases, but also potentially factors related to their access to primary care," Dr Levesque said.
The federal government's continued attack on primary care, including the GP rebate freeze and failure to appropriately fund the sector could be driving people to EDs in worse health, Dr Frankum said. "We know that better primary care will take more pressure off the hospital system," he said. Non-urgent surgeries take a back seat About 4000 more elective surgeries were performed over the 90-day period compared with the same 2015 quarter, as the sector tried to whittle down the state's waiting lists, the longest in the country. The number of people waiting longer than 365 days for surgery dropped from 596 in last year's equivalent quarter to just 158.
But as surgeons worked to treat the more serious cases on time, fewer non-urgent cases made it to the operating table. An additional 400 non-urgent patients waited more than a year for surgery compared with the same quarter last year. Nepean Hospital also recorded the worst elective surgery treatment times. Despite increasing the number of surgeries at the hospital by 14 per cent, fewer than 81 per cent were performed on time, leaving one in five patients waiting longer than clinically recommended for their operations. Just 71 per cent of non-urgent surgeries were performed on time. The spokesperson for NBMLHD said it had taken action to help meet the growing demand for services in the area. "These strategies have helped us to provide elective surgery for 6154 patients in 2015/2016. At the end of June 2016, Nepean Hospital had only one overdue patient."
The report found marked improvements in the times it took for paramedics to hand over patients to ED staff: a 6.1 per cent increase in the proportion of patients transferred within 30 minutes, taking the state average to 91.6 per cent. The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital was a star achiever, lifting its game by 25 percentage points to 94.5 per cent for transfers within 30 minutes.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson a couple of hours ago:
Just a few teeny tiny issues with that one.
Firstly, as we all know by now, there was no “tax grab” in the budget. Not one single Scot had their taxes increased in any way whatsoever. Indeed, a person whose wages haven't changed will pay slightly LESS tax this year than they did last year, because their personal allowance has gone up and everything else has stayed the same.
(That didn't stop the Sunday Times from punting the same lie, of course – sneaking it casually into a story about something else entirely, in the way the media likes to do with things it knows aren't true but which it wants people to believe anyway.)
And secondly, the budget was revealed on Thursday, which was the 2nd of February. But when did Panelbase ask people for their voting intentions?
Ah. A week to two weeks BEFORE the tax measures were known. And it's not even the first time Davidson's had some trouble reading the data from that same poll:
Because as all alert readers will know, what it actually found was support for a second referendum at some point within the next two years is currently at 50%, not 27%.
And there's even more. Despite Davidson's claims, the poll DOESN'T show a 3% drop for the SNP and a 6% rise for the Tories. Compared to the previous Panelbase poll on Westminster voting intention – in September 2016 – the SNP haven't dropped at all. They're still on the same 47%, with the Tories up just 3%, from 24%.
So that's THREE falsehoods in a single tweet – there was no “tax grab”, the poll was before the budget not after it, and the change numbers are wrong by a factor of 100%.
Nice try, though. We think we begin to see where David Torrance gets it from.
Rep Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) - screenshot
While police were still involved in a shootout with man who invaded a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood office, a Republican lawmaker attacked the organization saying he would expect an apology if the shooter didn't turn out to be an anti-abortion terrorist.
Appearing on CNN, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) took offense at a statement issued by CEO of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains, Vicki Cowart — who said that the clinic might have been targeted by an extremist — and stated that he would be expecting an apology if she was proved wrong.
Before police apprehended Robert Lewis Dear — who killed three and wounded nine at the women's health clinic in Colorado — Cowart, released a statement saying, in part: “We don't yet know the full circumstances and motives behind this criminal action, and we don't yet know if Planned Parenthood was in fact the target of this attack. We share the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country. We will never back away from providing care in a safe, supportive environment that millions of people rely on and trust.”
Kinzinger found Cowart's statement unsettling.
“When I heard that statement, I thought that was very premature. We may find out this person was targeting Planned Parenthood, “the conservative lawmaker said. “If we find out he was not targeting Planned Parenthood, I would fully expect an apology from the Planned Parenthood director for saying that.”
He then went on to attack Planned Parenthood over the discredited videos produced by an an anti-abortion group that claimed the health organization was “harvesting” fetal parts for profit.
“Regardless, if somebody is targeting Planned Parenthood, it's not indicative of what folks that are opposed to what some of the practices Planned Parenthood commits,” Kinzinger said. “We saw these barbaric videos and that is something many of us have a legitimate concern about. That doesn't mean we're gonna take guns and walk into Planned Parenthood clinics.”

A Japanese man elevated the human race to an entirely new level this past weekend by marrying his videogame girlfriend.
Nene Anegasaki and a Japanese man known as Sal9000 finally got married this past weekend, normally cause for celebration, except for the the fact that Nene Anegasaki is not an actual human; she only exists in the Nintendo DS videogame Love Plus. Sal9000 still "married" her, in a real ceremony that took place in Guam, probably one of the only places you can marry an imaginary being that lives in an electronic device.
The reception was held in Japan, with many attendees that were able to watch slides and other strange behavior. The accompanying video is of Sal9000 kissing his bride, currently appearing to be housed in a Nintendo DSi LL/XL, the new humongous version of the DS that was just released in Japan. Evidently, Sal9000 spares no expense on his wife, already upgrading her to the latest hardware.
Love Plus includes three girls, allowing the player to take them out on dates and to interact with them in various ways to attempt to earn their love. Once you do, you've got a companion for life. It's basically like Nintendogs, but it's not illegal to take the relationship one step further.
From the coverage of this marriage, I get the feeling that it is somewhat of a joke. At the same time, I'm not sure what to think at all. I know that there were people around the internet at one time or another that wanted to marry Sonic the Hedgehog, so at the least this is much better than that. If someone's happiness comes from marrying a set of instructions and pixels programmed into a videogame, I'm fine with that, but if this is real Sal9000 has likely ended his chances of ever getting a real girlfriend.

AP Jan Munk, director of the Theresienstadt memorial site, with one of the damaged monuments.
Semi-precious metal, as it happens, is everywhere. It can be found on church roofs; copper pipes run through many a house wall; and wiring is almost ubiquitous. Scrap metal thieves, though, have recently discovered a valuable new source of copper: Cemeteries and memorials.
This week, a particularly audacious bandit apparently made off with over 1,000 bronze plaques from the Holocaust memorial Theresienstadt just outside of Prague. The plaques were emblazoned with the names of prisoners who died at the Nazi concentration camp there -- and Czech police said this week that many of them had been discovered at a scrapyard in northern Czech Republic.
The theft, said Czech Culture Minister Vaclav Jehlicka, "has disgraced the memory of World War II victims irrespective of whether it was committed on the basis of a pervert ideology or purely for gain of money." Damage is estimated to be about 1 million korunas, or about 40,000 ($63,600).
Jehlicka said that the plaques would be replaced, but that the new tablets would be made of resin instead of bronze, a copper alloy. The remaining bronze plates, he said, would likewise be replaced at a cost of several million korunas.
The theft comes at a time when rising scrap metal prices have resulted in a spate of scrap metal thefts, with copper being high on the list. One hundred kilograms of copper brings in 430 on the scrap market, leading to a number of churches in Germany and Europe having their roofs and gutters stolen. A number of bronze vases and candelabras went missing from a Berlin graveyard recently and a Cologne cemetery lost 16 Madonna statues made of metal.
Indeed, Canada is considering doing away with its penny, partially as a result of the high scrap metal prices. The coins are worth more than scrap than their face value. And in Cleveland, according to the New York Times, a number of homes have been gutted of copper fittings recently, leading to homebuilders and remodelers to put signs in front of building sites indicating that only PVC plastic piping is being used instead of copper.
Theresienstadt, known as Terezin in Czech, has indicated that the plaques are not likely to be replaced before the May 18 annual commemoration of Nazi victims there. During World War II, the camp at Theresienstadt served as a collection point for Jews from where they were deported to death camps further east. A fortress nearby served as a Gestapo prison.

SHORT PUMP, Va. -- A mother and daughter got quite a surprise when they walked into Walmart Tuesday night.
Denise Collier-Bailey said she just noticed two men sitting in the vestibule of the Short Pump superstore.
It wasn't until she actually walked inside the store that her daughter asked, "Did you see that deer in the shopping cart?"
Collier-Bailey had not, so she and her teenage daughter walked back out to get a closer look.
The daughter took a photo.
The gutted deer, was in the shopping cart, dripping blood on the floor, she said.
"The things you see at Walmart!" she said in a phone interview Wednesday. "This just topped it all."
Collier-Bailey said she did not bother the men and just went back into Walmart after taking the photos.
"We were just... I couldn't believe it," Collier-Bailey said.
Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed the incident.
He said a customer alerted store management and a manager quickly told the men to take their deer and go.
Crowson did not know why the men rolled the dead deer into Walmart, but made it clear the carcass never made it into the shopping areas of the store.
Commenters on the WTVR CBS 6 Facebook page reported they had seen a deer running around the area earlier that evening. One even reported the deer had been hit and killed by a vehicle near Walmart.
Lee Walker, with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, speculated the men might be hunters simply trying to follow Virginia law.
"It appears that they were trying to follow the law by checking in the harvested deer, but were not at an approved check station," Walker said. "In most cases hunters do not bring harvested game actually into an approved checked station, but rather have someone from the store come out to verify the harvest and to record the needed information."

Main deer hunting season, in much of the state, runs through January 2.

Yahoo has been under pressure for years to bolster its flagging core business — which include its search and content operations — and that has proven a difficult task for Mayer. In fact, Yahoo's board took bids on the sale of its core assets in recent days.
"Our board, our management team, and I are completely aligned on this top priority for shareholders," Mayer said of the pursuit of a potential sale.
Re/code reported earlier Tuesday that bidders included Verizon — whose interest had long been telegraphed — private equity firm TPG, and a joint offer from Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners.
According to The Wall Street Journal, most of the bids came in the range of between $4 billion and $8 billion.
On the "strategic alternatives" front, Yahoo said that its board has "formed a strategic review committee of independent directors to consider strategic alternatives for the company alongside its continued consideration of a reverse spin."
"Since the launch of the process in February, management has worked diligently with the committee and its independent legal and financial advisors to engage with interested strategic and financial parties," Yahoo said in its Tuesday release.
In December, the company shelved its planned spin-off of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Yahoo then said in February that it would consider a "reverse spin," wherein it would effectively separate its core assets from its Alibaba holdings.
The strategic review committee is "leading a well-run process to achieve the best possible outcome for our shareholders," Mayer said on Yahoo's earnings webcast, adding that her team is "moving expeditiously." In fact, she said, Yahoo management participates in daily calls and meetings with the committee.
"I personally believe that the right transaction could unlock tremendous value," the CEO added, explaining that strategic synergies and the separation of equity stakes (like that in Alibaba) from business operations could help shareholders.
Mayer also explained that her team has sought to run a "high-quality process designed to keep interested parties engaged," and that has included assembling data and compiling a management presentation.
"Our efforts to date reflect clear, decisive action to move forward quickly and in a way that we believe will yield enhanced value," she said, potentially responding to some complaints that her team may be dragged its feet on pursuing a sale.
She hinted that interested parties have included "some of the most well-known, respected names in the industry."
Concluding her statement on the strategic review, Mayer said the company does not intend to provide further comments or updates on specific details "to preserve the value and integrity of the process."
As part of her plan to build Yahoo's future, Mayer has pushed growth in "Mavens" — a term that stands for mobile, video, native and social operations. But mobile revenue has been relatively slow to expand, with even struggling Twitter exhibiting more growth.
Media figures expressed alarm on Friday after Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Department of Justice is reviewing current policies about subpoenaing reporters as part of the investigation into leaks of classified information.
” I have listened to career investigators and prosecutors about how to most successfully investigate and prosecute these matters. At their suggestion, one of the things we are doing is reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas,” Sessions said at a press conference Friday morning.
“We respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited. They cannot place lives at risk with impunity. We must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in our intelligence community, the armed forces, and all law abiding Americans.”
Sessions' announcement was not received well in the media.
“Shorter Sessions: Because he can't recuse himself on Russia, he'll jail reporters instead,” said Market Watch's Washington bureau chief, Steve Goldstein.
“Sessions tells room of reporters he may make it easier to jail them if they don't reveal sources, leaves without taking any press questions,” said MSNBC host Ari Melber.
NBC News' Ken Dilanian called Sessions' announcement “a significant development for anyone who cares about press freedom.”
New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski described Sessions' speech as “authoritarian-style threats.” Kovaleski's message to Sessions: “Get ready for even greater, tougher resolve!”
“Sessions threatens the free press — which is protected by the First Amendment,” said BuzzFeed deputy news director Tom Namako.
Other reporters expressed similar concerns on social media.
The administration is justifying the extra scrutiny of reporters who publish classified information on the grounds that national security is at risk.
Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said at the same press conference Friday morning that the torrent of classified leaks flooding out of the executive branch pose a clear threat to national security.

As the Canadian Premier League moves closer to going from dream to reality, with meetings ongoing this week in Toronto, it's a good time to start hearing from the Canadian players whose careers could be impacted by a new national soccer circuit.
The 11 is reaching out to Canadian players, simply asking them for their thoughts about what a CanPL would mean to them.
The hope is that this becomes a bulletin board of sorts; that we hear from players across the country.
If you're a Canadian player and want your voice added to the discussion, reach out to me @stevensandor or teamworkpress@rogers.com.
Thanks go to Rob Notenboom for helping with the inquiries. Here's to hoping that I'll be seeing you at a CanPL game in Regina. Actually, make that many CanPL games in Regina.

“It gives us all a clear rather to becoming a pro. Once a pro, it gives us a sense of belonging — something we otherwise don't really feel. As Canadians we often have to go far distances to play the sport we love to play, away from family and friends and other opportunities.
“Having something at home gives us a chance to contribute to the game in OUR country as opposed to someone else's — also it can give us older players an opportunity to make the transition into coaching or other opportunities within the soccer world.
“Long answer short, the CPL is something we can wholeheartedly get behind and support.”

“We (Canadian players) are waiting in anticipation, a Canadian league will change the landscape of soccer. For Canadian players, it gives us a chance at a future that we've never had before.
“Right now, it's tough for a Canadian to find a job. There really aren't many scouts coming to Canada, so you have to spend a lot of money to go abroad just for a chance at getting a trial somewhere.”
Will Sykes, goalkeeper
Résumé: Europa Point FC (GIB), Lincoln Red Imps (GIB)
“To me, a Canadian league is a requirement. For players like myself, who have had to go abroad to gain some recognition, it would be very important to have a league in Canada that offers chances to Canadian players, teams who aren't like TFC or the Whitecaps, who are very hard to break into unless you were part of their academy systems.
“I want to make a name for myself in this country. Being able to play in Canada would be a dream come true.”
Dylon Powley, goalkeeper
Résumé: Calgary Foothills (PDL), MacEwan University (CIS)
“It's going to be great for Canada, for sure. Right now, there are only five pro teams in Canada, and most of their players aren't Canadian. There is a real lack of opportunities for Canadian players; I am going to Sweden in November for some trials because of the lack of opportunity here in Canada.
“We have seen three teams do really well in the PDL; we got to the final last year, Kitchener-Waterloo won it, Thunder Bay is always near the top. We have the players here. But our players are missing out. We got to the final last year, a team that was 100 per cent Canadian, how does nobody get signed from that team? How do (PDL MVP finalist) Dominic Russo and Ajeej Sarkaria not get signed?
“And, last year, we got to the final, but no one paid attention to us. The MVP? An American? The coach of the year? American. The PDL even made up a creativity award (Creative Player of the Year) that they could give to an American.”
Tofa Fakunle, midfielder/striker
Résumé: Calgary Foothills (PDL), University of Northern British Columbia, 2016-17 Male Athlete of the Year (CIS)
“A new league would offer Canadian players like myself more chances to get to the next level. It would be another platform for us to look to get to.
“The league [PDL] is geared towards Americans. They are always promoting the American players. The last three years, a Canadian team has made it to the finals. But our players don't get signed.
“A new Canadian league would get a lot of interest from Canadian players. People will be surprised at the number of Canadian players who will come looking for trials.”
Aaron Hooper, defender
Résumé: Indiana Fire (NPSL), then tore his ACL at a training camp in Malaga, Spain. Is expecting to be cleared to play again in February, 2018.
“It's a huge opportunity for us. I got into soccer pretty late, I was 12. But what was special for me was that the first team I saw was TFC. And that means a lot to a Canadian player, to have a Canadian team to dream about right from the start.
“I coach as well, and I tell the kids that they could have an opportunity of a lifetime. I tell them they could have the opportunity that I never had at their age, to dream about playing in a Canadian league.
“When my knee heals I am looking to get back to NPSL, USL or PDL. But the goal would be to play in the Canadian Premier League for a long time. It would mean a lot to be able to play in front of family and friends, and then to help build the sport in this country.”
People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny has complained after he was evicted from his constituency office.
The office on New Road, Clondalkin, which the Dublin Mid-West TD has rented since May last year, was secured by a receiver, Duff & Phelps, on Saturday.
The loan holder is Promontoria (Aran) Ltd, the subsidiary of the US fund business Cerberus, which bought a multibillion loan book from Ulster Bank which was in turn linked to 5,400 properties in the Republic and Northern Ireland.
“Whilst the mortgagor may have purported to have granted Deputy Kenny a lease or licence of the property, in light of the receiver's appointment on February 15th, 2016, any such lease or licence is invalid and unenforceable,” the receiver said.
The TD was given notice on July 13th, said the receiver, adding that it had requested the property be vacated before 5pm on July 19th. The receiver took possession of the property, formerly Clare's Pizzeria, on July 22nd.
Out of the country
Mr Kenny, who is out of the country, said he first heard about the problem last Monday and complained that the receiver had not given him enough time to get his affairs in order.
He said his landlord had previously briefly mentioned the existence of a dispute “with the banks”, but he said he did not realise the scale of the problem.
“What's happened here doesn't make sense. Someone is actually in my office at the moment with computers, files that I've had for the last seven or eight years, very personal information and they are in that office at the moment.
“I think it's unbelievable. I got all these phone calls and messages saying the receivers are in your office, they have taken all your signs down. I'm flabbergasted. They should have at least given me a month's notice.”
In the middle
His landlord is seeking legal advice. The receiver's appointment last February was contested and proceedings were issued: “I'm caught in between all of this,” said Mr Kenny. “It's nothing to do with me.”
An order was issued by Mr Justice O'Connor on July 12th, last year, which refused all reliefs sought by the plaintiff, including the request that the receiver be restricted from dealing with the property.
While the decision of Mr Justice O'Connor has been referred to the Court of Appeal by the plaintiff, the receiver said no effort has been made by the borrower to obtain a stay on the order.
Duff & Phelps said it is therefore “entirely incorrect to suggest that the receiver cannot take possession of the property until the appeal has been determined”.
Representatives for Mr Kenny were given access to the premises yesterday so they could remove items, while some items have been left and “they are due to confirm with the receiver when they would like to collect them”, it said.
Cerberus declined to comment on Monday night.
Two years and two days removed from his last NFL game, Cowboys defensive tackle Josh Brent has returned to the field Thursday night.
Brent is active for Thursday night's game in Chicago, NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported according to a source informed of the Cowboys' moves. Brent has been practicing with the Cowboys over the last month since his 10-game suspension ended.
Brent was convicted on an intoxication manslaughter charge for a 2012 drunken car crash that resulted in the death of teammate and friend Jerry Brown. The two men, who played together at the University of Illinois, were close friends.
The Cowboys signed Brent to a contract extension in November that takes him through the 2015 season. The team will look for him to add bulk to a struggling rush defense.
"It's my livelihood, of course I miss it," Brent said to reporters earlier this week.
Cornbread for one and other single serving baked goods seem great in theory - quick, portion-controlled deliciousness.
However, many of the single serving cornbread recipes I found needed to be baked in the oven, which I dislike because of the longer cook time and wasted energy.
I tried making cornbread in the microwave with little success. In general, if a microwaved baked good does not contain sufficient fat, the result can be squishy, dry, and gummy. Microwave baked goods that actually taste good contain absurd quantities of fat, often 2 tablespoons per individual serving, in order to mimic the tenderness of actual baked goods.
To resolve these problems and to satisfy my cornbread craving, I decided to use a pan to make a single serving of soft, buttery cornbread. No oven required!
Cornbread for One

Microwave Cooking Instructions
You can cook this recipe in a small mug in the microwave, but the texture and taste will not be as good.
If you use butter, first add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1/4 cup milk to the mug. Microwave for 30 seconds to melt the butter and heat up the milk. Then, add in the dry ingredients. If you use oil, it does not matter whether you add the wet or dry ingredients first. Gently stir to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Microwave for 1 minute on high to cook.
Step-by-Step Photos
Measure 2 tablespoons of cornmeal and 2 tablespoons of flour.
I get a spoon and a 1/4 cup (4 tablespoon) measuring cup. First, I spoon cornmeal into the measuring cup until about half full. Then, I fill the rest of the measuring cup with flour. You can also use a regular 1 tablespoon measuring spoon.
Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to the dry ingredients. Measure 1/4 cup of milk. I use the 1/4 cup measuring cup from before. Add the milk to the dry ingredients. Do not stir yet.
Measure 1 tablespoon of butter.
Normally, you should melt butter in a small bowl in the microwave. In this case, I melt the butter in the pan I will use to cook the cornbread. Heat the butter over medium heat. Swirl the pan until the butter coats the pan and melts completely. Turn off the heat.
Pour the butter from the pan into the bowl. Wipe off the side of the pan with a paper towel. The pan is already coated with butter and ready for cooking the cornbread.
Gently stir together the wet and dry ingredients.You should get rid of dry streaks, but keep the lumps. If you stir the cornbread batter too much, your cornbread will be dense.
Heat the pan over medium heat. You do not have to wait long for the pan to heat up because the pan should still be hot from melting the butter. Pour in the cornbread batter. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
Flip the cornbread to cook the other side. If you find that the cornbread is getting too brown, turn down the heat from medium to medium low.
Cook for another 1-2 minutes. Serve immediately.
If you want multiple servings of cornbread, you could try scaling the recipe and cooking it in a large pan, but you might have trouble flipping the cornbread over.
If it's cold enough to use an oven, you can make sweet potato cornbread. Feel free to omit the sweet potato and spices for a normal cornbread recipe.
A Rockford man who admitted to masturbating during a Riverside high school swim meet Saturday was taken into police custody after telling officers he received brainwave messages from Justin Bieber telling him to go to the school.
According to a statement from the Riverside Police Dept, 49-year-old Lawrence E. Adamczyk told police his original plan was to go to the Brookfiled Zoo to look for young boys to have sex with. As he was walking by the Riverside Brookfield High School, he said he received “a brainwave message from recording artist Justin Bieber telling them to go to the school.”
Adamczyk was walking the hallways of the school when he was confronted by security staff. Security called police and officers found the man sitting in the bleachers watching the swim meet.
According to the statement, “when officers asked the subject for the names of his children, he paused and then refused to answer. Police then escorted the individual from the bleacher area.”
Adamczyk was taken into custody and then evaluated by Berwyn hospital staff.
While in police custody, Adamczyk stated that he intended on looking for a boy who would have oral sex with him and admitted to masturbating while watching the boys swimming event before police arrived. Adamczyk made several other “intensely sexual statements involving young boys to Riverside Police investigators that are simply too graphic to include in a public statement,” the statement reads.
Riverside Police Chief Thomas Weitzel says in the statement, “His intent was clear. Not only did he intend to enter the high school to locate a young male to victimize but if he was unsuccessful, he was prepared to walk half a block north to the Brookfield Zoo and look for an additional young boy to victimize.”
Weitzel continues “Adamczyk has several prior arrests including an indication on his current parole status that he had prior sex offenses. At the time of his arrest in Riverside, Mr. Adamczyk was on electronic monitoring and had been paroled in December 2012 for an arrest that took place in St. Charles, Illinois in July of 2011. I cannot understand how this individual was not required to register as a sex offender. I ordered my personnel to contact the Illinois Department of Corrections and request his parole status be revoked due to this arrest in Riverside.”
Adamczyk is charged with one count of criminal trespass to land, one count of disorderly conduct and are holding the individual for Monday bond court hearing.
The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) has been forced to back down from its highly publicised battle to try to censor, control and tax streaming content over the internet.
The telecom regulator will once again retreat from the over-the-top regulatory framework it proposed earlier, doing a U-turn on the categorisation of OTT video-on-demand services as a broadcast business.
"Video-on-demand on OTT platforms is not a broadcast business," ACM Thares Punsri, chairman of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), told the Bangkok Post, marking a radical departure from previous resolutions.
The latest move means the NBTC is again backing down from the OTT regulatory framework it proposed in April.
ACM Thares said that considering video-on-demand services as broadcast business obstructs the working process of the new regulatory framework.
OTT regulations are one of the top items on the agenda of a board meeting to be held today, he said.
The U-turn is to ease the way for a new regulatory framework for OTT.
"OTT is a digital application or service that is operated on an internet network, similar to the add-on digital application, and it's unjustified to be included in broadcast business," ACM Thares said, adding that it would also be improper to have OTT operators focus solely on video-on-demand services.
He said the board meeting will hear an update on the progress of the new OTT regulatory framework.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha last month told the NBTC to work on the OTT regulation framework based on consideration of impacts and benefits to the business and the country. Any resolutions should concern innovative services and fair competition, Gen Prayut said.
The rise of OTT, and online video and TV in particular, has created challenges for regulators over how to set policy governing content and operations.
A source in the industry said global OTT platform providers have pressured the government for months through their local affiliates and the US-Asean Business Council.
The 30-year-old council represents more than 140 US corporations, including Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon.
Federal agents raided an unknown number of marijuana dispensaries and growing sites on Thursday in Colorado, confiscating piles of marijuana plants and cartons of cannabis-infused drinks just weeks before the state allows sellers of recreational marijuana to open their doors.
The action appeared to send a message that federal authorities would be keeping a close watch on the industry as a state law legalizing pot is implemented.
The raids, conducted on a frigid, snowy morning, were the first in Colorado since the U.S. Department of Justice said in August that it wouldn't interfere with state marijuana laws as long as the drug is kept away from children, the black market and other states, among other guidelines.
In a statement, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver said the criminal investigations unit of the Internal Revenue Service, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and Denver authorities were involved in executing the sealed search and seizure warrants.
The raided businesses were suspected of violating more than one of the eight guidelines issued by the Justice Department.
"Although we cannot at this time discuss the substance of this pending investigation, the operation under way today comports with the department's recent guidance regarding marijuana enforcement matters," spokesman Jeff Dorschner said in a statement.
Deirdre Stepter, an IRS spokeswoman, declined to elaborate.
Daria Serna, a spokeswoman for Colorado's revenue department, which regulates the industry, said the agency was aware of the raids and would "continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigation."
Retail marijuana sales are set to begin on Jan. 1 in Colorado, though not all municipalities will be ready to regulate sales by then. For now, dispensaries are supposed to sell only to people with medical permission to use the drug. Many of the state's 500 or so existing dispensaries are making plans to convert to recreational sales.
At one of the raided dispensaries, VIP Cannabis in Denver, agents loaded boxes into a rental truck. One officer wore a surgical mask. Several operators, including some at VIP Cannabis, didn't return calls seeking comment.
In Boulder, agents raided a number of marijuana-growing warehouses, leaving a chest-high pile of pot plants on the side of a road before loading them into trucks, The Daily Camera reported.
People involved in Colorado's marijuana industry were quick to point out that the raids did not necessarily mean the federal government was going back on its word or planning to interfere with Colorado's recreational pot market.
Mike Elliott, a spokesman for the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, said the industry itself has pushed for robust regulations and expects compliance with lengthy state regulations on how the drug and be grown and sold.
"While everyone involved in these raids should be considered innocent until proven guilty, enforcement is a sign that this program is working and maturing," he said in a statement.
Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project said it wasn't clear how many businesses were raided. Many dispensaries and growing warehouses were operating as usual Thursday.
He said in a statement that he hopes federal authorities were "sticking to their word and not interfering with any state-regulated, law-abiding businesses."
US president due to sign off executive orders, including a temporary ban on refugees from the Middle East
Donald Trump is due to sign off a volley of executive orders on national security, including measures to start the construction of a wall on the Mexican border and the imposition of a ban on refugees from the Middle East.
The new US president is expected to sign orders setting out federal funding for the wall during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, two administration officials told the Associated Press.
He will also impose a temporary ban on most refugees and suspend visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries, congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the measures told Reuters.
According to a report in the New York Times, Trump is also considering measures that are even more contentious, including reviewing whether to resume the once-secret “black site” detention programme, designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation, and keeping open the Guantánamo Bay detention centre.
Trump appeared to preview the measures in a characteristic tweet late on Tuesday that said: “Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!”
Trump and Syrian refugees in the US: separating the facts from fiction Read more
Trump has used executive orders as a very public show of swiftly undoing the work of the Obama administration and beginning to honour pledges made on the campaign trail. On Tuesday, he angered Native Americans and climate change activists by signing executive orders to allow construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. On Monday, he reinstated the “global gag rule”, which bans funding for groups that offer abortions or abortion advocacy, even if they use their own funds to do so.
His latest orders are expected to involve restricting access to the US for refugees and some visa holders from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, said the aides and experts. By doing so, he looks likely to ignore Bana al-Abed, the seven-year-old girl whose tweets from Aleppo drew attention to the city's devastation, who has urged Trump to “do something for the children of Syria” in an open letter.
James Carafano, who led the Trump's homeland security transition team, insisted that the planned visa restrictions were “prudent”.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: “We have seen legitimate cases of transnational terrorism of people travelling from one country to another to do terrorist acts. We have actually seen a number of them in western Europe, so a country putting in place prudent measures to interdict terrorist travel by making sure you are screening refugees and visa applicants appropriately is not in any way imprudent. And dealing with that while you're also dealing with trying to prevent homegrown terrorist attacks at the same time to me just sounds like reasonable responsible national security.
“It doesn't seem like an effort to persecute any religion or any particular people.”
Carafano conceded that the wall on the Mexico border would initially have to be paid for by the US government. “If the federal government buys a tank the only way it can do that is with federal dollar,” he said.
America's oldest Muslim families on the Trump presidency: 'This can't deter us' Read more
The restrictions on refugees are likely to include bans for several months on admissions from all countries until the state and homeland security departments can make the vetting process more rigorous. The US already has one of the most rigorous vetting processes in the world, and it can take up to two years of interviews and background checks for a person to gain admittance.
There is also likely to be an exception for those fleeing religious persecution if their religion is a minority in their country, a person briefed on the proposal told Reuters. That exception could cover Christians fleeing Muslim-majority nations.
Trump initially proposed a “complete and total” ban on Muslims entering the US, but has since said he would instead focus on restrictions on countries whose migrants could pose a threat.
Detractors could launch legal challenges to the moves if all the countries subject to the ban are Muslim-majority nations, said Hiroshi Motomura, of the UCLA School of Law. Legal arguments could claim the executive orders discriminate against a particular religion, which would be unconstitutional, he said.
“His comments during the campaign and a number of people on his team focused very much on religion as the target,” Motomura said.
Trump and a Muslim registry: does he want one – and is it even possible? Read more
To block entry from the designated countries, Trump is likely to instruct the state department to stop issuing visas to people from those nations, according to sources familiar with the visa process. He could also instruct Customs and Border Protection to stop any current visa holders from those countries from entering the US. During the campaign, Trump also floated the idea of a religious registry, a plan that would be likely to face challenges in the courts.
The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said on Tuesday that the state and homeland security departments would work on the vetting process once Trump's nominee to head the state department, Rex Tillerson, is confirmed.
Other measures may include directing all agencies to finish work on a biometric identification system for non-citizens entering and exiting the US and a crackdown on immigrants fraudulently receiving government benefits, according to the congressional aides and immigration experts.

NEW YORK -- Alex Rodriguez will likely have to wait until 2014 to learn the outcome of the grievance hearing into his 211-game suspension by Major League Baseball, but the New York Yankees slugger passed his own verdict on the performance of his legal team Thursday night.
"We crushed it,'' Rodriguez said. "They had nothing.''
But his elation with his lawyers was tempered somewhat by the realization that his fate now lies in the hands of arbitrator Fredric Horowitz.
"Now that it's over, as far as the state of the case, how the evidence went in, how my team challenged it, I feel great,'' Rodriguez said. "The only thing that concerns me is the process.''
Rodriguez spoke with ESPNNewYork.com for about 45 minutes in a conference room at the Manhattan offices of his attorneys about three hours after baseball finished up its last order of business in the hearing, calling three rebuttal witnesses in the afternoon after Rodriguez's lawyers had rested their case in the morning.
Both sides have until Dec. 11 to file written briefs -- the labor hearing equivalent of closing arguments -- and another 10 days after that to file replies to each other's briefs. Once that process is completed, Horowitz has 25 days to render his decision, almost certainly pushing a resolution of the case into January of next year.
Already, Rodriguez's legal team, led by Joseph Tacopina, is planning its next move -- obtaining an injunction to prevent a suspension from being implemented. Yet despite Rodriguez's optimism, his lawyers seem resigned to the reality that Horowitz will mete out some form of punishment.
"I firmly believe Alex should get a goose egg here, but Horowitz has to be prepared for this to be his last arbitration to do that,'' said Jordan Siev, one of Rodriguez's attorneys. "But do I think he would have the courage to give him a goose egg? I'd like to think so, but I frankly can't imagine Alex walks out of there with nothing.''
Comcast will roll out its 1TB internet data usage limits to a large part of the U.S., including Washington, Oregon and California Nov. 1.
Comcast said the 1TB cap means 99 percent of users won't hit their limit. The “typical” customer, Comcast has said, uses just 75GB per month, but tests of the data limits led to more than 13,000 FCC complaints as of last December.
The usage limits are not a hard cap, so those who go over the threshold will not see their service interrupted. For those who do exceed the 1TB limit, Comcast will charge $10 for extra 50GB data blocks, with a cap on monthly overage charges at $200.
High usage customers can purchase an unlimited data option for $50 a month on top of their existing bill. Comcast will offer two “courtesy months,” where users won't be charged overages if they use more than 1TB of data. Customers can check their usage to see if it is a good idea to spring for the unlimited package. Limits do not apply to several types of Comcast plans, such as business customers and the Gigabit Pro tier of service.
Comcast has been testing broadband data limits for years. Last year, Comcast boosted the limit from 300GB per month in test markets to 1TB. When the rollout is complete, Comcast will have data limits in all or part of 27 states.
On an FAQ page about the data usage limit, Comcast says 1TB — or 1024GB — has capacity for 600 to 700 hours of HD video, or 12,000 hours of online gaming, or more than 15,000 hours of music streaming or the ability to upload and download 60,000 high resolution photos.
Previously, Comcast had used congestion as a reason to try out data limits. But the company changed its tactics last year and began focusing on the concept of fairness.
“Our data plans are based on a principle of fairness,” Comcast said in its FAQ. “Those who use more Internet data, pay more. And those who use less Internet data, pay less.”
Did you miss the 23rd Avenue Corridor Improvements Project open house last week? No worries! You can still view the open house materials and share your feedback with us through our online open house until Tuesday, October 17. Visit the site to learn more about upcoming Phase 2 construction from S Jackson Street to Rainier Avenue S, expected to begin as soon as April 2018.
We're listening and we want to hear from you. We understand the importance of coordinating with other agencies and their projects adjacent to 23rd Avenue S and in the surrounding area. To learn more about these projects including the Sound Transit Judkins Park Station, Community House, and Vulcan explore the Coordination page of our online open house.
At the open house, we shared how we've incorporated community feedback into the final project design and information about priority hire. Priority hire will require the Phase 2 construction contractor to complete a percentage of project hours with apprentice and journey level workers from economically distressed zip codes. The program also includes goals for the construction contractor to employ women and people of color for a percentage of project hours.
Our goal is to enhance safety and mobility for people who walk, drive, and take transit, as well as completing important infrastructure improvements. North of S Holgate Street, 23rd Avenue S will be modified from two lanes in each direction to one wider lane in each direction, with a center turn lane. This configuration is in current use on 23rd Avenue from S Jackson Street to E Madison Street, part of Phase 1 construction.
We'll share more specifics about the construction schedule and expected impacts in early 2018 at an open house, after a contractor has been selected. For more information or to request a project briefing, please email 23rdAveCorridor@seattle.gov or call 206-727-8857.
A report from Sweclockers suggests that AMD can be upto something big for their upcoming FX CPU refresh. According to the report, AMD is possibly preparing an FX-9000 and FX-8770 processors.
AMD FX-9000 High-Performance FX CPU in the Works?
Both processors would be based on the x86 Piledriver architecture which may not spark interest among the PC crowd but its not the architecture that's astonishing about the new processors, its their clock speeds. AMD's FX-9000 which is a FX CPU refresh is aiming to push the clock speeds at 4.8 GHz base and 5.0 GHz Turbo core clock which is a record native frequency for any processor ever released. The FX-9000 still has 8 Piledriver modules and 8 MB of L3 cache, its compatible with the AM3+ socket and will support 1866 MHz+ memory. Another change is the TDP, the FX-9000 is probably gonna get a trophy for its massive 220W TDP which compared to the SB-E Intel processors is quiet high and would require some massive cooling solutions just to let the heat off.
While writing about the FX-9000 chip, the first thing that came to my mind was the FX-Centurion. A rumored processor which was also supposed to feature a 5 GHz clock frequency and design exactly the same as the FX-9000. Hexus who leaked this story also revealed that the chip would cost $795 making it the GeForce Titan of CPUs. The FX-9000 chip could be the Centurion, it seems so since the older rumor matches this story but i would not place bets on it.
AMD FX-9000 AMD FX-8770 AMD FX-8350 Architecture Piledriver Piledriver Piledriver Family Vishera Vishera Vishera Manufacture 32 nm SOI HKMG 32 nm SOI HKMG 32 nm SOI HKMG Cores 8 pcs. (4 pcs. Modules) 8 pcs. (4 pcs. Modules) 8 pcs. (4 pcs. Modules) CPU Clock Base 4.8 GHz Unknown 4.0 GHz CPU Turbo Core 5.0 GHz Unknown 4.2 GHz L2 cache 4 x 2 MB 4 x 2 MB 4 x 2 MB L3 cache 8 MB 8 MB 8 MB Max. DDR3 1866 MHz 1866 MHz 1866 MHz TDP 220 W 220 W 125 W Base AM3 + AM3 + AM3 +
The second processor that got leaked is the FX-8770, again a similar designed chip which would replace the FX-8350 and would have 8 Cores and a TDP of 220W. Its clock frequencies are not known but i suppose near 5 GHz for this chip is pretty much expected. No pricing or release date was mentioned but the only thing we have near to a possible release date could be a teaser released by AMD themselves on their Facebook page, according to that, more details are expected to arrive at Computex 2013 which goes live from 4th June. So if you're into high wattage TDPs, then the upcoming FX CPUs sure are built for you.
The Trudeau government is one step closer to granting citizenship to a convicted terrorist.
Earlier this week, Liberals in the Senate voted to support the Trudeau government's controversial Bill C-6.
The bill substantially waters down the value of Canadian citizenship.
It eliminates the language requirements for newcomers over the age of 54 and reduces the amount of time immigrants must spend in Canada to become eligible for citizenship – down to just three years of part-time residency.
The most controversial aspect of Bill C-6, though, is a provision to protect the citizenship of convicted terrorists.
Conservative Senator Daniel Lang proposed an amendment to Bill C-6 – to uphold an existing law that allows judges the ability to strip citizenship from dual nationals convicted of terrorism.
Canada already allows for citizenship revocation for a number of reasons, including cases of fraud or when a war crime has been committed. The previous Conservative government expanded this law, adding terrorism and treason to the list of crimes that can lead to the stripping of Canadian citizenship.
On the 2015 campaign trail, Trudeau defended the overall practice of citizenship revocation.
He said he believed that “revocation of citizenship can and should happen in situations of becoming a Canadian citizen on false pretences.”
Trudeau also insisted, however, that “terrorists should get to keep their Canadian citizenship.”
The rationale for Trudeau's platitude that a “Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian”—even if that “Canadian” is a foreign-born agent convicted of terrorism—was never clear.
His half-baked logic asserted that stripping citizenship from foreign-born terrorists amounted to “two-tiered citizenship,” and yet, somehow revocation for lying or covering up war crimes was justifiable.
Senator Lang's amendment would have allowed revocation to apply in cases of terrorism, too.
But Trudeau's Senators voted to reject Lang's amendment. And now one convicted terrorist who had his citizenship stripped will soon be granted a second chance at being Canadian.
Zakaria Amara was slapped with a life sentence back in 2006 for his role in a plot to murder scores of Canadians.
Amara led an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell known as the Toronto 18. He groomed fellow jihadists and devised a plot to wage a major terrorist attack in Toronto and Ottawa.
He planned to detonate bombs and launch coordinated shooting sprees at the Toronto Stock Exchange and the CBC in downtown Toronto, as well as a siege on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.
As a grand finale, Amara wanted to behead then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
Amara was born in Jordan, and raised in Saudi Arabia. His parents brought him to Canada as a teenager, and he became a Canadian citizen as a young man. And yet, by the age of 20, Amara was in prison for terrorism.
This man never had an allegiance to Canada. He may have sworn the oath of citizenship, but he remained loyal to the murderous ideology of Islamist terrorism.
He betrayed the country that took him in, and immediately rejected Canadian ideals and values.
Amara was ungrateful to Canada that he sought to indiscriminately murder Canadians and shatter our sense of safety and security.
Thankfully, his plot was foiled and he was convicted of numerous terrorist charges. Under the Harper government, his citizenship was revoked.
But thanks to Trudeau and his loyalists in the Senate who pushed through Bill C-6, there is little left standing between Amara and the privilege of Canadian citizenship.
In Trudeau's Canada, citizenship ain't what it used to be.
Redbirds Upend FBS Eastern Michigan, 31-14
YPSILANTI, Mich. - A stifling Illinois State (2-0) defense overwhelmed Eastern Michigan (1-1, 0-1 MAC), helping erase a four-point halftime deficit, as the No. 18 Redbirds rallied for a 31-14 victory in Ypsilanti, Mich., Saturday afternoon. The victory marked Illinois State's first victory against a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) team since, Sept. 14, 1991, against Akron.
With Saturday's win, Illinois State improved to 2-0 for the first time since 1999 and have now won five-consecutive games versus Eastern Michigan.
The stingy Redbird defense forced five turnovers and did not allow any second half points, as ISU played penalty-free football en route to the victory. A pair of second-half scoring runs from Darrelynn Dunn , coupled with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Brown to Donovan Harden , paced the Redbirds to a 21 un-answered second half points.
Offensively, Dunn amassed his second-consecutive 100-plus yard effort, finishing the day with 130 yards on 32 carries and two touchdowns. Brown went 14-for-22 for 155 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Tyrone Walker and Lechein Neblett each finished with four receptions to pace the receivers. Senior Ben Ericksen intercepted two passes and tipped one more to Mike Zimmer , while Shelby Harris totaled eight tackles and Nate Palmer registered 1.5 sacks.
Illinois State scored first on its second drive of the game, after a special teams penalty against the Eagles on an attempted Redbirds punt swung momentum to ISU. Three players later, Jonathon Miller broke a 58-yard touchdown run down the right hash marks for his first career touchdown as a Redbird. He would finish the game with 84 yards on nine attempts.
Later in the quarter, Illinois State forced its first of five turnovers on the day, as Ezra Thompson recovered Demarius Reed's bobbled catch on a punt return, giving the Redbirds the ball on the EMU 41. A 24-yard pass from Brown to Walker set up Nick Aussieker 's 26-yard field goal, putting ISU in front, 10-0, with 1:19 to go in the first quarter.
After an Evan Frierson sack gave Illinois State possession once again, head coach Brock Spack went for it on fourth and one at the Eastern Michigan 14-yard line, but Miller was dropped for a two yard loss. The Eagles would then cover 84 yards on six plays, as quarterback Alex Gillett completed two long passes, including a 32-yard touchdown score to Garrett Hoskins to cut the lead to 10-7.
The Eagles added one more score following a Cameron Hunt fumble at the Redbirds' 24-yard line. Four different Eagles touched the ball, as the rush-only scoring drive ended on a five-yard quarterback keeper from Gillett with 4:20 to go in the first half. It would cap the scoring in the first half and mark the final time during the game that EMU found the end zone.
Trailing 14-10 at the break, the Illinois State defense forced three consecutive three and outs to open the second half, and two long scoring drives gave the Redbirds the lead for good. Brown led a six-play, 67-yard touchdown drive with long completions to Neblett and Walker, before finding Harden in the right corner of the end zone for a 22-yard score to put the Redbirds ahead, 17-14. On their next drive, ISU used seven plays and traveled 52 yards, before Dunn leapt into the end zone for a four-yard scoring play, making it 24-14 in favor of ISU with 3:24 to go in the third quarter.
Eastern Michigan's best second-half scoring opportunity came after lineman Colin Weingrad intercepted Brown on an attempted screen pass deep in Illinois State territory. Unable to register a first down, Eastern Michigan's 37-yard field goal attempt was diverted at the line of scrimmage. Illinois State then ate over nine minutes off the play clock, before Brown was sacked on fourth-and-five to give the ball back to EMU. Gillett's first play from scrimmage was tipped by Ericksen into Zimmer's arms for the interception, swinging the momentum once again.
The Redbirds would then orchestrate a 10-play, 30-yard scoring drive that covered 4:31. On his eighth carry of the drive, Dunn rushed four yards into the end zone for the final touchdown of the game. Gillett would throw one more interception to Ericksen, before Brown ran out the clock to secure the 31-14 victory.
The Redbirds return to Hancock Stadium Saturday, Sept. 15, for the Mid-America Classic versus in-state rival Eastern Illinois. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m.

WALTHAM — When a new French restaurant opens in the place a longstanding French restaurant closed, or a vegan cafe where another vegan cafe failed, or a gastropub where a previous gastropub was hoisted by its own poutine, it makes you wonder. Amuleto Mexican Table didn't just take over the former home of Habanero's Mexican Kitchen. Before that the space was taqueria Tango Mango.
Third time is charming. Partners Adrian Ortiz and Karen Bressler have opened a modern little Mexican restaurant, not bogged down by Mexican-restaurant cliche. (He works in telecommunications; she was CEO of foodservice distributor AGAR Supply Co. and chairs the board of Community Servings, among other things.) The space is filled with rococo patterned velvet banquettes (“we are in the elegantly upholstered Disney-teacup-ride round table right by the entrance,” reads a message from a friend who arrives first). The soundtrack is free of mariachi riffs. The bar is all earth tones and natural wood, geometric patterns and dangling black metal light fixtures. The cocktail list highlights mezcal in a fashion that would do any bar in town proud, with nine varieties to sip, as well as drinks based around this smoky specialty of Oaxaca.
Aram Boghosian for The Boston Globe Salmon al pastor with pineapple and tomatillo sauce, served with kale and rice.
That is Ortiz's home state. Chef Carlos Durazo, previously at now-closed Mexican restaurant Rio Bravo in Danvers, is from Sonora, and general manager Rogerio Padilla from Baja. Regions matter in Mexican, as in all, cuisine — the idea of “Mexican food” is comparable to that of “American,” “Chinese,” or “Indian” food in its elision of culture and character. Amuleto's menu explores happily these differences, embracing mole, carne asada, fish tacos, Mexico City-style quesadillas. Some of the restaurant's main dishes would be at home in any upscale bistro — grilled salmon al pastor, for example, or pork tenderloin with tamarind sauce. But the food works within tradition rather than exploding it. It is current, clean, and bright.

Almost every table seems to order the fresh, chunky guacamole. It is a measure of the avocado dip's quality that Amuleto's tortilla chips are not great — often only half-fried, soggy in parts — and no one minds too much. (The house salsas — tomatillo, habanero, and roasted tomato — work better dolloped on food than as solo dips.) The best part of starting a meal at Amuleto might be the complimentary dish of vegetable escabeche — pickled carrots, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and more, bracing and refreshing.

Ceviche de coliflor has a similar flavor profile, the cauliflower folded together with fresh salsa and citrus. It's a satisfying vegetarian alternative to the ceviche of the day, prepared with fish. Those who don't eat meat will not feel cheated at Amuleto (unless, as we do one evening, they receive the guacamole made with pork belly rather than the meat-free version), where we have tart, cranberry-hued hibiscus tacos, roasted vegetable enchiladas, and chiles rellenos with quinoa. The menu also, unobtrusively, happens to be gluten-free.
There are two octopus dishes on the menu, both standouts. In pulpo asado, it appears grilled, with mushrooms, caramelized onions, and chiles, the tendrils' exterior charred, their interior tender and delicate. Even better is a tostada topped with slices of octopus bound together with serrano-cilantro pesto, cucumber, and avocado aioli — some heat, some crunch, some richness to set off the mild meat.
Tortillas are made fresh each day, leaving the sweet, toasty scent of corn to linger on the fingertips after the tacos are gone. There is only one delicate wrapper per taco, rather than the double some places use. I miss the second not for structural issues — these are strong enough — but because I want more tortilla in each bite. The roast pork in the tacos al pastor is a bit dry, but it tastes good as a package, with pineapple and tomatillo salsa. Barbacoa tacos are excellent, piled with braised short rib, as flavorful as it is tender, and set to a slow burn with chile de arbol salsa.
DF-style quesadillas are masa turnovers, more like empanadas than the quesadillas we know. Two to a serving, one is filled with cheese and poblano pepper, the other with chicken tinga, the dough crisp on the outside and lightly, perfectly greasy. Enchiladas can be filled with chicken, shrimp, or vegetables, draped in green or red sauce or glossy, dark brown mole poblano. All of Amuleto's sauces are made in house, and this complex specialty of Puebla is no exception, a blend of dozens of ingredients including cocoa, nuts, and spices. The flavor is deep and complicated, but the mole itself the night we try it is overly sweet. The green sauce, on the other hand, is too acidic. And the chicken in the enchiladas is dry.

Balance can be elusive. Pork tenderloin with tamarind sauce, crisp bits of pork belly, cotija cheese, and roast potatoes is a dish that works well when one can get a bite of every ingredient on the fork. Alone, there's not enough oomph; more tamarind sauce would help. A beautifully grilled piece of salmon is served al pastor, with pineapple and tomatillo sauce, alongside kale and rice. The pineapple isn't sweet enough to meet the tart tomatillos halfway, and there's not enough of either element on the fish.
Aram Boghosian for The Boston Globe Mole enchiladas with chicken.
Camarones a la diabla cloaks shrimp in a creamy, warming chipotle sauce; it is the Mexican equivalent of chicken tikka masala. Charred green beans enhance the smokiness of the sauce, and the rice is bright with lime. Here we have balance.
Birria de chamorro is a braised lamb shank, sliced green chiles, red onion, and cilantro vivid against a backdrop of savory jus. It is described as being wrapped in a banana leaf, but that is removed before it arrives at the table. Also not in evidence, hominy puree, a disappointment, although a few whole kernels float in the broth. Carne asada is a spot-on version — the grilled steak rare on the inside, accompanied by a cheese enchilada cloaked in guajillo chile sauce, refried beans, and guacamole.
Amuleto's flan is a denser version than I've had elsewhere, nearly cream cheese-like in texture and not at all eggy. I prefer the rice pudding brulee and a parfait of chocolate pudding studded with bites of chocolate. The best dessert here is the heady cafe a la Karlos, spiked with mezcal and coffee liqueur. Karlos, a bartender, comes by with a wave and a nod. Amuleto's servers are warm and attentive, and gifted at sensing when someone is in need of another drink.
The surprise winner among the many margarita variations, ordered on a lark, is the frozen one. Made with tamarind, mango, and strawberry, it is a riff on the chamoyada, a sort of Mexican Slurpee. It is a little sweet and a little spicy, a little sour. Bartenders are happy to share their mezcal knowledge, and drinks like the Oaxaca Old Fashioned (mezcal, agave nectar, and bitters) and the jamaica mezcalini (hibiscus, mezcal, clove, cardamom, and ginger) showcase it well. There is also a selection of Mexican beer, micheladas in mugs the size of your head, and sangria. “Ask your server for wine selection.”

In another city, Amuleto would feel less remarkable. We still have just a handful of good Mexican restaurants here, and we continue to wait for the place that successfully combines fine dining and the country's rich culinary tradition. Amuleto's name means “amulet” or “talisman,” and a little cosmic good fortune never hurts. But with warm hospitality and good taste, Amuleto is making its own luck.

Four years of detours and driving delays on the northeast leg of Anthony Henday are about to come to an end.
A wet summer has slowed work on the $1.8-billion project, but officials say those problems will not delay the planned Oct. 1 opening date.
Transportation Minister Brian Mason says the project is on schedule and he's one of many relieved it is.
“I've struggled with the construction for a long time and I'm just really looking forward to getting this project completed.”

Several detours remain in effect along the Henday from Yellowhead Drive to the Whitemud.
Crews are still working on Meridian Street. There's paving work happening throughout the project. However, much of the work is either done or almost done.
The bridges crossing the North Saskatchewan River are paved and even have lines painted on them. The Baseline Road interchange should open to traffic within two weeks.
Many of the project's 47 bridges are either complete or just need their on or off ramps completed.

Mason says the wait will be worth it.
“That will complete the ring road around Edmonton. I think it's going to be very beneficial to the city, to the economy and to the region as a whole.”
For those forced to navigate through the construction, Oct. 1 can't come soon enough.
John Salome and Nick Schrobilgen are movers from Thunder Bay. On Tuesday, they arrived in Edmonton with a load destined for west Edmonton.
“I was supposed to be the navigator,” Schrobilgen said. “I had the GPS going on the phone. That wasn't too much of a help.”
The pair was sidetracked by the detours as they entered the city.
“We were trying to follow the detours,” Salome said. “But we were off track about four times. It took a while. We had to tell our customer we were going to be about 30 minutes late.”
It turned out, they were about 45 minutes late.
Salome does not want to go through that again.
“I'm hoping I'm not back here before then because it's kind of a pain but after Oct. 1, I have no problem coming to Edmonton.”
The construction project finishes off the last 27 kilometres of the Anthony Henday. The new section accounts for nearly half of the more than $4 billion dollars spent to build the ring road.

Louis van Gaal knew it and Daley Blind did, too. As the duo walked towards the tunnel at the interval of Manchester United's FA Cup quarter-final with Arsenal, it was apparent something had to change to alleviate the freedom their visitors had enjoyed in midfield.
Fatally, Van Gaal remained loyal to the blowing Blind and hooked Ander Herrera. Arsenal regained their lead, United were devoid of impetus in midfield and lost.
Blind, who has started every game he has been available for this season, was culpable for Arsenal's dominance and his manager, whose infamous Dutchification of Barcelona outraged Catalans in the late 90s, was accused of, well, blind loyalty.
Like others before him this season, though, Blind was reprieved by an injury and the Dutchman's Clockwork Orange timing was perfect.
Blind's switch to left-back has sparked perhaps his best run of form. During a testing sequence of fixtures, he has shone as one of United's most consistent performers and his versatility has proved to be valuable.
Timing, as he showcased in Brazil last summer, is not underestimated by Blind. Without his perceptive technique, the Netherlands would almost certainly not have annihilated Spain 5-1 in Salvador. Robin van Persie's Superman impression levelled the game, however it was Blind's incisive pass that bypassed Spain's midfield and defence to leave Iker Casillas powerless.
Blind has spent the majority of the season in midfield with United. One Dutch journalist, shortly after it was announced United had agreed a deal with Ajax, opined Blind was 'phlegmatic' and in danger of being over-hyped due to his assist for Van Persie.
At times, Blind's passing and plodding have caused problems. Before the Arsenal tie, he resembled a Robin Reliant attempting to catch a Ferrari as Moussa Sissoko powered past him at Newcastle and he looked like he had stepped off a rollercoaster following 45 minutes against Arsene Wenger's fleet-footed midfield.
Only Van Gaal knows whether Blind would have continued in midfield had the brittle Luke Shaw not succumbed to another injury. The returning Michael Carrick would have intensified the competition too but, with Marcos Rojo also sidelined, the Dutchman started at left-back against Tottenham.
At the start of the season, United supporters would have expected their left-wing combination to be Shaw and Angel di Maria, but it is Blind and Ashley Young who have truly prospered as a partnership.
Tottenham's right-hand side was swamped by the swashbuckling pair, as Kyle Walker was left looking like schoolboy victimised by bullies and Andros Townsend was hauled off before the interval.
Blind was excellent at Anfield, where he caused Emre Can to tumble like Paul Alcock and there was little surprise that United's breakthrough at Villa came via the left flank.
Accustomed to a left wing role in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 with Hollland, Blind has quickly developed into an attack-minded and dependable Premier League left-back.
The benchmark for that role at United is Denis Irwin and Blind is a graceful full-back who has dashed concerns over his pace by dominating speedy threats like Townsend, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Agbonlahor.
Irwin was seldom intimidated and used to starting on the front-foot, whoever the opponent was, and Blind has shown similar confidence.
Shaw, signed before Van Gaal officially took over, should be nervous. David Moyes did plenty of the legwork on his deal and Blind enjoys a close bond with Van Gaal for numerous reasons. He is in the team on merit, though, and it is difficult to remember Shaw producing as impressive a sequence of displays as Blind has lately.
Blind is five years Shaw's senior and at times it is patent.
At Swansea in February, he rollocked Shaw for repeating the mistake that led to Ki Sung-Yong's equaliser when the South Korean almost repeated the trick.
Fluent in English, Blind is emerging as one of Wayne Rooney's lieutenants. Judging by his loyalty, Van Gaal knows it, too.

Lover Knots
This spell is designed to be made by a pair who are already lovers. It's designed as an activity to bring you together and to remind you of each other when things get rough.
Think of it as a magic reservoir of each other's love for when you can't be together or are having a spat.
Each of you will make a bracelet for the other and place intentions into the bracelet you make. Your intention could be to protect them (love is excellent for protection), to tie the two of you together or to help solve a particular problem between the two of you. The important thing about this is that both parties participate and have discussed what they want out of the spell.
Here are a few knot bracelet tutorials as ideas.
Friendship Bracelet
Another Friendship Bracelet
Beads and Braids Work Too
Pick one and get knotting! With each knot that you make think and meditate about your intention but this doesn't need to be a somber thing. Laugh and chat with your lover and really get the love flowing between the two of you (breaks for kissing and stuff are a good idea if you want). Use this as a chance to really get close with your partner. The emotion and energy that you have during this is going to stick so no being mad at each other or arguing or nit picking or talking about the dishes or anything. Take this time to just be in love.
If you want, when you've finished making the bracelet you can let it charge in sunlight or moonlight or say an incantation or prayer to a deity over it, whatever works with your practice. Now swap and wear your new lovers knots.
If, for any reason, you wish to undo the spell, each knot in the bracelet must be broken. This can be done by going through and untying each one, by cutting each one or by burning the entire bracelet (if it's flammable). A single knot left unbroken will still retain its power.
Despite being named “Lovers Knots”, this spell can be used by any pair of people or even a group! Friends, siblings and parents with their children can all modify this spell for their use.
In a group you can have a rotation of sorts, each person begins a bracelet, makes maybe an inch and then passes it in one direction around the circle where the next person will make another inch and continue passing it. Each bracelet will have been made in part by every member of the group. Activities of this sort are excellent for covens!
Lucky Knot Spell
Another good example for the uses of knots in magic, this spell works a little differently than the last. Each knot is designed to be a pre-made “quick release” spell. You should choose a cord material that is easy for you to untie.
Prep for this spell however you like, cast a circle, consecrate your cord, call your deities, whatever. Now, pick a number for your spell, my first choice would be my lucky number but use whatever number associations you'd like.
Begin by creating your first knot. This knot is your anchor, it sets the framework for the entire spell, imbue it with the intention that each subsequent knot will be a holder. The idea is to have a spell attached to each knot and as the knot is untied, the spell is released and activated. Once you finish with your first knot you can start on the rest of them, with each that you make charge the knot with your intention, in this case, luck. You can do this in a number of ways, meditating, chanting, incantations and prayers all work. The incantation below is just an example of something I've used before.
Ex. Winds of fortune blow, let my good luck grow.
Finish up in your preferred way, close your circle, ground, thank any spirits that you work with, etc. You can now keep the cord with you and whenever you need a little burst of luck (before a test or interview, talking to your crush, competing, anything like that) just untie a knot.
Here is what you need to know on this Thursday, August 18, one day before the Washington Redskins play the New York Jets at FedEx Field.
Timeline
—Today's schedule: Walkthrough at Redskins Park, no media availability.
—The Redskins last played a game that counted 221 days ago. It will be 25 days until they host the Steelers in their 2016 season opener.
—Days until: Final roster cut 16; Cowboys @ Redskins 31; Browns @ Redskins 45
—Former Redskins returner (and my current CSN colleague) Brian Mitchell was born on this date in 1968.
The Redskins by the numbers
The Josh Doctson Achilles injury situation drags on. Jay Gruden said yesterday that there is no timetable for him taking the practice field. With about three and a half weeks to go until the Redskins take on the Steelers in their season opener, there can't be too many more delays until they push into the regular season.
There is beginning to be talk of the possibility of having Doctson start the season on the physically unable to perform list. That is a move that has some advantages but carries some significant downside as well.
Doctson is eligible to go on in-season PUP because he was put on the PUP list at the start of training camp. If he comes off of the list for one day, he can't go back on it.
If he stays on the PUP list until September 3, the day the roster has to be cut to 53 players, the team will have the option to put him on in-season PUP. If that happens, Doctson will not count against the roster limit. Assuming he still can't play by the, that might be the right move to make. Instead of tying up a roster spot on a player who will have to be inactive for each game the Redskins could get help in another area.
But a player on PUP is not only prohibited from playing for six weeks, he can't even practice for six weeks. That means that if Doctson is ready to go physically after, say, two weeks he can't even step out on the practice field with his teammates for another four weeks. That would seriously hamper his development for both the short and long term.
Should he remain close to ready to practice when cutdown date rolls around the best move might be to keep him on the 53-man roster. Every week one receiver usually is inactive so why not let Doctson get back to practice when he is ready not when league PUP list rules say he can.
The problem with leaving him on the 53 is that there would be a major issue if he either doesn't get better at a fast enough pace or if he suffers from a setback. Then the alternatives would be to continue to carry an injured player on the 53, even as injuries at other positions may be mounting, or put Doctson on injured reserve. The team can bring one player back from IR during the course of the year but there may be a more important player on whom the team will have to use that one precious transaction.
(Note: In a change from the previous IR-return program the player who returns does not have to be designated before he goes on the list. Any one player who went on IR after the cut to 53 can be reactivated.)
We have some time for this to play out. Doctson was seen without the walking boot around training camp and Redskins Park for the last several days so perhaps that is a positive sign. But if he's still injured when it comes time to cut the roster there will be a decision of make and no matter which way they go there will be plenty of risk involved.

In case you missed it
Canadian fossil collectors from the Peace Region Paleontology Research Center in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, have discovered fossils of a stunning 240 million-year-old species of coelacanth.
Coelacanths are iconic fishes, well-known as living fossils. The group was thought to have died out with the dinosaurs until a living one was caught in 1938 off the coast of South Africa, sending shock waves through the scientific world.
The newly discovered species, described by two University of Alberta scientists in the recent issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, was a 3-foot long fish with a massive symmetrical forked tail quite unlike the tails of any other living or fossil coelacanths.
The fossils were discovered on rocky slopes in the Hart Ranges of Wapiti Lake Provincial Park in British Columbia, which at the time the fish was alive was off the western coast of the supercontinent Pangaea.
The species, named Rebellatrix divaricerca, meaning the “rebel coelacanth”, represents the first major change in body shape for the coelacanth group in more than 70 million years. The structure of this new fish is so unusual that it has been put in its own family.
“The reason for its unusual shape comes down to two possibilities,” said lead author Dr. Andrew Wendruff. “Either the fossil record of coelacanths is vastly undiscovered and there are others like it yet to be found, or this was a specific response following the Earth's greatest mass-extinction event at the end of the Permian , as coelacanths evolved to fill a vacant niche unoccupied by other predatory fishes.”
“Both the shape and the stiffness of the tail fin are unique amongst coelacanths,” explained Dr. Mark Wilson, co-author of the study. “Similar tail fins occur today in fast swimming predatory fishes such as tuna or barracuda, strongly suggesting that Rebellatrix was an active predator capable of fast bursts of swimming and high-speed cruising to search for and catch other fishes living in the ancient sea.”
“This is an amazing discovery which overturns the age old image of coelacanths as slow moving fishes and shows the resilience of the group to come back in true fighting form after surviving the world's most devastating mass extinction event,” said Dr. John Long of the Natural History Museum of LA County, an expert in fossil fishes who was not involved in the study.
Sci-News.com has also recently reported the discovery of the oldest known coelacanth species from the Early Devonian of Yunnan, China.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — During a night of vodka, cocaine, marijuana and video games, Joey Meek listened as a childhood buddy confided that he hated blacks so much he was going to kill them at a Charleston church.
Meek said he thought his friend was all talk until a week later, when news broke of a deadly shooting rampage at Emanuel AME church. But instead of calling authorities, Meek talked another friend out of going to police and giving them Dylann Roof's name. And then he lied to the FBI about his conversation with Roof.
For those crimes, Meek, 22, was sentenced Tuesday to more than two years in prison.
The punishment was handed down by the federal judge who presided at Roof's trial, which ended in January with the avowed white supremacist sentenced to death for massacring nine black people as they bowed their heads in prayer during a Wednesday night Bible study session on June 17, 2015.
Unlike Roof, Meek showed remorse for his crimes.
“I'm really, really sorry. A lot of beautiful lives were taken,” he said, reading from a statement.
He cried as he told the judge he fears retribution behind bars: “I don't know if I'll make it out of prison alive. I'm scared.”
U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel's 27-month prison term was the minimum punishment under federal sentencing guidelines. The government wanted a stiffer sentence to make an example out of Meek and because he could have stopped the massacre.
None of the victims' family members spoke in court, and they had no comment for reporters.
In a deal with prosecutors, Meek pleaded guilty to concealment of a crime and lying to the FBI.
Meek was not charged for failing to tell police about the impending attack, since that is not a crime under federal law. Instead, he was prosecuted for stopping a friend immediately after the slaughter from calling the police to report Roof as a suspect.
The judge said Meek's actions delayed Roof's capture for hours, during which Roof easily could have massacred more people somewhere else.
If Meek “had just gone in his bedroom and cried and regretted not reporting, he would have committed no federal crime,” Gergel said.
Meek and Roof, also 22, met in middle school, drifted apart during their high school years and then reconnected months before the shooting. Meek is the only person with whom Roof is known to have shared his murderous plans.
Meek told the FBI that he didn't report the conversation or call police even after hearing about the shootings in Charleston because he was on probation for burglary and was worried he would get in more trouble.
He also said he was so scared after hearing about the massacre that he wondered if he needed to get a gun to protect himself from Roof.
“Joey sincerely hopes that anyone who has a friend who is talking about hurting someone will take it seriously, learn from his mistake and notify the proper authorities immediately,” his attorney Deborah Barbier said outside court.
Meek sent each victim's family a handwritten letter of apology, pointing out qualities he admired about their loved one. He ended each letter the same way: “I ask for your forgiveness, but I don't expect it.”

We expect that some readers will not consider this a monumentally important political news story, but we were simply fascinated to learn that Kentucky's junior senator, Republican Rand Paul, cuts his own hair.
Senator Paul confirmed to The Hill's Judy Kurtz that he does, indeed, perform his own tonsorial maintenance on his curly locks. An aide to Sen. Paul told Kurtz that the senator is his own barber more out of necessity and a lack of time than anything else. The staffer points out that Paul does get his hair professionally trimmed … sometimes.
It was less than three years ago that Beverly Hills stylist Joseph Torrenueva leaked to the Washington Post that one of his haircuts for Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards cost $1,250.
And, who can forget that wonderful 1993 Thomas Friedman story in The New York Times, about the time two of Los Angeles International Airport's four runways were shut down for nearly an hour, while Air Force One sat on the tarmac with engines running -- all so that President Bill Clinton's Beverly Hills hairstylist, Chistophe, could come aboard and give Mr. Clinton a high-price trim before he took off for Washington.
Federal Aviation Administration spokesmen were quoted by The Associated Press as saying that while Air Force One sat on the runway on an indefinite haircut hold, two of the airport's four runways were shut down and some commuter flights scheduled to land were forced to circle instead. The White House insisted, though, that the Secret Service had not sought any special hold on air traffic while the President was getting his locks shorn.
What is it about Democrats and their haircuts? The self-styled “party of the working man” would be well advised to emulate some of the thrifty habits of Republicans such as Kentucky's Senator Rand Paul. On second thought, a politician who devotes his life to spending other people's money would come across as somewhat hypocritical if he started cutting his own hair and shining his own shoes, wouldn't he?
Never mind.

Phyllis Schlafly compared Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan in her final article written just hours before her death. ( Reuters photo )
Just hours before her passing on Monday night, conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly submitted what would be her final words to World Net Daily.
In that final article, the 92-year-old grass-roots activist compared Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's recent visit to Mexico with a similar meeting decades ago between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Both meetings exhibited a no-surrender approach to a key policy issue.
Reagan's no-surrender pledge was his unwavering commitment to the Strategic Defense Initiative, that is, to build and deploy a system to shoot down Soviet nuclear missiles headed for our cities. With Trump, it's his rock-solid promise to build "an impenetrable physical wall" on our southern border.
"Both Reagan's and Trump's signature ideas were purely defensive weapons to which no country could have any legitimate complaint," she wrote. "Reagan's SDI was a non-nuclear weapon whose only function was to destroy or deflect incoming nuclear missiles.

"Reagan stuck to that non-negotiable position at the summit with Gorbachev the following year in Reykjavik, Iceland. As we now know, that's when Gorby realized he could never win an open competition with the United States, so that his "acceptable second-best position" was the dissolution of the USSR over the next five years.
"Likewise, Donald Trump's wall is not a provocative, but a neighborly idea to stop the rampant illegality that harms both nations along the U.S.-Mexico border. With no legitimate objection to erecting a fence, wall or other physical barrier between our two countries, Mexico should be grateful for Trump's leadership and even agree to help pay for it."
Schlafly said the wall's value is based in preventing murderers and rapists from freely crossing back and forth at the U.S.-Mexico border. But, she noted, not every Mexican immigrant is are a murder, a rapist, drunk driver or drug dealer.
"Voters finally have the opportunity to choose a president who will make America first by securing our border and ending one-sided trade deals that favor foreign workers rather than our own," she concluded. "Trump's strong stance in his meeting with the Mexican president demonstrates that Donald Trump is the 'choice, not an echo.'"

NEW DELHI: It seems Pakistan is ever looking for fresh routes to push in Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) into India. After China, it's Cambodia which has emerged as the new destination for routing fake currency. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) intercepted and seized a consignment of Rs 1.5 crore in FICN in Cambodia two weeks ago.According to DRI, the consignment had come from the UK and was headed to India before it was intercepted with help from local agencies.On June 22, DRI had similarly apprehended a courier with Rs 30 lakh in fake currency addressed to a Delhi restaurant. The courier had been sent from China's Shenzhen province. Two days later another consignment of comparable value was apprehended at Birganj in Nepal. This consignment had come stuffed in electronic dolls from Hong Kong.The development had rattled intelligence agencies as it pointed to the fact that Pakistan's spy agency ISI had developed well-entrenched footprints in China and could push in more than just FICN in days to come. ISI has already made its presence felt in China's restive Xinjiang province and China has openly criticized elements in Pakistan for fanning terrorism in the region.DRI DG Najib Shah said, “We never thought FICN could be pushed through China but we apprehended two consignments in matter of days. Now we see it is being pushed through Cambodia. These are all cause for concern as FICN cartels are devising new ways and routes as authorities become strict on traditional routes of Nepal and Bangladesh. However, we are prepared to face the challenges.”In the last fiscal, DRI had seized FICN worth Rs 2.02 crore, while this year the figure has already touched Rs 0.76 crore.Until recently, the traditional routes of FICN smuggling were Dubai, Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia. However, strict vigilance by enforcement authorities on these routes and some recent operations by intelligence agencies in these countries have considerably set back the established networks. This has led to cartels looking for as yet untested routes and countries where Indian agencies have limited influence.
Vacula also wanted attention from Stephanie, so like me, she obliged. Unlike me, she read the whole post, which I lacked the motivation or interest to do. It's good that she did, because she looked at one passage that is quite sinister. Vacula wrote:
Whether we consider classrooms, internet forums/blogs, or the hostile climate against atheists, it should be understood that nasty people exist. The nastiness is, of course, unfortunate. We can work to change this nastiness and hope that people will be nice, but this just isn't the case and likely won't be in the near future. We should, then, make responsible decisions based on our environments. If you don't get along with another student in class, avoid interactions with that student.
Ah but mere not getting along is not the issue. (How I do keep repeating that, don't I. That's because they keep misrepresenting what the issue is. It's not disagreement, it's not dissent, it's not criticism, it's not not getting along. It's not. That's not it.) Mere not getting along is not the issue. The issue is a determined campaign of persecution.
That's different, you see. You can't avoid it by simply avoiding interactions with that student. The student pursues you, to pursue the determined campaign of persecution. You can't avoid it unless you leave the school altogether, and maybe not even then.
Also, we already know that what Vacula says is bad public policy. It's a cowardly do-nothing failure. Teachers and principals who tell a persecuted student to just “avoid interactions” with the persecutor are not doing their jobs. Their job is to make the persecutor stop, not to make the persecuted hide.
It's not “responsible” to decide that because you are being persecuted, it is your duty to stop doing what you were doing when the persecutor decided to target you. It's responsible to stay off the road during a hurricane; it's responsible to evacuate low-lying areas as a hurricane approaches; it is not responsible to decide not to say things because there are vicious people who will respond by calling you a fucking cunt.
Vacula went on:
If you can't handle negative feedback online and have received it many times, disengage and write about another topic (or stop writing).
Ah well now that really is blunt. Thank you. Now we know where we are. If you “can't handle” being called a fucking cunt, then stop writing.
Those are our choices. Be called a fucking cunt, and ugly, old, fat; be photoshopped; be misrepresented and lied about; be relentlessly harassed via Twitter and trolling; or stop writing.
That's just how it is. We were irresponsible enough to decide to be women, so there it is. We can write, or we can avoid constant harassment; we can't do both. As Stewart said yesterday (and Stephanie quoted him): The real message is “being a woman does not entitle you to protection from the extra hostility you get for being a woman.”

Choosing the data weighting is inherently subjective. We believe that social media, at least in terms of consumer (and to a lesser extent industry) influence is extremely important, hence the relatively high weighting.
The Weighting: “45% Traffic Score (Alexa US Rank) + 35% Social Score (Facebook Fans + Twitter Followers) + 5% Moz Domain Authority + 10% Moz Unique Linking Domains.”
We are well aware of the issues with Alexa data (see caveats below), which is why we also included the data points from Moz's Open Site Explorer web crawl.
Our Data Sources
We used publicly available data, collected on Dec 11, 2013 and Dec 12, 2013. The Moz Open Site Explorer Data is from the Dec 10, 2013 crawl. Data was manually collected. In the short term we intend to update our index manually; over the long term we may automate our data collection to allow for a daily updated index.
Our Observations
How We Selected Who To Include
Putting together an index like this is inherently subjective. If you believe we've excluded a property that belongs in the list, please let us know. Without diving into the why or why not of every wine related website on the Internet, we'll address some properties we considered, but ultimately excluded:
Cellar Tracker – While they are a large and influential brand, they really are a unique property that exists in its own category.
– While they are a large and influential brand, they really are a unique property that exists in its own category. Decanter – While we enjoy reading Decanter they're focused on the UK.
– While we enjoy reading Decanter they're focused on the UK. Palate Press – We decided to look at the individual influential websites within their ad network.
– We decided to look at the individual influential websites within their ad network. James Suckling's web venture, which we won't be linking to. All that needs to be said about the man has been said elsewhere…and we'll leave it at that.
Raw Data & Feedback
In the table below you can see our raw data. Have a better way to weight the data, or more to include? We'd love to see what you have in mind. If you do produce a different set please let us know
Caveats Although we collected Quantcast traffic ranks, we ultimately excluded it from the index, despite our hope to account for Alexa outliers with a second dataset. We did so as for many lower traffic sites Quantcast data did not exist.
When a property did not have an Alexa US rank we used their global rank.
A couple of properties that do not have a Facebook presence, do have a public, personal presence belonging to the owner of the property. When appropriate and available we used the number of their ‘Followers.'
Based upon directly measured Quantcast data, we believe that Alexa is likely undercounting The Reverse Wine Snob's traffic. We believe this is also the case for Dr. Vino .
traffic. We believe this is also the case for . We recognize that mobile apps have additional, valuable datapoints to use for comparison. While we believe the relative ranks of the mobile apps included in the Index are accurate, we intend to dive deeper into the world of wine-related mobile apps in the near future!
The Raw Data
Update*
We've been overwhelmed by the feedback today and we wanted to provide a quick update. We enjoyed doing this, reading some interesting discussions, and we plan to release a full update sometime next year.
A note from Josh on the new data: There are some well-known, large websites that regularly write about wine. We at VinePair love a number of them. However comparing them against purely wine-oriented websites doesn't seem fair. You can find our scores for six additional properties in the second tab of the embedded raw data, although we want to strongly note that this data was recorded today, whereas the original set is from the 12th. And now some more notes & caveats — based upon directly measured Quantcast data we believe that our score for Enobytes is dragged down by the lack of US-only Alexa data. Alexa's data appears to be undercounting Hello Vino. We believe Wine Maps, to a lesser extent is also scoring lower than it should. As to the original exclusion of Robert Parker's website, that was an editorial decision we took.
The chaps at Phoronix have confirmation from Valve that the developer are working on a Linux version of their platform-bestriding distribution system, and are even hiring new Linux developers. Phoronix have apparently spoken directly to Mr Newell, who was quite keen on the open-source platform. They report: “His level of Linux interest and commitment was incredible while his negativity for Windows 8 and the future of Microsoft was stunning. In fact, as soon as I return to my office this weekend I plan to try out Windows 8 simply to see if it's as bad as Gabe states…” I think that says quite a lot, eh Linux fans? It's also incredibly significant in terms of the viability of Linux as a gaming OS, and I am certain there will be an enormous amount of speculation about what that could mean.
Thanks to everyone who sent in this story. I am certain there will be more news from the horse's mouth in the coming weeks.
A modern classic!
Scratchy black and white images of wars past flicker across the screen as a clunky transistor radio tunes in an old single by the Inkspots. "War. War never changes." With those iconic words, thus begins the best computer game I've ever played. Like the best movies, Fallout pulls you in from the beginning with an all-encompassing combination of art design, soundtrack, and storyline that makes you wish you lived in this Post-Apocalyptic retro-future. Not just for RPG fans, it really deserves to be played by anyone interested in a good story and an unforgettable game experience. In terms of gameplay, this game was quite innovative for it's time. You'll start out with a familiar character creation screen. A few added bonuses like the selection of "perks" (special character traits that usually boost some skills at the expense of others) and specialized skills allow you to cater the gameplay to your preferred style. Would be diplomats should take note, however, that the open-endedness of this design does presuppose a certain amount of combat so don't expect to talk your way out of every situation, no matter how high you boost your negotiation skills. The real choice in gameplay is rather limited to whether you'd prefer using handguns and rocket launchers or spears, knives, and good old fashioned fists. Once this limitation is understood, however, the choices you make here really do affect the game. Most of the game is played from an isometric overhead perspective. Breaks from this view occur only when you travel long distances on a static area map or enter conversation with key characters. The background environments you travel through are rendered in exacting detail and are absolutely gorgeous. They still hold up pretty well compared to more modern games. When the game does zoom in for a headshot during conversations with key characters, it's a real treat. The quality of animation in these sequences is the best in the game. It's not exactly photo-real, but it's very good and the quirkiness of the characters makes up for any lack of detail. Some caveats-- the game can be very violent. There's an option to turn down the graphic violence (or turn it up, if you'd prefer) so it might be this is less of a problem, but it is something to be aware of. Wandering the wastelands, evidently, can be a pretty grissly affair. As I alluded to before, combat makes up a large portion of the game. The story points you're required to carry out will often pit you against armed adversaries with no way to win but to shoot your way out, or in. Once you get past all the combat, however, the intriguing characters you meet and the story developing around them more than makes up for any tedium. Tedium's probably not the right word, because I enjoyed the combat in the game quite a bit. By the end, you'll find yourself fighting the same sorts of armed mutants and giant scorpians a lot though. If that's not your thing, I can reassure you that the storyline is good and worth playing for. There's not much else I can say, I think I covered all the bases. If you can get this game with the original manual and box art, do it! Print manuals and gamebox art seem to be a dying breed, which is a shame because the ones originally included with this game were gorgeous. You can hang them on your wall. Games this complete and original and fun to play don't come along all that often, it really set the bar for computer RPGs at the time it came out and remains to this day a classic.Read full review
As U.S.-Pakistan relations continue to descend to new, new lows, a new report suggests the U.S. is attempting to salvage the relationship by pausing drone strikes targeted at suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban militants in Pakistan.
The strikes are “on hold” at the moment, U.S. intelligence officials involved in the CIA program told The Long War Journal, out of fear they would further harm the fragile relationship.
“We may strike soon if an extremely high-value target pops up, but otherwise there is hesitation to pull the trigger right now,” an unnamed senior U.S. intelligence official told the security blog.
Relations have deteriorated significantly since NATO airstrikes on Nov. 26 mistakenly killed 26 Pakistani soldiers. The attack was widely viewed in Pakistan as an intentional act of aggression and prompted Pakistan to close NATO supply routes to Afghanistan and expel the CIA from the Shamsi airbase in Balochistan, from which it operated the drones.
According to the Journal, the last known drone strike in Pakistan occurred on Nov. 17. The last time the U.S. halted drone strikes in Pakistan was while Raymond Davis, a CIA security officer who shot two Pakistanis dead on a crowded Lahore street on Jan. 27, was held in a Lahore jail for seven weeks on murder charges. On March 17, the day after Davis was released, the CIA launched a deadly strike in North Waziristan. American officials say “a large group of heavily armed men, some of whom were clearly connected to Al Qaeda,” were killed but others have said the strike targeted a jirga meeting of tribesmen loyal to the government. (Read contradictory accounts about the targets of the March strike here.)
In addition to enraging Pakistani civil and military leadership, the timing of the March strike exacerbated a rift between the CIA and State Department over the covert program. According to the Associated Press, U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter had appealed to then-CIA director Leon Panetta to stop the imminent drone strike, but “U.S. officials said Leon Panetta's decision was driven by anger at Pakistan for imprisoning Raymond Davis for so long and a belief that the militants being targeted were too important to pass up.”
That airstrike fueled a debate in Washington that led to tightened restrictions on drone policy, according to The Wall Street Journal:
Among the changes: The State Department won greater sway in strike decisions; Pakistani leaders got advance notice about more operations; and the CIA agreed to suspend operations when Pakistani officials visit the U.S.
It is unclear what impact the tightened rules and latest cessation of strikes will have in Pakistan. U.S. officials have said the drone program has killed more than 1,500 suspected militants in Pakistan since President Obama took office in 2009. The CIA recently launched a drone program targeting militants in Yemen, modeled after the program in Pakistan.
MonkeyParking, the Italian startup that was recently ordered to cease and desist by the San Francisco City Attorney, has remained defiant.
”We are not stopping any service as we know we are not illegal, so there is no reason to do it,” Paolo Dobrowolny, the company's CEO, told Ars.
On Monday, San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera cited a city code that forbids drivers who "enter into a lease, rental agreement, or contract of any kind" for public parking spots. The violation is punishable by up to $300 in fines.
MonkeyParking's app lets users auction off their public parking spaces. The Rome-based company has until July 11, 2014 to comply, and then it could face a lawsuit brought by the city. In addition to the City by the Bay, the startup also operates in the Italian capital.
In a statement sent to Ars, MonkeyParking claimed that it was, in fact, not auctioning off public parking spaces. Rather, the company says it auctions off information about the parking spaces.
“The real issue here is that a local ordinance is being misapplied to wrongfully target our service,” the company said. “This is happening with our company and other companies operating in the social sharing space. This is yet another example of a local ordinance that was drafted in a world pre-shared economy which local authorities are improperly applying to a shared economy service.”
The startup also claims that its users have the First Amendment right to express and sell such information.
“We are consulting with legal counsel as we speak, but we are confident that we would prevail any such legal challenge against our service," the company said.
Profile The purpose of this website is to propagate Buddha Dharma to the whole world. As we all know that this is the Dharma-Ending age, Buddhism is getting weaker whereas our worldy desires grow stronger. As said before by Shakyamuni Buddha (Scripture Preached by the Buddha on the Total Extinction of the Dharma), in this Dharma-Ending age all Buddhist-Sutras will disappear slowly one by one, starting with Shurangama Sutra and the last one to be Amitabha Infinite Life Sutra. After the first sutra is gone, the world will start to enter a chaotic time where evil deeds will become daily routines. Excerpt from Shurangama Sutra:
..."In fifty-two years after that, the Shurangama Scripture and the pratyutpanna-samádhi will prematurely change and vanish, and shortly afterwards the twelve divisions of the Mahayana canon will also be destroyed in their entirety, and will not appear again. The robes of the monks will spontaneously turn white. "When my Dharma is destroyed, the process will be comparable to an oil lamp, which, drawing close to the time it will go out, will shed an even greater radiance and brilliance, and then be extinguished. When my Dharma is destroyed, it will surely be like a lamp going out.... Excerpt from Infinite Life Sutra:
... The Buddha further said, "I have expounded this teaching for the sake of sentient beings and enabled you to see Amitayus and all in his land. Strive to do what you should. After I have passed into Nirvana, do not allow doubt to arise. In the future, the Buddhist scriptures and teachings will perish. But, out of pity and compassion, I will especially preserve this sutra and maintain it in the world for a hundred years more. Those beings who encounter it will attain deliverance in accord with their aspirations. The Buddha said to Maitreya, "It is difficult to encounter and behold Tathagata when he is in this world. Difficult of access, difficult to hear are the Buddhas' teachings and scriptures. It is also difficult to hear the excellent teachings for bodhisattvas, the Paramitas. Difficult too is it to meet a good teacher, to hear the Dharma and perform the practices. But most difficult of all difficulties is to hear this sutra, have faith in it with joy and hold fast to it. Nothing is more difficult than this. Thus have I formed my Dharma, thus have I expounded my Dharma, and thus have I taught my Dharma. You must receive it and practice it by the method prescribed."...
This website hosts the complete list of all the Buddhist Sutras, including the Shurangama and Infinite Life Sutra. Hopefully we all can keep this site up and running for a long period of time, thus prolonging the sutra disappearance from happening.
PoliZette Now What? It will be the most brutal, vicious two weeks in GOP primary history — here's what to expect
The takeaway for the GOP Establishment — and its enablers at places like National Review and RedState — will be that Marco Rubio's win in Minnesota, combined with Cruz's victories in Texas and Oklahoma and the close-ish race in Virginia, show that Donald Trump can be stopped. They just have to keep going negative.
Remember that the GOP's answer to any defeat is to “surge” — losing simply encourages it to try harder with the same basic tactics and strategy. In this case, the way they're going to think about it is that Rubio almost caught Trump in Virginia by calling him a “con artist” and going relentlessly negative. So, they will reason, if we hit Trump with two weeks' worth of unlimited negative ads in Florida, we can beat him there on March 15. And once Rubio has the 99 winner-take-all delegates from Florida, we can argue that he has the momentum and the support of the people to continue the fight all the way to the convention.

The calendar slows down a lot after March 15, and they will think that they can use the time between March 15 and the end of the process to rally people against Trump. They believe that if Trump doesn't wrap it up soon, he will eventually lose. That will be their mantra.
[lz_related_box id=”113920″]
There's no point in complaining about this. Trump represents a potentially existential threat to the Donor Class, and it makes sense that they would use every trick in their toolbox to beat him. Plus, if he can't survive the onslaught that's coming in the next two weeks, I'm not sure he could survive against Hillary. There was always going to be a time where if Trump started to represent a true threat to their power, that they would do everything they could to destroy him. I think he's understood this from the beginning. And now that time has come.
Everything will be fair game. His businesses. His wives. His temperament. Everything he ever did or said. It will be one of the most brutal two weeks we've ever seen. But he is playing for the highest of stakes, and this is the sort of thing you have to survive if you're going to beat the champs of political scorched earth — the Clintons.
How Trump Can Defeat the Negative Onslaught
At the same time, this primary season has demonstrated that the Establishment has some real problems. It's clear that Rubio is a deeply flawed candidate. It's clear he struggles to reach people who aren't already committed to the Establishment Agenda. It's clear that the voters are screaming “NO!” to the Establishment's agenda — they have rejected it in almost every state by almost overwhelming numbers. Even in the Minnesota caucuses, where Rubio benefited from a much smaller turnout than we are seeing in the states with primaries, over 50 percent of the reported vote went to Cruz, Trump, or Carson. The Establishment can be beaten in this campaign — the numbers are there, the issues are there. It can be done.
And Trump can do it. To win the nomination, he needs to do four things, all of which are very much in his power:
Advertisement
1.) Keep the focus on the big issues — his plan to re-negotiate the terms of globalization so that it will work better for the American people, and to re-focus our foreign policy to better protect American interests. For the most part, he has won the debate on these points — which is why Rubio so rarely talks about them.
2.) Respond to the onslaught of attacks against him in a more balanced manner. Trump's giving too much oxygen to stupid issues — hand size, sweating, spray-tan quality, tweet misspellings. Better to have a “spitballs off a battleship”-type response. “Poor Marco can't tell us how he's going to create job. But he does have a future on ‘The Last Comic Standing.'” The food fights that the media will try to drag Trump into are only designed to scare voters away from him.
3.) Push back on the notion that he's a closet liberal who won't do what he says — and remind GOP voters of the many times the preferred candidates of the Establishment (like Rubio) changed their positions once they got into office.
4.) Focus more of his attacks on the failures of the Obama administration — and of Hillary Clinton, who is now trying to pretend that she had nothing to do with the policies that have done so much damage to this economy. The one thing that all Republicans can agree on is that the country can't take four more years of the Clinton-Obama team —and the vast majority of Republicans will welcome any candidate who can prevent such an outcome.
Cruz Must Help Break the Establishment
Meanwhile, Ted Cruz and his people have their own decisions to make. They are not in a pleasant position — they are trying to be principled conservatives at a time when most of the party is going for either Establishment-style moderation or populism.
Many of us have a strong affinity for Cruz and his people, and after winning three states, he should resist any entreaties from Rubio who will try to buy him off. But as the race goes forward, I would urge them to pay close attention to the example of Jeff Sessions. As Sen. Sessions properly recognizes, unless and until the grip of the bipartisan Establishment is broken, the GOP can never, ever be the party of principled conservatism — it can only be a place where conservative ideas go to die.
Yes, there will be times when the populists disappoint pure conservatives. But populists and pure conservatives each have the same basic goal — a great country where the average person has a chance at a better life. By contrast, the Establishment already has what it wants and will do everything it can to maintain the status quo. Ted Cruz and his supporters have to make their own decision, but in the long run they need a major shakeup in the GOP Establishment to have a chance of seeing their ideas become law. Rubio (and his donors) have no intention of making such a change. In fact, they will support policies — open borders, new trade deals, more government debt — that will make any such change much harder to achieve.

(CNN) If you think "my teen would never sext," you might be mistaken.
And if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high-risk behaviors, like drinking, using drugs or skipping school, keep reading.
Two recent studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit.
More than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sexted when they were teenagers, according to the study by Drexel University, which was published in June by the Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy.
Nearly 30% said they included photos in their sexts, and an astonishing 61% did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography.
Another study, this one by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, found that while students who admitted sexting were 32% more likely to report having sex the next year, sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time.
The study, published in the journal Pediatrics in October, found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners, use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control.
Sexting may be the new "normal' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior, the study concluded.
"There are now a few pieces of research, which are sort of converging on the same finding, namely that this is not a rare behavior," said Elizabeth Englander , a professor of psychology at Bridgewater State University and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center.
"I'm not saying that it's healthy or that it's harmless, but it's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self-esteem are doing it," said Englander, who researched sexting, as well as a host of other teenager behaviors, for her recent book "Bullying and Cyberbullying."
"It appears to be widespread. It's engaged in by many kids who are functioning well and not having problems and it's not very unusual or rare."
Diana Graber, who teaches "cybercivics" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, was blown away by the response she got recently from eighth graders when she, for the first time, included a session on sexting.
When she asked her students if they knew what a sext was, everyone in the class said they did, but what they didn't know was what the penalties for sending a sext could be, including how it could be prosecuted as a felony under child pornography laws in some states.
"They had no idea what the consequences were," said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. "I mean that was a complete surprise to literally all 28 kids, so it occurred to me that no one's ever bothered to tell these kids they couldn't do that."
Graber said she experienced another first that day. A few students wanted to hang around after the class, which is held at the end of the school day, to talk more about sexting and related things.
"That's never happened to me before with this class ... and I realized that I had created a safe space for them to talk about something that was super relevant to their lives."
She now plans to make it part of her "cybercivics" curriculum, and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting. It should be part of sex education, she said.
"It's very normal teenage behavior ... and we need to get with the times and get ahead of the problem, and just have these very easy to have discussions."
Englander, the psychology professor and researcher, says in her experience, it's not that adults aren't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public.
The problem, she says, does kids don't hear the warnings because the reality doesn't fit them.
In a recent online article , she used an example of telling someone to use a seat belt because half the car rides in the country result in someone going through the windshield. Since half of car rides don't result in someone going through the windshield, a person might not listen to that warning, she says.
"If you want to convince somebody that something is a danger, you have to convince them that you know what you're talking about, " said Englander. "So you can't say to kids 'Oh, you are going to go to jail if you sext.' It's not 100% impossible but even in the early cases of sexting, when (law enforcement) did prosecute kids, they didn't go to jail."
"People have a hard time with this. It's not that I'm saying we shouldn't teach kids that child pornography is a crime. It is a crime, but if we emphasize that that's the big danger then we've lost our audience."
Englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext, especially if they felt pressured to do it.
In her own research , she said she found that 92% of the teens who said they were not pressured to sext reported no problems afterward, but that number is only 68% for teens who felt pressured into doing it.
"They felt crummy afterwards," said Englander. "That was actually the most common result, that they just felt worse."
Lori Cunningham, founder of Well Connected Mom, a site specializing in simplifying technology for families, said parents need to remind their children about their own self-worth.
"And that no matter how tempting it is to want to be 'liked' by someone, they are worth more than degrading themselves for someone else's enjoyment," said Cunningham, a mom of two in Los Angeles. "If parents aren't having this conversation, their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure."
Cunningham also says parents need to be actively involved in their children's online lives. In a new eBook, she outlines the points parents should go over with their child when they get a phone, including setting up a contract so they understand their phone will be monitored.
"Phones are a privilege, not a right. They should only be given to kids with the expectation that mom or dad will be checking it on a daily basis."
What all the experts believe is that parents and educators should be talking to kids about obeying the law, protecting their privacy and reputation, and respecting everyone's right to keep their bodies private, but also their own values about the issue.
"Your kids can go into these things knowing absolutely nothing, having no idea of what you think is right or wrong, having no idea of the facts or you can talk to them about it. Those are the only two choices," said Englander. "I don't think in today's world you can assume that they're never going to run across sexting, they're never going to see it, they're never going to know it happens."
"That's a big assumption to make."
All dogs go to heaven—but maybe they don't have to. Scientist Matt Kaeberlein thinks he may have discovered a cure for canine aging.
Kaeberlein, a biologist at the University of Washington, has been conducting experiments for decades that explore how factors like genetics and calorie consumption affect how we age, and whether there are drugs that might be able to slow the process. This year he and a colleague, Daniel Promislow, began a clinical trial to test whether a drug called rapamycin that has been known to increase the lifespan of mice might do the same for dogs; he says the results of a preliminary study are astonishing. And he's already thinking about what it could mean to give the drug to the dogs' owners.
"I was shocked when I got the data," he said. "It is almost certain that rapamycin can slow the effects of aging in dogs and people. The only question is whether it can slow aging with doses that don't have significant side effects."
Kaeberlein, a dog lover with two pooches of his own, wanted to use people's pet dogs to study aging for a few reasons. For one, dogs are a great proxy for human research: the conditions in which dogs live are much closer to our own than the lives of laboratory mice. Dogs also age much faster than we do—the average lifespan of a dog is just 10 to 13 years—meaning that scientists can study the entire aging process in just a few short years. Plus, helping dogs live longer benefits their human owners, too.
"If we can delay aging in people's pets," he told me, "it will directly improve their quality of life at the same time that it provides insight into human aging."

In his initial experiment, which concluded in March, 40 people gave their dogs tablets of rapamycin three times a week. Kaeberlein then took several echocardiograms of the dogs over a 10-week period to determine the effect of the drug on heart function.
Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive drug that acts like a volume knob for what's known as the mTOR pathway, which regulates cellular signals including cellular growth. The presence of rapamycin can help slow cell aging, interfering with the ability of the mTOR pathway's ability to pick up on those signals that cause cells to grow; the more rapamycin is present, theoretically, the more signal interference. The drug is frequently used in transplant patients, to help prevent an organ's rejection, and to stem the growth of certain types of cancer.
Kaeberlein's initial trial tested low doses of the drug on large, middle-aged dogs, to ensure that it didn't do long-term damage. After some dogs were weeded out for heart conditions and other factors, 24 dogs completed the double-blind trial. The results, which have yet to be published, found that the dogs that received the drug showed heart functionality that either improved or remained the same (in dogs, 10 weeks is enough time to potentially see some cardiac decline). The dogs that had come in with worse cardiac conditions seemed to improve the most.

These results are promising, but preliminary—just 24 dogs is a small study, and the effects of rapamycin were only measured over a few weeks. But it suggests something promising: just like in mice, it seems rapamycin may indeed help dogs stay healthy longer. Kaeberlein now plans to run years-long trials on dogs. And he's hopeful rapamycin might even be approved for people by the next decade.
Kaeberlein isn't the only scientist wondering whether rapamycin might be a fountain of youth—it's one of the most promising anti-aging drugs currently being tested in labs. In 2009, researchers at the University of Texas showed it could extend the lives of older mice by between 9 and 14 percent. Subsequent studies found that rapamycin had similar effect on middle-aged mice, and that with higher doses that number could climb as high as 30 percent. In mice, it also seemed to slow age-related diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.
In 2014, the drug company Novartis revealed that it had tested a compound derived from rapamycin on elderly humans and that it had successfully increased immune response to a flu vaccine by 20 percent. Like Kaeberlein's study, it was preliminary—the study only looked at immune response over a short period of time—but it also suggested rapamycin might eventually extend the lives of people, too.

Many scientists in the aging field feel that if rapamycin can extend the lifespan of mice by up to 30 percent, it should be able to do the same for people, too. The question, Kaeberlein told me, is not so much whether rapamycin might help slow the aging process for humans, but whether you can do so without creating side effects that make living longer seem less worth it.
In rats, for example, rapamycin can cause infertility.
"You have to ask, is that a fair trade-off for an extra 15 percent of healthy longevity?" Kaeberlein said. "When we are talking about aging interventions, the tolerance for side effects is less. There's a difference between quality and quantity of life and the goal is a balance of the two."

There are other drugs out that that might also one day help us all live longer. Metformin, a diabetes drug that has also been shown to extend life in mice, will soon be tested in non-diabetic elderly people to see whether it might prevent age-related ailments such as cancer, stroke and dementia. Resveratrol, a compound found grapes and blueberries, is also being studied for its anti-aging benefits.
But Kaeberlein is most excited about rapamycin.
"Helping people's pets live longer will go a long ways toward convincing people that it should also be tried in humans," he told me. "Everything about biological science says that it should work the same in humans."
Lew Robertson / Corbis Fresh brownies baked with marijuana
April 20 has a special significance in America. It is known among pot smokers as Weed Day, with the date having been chosen for the same hazy reason 4:20 p.m. is widely regarded as a good time to light up (although no one can quite remember how the tradition got started). Weed Day is hardly a secret. In fact, it's a celebration, just as cooking with weed is ceasing to be a novelty. Someday we may look back to the publication of The Official High Times Cannabis Cookbook this spring as a turning point.
(MORE: Adam Cohen: Legal Recreational Marijuana: Not So Far Out)
This is not to say the cookbook is all that impressive. No one is going to confuse it with The Essentials of Italian Cooking. But the recipes are serious ones that attempt to do something more with marijuana than just bake it into cookies or brownies. Most of them fall into the general category of party treats, from pico de ganja nachos to sativa-shrimp spring rolls. These dishes may not sound that great, but they're an enormous improvement on what aspiring stoners have choked down over the years. Alice B. Toklas' 1954 cookbook famously (and inadvertently, thanks to her wiseass friend, who slipped in the recipe) introduced the world to “hashish fudge,” an unspeakably nasty recipe that doesn't even call for cooking the weed! You just crumble it up with fruits and nuts and add some sugar and butter. Eventually, civilization developed the art of steeping marijuana in gently simmering butter, once it was found that the drug's active ingredient, THC, was fat-soluble. But the baked goods produced were never as good as regular brownies, nor were they as convenient THC delivery systems as, say, skull-shaped water pipes or Zig-Zag cigarette papers.
That's changing, thanks to a generation of cooks in their 20s and 30s who grew up professionally in a cloud of smoke. It's well known that some of the best chefs in the country use pot as a new version of the “green muse” favored by the absinthe-soaked poets of 19th century Paris; the appearance of ubiquitous “stoner cuisine” dishes like poutine and candied pork belly speaks to the trend. But sophisticated cooking with weed has, until recently, been a well-kept secret.

It's still not really out; the High Times cookbook is still pretty amateur stuff. The real cutting-edge weed cookery is generally done at home, or at invite-only dinners like the one Los Angeles Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold attended a couple of weeks ago. There are two approaches, which correspond predictably to the two main strands of contemporary cooking. One involves treating pot like the herb it is and either infusing it into butter or olive oil, and adding its unmistakable taste to dishes where it would be welcome — like an herbaceous pesto risotto one chef I knew used to do, using only the very best kief or fine powder, or the ethereal olive oil, garlic and pot emulsion I was once offered binding a microgreen salad. The other method, straight out of modernist cuisine, reduces the active ingredients in marijuana to a tasteless elixir of pure THC oil, administered by eyedropper and added to dishes in which it is barely discernible. Gold was disappointed by this approach. For example, in one complicated prawn dish, “[pot] appeared as a flavor really only as part of an epazote puree dotting a shallow bowl of rice porridge with nettles and monkfish,” the Pulitzer-winning critic noted. His companion, the High Times staffer who wrote the new cookbook, agreed: “It's funny, you hardly tasted the cannabis at all. Usually the problem is the opposite — it has such a strong, sweet-nutty flavor that the trick is covering it up, often with chocolate. Either he's a really good chef, or I'm missing something.”
It sounds like the latter to me. But I like the fact that chefs are trying at all. There's no reason why pot dispensaries like the ones on the West Coast should limit their production to sweet snacks like brownies, cookies and Rice Krispies treats. The point about marijuana that the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and other groups have made for years is that it's not a destructive vice indulged in by deviants, but a pleasure and a relief for a lot of Americans — sick and well — who continue, amazingly, to hold down jobs and raise healthy families. Therefore, it shouldn't just come in the form of childish treats, or be huffed out of a turkey bag, as is the current medium of choice for high-end potheads.
I'm not going to declare my support for pot legalization — not because I don't support it, but because the arguments in its favor are so well known that it would be pointless to reiterate them. But I can say that I am strongly in favor of mixing pleasure with nutrition, of humanizing even bad habits and of trying to cook as well as possible with the ingredients that matter most to you. For better or for worse, marijuana is becoming an accepted part of mainstream American culture. Maybe it's time for pot brownies to go the way of bathtub gin.

Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal later said he had "not meant to hurt anyone."
Samajwadi Party lawmaker Naresh Agarwal had the government benches in the Rajya Sabha up in angry protest today when he referred to Hindu Gods in comments that have been expunged or removed from records. The Upper House of Parliament had to be adjourned amid loud protests.Mr Agarwal has since expressed regret.Since the comments have been expunged, they cannot be reported. The Samajwadi Party lawmaker was speaking in a fractious debate in the house on recent incidents of mob lynching and murders in the name of cow protection when he made the comments."He has linked each of the Hindu Gods with a brand of alcohol. If he had made this statement outside Parliament, he would've been booked. Do you have the audacity of repeating this in relation to any other religious denomination? Would you do this?" said Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, demanding an apology.Mr Agarwal later said he had "not meant to hurt anyone."Earlier in the debate, he alleged that people linked to the BJP were behind recent mob attacks by cow vigilantes, which was firmly rejected by Minister of State for Home affairs Hansraj Gangaram Ahir.The minister drew protests from the opposition when he said states have all the powers to deal with such incidents and that there was no need to change existing laws. He said the home ministry has already issued an advisory to all states to immediately start registering FIRs in such cases and asked them to take action and arrest culprits. He also pointed out that the Prime Minister has spoken against killings in the name of cow protection which will not be tolerated. Samajwadi Party members came to the Well or Centre of the house and raised slogans expressing dissatisfaction over the government's reply to questions on the steps taken by the Centre to stop the mob murders.
[This is the first chapter of a novel I wrote, The Fall of Doc Future, set in a world similar to the present day, except with metahumans. I consider it Science Fiction or ‘Hard Fantasy'–there are unusual abilities, but I try to treat the consequences seriously and consistently. The main characters are Doc Future, the smartest man in the world, currently having issues with insomnia; his adopted daughter Flicker, a speedster and high functioning autistic; her best friend, Dr. Stella Reinhart, a mind control researcher who does a few other things as well; and Donner, a metahuman rock musician with an unusual voice. It's about 170k words. I will be publishing a cleaned up ebook version at some point, so watch this site if you are interested. Follow the previous and next links at the top and bottom of each chapter to read in chronological order. Enjoy! - WDR]
Doc Future was hunched over the old microscope in the makeshift lab when he heard the shift of air and slight crunch of debris. He looked up and saw Flicker standing in the doorway, the full visor and face mask of her costume up, as it always was these days. He could smell the faint whiff of decay anyway.
“Donner is dead." came the emotionless voice out of her synthesizer. Flicker's lungs didn't work anymore.
Doc rubbed his gritty eyes. "How - how did they get him?" His voice was hoarse with fatigue.
"Nerve gas during a concert. Over a hundred others died as well. They aren't even trying to reduce collateral damage anymore. It had been months since I'd even seen him, so I had hoped…" she said, then shrugged.
It was so hard to focus, he was so tired… "Was he the last?”
“Yes. Everyone who has ever been close to me is dead now, except for you." She was suddenly standing behind the bench, beside him, looking up at the four monitors he had rigged to satellite views. "It was clever of them to use the virus as an excuse. No one knew they made it and it was tailored to only hurt me.”
Doc looked around at the hideout, a former Colombian drug lab buried in the side of a hill. It wasn't much, but it was hidden, and it had power and a little equipment. “Yeah, well, if they hadn't nuked my Antarctic lab I might have been able to find a cure in time…”
“You wouldn't let me prevent them.” came the voice.
Doc's shoulders slumped. “You were right. I was wrong. That's all.”
She didn't reply, just kept looking at the monitor displays of the world from orbit.
“Uh, okay, look.” He gestured at the equipment on the bench. “There's no point in trying to beat the virus anymore, and cloning is out, but using your skeleton as anchor and framework, I think I can rig up a minimal-”
“No.”
“Flicker." he said, desperate now. "There has got to be something I can do, I won't let them-" Tiny alarms were screaming in his head. They seemed distant, unimportant.
"No, Doc. Thank you for trying, for everything, but my body is dead, and my connection to it is starting to fade. I've only been carrying it around as an anchor and for the communication in my costume. I haven't got much longer.”
The alarms were howling now, beating on the walls of his mind.
“My emotions are gone now, but I know what I would have wanted. Just hold me for a little while, before-”
“They don't deserve to be on the same world as you!" Doc raged. "They never have, any of them. I didn't see it soon enough to save you, I failed you. Show them! Before you go, show-”
Everything went red.
It was odd, he seemed to be seeing from a little ways behind and above as he watched his eyes roll back and his head loll as his body fell sideways. Flicker moved to catch it, and held it as his heart stilled after its last beat.
Nothing moved for a moment, then there was a burst of static and one of the displays changed to a head and shoulder recording of him. He knew Flicker's visor would be playing the same thing.
Hell, I never deactivated that. Not much point now.
“Flicker, if you are seeing this, I am dead. Probable cause of death is internal suicide override, triggered by primary cognitive block failure. If for some reason I'm not dead, then whatever is walking around around in my body likely isn't me, so take precautions. You're my heir, and full details will be available through the database, all restrictions on your access are lifted. There isn't much I can say other than I love you and have always been proud of you, and I hope-" Doc tuned out the rest, focusing on Flicker's form as she knelt over his fallen body, while the recording played to the end.
She stayed motionless for a while after it ended, then her head rose again to look at the displays. She remained that way for another long while, then was abruptly gone, debris stirred in her wake.
Pinpoints of light began to blossom on the orbital views. Doc cataloged them automatically.
Rural areas in North America - that would be the nuclear weapon sites, he thought as they spread across the other displays to China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Europe, Israel and elsewhere.
More lights, starting again in North America. Military bases. All of them, it looked like, including the ones in cities. He watched as they spread across the world, joined by brightening lines of light, she wasn't slowing down anymore. Millions must be dead already.
Capitals now, glowing brighter. Washington, Tokyo, Beijing, Moscow, New Delhi, Cairo, Rome, Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, London, and all the rest. Soon every government on Earth was obliterated.
There was a pause, and he thought she might stop there. Then the rest of the big cities started to go.
‘They don't deserve to be on the same world as you.' New York, Mumbai, São Paulo.
'They never have.' Osaka, Shanghai, Hong Kong.
'Any of them.' Guangzhou, Calcutta, Los Angeles.
'Show them.' Istanbul, Saint Petersburg, Chicago.
Doc watched as Flicker carried out his last request.
It wasn't until she had finished her grid sweep of Europe, leaving the whole continent glowing, and started on Africa, that Doc realized she wasn't going to stop. Not until the people were gone. All of them. Some other life might survive, but no humans would, she would make sure of that, before she finally let go. Faithful to the end, and beyond. He felt a distant horror at his failures, shame at his weakness, but as sight finally went dark, all he could feel for his daughter was love and pride.
*****
Doc jackknifed forward, then twisted as the bile rose, and vomited into the basin that was always beside him in bed now. He dry heaved for a while, shaking. When he was finally done, he rinsed and spat, then looked at the bedside display. Three minutes REM sleep total this time. It always seemed longer. He could probably go a week before he had to try again.
He checked the defense display - everything was green, as usual, then moved to the sensory test unit. After running the tests, he relaxed minutely. He was back in reality. Probably.
He picked up the hand comp, and opened up the nightmare section of his secure personal database. Okay, cross lucid dreaming attempt after secondary cognitive structure building off the list, it hadn't worked any better than anything else. Next time would be another control, no amelioration, just to make sure the baseline effects hadn't changed. He recorded the data in his custom form, ticking the boxes labeled 'Human extinction', 'Block failure', and 'Flicker' under eschatology.
Doc finally finished and set the hand comp down again. He shook his head to clear it, then got up, a little unsteadily, and stumbled toward the shower. It could have been worse, he reflected, as the water washed away his sour sweat. At least it hadn't been one of the bad ones.

Google might not be ready to talk about any work it's potentially doing with room-scale tracking for mobile VR just yet, but the team at Dacuda is.
This mobile scanning company has this week launched a new video (below) showcasing its SLAM Scan 3D engine technology being used to enable real world movement within smartphone-based VR experiences. Using the regular camera built into the smartphone, the user has 6 degrees of movement in a full 360 degree area, much like you'd see with the HTC Vive, though without the area limitations. This is demonstrated with the help of an iPhone 6 and the Zeiss VR One headset, which a user puts on and then walks around a virtual environment as if they were really there. You could feasibly do this with just about any modern smartphone and a mobile HMD, though.
It's impressive stuff; the user leans and crouches around the area to demonstrate positional tracking, and even connects to a PC via USB to play SteamVR games on mobile with tracking remaining intact. The example used in the video is Wevr's theBlu, and it seems to hold up pretty well. Of course, there aren't any motion controls to allow users to bring their hands into the experience, but it's not hard to imagine some third party devices delivering on this. Perhaps even Google's Daydream controller could fill that role someday.
According to the company, SLAM Scan is already incorporated in over a million smart devices. That's a whole lot of phones that could already be capable of Room Scale mobile VR.
Interestingly, Room Scale functionality was not a part of yesterday's reveal of Google Daydream, a new platform for mobile VR experiences. Given the company is working on its own 3D environment scanning with Project Tango, the capability is more than likely there. Perhaps the company is just realistic about the space requirements for VR and the potential dangers of obscuring your real world vision and asking you to walk around. Or perhaps this is something that it's saving talking about for another time.
Either way, this is proof that Room Scale mobile VR can happen. It's just a case of when.

The Conservative government is using inaccurate and outdated wage information to set pay rates under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program and could be driving down wages for Canadians, according to a Tyee analysis of data obtained by the Alberta Federation of Labour.
Foreign Temp Worker Approvals Plummet read more
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
Employers have to show they are prepared to pay the going rate for a job before they are allowed to bring in temporary workers from other countries. The rules are intended to ensure employers can only bring in foreign workers once they've shown efforts were made to hire Canadians at prevailing wages.
But as recently as last year the government was using seven-year-old wage data to assess employers' claims that they were prepared to pay the prevailing rate in some sectors.
The government says it's now gathering wage data from employers' listings on its Job Bank website.
But the labour federation says employers can easily manipulate the listings to keep wages low for temporary foreign workers. That in turn drives down pay for Canadian workers, the labour group says.
The federation submitted Access to Information request for the federal government's list of prevailing wages for a variety of trades 16 months ago and only recently received the information.
The sources for the wage rates varied. Some were based on Employment Insurance statistics and labour force surveys. Others were provided with no indication of how they were determined.
Seven-year-old data used
At least until April 2014, the government relied on seven-year-old data to set prevailing wages in some regions. The Temporary Foreign Worker Program wage standard for carpenters in Windsor-Sarnia was based on the 2007 rate of $17.30 an hour. The federal government's own fair wage rate for a carpenter on a federal job in that region in 2011 was $27.80 hourly.
The system is broken and easily abused, said Siobhan Vipond, the labour federation's acting president.
"It's such a bad model," Vipond said. "The government of Canada is not collecting good information, so we have to rely on this completely employer-driven ad bank to determine the prevailing wage."
The Employment and Social Development department Job Bank lets employers list job opportunities on a government website.
Critics argue it's easy for employers to post jobs at low wages to manipulate the system. There is no guarantee jobs were filled at that rate, or that candidates didn't negotiate better pay before accepting a position.
An Alberta wage and salary survey found the prevailing wage for a carpenter is $31.23 an hour. But advertisements on the Job Bank were mostly offering between $28 and $30 per hour. If employers win approval to bring temporary workers at the lower rate, they save $2,300 to $6,000 a year per employee.
The approach opens the system to employer abuse, says Vipond. "They have all the power in that situation to post the job at whatever rate, claim that they didn't get anybody, and then bring someone in at a prevailing rate that is based on that job advertisement," she said.
Vipond said the ATIP response showed that in many cases the federal government's figures for "prevailing wages" fell or failed to keep up with the cost of living.
The federal government's "prevailing wage" for plumbers in northeastern B.C. dropped 68 cents from 2011 to 2012, for example, and the $24-per-hour standard was not increased until at least March 2014.
In Alberta, the federal government's prevailing wage standard for a carpenter plummeted (see page nine) from $34.57 an hour in 2005 to $26.50 in 2012.
That's the same period when employers were allowed to bring in more temporary foreign workers. The number of temporary workers in Canada climbed from about 100,000 in 2002 to roughly 400,000 in 2012.
Approach prevents wage undercutting: ministry
Vipond said the Temporary Foreign Worker Program and the International Mobility Program, which has even fewer safeguards to stop employer abuse, are contributing to wage stagnation.
"We feel like the immigration system in this country needs to be fixed," Vipond said. "We need to stop bringing people in as workers and bring them in as potential citizens."
An Employment and Social Development communications staffer said in an email that when no regional wage information is available on the Job Bank website, provincial or national rates could be used.
The program's approach prevents employers from undercutting wages, the statement said.

Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed new rules to crack down on pervasive health care discrimination against transgender men and women. The draft rules address forms of discrimination that were banned years ago on paper but remain a constant feature in many transgender individuals' dealings with doctors and insurance companies—from being refused basic services such as blood tests to not being reimbursed for health care screenings such as Pap smears or prostate exams.
If approved, the rules would force much health care providers and insurers across the country to provide transgender patients with the same medical treatments and level of care they provide to nontransgender people—parity that most insurers never even approach.
In a recent survey of transgender men and women by the National Center for Transgender Equality and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 19 percent of people polled reported that someone refused them medical care because of their gender identity. Twenty-eight percent had postponed medical care because of discrimination, and half reported that they had to explain transgender health issues to their own doctors. These practices have contributed to disproportionately negative health outcomes for transgender people compared with the general population, such as staggering rates of depression, suicide, and HIV.
A series of actions at the federal level to end such discrimination did little to change the reality for most transgender patients. When it passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act included a provision that explicitly barred many providers from sex discrimination. In 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services clarified that sex discrimination included discrimination against transgender patients on the basis of gender identity. A federal court in Minnesota backed up that interpretation in March this year, giving transgender people the ability to sue. But states still have broad authority to determine what actually constitutes discrimination—leaving a substantial loophole when it comes to enforcing protections.
The rules proposed last Thursday do not compel insurers to cover the medical components of the transition process, such as hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery. But Mara Keisling, the founder and director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, stresses that health care discrimination goes far beyond transition treatments. It can be as simple as “access to hospital rooms,” says Keisling. “Being placed with a roommate of the wrong sex.” Transgender patients have reported being forced to undergo a pelvic exam when going to the doctor for a sore throat or being grilled at length about their gender identity and sexual history when seeking treatment for a broken arm. Keisling adds that insurance companies routinely refuse transgender men and women sex-specific preventive care—such as mammograms or prostate exams. These rules would force insurers to cover whatever preventive services a doctor finds necessary, regardless of what gender is listed in the patient's medical history.
Thirty-seven-year-old Seth Marlow's medical history reads like a catalog of such abuses. Marlow works in health care IT and is well connected in transgender advocacy circles. But even he has struggled to get basic medical care. At one point, Marlow says, he was unable to have routine blood work done because a doctor he visited said his Christian faith prevented him from treating Marlow. His previous insurance company refused to pay for a fertility clinic to extract and freeze his eggs—which was one of the insurer's covered benefits—seemingly because he identified as a man.
“As much as there's this great transgender tipping point,” Marlow says. “I still can't get health care.”
Part of his problems stem from the fact that until this year, the Obama administration did not define what discrimination specifically means. That definition was originally left up to the states, and only a handful have applied the protections in the Affordable Care Act to transgender people.
Marlow now lives in Virginia, a state that has not enacted any of these protections. The health care plan he purchased on the Obamacare exchanges routinely denies him coverage for hormone therapy, even though the insurer covers the same hormone treatments for other, nontransgender patients. More recently, Marlow's insurer refused to cover his annual pelvic exam and pap smear. In a September letter that Marlow shared with Mother Jones, his insurer suggested he contact his state legislator if he was unhappy with Virginia law.
“I've spent probably 10 years of my life fighting these exclusions,” he says. “On paper, I'm protected. But in practice, I'm getting blown off and shut down at every turn.”
Most civil rights advocates point out that these actions by insurance companies are already illegal under the Affordable Care Act, and when such cases go to court, they are usually settled in favor of transgender litigants. But legal action is time-consuming, costly, and undertaken when there are no other options. “After they announced the rule, I went to our Facebook page,” Keisling says. “And person after person was saying, well that's great, but I doubt it will help me.”
Marlow is also skeptical that the proposed rules will reduce health care discrimination, given that many rules were already in place and not enforced. “I'm so jaded and so tired that it's hard to believe this is going to make any difference,” Marlow continues. “There's a little progress. But it's painfully, gruelingly slow.”
A man accused of imprisoning eight women in a Sandy Springs mansion and forcing them to work as strippers saw most of the charges against him dropped at a March 23 court hearing.
Kenndric Roberts, 33, had multiple counts of human trafficking and several other charges against him dropped, according to Mike Maloof Jr., an attorney at the firm representing him. Roberts still faces two charges of false imprisonment and one charge of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, Maloof said, and likely will be released soon on an $80,000 bond.
Roberts was arrested by the police and the FBI on March 7 after a woman made a 911 call from 100 Strauss Lane, a rented mansion at the Nesbitt Ferry Road intersection in northern Sandy Springs, saying she was being held against her will. Authorities accuse Roberts of forcing several women to live there and give him the money they made at such strip clubs as Brookhaven's Pink Pony.
Maloof said that Roberts contends he was running a business and the women were voluntary workers.
“Evidence was shown in court that this was a business and contracts were signed by the women and everyone was free to go at any time,” Maloof said. “There was more to it than, I think, what has been reported in the media.”
It is possible that, if the case goes to a grand jury, Roberts could be indicted for human trafficking or other charges, Maloof said. But a Fulton County Superior Court judge found insufficient evidence to charge him with that crime at this time, Maloof said.

The 10 most egregious misquotes, blurb whores, and other movie-ad sins of 2007.
The critic blurb is a staple of arts advertising. Yet if you look behind some blurbs, you'll find quotes out of context, quote whores, and other questionable ad practices. Blurb Racket exposes the truth behind critics blurbs in movie ads from the New York Times.
For the first time, Gelf is unveiling its favorite blurbs of the year. Each one exemplifies a deceptive practice that is near the top of the blurb writer's toolbox. Don't like a review? Rearrange it, or cut out the negativity, or change a word entirely. Or even better, find a non-critic associated with a reputable publication who raved, and use that.
Movie titles link to metacritic.com, which compiles movie reviews in a far-more honest way than do movie ads. See the inaugural Blurb Racket column for background and useful links, and find out what critics think of the racket here.
Image caption Former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Sean FitzPatrick has been arrested at Dublin airport
The former head of Anglo Irish Bank, Sean FitzPatrick, has been arrested by Irish police in connection with alleged financial irregularities at the bank.
Mr FitzPatrick has been appearing in court in Dublin.
He is the third former senior executive from Anglo Irish Bank to appear in court within the past 24 hours.
All three men face 16 charges in relation to an alleged failed attempt to prop up Anglo's share price after a stock market collapse.
Anglo was nationalised at a cost of about 30bn euros (£23.4bn) to Irish taxpayers.
Airport arrest
Mr FitzPatrick served as chief executive and then chairman of the bank, building it up to become what at one time appeared to be one of the biggest success stories of Ireland's boom years.
However, Anglo was badly exposed by the bursting of the Irish property bubble and suffered the largest corporate loss in the history of the Republic of Ireland.
Mr FitzPatrick stepped down from his position in December 2008, a month before Anglo had to be bailed out by the state.
Irish police arrested him at about 05:35 BST on Tuesday at Dublin airport and took him to Bridewell Garda station in the city centre.
It is the third time Mr FitzPatrick has been arrested as part of the three-and-a-half year long investigation into the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank.
On Monday, Willie McAteer - the second in command at the bank before his resignation in January 2009 - appeared in court alongside Pat Whelan, a former head of lending and operations at the bank.
Mr McAteer, 60, from Rathgar in Dublin, was granted bail until 8 October but was was ordered to hand in his passport.
Mr Whelan, 50, from Malahide in County Dublin, was also granted bail but was ordered to give 48 hours notice if he is travelling anywhere outside Ireland or the UK.
The former bank is being wound down and is currently being run by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (IBRC).

A celebration of the NBA's most infuriating players, both past and present. Read other NBA Shit List entries here.
In April 1996, Antoine Walker appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the first and presumably last time. The image of the airborne Kentucky sophomore—biceps flexed, legs split wide like a tripod's—would've made for a hell of a Fathead. It was also the perfect representation of the kind of pro the 6-8 forward should've been. When the Celtics traded up to take 'Toine with the sixth pick in that June's draft, my 13-year-old self assumed they'd be getting the same player I saw on the cover of SI. And for a little while, he was that player.

On Halloween in 1997, I watched him score 31 points in a season-opening win over the dynastic Bulls. Walker was both efficient (he shot 13 of 26 from the floor) and refreshingly insufferable. "You should have seen the look on Walker's face," wrote Michael Holley, at the time the Boston Globe's Celtics beat writer. "It was a sneer. He did his dance, a shoulder-shaker called the BK Bounce, and did chest bumps with everyone who came his way."
It's sad that that particular game, the first in the Rick Pitino era, was likely the high point of the coach's tenure in Boston. It's doubly sad that it was also—considering the competition—possibly the most impressive individual performance of 'Toine's career. Walker was barely in his second year in the NBA then, but instead of going on to blossom into a superstar, he spent the next decade regressing. His resume, which includes his signature shimmy, a 49-point game, multiple buzzer beaters, three All-star appearances, and a championship (with Miami in 2006), is sparkling to the naked eye, but ultimately feels hollow. That's why Walker was so head-bangingly frustrating. He entered the league with a startling amount of offensive skill, but devolved into a chubby chucker, one who devoted his pro career to exploring the upper and lower bounds of the break-even point for long-range shooting. As a friend put it: 'Toine was forever the tall, pudgy yet talented middle schooler who'd make his way past five flailing defenders before throwing up an off-balance 25-footer.
The man didn't just like to let it fly. Had it been possible, Antoine Walker would've fucked the three-point line. He led the league in attempts from beyond the arc for three straight seasons beginning in 2000-01, yet in that stretch, he never finished better than 53rd in three-point field goal percentage. (In 2001-02 alone, he heaved up 645 treys, the third-highest total in NBA history. Ray Allen, that season's second-place finisher, took 528.) His jumper was never particularly pretty to look at—he pinched his knees together before lifting off—and he became the fans' ultimate "NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! YES!" shooter. But after a few seasons, and after seeing him take too many bad shots, I found that I wasn't tacking on the "YES!" much anymore.

Walker's shot selection wasn't always the most maddening thing about him. In July 1998, after failing to show up to Pitino's summer sessions, he sounded off to Holley with the still-infamous line, "Let me tell you, no veteran, All-Star player shows up for a camp like that. For the rest of my career, I'll never go to a camp like that. Never." Here we had a one-time All-Star with two seasons under his belt referring to himself as a "veteran, All-Star player," and that wasn't even the most ridiculous thing about the interview. At one point, Walker declared himself "the most loved player in the NBA." Holley also mentions that 'Toine wished the Celtics had drafted his college teammate Nazr Mohammed instead of Paul Pierce. "Pierce is a good player," Walker said. "He's a guy who can come off the bench and give scoring to our second unit. But I know our team needs. We need big people."

Holley's story moved the Globe's Bob Ryan to pen what in hindsight appears to be his version of a Deadspin NBA Shit List column, but without the nuance and underlying love you've surely come to find here. Ryan went full paternal in his takedown, to an uncomfortable degree. He calls Walker "a punk," "an arrogant, misguided, yes, punk"; "a snotty punk who has no idea what it takes to win a championship at this level"; "one of those great jokes of nature"; and "an AAU baby who has never worked at anything other than basketball in his life." Ryan also advises Boston against signing Walker to a long-term contract, because "he will immediately take it as a validation of his greatness. He feels no need for improvement." Beneath the smarmy bluster, Ryan does offer a smidgen of constructive criticism, scolding 'Toine for leading the league in turnovers, for his "atrocious shot selection," and for being "an erratic defensive player, as befits a soon-to-be-22-year-old."
Walker got his big contract in 1999, but he never turned into a steady defensive player. In fact, his inability to slow New Jersey's Kenyon Martin in back-to-back postseason series in 2002 and 2003 contributed to truncated playoff runs. By then, 'Toine had already begun to look slower and puffier. He was only in his late 20s, and he could barely jump. I remember scalping a ticket and spending most of the decisive Game 6 of the '02 Eastern Conference finals angry at Walker. That afternoon, he managed to shoot 1 of 9 from three-point range. On the way out of the Fleet Center, my cousin got drilled with a half-full beer cup.
Soon, the Celtics had had enough, too. Boston actually traded Walker twice: First to Dallas in 2003, then, after a brief return to Massachusetts in 2005, to Miami. I didn't think much about 'Toine for the next few years—at least until last March, when he once again appeared in the pages of Sports Illustrated. This time, Walker was prominently featured not on the front of the magazine but in the back pages. That, as you probably know, is where the emotionally heavy stuff goes. Chris Ballard's well-told story explained how the generous but irresponsible Walker went broke. It was a depressing read.

At the time, 'Toine, who's since announced his retirement from basketball, was playing for the D-League's Idaho Stampede. One of the accompanying portraits, of Walker alone inside the locker room, made me sad. The sky-walking SI cover boy from '96 was gone. In his place was a chubby 35-year-old gunner staring off into space, everything still and quiet and as cold as the ice on his knee, nothing moving, nothing shimmying.

An increase in US wood pellet exports intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels may be threatening ecologically important forests across the country, according to a new report from the Natural Resources Defense Council
European Union (EU) rules intended to reduce power plant reliance on fossil fuels are threatening significant areas of ecologically important hardwood forests across the southeastern US, and will do little to mitigate carbon emissions, according to a new report.
The report, produced by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in collaboration with the Conservation Biology Institute, detailed a 150% increase in wood pellet exports (pdf) from the US during the past three years. Most are bound for Europe, where power companies are replacing coal and other fossil fuels with wood-based biofuels in order to benefit from EU incentives on renewable energy sources.
Debbie Hammel, senior resource specialist for NRDC's Land and Wildlife Program, said that the EU has few safeguards to ensure that wood pellet biofuel comes from plantation-grown trees and wood remnants, rather than wood harvested from mature forests. That calls into serious question EU claims of carbon-neutral biomass fuels, she said.
“When you burn wood pellets you are immediately and instantaneously releasing carbon into the atmosphere,” said Hammel. “And there's very little certainty that those forests will continue to grow over the long term.”
The report detailed geographic information system mapping (GIS) conducted in bottomland hardwood forests and wetlands in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and southeastern Georgia – areas that have experienced rapid expansion of wood pellet manufacturing since 2012. It identified parts of Louisiana as another emerging zone of concern.
The report warned that 24m acres of unprotected forest lands across the southeastern US are at risk, largely from European biomass operations. It predicts that wood pellet manufacturing throughout the region could increase twelve-fold by 2020.
As new pellet mills come online, the report said, the areas they target for wood harvesting are likely to overlap with those of existing mills, creating what the report referred to as wood sourcing hotspots and intensifying potential ecosystem damage.
Southeastern forests in the US have long been under threat from urban sprawl, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries. Today, they are also increasingly under threat from rising sea levels. With the rise of the wood pellet industry, the risks to these ecosystems, which include hundreds of endangered, imperiled and threatened species, could escalate dramatically, warned James Strittholt, president of the Conservation Biology Institute.
“It makes perfect sense that we work toward a non-fossil fuel energy source – no argument there – but the issue is the alternatives we pick are not always benign and we need to be thoughtful about that,” Strittholt said. “Just because it's trees and not fossil fuel, it shouldn't be everything goes, because everything will indeed go if there aren't some kinds of controls.”
Strittholt observed that development of new wood pellet facilities is moving much faster than regulators can respond. He noted that some of the forest lands identified just last year in the mapping project as future harvest sites have already been affected.
“From the looks of the data we're seeing … there's an economic opportunity, there's a market, so the corporate response can be quite rapid compared with any safeguarding mechanisms already in place,” he said.
Pellet manufacturer Enviva and British utility Drax Power are leaders in the region's expanding biomass industry. In an email, Enviva's vice president of communications, Kent Jenkins Jr, countered some of the report findings. He said the majority of wood used by Enviva's production plants in Virginia and North Carolina comes from upland forest and mixed stands rather than mature bottomland hardwood.
“Regardless of the source, we use only leftover and low-grade wood that undergoes a rigorous sustainability assessment, certified by independent third parties,” Jenkins said.
Going deforestation-free: can it protect our forests? Read more
Hammel dismissed wood pellet makers' sustainability standards as “extraordinarily insufficient”. She said companies need to be more transparent about the source of wood used in their products and decrease reliance on mature forests that might take hundreds of years to regrow, thereby undermining any potential emission mitigation.
The NRDC is urging the EU to enact more stringent standards for biomass carbon accounting. The organization is also asking the EU to cap the amount of biofuel permitted in power generation so the demand doesn't outstrip the supply of actual low-carbon biomass like sawdust and remnant wood.
“These forests are our best defense against climate change,” Hammel said. “They soak up carbon and provide habitat for critically endangered species. EU policymakers need to do the right thing and protect forests and climate.”
Yesterday I was on a private Facebook group, and we were discussing this “fantasy of impeachment” from lefty pundit Sally Kohn:
Straightforward from here: 1. Impeach Trump & Pence 2. Constitutional crisis 3. Call special election 4. Ryan v Clinton 5. President Clinton — Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) February 15, 2017
There it is. The snowflake's delusion. Impeach Trump and Pence, get Hillary and Ryan to run against each other, ?????????, President Clinton.
This admittedly enchanting illusion ignores the fact that you can't impeach two people at once and that, even if you managed to impeach both Trump and Pence, Ryan would simply become president without any runoff, and in fact, that if you impeached Ryan too, there would be a line of succession to go on. It also ignores the fact that, on any given day, given a head start of ten points (or more; they DID go all out) of media favoritism, Hillary couldn't beat a syphilitic camel. It, in fact, ignores the fact that “that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.”
But, more importantly to me, those who are scheming and trying to “Nixon” Trump are missing an important and distinguishing factor between the two Republican presidents (perhaps because all Republicans look alike to them).
That important distinguishing factor is as follows: Trump is not Nixon.
I know, I just blew your mind, right?
Admittedly, I'm not a student of Nixon, but I've read a bio or two, as well as references to him in fiction of the time. Also, my friend who lived through the impeachment gave me some perspective on the whole thing when Clinton was in the process of being impeached. (I lived through the Nixon impeachment too, but I was in Portugal, and young, of which the greatest handicap was the first. If you think our media is leftist -- and it is -- you must understand European media make it look like Drudge or Breitbart.) My friend said that Clinton wouldn't step down because he didn't have Nixon's personality. When things turned sour -- according to this friend, and not contradicted by what I've read -- Nixon went paranoid and closed up, creating a sort of “fortress White House” and making the cover-up far worse than the crime.
Billy Jeff, on the other hand, smirked through his impeachment, mealy-mouthed the meaning of “is” and continued being president after what should have been a death blow, because … well, because he had no principles or shame or anything to prevent him from continuing to exert power.
Which brings us to Trump.
I don't need to tell people here that I was against Trump before I was for him. In fact, I only decided to vote for him the week before the election, and only because knowing what I did about Hillary, I thought it was likely that a Hillary win would be a boulder rolled over the grave of the republic. (And everyone who's been to Boulder knows how hard it is for anyone, even someone wrongly buried, to dig through that many hippies to get out.)
HP releases Android on TouchPad code to happy hackers
If you follow the tablet market closely, you'll be familiar with HP TouchPad that launched packing webOS and met a quick demise when sales were not good, and the tablet received some poor review scores. Some will also recall that during the TouchPad blowout sale, a few of the tablets allegedly shipped and were running Android out-of-the-box. The version of Android that those tablets were running has now been gifted from HP to the open-source geeks of the world.
HP never did figure out how exactly those tablets shipped with Android pre-installed. The tablets shipping with Android created a stir because companies that ship Android devices are required to make the kernel open source. Since HP didn't officially release the tablets running Android, it was not required to make the kernel of its internal build open-source. However, HP has now offered that internal Android build to the open-source movement.
In essence, releasing the Android kernel is a goodwill gesture on HP's part since it wasn't required. I would imagine many of the TouchPads on the market today will be running Android, and the launch of this kernel makes it much easier. Some that have fiddled around with the HP Android kernel are pointing out that it appears the kernel was developed separately from webOS. The last change in the code was made in March of 2011; three months before the tablet launched.

No group is more solidly Republican than white men.* While the long-term trend is that the nation is growing more racially diverse -- and, in particular, seeing an increased percentage of the population that is Hispanic -- it's a slow evolution. As we noted in September when President Obama postponed action on immigration reform, the midterm electorate is significantly whiter (and less Hispanic) than in presidential elections. Meaning that an already friendly 2014 midterm will see an electorate built on top of the Republican base.
Below is a comparison of turnout percentages by race among the voting-age population, according to the Census Bureau. Watch how white turnout changes between general elections and midterms -- particularly compared to other racial groups. (The groups represented below are white non-Hispanic and black non-Hispanic voters.)
But note this in particular: White turnout in midterms matches Hispanic turnout in presidential elections. That's significant. Even if there were an equal number of white and Hispanic voters in the country, more whites would cast votes.
But there aren't an equal number of whites and Hispanics in the country. Using Census data on the size of the citizen voting age population, here's an estimate of the actual composition of the vote among the four groups isolated above. Since that leaves out voters, we've included the Roper Center's estimated breakdown of the 2012 vote for comparison.
The point being: White voters comprise the majority of the electorate in any year but a larger majority of it in midterms -- by a sizable amount.
Even gender plays to the Republicans' favor today. Over time, women have passed men in turnout. But the gap between the two is much smaller in midterm elections.
Past behavior doesn't dictate what happens in the future, of course. But 2014 will likely be as good an electorate as the Republican Party could hope for -- and perhaps as good an electorate as it will ever see again.
* In the most recent Post / ABC News poll, male likely voters preferred Republican House candidates by a 56/39 margin, versus 49/44 preference for Democrats among women. White voters preferred Republicans 59/35, versus 74/21 Democratic preference among non-whites.
The spending controversy is linked to the Tories' 'battle bus' in the 2015 general election
Pressure is building on senior Conservatives over their election expenses after leaked emails revealed furious infighting over who is to blame.
Those who masterminded the 2015 campaign are facing questions, after MPs said they felt cast adrift by party officials "covering their own backsides".
Two dozen Tories are understood to be under police investigation over claims they overspent on their local campaigns in which spending limits are tight.
Karl McCartney, MP for Lincoln and one of those under investigation, wrote a bombshell email to the party chairman attacking the party's handling of the controversy linked to its election "battle bus".
In it, he wrote: "We didn't create this mess, the clever dicks at CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters) did, and I don't see their professional reputations being trashed in the media."
Sky News can reveal:
:: An email sent to 30 Tory MPs claims the party has withheld a draft report it has already received from the Electoral Commission into the issue.
:: A second email to the party chairman claims Conservative Central Office was to blame for the expenses "mess".
:: The MPs held a showdown meeting with party chairman Patrick McLoughlin on Tuesday afternoon to air their concerns.
:: MPs implicated in the row said they felt "scared" about the outcome of the investigations and believe Downing St is worried.
Image: Karl McCartney, MP for Lincoln, is one of the Tory politicians under investigation
The spending row centres on the Tories' use of an election battle bus to campaign in key seats, and whether spending on hotels and campaign material was incorrectly registered as national spending, which has much higher limits than local spending.
Meanwhile, Kent Police refused to confirm reports Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, who defeated ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage in Thanet South, was questioned under caution last Friday over his expenses.
If Conservatives are found to have committed any offence, their political opponents could ask for the contests to be rerun.
Mr McCartney, a justice of the peace who was elected in 2010 and fought off a challenge from Labour in 2015, is said to be acting as an informal "shop steward" to the group of mainly newly elected MPs implicated.
He wrote to colleagues last week saying Conservative Central Office (CCHQ) had received a draft report from the Electoral Commission, which has been investigating party spending for a year.
Image: Craig Mackinlay has reportedly been questioned by police under caution
Mr McCartney said this information came from a Conservative Party-appointed solicitor who is acting for the group, but claimed the contents of the report had not been shared with MPs.
However, a Conservative source denied officials had received the report.
Mr McCartney wrote: "I have made my disquiet and disbelief at this course of action pretty clear in a blunt email to the party chairman and the whips office overnight."
In that email, also seen by Sky News, and addressed to Mr McLoughlin who is in the cabinet, he wrote that his colleagues "feel completely cast adrift by CCHQ/whips/the parliamentary party and left to fend for themselves".
He added: "At what stage do you think you (the Party) might inform us that another media s***storm is coming? We didn't create this mess, the clever dicks at CCHQ did, and I don't see their professional reputations being trashed in the media much.
"The initial cock-ups, 'strategy' and ineptitude with regard to this issue that has so negatively impacted our: lives, standing in our communities, standing amongst colleagues, families and our regard for particular parts of the Party centrally, and were all of CCHQ's making…need to stop.
"We are the ones who are now (and since the beginning as individuals have been) in the media spotlight and it might have been a little more reassuring and collegiate if the powers that be in our party perhaps tried to be a little bit more supportive and less interested in covering their own backsides."
Image: The MPs have held a showdown meeting with party chairman Patrick McLoughlin
Mr McCartney asks why MPs were not warned about the Electoral Commission report, expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
He said none of the MPs have been questioned by the Commission and asked: "Who else has had a copy? And what are the ramifications of its current version and what if it accepts your feedback and rewrites whole swathes of their draft?"
He asked the party chairman for guidance on dealing with media inquiries, saying: "We do need a press release for national and local media interest. I would rather sing from the same hymn sheet."
On his website, he wrote: "The Conservative Party advised us that the so-called campaign 'battle buses' were, as at previous general elections and in keeping with the practice of both the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats, a national campaign expense.
"This meant that they were not to be declared in our own election expenses....It is unfortunate that private internal emails sent to a small number of cross-referenced recipients has somehow wended its way into the hands of the media."
Another of the MPs in the group, elected in 2015, and under police investigation said they firmly believed the spending was correctly registered.
The MP said: "People are scared, this has been hanging over us for more than a year. I absolutely believe it was legitimately national spending in my case.
"Our solicitor which they have paid for agrees that the law is what it is and we haven't broken it. But I think CCHQ have been quite complacent about how far it would go. No 10 is now very concerned about it."
A Conservative spokesman said: "We are cooperating with the ongoing investigations."

The secret spiritual home of the Church of Scientology can now be seen for the first time every in photos exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com.
The ranch sits in Ceston, a remote area of San Luis Obispo County, California, and has been dubbed the 'Scientology Graceland', or the 'Garden of Eden'.
It is the last resting place of founder L Ron Hubbard, and has been kept in pristine condition nearly 30 years after his death, held in the highest regard by the church and its followers.
The property has been shrouded in secrecy for decades, and it is unknown what now goes on at the estate, but DailyMail.com has the exclusive first photos of the compound.
Some believe that celebrity Scientologists such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta use it as a retreat and will return there full-time when it's the 'end of the world'.
But the 'end of the world' described by Hubbard may never come to pass. In a shocking interview Hubbard's devoted servant claimed that Hubbard admitted on his death bed that the religion was 'a monster he couldn't control' and was was sorry for ever creating it.

The property features a running circle (top right), which is infamous in Scientology. The circles are allegedly used as punishment for anyone who commits supposed offences against the church
The main house in the center of the estate took four years to build and was to be used as Hubbard's main residence and office
The property was preserved after Hubbard's death and has been shrouded in secrecy for decades. It is unknown what now goes on at the estate
He was tired of being chased by the FBI and IRS for unpaid taxes and accusations infiltration, wiretapping and theft of government documents, according to servant Steve 'Sarge' Pfauth.
Pfauth, who died in July, was a member of the Church's Sea Org and worked under Hubbard for four years until the church leader's own death in January 1986.
Pfauth told DailyMail.com he was with Hubbard during his final days when he was dying of pancreatitis and suffered a fatal stroke.
The assistant said he signed the death certificate and Last Will, and was there for one of Hubbard's final conversations in which he bitterly regretted ever having set it up.
For years, Hubbard had been on the run from the FBI and IRS, who were chasing him for millions in unpaid taxes.
Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard died in 1986 following a stroke
He was also besieged by lawsuits from companies that the Church had fought in the 1960s and 70s.
Before his July death, Pfauth told DailyMail.com that Hubbard felt guilty about duping thousands into believing the religion that he made up.
He said: 'LRH told me that he had failed. He wanted to leave his body, he was going to go somewhere else, it was all over here. He said: "I'm going to drop my body, I just want to get out of here." He just said he failed. The founder of Scientology just wanted to leave Scientology.
'He told me he wasn't coming back to Scientology - "I don't want to do it anymore". This was on his deathbed. Scientology became this monster that he couldn't control, he regretted ever creating the thing.
'He was very unhappy about not being able to run Scientology because he was on the run and had these lawsuits.
'He wasn't supposed to have contact with anyone, he was taken pretty much off it, he'd lost control, and he knew it. He didn't care about it anymore.'
Responding to DailyMail.com's request for comment, media relations representative Karin Pouw said, 'Oh, please. Steve Pfauth was a drunk handyman and was not a credible source.'
Hubbard chose Creston because it was away from prying eyes in the middle of California's ranch country.
To blend in, his dedicated team of followers pretended they were horse racers and farmers.
As our exclusive images show, they had a ready made racecourse and stables, but typically they put a Scientology touch to it.
The 160-acre site was made into a fortress and Scientology symbols put in the middle of the race course and on the gates.
Just before he died and said Hubbard (above) said bitterly regretted ever having set it up, his servant Steve 'Sarge' Pfauth told DailyMail.com
Those being 'punished' were allegedly forced walk round and round in the small circle for hours on end without food or water
The massive estate has a ready-made racecourse, stables and a zoo, despite the staff having no experience caring for animals
A watch tower made the perfect guard against any authorities trying to raid the place.
Meanwhile poorly paid staff from the Sea Org - the hardcore Church followers - would sleep with the animals, which were bought in by the hundreds to show that they were just regular farmers.
Some believe that celebrity Scientologists such as Tom Cruise uses it as a retreat and will return there full-time when it's the 'end of the world'
They also put in huge water cannons with fire fighting nozzles that could blast out 500 gallons per minute to ward off intruders.
There is also a running circle. Even though this one was meant for horses, a 'running circle' has been allegedly used in the past by Scientology as punishment for anyone who commits supposed offences - and they would be made to walk round and round in a circle for hours without food or water.
Scientologists are led to believe that Hubbard will return to Creston, which is owned by the Church of Spiritual Technology [CST], a separate umbrella especially created to preserve the Church's scriptures.
Former Scientology construction engineer Dylan Gill helped build other secret CST bases, and says: 'Creston is the Graceland, the Garden of Eden. That's where LRH is supposed to go when he returns.
'That's where he's supposed to be raised again and taken care of; the symbol [on the racecourse] is a way for a spirit to find its way back to where it belongs.
'Creston was always all over the top, extraordinary. If the end of the world did come, as Scientologists believe, all the celebrities and David Miscavige [current church leader] would be here.
'It's a beautiful property, no one can gain entry easily, it's a really sweet set up. Even Tom Cruise could make it his home.'
The horses were bought for the property as a pretense for all the neighboring farmers to actually believe they knew what they were doing
Mobile homes were constructed for contract workers, while staff members often slept with the animals on the property
Despite the property being in a dry, land-locked location in California, the estate still had a large pond and green grass
Steve ‘Sarge' Pfauth (left), who worked under Hubbard for four years until the founder's death in January 1986, said his owner regretted ever making up the Church. Hubbard's former chef and 'runner', Sinar Parman (right), says that everyone on site was so paranoid of the outside that they'd even bury their own vans
Hubbard's former chef and 'runner', Sinar Parman, worked on the Creston property for two years.
He says that everyone was so paranoid of the outside that they'd even bury their own vans - and he had to learn to scuba dive just in case someone was hiding in the lake.
'We used the vans for different things like to travel to HQ near Los Angeles. Instead of selling them, we buried them in the ground, that's how nuts it was,' he says.
'One day in '84, LRH told me I had to go buy wetsuits, tanks, regulators, buoyancy control devices, for practical dives in the lake - it was freezing. I still have no idea why, but you never know, they were so paranoid.'
A zoo and world class horses were brought in on Hubbard's lieutenant Pat Broeker's orders even though the only staff - Parman and Pfauth - had no animal experience.
The horses were there as a pretense for all the neighboring farmers to actually believe they knew what they were doing. They spent more than $1 million just on horses.
They also put in mobile homes for contract workers, which are still present today.
The main house in the center of the estate took four years to build and was to be used as Hubbard's main residence and office.
But, according to former members, he insisted on living in his Bluebird camper van.
'So there we were, we had a full on race track, jockey room, stables, world class horses, and we knew absolutely zero,' Parman says. 'We bought 40 horses and 10 Akita Japanese guard dogs, but then it got out of control. Both Pat and LRH were really paranoid, they started buying all sorts of animals.
Though there was a beautiful home on the property, Hubbard reportedly chose to sleep in a camper van on the site
The Scientology leader's massive property also featured symbols associated witht the church on gates and on the race course
'We had a chicken coop, turkeys, ducks, swans, geese, looms, all sorts of birds, buffalo, llamas and cows. I was in charge of them and the trees.
'We even got some thoroughbred show horses and put them into competitions to show that the Creston Ranch was the best horse farm in California. Crazy!'
Pfauth said he would be given hundreds of thousands of dollars from a safe in LRH's office, which he claims always had $2 million in it, for expenditures. He'd be given random instructions to buy animals, plants and even groceries with it.
Before his July death, he said: 'I put five years of hard work into that ranch, it was so rundown when we got it and it was a show place when he died.
'I spent $2.75 million on that ranch. The house had been remodeled to look like a Spanish villa, we spent hundreds of thousands just on the tiles for it.
'He went nuts and wanted a zoo, he kept coming back with all these animals. He just kept bringing more and more. He'd go to dog and horse shows, hobnob with big shots and spend millions.
'When LRH was alive, we got away with murder. We had money in the safe, we'd have maybe one, two million dollars in the safe, and I'd take it when I needed it.
'We'd always have plenty of cash. Ironically, we, the staff, made less than a dollar a day. I did all the shopping and purchasing, I'd fix all the meals, so if I felt lobster, I'd buy it, and nobody said boo about it.'
After LRH died in January 1986, David Miscavige preserved the Creston Ranch in honor of the Church's spiritual leader.
Ms. Pouw added that for credible information about Scientology and its Founder, L. Ron Hubbard, go to www.scientology.org.
The property also had huge water cannons with fire fighting nozzles that could blast out 500 gallons per minute to ward off intruders
A staff member said that he put five years into the ranch to fix it up, because it was 'run down' when the church bought it
Staff said they would be given hundreds of thousands from a safe in LRH's office, which he claims always had $2 million in it
The GeoServer team is happy to announce the release of GeoServer 2.3.1, now available for download.
This is the first bug-fix release of the 2.3.x stable series, and packs 34 changes between bug fixes and improvements in different departments. Here is an highlight:
The XSLT output format generator module graduated from community to official extension (work performed GeoSolutions Andrea Aime with sponsorship from the City of Vienna)
A couple of changes in the SQL Server data increase performance, provided you enable the relevant flags. One is the ability to transfer geometries in SQL Server native format, as opposed to using WKB, which avoids the slow WKB generation routines included in SQL Server, the other allows to disable native paging, which can sometimes lead the SQL Server query planner to create bad data access plans (GEOS-5750 and GEOS-5314). The native geometry serialization was sponsored by Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management and performed by Bouvet, thanks to Stewart Loving-Gibbard for the paging patch.
A new flag has been added to prevent the resolution of XML external entities (normally enabled by default in XML parsers), which can be used to prevent some kinds of XML attacks (GEOS-5273 and GEOS-5314). The work was performed by GeoSolution under sponsorship from the City of Vienna.
Some SLD related fixes (GEOS-4214, GEOS-5767) (thanks to GeoSolutions's Andrea and Carlo for those)
A bunch of improvements in the monitoring extension (GEOS-5725, GEOS-5732, GEOS-5758 and GEOS-5766) (thanks to OpenGeo's Justin Deoliveria and Ian Schneider for those, plus one from Andrea)
Fixed an issue that prevented GeoServer from serving back GetMap requests under Windows when using the JRE (GEOS-5768) (thanks goes to GeoSolutions' Simone for this one)
GWC will now respect the layer HTTP caching settings, and a memory leak has been fixed in respect to the WFS-T integration (GEOS-5686, GEOS-5659) (thanks' to OpenGeo's Ian Schneider for these)
The German translation maintainers fixed an encoding problem which resulted in weird chars appearing in the GeoServer UI (GEOS-5641) (thanks goes to Frank Gasdorf and Oskar Fonts for their continuous work on UI internationalization)
GeoServer UI is completely available in Dutch, German and Korean (thanks goes to Wouter van Nifterick, Frank Gasdorf, Stefan Engelhardt, Minpa Lee and others), feel free to review and contribute at Transifex.com
and (thanks goes to Wouter van Nifterick, Frank Gasdorf, Stefan Engelhardt, Minpa Lee and others), feel free to review and contribute at Transifex.com Finally, a few fixes and improvements in the security subsystem (GEOS-5698, GEOS-5751, GEOS-5753, GEOS-5783) (thanks to Christian Mueller for his continuous work on the security subsystem)
And there is more, you can find everything in the GeoServer release notes. Also, looking at the corresponding GeoTools 9.1 release notes we can find some extra goodies:
Improved support for sparse shapefiles (GEOT-2791) (thanks to Dieter DePaepe)
Added support for UUID data type in PostGis data stores (GEOT-4414) (thanks to Shane StClair)

The Supreme Court of the United States has blocked President Obama's plan to prevent around four million illegal immigrants from being deported if they have US born children and haven't got a criminal record.
It is heartbreaking for the millions of immigrants who made their lives here Barack Obama US President
Because the court was equally split in its vote a lower-court ruling from 2015 which invalidated Obama's plan will be left in place. He told reporters that the US immigration system has been broken for two decades and that the ruling will set it back even further.
“I think it is heartbreaking for the millions of immigrants who made their lives here, who've raised families here, who hope for the opportunity to work or pay taxes, serve in our military and fully contribute to this country we all love in an open way,” he said.
The ruling, coming seven months before Obama's term in office ends, is the latest success that the Republican party has had in thwarting a major policy initiative of the Democrat president.
Obama had hoped that overhauling the immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million illegal migrants in the US would be part of his presidential legacy.
The ruling is now likely to further amplify the role that the immigration issue will play in the presidential election campaign.
Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump had already called for all illegal immigrants to be deported and he's claimed that he will build a wall between Mexico and the US if he is elected on November 8.
A split ruling was possible because the court was down to eight justices, four liberals and four conservatives, after conservative justice Antonin Scalia died in February.
Two years after 5,000 Dalits converted to Buddhism in Junagadh in Gujarat, 90 Dalits embraced Buddhism at a programme organised by the Gujarat Buddhist Academy in Dholka town of Ahmedabad district on Thursday. The Dalits, who come from Ahmedabad's Jivraj Park area, include 27-year-old Bhamini Delwadia, an MBA, who belongs to the Scheduled Caste (SC).

Bhamini was joined by 89 other Dalits, including four of her family members, at the newly-built Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hall in Sonar Kui locality of Dholka, 30 km from Ahmedabad City.
The 90 Dalits, most of them between 20-35 years, took “diksha” from Bhikshu Pragnya Ratna, a Dhamma pracharak from The Great Ashoka Buddha Vihar in Porbandar, and general secretary of Gujarat region of Akhil Bharatiya Bhikshu Mahasangh. Bhikshu Pragnya Ratna was also joined by Bhikshu Padmasambhav from Surat and Bhikshu Pragnavansh from Madhya Pradesh as Buddhist religious leaders at the function attended by around 500 persons.
The conversion took place at a significantly simple function during which the 90 persons, including nine women, were given “diksha”, following which all present at the programme were showered with rose petals amid Buddhist prayers. Following the conversion, they gave a short speech in which they cited “inequality and unscientific and superstitious rituals” in Hinduism and their liking for Dr Ambedkar's ideals as the reasons for conversion.
“I believe in equality for all and do not find it in Hinduism. And I believe in the ideals of Dr Ambedkar, who himself converted to Buddhism while shedding Hinduism. So, following in his footsteps, we have adopted Buddhism today,” says Bhamini. Bhamini's IIM post-graduate husband Kunal and his parents — Abhilash and Hiraben — and brother Rahul also converted to Buddhism during the function.
Hemlata Sonara (20) from Dholka is among the nine women who converted to Buddhism. She is pursuing her Masters in Arts from HK Arts College in Ahmedabad. “Hinduism is full of superstitions. And the principles of independence and equality for all are lacking in it. Plus, I am attracted towards Buddhism since it is a religion entirely based on the scientific approach. Also, it gives a great emphasis on women's education,” Hemlata says.
Jatin Makwana (28), another convert, says, “I have learnt a lot from Buddhism. It's a religion full of equality which is in stark contrast to Hinduism. Being a Dalit, wherever you go, people ask for your caste and then discriminate against you. In Buddhism, there is no such hierarchy, all are equals.”
“So, it is better to follow a religion which practises equality than the one in which one gets humiliated on caste lines,” adds Jatin, who works as a lab assistant at a pathology laboratory in Dholka.
Nikita Parmar (26) from Rasikpura village of Ahmedabad is a housewife. She embraced Buddhism, along with her husband Arvind. Nikita converted because she did not like “blindly following Hindu rituals”. She said, “Also, these rituals have given birth to a lot of superstitions which are disgusting. I don't want to be a part of that religion.”

Secretary of Gujarat Buddhist Academy Ramesh Banker said, “We organised this programme as these 90 persons wanted to embrace Buddhism. Hinduism is full of superstitions where there is a system of caste-based hierarchy in which some people are considered untouchables. The programme was held in a peaceful manner.”
“It's much worse in middle-income countries than ever before,” said Dr. Maria Neira, director of the Department of Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health at the World Health Organization. “Fifty years ago, only a few cities had populations of more than two million. Today there are many.”
The highest numbers of deaths from outdoor air pollution are in China, India and Russia, according to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. That is in part because they have the most people. The countries with the highest mortality rates — deaths from air pollution per 100,000 total deaths — are in Eastern Europe: Bulgaria, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Latvia. The causes vary. Some believe it could be related to a legacy of dirty Soviet industry and fleets of aging diesel cars.
The key ingredient in policy change is a strong desire for it on the part of the population, said Christine L. Corton, the author of “London Fog”. In England, that happened in 1952, when another heavy smog episode — this time from coal-burning fireplaces and cooking ranges — left as many as 12,000 dead.
“In the end, it has to come down to the people wanting it,” she said.
Pollution seems like something that must have always provoked outrage, but in Britain that was not always the case. The famous London smog, etched into history by writers like Dickens and Impressionist painters such as Monet, Turner and Whistler, was once a symbol of prosperity, Dr. Corton said. It signified home fires burning (in Dickens there are grim references to meager fireplaces with just a few lumps of coal) and thrumming factories.
“The 1952 smog was a real knock to the psyche,” she said. “People had been through so much — the war, the Blitz. People said we didn't go through all those deprivations to die from coal smoke. They were fed up. They wanted a better quality of life.”
As for India, Professor Apte said he believed public opinion had shifted, and that there was a much broader recognition of air pollution as a problem. He hopes comprehensive health data from hospitals is collected from this recent episode. That could take the issue out of the realm of abstract statistics and make it real.
“We might be reaching a tipping point with this Delhi smog episode,” he said.
Professor Apte, who has been working in Delhi for the past eight years and was there this week, said he has done work showing that incremental declines in pollution levels in very polluted places do not bring big health improvements, a phenomenon that might make change hard at first. But there are big benefits to longer-term pollution control.

SERIAL killer Peter Tobin's niece is a twisted troll who threatened to slash a 12-year-old girl.
Jade Jackson, 20, spent four months bombarding the girl with messages.
She said it would be “cool” when the child “had blood pouring from her” in a message sent with a chilling Snapchat image of her holding a blade.
Jackson, whose late dad was Tobin's brother, contacted the Paisley youngster several times a day after accusing the girl of speaking to her boyfriend.
She is in custody at Cornton Vale prison near Stirling over her terrifying threats.
Tobin, 69, is serving three life sentences in Saughton jail for murdering three young women.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard Jackson was arrested at her home in the town last November after the child's mum called police.
The girl had been living with taunts and threats since July.
Julie O'Hara, prosecuting, said Jackson contacted the girl on Facebook and said they should meet. O'Hara said: “The accused thereafter said she was going to ‘slash' the complainer. She contacted the complainer on her mobile phone about five times a day stating ‘she had messed with the wrong person'."

The court heard Jackson threatened to go to the victim's school and said the girl would be a “sorry lassie” if she ever spoke to her boyfriend again. The youngster tried to warn Jackson off by claiming her dad was a police officer.
She replied: “What's he gonnae do? He will get smashed tae.”
The girl became concerned for her safety when Jackson sent her the knife picture and her mum then told police of the threats.
Jackson, who has been in custody since her arrest, last week admitted an offence under the Communications Act.
Michael McKeown, defending, said Jackson had a traumatic upbringing and struggled with behavioural problems and learning difficulties.
He claimed the victim's mum had responded by calling Jackson a “gingey f***” and warned she would do “damage to her”.
He asked for bail until sentencing next month but Sheriff Tom McCartney told Jackson: “Given your previous record of convictions, bail is not appropriate.”
Jackson was living at home with mum Anne, 49, when she targeted the schoolgirl.
She is the youngest of four children Anne had with Tobin's brother Robert. He died in 2008.
Tobin was jailed for the 2006 murder of student Angelika Kluk, 23. Her body was found hidden in the Glasgow church where the rapist was a handyman.
Police then found the remains of Vicky Hamilton, 15, and Dinah McNicol, 18, at Tobin's former homes.
In 2010, Jade's sister Charlene, 28, was segregated from one of her uncle's victims in Cornton Vale prison after boasting about being related to the fiend.
Warders were reported to be ensuring that the woman – who fought off knife-wielding Tobin in his Paisley flat in 2005 – did not meet her.
Fairfax, VA –-(Ammoland.com)- In a groundbreaking opinion examining the Gun Control Act's categorical prohibition on firearm possession for persons who have been “committed to a mental institution,” the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit determined the Second Amendment prohibited application of the ban to an individual who had been committed 28 years earlier and had no viable option for seeking restoration of his rights.
The case is Tyler v. Hillsdale Co. Sheriff's Dept.
Clifford Tyler is a 73-year-old man who does not currently suffer from mental illness and has no history of violence, unlawful behavior, or substance abuse. In 1985, when Tyler was 45 years old, his then-wife of 23 years left him for another man, depleted his finances, and filed for divorce. Tyler became distraught and suicidal, and he was involuntarily committed by a Michigan probate court, after his daughters called police for fear of his safety. Less than a month later, Tyler was released from the facility and returned to the workforce for nearly two decades.
A psychologist who evaluated Tyler in 2012 determined the 1985 commitment “appeared to be a brief reactive depressive episode in response to his wife divorcing him.”
Unlike other federal appellate courts, the Sixth Circuit evaluated Tyler's claim under strict scrutiny. This is the highest level of scrutiny in constitutional law that deals with situations in which the court examines whether the government's regulation relates to a sufficiently important governmental interest and is sufficiently “tailored” to achieving that interest. To satisfy strict scrutiny, the government's interest must be “compelling,” and the regulation must be “narrowly” tailored to achieving it.
Before turning to the “means-end” analysis, the court first concluded that the ban on individuals committed to a mental institution did not have a long pedigree in American law. It noted in this regard that mental institutions were virtually unheard of in America at the time the Second Amendment was adopted.
With regard to the strict scrutiny analysis, the government asserted the interests protected by the prohibition were “protecting the community from crime” and “preventing suicide,” which the court readily recognized as compelling. Thus, the case turned on whether the regulation was narrowly tailored to that end.
The court found that as applied to Taylor, it was not. First, unlike other categorical prohibitions on firearm possession in the Gun Control Act, the commitment prohibition could apply to non-violent, non-criminal individuals, who were prohibited based on conduct that was not under their control.
The court also reasoned that Congress itself did not intend for all previously committed people to lose their Second Amendment rights for life, because it created two roads to relief.
One is a petition process administered under federal law, and another is federal recognition of certain state relief from disability procedures. In Tyler's case, however, neither option was available. Congress has defunded the federal relief procedure since 1992, and Michigan has not enacted a state relief procedure that complies with federal law.
Thus, as applied to Tyler, the prohibition for previously committed individuals was “overbroad” and therefore not narrowly tailored. “The government's interest in keeping firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill is not sufficiently related to depriving the mentally healthy, who had a distant episode of commitment, of their constitutional rights.”
The court's opinion demonstrates the outcome of a scholarly, inquisitive analysis of the issue before it. Unfortunately, few other federal appellate courts have demonstrated a similar “commitment” to a thorough review of Second Amendment issues, and have treated the issue with condescension and superficiality, if not outright hostility.
Indeed, the court itself stated “we do not believe that any other court of appeals in a reasoned opinion has reviewed a firearm restriction as severe as this one”.
The Sixth Circuit covers portions of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee.

Rachel Nichols details all the changes the NBA is making to the All-Star Game. (2:15)
The NBA All-Star Game is switching formats this season, as two captains will select the teams without regard to which conferences the players play in, the league announced Tuesday.
The players who win the fan vote from each conference will be the captains.
There will still be 12 players selected from each conference for the game in Los Angeles on Feb. 18. Five players from each conference will be selected as starters, with the fan vote being worth 50 percent, player vote worth 25 percent and media vote worth 25 percent. Seven reserves for each team will be picked by each conference's head coaches.
The new system will enable players from each conference to play against each other and will allow current teammates to face off. Starters will be picked first, so the 10 players voted in as starters will remain that way.
Last season, LeBron James led fan voting in the Eastern Conference and Stephen Curry had the honor in the West. All-Star voting will begin on Christmas Day.

The timing and details of the All-Star draft have not yet been determined, but it will be before All-Star Weekend. The starters will be announced Jan. 18, the reserves Jan. 23.
The format will add a layer of intrigue to the event, as the captains will have to consider an array of factors when making the playground-style selections. Past, current and future relationships between players might be considered when making the selections.
Editor's Picks NBA almost got the All-Star changes right this time Kevin Pelton likes the new All-Star concept but wonders why the NBA won't just pick the 24 best players.
The change was part of a joint effort from the league and the players' union -- specifically union president Chris Paul. It was discussed over the course of the past few years. The league had revamped the voting system last season.
Hornets owner Michael Jordan, as the chairman of the owners' labor relations committee, was heavily involved in making the change on the league side.
"I'm thrilled with what the players and the league have done to improve the All-Star Game, which has been a priority for all of us," Paul said. "We're looking forward to putting on an entertaining show in L.A."
It is a part of a package of changes the NBA has made this season with fan interest in mind. Other changes include making scheduling and rule changes to reduce players missing games to rest and the reduction of timeouts to speed up end-of-game situations.
"We're excited about the new All-Star format and appreciate the players' willingness to try something new," said Byron Spruell, the league's president of league operations.
There will also be a new charity element added to this season's game. Each team will select a national or Los Angeles-area charity where donations from the game will be directed.
The coaches will be determined the same way as in the past. The coach with the best record two weeks before the game in each conference will get the honor of leading the team selected by the captain of his conference.
Steve Kerr of the Warriors and Brad Stevens of the Celtics are ineligible because they coached last year.
“I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values.” --Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 1967
One. Human rights must be taken absolutely seriously. Every single person is entitled to dignity and human rights. No application needed. No exclusions at all. This is our highest priority.
Two. We must radically reinvent contemporary democracy. Current systems are deeply corrupt and not responsive to the needs of people. Representatives chosen by money and influence govern by money and influence. This is unacceptable. Direct democracy by the people is now technologically possible and should be the rule. Communities must be protected whenever they advocate for self-determination, self-development and human rights. Dissent is essential to democracy; we pledge to help it flourish.
Three. Corporations are not people and are not entitled to human rights. Amend the US Constitution so it is clear corporations do not have constitutional or human rights. We the people must cut them down to size and so democracy can regulate their size, scope and actions.
Four. Leave the rest of the world alone. Cut US military spending by 75 percent and bring all troops outside the US home now. Defense of the US is a human right. Global offense and global police force by US military are not. Eliminate all nuclear and chemical and biological weapons. Stop allowing scare tactics to build up the national security forces at home. Stop the myth that the US is somehow special or exceptional and is entitled to act differently than all other nations. The US must re-join the global family of nations as a respectful partner. USA is one of many nations in the world. We must start acting like it.
Five. Property rights, privilege, and money-making are not as important as human rights. When current property and privilege arrangements are not just they must yield to the demands of human rights. Money-making can only be allowed when human rights are respected. Exploitation is unacceptable. There are national and global poverty lines. We must establish national and global excess lines so that people and businesses with extra houses, cars, luxuries, and incomes share much more to help everyone else be able to exercise their basic human rights to shelter, food, education and healthcare. If that disrupts current property, privilege and money-making, so be it.
Six. Defend our earth. Stop pollution, stop pipelines, stop new interstates, and stop destroying the land, sea, and air by extracting resources from them. Rebuild what we have destroyed. If corporations does not stop voluntarily, people must stop them. The very existence of life is at stake.
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
We respect the human rights and human dignity of others and work for a world where love and wisdom and solidarity and respect prevail.
Seven. Dramatically expand public spaces and reverse the privatization of public services. Quality public education, health and safety for all must be provided by transparent accountable public systems. Starving the state is a recipe for destroying social and economic human rights for everyone but the rich.
Eight. Pull the criminal legal prison system up and out by its roots and start over. Cease the criminalization of drugs, immigrants, poor people and people of color. We are all entitled to be safe but the current system makes us less so and ruins millions of lives. Start over.
Nine. The US was created based on two original crimes that must be confessed and made right. Reparations are owed to Native Americans because their land was stolen and they were uprooted and slaughtered. Reparations are owed to African Americans because they were kidnapped, enslaved and abused. The US has profited widely from these injustices and must make amends.
Ten. Everyone who wants to work should have the right to work and earn a living wage. Any workers who want to organize and advocate for change in solidarity with others must be absolutely protected from recriminations from their employer and from their government.
Finally, if those in government and those in power do not help the people do what is right, people seeking change must together exercise our human rights and bring about these changes directly. Dr. King and millions of others lived and worked for a radical revolution of values. We will as well. We respect the human rights and human dignity of others and work for a world where love and wisdom and solidarity and respect prevail. We expect those for whom the current unjust system works just fine will object and oppose and accuse people seeking dramatic change of being divisive and worse. That is to be expected because that is what happens to all groups which work for serious social change. Despite that, people will continue to go forward with determination and purpose to bring about a radical revolution of values in the USA.
Ontario hydro bills are scheduled to increase as temperatures decrease, the Ontario Energy Board announced Thursday.
The price per kilowatt hour will go up for on-, off- and mid-peak hours of the day starting November 1.
The Board says the changes will translate into a 1.7 per cent increase on a typical bill. That's about $2 a month for the average household.
The lowest priced periods remain weekdays from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., as well as all day during weekends and holidays. The off-peak price will be 7.7 cents per kilowatt hour — a 0.2 cent increase from current prices.
Electricity prices in Ontario have now gone up 51 per cent in off-peak usage, 41 per cent in mid-peak usage and 41 per cent in peak usage in the last four years.
Before the Columbia Planning and Zoning Commission held the first public hearing to begin an official review of a 400-plus-page zoning code revision, the city planning staff had received a stream of more than 200 written comments suggesting changes or asking questions about the document.
That stream quickly became a flood of public comment at the Oct. 20 hearing, which was supposed to cover all six segments of the zoning code rewrite that was one result of the �Columbia Imagined� planning process that concluded three years ago. Instead of checking off all six segments, commissioners were just finishing up the first two segments as the clock approached 1 a.m.
Four public meetings � taking a cumulative 24 hours � later, the process is nearing the end.
�It�s been a grind,� said City Development Services Manager Pat Zenner. �We have reviewed a massive amount of work� during a �very elongated public hearing process.�
Another handful of zoning commission work sessions and public hearings are scheduled between now and Jan. 5, when the commission is expected to make a recommendation to the city council to approve or reject the zoning code revision.
FINDING BALANCE
Public involvement and interest in the zoning code review continues to intensify. The Columbia Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday unveiled its local agenda for city government for 2017. One of the seven priorities listed �the need for clear, consistent and equitable regulations for city staff to implement.� Chamber officials said the zoning code review was one aim of that priority and echoed criticism among developers, Realtors and banking officials who worry increased regulation on building and development could stymie growth.
Mayor Brian Treece said the revised zoning code, officially known as the Uniform Development Code, is an attempt to �strike that balance between flexibility and predictability� when it comes to applying regulations.
�Everybody wants clear and consistent rules to follow except when they don�t want to follow them,� Treece said, wondering how many interactions with city planning staff involve requests for exceptions � perhaps to the point that �the exception has become the rule.�
The city council on Nov. 21 approved extending a moratorium on downtown development until March 31 or until a new zoning code is adopted. City officials also still are waiting to receive zoning code review and recommendations from two city task forces that are weighing in on the rapid growth of high-rise student apartment buildings throughout downtown.
Meanwhile, a group of 23 property owners is seeking to downzone 37 parcels in the Benton-Stephens neighborhood from R-3, which allows multifamily housing, to R-1 zoning, which allows single-family housing, in an attempt to preserve the character of their neighborhood and thwart even more multifamily apartment complexes � and to take advantage of special neighborhood protection standards that could be part of the zoning code revision.
Those standards were the main focus of a lengthy and contentious Planning and Zoning Commission work session Thursday as commissioners struggled to find consensus on proposed regulations to protect the residential character of neighborhoods while also allowing property owners to redevelop properties they consider investments.
Zenner said the process to review the new zoning code might be �a little more painful� than some communities experience because Columbia�s code hasn�t been overhauled since 1964. He said the majority of the change is in how the code is structured as well as how properties and buildings can be used. Some portions of the proposed regulations seek to codify longstanding policy and practices.
�It�s been tweaked here and there and cobbled together� over the years, Zenner said. �I won�t diminish the fact that this is significant. There is a lot of change here. ... This impacts their livelihood, their property, their investments.�
A primary feature of the new zoning code is the move to downtown form-based zoning that incorporates a set of rules that focuses on guiding the way buildings are constructed rather than how they are used. That concept stemmed from the Columbia Imagined communitywide �visioning� process in 2008 that led to a new comprehensive plan for community growth and development two years later.
As a result, the city council awarded a $150,000 contract to Clarion and Associates and Ferrell Madden to help revise zoning and subdivision codes. Since May, the Planning and Zoning Commission has hosted nearly 30 public meetings to gather input on the new code.
A THOROUGH REVIEW
Commissioner Anthony Stanton has commended the large crowds that have attended and stayed through long meetings to offer opinions as the commission attempts to address �the gunslinger mentality of development downtown.�
While city staff insist the zoning revision process has been underway for at least a few years and that there have been multiple opportunities for public input, the current draft under review only has been available for a few months, said Heather Hargrove, co-chairwoman of the Columbia Chamber�s government affairs committee.
�We want to give it the attention it deserves to make sure it�s in its best form possible before being voted on,� Hargrove said. �There�s no doubt that it needs to be revisited. There�s no argument there.�
The six segments of the proposed zoning code cover myriad regulations, including general zoning provisions; subdivisions; parking and loading; tree preservation and landscaping; special rules for mixed-downtown development, or M-DT rules; a new table of permitted uses; the length of time required to develop a preliminary plat; rules for continuing nonconforming use of property; and neighborhood protection standards.
The Planning and Zoning Commission will meet Thursday to wrap up discussion on potential amendments to the segment pertaining to neighborhood protection standards. Commissioners also will receive a sheet from Zenner listing all of the proposed amendments to date.
The commission meets again Dec. 15 for a work session and special public hearing to receive additional comments on all segments and to make final recommendations for amendments. Zenner said the Jan. 5 meeting will be a work session and regular meeting � along with a final public hearing � leading to a final recommendation to the city council.
Developers, property owners, bankers and business leaders have assailed the zoning code revision on several fronts. Bankers have said some of the new regulations for downtown would make them reluctant to make loans for new projects. Developers have warned the new code would increase costs for builders and buyers � and thus discourage investment in the growing community.
Others have called many of the code�s provisions �an assault� on property rights and warned of the �unintended consequences� of higher costs and cumbersome rules prompting owners of smaller properties to sell their property to big developers.
Commissioner Tootie Burns has said more than once that she was not in favor of throwing out the proposed revision as some speakers suggested.
�There�s a lot of good in this document,� Burns said.
SEEKING STRICTER PROTECTIONS
Pat Fowler, a homeowner in the North-Central Arts District, has advocated for even stricter neighborhood protections. She said the north-central neighborhood was �the most mixed-use section in our city,� with single-family homes, churches, a brewery, lumberyard, funeral home, art gallery, railroad, child care centers and three homeless shelters.
Those building uses are �in scale� with each other and with the scattering of single-family homes and duplexes, unlike the Brookside apartments at College Avenue and Walnut Street that brought an influx of new residents � mostly students � to the area. Fowler said the character of the neighborhood changed dramatically in 2012 when the Brookside on College student apartments opened.
She referred to issues caused by �725 unsupervised young people� and said that only two homes on nearby Hubbell and St. Joseph streets currently are occupied by homeowners who were there when Brookside opened.
�We�re not making up worst-case scenarios,� she said. �They already exist.�
The neighborhood protection standards being considered would change the way property can be redeveloped into multifamily housing as well as commercial use. Realtor Paul Land recently presented the commission with a list of 50 commercial properties that adjoin R-1 and R-2, which allows for single-family or duplexes, single parcels. If the proposed neighborhood protection rules are adopted, the commercial properties would have to meet new property line setback, height and other restrictions to redevelop after a fire or similar disaster.
Land called the proposed changes �a recipe for disaster� and asked whether the proposed code is �really a better code than the one we have.� Land said what other developers and property owners have expressed: many homeowners moved to R-1 and R-2 properties knowing a commercial property was next door.
The downzoning request by Benton-Stephens property owners is unrelated to the ongoing zoning code review except for the additional protections that might come with a new zoning code. All the properties currently are zoned R-3, which allows for multifamily apartment complexes. R-1 would preserve those parcels as single-family lots.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
Rita Fleischmann and her husband, Peter Norgard, spearheaded the group effort to rezone from R-3 to R-1. Fleischmann called it �a unified stand� to preserve the residential character of the neighborhood.
�We reject the recent and rapid trend towards throwaway housing that resembles nothing like the neighborhood Benton-Stephens is,� Norgard wrote in a letter to the city�s planning staff.
Benton-Stephens residents gathered Tuesday night for a public information meeting on their request in the lobby at City Hall. City planner Steve McIntyre said there�s precedent for downzoning, but not for upzoning from R-1 to R-3.
�It�s certainly a neighborhood preservation issue,� McIntyre said.
Jenny McDonald, who owns one of the lots seeking rezoning, said the neighborhood has �been hit pretty hard� by redevelopment of R-3 lots as multifamily buildings.
�Columbia doesn�t have that many old homes left. Some of us aren�t ready to give up,� McDonald said. �We�ve had a lousy culture of preservation � not a lot of incentive� from the city �to preserve things.�
The rezoning effort was too late to have an effect on a proposed six-plex, two-story townhome apartment development on Windsor Street between Ripley and Williams streets. Mark Stevenson, a partner in the townhome project and owner of other R-3 lots in the neighborhood, said he bought a number of properties �with future redevelopment in mind.�
�There are thousands of students who would like to live closer to their classrooms,� he said.
His wife, Carol, said R-3 zoning makes the property more valuable because of the multiple options for use.
�People do not realize they are losing property values,� she added.
Norgard said the rapid development of student housing was �alarming.�
�We bought into the neighborhood not to make money but to have a place to live,� he said. �The neighborhood wants to remain a neighborhood, not a college dormitory wasteland.�
THE brother of a Sydney mother facing jail time in Lebanon over adultery charges says her family has “disowned her” and hopes she is sent to prison.
Mahassen Issa is pleading for help from the Australian government after she was charged with adultery during a short holiday to see her new partner in Lebanon.

Her brother, Ahmed, said he had warned his sister about pursuing the relationship because she had not been separated from her husband for 12 months.
“What she did was wrong. If you travel to any country, you have to adhere to their laws,” Ahmed said.

“It's against our religion and it's against Lebanese law. We, as a family, have disowned her.
“I hope she rots in hell.”
Ms Issa's lawyer said last night she would face court in Tripoli, Lebanon, today and could face six months jail if convicted.
Her husband's family in Sydney has welcomed her being charged and wants the mother of two children, aged six and nine, to be jailed.
Ms Issa, 29, travelled to Tripoli on June 20 to see her new boyfriend after recently separating from her husband.
She was about to return home on the weekend when she claimed she was contacted by Lebanese police informing her she had been charged with adultery.
“We got a phone call stating my partner and I have both been charged and that we need to go and see the police,” Ms Issa said.

“My passport has been alerted to all the authorities and that I'm not allowed to exit the country. “I will be facing the charges tomorrow at court.” A distraught Ms Issa yesterday said she believed the allegations were made to prevent her from returning to Sydney, where she was born, to live with her children.
“The thought of not seeing my children again and my whole family disowning me, it's too much,” she said.
A relative of Ms Issa's husband said he raised the court order for adultery charges in Lebanon because the couple were still married in Australia: “His family and her family are very happy that she's getting charged and she's getting what she deserves.
“We raised the court case and he's going ahead with it.”
Ms Issa claimed the pair separated in September but her former husband said they separated in April.

Their children are currently being cared for by their father in Western Sydney.
Ms Issa was last night at the Australian Consulate General in Beirut, saying she feared for her life and that of her boyfriend.
“I'm in a huge panic and I have no one to turn to. My family has disowned me. We have been receiving threats, my partner has received threats,'' she said.
“The holiday that I thought would just be some time out has turned into a nightmare. I have never seen these jails and hope to never see them, because we have done nothing wrong.
“Hopefully the Australian government can help me get back into Australia safely.”
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed support was being provided to Ms Issa in Lebanon but would not provide further details.
Where, exactly, is your threshold for outrage?
Would you speak up if you were overbilled for a meal? Would you complain if you paid for a book from Amazon.com that never arrived?
Or what if you had to keep making monthly mortgage payments even after your loan was fully repaid?
Well, guess what? If you're like most people, you're participating in exactly that kind of rip-off right now. It's the Great Cellphone Subsidy Con.
When you buy a cellphone — an iPhone or Android phone, let's say — you pay $200. Now, the real price for that sophisticated piece of electronics is around $600. But Verizon, AT&T and Sprint are very thoughtful. They subsidize the phone. Your $200 is a down payment. You pay off the remaining $400 over the course of your two-year contract.
It's just like buying a house or a car: you put some cash down and pay the rest in installments. Right?
For a man who thinks he's a robot, Professor Patrick Haggard is remarkably cheerful about it. "We certainly don't have free will," says the leading British neuroscientist. "Not in the sense we think." It's quite a way to start an interview.
We're in the Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience , in Queen Square in London, the nerve centre – if you will – of British brain research. Prof Haggard is demonstrating "transcranial magnetic stimulation", a technique that uses magnetic coils to affect one's brain, and then to control the body. One of his research assistants, Christina Fuentes, is holding a loop-shaped paddle next to his head, moving it fractionally. "If we get it right, it might cause something." She presses a switch, and the coil activates with a click. Prof Haggard's hand twitches. "It's not me doing that," he assures me, "it's her."
The machinery can't force Prof Haggard to do anything really complicated – "You can't make me sign my name," he says, almost ruefully – but at one point, Christina is able to waggle his index finger slightly, like a schoolmaster. It's very fine control, a part of the brain specifically in command of a part of the body. "There's quite a detailed map of the brain's wiring to the body that you can build," he tells me.
I watch as Christina controls Prof Haggard's fingers like a marionette. The mechanical nature of it is unsettling. A graph on a screen shows his muscle activity plotted by time; 20 milliseconds after she clicks the button, it depicts an elegant leap and drop, like a heartbeat on an ECG. That 20 milliseconds is how long it takes for the signal to travel down his nerves. "The conduction time would be less from my jaw muscles, more from my leg muscles," he says. And as many of us will recognise, the process gets less effective as we age: "As I get older, the curve will move slowly to the right on the graph."
The idea that our bodies can be controlled by an outside force is a pretty astonishing one. "This is absolutely out of my control," insists Prof Haggard, as his muscles continue to move. "I'm not doing it, Christina is. I'm just a machine, and she is operating me."
What does this mean in terms of free will? "We don't have free will, in the spiritual sense. What you're seeing is the last output stage of a machine. There are lots of things that happen before this stage – plans, goals, learning – and those are the reasons we do more interesting things than just waggle fingers. But there's no ghost in the machine."
The conclusions are shocking: if we are part of the universe, and obey its laws, it's hard to see where free will comes into it. What we think of as freedom, he says, is a product of complexity. "An amoeba has one input, one output. If you touch it with one chemical, it engulfs it; with another, it recoils.
"If you see a light go green, it may mean press the accelerator; but there are lots of situations where it doesn't mean that: if the car in front hasn't moved, for example. The same stimulus sometimes makes me press the accelerator, but sometimes the horn. We are not one output-one input beings; we have to cope with a messy world of inputs, an enormous range of outputs. I think the term 'free will' refers to the complexity of that arrangement."
Slowly, however, we are learning more about the details of that complexity. This, Prof Haggard says, has profound implications: philosophically, morally, and – most worryingly – legally. "We understand what brain areas are responsible for impulsive behaviour, and which bits are responsible for inhibiting that behaviour. There's a whole brain network associated with holding back from things you shouldn't do.
"What happens if someone commits a crime, and it turns out that there's a lesion in that brain area? Is that person responsible? Is the damage to the machine sufficient for us to exempt them from that very basic human idea that we are responsible for our actions? I don't know." He refers to a major project in America, where "lawyers, neuroscientists, philosophers and psychiatrists are all trying to work out what impact brain science has on our socio-legal sense of responsibility".
This runs shockingly contrary to the sense of freedom that we feel in terms of controlling our actions, on which we base our whole sense of self and system of morality. "As far as I know," says Prof Haggard, "all societies hold individuals responsible for their actions. Even in animal societies, individuals have reputations. Non-human primates adjust their behaviour according to how other animals will respond. Junior males will not steal from older males, because they know they'll get beaten up. That's the beginning of social responsibility; the awareness that your behaviour has effects on the behaviour of others, and can have good or bad consequences.
"It's a rule that we need to have as social animals. You couldn't have society unless, if you do something wrong, you pay for it. The question is, what do we do when people don't have the brain machinery to play by the rules – or decide not to play by them? That's not a scientific question. That's a moral one."
Maybe, I suggest, we've over-defined free will. Perhaps it doesn't exist in the mystical breaking-the-laws-of-the-universe way, but there is a sense in which this "me", this brain and body, responds to the world, reacts to information, tries to shape its environment; takes decisions. Can we not pull free will back to something more defensible? He taps his fingers.
"Yes, interacting intelligently with your environment might be enough. The philosophical definition of free will uses the phrase 'could have done otherwise'. I picked up the blue cup; could I have picked up the white one? Given the initial conditions, the world as it was, could I have acted differently?
"As a neuroscientist, you've got to be a determinist. There are physical laws, which the electrical and chemical events in the brain obey. Under identical circumstances, you couldn't have done otherwise; there's no 'I' which can say 'I want to do otherwise'. It's richness of the action that you do make, acting smart rather than acting dumb, which is free will."
Some philosophers – Robert Kane, and, famously, Karl Popper and John Eccles – have held out hope that quantum indeterminacy, the randomness at the level of the universe's finest grains, could rescue true freedom.
Prof Haggard is dismissive. "No one wants to be told they're just a machine. But there is simply nothing approaching convincing evidence for the quantum view. Popper and Eccles proposed that free will was due to quantum indeterminacy in the chemical messages that communicate between neurons.
"But none of that happens at the quantum level. From a physics point of view, it's macro-level." Besides, quantum activity is purely random, and randomness gives you no more freedom than determinism does.
Does this bother you, I ask? Being a machine? "I keep my personal and professional lives pretty separate," he says, smiling. "I still seem to decide what films I go to see, I don't feel it's predestined, though it must be determined somewhere in my brain.
"There's an idea in theology that our free will places us next to God. Milton describes this beautifully in Paradise Lost. We like to think we're wonderful, that we have this marvellous capacity. But we should be more impartial: perhaps we overestimate the value and the excitement of having free will."
On that note, I take my leave. Although really, I didn't have any choice.
SACRAMENTO (CBS13) — Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies are hunting for the suspects who shot and killed three people in South Sacramento Thursday.
It happened along the 8700 block of Ardith Drive near Rothenburg Court around 6:30 a.m.
Sheriff's detectives combed the home where the triple shooting happened for more than 12 hours Thursday, interviewing family and neighbors of the victims.
A spokesperson for the Sacramento Sheriff's Department says the victims were 56-year-old Thanh Le and his two sons, 21-year-old Tien Le and 32-year-old Dong Le.
The Sheriff's Department confirms a group of men, all wearing dark clothing and masks, barged into one of the victim's home, with a plan to commit robbery.
Sgt. Tony Turnbull with the Sacramento Sheriff's Department says, “In cases like these, they are very rarely a random event and the family was most likely targeted.”
Turnbull says the suspects were then seen leaving the home in a dark car.
Homicide detectives and officers from the gang unit combed the neighborhood, and, at one point, were seen driving family members and witnesses away from the scene.
The Sheriff's Department can't confirm the relation between the suspects and the victims.
Detectives tell CBS13 they don't suspect narcotics or gang activity to be a motive in the triple homicide.

A Florida man was arrested after police mistook the glaze from a Krispy Kreme donut as methamphetamine.
According to the arrest report, Daniel Rushing, was pulled over by Orlando police on December 11, 2015, for speeding and not coming to a full stop when exiting a parking lot. During the traffic stop, Rushing, 64, informed the officer he had a concealed weapon and agreed to a search of his vehicle.

One of the officers noticed a "rock like substance" on the floor board of the car by Rushing's feet. Three other pieces were found in the car, and two separate field tests "indicated the presence of methamphetamines," according to the arrest report.
"I kept telling them, 'That's … glaze from a doughnut," Rushing told The Orlando Sentinel. "They tried to say it was crack cocaine at first then they said, 'No, it's meth, crystal meth.'"
Testing by The Florida Department of Law Enforcement proved otherwise. The FDLE lab report stated no controlled substances were found in the evidence officers submitted.
It's not the first time confectionary has caused a law enforcement mix-up. A University of Miami student who claimed he left lines of powdered sugar on his dorm room coffee table was jailed for cocaine possession, while in 2014 a Florida man tried to pass off a crumbled-up Pop-Tart as cocaine to an undercover cop.

Most of you are probably familiar with half-life. Many subatomic particles are not stable, and so, after a short time, some of them decay (change into something else). The half-life of a particle is how long the particle has to wait until it had a 50-50 chance of decaying.
For example, muons have a half-life of about 2.2 microseconds. So, if you had 100 muons, 2.2 microseconds later you should only have 50 muons.
Right?
Well, actually… it depends!
The 2.2 microseconds is time that has passed for the muon. If you have 100 muons just sitting there, after 2.2 microseconds there will be about 50 left. But, in the last post, we introduced the idea of time dilation. If you have a friend shoot by you in a rocket ship going half the speed of light, while you think 10 seconds have passed, your friend will have only experienced 8.66 seconds.
The same thing works just as well for muons. So, if instead of just sitting there, your 100 muons are traveling in a particle accelerator at half the speed of light, after 2.2 microseconds have passed for you, only microseconds have passed for the muons. A quick calculation shows that about 55 muons would still remain!
In your reference frame, microseconds would need to pass before the muons experienced 2.2 microseconds. So, only after 2.54 microseconds would you have 50 muons!
This is why time dilation is one of the most thoroughly tested facts in science. We can measure the half-life of particles that are just sitting there. But, every day, particles are traveling around particle accelerators at near the speed of light. The half-lives of these particles can be compared to those sitting still. The relative half-lives line up precisely with the predictions of special relativity!
Let's derive a formula for this effect. Last time, we gave the metric for special relativity as . The speed of time, i.e., how fast time passes for something traveling along a path, was given by . If you are traveling at a constant speed , we know that . (Recall that, in relativity, it's convenient to measure speeds as a ratio of the speed of light. So is half the speed of light, so second should mean .)
Rearranging this, we see that the speed of time is . To interpret this, is how fast time is passing for you, while is how fast it is passing for, say, your friend in the rocket ship. So, the quantity gives how much faster time is passing for you than for your friend! Let's call this quantity the “time dilation factor.”
Another common example of this time dilation is GPS satellites.
GPS satellites are essentially (three) super accurate clocks. They orbit the Earth at about 14000 km/hr (0.000013 of the speed of light), while we mostly sit still.
GPS satellites work by sending out a regular signal saying what time they think it is. If you receive a signal from four of them, they will be slightly differently delayed depending on how far away they are. If you know where they are in the sky, you can then (in theory) calculate where you are.
The problem is that the time dilation factor shows that the clocks on the satellites experience 7 microseconds less time per day than our clocks on Earth do. A naive calculation then shows that the GPS position should be off by kilometers per day.
That standard reasoning is slightly flawed, though. Yes, our thug friend who always travels with an atomic clock absolutely could compare his clock to the clocks on board three GPS satellites, and then be able to calculate his position.
You, presumably, aren't like him and don't have an atomic clock with you. This means that you have no way of measuring that a satellite's clock is “wrong” compared to your atomic clock because… you don't have one.
You're far more likely to have a smartphone with GPS. This doesn't bother measuring how time passes at your position–after all, it isn't as accurate as an atomic clock, so that would be futile. Instead, it calculates your position by comparing the times from four different satellites instead of three.
The satellites are all at the same elevation above the earth and are all traveling at the same speed, and so they all experience the same time dilation. Since your position is calculated by comparing the times from different satellites, the time dilation factor cancels out, and so you would still calculate the correct position.
The time dilation would make some difference, though, in a different way. As part of the calculation, your phone needs to know where the satellites are supposed to be in the sky. The expected positions of the satellites would end up being wrong by a few cm/day, as compared to the time the satellites were transmitting. Over a year this adds up, and so the creators of the GPS system took this dilation into account, but this effect is still fairly small.
Next, let's talk about the twin paradox.
Early in your life, you discovered that your twin was the evil one.
To spare the world her monstrosities, you sent your twin off in a rocketship at 90% of the speed of light, putting her safely out of reach of the Earth.
Unfortunately, due to time dilation, time for your twin passes at of the rate it passes for you. Nine years for you makes her only age four years.
If your twin manages to turn around the ship, and make it back at the same speed, you'd have aged 18 years, and she'd have aged only eight!
Often, this story stops here. Your evil twin still has plenty of time to wreak havoc on the world!
But, if we look a little closer, a question arises.
Relative to your evil twin, you're the one traveling at 90% of the speed of light, and so after nine years have passed for her, you should've only aged by four years. In other words, if she thinks eight years passed before her return, you should have aged only three and a half years!
So, when she gets back, which one of you actually is older?
This is the heart of the twin paradox.
At first glance, this paradox seems to spell doom for special relativity. In fact, some… well-meaning… but confused people make entire websites devoted to showing that the twin paradox shows that all of modern science is wrong. (Spoiler: It's not.)
The confusion comes about because of a misunderstanding about simultaneity versus time dilation. Let's draw a spacetime diagram for the twin paradox.
Using the same definition of simultaneity as before, the events you think are simultaneous are horizontal lines. If we draw this line just before nine years have passed for you, we see your nine years is right near where your twin turned around.
And, using the metric from last time to calculate the time experienced by your twin, we can calculate that only four years have passed for her.
But, the principle of relativity, one of the two assumptions of special relativity, says that the laws of physics should be the same for your twin as they are for you. So, when your twin has experienced those four years, you should have only experienced years.
Impossible, right?
But the trick is to realize that you aren't comparing the same things!
Remember how everyone disagrees on what events are simultaneous? Let's draw your evil twin's line of simultaneity for all events just before she seizes control of the rocket. (!!!)
Next, let's draw the line of simultaneity for all events just after she seizes control of the rocket (and is thus returning to Earth at 90% of the speed of light).
While your twin is travelling at 90% of the speed of light, you both think the other is aging more slowly. The trick is that you are comparing different things! To illustrate this, let's highlight the parts of your path that your twin is comparing her trip to.
At the sharp turn, your twin's idea of simultaneity changes, and that explains why you can both think the other is aging more slowly.
In particular, your twin has to accelerate, while you don't. That acceleration is what breaks the symmetry, since the principle of relativity only says that the laws of physics work the same for people with constant velocity.
Now, this is a good argument, and true. But, still, some people will argue that this reasoning is flawed.
How can we be 100% sure we're correct?
Using the ideas from our intro to relativity, it's actually quite easy.
The important claim we made in the last post is that any path has the same length for everyone, when measured using the metric . This length has the universal interpretation as the length of time experienced by someone travelling on that path. The quantity is something everyone can agree on, even if they disagree on which events are simultaneous.
We didn't actually prove this in the last post, but this fact means that everyone, in the end, agrees that you aged eighteen years and your evil twin aged only eight.
For better or worse.
If you enjoyed this post, please share it with your friends. And don't forget to subscribe for more math awesomeness!
Special relativity is awesome, but general relativity is even more awesome. (After all, it's what I do research in!) But to really talk about general relativity, we need to first introduce some concepts from geometry, curvature and geodesics. We'll start with curvature next time.

CLOSE Uber-owned Otto partners with Anheuser-Busch to successfully test self-driving truck technology in Colorado.

SAN FRANCISCO — If you're sipping a Budweiser somewhere in Colorado Springs, you just might have a robot to thank for that thirst-quenching brew.
Last week, self-driving truck start-up Otto teamed with Anheuser-Busch to successfully deliver a semi-tractor full of beer from Fort Collins, through Denver and on to the southern Colorado city in the shadow of Pikes Peak.
For the majority of that 120-mile trip, the truck's driver left his seat and observed the road from the comfort of the sleeper berth. An Otto video of the drive shows the slightly disconcerting image of a massive 53-foot trailer filled with 2,000 cases of Bud rumbling down I-25 with no human in the cab.
Otto's tech is at present confined to highways, and humans take over in city traffic. Otto and Anheuser-Busch, which announced the news Tuesday, plan additional real-world autonomous truck drives in the months ahead.
"The initial appeal for us was to see how we could meet the needs of a company like Anheuser-Busch," Otto co-founder Lior Ron tells USA TODAY. "But now after this successful test, we're eager to see how it will handle other roads and other weather."
An Otto truck driver watches the wheel from the cab of his truck as it navigates I-25 heading to Colorado Springs with a full shipment of Budweiser. (Photo11: Otto)
The Otto landmark stands in stark contrast to the ongoing self-driving car tests by Google, Uber and Ford in California, Arizona and other states that require a safety driver to remain at the wheel in case of emergencies.
At present, states offer self-driving tech companies a patchwork of laws that, in time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is hoping to corral into a cohesive autonomous car policy.
In Colorado, the Department of Transportation worked with Otto for a number of months evaluating the company's technology and joining on test runs before agreeing to let an Otto semi roll along without a driver in the cab.
"Safety remained our primary concern, but we believe that in this case the driver is the automated system itself," says Amy Ford, spokeswoman for the Colorado DOT, whose RoadX mission is to partner with innovative companies to help insure that the state leads the way in the coming transportation revolution. "We'd like to help get this tech deployed in the real world."
Otto, which was founded early this year by Google Car veterans Ron and Anthony Levandowski, was bought by Uber last August for $670 million. Uber is boosting its self-driving tech initiative with Levandowski now in charge of leading the ride-hailing giant's charge.
The concept behind Otto is to produce an aftermarket kit comprised of radar and camera sensors that, when harnessed to proprietary software, will allow the nation's 350,000 owner-operator truckers to keep their trucks on the road longer without cutting into their carefully monitored driving time.
Otto's — and Uber's — interest in cornering the trucking market doesn't need much explanation. In 2015, trucking brought in $726 billion in revenue and accounted for 81% of all freight transport, according to the American Trucking Associations.

Trucking industry advocates remain concerned about both the technology's ability to decipher every road emergency and the danger of having a driver resting or even sleeping while a truck is at highway speeds.
For Anheuser-Busch Inbev, a global spirits juggernaut valued at $213 billion, the appeal of the partnership was to "see if we could help pioneer technology that will make the jobs of those shipping product easier and safer," says James Sembrot, senior director of logistics and safety for Anheuser-Busch.
Sembrot says the company's beer travels an estimated 450 million miles a year to its various destinations. Anheuser-Busch doesn't own any trucks, but rather contracts with 300 trucking companies nationwide.
"We liked the prospect of those folks traveling safer in trucks that help improve environmental impact (through increased gas mileage)," he says. "There's no question in our mind that transportation companies will want to make these improvements."

The city of Odessa in southern Ukraine was the scene of bloodshed on 2 May when 42 people were killed following street fighting between Ukrainian and ethnic Russian mobs. As chocolate tycoon Petro Poroshenko - who hails from the Odessa region - takes over as president, the city reflects on the violence.
In his story How It Was Done In Odessa, the Russian writer Isaak Babel - a Jew with glasses on his nose, and autumn in his heart - describes with awed fascination a hero he could never be - the mafia boss Benya Krik, also known as the King - suavest, brashest, deadliest of all the mobsters of that legendary city by the sea.

Benya Krik - what a fist-in-your-face kind of name - in his chocolate jacket, cream trousers and raspberry lace-up boots - he was a tiger, a lion, a cat… a young Jewish hustler, Babel writes, who could spend the night with a woman and leave her satisfied, who could lay on a magnificent funeral for an accidental victim of his own gang, a character who personified Babel's cosmopolitan, seamy home-town in the dying days of tsarism.
The city, then more than a third Jewish, was so famous for its high living that the Yiddish equivalent of "living in clover" is "lebn vi got in odes" or "living like God in Odessa".
Myths twine themselves around the town as tightly and luxuriantly as the trailing creepers that twine every sweaty summer around its wrought-iron balconies.
Drawn by the tales of easy living, I first came to Odessa 20-odd years ago for a romantic escape, like many other tourists, to stay in its grandest crumbling hotel.
Through the Soviet years, the great port had somehow kept its spirit. It kept it still through its first two decades in independent Ukraine.
But now I am back because new, uglier myths are winding themselves around Odessa, and a new ghoulish tourist attraction disfigures its heart - the burnt-out shell of the Trades Union Headquarters, its blackened Stalinist columns surrounded by heaps of now-withered flowers.

Earlier this month in and around this building, 42 people were killed in clashes between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian protesters, part of the conflict that is dividing the country ever more deeply.
Now, it is a place to be photographed. Young women in impossibly high heels totter over the charred timbers, through the paper-strewn sooty corridors, past the mangled office furniture.
Groups of schoolchildren sucking Coke from giant polystyrene cups wander past bloody palm-prints on the walls. So how did so many die in a city famed for its tolerance?
"They burned people alive... and those who jumped to save themselves were finished off with clubs."
That is what I am told from mourners bringing bouquets, by the gawpers inside, by taxi driver after taxi driver.
They are blaming the Ukrainian nationalists, supporters of their country's recent pro-Western revolution who, according to this version of events, drove their opponents - those who want closer links with Russia - into Trades Union House, and set light to it.
And then, from that other, nationalist and pro-Western camp, I hear the opposite: the pro-Russians barricaded themselves into the building and began to rain Molotov cocktails down on the crowd below.
There is talk of how they were supported by a pro-Moscow police chief - who has now fled - and even by the abbot of a Russian Orthodox monastery seen shipping mysterious crates from his cloisters during the bloodshed.
In the absence of almost any agreed facts about what really happened, it feels as though both sides are spinning myths - but unlike the celebratory tales of Isaak Babel, these myths divide the city.
Many locals are horrified: issues like autonomy or federalism, at the heart of the present conflict, do not matter to Odessans, I am told.
They do not even care that much which country they are in. They just want to get on with life.
Babel's Benya Krik - himself an invention, of course - was not much of a patriot either.
Did God not make an enormous mistake settling Jews in Russia? he asks in How It Was Done in Odessa. Why did he not put them in Switzerland, surrounded by first-class lakes and mountain air?

I am reminded of him again as I attend one of the last funerals for a victim of the Odessa clashes, shuffling through twisting, lilac-filled streets of wooden houses that can have changed little since Babel's time.
At the centre of his story is the burial of a hapless cashier, in the wrong place at the wrong time when one gangster raided another.
Today I am following the coffin of another accidental victim, a real one - Yevgeny Losinsky, a gentle man by all accounts, a passionate member of a historical re-enactment society who joined the pro-Russian protesters because he liked dressing up in medieval and World War Two costume.
Who is to blame for his death? One of his friends says not all Odessans are as innocent as him.
We let political passions boil over, he insists, we must draw back from the brink.
But as the incense and singing waft out of the gold-domed church, there is talk all around of dark, outside forces trying to destroy a unique city.
My head begins to swim. I wonder if I will ever really know how it was done in Odessa, this city of legends.

The general prosecutor's office said on Thursday that Ficior had introduced and "coordinated a repressive detention regime" between 1958 and 1963, when he was in command of the camp.
Investigators said the regime, which was described as "abusive and inhuman," had been aimed at exterminating political prisoners through harsh working conditions, extreme cold and a lack of such basic necessities as food, water and medicine.
A total of 103 prisoners are said to have died during Ficior's time in charge of the Periprava labor camp, situated by a remote village on the Danube delta, which held up to 2,000 prisoners.
Investigators looking into Communist-era crimes called on prosecutors to bring charges against Ficior in September. The request was part of a wider campaign aimed at bringing to justice 35 former prison commanders.
The same month, the investigating team found five skeletons in unmarked graves, without coffins, clothes or personal belongings, near to Periprava.
Second genocide case
Another former prison chief, 88-year-old Alexandru Visinescu, was charged with genocide in September.
It is not expected that either man will be jailed, being too old to be imprisoned under Romanian law.
Some 600,000 people were sentenced and jailed for political reasons between 1945 and 1989 in Romania.
Ficior, who declined to speak to reporters after he was charged, has previously disputed the number of people who died during his time in charge, claiming that only three or four people died while he was a commander.
The charge of genocide could be difficult to prosecute effectively, according to some experts. The United Nations defines genocide as an "act committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group." The wording does not mention political groups.

Right-wing evangelist Lance Wallnau streamed a video on Periscope last night in which he proclaimed that President Trump has been anointed by God to “subdue nations” that “are threatening God's purposes and holding back God's blueprint” for the world.
Reiterating his belief that Trump is a modern-day King Cyrus, Wallnau prophesied that Trump will “subdue” both Syria and North Korea because he is being guided by God to do so.
“No, Trump doesn't want to get involved in North Korea. Guess what he is going to do? He is going to disarm North Korea! Watch it!” Wallnau proclaimed. “He doesn't want to get involved in Syria. Guess what was the first nation that Cyrus, in Babylon, subdued? Syria. You can't make this stuff up, people.”
Wallnau said that “Trump is anointed to deal with rogue government, kings of the earth that are threatening God's purposes and holding back God's blueprint. This is a fascinating period of time to be alive.”
Trump's actions are a sign that “the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord,” Wallnau insisted, adding that while the president's actions may seem unpredictable, they are actually “totally predictable because God will move his heart.”
Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop proclaimed last week that he is “ready to explore” facilitating a homecoming for Cahill, though a club must express a firm interest first.
Cahill, who has scored three goals in nine appearances for a Hangzhou side setting third from bottom on the CSL ladder, has “two or three clubs” in China interested, according to his agent Ante Alilovic, who on Friday flies to Shanghai to talk to the various parties as Cahill's current contract nears expiration.
Alilovic is confident that 36 year-old Cahill will most likely remain in China for now but that Australia's all-time top scorer “wants to give something back”, which could mean an A-League swansong sooner rather than later - as the clock ticks down on his meritorious career.
“For me, the most likely scenario is that he will probably remain with Hangzhou because they won't want to let him go,” said Aliliovic, who initially took Cahill to China with Shanghai Shenhua, for whom he scored 12 goals in 28 appearances before being surprisingly shown the door in February.
“But there is interest from elsewhere and there will be talks when I arrive in China concerning Tim's future.”
Gallop met with Cahill - who is now on holidays in the Bahamas - during Australia's recent two-game series against Greece to try and reassure him he is wanted on home soil after the pair fell out in February when Gallop said the local competition “didn't meet Cahill's needs”.
He recently met Cahill to patch up their relationship, saying the governing body is “ready to explore” what it will take to get the Socceroos veteran playing in the A-League.
A conciliatory Gallop reiterated last week: “We are ready to explore the opportunity of him playing in the A-League, including looking at the off the-field activities that Tim is so passionate about including his academy program and other grassroots initiatives.
“Tim and I had a chance to catch up in Sydney. Firstly, it was a chance for me to reiterate that it would be fantastic to have Tim playing in the Hyundai A-League.
"Of course, that would require a club to take the lead in signing Tim, a process that FFA would support in any way we can.
“Whatever decision he next takes he told me the door is not closed to the Hyundai A-League and won't be while ever he is still playing football.”
Cahill, in turn, responded: I've never closed the door on the A-League. “It's obvious that there never has been any contact with me ... I never had a phone call.
“I'm very close with a lot of people in the league, but I can't press the button on anything.
“I think it's going to be left down to the big boss man of the league to decide what he wants to do.”
Markets on Monday will respond to Nicholas Sarkozy's electoral loss to Francois Hollande in Sunday's French presidential election and to parliamentary elections in Greece. The close alliance between Germany's Angela Merkel and Sarkozy saw the duo dubbed “Merkozy” in the European press. With Sarkozy off the stage, some global investors believe that a Merkel-Hollande pairing may become “Merde” in more ways than one.
Beyond election results, central bank speeches in America, industrial production figures in Europe, a slew of data from China and a number of key releases in South Africa are likely to make for an interesting week in the markets.
Here is your guide.
United States
America's economic calendar is relatively light this week but a few noteworthy data releases and a series of speeches from central bank officials will keep markets on their toes.
On Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) will release last month's small business optimism index. Despite a recent string of disappointing data, economists expect to see a slight increase from 92.5 in March to 93 in April.
On Thursday, economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect government figures to show that America's trade deficit — the amount by which the country's imports exceed exports — widened to $49.7-million in March after unexpectedly falling to $46-billion in February.
Analysts expect a separate government report to show that export prices increased 0.2% and import prices fell 0.2% between March and April. Investors watch these figures as a gauge of inflation and for their potential impact on bond and foreign exchange markets.
On Friday, the country's producer price index (PPI) — a measure of wholesale price changes — is expected to have risen 0.1% in April after having remained flat in March. Excluding food and energy prices, core PPI is forecast to have increased 0.2% last month, down slightly from 0.3% in March.
Beyond these data releases, investors will be scrutinising a series of public remarks from Federal Reserve officials throughout the week. Following last week's disappointing jobs report, speculation is mounting that policymakers may soon embark on another round of quantitative easing (QE3) — a policy designed to promote increased lending by flooding financial institutions with capital.
Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke will address a banking conference on Thursday. The presidents of the Richmond, Dallas, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Minneapolis reserve banks are also scheduled to speak throughout the week.
Europe
Investors will be watching markets closely to see how they respond to election results in France and Greece. Voters in both countries punished those who had supported the strict austerity measures championed by Germany as a solution to the continent's debt crisis.
Sarkozy's loss to Hollande — an opponent of austerity — was widely expected and, many analysts believe, already priced in by investors. The effect of the Greek elections is less clear.
With about 95% of votes counted, the only two political parties supporting the recent bailout programme from the European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were unable to maintain their joint parliamentary majority. Their loss raises the prospect of political paralysis as the two parties struggle to construct a unity government with smaller parties fervently opposed to the deal.
Beyond the election results, markets are likely to focus on a slew of European industrial production statistics scheduled for the week ahead. March readings from the continent's largest economies — including Germany, France and the UK — are expected to provide further evidence of a slowdown in the region.
German industrial production is expected to have declined 1.2%, year-on-year, in March following a 1.0% decline in February. France is expected to show a 0.5% fall-off. For the UK, analysts are forecasting a 2.5% decline in output.
Spain will issue its figures on Monday. Hungary, Turkey, Norway and Germany will report on Tuesday. France, the Czech Republic, Holland, Sweden, Italy, and the UK will follow on Thursday. And Romania will close out the week on Friday.
On the policy front, the Bank of England (BoE) will gather on Thursday to consider interest rates. Markets widely expect officials to leave the bank's 0.5% rate unchanged, but are less agreed on the prospects of a further stimulus announcement.
In February, the BoE expanded its bond purchasing programme by £50-billion to £325-billion. Britain's economy is shrinking and the country faces a lacklustre outlook but inflation remains stubbornly high. As a result, most economists do not expect officials to announce additional quantitative easing — which carries inflationary as well as stimulatory potential — this week.
Asia
A series of Chinese data releases will dominate Asian economic news this week. China — the world's second largest economy — will report key inflation, trade, industrial production and retail sales data on Friday.
The country's consumer inflation accelerated more than expected in March, rising 3.6% from a year earlier, but analysts at Bank of Communications — one of China's oldest banks — expect to see some easing in April.
In a report released on April 29, the bank said that food prices — which account for one-third of the basket of goods used to calculate the country's CPI — declined by as much as 1% last month. Analysts also forecast a 1.6% decline in non-food prices in April, bringing the overall rate of price rises to an estimated 3.3% for the month.
Markets expect trade data to show that China's export volumes grew at a rate of 8.5%, year-on-year, in April. Imports were expected to pick up a faster pace, rising by 10.9% last month from 5.3% in March. Analysts expect the country's monthly trade surplus to have widened from $5.3-billion to $9.8-billion.
Industrial production is expected to have edged up slightly from 11.9% year on year growth in March to 12.1% expansion in April. The rate of growth in retail sales is expected to slip from 15.2% to 15.1% over the same period.
Elsewhere in the region, Taiwan will report trade data and Indonesia will report gross domestic product (GDP) figures on Monday. Australia will report trade numbers on Tuesday. Malaysia's will follow on Wednesday, which will also bring bank lending data and current account information from Japan.
On Thursday, the Bank of Korea is expected to leave its policy rate unchanged at 3.25% and Indonesian officials are expected to hold at 5.75%. Australian officials may announce a rise in the country's unemployment rate from 5.2% to 5.3%.
Finally, on Friday, analysts at 4CAST expect Indian officials to report that the country's industrial production fell from 4.1% growth, year on year, in March to a 2.5% contraction in April.
South Africa
On Tuesday, the South African Reserve Bank will report reserve figures and Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) will release its quarterly labour force survey (QLFS). Economists expect the report's unemployment figures to remain largely unchanged. Analysts expect the rate of joblessness to have fallen from 23.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 23.5% in the first quarter of 2012.
On Wednesday, Eskom will auction R250-million in inflation-linked bonds. The utility said last week that the bonds will carry a coupon rate of 2.55%.
On Thursday, StatsSA will release March's mining and manufacturing numbers. Last week, data showed that the purchasing managers' index (PMI) — a forward looking indicator of economic activity in the sector that accounts for 13% of the country's formal employment — fell by 1.4 index points in April. Economists expect manufacturing production statistics to show similarly disappointing results, likely slipping from 4.1% growth to 3.3% growth.
On the corporate calendar, Harmony Gold will report third quarter earnings on Wednesday. AngloGold Ashanti will hold its annual general meeting and report first quarter earnings on Thursday, as will steel-maker ArcelorMittal
